### Stalemated Korean Negotiations: Soviet Delegation Withdraws to Pyongyang; China Proposes Discussion at the United Nations General Assembly

[United Press, Seoul, 20th] The Soviet Union's chief representative to the U.S.-Soviet Joint Commission on Korea, Shtykov (冈), verbally notified the U.S. representative, Brigadier General Brown, at 1:00 PM on the 20th that the Soviet delegation had been ordered to withdraw to Pyongyang. In a brief statement, Shtykov blamed the U.S. delegation's stance for making the implementation of the Moscow Resolutions impossible, while the Soviet delegation had "made every effort to accelerate the implementation of the Moscow Agreement... and to build a united and independent Korea under a provisional Korean democratic government."

It is reported that at the 62nd (and final) session of the Joint Commission last Saturday, the U.S. had suggested a temporary adjournment to await the handling of the matter by the United Nations Commission. However, Shtykov's statement on the 20th did not clarify whether the Soviet delegation's withdrawal was an acceptance of the U.S. proposal. Senior officials of the U.S. military government in Seoul uniformly believe that the Soviet delegation was dissatisfied with the work of the Joint Commission and unilaterally decided to withdraw. This is because the Soviet Union's active spy network in South Korea was exposed. In his statement, Shtykov attempted to place the responsibility for the failure of the commission entirely on the United States.

### Foreign Minister Wang Issues Statement: Korea Should Be Granted Independence

[United Press, New York, 19th] Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Shijie issued a statement here on the 19th regarding the Korean issue, advocating that the issue of troop withdrawal from Korea should be negotiated by the United Nations General Assembly and the four signatory nations to the Moscow Agreement. The full text is as follows: "The future of Korea is of great importance to China. The Chinese people and government have always maintained that the Korean people should be granted complete independence as soon as possible. From the Cairo Conference to the Potsdam Conference and the Moscow Conference, China has consistently adhered to this position. However, after two years of occupation by two friendly nations, a provisional Korean democratic government has still not been established, and the U.S.-Soviet Joint Commission has so far accomplished nothing. Furthermore, no agreement has been reached on the basis upon which representatives of Korean democratic parties and public organizations should consult with the commission. The negotiations of the Joint Commission have now reached a stalemate, which must be broken. If the two occupying powers or the four signatory nations to the Moscow Agreement cannot reach an agreement, then the only option is to refer the issue to the United Nations General Assembly for discussion. The Soviet government has already proposed that the U.S. and Soviet armies simultaneously withdraw from Korean territory, and China wholeheartedly supports this proposal. However, the U.S. and the Soviet Union bear a significant responsibility to the Korean people and the other two signatory nations to the Moscow Agreement. Therefore, it is imperative to ensure that their troop withdrawal does not plunge Korea into a state of anarchy or lead to civil war. If the United Nations General Assembly decides to assist in resolving the Korean issue, the Chinese government agrees that the date and conditions of withdrawal should be decided by the General Assembly, or by representatives appointed by the General Assembly to negotiate with the four signatory nations to the Moscow Agreement. For the sake of the welfare of the Korean people and for the sake of world peace, the four signatory nations to the Moscow Agreement must trust each other and must have confidence in the United Nations."

### Congressmen's Impressions of Far East Tour: Advocate Immediate U.S. Aid to China; Senator Brewster Urges Emphasis on Asia

[United Press, Honolulu, 19th] Representatives Hess and Herbert of the House Military Affairs Committee, returning from their tour of the Far East, expressed their impressions here on the 19th, advocating that the United States immediately aid the Chinese government, withdraw U.S. troops stationed in Korea, and maintain Okinawa as a U.S. military base. Regarding Korea, they stated that if a revolution arises due to the withdrawal of U.S. troops, it should be allowed to run its course.

[United Press, Washington, 19th] Senator Brewster of Maryland stated on the 19th that U.S. aid to China in the fight against the communists is of equal importance to the Marshall Plan for European recovery. He will request that Congress consider this matter concurrently with the European recovery plan. He stated, "The stability of Asia is one of the weakest links in Soviet policy. If we succeed in Europe but fail in China, I do not know what benefit this will bring to the United States. For the past two hundred years, the entire foreign policy of the United States has been encapsulated within the Monroe Doctrine. If we look forward to the next century, it can be summarized in one sentence, which is that there must be a strong China." Brewster stated, "To understand the East is as difficult for MacArthur as it is for the East to understand him. I will tell the President that if he appoints MacArthur in charge, there will be no communist alive south of the Great Wall of China."

### U.S. Generals Intend to Occupy Okinawa

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 20th] U.S. generals stationed in Tokyo consider the request made by Chinese Premier Zhang Qun to return Okinawa to China a difficult issue, as they believe that Okinawa is a key defensive point for the United States in the Far West. According to a U.S. journalist who recently visited U.S. bases in the Far East, most U.S. military generals in Tokyo, Guam, and Pacific bases believe that Okinawa is an indispensable link in U.S. defense in the Far East. Whitehead, Commander of the U.S. Far East Air Force, once discussed a plan to occupy the Okinawa main island for eight to ten years. Kenney, Commander of the U.S. Strategic Air Command, also recently told reporters during a visit to Tokyo that Okinawa is within the U.S. first-line defense zone in the Far East. According to the aforementioned U.S. journalists, the island is already full of permanent facilities of various kinds. The U.S. military has only built temporary facilities in many other areas of the Pacific, but on Okinawa, it is constructing concrete runways and barracks, and is in the process of building permanent housing for officers' families. According to these U.S. journalists, judging from the construction and preparations on Okinawa, it can be seen that U.S. generals are preparing to permanently occupy the island.

### ANALYSIS OF THE INLAND WATER NAVIGATION RIGHTS ISSUE

Since the visiting U.S. Congressional delegation openly expressed dissatisfaction with the non-opening of inland water navigation, relevant British newspapers have followed suit, vigorously advocating for it, thus once again arousing deep attention from the world. We would like to take advantage of the occasion of the visiting representatives coming to Shanghai today to calmly discuss our views on this issue.

Britain has a long history and many assets in the shipping industry. After the signing of the new treaty on February 11, 1932, which opened coastal and inland water navigation, it is natural for Britain to reorganize and re-manage the industry out of interest. However, the points it raises and criticizes may not be entirely appropriate. We will try to categorize and interpret them to reveal the true nature of the issue.

The resumption of Sino-British trade depends on the opening of inland water navigation. This is a point that the British delegation has solemnly stated. We believe that the resumption of inland water transport can indeed restore a portion of British business, but it inevitably weakens a portion of Chinese business, which is inconsistent with the true meaning of restoring Sino-British trade. From the perspective of the shipping industry, to truly restore Sino-British trade, we should start by expanding Sino-British ocean shipping, either by increasing tonnage or by opening new routes. This will allow the smooth exchange of goods between the two countries. Whether this task is undertaken by British merchants, Chinese merchants, or through Sino-British cooperation, it is something we eagerly hope for. The visiting delegation accuses China of implementing a closed-door policy, but at least on this point, it is completely baseless.

It does not hinder sovereignty. This argument has long been familiar, and many examples have been cited this time. They say that in Britain, foreign ships can go to London, and in the United States, they can go to Chester, Orleans, Houston, etc. But unfortunately, they did not mention at the same time that most countries in the world (a very few countries in South America, due to geographical environment and other limitations, specifically allow certain foreigners to enjoy coastal navigation rights, which is an exception) do not allow foreign merchants to engage in inland water navigation. They also omitted the Sino-British New Treaty and exchange of notes of February 11, 1932. Because the treaty clearly stipulates that "His Britannic Majesty relinquishes the right of British ships to engage in coastal and inland water navigation in China." If it truly does not hinder sovereignty, then why is this navigation right called a special privilege? And why was it specifically relinquished? It is precisely because inland water navigation rights are related to national sovereignty that China has repeatedly demanded their recovery, and friendly nations have generously abandoned them. Moreover, according to the general legislative principles of maritime law, foreigners cannot engage in such activities without the specific permission of the sovereign state. This is international practice, fair treatment, but it is mistakenly accused of denying international practice, being unfair, and ungenerous. This is simply overemphasizing their one-sided commercial interests.

Refusal to open is an obstacle to the signing of the Sino-British Commercial Treaty. In January of this year, newspapers reported that the difficulty in producing the Sino-British Commercial Treaty was due to our disagreement with the British obtaining our inland water navigation rights, while the British insisted that overseas Chinese in various parts of the UK should not be treated like ordinary people. According to this, the visiting delegation's claim that refusing to allow foreign ships to enter inland ports is the main obstacle to the signing of the Sino-British Commercial Treaty is indeed a fact. However, as mentioned above, our country has sufficient reasons to retain inland water navigation rights, and Article 24 of the Sino-American Commercial Treaty mutually reserves this point. In the Sino-British New Treaty, the UK even explicitly abandoned it. Therefore, it is unnecessary to discuss where the responsibility lies for the current complications and delays.

The British may think that since Chinese ships are allowed to sail to London, why can't British ships sail to Hankou? "Even a little reciprocal treatment cannot be given to foreign shipping." This sentence truly expresses their question. However, they do not know that the implementation of reciprocity requires the consent of both parties. Currently, our country has not demanded that British ships sail to London, so whether inland water navigation rights in the UK are open is another matter and has nothing to do with our country. Taking the United States as an example, foreign ships can sail directly into inland rivers, but the Sino-American Commercial Treaty makes mutual reservations, and this has not affected reciprocal treatment. It is like the United States advocating free trade and demanding that Britain abolish its preferential treatment within the Empire. Britain finds it difficult to firmly refuse, but the United States cannot demand its cancellation by saying that it is unwilling to reciprocate. The situation is exactly the same.

There are not many Chinese ships, which is not enough to cope. In terms of numbers, before the war, there were about 600,000 tons of Chinese ships, and more than half were lost during the war. This situation is indeed very tragic. However, after two years of effort, the total tonnage of state-owned and private ships has now reached 722,200 tons. In addition to the original Yangtze River and North-South Ocean routes, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has also opened eight overseas routes. It can be seen that there are sufficient ships to cope with inland water navigation, and there is no need for foreign merchants to overstep their bounds. Moreover, according to people in the industry, due to many incidents inland and a shortage of cargo, there are now more ships than cargo. In that case, if foreign merchants join in again, the result of fierce competition will only be mutual destruction.

The equipment is simple, and the handling is poor. Our country's shipping industry is still in its infancy. Coupled with eight years of war, the losses were heavy, and it is still impossible to fully recover it in a short time. In the eyes of the old大哥 of the sea kingdom, it is naturally not satisfactory. We also admit that the so-called simple port facilities and lack of trained crew members are shortcomings, at least in part, and there is no need to cover them up. On the contrary, precisely because we are aware that there are still many shortcomings and limited capabilities, we can only strive to improve and carefully cultivate during this period. We do not want to restore the previous state of open doors and allow the strong forces from abroad to exert pressure. As for reforming the bad habits of the docks, self-managing porters, repairing docks in various places, opening crew training classes, and eliminating bad habits such as forcibly demanding small amounts of money on board and investing in berths, we are actively promoting them. We believe that given time, it will not be difficult to catch up. If British merchants originally had industries engaged in this business, and if they are willing to sell them to China in accordance with the promises of February 11, 1932, and the Chinese government purchases them at a fair value, then the improvement and enrichment of all facilities can be achieved with half the effort.

Foreign ships sailing directly to inland rivers can save freight. This is certainly true and is currently the most attractive. However, things are not that simple, because although price fluctuations vary, they will eventually naturally adjust to a certain level. We do not believe that if British goods loaded in Hankou are indeed cheaper, they will always stick to the cost and not keep up with other general price increases. This is one reason. In this economically volatile period, price changes are not necessarily directly proportional to the amount of freight. We often hear that the prices of imported goods in Shanghai, Chongqing, and Hankou are sometimes inverted, that is, foreign goods in Chongqing or Hankou are sometimes cheaper than in Shanghai. It can be seen that the power of the freight factor is not as great as imagined. This is another reason. Although British ships sailing directly to inland rivers cite reducing freight as one of their reasons, foreign ships coming to Shanghai also collect exorbitant R.S.D. fees in addition to the regular freight, and they vary and are unlimited. Last August, it caused protests from the import industry in this city. In that case, whether the true intention of foreign ships sailing directly is to reduce freight is also difficult to ascertain. The so-called Chinese consumers must spend more money, and an extra middleman is inserted between producers and consumers, is probably just an excuse.

In conclusion, both China and Britain are currently countries with a shortage of resources. As long as foreign goods, foreign capital, and foreign shipping do not conflict with their current laws, they will be welcomed. After the victory, foreign merchant ships from various countries came to China one after another, and they were all allowed to enter and exit as usual. This is clear evidence. The term closed-door policy, if applicable to certain legitimate restrictions or regulations, is probably not being implemented by China. The preferential treatment within the Empire mentioned above can be used as further evidence. For example, Britain is currently experiencing a shortage of food and fuel, and the United States is willing to provide assistance. It is widely heard that the British authorities strongly demand that British ships be responsible for transporting these supplies. In our country, we are not so strict with foreign ocean shipping. Because what our country firmly rejects is only the right of foreign ships to navigate along the coast and inland rivers. This special privilege was obviously lost by corrupt officials of the Qing Dynasty during the Daoguang and Xianfeng years, and it was cancelled by friendly nations such as Britain and the United States during the anti-Japanese war and legally recovered. We cherish this recovered privilege very much and can clearly inform friendly nations: from now on, under no circumstances will this privilege be granted to foreign merchants again. Therefore, all plausible excuses and false accusations will not have a positive effect on bilateral relations and trade.

### U.S. NEWSPAPER DISCUSSES BULLITT'S SUGGESTION

[U.S. Information Service, Washington, 19th] The Christian Science Monitor commented in an editorial on the essay written by former Ambassador Bullitt in "Life" magazine. It stated that U.S. officials constantly preaching morality will not necessarily lead to reforms in Chinese officialdom, but such reforms are the most powerful weapon against the Communists. Bullitt himself admits the necessity of such reforms, and he even lists the various matters that should be reformed. These reforms, like a part of military victory, can be bought with money, with the belief that the United States can achieve its goal by spending $1.35 billion in the next three years.

If that is the case, then it is the most amazing deal in the world. To purchase lasting stability, the United States should be willing to pay much more than this price. But those Chinese politicians who crave power and the war-weary farmers will not be so easily commanded by the dollar.

To help the Chinese government rectify its domestic politics and economy, generous financial assistance from the United States is necessary. At the same time, in the current world crisis, the United States cannot be too picky about the terms of loans. This is also correct. However, wise self-help must become the basis for requesting assistance from the United States.

The Howard newspaper system stated: "Bullitt's suggestion is worthy of careful consideration. Bullitt believes that the Chinese government urgently needs assistance. We don't see anyone who can disagree with this conclusion. The United States has the legal right and moral responsibility to assist the recognized Chinese government. The obligations and interests of the United States are so obvious that we believe that the United States must assist small countries, but too much assistance is dangerous."

### FULL TEXT OF THE FOUR SUPERVISORY COMMITTEE MEMBERS' TALK

(Continued from page 1) "The main reasons for the recent price fluctuations are, first, the inevitable cyclical phenomenon of inflation stimulating price increases, and second, the frequent changes in the Central Bank's exchange rate since August, coupled with the excessive amount of goods arriving without permits, which the government has been unable to resolve for a long time. There were also rumors in Shanghai that the government would allow unlimited imports of goods with self-prepared foreign exchange, leading to a rampant and uncontrollable black market for foreign exchange. On October 19, Zhang Yuan, the president of the Executive Yuan, reported to the Standing Committee of the National Political Council that 'the soaring of the black market for foreign exchange is due to the Supervisory Yuan's report only mentioning the expenditure of foreign exchange, but not the income, so speculators took the opportunity to manipulate it.' At the same time, some people outside believe that the publication of the Supervisory Yuan's report on the use of foreign exchange is also one of the reasons for stimulating price increases. The main purpose of this report is to investigate whether the use of foreign exchange is appropriate and, at the same time, to explain some abnormal misunderstandings of the outside world regarding foreign exchange with a correct and fair attitude, rather than to make a settlement of the total amount of foreign exchange revenue and expenditure of the government. The publication of the report can only make Chinese and foreigners better understand the government's use of foreign exchange, and it will never lead to misinterpretations or misunderstandings. The source of the rumors must be that the bureaucratic capitalists and their henchmen are deeply afraid that the Supervisory Yuan and public opinion from all sides will be unfavorable to them, so they use this smokescreen technique to cause confusion and continue to operate to obtain illegal profits. Our hospital will continue to thoroughly investigate and severely punish this rampant situation of bureaucratic capital that fuels price increases and destroys government credibility, and we hope that all parties can cooperate in exposing specific crimes. President Zhang's report to the National Political Council not only failed to understand the nature of our hospital's report, but was also unwittingly deceived by the bureaucratic capitalists, which is regrettable. Moreover, before our hospital released this report, the black market for foreign exchange continued to rise, and the Central Bank's exchange rate was raised repeatedly. President Zhang did not seem to have paid attention to the reasons for this. Now, he blames the responsibility on our hospital's report, which is not a fact."

### ZHANG QUN'S LETTER TO SHAO LIZI - REQUEST TO PUBLISH HIS REPORT RECORD TO CLARIFY THE TALK OF THE FOUR SUPERVISORY COMMITTEE MEMBERS

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 20th] Supervisory Committee members He Yihanwen, Wang Guanwu, Du Guangsun, and Gu Fengxiang issued a written statement mentioning President Zhang's report to the Standing Committee of the National Political Council. President Zhang specifically wrote to Shao Lizi, Secretary-General of the Council, to explain the matter. The letter stated: "I recently read in the local evening newspaper that the four Supervisory Committee members of the Supervisory Yuan criticized my report to the Standing Committee of the National Political Council regarding the Supervisory Yuan's release of the foreign exchange report. According to my original report, when mentioning the artificial reasons for the recent sharp rise in prices, I emphasized the speculators' creation of incidents. At that time, I said: 'The Supervisory Yuan's foreign exchange report was intended to explain the government's use of foreign exchange and did not need to explain the income part. However, speculators took it out of context and falsely claimed that the government's foreign exchange had been used up, which was a one-sided association, intending to cause market fluctuations to benefit speculation.' It is very obvious that there was no intention to criticize the Supervisory Yuan's report. The "Central News Agency" did not include this section in its dispatch, but some reporters dispatched by various newspapers had fragmentary records, which the Supervisory Committee used as a basis for their arguments. Your council must have a complete record of that day. Please publish the record or send it to the four Supervisory Committee members who originally issued the statement to clear up the misunderstanding."

### FORMER AUSTRALIAN COUNSELOR CAIN'S TALK

(Continued from page 1) Asked if he had obtained evidence of Soviet aid, Cain replied that the weapons used by the CCP troops were black iron breech-loading rifles, which were also unmarked. The rifles are not owned by USA, Japan, and China. The only other possible evidence of Soviet aid he had found was unmarked black gasoline barrels, which were different from the American gasoline barrels captured by the CCP. Cain, in general, believes that the CCP has unlimited supply of gasoline and a large number of trucks, and the CCP has a large number of artillery, the only proof is that he saw the Communist army consuming 200 shells in an exercise. 50 percent of the CCP's weapons are made in Japan. UNRRA officials and the Communist Party have told him that a Soviet ship went to Yantai twice this summer and unloaded a large number of goods. As for what kind of goods, he did not know.

The CCP area is full of anti-American propaganda, and the walls are often posted with "American guns killed your son", "American troops raped your women" and "The United States replaced Japan's role in the Far East". There is also an anti-American movement in school speeches and newspapers. An article stated that "Truman is a mixture of Hitler, Mussolini, and the Emperor". The CCP hates Marshall even more than Chairman Chiang. On the contrary, pro-Soviet sentiments are very strong, and public bulletin boards are posted with "The Soviet Union is the family of world democracy" and "The Soviet Union is the cornerstone of world freedom". There are not many photos of Lenin and Marx, but photos of Stalin are very popular. Translated versions of Soviet literary books, especially the autobiographies of Stalin and Lenin and the works of Marx, are very popular. Cain inserted a paragraph about what he personally experienced, saying that once he participated in a seminar on the Soviet Union, he told the participants that he reserved his opinion on the Soviet Union's leadership in world political and economic democracy. After the meeting, he walked out with a 24-year-old boy, who slapped him in the face and rebuked him, saying, "This is to teach you how to talk about the Soviet Union in the CCP area."

### FISHERIES ASSOCIATION SUGGESTS UNRRA IMPROVE FISHERIES FACILITIES, POINTS OUT ERRORS IN UNRRA'S IMPLEMENTATION WORK

[Our Report] General Locus, the head of UNRRA, is coming to China for inspection. More than 40 units, including various fisheries organizations in China, provincial and municipal fisheries associations, and private fisheries companies, have jointly submitted a medical suggestion to improve the fisheries relief work jointly organized by UNRRA and UNRRA. Yesterday afternoon, at 4 o'clock, Lu Yanghao, Director-General of the Joint Office of National Fisheries Companies, and Dai Xingti, representative of the Joint Association of National Provincial and Municipal Fisheries Associations, met with the press at the 6th floor of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to explain that there were many errors in the fisheries relief work implemented by UNRRA: ① More than 100 fishing vessels of UNRRA were docked at Fuxing Island and have been scrapped. ② The Fisheries Relief Material Management Office of UNRRA is operating more than 40 fishing vessels and competing with old-fashioned private fishing vessels for profit, resulting in a sharp drop in fish prices and losses of hundreds of millions of yuan for private fisheries. ③ Fishing gear and cold storage machines discarded by UNRRA are urgently needed for fisheries rehabilitation, and they cannot be purchased on the market at high prices. They have been piled up on Fuxing Island for more than a year, resulting in significant losses. ④ The Fisheries Management Office of UNRRA employs more than 3,000 employees, who are idle and wasting funds. ⑤ UNRRA's plan to build sailboats to relieve China's traditional fisheries was supported by the Farmers Bank of China, the governments of coastal provinces, and the Relief Department of UNRRA, but it was not realized because UNRRA deliberately shelved it. ⑥ Recruiting and training crew members in newly established schools disregards the unemployed crew members before the war, and uses the training of crew members from various commercial companies as an excuse to assist the office in fishing and production for profit. ⑦ It is rumored that the China Branch of UNRRA and UNRRA are planning to form a "China-US Fisheries Trust Company", infringing on China's sovereignty. Subsequently, Lu Dai and other representatives of the national fisheries industry reiterated six suggestions to UNRRA: ① All fisheries materials that UNRRA has transported to China should be distributed to various coastal joint fisheries organizations immediately. ② Whether it is small-scale sales or small-scale rentals, the distribution price should be lower than the rental or purchase price of the current Chinese old-fashioned fishing vessels. ③ The money obtained from the distribution of materials should be kept by a joint committee composed of representatives from all parties and used exclusively for the development of fisheries. ④ The UNRRA Fisheries Management Office should be disbanded immediately, and it should no longer be allowed to distribute fisheries materials. ⑤ A joint committee should be formed immediately, with the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry as the competent authority, to take over the work of the Fisheries Management Office. ⑥ Training work should be handled by aquatic product schools.

### Coal Rationing to be Implemented Across the Country

[United Press, Nanjing, 19th] It is reported that, in view of the Communist bandits' destruction of transportation inside and outside the passes and coal mines, the government will strictly implement coal rationing throughout the country. Experts from the coal industry have investigated production and demand in various regions and estimate that the coal shortage accounts for approximately half of the normal annual demand. Three months ago, the coal shortage was 10 million tons, and it is now gradually increasing, and the transportation problem is also very serious. Government officials, in order to maintain an adequate coal supply for public use, transportation, and industrial purposes, are now considering taking emergency measures. Coal allocation in the capital has already been controlled, and it is still difficult to purchase even at prices above 5 million yuan per ton.

[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 20th] In order to facilitate transportation for the military and civilians in various parts of northern Jiangsu, the Jiangsu Provincial Government specially submitted a request to the Executive Yuan for an allocation of 12 billion yuan to repair the Tongyu (Nantong to Ganyu), Qitong (Qidong to Nantong), Huaiyang (Huaiyin to Yangzhou), and Huaifu (Huaiyin to Funing) four-line highways.

### Ministry of Agriculture Supervises Resumption of Cultivation in Disaster Areas of Northern Jiangsu and Hebei-Shandong; Anhui, Guangdong and Other Provinces Provide Seed Loans

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 20th] This year, in view of the severe loss of cultivation in the disaster areas of northern Jiangsu and Hebei-Shandong, and the inability of farmers to restore cultivation, which has greatly affected food production, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry drafted a resumption of cultivation plan for eight experimental counties in northern Jiangsu and Hebei-Shandong, and submitted it to the Executive Yuan. After approval by the Executive Yuan's Political Affairs Conference, a resumption of cultivation fund of 200 million yuan per county, totaling 1.6 billion yuan, was allocated. In addition, 2 billion yuan in resumption of cultivation supplies were pre-allocated to the four experimental counties in northern Jiangsu to facilitate the implementation of the work. Personnel were dispatched to cooperate with the provincial governments to organize resumption of cultivation supervision teams, led by a chief supervisor appointed by the ministry, and sub-teams were established in each experimental county to go to various rural areas to implement supervision and promotion. In the past two years, in view of the urgent need for seeds in the flood-affected areas, the ministry has also successively negotiated with the relief agencies of Anhui, Guangdong, and other provinces to distribute relief rice, noodles, peas, and other materials, exchange high-quality seeds, and provide loans to disaster-stricken farmers, hoping to combine relief with production.

### Control Yuan Discussion Meeting Passes Proposal to Postpone Election of Control Commissioners; Promulgation of Guidelines for Exercising Supervisory Power During Mobilization for Suppression of Rebellion

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 20th] The Control Yuan held a discussion meeting on the morning of the 20th, chaired by Liu Shiru, to discuss and pass the motion by Xiang Naiqi and others to temporarily postpone the election of Control Commissioners until the establishment of provincial and municipal assemblies. The reasons are as follows: 1. According to Article 91 of the Constitution, Control Commissioners are to be elected by provincial and municipal assemblies. According to Article 3 of the Preparatory Procedures for the Implementation of the Constitution, they may be elected by the provincial and municipal assemblies before the assemblies are formally established. However, only 24 provinces and municipalities have established assemblies nationwide, and four of them will expire this year. Twelve provinces and municipalities have provisional assemblies, and eight provinces lack both provisional and popularly elected assemblies. In fact, it is still impossible to elect two-thirds of the Control Commissioners. 2. The recent amendment to Article 2 of the Control Commissioner Election and Recall Law by the Legislative Yuan, allowing provisional assemblies to elect Control Commissioners, is a clear violation of the Constitution and the Preparatory Procedures for the Implementation of the Constitution. 3. The Youth Party and the Democratic Socialist Party have requested that one-fifth of the members of the provincial, municipal, and county assemblies be selected to participate in order to elect Control Commissioners. So far, the dispute has not been resolved. If the election is postponed until the establishment of provincial and municipal assemblies, this dispute will naturally be resolved. 4. It is said that the implementation of the Constitution must be uniform and consistent, and the election of Control Commissioners cannot be delayed. However, considering that the Legislative Yuan and the Control Yuan of the Five-Power Constitution are not a two-chamber system, there is no need for them to convene at the same time. Therefore, the Preparatory Procedures for the Implementation of the Constitution stipulate that the Legislative Yuan must convene seven days after the closing of the National Assembly, while the Control Yuan is convened by the President.

[Another Telegram] The Control Yuan has recently formulated and promulgated the "Guidelines for Exercising Supervisory Power During Mobilization for Suppression of Rebellion to Complete Constitutional Government." The full text is as follows:

Article 1: The Control Yuan formulates these guidelines to coordinate with the mobilization for suppression of rebellion and to implement constitutional government on schedule.

Article 2: The Control Yuan shall pay close attention to and investigate the promotion of the mobilization order and related laws by central or local agencies, or troops and their personnel, and shall study them in the following groups:

1. Finance, banking, commodities, production, and other items.
2. Military discipline, conscription, corvée labor, food, transportation, and other matters.
3. Public security and relief and resettlement of disaster victims and other matters.
4. Matters related to the implementation of constitutional government.

Article 3: If each group discovers that agencies and their personnel need to be impeached or advised, they may submit it in accordance with the law.

Article 4: When necessary, the Control Yuan may准组 establish military discipline supervision teams in designated areas, or the teams may send out inspection teams.

Article 5: These guidelines shall be implemented from the date of promulgation.

### Constitutional Government Association Joint Meeting, Sun Ke Explains the Problem of Party Nomination

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 20th] The Constitutional Government Implementation Promotion Committee held its fifth joint meeting on the morning of the 20th, presided over by Chairman Sun Ke. Vice Chairmen Xu Fulin and Hui Qi also attended. One proposal and two temporary motions were passed, as follows: 1. Committee members will go to various provinces and cities, and telegrams will be sent to personnel originally stationed in various places to earnestly investigate and handle election cases. 2. Two recommendations for election methods in the pacification area will be sent to the State Council for reference. 3. Committee members with party affiliations should request their respective parties to nominate them as candidates, which was passed.

During today's meeting, when discussing the "With the general election approaching, this committee should publish a message to the public to emphasize the importance of elections and fulfill its responsibilities," because the reasons given included clear statements to the national voters to respect the constitution and laws, elect the virtuous and capable, and strictly abide by election laws, after the proposer Chen Huanzhang explained, the committee members did not attach importance to issuing a declaration, but instead touched on the problem of party nominations. First, Li Hongru raised that party nomination is a true reversal of the meaning of popular election, followed by Dai Tianqiu, Jie Jing_, Chen Qianxi and others who also made heated debates. One of them believes that the party nomination whether can fu public view, whether really talented person, whether in line with the election is worthy of its purpose, and the party nomination, no different the three party bao election, and heard a Kuomintang Party to ensure the competing party, very undeserved. At the same time, since the party can set up units nominations, while the constitutional government is the country's constitution of the National Assembly, He reversed, can not become a unit, and join the distribution of quotas? Then, Sun Ke, Hui Qi and others carefully explained. Sun claimed that party nomination in Britain and the United States is the same, and the purpose of the three parties to negotiate, is still to enable candidates in the talent and status are superior, and not after the nomination is determined elected, the final in the voters their decision. Yan Qi said that our country's political parties, with the Kuomintang has the longest history, its assistance in competing party, is right. After the explanation, the general consensus in the meeting came to a standstill. The original proposal to publish the declaration was rejected because of the majority did not agree.

### Preliminary Results of French Municipal Elections Announced; De Gaulle Poised for Victory; People's Union Set to Become Largest Party; Communist Party Fails in Elections, Likely to Expand Strike Actions

[United Press, Paris, 20th] The Ministry of the Interior announced that, according to the results gathered on the morning of the 20th, in the municipal elections, De Gaulle's "French People's Union" received 41.5 percent of the four million votes cast, the Communist Party received 29.7 percent, the Socialist Party received 20.6 percent, and the People's Republican Movement received 8.2 percent. In the 90 seats of the Paris City Council, the De Gaulle Union will occupy 47 seats, the Communist Party will occupy 27 seats, the Socialist Party will occupy 11 seats, and the People's Republican Movement will occupy 5 seats. In the elections in other cities, the De Gaulle Union also took the lead. Due to the failure in the municipal elections, the Communist Party has decided to continue the strike of Paris transport workers, and will call for a national general strike if Prime Minister Ramadier does not allow the workers' demands. On the morning of the 20th, at a rally of 25,000 transport workers in Paris, Haynau, the Secretary-General of the Paris Labor Association, under the direction of the Communist Party, shouted "We have our own way to win!" The meeting voted to continue the strike.

[United Press, Paris, 20th] Incomplete statistics from the French municipal elections on the 19th show that De Gaulle's anti-communist "French People's Union" took a surprising lead on the 20th, so De Gaulle's party will replace the Communist Party as the most powerful party in France. Current statistics show that the anti-communist forces in France have gained a more than two-to-one advantage over the Communist Party. If the final statistics are the same as the current ones, then De Gaulle's new party, which has not been organizing an anti-communist campaign for six months, will create an unprecedented overwhelming victory in modern French history. Even the most optimistic of De Gaulle's party members did not anticipate exceeding 30 percent of the vote. De Gaulle achieved his greatest victory in the Paris region, traditionally controlled by the Communist Party, winning over 56 percent of the total. Marseilles, which has always been a Communist stronghold, was also captured by the De Gaulle party, winning over 100,000 votes, while the Communist Party won 95,000 votes. Some observers say that the sudden loss of power by the People's Republican Movement may force them to withdraw from the coalition cabinet of the Socialist Party's Ramadier. Other observers believe that, due to De Gaulle's decisive victory, the current cabinet may collapse, but it is not clear who will be able to serve as the head of the new cabinet. According to precedent, De Gaulle, as the leader of the largest party, should be able to take up the position. However, the "French People's Union" in the National Assembly

[Reuters, Paris, 19th] Today's elections for the French city councils are the most direct electoral battle in French political history between the Communist Party and the anti-communist faction. The enthusiasm for voting is unprecedented in all six elections since the end of the war. If the Communist Party can gain a decisive advantage in this municipal election, then the Communist Party may demand a new party to join the coalition cabinet, and if De Gaulle's French People's Union gains significant gains, it will also have the same political repercussions.

### French Civil War Crisis Imminent; Current Cabinet Position Gradually Becoming Unstable

[Reuters, Paris, 20th] The excitement and fear surrounding the possibility of civil war has now shrouded France, and De Gaulle's French People's Union has clearly overwhelmed the Communist Party in the city elections. The policies announced by the French People's Union at noon today are constitutional reform, support for the United States in the event of a war against the Soviet Union, and a demand for greater work effort from the people at home. This city election is the first election since the establishment of the Comintern Intelligence Bureau in Belgrade. On the eve of the election, General De Gaulle himself delivered a scathing speech attacking the Soviet Union. When De Gaulle's advantage has become established at noon today, serious troubles have begun to brew. Communist Party members have openly stated that De Gaulle's comeback is a signal of civil war. Some observers expect De Gaulle to regain supreme power in mid-November, meaning the collapse of the current French government and the germination of several new crises, in which case the crisis of civil war will become more imminent.

### Hungarian Opposition Party Criticizes Government's Attempt at Dictatorship

[United Press, Budapest, 19th] The leader of the Hungarian parliamentary opposition party, Zán佛, today attacked the coalition government's attempt to weaken the party with a disguised dictatorship. If this attempt succeeds, it will be tantamount to declaring the death of Hungarian democracy.

### Tax Revenue is Good; Municipal Finance Can Be Maintained

[Report from this newspaper] Municipal Finance Bureau Director Tian Yongyi told reporters yesterday that the city's finances have improved in the past few months due to good tax revenue, so the debt has been reduced compared to before. However, the 30% business tax and 40% land tax that should be paid to the central government have not yet been remitted. The recent adjustment of salaries for public school teachers and staff has no impact on local finances in other places because they have central government subsidies. However, Shanghai has never had subsidies. This salary adjustment requires an additional expenditure of 30 billion yuan per month. Because the tax revenue is still good, it can be maintained within the year. Director Tian said that the grain business tax has been included in the entire business tax budget, and whether to collect it or not will be in accordance with the orders of the ministry. He personally has no objections. According to Chen, the section chief of the Municipal Treasury Section of the Finance Bureau, there are two reasons for the improvement of the city's finances: one is the increase in tax revenue, and the other is the implementation of unified planning and expenditure. Since July, monthly tax revenue has been around 50 to 60 billion. The members of the National Economic Commission who were specially sent to Shanghai to investigate commodity prices consulted Zhang Yu-jiu, Xie Yu-xiang, Zhang Chao, Rong Yi-ren, Gu Yuan-an, and Xu Song-ren, leaders of the rice, flour, and cooking oil industries, to understand the actual commodity price situation.

### Cotton Industry Association Appeals to City Council to Cancel Restrictions on Hua Hao (Cotton Mark) Bills of Exchange

[Report from this newspaper] The Shanghai Cotton Commercial Association is dissatisfied with the central government's decision to allocate special funds of several hundred billion yuan to the China Farmers Bank and other institutions to purchase raw cotton, and the resolution of the Board of Directors of the Four Joint Offices on October 9 regarding cotton loans, allowing spinning mills to transfer funds for 30 days after bills of exchange, and requiring factory orders for Hua Hao bills of exchange. They have appealed to the City Council, believing that this move has the appearance of competing with the people for profit, and its consequences will cause unemployment panic for hundreds of millions of cotton industry workers, while the original funds will tend to be used for speculation. Therefore, they request that the central government be notified to cancel the restriction on Hua Hao bills of exchange requiring factory orders, and to grant them the same treatment as factories, allowing them to transfer funds in an integrated manner, and to allocate the original special funds of several hundred billion yuan in national currency originally intended for the China Farmers Bank to purchase raw cotton as special loans for industry members, or to have the government allocate special funds for designated loans.

### Partial Strike Again by Silk Weaving Workers

[Report from this newspaper] Silk weaving workers in the city had previously requested improved treatment and were arbitrated by the Labor-Management Arbitration Committee. Later, the arbitration committee ordered the employers to increase wages appropriately. However, the employers were unable to bear the burden and did not comply with the order. Therefore, from May of this year to the present, the wages have only been paid in the form of loans, and rice has been used for settlement. The workers have repeatedly requested that the wage accounts be settled and that the shortfall be paid in one lump sum, but the employers are still unable to accept it, and the workers are very angry. This has led to local strikes in the third and fourth districts from yesterday onwards, and workers in the second district are also showing signs of unrest. The Labor-Management Arbitration Committee is scheduled to meet today, and the silk weaving labor-management dispute is one of the important cases to be discussed. Yesterday, the department also questioned the Textile Coordination Committee to check yarn waste yarn numbers, including the Tongyi Yarn Factory on Qianshan Road, the Xinyu No. 1 Yarn Factory at 27 Suzhou Road attached to the Chengfu Company, the Xinyu No. 2 Yarn Factory at 8 Changshou Road, the Tongji Yarn Number, and the Yisheng Yarn Number.

### Coordination Committee Calls Rice Merchants to Discuss Improving Rice Rationing Methods

[Report from this newspaper] The People's Food Coordination Committee convened a discussion meeting with public rice retail stores in various districts yesterday to discuss improving the second phase of rice rationing methods. Rice merchants believe that the method adopted in the first phase, in which the district offices forwarded the rice, had many complicated procedures, which delayed both rice collection and payment. In the second phase, it may be changed to have each public retail store be directly responsible to the People's Food Coordination Committee, simplifying the procedures and speeding up the distribution and payment, while the district offices would perform supervisory duties. The Coordination Committee also expressed great support for this method and will convene district chiefs from various districts within the next two days to seek opinions, gather ideas, and make the rice rationing system more thorough.

### Cotton Yarn and Cloth Prices Rise Again, Xu Youzuo Analyzes Reasons

[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] Yesterday, cotton yarn and cloth prices tended to rise again. According to Xu Youzuo, the head of the Economic Section of the Police Bureau, the reasons for the rise are: Unlawful merchants are under investigation, and sanctions have not yet been imposed; the prices of cotton and dyes have not yet been stabilized, affecting the cost of cotton yarn and cloth; various yarn factories are holding onto their goods and not selling them due to strict inspections; the Transportation and Textile Adjustment Committee is holding yarn registration, and merchants and the public have different speculations, with some even secretly transporting goods to other areas, resulting in a decrease in supply and a natural increase in prices. The only solution at present is to severely punish speculative merchants once they are found to be involved, while also stabilizing the raw materials for cotton yarn and cloth, ordering manufacturers not to hold onto their goods and not sell them, and investigating the yarn and cloth that have been smuggled to other areas. All of these measures are temporary solutions, and the fundamental solution still requires the Textile Adjustment Committee to actively adjust the market's needs.

### Electric Chinese Typewriter, Priced at US$1,000 Each, Publicly Demonstrated Yesterday for the Press

[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] Gao Zhongqin, the inventor of the electric Chinese typewriter, invited the local press yesterday to the 14th floor of the International Hotel for a public demonstration of the electric typewriter. Mr. Gao gave a detailed analysis of its performance and structure, and performed three demonstrations to illustrate its uses. Mr. Gao said that the machine has a total of 5,400 characters, which is sufficient for ordinary situations. The first set contains 1,000 characters, which are the most useful in official documents, commercial correspondence, and various academic papers. These 1,000 characters are arranged very centrally on the machine, which can increase typing speed and make it easier to train typists. The Chinese typewriter can type an average of one character every four strokes, and can type up to 55 to 60 characters per minute at its fastest. Currently, there are trained typists whose records are over 40 characters per minute. If carbon paper is used, four copies can be made at once. With six months of training, professional typing skills can be developed. When this typewriter was demonstrated in Nanjing, personnel from the Ministry of National Defense and the Ministry of Transportation provided opinions on its functions, which will be revised appropriately in future manufacturing. Mr. Liu, a typist, was then invited to give a public demonstration, which was very successful. Gao Zhongqin told reporters, "Currently, there are four of these typewriters: one in the New York office, two in transit, and one in Shanghai. Commercial production will begin in the future. Currently, the factory is in the United States, but I believe that China's technical skills are very high, and I hope to set up a factory in Shanghai to manufacture them in the future. The cost of an electric typewriter is about US$1,000 each."

### Beautiful Corpse in Beiling, Shenyang: Murderer Botches the Job, Police Bureau Uncovers the Truth

[Our Newspaper's Dispatch from Jiyang on the 15th] It is the time of autumn in Beiling, when yellow leaves are falling. In front of Hanqing Villa, inside the roofless, dilapidated house of the former Customs Education Institute, a young woman tragically ended her life. She was pierced through her delicate chest by a merciless cold bullet. Even after death, her beautiful eyes remained wide open, and her vermilion lips were half-open, as if still asking people about the unfulfilled bitterness.

A beautiful young female corpse, about 20 years old, with a round face and medium build, lay supine in a pool of blood next to the stairs, her head to the north and feet to the south. Her left cheek was broken by a red copper hammer, the wound was 11 cm long and 9 cm wide, exposing blood and bone. Her left arm was bent, and her right arm was stretched straight, clenching her fist. Her half-open vermilion lips and slightly open, angry eyes were striking. She had permed hair, wore a blue velvet cheongsam, covered with a brand-new onion-green woolen coat, and her skin had a long, silky sheen. She wore brand-new white-edged, high-top canvas shoes, a white cloth shirt inside, and red-bottomed, small floral cloth shorts with a slit. Both feet were painted with nail polish. There were gold ring marks on the middle finger of her left hand, and watchband marks on her wrist. Next to the corpse was an octagonal pistol bullet shell.

### Forensic Examination of the Corpse

Guan and Chen discovered the female corpse and immediately reported it to the police. When the police arrived, the female corpse was still slightly warm, but had already stopped breathing. Guan and Chen did not hear any gunshots. The police immediately reported to the District Procuratorate and requested that an investigating officer and forensic doctor be dispatched for examination. Because it was a holiday that day, they did not go for examination until 11:00 AM the next day. For a time, male and female onlookers surrounded it like a wall. After the examination, the clothing was left for identification and the body was buried. The female corpse had nothing else on her body except clothing and accessories, indicating the murderer's intention to destroy evidence. Moreover, the clothing and the female corpse's body did not have any special marks, which made it quite difficult to solve this strange murder case.

### General Situation Before Death

The police bureau sent out detectives in all directions to investigate various entertainment venues. As a result, detective Ye obtained clues at the Asian Hotel at the South Railway Station, and the truth began to emerge. The beautiful corpse was once an "angel."

However, they denied killing anyone and said they did not know anything about it. Both Li and Jiang are suspected of serious involvement.

### Gold Ring Given to Someone

According to Wang Sumei, the deceased's companion, "This child is arrogant, has bloodiness, and is enthusiastic. She always likes young men and often gives her gold rings to the people she loves." According to another companion, "The deceased once gave Jiang two gold rings and a watch. Later, because Jiang showed amorous feelings, she wanted to return the gifts, which caused resentment."

### Minor Officer Li Zhonghan Confesses the Truth of the Corpse Case

[Special Dispatch from Shenbao, Pan Yang, dated 16th] The murderer in the Beiling Corpse case is confirmed to be Lieutenant Li Zhonghan, the paramour of Chen Suzhen. After the police obtained strong evidence, Li finally revealed the details. He originally hoped to frame Jiang, but his clever scheme backfired, trapping himself in the legal net. The process of the murder and the breaking of the case is recorded below:

On the evening of the 9th, Chen Suzhen and Li Zhonghan were about to go to bed when a military officer suddenly arrived. Li then went out and did not return all night, only returning the next morning. Li's jealousy burned fiercely. He did not lash out at the time but politely suggested going to the Bei Shi Chang bathhouse together. Because the bathhouse was closed that day, they agreed to go to Beiling for an outing.

Near the ruined house of the former customs dog breeding station in front of Han Qing's villa, Li pretended to need to relieve himself and went into the ruined house. The woman followed him in. Li immediately questioned her sternly about why her affection was not exclusive. Chen said, "Due to the pressures of life, I have to deal with all parties. You cannot interfere with my freedom." Li was furious upon hearing this and pulled out a gun to threaten her. Chen was not moved and said, "Don't try that on me. I've seen it all before." Insulted by these cold words, Li pulled the trigger, and the woman fell to the ground. Before she could breathe her last, Li repeatedly struck her face with a brick, finally killing her.

After committing the crime, Li returned to his residence alone. The police obtained clues and arrested Li. Li initially feigned ignorance, and upon hearing of the woman's death, he cried with his head in his hands, seeming very distressed. He then pointed to Jiang as the culprit. The police arrested Jiang.

Jiang claimed that he had known the woman for several months and had good feelings for her, but he had not seen her for a long time. He had not met her on Double Tenth Day. After several inquiries, the police realized that Li was the most suspicious and released Li to go home, secretly sending people to follow and investigate. After verifying the evidence, Li confessed that he was the murderer, revealed the details of the murder, and handed over the pistol and the gold ring and watch that the woman had been wearing. The police have now transferred the suspect and evidence to the court for handling.

### Unprecedented Grand Occasion at Gaolan Mountain: Gansu Provincial Games Grand Opening on Double Tenth

[Our Newspaper Lanzhou Dispatch] The first Gansu Provincial Games, amidst the refreshing autumn breeze, ceremoniously opened. Chairman Guo Jiao of the Games specifically emphasized the four meanings of the Games: Promote the spirit of martial valor, lay the foundation for construction, develop the spirit of enterprise, create glorious records. This time, the elite youth from seventy-one counties and cities of the province gathered in the provincial capital to observe and compete, and to select athletes for next year's National Games.

Two Thousand Athletes

The Games, after half a year of preparation, finally opened on Double Tenth Festival. The organizing committee appointed Northwest Headquarters Director Zhang Zhizhong as honorary chairman, Gansu Province Chairman Guo Jiao as chairman, and Gansu Education Director Song Ke, Lanzhou Mayor Sun Runan and four others as vice-chairmen. Bian Ren Guo Houqing, a physical education expert from Northwest Normal College, served as the chief referee. 984 athletes participated in the Games, belonging to eleven units. The total number of participants exceeded two thousand. The Games' original budget was more than 142 million yuan, but due to rising prices, an additional 125 million yuan was added, not including the expenses for each unit to select athletes.

Scene of the Venue

For three days before the Games, Lanzhou was still in a continuous rainy season. The authorities had considered postponing it, but the weather cleared up after the 8th, and the preparatory work was carried out overnight. The Games venue was located at Moujiawan at the foot of Gaolan Mountain. The site was flat, with the commander's stand facing south, and spectator stands to the west, north, and south. The commander's stand was covered with banners of various colors, dazzlingly brilliant. Around the venue was a white mesh track, with two basketball, volleyball, and tennis courts on each side, and a soccer field in the center. Within the venue, the national flag and the Games flag were raised high, with small national flags, party flags, and national flag paper flowers crisscrossing overhead, fluttering in the wind, complementing the majestic Gaolan Mountain and the ochre-yellow autumn fields.

Grand Opening

The opening ceremony was very grand. The national flag slowly rose amidst the sound of ceremonial cannons and firecrackers. Two reconnaissance planes circled low, adding to the solemn atmosphere. After Chairman Guo's report, Vice Minister Peng Zhaolan and Chairman Zhang Wei and others delivered speeches one after another. At around 11:00 am, after the athletes took their oath, they paraded around the venue, and Chairman Guo reviewed them. Over 30,000 spectators watched from the surrounding area. As the athletes passed by, drums were beaten and cheers erupted. After the opening ceremony of the Games was completed, various competitions began.

Wonderful Performances

The Games were scheduled for six days, closing on the 15th. In addition to group exercises, floor exercises, traditional Chinese martial arts, dance, bayonet drills, and acrobatic performances, there were also equestrian performances. Only tennis was missing from the various sports, which was a bit of a pity. Chairman Guo took the lead and on the afternoon of the 13th, he and tennis master Deng Zuqu and others performed doubles, adding a good story to the Northwest tennis scene. The reporters from Lanzhou also performed a 100-meter race on the 14th, with more than ten participants including editors, reporters, and field workers. Those who usually "run" for news, this time "ran" 100 meters. Although the "running" was the same, the "running" around was full of gimmicks, almost breaking the "lowest" record in Lanzhou.

Chairman Presents Awards

In addition to receiving more than one hundred awards including banners, silver cups, and silver shields from various parties, the Northwest Cultural Construction Association presented 700,000 yuan in prizes to add to the excitement. The central government especially valued this first sports meet in the border area.

Chairman Jiang, President Zhang, Chief of Staff Chen, Minister Bai, and Minister Zhu all sent prizes by air to Lanzhou, which was the supreme glory of this Games. The athletes also had a higher fighting spirit, and the competition became more intense.

### Rice Arrives in Abundance, Prices Weaken; Shantou Rises Sharply, Then Retreats Slightly

Yesterday, a total of more than 24,300 shi of rice arrived in the North and South markets. The South market was still weak in the morning, but the stores cleverly took advantage of the opportunity in the afternoon, showing a slight improvement. However, due to the abundance of arrivals, japonica rice was still lackluster, while indica rice was more actively sold. The North market was initially tight and then weakened, lacking the strength to rise. There was not much difference between japonica and indica rice.

White and dark sugar were sold as soon as they arrived, and the price remained stable.

Flour was lively and bustling, with prices rising by 6,000 to 7,000 yuan. At the close of the market, many sought to sell Wuxi naval ship flour, and the price fell back again. Bran sales were active in the countryside, with merchants from Zhejiang province buying it up, causing a sharp increase of 10,000 yuan. Soybean cake and oil residue were actively traded, continuing to rise by 5,000 to 6,000 yuan.

Soybeans were bought by oil mills, and the local market followed suit, rising by 10,000 yuan. Mung beans were actively traded in Southeast Asia, rising back up by 20,000 to 30,000 yuan. Broad beans had small sales, and there was no change in price for the time being. Cowpeas were purchased by merchants from Shantou, raising the price by 10,000 yuan. Red sorghum merchants were firm, following the rise by 10,000 yuan.

Corn had little supply and demand, and the market was stable. The arrival of raw materials was intermittent, and there was no change in price. Raw kernels were actively purchased by merchants from Guangdong, and the local market continued to move, gradually rising by 30,000 to 50,000 yuan. Sesame was inquired about by foreign merchants, and oil mills and local merchants bought from each other, soaring by 60,000 to 70,000 yuan.

In the oil market, Qingdao reported price increases, and the stores were still keen to buy. Soybean oil continued to rise by 100,000 yuan, and raw sesame oil also rose by 70,000 to 100,000 yuan. Sesame oil and rapeseed oil rose sharply by more than 100,000 yuan, but the factories saw more supply at noon, and the price leveled off slightly.

[Our Newspaper Report] China Merchants Steam Navigation Company agented for the Hua Hai ship, which arrived in Shanghai from Wuhu yesterday, carrying more than 41,700 bags of rice, most of which was military grain. There were also 20,000 bags of flour, unloaded at Jinliyuan Pier.

### Ministry of Finance Deems Credit Cooperative Checks Illegal: Orders Banks and Money Shops Not to Accept Them

[Our Newspaper Report]

It is reported that: Credit cooperative

checks cannot be regarded as legal instruments.

The Ministry of Finance has issued an order to all banks and money shops not to accept them. According to the Ministry of Finance's explanation: "Article 123 of the Bills of Exchange Law stipulates: "The payer of a check is limited to banks and money shops." Credit cooperatives are not banks or money shops, and cannot be the payer of a check. It has recently been discovered that many credit cooperatives have issued checkbooks, resulting in a large number of credit cooperative checks circulating in the market, which is obviously contrary to the provisions of the Bills of Exchange Law. In order to ban illegal instruments and safeguard the interests of banks and money shops, this type of credit cooperative check should be prohibited immediately. In addition to the Ministry consulting the Ministry of Social Affairs to instruct all credit cooperatives to comply with the provisions of the Bills of Exchange Law and not to be the payer of checks, and to recall the checkbooks that have been issued, the Ministry will also consult the Ministry of Judicial Administration to instruct courts at all levels not to regard checks with credit cooperatives as the payer as legal instruments, and will order all banks and money shops not to accept them in the future."

### Buyers Unwilling to Push Up Prices: Most Chinese Stocks Decline

Most Chinese stocks declined yesterday.

Many parties, due to the current environment,

were unwilling to linger and closed out their

positions. Supply exceeded demand. Rumors

that the Chairman was about to arrive in Shanghai further dampened buying interest.

The Commercial Press once fell to the limit, so outside funds temporarily watched and waited. The rise in utility prices made the stock market trend even dimmer. At the opening in the morning, Yung Shing was slightly lower, while the rest were relatively strong. Outside interest rates opened at 2 jiao 7 and 3 jiao 1.5 fen. There were many rumors, and buyers were wary. Supply exceeded demand, and maintenance was lacking. Near noon, the price gradually fell to a low of 300 yuan for immediate delivery and 307 yuan for deferred delivery. At the afternoon close, the price rose to 302 yuan and 312 yuan. The asking price after the close was slightly stable, but deferred delivery was slightly lower.

The remaining stocks were also dragged down slightly, but miscellaneous stocks were relatively stable. As a result, compared to last Saturday, immediate delivery shares of China Textile and Match fell by more than 10%, the Commercial Press fell by 10%, and Yung Shing, Wing Fung, Sunion, Tongyi, Towel Silk, Mayar, Xinhua, Hsin Ching, Lun Hsin, and other stocks each fell by half a percent. Xinhua decided to increase capital, and rose slightly along with Underwear. Sino-French, Sunion, King Fook, Lih An, National Goods, Tatung were all flat, while the rest were slightly lower. In the deferred delivery shares, Hwa Fong was flat, King Fook fell slightly, and Yung Shing, Lun Hsin, Sunion, Mayar, and Xinhua each fell by half a percent.

After the market, Yung Shing would rise to 308 yuan and 323 yuan, and the Commercial Press was reported to have fallen to the limit. Later, after National Bank exchange, there were conflicting rumors of differences in and out, and the situation stabilized slightly. The closing price was 305 yuan and 310 yuan. As a result, compared to the morning close, immediate delivery shares of the Commercial Press fell to the limit and then recovered, while Underwear, New Asia, Xinhua, and Sunion all fell slightly. Yung Shing, Sunion, Mayar, Wah Fung, Xinhua, Tongyi, and Zhabei rose slightly, and China Textile rose by half a percent. Deferred delivery shares of Yung Shing and Mayar fell slightly, Sunion rose slightly, and Wah Fung, Xinhua, King Fook, and Lun Hsin were flat. Old stocks outside the market were very stable.

### Limited Trading in Unified Bonds: Foreign Stocks Continue to Fall

There was limited trading in government bonds yesterday, and the situation was stable.

Unified C opened at 15,900 yuan, fell to a low of 15,750 yuan, and rose to close at 17,000 yuan. As a result, compared to last Saturday, A and B bonds rose by 300 yuan, C bonds rose by 1,200 yuan, and D and E bonds rose by 200 yuan each. The transaction volume was only over 1 million.

Foreign stocks continued to fall yesterday, with Hong Kong, Shanghai, Electricity, and Long Term falling. Only cold stocks were flat. However, Yi Shing rose slightly in the afternoon after hearing that HSBC could provide loans. Yi Shing opened in the morning at 166,000 yuan, weakened slightly at noon, and gradually rose to close at around 175,000 yuan in the afternoon. As a result, compared to last Saturday, Telephone and Tram were flat, while Yi Shing, Ying Lien, Industry, Guangyi, Airlines, Steel, Huide Fung, and Paper each fell by half a percent, and Wharf fell by 10%.

### Tightening Credit: Shortage of Cash

[Our Newspaper Report] Credit became tighter

yesterday. The dark interest rate rose sharply

to 2 jiao 4 fen, but it was still difficult to borrow.

The interest rate outside of the Chinese stock

market also rose to 3 jiao 1.5 fen.

Cash is even more scarce. Rumor has it that the authorities

plan on tightening credit. In addition, foreign banks

have also reversed their past accommodative practices and

have been assisting in tightening credit in recent days. It is also said that: the rise

in prices has slowed slightly, and merchants are liquidating the excess capital frozen in

materials, selling them to pay off debts. It is also the time of the month when various factories

and merchants pay wages. And rural autumn harvests are also taking place gradually.

A large amount of purchases are needed, so credit inevitably tightens. Yesterday, the national

banks collectively had an inflow of 19.8 billion yuan, and the Central Bank had an inflow of 1 billion yuan.

Large exchange had an inflow of 50.3 billion yuan, foreign merchants had an inflow of 16.6 billion yuan. Small exchange had an outflow of 86.7 billion yuan,

China had an outflow of 2 billion yuan, Traffic had an inflow of 19.3 billion yuan, China Agriculture had an inflow of 8 billion yuan, China Trust had an outflow of 15.4 billion yuan, Postal Remittance had an inflow of 8.5 billion yuan, and Cooperative Treasury had an inflow of 7.6 billion yuan.

### British Board of Trade Releases: Sino-British Trade Volume Last Year

[British News Agency, London, 19th Dispatch] According to the British Board of Trade, in 1946, China was one of the countries with a large amount of imports of British goods. The total export volume of the United Kingdom in that year was about the same as in 1938, and the export rate at the end of the year was 10% higher than in 1938. In that year, China imported British goods worth 758 million US dollars and exported goods worth 152 million US dollars to the United Kingdom. China is a major market for British wool yarn and fabrics and is one of the top ten target countries, accounting for 65% of the total British exports in this category. Wool is one of the ten main export commodities of the United Kingdom.

### Temporary Committee on Textile Adjustment Agrees: Cotton Yarn to be Jointly Distributed: Cotton Yarn Produced by National and Private Factories Must be Sold with Permits

[Our Newspaper Report] The Textile Adjustment Committee convened a temporary committee meeting starting at 4:00 PM yesterday. More than ten people including Du Yunzhang, Wang Qiyu, and Tang Xinghai attended. Chairman Liu Siying presided over the meeting, which lasted until 7:00 PM. It is reported that: the committee, in response to recent fluctuations in yarn prices, decided to implement a thorough joint distribution system in accordance with the announced textile adjustment implementation plan. That is, in the future, all cotton yarn produced by national and private yarn factories must be sold with permits issued by the committee, and a dynamic negotiated pricing system will be implemented. The specific measures for a thorough joint distribution system were generally approved by the committee yesterday, but they still need to be approved by the committee again at a meeting this Wednesday before they can be announced and implemented.

Cotton Yarn Rises, Negotiated Prices Do Not Move

Yesterday's cotton yarn

market situation was that, due to relaxed

credit, merchants from other provinces were active,

and new buyers were also very active, so the market

showed a rising trend. By the end, 42-count Blue Phoenix

yarn was made to a high of 33.5 million yuan, up 200,000 yuan from last

Saturday. Other count coarse and fine yarns also rose by 200,000 to 1.1 million yuan each. Throughout the day, the trend was that coarse yarn sales were healthier, and the market was also more bullish than fine yarn.

[Our Newspaper Report] The negotiated prices for cotton yarn at the Textile Adjustment Committee remained unchanged yesterday, with 20-count yarn still listed at 15.2 million yuan.

China Textile Construction Company sold yarn as usual yesterday, opening only 1,515 pieces of Group A to various manufacturers, totaling 2,115 pieces of 20-count yarn. A total of 728 manufacturers applied for the yarn.

Merchants from Other Provinces Actively Trade, Cloth Market Rises

Yesterday's cotton cloth

market, due to

recent declines,

industry peers saw low prices and snapped it up, and the market immediately became active.

Then, merchants from other provinces such as Changjiang, Min, and Han acted, and the buying interest was particularly strong due to the rebound in yarn prices.

Fine cloth once rose to as high as 880,000 yuan, but later fell back slightly to 840,000 yuan, up 30,000 yuan from Tuesday. Various other fine cloths followed, rising by 25,000 to 60,000 yuan. Colored cloth, broadcloth, and serge were in particularly strong demand, and prices rose by 45,000 to 110,000 yuan. The remaining cloths also rose uniformly.

Article 19 A registered commercial store,

### Female Corpse Gives Birth: Similar Incident Discovered in Yangzhou: Witnessed by Rui Jiaren, a Reader of Our Newspaper in Northern Jiangsu

I read the news "Female Corpse Gives Birth to Infant" on the third page of your newspaper on October 8. The original text was a Japanese newspaper report on the 7th about the news of a female corpse giving birth in a coffin, and it was said that "according to scientists from the Kyoto Medical College, German doctors discovered the same incident 55 years ago. According to the scientists' explanation, this is the corpse's stomach and intestines expelling the fetus." The writer also witnessed such an incident on August 28 of this year. The Zhenjiang Fuyun Shipping Company's short-distance ferry Yanghua sunk due to overloading and the driver's lack of technical experience on August 26. My brother Shao Yu was returning to You from Zhen on this day. When the news of the ship sinking spread to various places along the canal, many people inquired and confirmed that he had died. So I went to the location of the accident to find the corpse. When the prosecutor of the Jiangdu County Land Inspection Office was inspecting the corpses recovered from the Huo Family Bridge of Wanfu Bridge, a female corpse suddenly made a strange noise, and the crowd was surprised. They went to see it and learned that the corpse had given birth to an infant, which had rotted and was difficult to identify as male or female. The scientist's explanation is very accurate, because the female corpse had been out of the water for three days after drowning. The abdomen received too much water and must have exerted downward pressure, causing the fetus to be expelled from the body. I am deeply afraid that ignorant men and women will associate it with gods and monsters, so I will explain the process in detail. I beg you to publish it in the Social Services column, and I will be very grateful! Sincerely, Rui Jiaren, Fushui Town, Baoying County.

### Landscape

— Xu Weinan

Early Morning

A handsome young man in a dignified military uniform, driving a jeep, speeding like the wind on Dajing Road and Zhongzheng Road. Sometimes they arrive at the Kangle Restaurant, where young girls lift their admiring eyes, and a loving smile slightly raises the eyelashes; sometimes they arrive at the DDS Restaurant, where the band plays with extra vigor, welcoming their arrival, murmurs of praise flow from the mouths of young women wrapped in velvet chairs, with scarlet lipstick, sticking to his face, hands, and clothes; sometimes they arrive at the Seven Heavens Restaurant, where lively waitresses, gliding on their feet, rush forward, vying to serve them.

Seeing him, the young men hastily swallow the brandy in their glasses. Everywhere is laughter, everywhere is youth.

Noon

The night has covered the entire small village, trees, streams, and mountain ridges, appearing as silhouettes against the black curtain, fragrant and ethereal. The robust woman of some household, wearing a lake-blue Indanthrene cloth, holds aloft a torch with her bare arm, welcoming her stalwart husband home, leading him home with excitement. The surrounding hills, streams, and trees, illuminated by the faint light of the torch, eagerly swarm like fireflies, following closely behind this pair of men and women, wanting to send them to their glorious nest.

Dusk

Wiping away the last stroke of the colored clouds, gray, dark gray, one piece following another, overlaps on the pale clouds, and a thin silk curtain of night falls on the mountain city. Looking out from the depths of the shop, through the open doorway, there is only a misty frame, like fog and smoke. The shop diagonally opposite has gradually disappeared, only appearing particularly dark in the distance, and the movement of people on the street also seems particularly distant. Suddenly, on the opposite hillside, there is a point of light, followed by two points of light slowly swaying, dimming and brightening, brightening and dimming, moving down the hillside, disappearing when it reaches the street. The most ordinary flashlight, who would have thought it would become the director of a fairy tale in the twilight?

### Confession

— Li Weichu

I owe you a favor, this is

something I always keep in my heart; how many

times, how many days, how many years, I

cannot forget. I want to repay you,

to reciprocate you, but this favor is not an ordinary

favor, this contains your deep

heart and continuous intention, I cannot repay it like an ordinary

favor. Therefore, I am sorry to

you, I have let you down. Often I think of it, my

heart is blamed, I cry in my dreams,

my pillow is stained with tears, my eyes are wet; I think

I am sorry to you, although I do not want to cry, but

I silently allow the tears to flow freely.

Speaking of repaying you, it has left me many times

contemplating in my heart, calculating. I have also thought

of buying this and buying that to send you, or giving it to you,

but you know, I am incompetent, my power

is so weak, and the sea of material things is boundless; if

I were a god, I would transform

nothing into something and offer everything; if I had the touch of gold,

I would point to large tracts of wasteland as gifts. But

alas, it is heartbreaking; all I have is this

heart and this absurd and groundless fantasy.

Of course, my saying this does not

mean that you care about these things, I will naturally understand,

will remember, will recall how much you sacrificed

for me in the beginning; you loved me, you were wronged, how much you suffered

and devoted your heart; your tenderness, your

divine fragrance, your warmth, your kindness, I

will never forget until I die. Often when I think of it,

I will cry, my eyelashes will be wet,

you, you are not the same kind of person, but

your environment, your family, your relatives,

this makes me afraid when I think of it, my fragile heart

trembles, therefore, when I am still like

the so-called "disappointed" person in the world,

in this life, I will remember you until death, and I will

not casually run to show myself to you. … Although

I miss you very much, miss you, this is true,

absolutely true, I am not writing an article,

no one tells me, no one

knows, hidden deep in my heart, missing you, for the past eight or nine

years, every year, every month, every

week, I always dream of you once or twice,

and in the dream there is always obstruction, unable

to see you. Several times I dreamed of seeing you

among the swaying green willows, the misty green shade,

on the opposite bank of the small stream, I discovered you, I was choked with sobs

and asked you: "So it was you,

why have I been trying to find

you so many times, but they won't let me see you?" You

told me about the slight reasons, but

suddenly an obstruction came, you then left, I didn't see you

, so I woke up from the horror in tears. You know

, always, dreams are like this, always

can't find you, can't see you, sometimes when I see you

, you are called away by someone else. From here you

can know how this subconscious emotion hidden in my heart

for the past eight or nine years has come about.

Yes, I cannot say, should not tell

you, that I still miss

you at this time, but how can I not? In dreams

, I am always fascinated by your infinite

tenderness, let alone in reality? Yes, you

love me, that is true, the love of sisters, the love of friends,

the love of lovers, the love of mothers,

in you all are merged into one, completely encompassing.

Thinking of your tenderness, your kindness, your

gentle fragrance, your soft appearance, low, low

soft voice, at that time, I will cry

, you are the only unique person in the world,

I can never forget! In the misty

night on the other side of the bank, on the long journey

of life, you are a crystal clear star, forever

shining on my soul.

I say I am afraid of those people

around you, these are heartfelt words, you should understand

, I am separated from them by a world, an

era, and, for my kind of lifestyle, is it not even you who cannot fully

understand and condone it? But, for these

, I do not want to say, nor do I want to say anything, I

know that if you fully know everything about me, wouldn't you gently comfort me, tenderly pity

me, and sigh at the thinness of fate? You might

unbearably complain, gently blame

me? But, you, you don't have to! You should

know, you see, this world, this city,

this long street, this desolate and bleak autumn,

only the wind is constantly blowing, the trees are long-lasting,

everything else will change, and human life

will not last long, you should know that the things I do not pursue

are also within the scope of being lost, and what I

pursue is eternal, radiant and bright!

You, my star on the other side of the bank! I think of

you, countless times I want to cry when I think of you,

but I do not use worldly thoughts to think of you, at the same time

I would rather have my soul gnawed

by pain countless times, and I would not suddenly run to be with you,

you know my soul is more dignified than my appearance,

and my soul is stronger than my physique,

I have a sense of pride and the light of will in being human!

But, you should know that no matter when,

where, or under any circumstances, my heart

is silently thinking of you, perhaps, one day

I can't help but suddenly run in front of you,

I imagine that I will see the fear in your eyes

and the reserve on your face, as well as the surprise, panic, and confusion in your heart; afterwards

, others will know, and your

relatives and friends will secretly talk and criticize.

These things, are they still hard to imagine? But there will eventually be this

day when I will disregard everything! My courage

will be expressed in ordinariness - oh, my friend

! I have already been sorry to you, let you down,

but can I leave this regret for a long, long time

?

Alas, now I can only tell you that I

miss you, miss you, alas, truly,

I can only think of you this way. (36.9.29, Shanghai.)

### Four Chapters on Child Rearing

— Zhang Yile

Since the twenty-eighth year of the Republic of China, three sons have been born in succession. Whenever there is confusion, I hum and ponder. Recently, I found four verses in my luggage, and asked Brother Zheng to correct them.

First Son's First Pregnancy

Don't privately guess whether it's a boy or a girl, wishful thinking is especially strong when it's the first child; if it's born fierce like a dog, or brave like a tiger, just give birth to twenty and call them dragons. (Written in the twenty-eighth year of the Republic of China, when Shanghai was occupied, and I yearned for Shu, hence the saying).

Ke Long's First Month

The feast is open, and words of celebration are frequently seen, the son of a small family is now a new member of the family; I only hate that the nation is in turmoil, it is better to have soldiers than to have children holding swaddling clothes. (Written in the twenty-ninth year of the Republic of China, at that time the youths of the village enthusiastically joined the army, but besides my five daughters, I only had this swaddled child, and I felt deeply guilty).

You Long's Birthday

Even if the piglets and puppies are not mediocre, how dare you hope to raise two dragons; fortunately, they were born around the Mid-Autumn Festival, and their brilliance shines on our five ancestors again. (Written in the thirty-second year of the Republic of China, that year the second son You Long was born nine days after the Mid-Autumn Festival, which contrasted with the fact that the eldest son Ke Long was born nine days before the Mid-Autumn Festival).

Yi Long's First Birthday

Kind relatives mistakenly praise the little heroes, the three outstanding men are ashamed to be the same as those of ancient times; the country is not at peace, and people are already old, foolishly hoping that the revival of the Han Dynasty belongs to the children. (Written in January of this year, the third son Yi Long turned one year old, and relatives and friends praised him as our family's three outstanding men, feeling ashamed and grateful).

### Profound and Refined

— Sun Fuxi

Mr. Wu Lifu's cultivation in both Chinese and Western literature

is deep and broad, so his paintings and his person are profound and refined,

not comparable to ordinary vulgarity. This time at

the Shanghai Fudan Alumni Association, a painting exhibition was held, deeply

realizing the greatness of his art, so there are many feelings,

now briefly list a few points as follows:

The works in the exhibition are mostly landscapes, and there are

also many figures. In general, they are rich in strength and

elegance, each one, each stroke, either leaning towards

one, or encompassing both advantages. Such as "First Snow on the River Journey," such as "

Dongxi Road in Southern Sichuan," the boundaries are open and the brushwork is vigorous, all the

lines and colors are applied from a grand perspective, exhausting the spirit of firmness and pride.

As for the elegance, it is even more widespread,

in landscapes such as "Clear Summer in Lakeside Mountains," "Vast and Calm River Scenery,"

and in figures such as "Yuanming's Reclusive Ambition," even the works rich

in brushwork are all detached from the mundane,

intriguing.

Brother Lifu has traveled to famous mountains and rivers under the heavens,

especially during the Anti-Japanese War, he traveled extensively in the southwestern provinces, so he

wrote many works on famous attractions in Yunnan and Sichuan. I still remember

that when they were exhibited in the southwest, they caused a sensation at the time, and everyone

praised them. What I see this time is even more profound, pure, and skilled. Not only is the brush and ink smooth, but the artistic conception is also

more spacious.

The author's cultivation in Oriental literature and art

is high, so he is most qualified to promote

Chinese art internationally. This can be seen

in the works exhibited this time. However, merely imitating ancient Chinese paintings cannot fully

convey the ability of propaganda. There must be a new face

and new spirit of Chinese art in order not to lose the true

value of art. Brother Lifu deeply understands this meaning

, so the works exhibited this time should be mostly retained

for the purpose of promoting Chinese art when traveling to Europe and the United States. A few shallow views, offered for reference, hoping

for expert guidance.

### Two Poems

— Yao Hong

River

The river wind blows our clothes

The river water sings happily

Stirring up white waves.

We lean against the iron railing

Each describing the story of our hometown

My home is by the Yangtze River

You are a child who grew up by the sea

Don't hum that homesick tune

The boatmen living on the water

Rowing the oars and singing

Like on the Volga River

A cormorant

Flying towards the sun

Loneliness

On a rainy night

A stranger gently knocks on my door

I sit facing my own shadow

The guest's name is called Loneliness

In such a lonely era

We are abandoned by many

And our ideals

Let the wind blow far away

And our hearts

Separate from the embrace

How many nights I wait for you until dawn

I will abandon everything

I will travel far

### An Inch of Mountain, an Inch of River, an Inch of Blood

— Ye Jingfeng

"The only solution is of course to 'leave'. I originally

wanted to go out and take care of altering the clothes and other items," Yaoqun

still smiled, "so I took out all the money

I had with me and counted the amount. First, I took

out one hundred yuan and wrote a note, using slang and

colloquial phrases, explaining to Brother Hu to buy a hotel room

in the Three-No-Zone area in the afternoon, no matter what time it was, and wait

for me to meet him there. After writing the note, I wrapped it together with the one hundred yuan

bill in paper, and wrote 'Hu Cheng to open' on the cover,

and gave it to the older receptionist, telling him that he must

ask Hu Cheng himself before he could hand it over; and I entrusted him with a few more

words, explaining the appearance of Brother Hu, and then tied the remaining

money, and a few small tools for miscellaneous use, into

a small paper package. Before leaving, I told the receptionist again:

'I may come back at any time. If that wonderful buyer comes looking for me, you can tell him that if he is willing to wait,

he can wait in this room. If he is not willing to wait, he can do whatever he wants

...'

I am not familiar with Tianjin, but

I know that if I want to buy some odds and ends, ragged things,

the Three-No-Zone area seems like a very ideal

area; but I don't know if the Three-No-Zone is in the east or west,

south or north, so as soon as I went out, I jumped on a

rubber-tired rickshaw, and let him run for a while,

pretending to suddenly remember something, and called out to the rickshaw puller

: "Pull me to the Three-No-Zone..."

"That rickshaw puller stopped abruptly

and looked back at me, as if he was a little surprised

: "Big girl, isn't this the direction we're running in

right towards the Three-No-Zone?" I was caught off guard

by his question, and I was really stunned; but I didn't want to reveal

any expression, letting him see through my thoughts, so I pretended to look at the

direction, north of the street, south of the street, east of the road, west of the road, looking

around, as if I had recognized the location, and coldly nodded to the rickshaw

puller: "That's right, just keep running straight from here."

I listened to his narration.

I have been doing secret work recently, although I don't have

much experience, I have seen some battles. He has

experienced many risks. In theory, that buyer,

Buyashav, is not a tiger, so what's so scary about him? But I still

felt uneasy, as if something bad was going to happen,

and I became more and more unsettled. Because of my mental state,

my actions were inevitably a little strange. Although this street was

relatively quiet, there were still people coming and going;

I turned back several times to explore, and I always felt like someone was following me

. But I didn't see anyone who looked like Buyashav.

After each exploration, I always comforted myself,

"Didn't that guy go to some action headquarters?

How could he have the ability to be in two places at once, to track my whereabouts

..."?

"Once I got to the Three-No-Zone, I paid the rickshaw fare, and then carefully

scanned the pedestrians around me, pretending to be nonchalant,

and walked forward along the main road. After a few minutes, I

found a side street with a lot of pedestrians. It was probably the lively

central area of the Three-No-Zone. I casually went into this street, and after spending

a little time, I bought a few items of clothing for use, and at the same time, I carefully picked out a small three- or four-star hotel

to use as a place to stay. In this small hotel

, I used several dazzling 'flying needle and thread' methods to gradually alter

my dress and facial features, part by part. It took almost

an hour to finish.
