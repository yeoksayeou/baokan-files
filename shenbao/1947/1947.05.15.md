### Reasonable Suggestions to Promote Peace Never Rejected by the Government: Dong Xianguang Declares at Press Conference

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 14th] Regarding external reports that liberal elements in the Political Consultative Council (PCC) will launch a peace movement during the conference, Information Bureau Director Dong Xianguang declared at a press conference on the 14th that, as of now, the PCC Secretariat has not received any proposals related to the so-called peace movement. As for any reasonable suggestions to promote peace and unity, the government has never refused to consider them. However, past experiences have been very disappointing to the government, so empty talk of peace will not help the current situation. The government's approach to achieving unification and democracy will not change. Furthermore, the request by three PCC members, Xu Deheng and others, to Secretary-General Shao to dispatch a plane to welcome Communist Party PCC members to Nanjing to attend this session of the PCC has been replied to by Shao. If they intend to come to Nanjing, it will be easy to arrange. The text of Shao's reply to PCC members Xu Deheng, Zhou Binglin, and Qian Duansheng is as follows: "Your letter of the 6th was received yesterday afternoon. The meeting notice for the Communist Party PCC members has been forwarded via telegram to Mr. Wu Yunfu, who is working in the Xingzong of the Communist Party. If we receive a reply, then your proposal to send a plane to welcome them can be easily implemented. However, given the Communist Party's attitude towards the PCC in recent years and their rejection of General Zhang Wenbo's visit to Yan'an in January of this year, I fear there will be no positive response. I also worry that they will again label this proposal as a peace offensive and ridicule it, which would be not only useless but also harmful! I greatly admire your sincerity and profound insights. I will consult with the government in detail. I still hope you will come to Nanjing as soon as possible so that I can consult with you at any time. With best wishes, Shao Lizi bows."

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 14th] The Executive Yuan's Information Bureau held a press conference at 4:30 PM on the 14th. Director Dong Xianguang answered reporters' questions as follows:

Question: What is the government's attitude towards the Democratic League?

Answer: The Democratic League and the Chinese Communist Party have publicly denied the legitimacy of the Constitution and the National Assembly. The League has a close relationship with the Chinese Communist Party, which is rebelling against the government. Although it still claims to be a peaceful political party, the government's attitude towards the League will depend on its policies and actions.
Question: How many political parties are there in China, that is, besides those participating in the Political Consultative Conference, how many other parties are there? How many political parties that did not participate in the PCC are recognized by the government? Can political parties that did not participate in the PCC participate in elections?

Answer: Currently, in addition to the political parties participating in the PCC, there are also several other political parties active, but the exact number is difficult to determine. All citizens of the Republic of China can participate in the elections in accordance with the provisions of the Election Law, and it is not necessary for candidates to be nominated by political parties.

No Change in Xinjiang Situation; No News of Replacing Provincial Chairman

Question: What is the current situation in Xinjiang? How many central government troops are stationed in the province? It is rumored that Chairman Zhang Zhizhong will soon be transferred; is this true?

Question: It is rumored that Zhang Xueliang may be released in the near future. Is this statement accurate?
Answer: There is no new information to report regarding Zhang Xueliang.

Question: Has Li Huang given a definite answer on whether to accept or reject the position of Minister of Economic Affairs?

Answer: The government has not yet received a definite answer from Li Huang regarding his acceptance or rejection of the position of Minister of Economic Affairs.

Question: Has a definite plan been formulated regarding the de-freezing of the cost of living index?

Answer: The government is still studying this issue.

Question: Since the end of the war, has foreign exchange been allocated to universities for the purchase of books and equipment? If so, what is the amount? Where does the funding for the Three Principles of the People Youth League come from?

Answer: Regarding the allocation of foreign exchange to subsidize universities for the purchase of books and equipment, US$200,000 was allocated in the US Lend-Lease Act in 1940, and US$800,000 was allocated in the US credit loan in 1941. However, due to transportation difficulties, the purchase and transportation have not yet been completed. In 1946, another US$500,000 in foreign exchange was allocated to various schools, but due to the promulgation of emergency economic measures, it has not yet been distributed. In the same year, an application was made to the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) for a subsidy of US$4 million for equipment for agricultural, industrial, and medical colleges that suffered losses due to the war. People are being sent to the United States to negotiate purchases and transportation. In 1947, US$800,000 in foreign exchange was also listed under the education budget and is being distributed. The Youth League's funding is no longer included in the national budget this year; thereafter, the party and league's funding will be self-raised and no longer borne by the government. When asked about the recent situation in the Shandong war, Director Fei replied that the government is satisfied with the recent progress in the Shandong war.

### Taiyuan Grain Prices Soar; Wheat at 420,000 per Shi

[Our Taiyuan Dispatch, 13th] Taiyuan's fine prices are rising in a straight line. At the beginning of the month, wheat was 260,000 yuan per shi, but it has now risen to 420,000 yuan.

### Xi'an Flour Prices Continue to Rise; Evaluated Price Higher Than Black Market

[Our Xi'an Dispatch, 14th] Xi'an flour prices have continued to rise in the past month. On May 7, the Municipal Price Evaluation Council evaluated the price at 79,000 yuan per bag, but within five days, it rose again to 104,000 yuan. Many believe that the new price adjustment far exceeds the rate of change in grain prices during the same period, and the new price is higher than the black market price. Therefore, hoarders of flour have released their stocks, and wheat prices have immediately risen in succession, followed by general merchandise. The public is in an uproar. This morning, reporters in the city collectively interviewed Mayor Zhang for three hours to ask for an explanation. Zhang finally said: As long as prices are stable in the future, the municipal government will definitely lower the current new price. However, many believe that lowering the current excessively high new evaluation should be implemented immediately.

### New Dispute Between Britain, America, and Soviet Union to Arise Over Japan Peace Treaty Issue; US Denies Discussing with Other Countries

[Central News Agency, Washington, 13th, United Press] When answering questions about rumors that Britain and the United States were discussing the Japanese peace treaty, a State Department spokesman said that the United States had not discussed this issue with any other country.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 13th] According to a report in today's Washington Post, the drafting and negotiation of the Japanese peace treaty will not go through the Foreign Ministers' Conference. The US and Britain have decided to break the old practice of the four powers drafting European treaties independently. Marshall believes that other countries that have fought with Japan must participate in the treaty process, starting from the initial drafting of the treaty if possible. Bevin also agreed to the above conclusion at the Moscow Conference. This opinion is the result of repeated opposition from Canada and Australia to the four or five powers monopolizing the initial stage of treaty negotiations. Bevin also assured the autonomous territories that the procedures for European treaties will not be repeated in the Far East. According to the report: Marshall is currently studying possible institutions to replace the Foreign Ministers' Conference in the Japanese peace treaty, but this point has not yet been decided. The Post stated: "Judging from various signs, the eleven-nation Far Eastern Commission seems to be the institution for drafting the Japanese peace treaty, or at least an institution modeled after it. The opinions of Britain and the United States on the Japanese peace treaty seem certain to cause new disputes with the Soviet Union, as the Soviet Union will undoubtedly oppose all eleven countries participating in the main process of drafting the treaty." The report said: Britain and the United States will directly refuse to exclude the above-mentioned countries from the process of concluding the treaty.

### Shanghai Star Line Ocean Liner Fails in Operation; Overseas Chinese Disappointed

[Central News Agency, Singapore, 13th] The desire of overseas Chinese to return to their country on domestic ships, which they had eagerly hoped for, has been destroyed due to the operational failures of the Far Eastern Shipping Company. The company sent its first ship, the "Ocean"号, back and forth between Singapore and Shanghai (via Xiamen, Hong Kong, and Bangkok). The company was recently established in Shanghai, and its capital is entirely owned by Chinese. A branch office was set up in Singapore, and overseas Chinese paid close attention to the company's news. Many overseas Chinese even gave up the opportunity to travel on foreign ships in order to travel on the company's new ship. Although the ship had changed its arrival date several times, they still waited patiently without complaint. The ship even sold pre-sale tickets before its arrival. However, the reality was completely contrary to the wishes of the overseas Chinese. First, the ship was originally built for sailing in cold regions, so its first-class cabins were specially set up around the machine room, which seemed too warm for sailing in tropical regions. Second, the water supply was insufficient, the sanitary facilities were very poor, and there was nothing to be comfortable about. Third, the company authorities only knew how to make money and did not care about the comfort and safety of passengers. The ship was officially only allowed to carry 300 passengers, but the company sold more than 1,000 tickets. In order to avoid trouble entering Hong Kong, the company even ordered the ship to stop at Xiamen first so that a large number of passengers could disembark before returning to Hong Kong to avoid complicated procedures. However, this plan was not approved by the Singapore authorities, so the ship, which was originally scheduled to leave here on the 10th, was not approved. The matter is still under negotiation, and the departure date has not been determined. Overseas Chinese are all悲愤, and local newspapers have also strongly criticized the company authorities' mishandling. This matter is not only a blow to the company's business, but also reduces the confidence of overseas Chinese in ships operated by Chinese.

### Debt Relations Between Central Bank and Government to be Cleared Up; In Order to Clarify Currency Issuance Situation

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 14th] It is learned that the financial authorities will begin clearing up the debt relations between the Central Bank and the government in the near future in order to clarify the currency issuance situation. After this work is completed, it may be recommended to the highest authorities to make the issuance figures public to dispel doubts. Compared with the multiple of price increases, the amount of paper money issued in our country is very different. Generally, those who are unaware of this overestimate the amount of issuance, which is the main factor in the current economic instability. Some economic experts have long suggested making the issuance figures public.

### Tragic Murder, Robbery, and Arson Occurs in Shaoyang City, Hunan; Secretary of the Commissioner's Office Highly Suspected

[Central News Agency, Changsha, 12th] A murder, robbery, and arson occurred in Shaoyang recently, with the secretary of the Xiangda District Commissioner's Office, Fu Deming, highly suspected of robbery and silencing witnesses, shocking the entire province. The Yonghe Gold Shop on Dongzhi Street in the county seat suddenly caught fire at about 5:00 AM on the 4th of this month. After it was extinguished, it was discovered that four people in the first shop room had been poisoned, and one person had been killed. A charred body was found in the middle fire scene, making it difficult to identify. Three people in the rear had been poisoned. After investigation, it was discovered that the murdered person was shop assistant Rao Wenqing, who had been stabbed fourteen times, with his flesh and blood blurred. After being treated and regaining consciousness, the poisoned shop assistants testified: At about 9:00 PM on the 3rd of this month, Secretary Fu from the Commissioner's Office came to the shop and immediately closed the door tightly. He showed a warrant from the Commissioner, which read, "All personnel of Yonghe Gold Shop are to be taken into custody." He then took out a package of pills with the words "Truth Pills" written on it and forced everyone to take ten pills each. Fearing his power, everyone except the manager, Rao Wenqing, swallowed the pills and fell unconscious. They knew nothing about the subsequent fire and murders. It is said that the shop manager, Tian Ruiqing, was falsely accused of being a Communist Party suspect some time ago. After being arrested and interrogated by the Commissioner's Office, he was soon released. During this period, someone threatened the shop, intending to extort money. The shop assistants used the excuse that the shop owner was not present, and their demands were not met, eventually leading to the tragic incident. It may have been the last resort of the gangsters, using arson, robbery, poisoning, and murder to silence witnesses. After the incident, Sixth District Commissioner Sun Zuoqi's attitude was ambiguous, and his words were partial to a certain person. To this day, he has not actively investigated the case. Local gentry and merchants are indignant and have organized a support association, calling for the swift punishment of the mastermind to avenge the dead. The county's local court has detained and interrogated Fu, believing that he is highly suspected. Newspapers in Changsha have published editorials expressing their anger, unanimously advocating for a thorough investigation and strict punishment to maintain discipline and stabilize public sentiment. The Hunan Provincial Government has sent a senior official to conduct a thorough investigation.

Editorial

### Improvement in Rice Rationing Methods

The city's improved measures for rice rationing have now been finalized: on one hand, price controls and forced sales are abolished to restore free trade in rice; on the other hand, localized rationing with price and quantity limits is implemented to stabilize people's livelihoods. These two methods, implemented simultaneously, have four advantages: (1) Unobstructed supply, preventing merchants from being hampered by the large gap between production and sales prices; (2) Natural adjustment, ensuring merchants can still earn legitimate profits; (3) The rationing system can restrain the free market, indirectly moderating prices; (4) Even if the rice market becomes erratic, workers, civil servants, teachers, students, and laborers can still receive rationed rice at reasonable prices, preventing panic. Therefore, before sufficient public rice is available for comprehensive rationing, this measure is reasonably satisfactory.

The rationing methods for workers and teachers/students have been officially announced; how to ration rice to the poor is still being planned. Based on past experiences with subsidized rice sales in various regions and the Social Affairs Bureau's subsidized flour program last year, several points are worth mentioning to the authorities and the public:

1.  The definition of "poor" must be clear and specific, making it easy for investigators and applicants to follow.

2.  The investigation process must rely on the heads of the Baojia (neighborhood units) in each district to take responsibility, ensuring diligence and preventing both omissions and over-inclusions, so that genuinely poor people can benefit.

3.  The register of the poor and subsidized rice coupons must be carefully prepared to facilitate inspection and prevent abuse.

4.  The distribution locations and times must be appropriately coordinated to maintain order and save the public from unnecessary travel.

5.  The most ideal method is to establish separate subsidized rice sale locations, managed with the help of local self-government personnel, to clearly delineate responsibilities. If entrusted to rice shops, the time period must be clearly specified; during that time, free trade should be temporarily suspended to avoid misunderstandings.

6.  Sample rice, prices, dates, and locations must be clearly displayed or labeled so that the public is well informed.

7.  The district police and Baojia should jointly oversee order and inspection to ensure thoroughness.

The most crucial factors are accurate timing, simple procedures, and orderly execution. Past subsidized rice sales often encountered problems, invariably due to these issues. Achieving satisfactory results requires thorough preparation, cooperation among relevant agencies, and public adherence to order.

As for the free rice market, since the authorities have lifted price controls and local governments in production areas have allowed free circulation, fair trade can resume its normal state. However, to promote circulation and increase supply, we believe two matters are worth discussing.

First, regarding the review of purchase permits: rice is not a prohibited item, and if free purchase is allowed, why is it still necessary to apply for a purchase permit? And why does it still require verification and approval from the local government? Can't these unnecessary procedures be eliminated? Some believe that obtaining a purchase permit can avoid many difficulties and troubles, which is indeed helpful in practice. We also know that this is true, and even with a purchase permit, difficulties and troubles are sometimes unavoidable. This proves that free circulation has not been fully achieved in practice. We urge local governments to strictly adhere to government orders and make real improvements.

Second, regarding hoarding and bringing rice into the city: this city has a large population, and supply is sometimes insufficient, so there is a need to encourage bringing rice into the city. I remember that in the past, the municipal government had various incentive measures for bringing rice to Shanghai. To this day, they have not been explicitly canceled. Therefore, bringing rice to Shanghai should at least be freely permitted, regardless of whether the person is a rice merchant. According to Article 3 of the regulations prohibiting hoarding and speculation, only non-industry people who buy and store large quantities are prohibited, not those who transport it. Therefore, anyone bringing rice to Shanghai cannot be considered illegal. As for hoarding rice and speculating on prices, which harms the public's food supply, it is naturally unacceptable to the law. However, the meaning of "hoarding" is also somewhat ambiguous in the law. According to the term "large quantity" in the aforementioned article, what specific quantity constitutes a "large quantity" and "hoarding" seems to require clear definition. This easily causes disputes during enforcement, and those in the industry cannot help but feel uneasy and have many concerns. To facilitate the flow of supply, in addition to cracking down on hoarding and preventing speculation, it is also hoped that legitimate rice merchants will be protected to replenish reserves. Therefore, we earnestly hope that the government can further define the boundaries of hoarding appropriately and clearly so that legitimate merchants know what to do. This is of no small consequence to the future of the people's food supply.

### US Senate Passes Bill Restricting Union Activities by a Majority Congress and Government Differ on Views

[Reuters, Washington, 13th] The Senate today passed a labor bill restricting strikes and union activities by a vote of 68 to 24. The bill has previously been passed by the House of Representatives, and it will now be handed over to a joint committee of the two houses to reconcile the amendments passed by the two houses. The Senate's passage of the bill may cause the Republican-controlled Congress to have its first serious conflict with the government, as government spokesmen have made harsh criticisms and objections during the debate of the bill in both houses. Therefore, it is expected that the bill may be vetoed by the President when it is submitted for signature. After the veto, it should be returned to Congress for reconsideration. If the original bill is maintained by a two-thirds majority, it will become final. The Republican side is confident that it will be able to obtain this two-thirds majority in the reconsideration. Otherwise, they said they will never draft a new bill to cater to the White House's intentions.

### Mayor Wu and Others Toiled Through the Night to Persuade Jiaotong University Students to Return to School Traffic on Both Lines Resumed to Normal Education Minister Zhu Gave Written Guarantee of Five Resolution Measures

[Reported by this Newspaper] The students of National Jiaotong University petitioned to Beijing to protest the Ministry of Education's decision to suspend the two departments of marine engineering and navigation. They were deadlocked at the North Station for a day and automatically drove the train to Zhenru late at night. After Education Minister Zhu Jiajun personally rushed to Zhenru to dissuade them, and after the efforts of Mayor Wu, Speaker Pan, President Wu, and Deputy Director Ling and Director Zhao of the Alumni Association, the issue was resolved at about 8 a.m. yesterday. All the students were then transported back to the school by dozens of trucks dispatched by the Municipal Government, but the entire school continued to strike yesterday.

At about 2 a.m. yesterday, Minister Zhu rushed to the Jiao Tong University petitioner train at Zhenru and broadcast to the students: "Your request has been promised, I hope you will return to school quickly." But at that time, the students were still not satisfied and insisted on continuing to petition to Beijing. After Minister Zhu finished speaking, he returned to the urban area. Mayor Wu and Jiao Tong University alumni, professors, etc. continued to persuade with painstaking efforts. After repeated explanations, the student representatives stated: the five solutions and the revision of the independent establishment of the marine engineering department, agreed upon by Tian Ciwei and Jiao Tong University professors on the morning of the day before yesterday, must obtain a written guarantee from Minister Zhu. Secondly, the students' request to increase school building facilities, increase the number of publicly funded quotas, and the merger of Tangshan Branch and Peiping Railway Management College into Jiaotong University must still be achieved. The alumni and professors present immediately guaranteed that the Alumni Association would be responsible for negotiating the requests for increased school building and other requests, and persuaded the students to take the overall situation into consideration and jointly maintain the school's reputation. On the one hand, Mayor Wu rushed back to Minister Zhu to obtain the Minister's handwritten signature approving the five replies and brought it to the students. At this point, all the students, after voting, finally dismissed the idea of ​​insisting on petitioning to Beijing and were sent back to the school in batches by trucks from the Municipal Government. It was already dawn when the mayor and others returned. Yesterday afternoon, the reporter drove to Jiaotong University. The gate was quiet, and most of the students had returned home or were resting in the dormitory. Some students were saying that if the remaining requirements could not be achieved, they would strike for a long time, but several fourth-year students who were about to graduate told reporters that they hoped to resolve the issue as soon as possible. The reporter went to President Wu Baofeng's private residence, intending to ask how to deal with the students continuing to strike.

### Expedite Track Repair, Full Traffic Restored

Trains from Beijing to Shanghai that had departed from the previous afternoon to yesterday morning continued to run as usual, terminating at Nanxiang Station, where the Railway Bureau dispatched passenger cars to transport passengers to Shanghai. During this period, trains on the Shanghai-Hangzhou line, both up and down, terminated at these two stations.

### Old Woman Arrested for Arson

[Our Dispatch] Zhu, residing at 497 Minguo Road, suddenly smelled a strong odor of kerosene at approximately 12:15 AM on April 3rd while asleep. She woke up to investigate and found a pile of newspapers soaked in kerosene burning at the back door. She immediately took steps to extinguish the fire. Suspecting something was amiss, she secretly observed the situation. About an hour later, the smell of kerosene returned, this time seeping in from the front door. Ms. Zhu went out the back door, circled around to the front, and saw an old woman using kerosene-soaked newspapers to set fire to the front door. Ms. Zhu shouted for help while restraining the arsonist. Nearby police officers arrived, took the old woman into custody, and transferred her to the District Attorney's Office on charges of endangering public safety. The court held a preliminary hearing yesterday. The defendant, Ding Yu, 53 years old, from Ningbo, residing at 480 Linsen Middle Road, denied setting the fire. The prosecutor called the defendant's daughter, Ding Fumei, to testify. She stated that she was 16 years old and that her mother had instructed her to buy kerosene, but she knew nothing else. The prosecution also called Yu Tongshan, Zheng Zhiqin, Zhu Yongchang, and Yu Shanbao as witnesses, all of whom testified that Ding Yu had indeed committed the act of arson. The prosecutor determined that the defendant's criminal act had been established, but whether her intent was instigated by someone else or due to other reasons was still under further investigation.

### Ministry of Education Spokesman's Statement Last Night: Handling of Jiaotong University Disturbance; Minister Zhu and Supervisor Chen Returned to Beijing Yesterday

[Our Dispatch from Nanjing, 14th] Minister of Education Zhu Jiahua and Supervisor Chen Dongyuan, having handled the Jiaotong University disturbance in Shanghai, flew back to the capital at 2:30 PM on the 14th. After returning to Beijing, Minister Zhu discussed the matter with Premier Zhang of the Executive Yuan and other relevant personnel. At 10:00 PM, the Ministry of Education spokesman issued the following statement regarding the handling of the Jiaotong University disturbance: This time, the Jiaotong University students made certain requests to the Ministry regarding various administrative issues of the school. Due to not fully understanding the facts, or because of misinformation, there were distortions and misunderstandings, leading to strikes and petitions, gathering at the railway station, and disrupting traffic. Minister Zhu went to Shanghai, earnestly persuaded them, and the matter has been resolved. The demands made by the Jiaotong University students this time are:

Issue of Changing the School Name

(1) Opposition to changing the school name and merging with the College of Management. The Ministry has never considered this proposal. Former President Wu Baofeng publicly clarified this, and Minister Zhu also stated in a letter to Dean Zhong of the College of Management that the various departments of the school should develop in a balanced manner and should not be treated differently.

Issue of Financial Difficulties

(2) Regarding the claim that Jiaotong University's funding should be treated equally with other schools, the Ministry has always valued Jiaotong University's long history and past achievements. Since the restoration, it has made every effort to raise funds and equipment to develop the school. There is absolutely no favoritism. The difficulties felt by the school are common to all schools, and the Ministry is constantly planning and seeking to overcome them.

Issue of Navigation and Marine Engineering Departments

(3) Request to continue running the navigation and marine engineering departments. These two departments are purely technical in nature and not comparable to the departments of ordinary universities. Jiaotong University had a navigation department at the end of the Guangxu era, but when the Wusong Merchant Marine School was established, the department was merged into the Merchant Marine School. This has been the case for more than 30 years. During the Anti-Japanese War, Jiaotong University moved inland to Chongqing, and the Wusong Merchant Marine School also moved to Chongqing at this time. Later, the school was temporarily suspended due to various reasons, so the navigation and marine engineering departments were temporarily entrusted to Jiaotong University to run. After the victory, the Ministry responded to requests from all parties, and the Merchant Marine School moved back to Shanghai, so the two departments were ordered to return to the school to avoid dispersing talent and resources and to take into account the educational system. Regarding the current issue of the two departments, President Wu has repeatedly submitted requests to the Ministry for approval to continue running them, and individual alumni of Jiaotong University have also expressed similar opinions. After repeated discussions, Vice Minister Tian went to the school to discuss the substantive aspects of education in both departments. The Ministry approved the merger of the marine engineering department into the shipbuilding department, renamed the shipbuilding and marine engineering department, which still belongs to the College of Engineering. The navigation department was renamed the maritime management department, which belongs to the College of Management. All of the above issues are within the scope of school administration, and once explained, they are easily resolved. During this trip to Shanghai, Minister Zhu encouraged the students of the school to recognize the times and not to abandon their conscience and abilities through out-of-bounds actions, and not to neglect their studies because of suggestions. Once the truth is clear, the above issues can be satisfactorily resolved. (See page 4)

### Central University Students to Petition Again Today

They have resolved not to resume classes until their demands are met. On the evening of the 14th, the school authorities adopted a method of individual persuasion, with the heads of each department convening talks with students of their respective departments in the hope of encouraging them to resume classes voluntarily. However, the students resolved to implement their original plan on the 15th and petition the Ministry of Education, the Executive Yuan, and the National Government again.

### Improving Skills and Abundant Strength; Zheng Lun Defeats Chen You in First Battle

57 to 38; Visiting Team Gets More and More Courageous

[Our Dispatch] The Zheng Lun basketball team played against Chen You last night at 7:00 PM, winning the first game with a score of 57 to 38. The audience was quite lively. At the beginning of the first half, the visiting team was unfamiliar with the basket, and the ball often turned around the rim without going in, so Chen You showed some prominence. By ten minutes, Zheng Lun had achieved a balanced situation, and after fifteen minutes, they surpassed them. In the first half, they relied only on Cai, Tu, and Yu to score points. In the second half, Zheng Lun became more and more courageous, and the score rose steadily.

Abundant Strength

The visiting team was polite, passed the ball often and quickly. Team captain Cai Zhongqiang's command, Tu Wenlong's rebounding and shooting, and Yu Ruizhang's agility and shooting were the backbone of the team. The team was full of strength, and their calmness in the face of adversity and their composure when they were behind were their strengths.

Two Points Ahead

Chen You presented a flag to Zheng Lun before the game to show their friendship. After the two sides made contact at 7:00 PM, Wang Bingfu missed a free throw, and Zheng Lun's Tu Wenlong and Yu Ruizhang quickly scored three points. Chen You's Wang Bingfu then threw in a ball. The starting lineup for Zheng Lun was Cheng Fei, Cai Zhongqiang, Tu Wenlong, Liu Zhengjun, and Yu Ruizhang. Chen You's lineup was Wang Bingfu, Wang Rongsheng, Zhang Jinwu, He Zeng, and Fu Qixia. After five minutes, Zheng Lun took the lead 7-6. By the time they fought to ten minutes, the score was tied twice at 12-12 and 14-14. Chen You's Shi Jiuquan replaced Zhang Jinxuan, and Yu Ruizhang led Zheng Lun by three points (17-14). Zhang Jinxuan replaced Wang Rongsheng again, and Chen You was 16-18, catching up. The visiting team's Wang Donghuan replaced Cheng Fei, attacking with short passes, and the situation gradually improved. Zheng Lun led by two points at 23-21.

Smooth Sailing

At the start of the second half, there was a melee for three minutes. Zheng Lun's Cai and Tu scored, 29-23. Chen You took another timeout. Wang Bingfu replaced Zhang Jinxuan, and Zheng Lun had smooth sailing, leading by as much as 13 points (36-23) within 12 minutes. During this period, Chen You scored two consecutive goals, seemingly making a comeback. The two sides remained average, and at 48-34, Zheng Lun became more and more courageous, while the opponent sometimes took a "wait-and-see attitude." Although they adjusted their lineup, it was difficult to resist. The last four minutes were 49-34, and the situation was set. As a result, Zheng Lun won the first battle with a score of 57 to 38.

Zheng Lun, Fouls, Chen You, Fouls

Cheng Fei, 10, Wang Bingfu, 16

Cai Zhongqiang, 13, Wang Rongsheng, 31

Tu Wenlong, 122, Zhang Jin, 34

Liu Zhengjun, 22, Shi Jiuquan, 15

Both rules will be implemented from today.

The Simplified Rules for Cotton Yarn and Cloth Shipments to Hankou for Application and Approval are largely the same as the procedures and methods for cotton yarn and cloth shipments to South China, Hebei, and Northeast ports that have already been announced and implemented. Manufacturers applying for the allocation of cotton yarn and cloth to be shipped to Hankou or transferred through Hankou to other ports must apply to the TCC for registration and approval. The deadline for registration applications is within one week for local manufacturers from today and within two weeks for out-of-town manufacturers. The monthly limit for cotton yarn and cloth shipments to Hankou is currently being calculated and will be announced in the coming days.

The Simplified Rules for Cotton Yarn and Cloth Transfers for Certificate Issuance, in addition to cotton yarn and cloth shipped to Hankou, South China, Hebei, and Northeast ports, apply to cotton yarn and cloth transfers to other regions. The main provisions are: (1) No quota is temporarily set; (2) Local industry associations or chambers of commerce will handle the issuance of certificates for cotton yarn and cloth transfers; (3) Local industry associations or chambers of commerce shall submit a summary report of all matters handled at the end of each month; (4) Hand-spun native yarn and cloth are not subject to control. Military cotton yarn and cloth are transferred with a military passport.

April Southbound Limit Determined

The total southbound limit for April is 3,724 bales of cotton yarn and 82,360 bolts of cloth.

[Our Report] The Silk Production and Sales Coordination Committee of the Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of Economic Affairs recently noted that spring silkworms in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces will soon emerge, and according to reports from various regions, this spring's production is expected to be abundant. As a result, various manufacturers who had previously received loans for silk reeling last year have applied for loans for silk reeling this season, totaling over 70 companies.

In order to meet the prescribed eligibility standards, allocate silk quotas, and prepare funding for silk reeling, the committee held its third meeting at the China Silk Corporation yesterday morning at 10:00 AM. Attendees included Tan Xihong, Chu Fucheng, Leng Yuqiu, Ge Jingzhong, Tang Xixiang, Dong Zanyao, He Zhaoheng, Fan Chongshi, Pi Zuoqiong, Chen Junren, Yan Ze'zhi, Ma Jiping, Tao Juru, and over 20 others, chaired by Tan Peihong. Important resolutions were passed as follows:

(1) Standards for eligibility review of loan applicants for the spring season of the 36th year of the Republic, and measures for allocating cocoon quotas. (2) Review of the eligibility of manufacturers applying for loans for cocoon collection. (3) Measures for distributing cooperative dried cocoons. (4) In addition to the originally determined amount, the committee and the Farmers Bank of China urgently telegraphed the Executive Yuan and the Joint Administration of the Four Banks for at least 120 billion yuan in additional funds due to the promising silk harvest.

[Another Report] Ge Jingzhong, General Manager of China Silk Corporation, reported that: (1) Report to the Ministries of Agriculture and Economic Affairs on the progress of recent silk administration work; (2) The allocation of cocoon collection quotas in the eastern region has not been finalized, causing anxiety among cocoon farmers; (3) The number of this year's spring cocoon loans is insufficient, and he plans to present the actual situation to the Joint Administration of the Four Banks and will travel to the capital tonight.

### Rice Allocation for Factories and Schools; Applications Start Today; Market Transactions Are Normal, Rice Prices Slightly Decline

[Our Report] Rice allocation for factories and schools in this city will begin today. Application forms and roster formats can be obtained from the Bureau of Social Affairs or the Bureau of Education. The main points of the allocation measures are: (1) Workers' rice rations will be based on rosters prepared by each factory in conjunction with the factory's labor union. The rosters and applications will be submitted to the Bureau of Social Affairs for approval, after which the factories will be notified to deposit funds at designated banks to obtain rice withdrawal certificates, which will then be used to withdraw rice from the Shanghai Grain General Warehouse of the Ministry of Food. (2) The rice allocation measures for teachers, staff, and boarding students of public and private universities, middle schools, and elementary schools are the same as those for factories. Private middle and elementary schools must be registered with the Bureau of Education.

White Rice Price at 168,000

Wu Kaixian, Director of the Bureau of Social Affairs, told reporters yesterday: The price of rice for this allocation is 168,000 yuan per shi (a unit of dry measure) for white rice and 147,000 yuan per shi for foreign indica rice. The first batch of allocations will mostly be white rice, and later allocations will mostly be foreign indica rice. Applicants cannot specify which type of rice they want. The total monthly rice ration needed for students, teachers, staff, and workers in the city is approximately 200,000 dan (another unit of dry measure). Applications and allocations will be processed simultaneously each month, and there is no set deadline. These allocation measures will be maintained until the new rice harvest, and a decision will be made at that time whether to continue them. The distribution of rations to impoverished households will begin with slum dwellers. Detailed measures are being drafted and will be announced soon.

Indica Rice Sales Are the Most Sluggish

Yesterday, approximately 7,700 shi of goods arrived in the North and South markets, including indica rice from Bengbu and Wuhu. Market transactions were normal, and the prices of both japonica and indica rice in the North and South markets fell uniformly by 5,000 to 10,000 yuan. Indica rice sales were the most sluggish. Baiyuan and Yinyuan also fell by 10,000 yuan. High-quality white japonica rice was priced at 300,000 to 305,000 yuan, medium-quality rice at 295,000 yuan, and lower-quality rice at 285,000 to 290,000 yuan. High-quality Bo rice was priced at 295,000 to 300,000 yuan, medium-quality rice at 290,000 to 295,000 yuan, and lower-quality rice at 285,000 to 290,000 yuan.

### Flour Price Adjustment

[Our Report] Manufacturers and dealers have requested adjustments to the allocation and sales prices of flour, claiming that they are suffering significant losses due to insufficient cost coverage and rising expenses. After review by Mayor Wu, the adjustments will take effect on May 12th, with the new prices as follows:

(1) Flour mill price: 72,000 yuan, commodity tax: 1,000 yuan, stamp tax: 220 yuan, transportation and labor: 800 yuan, profit: 2,980 yuan, retail price: 77,000 yuan.

### New Gasoline Prices Revised

Mobil, Texaco, Asia Asia and other companies in the city have, with the approval of the authorities, adjusted the prices of automotive oil and other fuels, effective immediately. The revised prices for various fuels are as follows: (A) Gasoline: 4,000 yuan per gallon (national currency) for delivery at the Pudong oil depot, and 4,500 yuan per gallon for delivery at city gas stations. (B) Diesel: (1) Light diesel: 650,000 yuan per ton (national currency), medium diesel: 635,000 yuan (national currency), heavy diesel: 620,000 yuan (national currency) (all delivered at the Pudong oil depot). (C) Fuel oil: 550,000 yuan per ton (national currency).

### Fuzhou Yuanhong Lychees Arrive

There is very little Fuzhou Yuanhong lychee in stock on the market. Recently, some have been shipped in by merchants, and the first batch was sampled yesterday. The quality of the goods is good, with small kernels and thick flesh. The asking price is high, and no deals have been made yet.

### Fishing and Salt in Liaodong

— Shenyang, 4th (Airmail) Our Correspondent Zhao Zhan

The Northeast is a land of plenty, and most of China's boundless resources are in the Northeast. Besides its vast mineral deposits, along its six-hundred-mile coastline, there are abundant fisheries and salt production, enough to supplement the people's food and the needs of the chemical industry. Their economic value is extremely precious.

Decline in Fisheries Statistics

I have just returned from Liaodong. According to my investigation, the fishing and salt regions ravaged by war are already decaying and there is little hope for recovery in the near future. Fisheries in particular are declining rapidly. During the enemy puppet period, there was considerable development to meet the needs of the Japanese. Around 1940-1941, the total fish production in the Northeast was about 100,000 tons per year, with marine fish and freshwater fish each accounting for half. Marine fish were mainly produced in Gaiping, and freshwater fish were mainly produced in Damai. According to recent statistics, there are 14,767 fishermen on the Liaodong Peninsula, with 2,992 non-powered sailboats and 3 powered mechanical boats. Fishing methods are also very primitive, using quick hooks, nets, and wind nets, so production is not high. According to statistics from Yingkou alone in 1946: 1,550 fishermen could catch 3.43 million catties of fish in a year. (Except for Dalian, there is not a single fishing port with modern facilities.)

Fishermen Poor for Generations

"A fisherman's family is poor for generations." During the puppet Manchukuo era, fishermen were also subjected to the "shipment" system of plunder. After liberation, because of the incessant warfare, the interests of fishermen were even more damaged in the free seas and markets. The current living standards of ordinary fishermen are below the poverty line. In addition to paying fishing taxes and boat taxes, the fish they catch are sent to the "fish beds" in the market, where they are exploited by fishmongers for double the profit. At the same time, they must also dedicate part of their hard-earned fruits to the elusive "reed forest" heroes. Currently, the safety of fishermen is not guaranteed. The fishing season is from March to November, but during the harsh winter months of the Lunar New Year, fishermen must find a way to catch a kind of fresh, flat fish to give to the boat owner.

Japanese Fishing Boats Sail In

On the sea surface where the morning light is dawning, the sea breeze blows the new fishing light song circulating on the fishermen's lips, which says: Tell MacArthur, we oppose Japanese fishing boats sailing into Chinese waters, we are no longer slaves! We demand that Japan compensate for a large number of fishing boats to compensate for the anemia of fishermen who have been oppressed. As the sun rises from the curtain of deep mist in the east, our bright eyes are watching the Japanese fishing boats.

The Northeast is already facing a salt shortage because production cannot be restored and salt stocks have been exhausted. Salt production in the Northeast reaches 30 million dan, but local needs are only 6 million dan. Two-thirds of the salt is produced in the Far East Peninsula. The largest salt factories are in Yinggai, Fuxian, and Jinzhou. In addition, Zhuanghe, Jinxi, Suifeng, Panshan, and Xingcheng are smaller in scale, and the construction of Suifeng salt is the most modern. Unfortunately, the factory equipment was destroyed by the Communists. The received salt stocks were 970,000 dan for Yinggai Factory, 2.6 million dan for Fuxian Factory, and about 1 million dan for Jinxi, Zhuanghe, Suifeng, Panshan, Xingcheng, etc. After one year, the salt stocks have been used up, and the factories cannot restore production, so salt has become a serious problem.

Electricity Shortage Affects Production

Taking Yinggai as an example, the annual production during the puppet era was 150,000 tons, but this year's production will hardly reach 70,000 tons. This salt factory is located at the mouth of the Liao River to Gaiping, a length of 70 li. The area of the official and merchant salt fields is 1,612 fu (each fu equals 1.5 hectares), and the degree of damage reaches 80%. Complete restoration requires 850 million circulation notes and cannot be restored in the short term. The electrical equipment has been completely destroyed. Currently, it is only possible to use the tide trapped in the salt fields to make salt, so the output is naturally small.

High Grain Prices Affect Treatment

The lives of salt workers are even more impoverished. Their treatment is difficult to sustain even themselves, let alone their wives and children. The monthly salary for foremen is 9,500 yuan, 9,000 yuan for spinners, 8,500 yuan for strikers, and 8,000 yuan for salt workers. The price of sorghum rice in Yinggai is 120 yuan per catty, so with such a pitiful salary, one can only buy 67 catties of sorghum rice per month. According to Mr. Yang Shilin, director of the Yinggai Salt Factory, "We are trying our best to find ways to improve the treatment of salt workers, but there are many difficulties. We are thinking of providing workers with supplies in kind. If we can achieve this, each worker can receive 250 catties of sorghum rice per month." Amidst soaring grain prices, the most urgent need in the salt region is rice.

### Social Aspects of Fuzhou

— Fuzhou, 3rd (Airmail) Our Special Correspondent Chen Zhengyu

For nearly half a month, persistent heavy rain has made the usually quiet city of Fuzhou appear even more simple and pale. Pedestrians are sparse. Sima Qian wrote "Chongqing Guest" to describe the streets of Chongqing in the rain, full of "mushrooms." In rainy Fuzhou, it is hard to see one or two people wearing raincoats among ten people. Most of them are carrying the famous Fuzhou-made umbrellas, and are the streets not full of "special products"?

In the past, there was a long drought with no rain, and rice prices soared. However, after half a month of heavy rain, rice prices are still rising. Rice merchants say that the mountain streams have flooded, and rice boats from northern Fujian cannot travel downstream, so the source is lacking. This has also become an excuse for high rice prices. Ordinary people cannot help but sigh!

High Rice Prices Lead to Affordable Meals

The Fuzhou City Party Headquarters recently partnered with the Fujian Office of the Executive Yuan's Relief and Rehabilitation Administration to open an affordable canteen. This is indeed a blessing in a place without a "set meal" system. It provides 1,000 meals per day, each costing 1,000 yuan, with one vegetable dish, one soup, and ten taels of white rice. Amidst the soaring prices, this is cheap. The canteen is crowded with customers every day, mostly junior civil servants, students, and laborers. They line up to buy tickets and take their seats. Those who arrive late often regret their lateness. In this gap, we can see the difficulty of life for the average person in Fuzhou.

People in Fuzhou have the elegant hobby of strolling on "South Street." At night, the streets are bustling, but unfortunately, there has been a power outage recently, and it is dark and dim. Recently, the weather has been clear with a bright moon, and citizens stroll the streets by moonlight, which is quite interesting. The Fuzhou City Police Bureau has asked each Baojia to hang oil lamps at night to maintain night security in order to prevent small-scale activities.

A Bomb Scare Alarms Officials

A construction worker in the provincial government recently discovered a buried bomb while digging soil to repair a corridor. Chaos erupted instantly, alarming officials in the government, and employees fled. The bomb was about fifteen centimeters square, and the casing was heavily rusted, as if it had been buried for a long time. Where did this bomb come from? Some said it was buried by the enemy when they left, and some said it was a bomb dropped by enemy planes during the war that did not explode. There were many rumors. Later, the Security Command sent engineers to excavate and found that it was actually a large piece of bomb shrapnel buried in the ground, causing a false alarm and also a small amusing incident.

Summer is Approaching, Garbage is a Concern

Fuzhou City does not have a tap water system, which has created many problems. The recent epidemics are mainly due to citizens drinking unclean well water, and fires are often severely disastrous due to the limited water source. Even as summer approaches and citizens' water consumption increases, some areas have wells that have dried up. It is strange that a city located by the sea has come to fear water. Recently, some people in Fuzhou City have paid attention to the garbage problem, because garbage piles up everywhere, emitting a foul odor, which has a negative impact on the health of citizens. Fuzhou newspapers questioned where the more than 300 sanitation workers of the municipal government have gone. If this continues, will this garden city not become a garbage city? However, the ancient site of Minglun Hall has indeed become a garbage dump. Nearby schools and residents have protested. It is said that students at the nearby Central Elementary School have contracted meningitis, which is related to the garbage.

Huaqing Hot Springs Offer Bathing in the Spring Cold

Fuzhou is a city of hot springs. Starting from Tangbian Township in the northeast of the city and moving southeast to the vicinity of Wangzhuang, the area stretches for more than 10,000 feet. The vastness of the area is the greatest in the southeastern provinces. The northeast gate of Fuzhou is called Tangmen, which is named after the hot springs. In the Tangmen area, wells are dug, and spring water flows out in abundance. Bathhouses stand in rows. "Huaqing Hot Springs, bath bestowed in the spring cold" has been a beautiful story for thousands of years. People from other places who come to Fuzhou for the first time all express envy for the convenience and comfort of bathing in Fuzhou. Fuzhou's bathhouses serve the same function as Sichuan's teahouses: resolving lawsuits, chatting to relieve worries, the bathhouse is a great place to go. The hot springs contain sulfur and have an average temperature of more than 60 degrees Celsius, which has the ability to kill bacteria and can treat skin diseases.

Please Crack Down on Black Market Ticket Scalpers at the Station

Editor: I am a rickshaw puller. At first, the two of us who pulled the rickshaw could make a living. Unexpectedly, not only is rice expensive, but black market ticket scalpers are also very active inside the train station (black market ticket scalpers are another name for rickshaw and handcart touts). There are forty to fifty black market ticket scalpers at the North Station in this city. When a train arrives in Shanghai and passengers disembark, they ask passengers to solicit those willing to ride, and then they negotiate the fare. They profit from it. For example, if a passenger is willing to pay 10,000 yuan for a ride, the black market ticket scalper will introduce the customer to us, and we only get 4,000 to 5,000 yuan. The rest goes into the black market ticket scalper's pocket. Passengers who are not seasoned travelers are often defrauded by them, either by paying more for the fare or by losing their luggage. Rickshaw pullers are not allowed to enter the train station because the first police don't allow it, and the second they sneak in to pick up passengers, the rickshaws are placed outside and are often damaged or the tires are punctured (this is called injecting medicine), which is clearly a trick of the black market ticket scalpers. We hope that the railway authorities and the municipal police agencies will severely crack down on these black market ticket scalpers to avoid adding another layer of exploitation to our hard-working rickshaw pullers.

### After Reading "Words on the Human World"

— Li Baifeng

Mr. Wang Jing'an of Haining, his ci (a type of Chinese poetry) style is elegant, his poetry is clear and unique, he is learned and eloquent, and his name is known throughout the world. His scholarship in ci poetry is equal to that of San Yuan the Elder, and his skill in textual analysis is comparable to that of Mr. Tai Yan, worthy of being passed down through generations. It is a pity that due to national difficulties and family sorrows, he threw himself into Kunming Pool. Such a talented man became a Chu minister. His plight under Luo Zhenyu also shows that his noble character is difficult to be swayed by worldly customs. His book "Words on the Human World" is highly regarded in the world of ci poetry because, as Yu Pingbo said, "One must be in the midst of the game to know the joys and sorrows; one must also be outside the game to have a fair judgment." Therefore, he is able to enter deeply and see the true face, gaining respect in the realm of ci poetry. He states clearly in the introduction:

"Ci poetry values realm above all else. With realm, it naturally forms a high style and famous lines. This is why the ci poetry of the Five Dynasties and Northern Song Dynasty is uniquely excellent."

People often value Bai Shi and Mei Cheng, but they do not know that Bai Shi's "swallows lightly dance, orioles sweetly sing" has a feminine air. Its fragrance, compared to Fei Qing's "screen with golden partridges," precisely hits the mark: "delicate clouds piled on pillows, hairpins placed sideways, melted spring water, willow catkin dreams." Duan Ji's "the person by the stove is like the moon, her white wrist like frozen snow…" appears petty in comparison. Even his two poems "Secret Fragrance" and "Sparse Shadow" have the appearance of small still life paintings, not as majestic and dignified as the Grand Master's large oil portrait.

"The realm of 'no self' can only be attained in stillness; the realm of 'self' can only be attained in the stillness within movement. Therefore, one is beautiful, and the other is magnificent."

Jing'an's words can only be spoken by those who deeply understand the joys and sorrows within. Only by forgetting the self can we avoid forcing harmony with nature, and instead feel joy and be intimately connected with heaven and earth. However, the realm of "no self" also has levels of high and low. "Picking chrysanthemums by the eastern fence, leisurely seeing the Southern Mountains" and "The music ends, but the person is gone, only several green peaks remain above the river" are of the highest quality. "Cold waves faintly rise, white birds leisurely descend" and "Fine rain, fish come out, gentle breeze, swallows fly diagonally" are of medium quality. Why? Because the former ten characters do not deliberately create a phenomenon, truly seamless. Its high quality lies in truly desiring to speak of the Way and then speaking of it. Although "cold waves, white birds" are praised for their rising and appearing, and "fish, swallows" are praised for their coming out and flying diagonally, they are all intentionally done. Sima Biao, the Sage of Writing, said, "Without using a single word, one can attain elegance," which originally lies in using words without being attached to skillfulness, and skillfulness naturally appears. "Several green peaks bitterly, scattered twilight words…" although derived from "Several green peaks remain above the river," when compared, the difference is clear. As for Xie Tiao's "Clear river is as still as silk," when Li Bai continued it with "Loving the way, the clear river is as still as silk, it makes people often remember Xie Xuanhui," it feels like adding feet to a snake. Therefore, those with high style cannot be added to or subtracted from. For example, Yong Shu added to Zhu Qingyu's: "After making up, she lowers her voice and asks her husband, 'Is my painted eyebrow fashionable?'" with:

"Phoenix hairpins with golden mud, dragon-patterned jade palm combs; going back and forth, laughing with fans covering their faces, asking, 'Is my painted eyebrow fashionable?' Playing with the brush, scaring people for a long time, first trying her hand at painting flowers; casually preventing embroidered work, laughing and asking, 'How do you write the two characters for mandarin duck?'"

The former is delicate and affectionate, but the change makes it a bit "sultry."

"Tearful eyes ask flowers, flowers do not speak, scattered reds fly past the swing" and "Holding hands, looking at each other with tearful eyes, finally speechless, choking with sobs…" both have the realm of "self," but the loneliness and wistfulness of tearful eyes asking flowers and flowers flying away cannot be imitated by Liu Qi's ci poetry. In common parlance, Liu Qi is clear and understandable, approachable. Therefore, "where there is well water, there is song of Liu Qi's ci poetry." In terms of ci poetry quality, Yong Guan's ci poetry is innocent and untainted, clearly understanding in the heart. Therefore, there are high-quality works within the realm of "self," and there are also high-quality works within the realm of "no self." As for "Green willow shadows reveal the swing," "Red apricot branches are full of spring…" the wording is stable and lovely, but when compared to innocence, it is inferior.

### Discussing "Science for the Masses"

— Yu Jianguang

A Kind of Popular Science Reading Material Rooted in China

World science is advancing with great strides. What about Chinese science? Generally speaking, the situation is quite bleak. Speaking solely in terms of academics, existing academic institutions are all clinging to the old and unwilling to change. There is no need to talk about the revitalization of the academic atmosphere. From the May Fourth Movement to today, science is still the exclusive domain of a small number of "scholars." The transmission of science mainly relies on writing. The general public cannot even read characters, let alone understand newspapers. How can we talk about understanding science and learning science? Moreover, the spread of science has always been limited to a few cities, targeting students. As a result, in places like Shanghai, there are still people who seek gods and ask for fortunes when they are sick, not to mention other more impoverished and remote areas. However, can you say that the Chinese people do not need science? That is not the case. The Chinese people not only need science to enrich their way of life and improve their production technology, but scientific methods and training also help them in their thinking and behavior. In my personal opinion, China currently allows for the establishment of atomic energy research institutes and mathematical research centers to showcase the country's honor, but popularizing scientific knowledge to the masses across the country and making science accessible to the public is more urgent and beneficial for us.

Scientific Writing Urgently Needs Attention

Based on this understanding, I would like to discuss the recently published monthly magazine "Science for the Masses." This magazine has only published seven issues so far, but it has already attracted considerable attention in the reading community, the scientific community, and the business community. It is said to be a fast-selling publication on Wangping Street. It is fortunate that popular science publications can sell well, indicating an increasing public interest in science. However, we cannot ignore the fact that the style of "Science for the Masses" is more closely aligned with popularization as an important factor. Reading "Science for the Masses," few people will not appreciate the fluency of the articles inside, with many small subtitles that are easy to memorize. Many people often feel that science is profound, but rather than saying that science is profound, it would be better to say that general scientific writing is difficult to understand. Chinese people who study science must read books. Initially, only foreign books were available. Gradually, Chinese science books emerged, but because most of the scientists who wrote them did not pay attention to writing, those who understood English still habitually read English books, while those who did not understand English still had no way to enter the hall of science. Chinese people either do not want science, or if they want science, they must have their own scientific books in their own language, and this language must not be stiff or stagnant. Whether the writing in "Science for the Masses" can serve as a model for future scientific writing still needs to be carefully examined. Generally speaking, its writing is as simple and fluent as ordinary comprehensive publications.

Secondly, I think that the large-scale use of illustrations in "Science for the Masses" is commendable. Today's characters originally evolved from images, and there are many places where words cannot explain clearly, but a picture can explain clearly. Objectively studying the interests of the general public, pictures are more attractive than words. For example, the April issue of "Science for the Masses" has a report on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, with a plan of the entire line attached. I think that people in the Jiangsu and Zhejiang areas, even if they can count the names of each station on the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines, few people probably know how this third major road goes. This picture is very effective in introducing the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway. The magazine pays great attention to the collection of pictures. The Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration and the news offices of several embassies regularly provide them with materials and photos, which is a very meaningful cooperation.

Introducing the Domestic Construction Situation

Flipping through "Science for the Masses," I feel that they seem to be working in two directions in parallel, namely, "introducing the domestic construction situation and expounding on the progress of world science." In terms of world science, the magazine's February issue (actually sold at the end of January), "World Science in 1946" special issue, can be taken as a representative. In a small space, it introduced the achievements of world science in the past year, industrial products, and the Nobel Prize winners in physics, chemistry, and medicine and health. Regardless of the time saved or the way of expression, it is very appropriate. The introduction of the domestic construction situation, "Science for the Masses," has maintained from the first issue to the present. The April issue is an introduction to Fushun. A friend who is engaged in international cultural exchange talked to me and said that foreign science magazines are often sent, but it is rare to have a few types of Chinese science magazines that can be taken out. Why? The entire book is translated from foreign countries and sent to foreign countries. Are you asking them to translate it back? "Science for the Masses" also inevitably suffers from this problem. It also has many articles taken from foreign magazines, but the first one or two articles in each issue, if taken out, are also something, their own materials, their own photos, may wish to introduce to foreign friends. Articles like this should only be too few, not too many.

Long Serializations are Not Very Suitable

"Science for the Masses" devotes a considerable amount of space to articles on medicine and physiology. Recently, it has also added a column, "Public Medicine and Health Consultant," which may be because they are focusing on the health and conservation of the nation. Several basic science lectures are very suitable for science teaching materials in secondary schools, but appearing once a month may take too long. "Wandering in the Wonders of Science" is not very new and is not a very suitable long serialization. In addition, there are fewer articles on pure science than articles on applied science, and there are no articles on agriculture. Chinese scientists who are working hard in these disciplines seem to be able to give them a little help.

"Science for the Masses" is a magazine that still inevitably uses text as a technique. The requirement of popularizing science is that the closer it is to the masses, the more ideal it is. Through its text, illustrations, and price, it can be considered to be approaching the road of popularization in comparison. However, in today's China, I am afraid that only young people have the ability and habit of reading. How many copies can reach the hands of the real masses, and what fraction can be absorbed and adopted by them? In undertaking the work of popularizing science, can "Science for the Masses" be satisfied with its current work? This is worth thinking deeply and deliberating on by the magazine and scientists across the country.

### Fundamentals of World Geography (Written by Chen Yuan, Jian Guo Bookstore Edition)

— Na Ya

In today's world where geographical reading materials are very scarce—although there are still a few books on geography, generally speaking, it is scarce. Now, the several geography works in the Jian Guo Middle School Student Reading Series, with their popular and accurate content, are indeed works that relieve the famine of scarcity. Among them, Chen Yuan's book, "Fundamentals of World Geography," has the best content.

The form of this book is very lively, but the content is very rich. It does not have the rigid fixed principles of ordinary geography works, which make readers feel bored and have headaches. Instead, it naturally explains the geographical foundations of the world: including land, people, climate, transportation, and resources. Although each department is explained briefly, it is very clear. Indeed, this book is better than the author's other book, "Tales of Regular World Geography."

The author's handling of this work is very lively and interesting. He starts by mentioning the world of water, and first interestingly says: "If the ocean were to dry up one day, what do you think would happen?" Then, he explains the problem one by one, and also describes the importance of the ocean and the distribution of the ocean, the five major oceans, rivers, famous rivers, canals, lakes, etc., all based on the latest materials, and clearly stated.

Geographical works were originally very dull, but the author adopted a new and lively way of writing, so that readers not only do not feel dull, but only feel fresh, lively, and readable. This method can be said to be a great success.

The author then continues to explain the geography of terrain, continents, climate, humans, transportation, and crops, the geography of power resources, and the geography of metal and non-metal resources in the same way. In each of the above departments, the author divided many sections to fully describe them.

### Review of "Guidance for Studying in the United States"

— Li Xuezhong

Compiled by Liu Zhihong, published by Commercial Press

Our country has had students studying in the United States since the late Qing Dynasty, so the time cannot be considered late. The number of people who have completed their studies and returned to the country is unknown, but there is little introduction to the situation of American universities to the Chinese people. In the past, it can be said that there were no dedicated authors. Our country's embassies and consulates abroad are all busy with international negotiations, overseas Chinese issues, and commercial matters, so they have no time to investigate the internal affairs of universities in various countries. Therefore, although students in domestic universities are eager to know the situation of American universities, they have no way to obtain it, and those who want to study in the United States feel even more depressed. Because they know almost nothing about the situation of American schools, they often make mistakes in applying to schools.

Mr. Liu Zhihong, a former professor at Northeastern University, based on his personal experience and the results of his observations in the United States, compiled the book "Guidance for Studying in the United States," which is about 100,000 words. The book describes everything from preparing for departure procedures to completing studies and returning to the country. It covers almost all the matters that American students want to know.

The main parts of this book are the general overview of American institutions of higher learning, the analysis of university departments, and the general discussion of research institutes in three chapters. In these three chapters, the organization of American universities, the advantages and disadvantages of each school and department, and the examination methods for doctoral and master's degrees are all described in great detail. In addition, there are also special chapters detailing all aspects of clothing, food, housing, transportation, American university student life, and British and American customs during the stay in the United States. Therefore, those who intend to study in the United States really need to read this book.

### Waves Washing Sand

— Maple Leaf

Written by Shu Yan, published by Wan Ye Bookstore

China, which has suffered many disasters, is now encountering a fate similar to that of fifty years ago. That was the time when the Sino-Japanese War was defeated, prompting the Reform Movement of 1898, and new forces and old trends were launching a head-on collision; soon after, the Boxer Rebellion plunged the entire country into a precarious state. Today, although the War of Resistance has been won, the chaotic domestic situation has prevented the national construction plan, which is related to the fate of hundreds of millions of people, from proceeding smoothly. Therefore, the critical moment of "survival or extinction" is once again placed before the Chinese people!

Those who are aware of this crisis will certainly not remain silent. In Mr. Shu Yan's Waves Washing Sand, he tells us a story from fifty years ago, while also making us feel the shadow of today's China.

Waves Washing Sand is a recently published play. The story takes place in the home of Xia Yongqing, a former Left Deputy Censor of the Qing Dynasty. The stubborn, stubborn, arrogant, and conservative "important minister," filled with "ethical principles" and "Confucian morality," cannot hold back the new generation awakened by the tides of the times. His eldest son, Xia Duosheng, is very close to Tan Sitong, one of the "Six Gentlemen"; the second son, Duomin, has accepted the baptism of the Father of the Nation's Revive China Society.

The Sino-Japanese War was defeated. Young people were stimulated. Just as the "heavily responsible frontier envoys" were singing and dancing, they were also lamenting "the declining morals of the people." "Reform" was implemented under the leadership of Kang Youwei and Liang Qichao. The edict of "change the law" shattered the dreams of "red-capped and peacock-feathered" officials. During this period, Xia Duosheng was also playing a key role. His younger brother, although not taking action, was actively working.

However, history proved that Kang and Liang's route was not correct. Relying on the four-character magic formula of "delaying and postponing" and insidious and vicious means, the "ministers" united under the "common suffering" of everyone being in danger, and finally caused the "Reform Movement of 1898." Xia Duosheng fell out with his father; and after the death of the "Six Gentlemen," he left. The stubborn conservatives won a complete victory, and politics became even worse. Even under the support of the "court," the "Boxers" were produced, leading to the disaster of the "Eight-Nation Alliance."

Not submerged by "reform," he was finally overwhelmed by "foreign troubles." Xia Yongqing, the old official who was "implicated" by his son and dismissed from office, could only escape to the Shanghai Concession after the capital was moved west and the capital city fell, to live a life of "enjoying his old age." Duomin continued his work in Shanghai. Duosheng also changed his previous wrong policy and joined the Revive China Society to work for the British life. At this time, Xia Yongqing suffered a stroke and died, and the whole play ended here.

With such a serious story as the theme, threading in many "aristocratic" family lives and relationships, the overall plot of the play is still very compact and impeccable. The freshness and fluency of the words, of course, need not be said.

Especially in writing techniques, the "symbolic method" is constantly applied from beginning to end, and it achieves the effect of "inspiring deep thought." The whole description is vivid and the powerful ending is like thunder… In every way, it makes people feel that this is a good book worth recommending.

According to the author's statement in the foreword, there is a sequel to this Waves Washing Sand. "Drunken Peace" is about the era from the success of the revolution to the Great Revolution of 1927; Ode to Revival is a side view of the days from the September 18 Incident to the victory of the War of Resistance. However, we believe that judging from this play alone, it is enough to be a mirror of China today.

Using the author's own words to clarify the significance of this play is "to write about the suffering, resistance, and revival of the Chinese nation in the past half century from the story of a family of officials." In fact, I believe that the author hopes to point out the crisis of a part of the nation.

Today's China has already reached the edge of the misfortune of fifty years ago. Everyone must deeply consider and reflect on whether they have taken the wrong path? Has it exploited the name of "democracy" for their own benefit, thereby endangering the country and the nation? This book provides such a question:——"The road is to be walked by people, only that) way can be successful." So? Have you gone astray?

### After Reading "The Life Calendar of the Chinese People"

— Pan Gen

(Compiled by Chen Guo and Qiu Peihao, published by Zheng Zhong Bookstore)

The Literature Records of the Han Book states: Before the Han Dynasty in our country, there were already six calendars of the Yellow Emperor, Zhuanxu, Xia, Yin, Zhou, and Xi. The origins of the calendar are ancient and important.

China is based on agriculture, and the chronology of the year is based on the order of autumn harvest and winter storage. The so-called "not missing the farming season" is the foundation of government and education. However, since the establishment of the autocratic regime, it has been the practice to determine the first month of the year, and therefore, the books recording the regulations and ordinances have flourished. The Book of Rites and the chapters on rites and music in the historical books of past dynasties belong to this category; since the theory of prophecies and weft books prevailed, they were used for divination and predicting good and bad fortune. Therefore, the theory of the ten celestial stems and twelve terrestrial branches and the five elements prevailed, and the divination works attributed to Dongfang Shuo and the books on astrology of later generations belong to this category. As for the customs of the common people, there are not many specialized works that can reveal the gains and losses of a generation's political affairs. If there are any, they originated from Customs and Throughs, and the Annual Records of Jingchu began to make records in the order of years and months. However, they are either limited to one time or only record one place, and are all records left over from the pens of literati, and works of leisure. Others are scattered throughout the books, and the authors are like Records of the Origins of Things, Records of Customs, Old Events in Wulin, and various local chronicles. Also, for example, the wrestling drama reached its peak in the Han Dynasty, and its system is briefly seen in the Biography of Li Si in the Records of the Grand Historian, the Annals of Emperor Wu of the Han Book, the annotations to the Two Capitals Rhapsody in the Selections of Refined Literature, and the Records of the Buddhist Monasteries of Luoyang by Yang Xuanzhi. If it were not for extensive citations and quotations, its details would not be available. The matter of arranging and organizing these materials could not be accomplished overnight.

Now, reading "The Life Calendar of the Chinese People" co-authored by Mr. Chen and Mr. Qiu, even the slightest sigh or chant, if it is related to customs, is recorded without omission. The summary is concise and comprehensive, forming a great national work; and the use of ancient examples for the present is beneficial to politics and education. The culture of the ancient country of the East is clearly visible here. It is indeed appropriate to promote it overseas, with one copy for everyone. According to the authors' preface, this book took ten years to compile, and was revised many times. The depth of their intention and the diligence of their efforts can be seen.

### Making Cigarettes with Horse Manure

— Ji Gan

Japan is truly a country that is good at making substitutes. Recently, due to the small number of cigarettes being rationed, some people have come up with a whimsical idea and invented a new product, the tobacco of which is made from horse manure that has been cut and pieced together using special methods. It is said that after analyzing this type of cigarette, its taste is not as pungent as expected. Therefore, buyers are rushing to buy it, and its sales are extremely wide, threatening ordinary cigarette merchants.

Using smelly horse manure to make cigarettes is really an irony in the eyes of us Chinese, who have always called them "fragrant cigarettes." However, due to the lack of supply, they can even put horse manure in their mouths and eat it in their stomachs. This shows the extent to which a person with a craving for cigarettes can eat anything to satisfy their hunger.

The Japanese are good at making substitutes. At the same time, Japanese goods, compared with the goods of other countries, are also a kind of substitute. We have called Japanese goods inferior goods in the past, and there is a reason for this. However, these inferior substitutes were once a threat to domestic goods and Western goods. The common people are not unpatriotic. The eight years of the War of Resistance are ironclad proof. However, when it comes to boycotting inferior goods, there is a bit of shame. The reason for this is the same as the Japanese's love of smoking cigarettes made from horse manure.

Among goods, there are substitutes. There are also substitutes for everything else, including people. When a student cannot rely on his usual hard work to cope with an exam, he uses cramming to replace it; if cramming is not enough to cope, honest people turn in blank papers, and dishonest people use cheating to replace it. When cheating becomes a last resort, it is really a dead end for that person. Furthermore, taking this cheating student as an example. He himself sometimes becomes a substitute in a class. When the number of people in a class who can pass the exam and advance or graduate is too small, the cheating students rise up to fill the quota and get by.

It can be seen that the appearance of substitutes is always due to the lack of supplies. After the appearance of substitutes, the original goods feel threatened. If we magnify the scope of substitutes tens of thousands of times, we can see how many substitutes are produced today and how great the threat felt by the original goods. We thoroughly hate the appearance of substitutes, but the solution to the problem still depends on the efforts of the original goods themselves.

### Ticket Refund Issues

— Wu Derun

In the commercially prosperous Shanghai, if all daily transactions were conducted solely with cash, it would necessitate "requesting" the issuance of several more million-yuan and ten-million-yuan bills to ensure "ease of use." Therefore, currently, larger transactions are mostly settled with checks. For familiar clients and reputable businesses, a check is no different from cash, and it's even more convenient. However, when encountering a first-time transaction or when there's not complete trust in the other party, the recipient of the check feels uneasy. The reason for this unease, of course, is the worry about the check being returned.

The main reason for a returned check is, naturally, insufficient funds in the account, with the check amount exceeding the deposit. However, to protect the client's reputation, banks often conceal "insufficient funds" and falsely claim "uncleared funds" to deceive the "bearer." Some banks even use "please contact the drawer" or "please present again" as reasons for the return, which truly confuses the "bearer" and leaves them baffled. Therefore, I advocate that banks and money shops should not use vague terms when explaining the reason for a returned check but should provide a detailed explanation to the bearer. If the deposit is "sufficient" or "insufficient," they should state it directly, avoiding putting the bearer in a difficult position. (If the funds are not received and the check is returned to the drawer, then the reason for the return, "please present again," seems unreasonable.)

Especially in the current market situation, which changes rapidly, coupled with high interest rates on debts, if one sells goods and receives a bad check, the loss is significant. Moreover, if the check is endorsed or deposited into a money shop and then returned, it affects the person's reputation. Therefore, we believe that those who issue bad checks should bear unforgivable legal responsibility. Although current court rulings on lawsuits involving bad checks order repayment, these rulings seem lenient. Compensation should also be awarded for the mental distress suffered by the bearer. Not long ago, the "Silver Money Association" issued a notice to various money shops, stating that any client who issues a bad check more than three times will have their account closed and their checkbook confiscated. This is an excellent measure, and it is hoped that all banks will implement it to deter the misuse of checks and indirectly reduce many disputes in society, thereby maintaining financial integrity.

### George Bernard Shaw and Vivien Leigh

— Man

Frank Harris wrote in his biography of George Bernard Shaw, "He (Shaw) said that when he had leisure, he would rewrite Hamlet one day, and he would write it in such a way as to reveal the true meaning of Hamlet."

From this statement, we can see Shaw's humor. Humor is not merely jesting; it contains a serious meaning. Shaw was radical in many aspects, from philosophy to politics, and his humor often tore away the outer garments of contradictions, exposing the truth nakedly.

Shaw differed from other thinkers; his followers were widespread across all social classes, but like Shakespeare, his works were read by a wide range of readers. Shaw was not just a thinker because, if he were only a thinker, he would not be able to deeply move the emotions of his readers. His play "Caesar and Cleopatra," which depicts the story between Cleopatra and Caesar, is one of his best historical comedies.

Shaw was born in Ireland on July 26, 1856, and is still alive today. His vegetarianism keeps him very healthy. During the filming of the movie, he often went to the studio to chat with Vivien Leigh, teaching her how to play the role, which shows how much Shaw valued this script.

### Love Songs of Tibetan Compatriots

— Li Puyuan

The annual Sutra Display Ceremony at Kumbum Monastery is approaching. Tibetan, Hui, and Mongolian men and women are converging from all over the grasslands, mountains, tents, and earthen houses, like rivers flowing into the sea, at Lusar (Wenhua Town). Among them are chieftains, nobles, and ordinary people. Especially the women, each according to their own ethnic customs, wear their most gorgeous and beautiful clothes, bring their best ornaments, and their only silver coins, preparing to spend a dozen pleasant days here.

Almost ten days before the Sutra Display Ceremony, the small mountain opposite Wenhua Town, half of which is occupied by the temple, is covered with green grass, dotted with many scattered willows. White tents, like small piles of snow, are pitched up, some closer, some more distant. In front and behind them, women in bright red, green, and purple clothes, their braids, tassels, and ribbons swaying in the warm breeze, flutter around like the powdery wings of butterflies. The sun is bright, and the silver, jade, and coral ornaments in front and behind them sparkle like stars in the sunlight.

In any place nearby, anyone with a bottle of wine can gather a group of compatriots of both sexes within a few minutes. Immediately, a plaintive, soaring, and sharp song rises, swaying back and forth. People form a circle, one or two zhang in diameter, becoming thicker and thicker. In the middle are the love song singers, and around them are the audience. The love song singers are in pairs, some older, probably experienced singers, and some younger, said to be novices in the realm of love.

The melody of the love songs is generally the same, but the singers can express changes in emotion by stretching or raising certain sounds. What particularly reveals their poetic talent is that the lyrics of the love songs are improvised, instantly drawing from what the singer sees, hears, and thinks, without any hesitation. Moreover, the opponent sings first, and you have to continue from their lyrics, which is not easy. However, our seemingly rough and simple Tibetan compatriots can handle it fluently and naturally in nine out of ten cases!

The song is accompanied by dance, and there is absolutely no rigid or awkward love song singing. The rule is: the first person to sing, holding the wine bottle while singing and dancing, has the right to hand the bottle to the person they fancy at the end of a verse. The person who receives the bottle must immediately continue singing. If someone in the audience fancies the singer, they can immediately take over at the end of the last word of the song, and then the person being taken over must hand the bottle to you—often, because many people sing and harmonize well, they immediately run out of the circle together to enjoy their joyful fate, regardless of how many people are watching!

### Notes on Appreciating Kunqu Opera

— Listener

Kunqu opera originated with Wei Liangfu in the Ming Dynasty, flourished in the early Qing Dynasty, and declined after the Jiaqing and Daoguang periods. The Shenbao newspaper is committed to promoting it, and on the evening of the fourth of this month, it was broadcast on the Oriental Radio Station. The first excerpt was "Demolishing the Book" from "Matching at the Western Tower," with Mr. Yin Zhenxian as Zhao Bojiang and Miss Liu Hutu as Yu Shuye. Mr. Yin comes from a Kunshan family and is a renowned doctor. His singing has always been praised by Mr. Yu Lianju (the father of Yu Zhenfei), known for his "jiao cu," "shi," and "jiao," and is called "Gu Qiao Yin" by opera aficionados. Miss Liu is his disciple, and her singing of the "Yi Lan Shan..." section of "Yi Jiang Feng" is accurate and relaxed. The "Hong Na Ao" section, "Kan Ta Can Lan Ying..." is extremely difficult to sing, reaching high into the clouds and low into the sea; without considerable skill, how dare one attempt it? Her dialogue is always consistent with the plot. The verbal sparring between Yu Shuye and Zhao Bojiang is exceptionally brilliant, the questions and answers are tight, and it's seamless, worthy of inheriting the mantle of Gu Qiao Yin. Particularly admirable is that the four tones are accurate, with proper intonation, just like her teacher. After "Demolishing the Book," Mr. Zhu Yaowen and Ms. Shen Zhuoru followed with the "Monopoly" from "Occupying the Flower Kui," both singing and dialogue were very skilled, another wonderful excerpt. Mr. Ye Xiaohong sang the "Xu Ge" from "The Palace of Eternal Life," the "Xi Qian Ying" scattered aria "Xiu De Ba..." seemed too short; the audience did not fully enjoy it. Mr. Ye is also an old opera singer, his temples are already frosted, yet he can still sing, truly commendable. Mr. Zhou Exuan sang the "Jing Bian" from "The Palace of Eternal Life," the "Shiliuhua" "Bu Lao Ni..." his voice is broad and grand, very fitting for the identity of the emperor, with unique subtleties and different from the ordinary. It is said that Mr. Zhou is also a top student of Yin's, most admirable. For future performances, if musical instruments such as sheng, pipes, and pipa could be added to coordinate with the dizi flute, it would be even more outstanding. With national music like this, why seek it in foreign lands?!

### The Beautiful Fire

— Hua

Miss A: I heard your brother was fired from the fire department.

Miss B: Yes—it's because of his poor eyesight.

Miss A: How so?

Miss B: He spent half the day spraying water from the hose, only to find out it wasn't a fire, but a red-haired foreign woman.

### Casual Talk While Alone

— Wang Cong

"Why are people afraid of death?"

This seems like a simple and laughable question, however, upon careful thought, it is just like the question of why apples fall to the ground, and it is not unworthy of pondering by us, who pride ourselves as the beings of all creatures.

If I am not mistaken or embellishing, it should be the view of a not very famous philosopher from Europe, who said:

"The reason why people cling to life and fear death is entirely the fault of the sun. The existence of the sun has an intangible power that awakens the will to live in living things, especially humans. Therefore, if the sun were to be destroyed and humans were still able to survive, humans, due to the loss of the will to live, would view life and death the same, and would regard death as an unremarkable path."

Therefore, from a historical or current worldview, excluding all kinds of violence and accidents, general deaths from illness mostly occur at night; when there is no sunlight.

And dying patients, knowing that their serious illness is difficult to cure, often ask those nearby, "What time is it?" or "Is it almost dawn?" From this tone, one can infer that the patient's subconscious seems to be saying that the patient hopes for dawn, hopes to see the sun of the next day. If they see the sun, it seems that they can get through the next day.

I have proposed such a deep question to my reader friends. If you are interested, I hope you can take a sip of strong tea, puff a faint smoke, and then think about it quietly.

Chang Zhi said it well:

Art must have a certain distance from real life.

Because this distance is precisely where the aesthetic realm lies. Like a doctor, no matter how compassionate he is, he must have apparent "cruelty" when performing surgery. His heart can be soft, but his hand must be hard.

Tai Sheng criticized my personality, saying, "You are the most passionate one, but you are also the most cruel one."

I frankly admitted his words. What should be added and explained is that when I cruelly handle a matter, I do not selfishly feel happy, I only feel boundless pain.

In life, for the sake of tomorrow, I also have times when I perform surgery on myself. Others observe me from the surface and feel that I am calm and indifferent to the point of being uncaring. However, my heart is trembling, a phenomenon that will never be noticed by the naked eye.

I have deeply understood what Dickens called the mystery between hearts.
