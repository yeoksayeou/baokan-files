### Japanese Reparations Estimated at Ten Million Tons; China May Receive Thirty Percent

[This newspaper news] Regarding the amount of Japanese reparations, there are three estimates: the highest is 12 million tons, the next is 9 million tons, and the lowest is 7 million tons. China may receive 30% of the total amount. The United States has agreed to this, and it is reported that Britain is not opposed, but it must be approved by the Allied Council for Japan. The current problem is China's ability to utilize it.

[Associated Press, Nanjing, 7th] Yun Zhen, representative of the Resources Committee in the United States and head of the receiving delegation in Japan, recently returned from Japan and hosted reporters today, saying: The Far Eastern Commission has designated all materials for Japanese reparations to the Allied countries, and China can receive 30% of the total. According to the initial reparations plan proposed by General Lay, thirteen types of Japanese materials, totaling 10 million tons, have been reserved for reparations. The first 30% will be shipped to China, the Philippines, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom. China will receive half of it alone, and the other three countries will receive half of it together. China's wartime losses are no less than 30 million US dollars. Whether it can obtain full compensation depends on Japan's economic capacity. Regarding the reparations, the attitude of the United States is more generous than expected. Japan's heavy industry, especially arms factories, has long been dismantled and shipped to other Allied countries as compensation. There is no problem in transporting the reparations to China, but the cost is extremely difficult. If Japanese machinery is used properly, it will greatly help China's postwar reconstruction. Some of it was purchased from Germany and is still in good condition. The final reparations plan proposed by General Lay has been completed and submitted to President Truman for review. Differences of opinion among the Allied countries have hindered the smooth implementation of the reparations process.

### Planned Economy Plan is Extensive; Main Aim is to Revitalize the Countryside; Intended to Be Implemented First in the Yellow River Basin

[This newspaper's Nanjing dispatch on the 7th] At its routine meeting on the 6th, the National Defense Council discussed and approved the implementation of a planned economy. It is learned that the plan covers a very wide range of content, but its main aim is to formulate an economic plan that needs to be improved in light of China's current situation and in line with China's existing environment. This newspaper's reporter specially interviewed Xiao Zheng, Deputy Minister of Economic Affairs, to explain the meaning of the planned economy and its implementation methods. According to him, the plan has been decided to be handed over to the National Economic Commission for implementation. In the past, the government had drafted a five-year economic plan, but that plan was based on the general ideal of a normal state in which everything in the country had returned to peacetime. Heavy industry and various equipment were planned to be made with machines from foreign countries. Seeing that everything is still in turmoil today, it is naturally impossible to implement it as desired, so this plan was drafted. The core of this plan is to revitalize the rural economy, stimulate industrial construction, and improve the land policy in accordance with Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Principle of People's Livelihood. In the vast rural areas, small farmers' land is merged into standard farms in the form of cooperatives, and then to cooperative farms, implementing collective cultivation. Scientific methods are used to improve cultivation techniques, achieve mechanized farming, build water conservancy, and facilitate transportation. At the same time, the agricultural construction required to adopt a fixed order system, ordering goods from urban factories, so that industrial development and production will not be stagnant. Thus, the rural economy will prosper and industry can also develop. The plan is intended to be implemented first in the Yellow River Basin Pacification Zone in North China, starting with improving the newly recovered areas, and then expanding to the whole country.

[This newspaper's Nanjing dispatch on the 7th] The Economic Policy Committee held a meeting on the morning of the 7th. Wang Yunwu and Chen Lifu attended to discuss the implementation details of the economic measures plan.

Main Responsibilities of the National Economic Commission

[This newspaper's Nanjing dispatch on the 7th] The main responsibilities of the National Economic Commission, which will decide and supervise important national economic policies, will be the following five: 1. Deciding on important economic policies; 2. Formulating economic plans and programs; 3. Fully utilizing resources; 4. Supervising specific economic measures; 5. Reviewing and linking the work of various economic departments. In addition to the chairman, the committee will have one secretary-general and two deputy secretaries. The heads of agencies such as the Ministry of Communications, Agriculture, Finance, Food, Social Affairs, Economy, Water, and Resources, the director of the Executive Headquarters, the secretary-general of the Executive Yuan, and the president of the National Bank will all be ex officio members. In addition, the President of the Executive Yuan will request the National Government to appoint ten to twenty members. The committee may also establish special committees when necessary.

[This newspaper's Nanjing dispatch on the 7th] According to the economic emergency measures plan, all non-urgent expenditures in the budgets of various government departments this year should be postponed, and the Executive Yuan will consult with the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics to properly formulate cleaning measures. It is reported that the Executive Yuan and the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics have convened many meetings, but because the term "non-urgent need" is difficult to interpret, and each agency believes that its expenditures are all urgent routine matters, no agreement has yet been reached.

[This newspaper's Nanjing dispatch on the 7th] The draft "Implementation Measures for Wage Evaluation" has been drafted by the Ministry of Social Affairs and submitted to the Executive Yuan three days ago. It can be implemented in 30 designated locations across the country after approval. It is reported that the authorities do not intend to set up another evaluation organization, but will have the local social administrative agencies in charge handle the matter in coordination with local industrial and commercial groups. At the same time, the evaluation targets will be limited to certain designated occupations.

### Retired Military Officers Tilling the Northeast; A Great Plan is Being Actively Implemented; Retired Officers Are Required to Farm Themselves in Principle

[This newspaper's Beiping dispatch on the 7th] The great plan of retired military officers tilling the Northeast is now being actively implemented under the auspices of the Planning Department of the Northeast Reclamation Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense. Lieutenant General Gao Zijie, Director of the Reclamation Bureau, has arrived in Shenyang to discuss the handover of the reclamation area with relevant parties. There are more than 95.6 million mu of arable land in the Northeast, including more than 10 million mu of military land, which are also planned and utilized by the bureau. The bureau will also take over the Panshan Reclamation Area. This area was originally a Japanese immigrant reclamation area, adjacent to Yingkou, located on the right bank of the Liao River, and facing the Bohai Sea to the south. Initially, it was alkaline wasteland, but it was transformed into fertile land through Japanese soil improvement. It now has 124,000 mu of cultivated land (two-thirds of which are rice paddies and the rest are dry land), and about 256,000 mu of wasteland. The land is fertile and the harvest is abundant. The area has a network of railways and highways, a suitable climate, and well-equipped machinery, second only to the Tennessee Valley Authority reclamation area in the United States, run by Roosevelt. The bureau plans to use this reclamation area to pilot the allotment of land to retired officers for cultivation. It is estimated that there are four retired officer battalions from Beiping, Zhengzhou, Wuxi, and Jinan. The Reclamation Bureau has sent personnel to pick them up, and they are expected to arrive in the Northeast before the end of March. According to the bureau's plan, retired officers must cultivate the land themselves. The area of the land should be 100 mu of cultivated land or 200 mu of wasteland per household. Each retired officer is allowed to bring one or two assistants for cultivation. If they are unable to do so, they may apply to the bureau for approval to hire people to help, but they cannot rent or transfer the land. The reclamation area will distribute the original Japanese-built houses to the officers and their families, and will also issue the necessary furniture, cooking utensils, miscellaneous items, seeds, fertilizers, and livestock (including pigs, sheep, chickens, ducks, geese, etc.). The travel expenses for retired officers to go to the reclamation area will be provided by the state. After arrival, the first year's grain and family rations will be issued as usual, halved in the second year, and stopped in the third year. The agricultural operations in the reclamation area will adopt a cooperative approach, making full use of new agricultural implements and scientific methods. All transportation, water conservancy, culture, education, and other matters in the reclamation area will also be managed by the Reclamation Bureau. In addition, hospitals, elementary schools, libraries, clubs, agricultural and reclamation drama troupes, supply and consumption production credit cooperatives will be established to coordinate the education of children and the welfare of families, making it a paradise for veterans.

[Central News Agency, Bangkok, 6th] Among the 3,000 Chinese passengers who arrived here last week from Shantou aboard the "Tucksud Hed" wheel, a cholera epidemic was discovered, and the Siamese government has conducted an investigation into quarantine. It is reported that the number of patients has reached 250 to date, with more than 20 deaths. Three European passengers have also been infected and have been sent to the hospital. At the same time, the Siamese public health authorities have temporarily quarantined the other passengers to prevent further spread of the infection. After the cholera outbreak, Chinese, English, and Siamese newspapers here criticized the shipping company and the responsible parties at the Port of Shantou for allowing the number of passengers to be so high. Almost every ship arriving from Shantou is overcrowded. Previously, many ships had experienced unfortunate incidents. The normal capacity of the Tucksud Hed is 800 people, but it carried nearly 3,000 passengers.

### Chen Zhi-ping Visits Quirino: Negotiations on Sino-Philippine Treaty May Resume

[United Press, Manila, 7th] Chen Zhi-ping, the Chinese envoy to the Philippines, met with Philippine Vice President and Foreign Minister Quirino yesterday. The press believes that negotiations on the Sino-Philippine treaty may soon resume.

[United Press, Manila, 6th] The Manila Chronicle criticized in an editorial today the "tough language" used by Chen Zhi-ping, the Chinese envoy to the Philippines, in the recent breakdown of treaty negotiations. It is said: "We learned from the Philippine government's reply to the Chinese embassy's note requesting the cessation of negotiations that the Chinese envoy used tough language, not only in the note but also in the envoy's last meeting with Philippine Vice President and Foreign Minister Quirino. Mr. Chen seems to have abandoned diplomatic language and demanded the cessation of negotiations out of emotional impulse. Chinese diplomacy has always been known for its gentle language, even when pursuing tough policies. In this regard, Quirino seems to be more patient than Chen, because even though Chen made 'unreasonable' accusations, Quirino still expressed his willingness to continue negotiations in a friendly spirit in his reply."

There was also a small amount of hair inside the set. After Zhu woke up in the hospital, he repeatedly cried out "I failed her" because he could not die with the woman.

Editorial

### The Meaning of Commemorating Women's Day

Women's Day comes and goes every year, so people naturally have many feelings about the arrival of this year's Women's Day. However, this year's Women's Day has a particularly profound meaning for us Chinese people and for Chinese women. We don't need to mention the history of women here, as someone will surely mention it on the many commemorative occasions of Women's Day today; what we want to point out is that with the arrival of Women's Day, we especially want to raise women's political awareness.

The so-called women's movement is actually the women's participation in politics movement, the women's participation in elections movement. This movement has its historical origins, but because the objective conditions of society were not mature, this movement only began to rise in the early 20th century. After the Second World War, even in France, the birthplace of modern democracy and also the most backward country in women's rights, there were constitutional provisions for women's participation in politics. It can be said that the goals hoped for by the early women's rights movement have now been largely achieved in political law. The so-called "bluestocking" group in the early days of the French Revolution would surely smile if they saw that today, in the national legislative bodies, such as the solemn parliament, there are also women representatives, and in the national government agencies, there are also female civil servants. Even in China, women's participation in politics has achieved considerable results. In today's highest national legislative and supervisory bodies, there are female members, and in the National Assembly, which recently completed the task of constitution-making, there are also our female representatives; moreover, in our constitution and other laws, the status of men and women is equal. It must be said that the so-called women's liberation movement has achieved considerable gains by this point.

But what we find regrettable is that the equality women have gained in law and politics is not necessarily equality in social status. Moreover, looking at some of the recent measures taken by governments in various places, it seems that they are creating or deepening the deterioration of women's status in society. Since the founding of the Republic of China, because many female comrades, such as Qiu Jin, participated in the early revolution, the practice of advocating prostitution has always been strictly prohibited, except in concessions under foreign influence and areas with particularly strong feudal forces; this was because of the importance attached to women's social status. However, in France, which has always allowed public prostitution while not allowing women to participate in politics, has changed its style by allowing women to participate in politics and banning public prostitution. Today, we see governments in various places encouraging and promoting public prostitution. Japan has also always allowed public prostitution, but now, under the rule of General MacArthur, it does not allow the existence of entertainment districts like Yoshiwara. France and Japan, which are backward in women's rights, no longer allow public prostitution, but we are promoting public prostitution today. Isn't this moving backwards? Today, we still want to advocate "strict separation between men and women." Isn't this moving backwards again? All of these are signs of disregarding women's social status. Today, with the arrival of Women's Day, we want to raise the awareness of our female compatriots about these discriminatory measures against women; what they should strive for is not the number of seats in the National Assembly or the Legislative Yuan, but rather discriminatory measures related to the status of women themselves.

Today, it is of particularly profound significance that we commemorate this Women's Day in China. Our country's fundamental law was formulated by the National Assembly last year, and this year will be the year of constitutional governance. The goals that the Chinese women's rights movement strived for in the early 20th century have now been achieved in China. We women across the country cherish this achievement and use all their strength to safeguard this precious constitution. The greatest significance of commemorating Women's Day today is that female compatriots across the country maintain this constitution with their actions.

### Procedures for Cracking Down on Hoarding and Price Gouging

The economic emergency measures plan is divided into six items, but its focus is actually on suppressing prices. Also announced at the same time were (1) banning the buying and selling of gold, (2) prohibiting the circulation of foreign currency, and (3) strengthening financial controls. Their direct and indirect effects are also nothing more than to suppress prices.

So, what kind of measures should be taken to suppress prices? Is it enough to just monitor, investigate strictly, detain, and prosecute? Are these measures applicable to any price control? And are these measures applicable unconditionally? If we study it further, it is not difficult to discover that there are many conditions and restrictions, which are not without room for consideration from a legal point of view.

First, Article 2 of Plan (4) states: All daily necessities in each designated area should be strictly priced and handled in accordance with the Regulations on Cracking Down on Violations of Price Limits and the Implementation Plan for Price Assessment. This has already clearly stated that (1) region, (2) type, (3) limit, and (4) certain procedures must be followed. At the same time, it is also stipulated that the Regulations on the Management of Agriculture, Mining, Industry, and Commerce in Emergency Periods and the Measures for Cracking Down on Hoarding of Important Daily Necessities in Emergency Periods should be strictly enforced. According to Article 1 of the Regulations on Cracking Down on Violations of Price Limits, the so-called price limits are limited to daily necessities, except as stipulated in Article 8 of the National General Mobilization Law. Article 2 also clearly defines the conditions constituting the so-called violation, and Articles 3 and 5 designate the responsible authorities for this crackdown, which is the Bureau of Social Affairs in municipalities under the direct jurisdiction of the Executive Yuan, and the police bureau is responsible for investigation. And how to punish is listed in Article 6. This is the way to suppress prices that should be followed, which is originally stipulated very clearly. Moreover, the so-called assessment is not without standards. According to the Implementation Measures for Price Assessment, the Executive Yuan should first order the establishment of a Price Assessment Committee, and then the committee should decide on the types of goods to be assessed, which should be approved and announced by the local government. Then, the standard should be negotiated based on the cost of the goods and adding appropriate profits, and then implemented after being announced by the government. In other words, before the above procedures are completed, there is no so-called assessed price and violation of assessed price, let alone how to punish. Articles 7, 8, and 9 of the Measures for Cracking Down on Hoarding of Important Daily Necessities also stipulate that the areas, types, and names of all items to be cracked down on should be ordered by the Ministry of Economic Affairs to the local competent authorities to announce to the public within their jurisdictions in advance. Before the announcement is made, the hoarded items, whether they are from the same industry or not, may be reported and sold within a time limit. If they cannot be sold by the deadline, the government is allowed to sell them on their behalf or purchase them at a fair price. Therefore, even if there is hoarding behavior before the legal price assessment and announcement are implemented, it is not without room for flexibility. Because according to the current laws and regulations, what should be cracked down on is clearly designated as daily necessities, and important necessities, and the Bureau of Social Affairs and the police bureau are responsible for carrying out this crackdown. Only violations of assessed prices should be investigated and punished, and the work of reviewing assessed prices belongs to the Price Assessment Committee. As to whether the Assessment Committee should be organized, it should wait for the designation by the Executive Yuan, and the Bureau of Social Affairs is responsible for approving and announcing the assessed prices. Items hoarded before the announcement may be sold by themselves within a time limit or requested for purchase. Therefore, although these laws and regulations are mostly promulgated during non-emergency periods, they can be said to be well-organized, clearly layered, and consider all aspects of law, reason, and human feelings.

Since the promulgation of the emergency measures plan, the work of suppressing prices has been actively carried out, and a few hoarders have fallen into the legal net. It is their own fault that they speculate, hoard, and raise prices, but before the legal procedures are completed, they are probably still somewhat confused and do not know how to take legal paths to remedy the situation. This is indeed a regrettable thing.

According to these laws and regulations promulgated by the central government, the so-called suppressing prices is not a purely passive matter. For example, Article 6 of the Detailed Rules for the Implementation of the Measures for the Supply of Daily Necessities stipulates that the government may sell goods to regulate the market when necessary, and the industry should request government assistance when it encounters difficulties in funding, raw materials, power, and transportation. Articles 4, 5, 7, 8, 17, 21, and 25 of the Emergency Regulations on the Management of Agriculture, Mining, Industry, and Commerce stipulate that the Ministry of Economic Affairs should not only stipulate standards and urge improvement for specific enterprises or goods, but also invest, assist, purchase, take over management, or even nationalize and directly operate them when necessary. This is completely of a positive nature. The key to suppressing prices lies in increasing production, which cannot be achieved by simply cracking down, restricting, rationing, and punishing. Therefore, to truly suppress prices, both the fundamental and superficial aspects must be carried out simultaneously.

Now, the superficial aspects have been launched one after another. It seems that the fundamental aspects have not yet been noticed or implemented. We know very well that most of the above-mentioned laws and regulations are of a wartime nature, and many aspects may not be practical. However, there are also many that can be implemented. If only the parts related to cracking down and restrictions are cited, while the parts that support and promote are completely ignored, it would be taking things out of context and being too biased. Especially the preparatory work for the crackdown has not yet been completed, as if a few policemen can suppress prices. If it were really that easy, the trends of speculation, raising prices, hoarding, and cornering the market would not have survived to this day!

[Associated Press] Moscow, 6th - As foreign guests began to arrive to attend the Four Foreign Ministers Conference, Moscow was suddenly hit by a heavy snowstorm today, the most severe of the winter, with temperatures dropping to five degrees.

[Central News Agency] Moscow, 7th - Special dispatch: The Moscow authorities have prepared to receive representatives from various countries coming here for the meeting. The four best hotels have been repainted, the specially designated rooms have been cleaned, the carpets have been changed, the lamps and doorknobs have been polished, and all kinds of glass ornaments have been washed. Elevator operators have been issued brand new uniforms with silver trim on their sleeves and collars. Each hotel is equipped with several English translators. Government vehicles have been allocated for the use of representatives from various countries. The first group of reporters and photographers has arrived, and the next group will arrive in the next two days. There are 20 British reporters and 36 American reporters. Bevin will travel by train from Calais via Berlin, Warsaw, and Brest-Litovsk, and then transfer to a Soviet train from there, and come to Moscow with the British Ambassador to the Soviet Union who will be there to meet him.

### Review of the Agenda of the Foreign Ministers Conference: Disputes Will Inevitably Arise over Germany's Status and Borders; Regional Security Pacts Are Also on the Agenda

[Washington News Agency] Berlin, 7th - Political observers here recently said that only the Austrian issue is fully prepared for a final resolution at the upcoming Moscow Four Foreign Ministers Conference. The agenda of this meeting can be divided into three main categories: (1) amending the current organization occupying Germany; (2) clarifying Germany's future status in the treaty; and (3) drafting a treaty to restore Austria's independence. Although the last item is expected to be resolved at the Moscow conference, its importance is self-evident, including guaranteeing Austria's independence and German property within Austria. Regarding guaranteeing Austria's independence, the only effective way is for Austria to sign this declaration, and other signatory countries of the peace treaty also need to guarantee it together. France has argued that additional guarantees should be added to prevent a recurrence of the situation in 1938. The United Kingdom's attitude is more reserved, unwilling to get involved in continental entanglements, but hopes that Austria and the Danube countries can be economically linked. The Soviet Union still opposes adding guarantees, believing that the guarantees of the United Nations Charter are sufficient. The Soviet Union's attitude is probably due to the fact that it would harm Yugoslavia's claims to Carinthia.

Secondly, the definition of the issue of German property in Austria still needs to be determined, such as whether the property confiscated in Austria after the German-Austrian merger should also be included in this category. The United Kingdom, the United States, and France all believe that the Soviet Union's proposed plan to eliminate the Nazis is enough to deprive Austria of the property necessary to restore its economic strength. Regarding Germany's current and future status, the four countries are still in contact, so the Moscow Conference will not be able to lay the foundation for a peace treaty immediately. Its future political status and border issues will inevitably become the subject of lengthy debates and may hinder the progress of negotiations. Even issues such as the occupying powers' administration of Germany, the elimination of Nazi elements, Germany's economic and financial institutions, and the establishment of a central government will also cause disputes over opinions. For example, on the issue of reparations, the Soviet Union wants to extract everything from Germany, while the United Kingdom and the United States want to restore its economic strength first and reduce the cost of the occupying forces before implementing the reparations plan. The differences between the two sides are great. It seems that the above issues cannot be easily resolved. In addition, British Foreign Secretary Bevin and US Secretary of State Marshall will take the opportunity to negotiate with the Soviet Union in Moscow to discuss temporary agreements on the spheres of influence of major powers in Europe, Asia, and the Pacific, and regional security pacts, such as the recent alliance treaty between the United Kingdom and France, which may be expanded into a four-nation pact.

### Peace Treaty Is Unfair, Refuse to Sign

Words of the Leader of the German Social Democratic Party

[Agence France-Presse] Rome, 7th - The leader of the German Social Democratic Party, Schumacher, recently stated to the Italian "Times" here that if the terms stipulated in the German peace treaty are too harsh, he will refuse to sign it. Germany is the same as other countries and does not want to be butchered. Some German nationalists are still dreaming of a Nazi-style "Greater Germany," and a group of conciliators hope to restore the borders of 1937, but those with national common sense hope that the eastern and western borders can allow Germany to survive, and that is enough. In terms of the final change of territory, merging land is the worst way to pay reparations. The country is willing to pay reparations, but first it must heal its wounds. Germany now only hopes to be allowed to participate in the Moscow Conference to jointly discuss the peace treaty, and the treaty can only be signed after a freely elected parliament representing the Central Government of the entire country is established.

### Panamanian Government Declares: Refuses to Ratify the Italian Peace Treaty

[United Press] Washington, 6th - The Panamanian Foreign Ministry issued a note to the four powers on the 6th, stating that the government refuses to ratify the Italian Peace Treaty because the Panamanian government believes that the treaty is too harsh. Panama supports the claims of Argentina and Uruguay and is working hard to ease the conditions.

### Fifty American Celebrities Offer Opinions on the German Issue: Suggest Five Points for Adoption

[Agence France-Presse] New York, 6th - A national conference was held here tonight to discuss the German issue, arguing that Germany must no longer be a military threat, but Germany's future economic situation should not be ignored. The following suggestions were then passed and submitted to the Moscow Four Foreign Ministers Conference: (1) Establish a civil affairs committee to manage Germany, so that it can become economically stable and develop a democratic government. (2) Recognize the demands of France and the Saar region for economic ties. (3) Recognize Poland's current western border. (4) Germany's inland river shipping should be kept internationally free. (5) Germany's coal, steel, and chemical plants should be jointly managed by a four-nation committee. This national conference was initiated by 50 celebrities, including Mrs. Roosevelt, former Secretary of State Welles, great scientist Einstein, and former Treasury Secretary Morgenthau.

### Truman Returns to the White House: Will Issue an Important Statement; Members of Congress Support Aid to Greece Policy

[Associated Press] Washington, 7th - Observers here stated today that President Truman has taken a day off during his tour and returned to the White House to handle official business. Perhaps within 48 hours, he will issue another important statement on government policy.

[Our Newspaper] San Francisco, 7th - Broadcast: Senator Tom Connally recently gave a cautionary speech in the Senate, saying: "If the United States wants to obtain leadership in the Near East without a 'community of interests' as a basis, it will inevitably fail. We are now being asked to take over the land that Britain intends to abandon, but we should not inherit British policies, but must follow the inherent policies of the United States."

[Associated Press] Washington, 6th - Democratic Senator Barkley declared today after meeting with other Democratic senators that a majority of senators in the party supported lending to Greece to prevent the collapse of the current government. The Greek government's emergency request for assistance cannot be ignored. Barkley also said that, in his personal opinion, since Britain is no longer able to provide economic assistance to Greece, if the United States does not step in to replace it, the current Greek government will inevitably collapse. Democratic Senator McMahon said that the current struggle between the Communist Party and the anti-communist government in Greece is a major decision in American foreign policy that must be paid attention to. Such dangerous areas exist everywhere from Korea to Europe. Barkley also said that the amount of money to be lent to Greece has been set at 250 million US dollars, and this move is by no means anti-Soviet. If British troops withdraw from Greece, American troops will not go to replace them.

### Bulgaria Seals Border with Turkey: Greek Army Will Launch a Full-Scale Attack on Guerrillas

[Associated Press] Istanbul, 7th - Bulgaria closed its border with Turkey yesterday, and nothing is allowed to pass except goods carried by trains. Observers here believe that Bulgaria has taken the same action on the border with Greece. Diplomatic circles say that the ban will last for ten days, and the reason may be military training, but it cannot be definitively said.

[Agence France-Presse] Athens, 7th - It is learned that the Greek army, navy, and air force will launch a full-scale offensive against the guerrillas in northern Greece between the 12th and 15th of this month. The navy and air force have sent officers to the Qilai area to join General Yage's headquarters. At the same time, warships and landing craft have also been concentrated on the sea surface in Thessaloniki and Kavala, waiting for orders. In addition, several air force teams are ordered to fly to northern Greece every day.

### American Warship Sails to Athens

### British Spending in Greece and Palestine: More Than 160 Million Pounds in Two Years

[Agence France-Presse] London, 6th - Chancellor of the Exchequer Dalton recently stated in the House of Commons that the total cost borne by the United Kingdom in Greece and Palestine in the past two years is no less than 169 million pounds. In Greece, the United Kingdom spent 87 million pounds, of which 48 million pounds were used to maintain British troops, and the remaining part was used for the British promise to provide mutual assistance to Greece in 1945. In Palestine, the military expenditure was 72 million pounds.

### American Trusteeship Plan: Security Council Approves

[Associated Press] Lake Success, 7th - The Security Council met at 3 p.m. today to terminate the trusteeship of the former Japanese-mandated island of the Pacific Ocean and passed the United States' plan to occupy the island. The United States has full administrative and military control and can build secret military bases for the security of US national defense. The Soviet Union proposed three amendments, but they were all unimportant. The United Kingdom and Australia believe that the United States' actions seem to be too early and should wait for the completion of the peace treaty with Japan.

### Soviet Supreme Council: Sends Delegation to Visit the UK

[Agence France-Presse] London, 6th - British Justice Minister Thewitis recently announced in the House of Lords that a delegation from the Soviet Supreme Council will visit the United Kingdom at the invitation of the British Parliament. It is expected that they will arrive in London around the 11th, and the House of Lords and the House of Commons are scheduled to host a banquet on the 14th to welcome the Soviet delegation.

### France Purchases Military Equipment from the UK: Agreement Established Between the Two Sides

[Associated Press] London, 6th - Official sources announced today that French military authorities have reached an agreement with the British War Office to purchase aircraft, guns, transport ships, and other materials to equip an airborne division of 16,000 men. However, spokesmen for the British Foreign Office and the French Embassy said that this agreement does not stipulate the standardization of military equipment between the United Kingdom and France. According to other official sources, Belgium also hopes to purchase some military equipment from the United Kingdom soon.

### French Prime Minister Talks About Policy Toward Vietnam

[Agence France-Presse] Paris, 6th - French Prime Minister Ramadier said today: "We have made it clear before that the solution to the Vietnam issue cannot be forced upon us. We hope that the Viet Minh can understand this point. We have taken measures so that our efforts can be maintained as long as there is a need. France never intends to obstruct the national aspirations of the Vietnamese, and has no objection to the merger of Cochinchina, Annam, and Tonkin, but this unity should not benefit any one of them alone. I firmly believe that if we have a policy of understanding, we will be able to achieve the results currently brought about by military development. The policy we have adopted towards Vietnam has now entered a constructive stage." Ramadier also said: "Commissioner Bollaert still retains his command of all troops, and all military operations should be executed by the Commander-in-Chief under Bollaert's orders. The government's appointment of Bollaert to a position without Da Xiang Lilou's responsibilities is aimed at handing over the affairs of Vietnam to civil officials. As for the situation in various parts of Vietnam, Dongpu Village will obtain autonomy in the future and will be given full technical assistance by France. As for Laos, the problem is more complicated because the social organization of Laos is still in a semi-feudal state. In Cochinchina, the activities of the Viet Minh guerrillas have decreased, and we recognize that Cochinchina can establish its own government and are striving to give the Cochinchina government full freedom. The French Federation is built on the strength of ensuring the security of the entire Federation, and it is currently at a critical moment."

### Italy Experiences Red Rain

[Agence France-Presse, Bama, 7th] Last night, the Liguria region of Italy was hit by red rain that lasted for several minutes. After the rain, the streets and items were covered with red residue. It is believed that the red color in the rain was caused by ash from the eruption of Mount Etna's lava. The volcano is currently erupting, and the ash is being carried by the wind and mixed with raindrops as they fall.

### Truman's Daughter Debuts Singing

### Prospects for World Relief Work After the End of UNRRA

— Special Translation from Our Newspaper Compilation Room

The United States is currently planning a new international relief program that will strengthen the power of Britain and the United States in their struggle against the Soviet Union in Southern Europe. American food and other relief supplies can only be given to friendly countries that can prove they are truly in need. The majority of American relief supplies for 1947 will be shipped to Italy, Austria, and Greece. After the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) ends, governments that possess large armies or use food as a political weapon will no longer receive assistance from the United States.

This new US policy will be a major blow to the Soviet Union and its satellite states. These countries have already received assistance from UNRRA for reconstruction and development, totaling US$1.46 billion, which accounts for more than one-third of UNRRA's entire budget. Now, this vast flood is about to be reduced to a trickle. Even this trickle will not be shared by most countries within the Soviet sphere of influence.

Behind the new US policy lies a contradiction: 72% of UNRRA relief supplies were provided by the United States, but the United States only has one vote on the UNRRA Central Committee, which is composed of nine countries and has the power to allocate relief supplies. The relief supplies provided by Britain, the United States, and Canada account for 95%, while the three countries only have one-third of the voting rights.

Last summer, a US plane was forced to land in Yugoslavia, causing an uproar within the country. However, during this period, the United States still had to transport relief supplies and machinery to Yugoslavia because of this contradictory fact. A similar incident occurred in Albania: while the country was shooting at British ships and expelling American diplomats, it continued to receive assistance from UNRRA.

Future Relief Work: Direct Negotiations Between Countries

The way in which world relief work is handled in 1947 will be different. After the end of UNRRA, relief work will be established on the basis of individual country-to-country relations. United Nations agencies will be able to assist in fact-finding and serve as a medium for consultation; that is, donor countries and recipient countries will negotiate directly, and United Nations agencies will only be responsible for providing advice and information.

The Economic and Financial Committee of the United Nations General Assembly has established a special committee composed of ten countries to determine which countries need assistance, how much assistance they need, and what they need. The committee's report is submitted to the member states of the United Nations, and then they consult on how to implement the relief plan.

UNRRA has already allocated relief supplies and equipment worth US$340 million to fifteen countries, which will be shipped out in succession to facilitate its closure. UNRRA hopes to complete the delivery of supplies to Europe by the end of March and to the East by the end of June. After that, it will close its doors.

The final meeting of the UNRRA Central Committee resolved to accept the US proposal to adjust the allocation of the final batch of relief supplies to ensure that the countries most in need receive the relief supplies when they need them most. All of UNRRA's current tasks, except for food supply, will be handled separately by several agencies belonging to the United Nations. Refugee relief work will be handled by the International Refugee Organization, which is in the process of being established. Agricultural reconstruction will be handled by the Food and Agriculture Organization. Disease assistance will be handled by the World Health Organization. Welfare work will be handled by the Social Committee. Industrial reconstruction is not a top priority and will be left to the countries themselves to handle. Countries that need additional assistance can request assistance from the World Bank.

The United States is Seeking to Conserve Funds; Appropriations Will Take Time

Those responsible for relief work, given UNRRA's hasty closure and the slow progress of the new agencies, are deeply concerned that the efforts will be a drop in the bucket and too slow to meet the urgent need. This question must be answered by the US Congress. The US State Department has no funds to provide relief to other countries and must request appropriations from Congress. The total amount of relief supplies needed by Europe in 1947 is estimated at US$400 million. The amount that the US State Department requests Congress to approve will probably not exceed half of that amount. The remaining amount will have to be supplemented by encouraging other countries (mainly Canada and Britain). (Translator's note: President Truman has already requested Congress to appropriate US$350 million to provide relief to the liberated countries.)

The US Congress is implementing austerity measures and may not be willing for the United States to spend more money to provide relief to other countries. In addition, whether Congress can act quickly is also a question. The next few months will be the most critical period. It will take time for this issue to be discussed in Congress, and it will take even longer for relief supplies to be delivered to the countries.

US officials are well aware that relief work will inevitably be delayed and acknowledge that countries have little hope of receiving direct assistance from the US government before the spring of 1947. During this transitional period, the United States can only place its hopes on other countries and UNRRA's final batch of relief supplies. Those who advocate that the United States allocate a large amount of money for foreign relief in 1947 may gain the sympathy of American farmers, who are worried that the mountains of surplus agricultural products will depress prices and harm farmers' interests.

In 1946, American agricultural production broke previous records. Unless a large amount of exports can be maintained in 1947, the United States will have a surplus of agricultural products, which will be enough to affect the current abundant income of farmers. The new relief plan that replaces UNRRA is a victory for the US State Department, or at least a partial failure for former UNRRA Director La Guardia.

Relief to the Soviet Union and Its Allies Will Cease

La Guardia argued that relief work must be placed under international control to prevent aid-giving countries from engaging in favoritism. The US State Department's response is: there will be no favoritism, and countries that possess large armies and use factories to manufacture weapons will not be supplied with food. This clearly refers to the Soviet Union and its satellite states.

The new relief plan is a compromise. The question of which countries need relief will be decided by a ten-nation (including the Soviet Union) special committee, but the United States is not bound by the committee's recommendations.

The countries that will receive American relief supplies in 1947 have generally been determined. The United States has already indicated that Italy and Austria will be the main countries to receive American relief supplies, with Greece coming in third. Poland and Hungary may also receive some assistance. According to the new policy, relief supplies to Albania, Yugoslavia, and the Soviet Union will probably be stopped.

In the next six months, world relief work will encounter the greatest difficulties. After this period, the harvests of 1947 can be used to provide some sustenance. By 1948, governments may completely abandon international relief and allow private organizations to handle relief work. (Translated from "World Report Weekly")

### British Policy of Withdrawal from India Passed After Heated Debate in the Lower House; Churchill's Fierce Criticism Proves Ineffective

[Reuters, London, 7th] After two days of debate in the Lower House on the issue of India, the House last night rejected the opposition party's motion to refuse to accept the government's India policy by a vote of 337 to 185. Subsequently, the House passed the government's motion approving the government's policy of transferring power in India to Indians in June 1948.

[Reuters, London, 6th] Opposition leader Churchill spoke on the second day of the debate on India policy in the Lower House, suggesting that the India issue be submitted to the United Nations for resolution. Churchill said that since the government's India policy had failed, it would be reasonable and honorable to ask a larger organization for assistance. Churchill referred to the Indian government led by Nehru as a completely abnormal government, and that it was a major mistake to entrust the Indian government to Nehru. Churchill expressed regret that the government had failed to explain the reasons for the recall of Indian Governor Wavell. He also pointed out that India's political parties cannot represent the people, and that handing over the Indian government to this so-called political class is tantamount to transferring power to straw men, who will disappear without a trace in a few years.

Prime Minister Attlee Responds, Mocking Churchill

[Reuters, London, 6th] During the debate on India policy in the Lower House, Prime Minister Attlee responded to the debate on behalf of the government, stating that although he could not predict how India would develop in the future, he felt that Churchill's experience with the India issue was fifty years out of date. Regarding the resolution stipulating a deadline for returning power to Indians, he acknowledged that this deadline was indeed very short, but based on warnings from India, it was appropriate to set a definite deadline.

### Tojo Hospitalized Due to Illness

[United Press, Tokyo, 7th] Since the Tokyo War Crimes Tribunal opened in April of last year, former Japanese Prime Minister Tojo was unable to attend the trial for the first time on the 7th due to bronchitis. According to official statements, Tojo was sent to the US military's 361st Hospital at 2:30 AM on the 7th due to bronchitis. His condition is not serious.

### New Party Established in Japan

Kyodo Party and Kokumin Party Merge

[Kaizo-sha, Tokyo, 7th] The Kyodo Democratic Party and the Kokumin Party held separate congresses yesterday and today, respectively, to approve the formation of a new party, the "Kokumin Kyodo Party", and issued a statement of establishment today. The inaugural meeting will be held tomorrow. A total of 78 members of parliament will participate in the new party. The new party will temporarily adopt a committee system without a party leader, with Miki Takeo (formerly of the Kyodo Democratic Party) as secretary-general and Okada Seiichi (formerly of the Kokumin Party) as chairman of the Central Standing Committee.

### French Fake Diplomat Sentenced; Brinon Sentenced to Death

[Reuters, Paris, 6th] Brinon, the former Vichy "ambassador" to occupied France, was sentenced to death today by the Versailles court. Upon hearing the verdict, the defendant shouted, "Public opinion will judge after my death!"

### Too Many Generals, Too Few Soldiers in the US Military; Military Feels Difficulty

[United Press, Washington, 6th] A US Army officer said on the 6th that one of the difficulties for the US Army during peacetime is "too many generals, too few soldiers."

It is estimated that the current US Army has 1.07 million personnel, but there are as many as 10,590 colonels. During wartime, the Army had 8 million personnel, but only over 6,000 colonels. The current ratio of each colonel to soldiers is 1 to 65, while during wartime it was 1 to 755.

### Lewis's Contempt of Court Conviction Upheld by Supreme Court

[United Press, Washington, 6th] The US Supreme Court ruled today by a vote of 7 to 2 that United Mine Workers President John L. Lewis was guilty of contempt of court for refusing to comply with a federal court order to prevent a coal strike last November. This ruling is a great victory for President Truman in his struggle against Lewis and the union. The Supreme Court also approved the original sentence of Lewis being fined $10,000, but reduced the fine for the union from $3.5 million to $700,000. However, if the union carries out Lewis's threat to strike on April 1, the remaining $2.8 million will still be fined. Chief Justice Vinson's remarks during the sentencing were firm, stating that Lewis's contempt of the district court order was intentional. The union's ability to threaten the government and the welfare of the nation necessitates a large fine to demonstrate the seriousness of contempt of court. Lewis did not comment on the verdict, but the case is not over. Federal Judge Goldsborough will still hold a trial on whether Lewis has the right to cancel the wage contract between the union and the government. This trial has been delayed until now while awaiting the Supreme Court's ruling.

### Assembly Emphasizes Housing Shortage; Courts Should Pay Attention to Leasing Customs When Hearing Housing Disputes; Rent Issues to be Studied Jointly by Three Subcommittees; Construction Donation to be Discussed Today

[Report from our newspaper] The second meeting of the first session of the Municipal Council continued to be held at its new site in Tanggu at 9:30 am yesterday for its ninth session. In the morning, 105 councilors were present, and in the afternoon, 96 councilors were present. The mayor and heads of various municipal government bureaus were also present. The agenda originally scheduled for the morning was to discuss unresolved cases, and in the afternoon, the tenth session was to discuss the issue of the municipal construction donation. However, as there were many proposals discussed yesterday related to regulations, land administration, society, finance, civil affairs, finance, public utilities, public works, and sanitation, the issue of construction donation and other temporary motions were postponed for discussion at today's meeting. The meeting venue was set up on the fourth floor, which had been newly painted in bright vermillion and azure colors, making it particularly magnificent. At 9:00 am, Chairman Pan announced the opening of the meeting. A total of 19 motions were passed, and 2 motions were withdrawn. During the meeting, the issue of housing rentals and convenience for councilors received the most attention, with heated debates. The mayor and heads of various bureaus repeatedly stood up to explain, creating a very tense atmosphere. The afternoon session was extended by one hour, adjourning at 6:00 pm.

Regarding housing and lease disputes, two motions were presented at yesterday's meeting. One was "Please the Municipal Government maintain the resolution of the first session of the Municipal Council, clearly ordering all landlords in the city not to arbitrarily increase rents to maintain the livelihood of ordinary people, and stipulating that landlords must not refuse to deduct the portion of property tax from the rent, please pass a resolution to send it to the Municipal Government for effective implementation." The other was "Please recommend that the judicial authorities maintain housing leases to alleviate the housing shortage and ensure social peace and tranquility."

Fei Shusheng felt that the review opinion of the second motion, "The Housing Lease Committee has been revoked, and this case is difficult to handle," was inappropriate. The severity of the housing shortage has not diminished to this day. Public school teachers and staff who have been allocated housing are often forced to move out because they have not paid the gold bar premium. When they sue in court, the court not only does not provide protection, but also turns a blind eye to the plight of the tenants. Although this council does not have the right to interfere with the judicial authorities, it hopes to stand on the side of the citizens and send a letter requesting the court to protect the tenants and not favor the owners. Jiang Pinglu said that in general, landlords also have no way to deal with tenants. Chairman Pan said that it could be recommended that the judicial authorities pay attention to the housing shortage situation in the city and pay special attention to the leasing customs of the city when hearing housing dispute cases.

Mayor Wu then expressed his opinion, stating: Many houses in the neighborhoods are dirty and dilapidated because landlords are unable to afford the cost of repairs due to not increasing rents. However, increasing rents would increase the burden on tenants, so both sides face difficulties. As a result of the Municipal Government's considerations, it can only exempt newly built houses from rent restrictions in order to encourage house construction. In addition, it will request the China Trust Bureau to allocate 20 billion to build houses, but without results. Economic and price instability makes it difficult to find a reasonable solution, but treating it rigidly will turn it into a dead city. Although the Municipal Council can make recommendations to the court, the court cannot provide additional assistance outside of handling cases in accordance with the law. However, the practice of owners using premium fees should be strictly prohibited. Please the Municipal Council discuss together how to resolve it reasonably.

The case was combined with the first case for discussion in the afternoon. As a result, it was decided to submit it to the joint meeting of the Social, Legal, and Land Administration Committees for discussion and review. After the date of the joint meeting is scheduled, all councilors can participate in the discussion.

### Silver Shops and Others Submit Five Petitions

[Report from our newspaper] When the council held a meeting yesterday, there were several petitioners: (1) More than twenty members of the silver shop industry went to the meeting in the afternoon to petition against the government's gold jewelry processing measures promulgated on February 20: "Order all gold jewelry that has been manufactured to be registered within one week, and order it to be sold within March, otherwise it must be exchanged for national currency at the local central bank or its authorized bank", requesting amendments. Yan Gesheng and Zhu Yae, two councilors, received them and promised to submit them for discussion before forwarding them to the Municipal Government and the Executive Yuan.

In addition, Xu Jiqing, Jiang Pingfan, and 48 others temporarily proposed: Please the Ministry of Finance quickly amend the gold jewelry processing measures to maintain the silver shop business and the livelihood of all employees. It is said that there are 250 silver shops in the city, employing no less than tens of thousands of people, whose livelihoods are on the verge of ruin. The government has not yet come up with a supplementary solution, which does not seem to be in line with the intention of caring for the difficulties of businesses and the livelihoods of all people. Therefore, it is proposed that the Ministry of Finance issue an order to abolish the regulations on time-limited registration, time-limited sales, and obtaining authorization letters in the exchange measures in the gold jewelry processing measures. In addition, please the Ministry of Finance, without hindering the principle of emergency economic processing measures, appropriately relax the scope of business for silver shops. For any major changes in regulations, the opinions of the silver shop industry must be sought in advance. In addition, there were also (2) a petition issued by all the employees of the horse carriage industry, requesting that horse carriage traffic be restored in the central district to reduce the congestion of trams and solve the livelihood of carriage drivers. (3) The rickshaw trade union expressed its opposition to the Municipal Government's collection of road maintenance fees. (4) Self-funded students requested that foreign exchange be calculated at 3350. (5) The catering industry requested that the starting point for the table tax apply to restaurants that serve noodles and have music equipment.

### Index Issue to be Discussed Today

[Report from our newspaper] City councilor Shui Xiangyun and others, in order to take into account the livelihoods of employees, suggested that the central government unfreeze the workers' cost of living index starting in April. However, according to reporters' inquiries with relevant municipal government personnel yesterday, it is said that this matter is difficult to achieve. Workers in the city are generally satisfied with the newly ordered additional subsidy of 73,000 yuan, so it is difficult to immediately request a change in policy at this time. However, how this case will be resolved will be discussed at today's meeting.

### Proposal to Establish a Wharf Warehouse District in the Southern City; Decided to Ask the Two Bureaus to First Conduct Detailed Planning

[Report from our newspaper] Among the proposals discussed by the council yesterday, regarding the "Revitalizing the Southern City to Develop Port Affairs, Proposing to Establish a 'Wharf Warehouse District in the Southern City' in order to promote prosperity and facilitate shipping", the councilors also put forward their opinions. First, Public Utilities Bureau Director Zhao Zengjue explained: Wharves and warehouses should be connected to facilitate the unloading and transportation of goods. The original intention is very correct. In the future, it is planned to move the tram tracks into Limalu (Inner Road), and the outer road will be the warehouse district, which will help to promote prosperity. Pudong will also be planned according to this principle. The reason for starting with the Southern City first is to create a model.

Qu Yue expressed his opposition to this, stating: If a warehouse district is built along Pudong, the area will become a dead zone. Therefore, if you want to demarcate a warehouse, it should be within the Southern Wharf, such as the Bansongyuan area, otherwise it will lock up the Southern City's market, and there will be no hope of restoring trams. Yang Guanbei said: The warehouse district does not mean canceling existing shops, but rather expanding the original wharves. The Southern City is a natural warehouse district, and the shops are all on Limalu. If the Southern City Wharf is not reorganized, it will never develop, and shops will not be added. Wang Bingquan also agreed with Yang Guanbei, saying that it is not easy to build a wharf warehouse district in the Southern City, and there will be many disputes. It would be better to ask the military agencies there to relocate for reconstruction. Finally, the council agreed with the chairman's opinion: "This case will be handed over to the Public Works and Public Utilities Bureaus for detailed planning, and then submitted to the joint meeting of the Public Works and Public Utilities Committees for review and submission to the third meeting of the council."

Recently, many sundries have been piled up. Last night, sparks from the incense in the temple, due to careless cooking, were left behind, nearly causing a major disaster.

### Clearing Feces, Inviting Merchants to Contract, It Is Difficult for the Municipal Government to Manage Effectively, It Is Better to Contract with Merchants for More Revenue

Yesterday, the second general meeting of the Senate discussed many proposals, and the final discussion on the issue of handling feces sparked a war of words. Director of the Health Bureau Zhang Wei was severely criticized by the senators at the previous general meeting two months ago for the case of garbage trucks engaging in private malfeasance. Unfortunately, yesterday, he became the target of criticism again due to the feces issue.

Because the Health Committee of the Senate submitted a letter from the Municipal Government for review on "Inviting Merchants to Contract for Clearing Feces in This City," it was submitted to the general meeting for discussion yesterday. Lu Jingzhou advocated adopting merchant contracting for clearing feces, because it is beneficial to sanitation management on the one hand and can increase municipal revenue on the other. Qu agreed with this, but Jiang Huaisu, Jiang Hao, Wang Naixu, Zhang Zhongyuan, Lu Shidao, and others disagreed, all advocating that it should be handled by the Municipal Government itself. Why should merchants be allowed to profit and exploit, regarding feces as equivalent to ten thousand taels of gold?" As a result, Director Zhang was asked to report the reasons for wanting to invite merchants to contract. Director Zhang explained that this matter had been discussed ten times in the Sanitation and Cleaning Committee, and the result was that contracting with merchants was more economical, hygienic, and appropriate than handling it themselves. He personally also agreed in principle with handling it themselves, but regardless of whether it was handled by the Municipal Government or contracted with merchants, the "de-epidemic fermentation composting" method should be adopted. However, if the Municipal Government were to handle this institution, it would cost at least 200 billion yuan, which the Municipal Government cannot currently afford. As for contracting with merchants, the Municipal Government's monthly income would be at least 33 million and up to 460 million yuan. The bureau is currently planning to negotiate a draft contract with merchants, which also specifies that the scientific method of "de-epidemic fermentation composting" should be adopted. Recently, it is planned to invite experts in field feces to guide the handling of this new facility, but whether merchants can invest a large amount of money cannot be guaranteed. If the senators can come up with an appropriate solution, the bureau will do its best.

Wang Jian'e rose and stated, roughly saying that the cleaning problem is certainly important, but it is still unknown what the advantages and disadvantages of contracting with merchants are. Therefore, before clarifying the truth, he advocated handing it over to the competent authorities of the Municipal Government to study the situation and methods in detail before discussing it again.

At this point, Mayor Wu took the stage to speak, saying that he also agreed with the proposal to remove feces. However, because he had researched it extensively in the past, he found many shortcomings and currently has no remedies. After discussing with the Sanitation and Cleaning Committee, he still advocated contracting with merchants, but he felt that there were still imperfections. Therefore, he asked the general meeting to make a public decision. There are two reasons why the Municipal Government cannot achieve self-management: (1) The treatment of personnel is too low, so it is impossible to strengthen management, resulting in feces trucks leaking without anyone caring, and the loading and transportation are troublesome, so they are poured into the gutter, and even after investigation and punishment, it is useless. (2) If the Municipal Government manages it themselves, the current malpractices are more numerous than those of contractors. Contractors manage it as if every drop is gold, and the cleaning is thorough. In addition, the Municipal Government's income is also higher after contracting with merchants.

Finally, Speaker Pan stated: Clearing yellow feces was originally handled by the Municipal Government itself and was not approved by the Senate. Now the Municipal Government wants to change it to merchant management, which is changing its established methods on its own. Today, we can first vote. The result is that the majority supports the Municipal Government changing the current method (that is, contracting with merchants by the Municipal Government). At this point, many different opinions were raised on how to contract with merchants, but no results were achieved. In the end, only the principle of "contracting with merchants" was passed.

### Grain Loan Case Opens for Third Trial, Xu Jiqing and Xi Yushu, Two Witnesses, Fail to Appear Due to Other Matters, Prosecutor Asks to Pay Attention to Whether There Are Any Defendants Who Can Be Saved

[Our Newspaper's Report] The grain loan case opened for the third time at the Changdi Court yesterday. The witnesses Xu Jiqing and Xi Yushu, who were summoned, failed to appear because the Municipal Senate was in session. The prosecutor's argument stated roughly: If any of the eight defendants in this case have violated ordinary criminal regulations and are eligible for amnesty, please pay attention to the presiding judge and change the articles of indictment. However, regarding the first defendant, Wang Xunzhi, he leaked gold secrets when he was the deputy director of the National Treasury in Chongqing, which was related to the first gold rush. He also engaged in dereliction of duty and corruption while serving as the director of the Tobacco Monopoly Bureau in Hangzhou. Moreover, his methods of committing crimes were clever, so please pay special attention to the presiding judge. It was also said that the grain officials, including Da Ren, Ren Xingya, as the responsible personnel for grain loans, either attributed the major events in the case to orders from superiors or shifted responsibility to the grain merchants. Please, the presiding judge, severely punish them according to the law.

The statements of the eight defendants, Wang Xunzhi, Zhuang Hanzhang, Wu Rongsheng, Wan Molin, Xing Zhigang, Yang Run, Wang Daren, and Ren Xingya, were roughly the same as in the previous two trials. The interrogation of witness Shao Jigao also yielded no new discoveries. Wang Xunzhi made some corrections to the prosecutor's argument, stating roughly that the Chongqing gold rush occurred in 1944, but he had left the post of deputy director of the National Treasury as early as July 1943. The case of the Monopoly Bureau was also found to be a misunderstanding.

Finally, the defense lawyers for Wang Xunzhi, Zhuang Hanzhang, Wu Rongsheng, and Zhu Daren all requested that the defendants be released on bail, but the collegiate bench ruled to reject the request and returned them to custody.

### "Foreign Tiger" Investigation Completed, Transferred to the District Court Today

[Our Newspaper's Report] The case of Meisbo, the Dutch general manager of EBS Company, and Portuguese employee Babi Tiestai, who were engaged in large-scale black market trading of gold, US dollars, and foreign exchange, after being arrested by the Garrison Headquarters, the interrogation and investigation of the company's accounts have come to an end. The Inspection Office has scheduled to transfer the entire case to the District Court this morning, to be severely punished according to the law for disrupting the financial market and violating our country's emergency economic measures. According to relevant sources, regardless of the amount of gold and dollars EBS Company bought and sold before and after this gold rush, it is already disrupting the financial market and violating the emergency economic measures. Even in terms of its foreign exchange business, according to our country's laws, only the Central Bank and its designated banks have the right to buy and sell foreign exchange. EBS Company has not registered with the Ministry of Finance or the Ministry of Economic Affairs. Its nature is no different from that of an underground bank, which is illegal. Therefore, Meisbo's guilt is conclusive and he will have no way to escape.

### Shanghai Bao Automobile Company Controls Traffic, Prosecutor Goes to Qibao to Examine Corpse, Driver of Company Car Beaten, Two Employees Detained and Interrogated According to Law

[Our Newspaper's Report] Prosecutor Liang Gengsheng of the District Procuratorate, along with forensic doctor Jiang Ziwei, clerk Yang Shiqing, and others, went to Qishizhen in the suburbs yesterday morning to examine a corpse in a case. Because they needed the family of the deceased and local security guards to lead the way, in addition to the official car of the District Procuratorate in which Prosecutor Liang and others were riding, they hired a company car from Zhonghua Automobile Company for the security guards to ride in. The two cars arrived at Qishizhen at the same time around 11:00 AM. Unexpectedly, after getting off the car, Wang Guanlin, Bao Ruian, and others, employees of the Shanghai Bao Automobile Company in the area, gathered a crowd on the pretext to beat Chen Guoxiang, the driver of the Zhonghua Automobile Company, causing him injury. According to Prosecutor Liang's investigation with local residents, the Shanghai Bao Automobile Company has historically relied on local evil forces to control the traffic between Shanghai and Qibao, not allowing any taxi to enter. Even tourists from the city who ride bicycles are often obstructed, and beatings have occurred in the past. After hearing this, Prosecutor Liang was furious and decided to eliminate these local bullies to facilitate travel. He ordered the local security guards to take Wang Guanlin and Bao Ruian into custody and submitted a signed report to the chief prosecutor to file an indictment automatically. According to Wang and Bao's confession, the manager of the Shanghai Bao Automobile Company is named Wu Jianzhong. The District Procuratorate will summon him for investigation, and if there are any illegal facts, a public prosecution will be filed according to law.

### Two Traitor Cases Open Investigation Court, Wang Yongqing Claims to Be a Comrade Who Suffered, Han Weiwen Denies Colluding with Japanese Bandits

[Our Newspaper's Report] The High Court opened an investigation court yesterday to try two cases of suspected traitors. (1) Wang Yongqing was accused of serving in the Detective Section of the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau during the enemy-puppet period. In July 1944, he was promoted to plainclothes police chief of the Judicial Section of the Putuo Road Police Branch Bureau and also served as the head of the French Concession Special Task Force of the Puppet Special Agent Headquarters. The case was tried in the High Court yesterday. Duan Zhenming, the deputy director of the Changshou Road Branch Bureau of the Police Bureau, testified that the defendant's service in a puppet position was true. Wang Yongqing claimed that he was a comrade who suffered. In February 1939, he was arrested by the enemy for transporting explosives for the National Salvation Army and imprisoned in Nanjing Prison. He asked to summon a Shanghai senator and Ma Yuanfang, who also suffered at the same time, to testify, and submitted a calligraphy scroll given to him by Ma Yuanfang in prison for the court's reference. (2) Han Weiwen, 62 years old, from Shanghai, was accused of serving as an inspector specialist in the Puppet Shanghai Municipal Construction Bureau after the fall of Shanghai, contacting Japanese bandits, and signing travel permits for passengers between Shanghai and Hangzhou, extorting them on the pretext, and accumulating a wealth of money. He was arrested by the Zhejiang Provincial Security Command and sent to the High Court in this city. During yesterday's trial, the report firmly denied the two points in the indictment about "contacting Japanese bandits." Both cases need to be investigated, and the court ordered a rescheduling of the trial.

In the spring of 1942, he used the enemy's puppet power to organize the Puppet Suzhou Tobacco Joint Management Office, which had more than 300 members, and served as its chairman, collecting handling fees from the members. It was disbanded in March 1944. On this basis, he established a commercial bank, with Zhang serving as the chairman.

Victory Over American Soldiers' Tall Formation
China United Defeats Columbus
41 to 35 Victory by Six Points
American Soldiers Refuse to Accept Defeat, Rematch Tomorrow

[Report from Our Newspaper] In the friendly basketball match between China United and the U.S. Marine Corps Columbus, the five tigers of China United exhausted their efforts and fought hard for 40 minutes, finally defeating the American soldiers by a score of 41 to 35. In the first half, the American soldiers led by 22 to 21, a one-point advantage. Although it was a friendly match, fans knew that Columbus had strong power and tall stature, so the game was bound to be tense and exciting, so the city gymnasium was once again sold out. The score difference fluctuated between two or three points, and the competition was clear, fast, and not dragging, quite tense and exciting, and also China United's proud work of this session. The Columbus captain was hospitalized due to illness and did not appear, and the tallest soldier lost the commander-in-chief, inevitably reducing their strength. Because they refused to admit defeat, they decided to fight again on Sunday.

One Point Difference

The game started at 8:10. At 50 seconds, Columbus requested a timeout, which was a "tactic" to discuss countermeasures. Bruzzi made a free throw, and Ash scored, making it 3 to 0. Xue Chong and Zhen Zhong each scored, making it 6 to 3. China United's momentum was strong. Li committed a foul, and Cooper made a free throw. Xue Chong returned with a goal, and Bruzzi scored again, making it 8 to 6. Aublin committed a foul, and Xue Chong made both free throws, making it 10 to 6. China United still had the lead. Columbus's tallest player made one of one free throw (Ash), making it 11 points, starting to exceed by one point. Zhen Zhong made a free throw, making it 11 to 11. "Drinking Water" Jun fiercely took the lead again with two points, and the score rose and fell rapidly, causing great tension. Xue Chong dribbled the ball inside and scored, making it 14 to 14 again. Wu Chengzhang made a free throw, adding one point. Ash added two points (China United 15, Columbus 16). At 15 minutes, Bao Songyuan sprinted in, making it 17 to 16. Columbus replaced Bruzzi with Lesma. In the first half, Columbus won by only one point, 22 to 21.

Outsmarting American Soldiers

The Columbus captain did not attend due to surgery for illness. No. 3 Cooper was an aircraft pilot. The doctor ordered him to rest, but he was fond of activity and took the stage despite his illness. At the beginning of the second half, Xue Chong broke the record, and Whiteford refused to accept it. Li Zhenzhong scored again, and China United was chasing out by 25 to 24. Bao scored, and at the same time, the opponent committed a foul. Xue Chong continued to make contributions, making it 29 to 25. China United led by as many as four points. Li passed to Xue Chong, stealing a "cold meal", making it 33 to 29. Columbus used a diversionary tactic. Cooper showed his power under the basket. "No. 13" the tallest Croening entered the game. Cooper played until it was tied at 33 to 33. Columbus set up the tallest formation. The "No. 13" fast car made its first move, which made people look at it with admiration. China United Chengzhang and Zhenzhong were unwilling to show weakness, and the foreign soldiers were still at a disadvantage with 37 to 35. In the last three minutes, Kong Guangyi unexpectedly stood out, making great contributions. Bao made a free throw, making it 41 to 35? China United adopted a delaying tactic until the end of the game.

Football Committee Changes Regulations
Railway Association Expresses Regret

Wang Zhaohuai, chairman of the Beijing-Tianjin Railway Employees' Sports Association, said: According to the Football Committee's No. 10 notice on February 17, the association's football team played in the finals of the youth cup against Qingbai team at Yiyuan at 3 PM on the 20th of the same month. The Football Committee did not obtain the consent of the football team in advance, nor did it notify them, and changed the schedule without authorization, resulting in the team wasting time traveling back and forth. In addition, the Mayor's Cup competition has been going on since the beginning of February, and it has been going on for many days, but suddenly on the 6th of this month, it was announced that Article 22 of the Football Federation regulations did not apply to the Cup competition, causing the football teams to be at a loss. Moreover, changing the regulations halfway through is also not in compliance with the procedures. It is really regrettable that the Football Committee handles affairs sloppily.

Silk Industry Bank Table Tennis Team News

The Shanghai Silk Industry Bank Table Tennis Team was recently established. On the evening of the 6th, it had a friendly match with the Bill Exchange Office Table Tennis Team. As a result, the Silk Industry Bank won by a narrow margin of 4-3. Among them, Chen Xingji's victory over Ma Jinliang from the Bill Exchange Office was the most exciting. The Silk Industry Bank has strong players such as Ye Xuebin and Chen Xingquan. In order to exchange skills, the team welcomes other teams to have friendly matches. Team leader is Zhu Shoumin, captain is Ye Xuebin, vice-captain is Chen Xingquan, officer is Zhang Yunhe, and members are Tang Weicheng, Zhu Banhou, Chen Pengcheng, Yuan Gongliang, Bi Houji, and Lu Jiale.

Basketball Sidelines

The game between China United and the US Navy Columbus, although it was a friendly match, was also a touchstone for China United's preparation for the League Championship this season. The City Gymnasium was once again sold out, and more than 2,000 spectators watched attentively the best performance of China United this season.

The two teams were always in a hard fight. China United's net win of three goals was the largest difference in the whole game (China United once made it 33-26 in the second half, but was immediately forced to 33 each).

This game increased the confidence of China United in the future game against the Marine Corps Youth, but it is not appropriate to "learn from" it, because it is not easy to judge the advantages and disadvantages of the playing styles of Columbus and the Marine Corps Youth. Columbus is a more average team in all aspects, while the Marine Corps Youth uses a tall player of six feet four inches as the main general for offense and defense, which is a bit deformed. The Columbus team defends better than it attacks, and its shooting technique is below that of the Marine Corps Youth.

Last night, China United used Da Li, Adi, Xue Chong, Lao Bao and Kong Guangyi. The new lineup was indeed not weak. Lao Kong's passing to the other four, although not very coordinated, was very stable in controlling the ball. In the game against the Marine Corps Youth, Da Li and Lao Bao may have been fouled out five times to prevent the tall Wan Luke. Lao Kong is the ideal replacement.

To deal with tall players, the League knew that it had adopted low passing in yesterday's game, which proved effective. It can be seen that the tactics used by the League last night were implicitly aimed at dealing with the Marine Corps Youth. (Chang Nian)

Government Decides to Export One-Tenth of Yarn Produced by Each Factory to Earn Hong Kong Exchange
Selling Remaining Cotton Yarn to Obtain Hong Kong Exchange, Monthly Supply of 2,000 Pieces

[Report from Our Newspaper] Recently, regarding the Hong Kong government's request to our government to allow the export of cotton yarn to Hong Kong, and the Spinning and Weaving Control Commission's approval to sell cotton yarn, relevant parties went to Hong Kong to negotiate, and have already signed an agreement with the Hong Kong government to temporarily supply and sell 2,000 pieces per month. The first batch of 2,000 pieces has already been shipped a few days ago. It is learned that the price of yarn agreed upon by the Hong Kong government and us is based on the delivery price of HK$1,500 per piece of standard yarn with a certain count. Other counts are calculated proportionally. The types of cotton yarn are to be determined by us at our discretion, and the Hong Kong government is not allowed to choose. The Hong Kong government must also guarantee that the cotton yarn purchased will not be used for smuggling or disrupting the yarn market. According to estimates by the Hong Kong manufacturing industry, Hong Kong's monthly demand for cotton yarn is 5,000 to 10,000 pieces. However, the actual demand should not exceed 4,000 pieces. Economically, Hong Kong relies on us. Moreover, most of the manufacturing industries in Hong Kong are operated by overseas Chinese. Therefore, exporting cotton yarn to Hong Kong also implies helping overseas Chinese. Due to the shortage of cotton yarn in Hong Kong, the Hong Kong government previously ordered cotton yarn from Japan, and two batches, totaling 11,000 pieces, arrived in January of this year. The delivery price of the 20-count standard yarn of that batch of Japanese goods was pseudo-HK$1,200 per piece. After arriving in Hong Kong, the Hong Kong government resold it to the manufacturing industry at a price of HK$1,600 per piece. Now that Chinese yarn has arrived in Shanghai, it will also be resold at the same price. It is learned that in order to obtain foreign exchange, the government has decided to supply one-tenth of the total yarn produced by Shanghai's yarn factories for export. It is estimated that the total value of yarn, cloth, and other cotton textiles exported by China this year can be exchanged for approximately US$75 million. This is a major contribution of the textile industry to China's foreign exchange resources.

[United Press International, Hong Kong, 7th] The Hong Kong Department of Industry and Commerce announced on the 7th that it has ordered 200,000 bales of cotton yarn from the China Textile Corporation, which will soon be shipped to Hong Kong. This cotton yarn will be sold to various textile factories here at a preferential price. It is said that the department has signed a 16-month contract with the Chinese government, but it seems that the date of the purchase has not yet been decided. This is the first time since the war that a large amount of cotton yarn has been purchased from China.

Savings Deposits Collected by Various Banks and Bureaus
Allowed to be Invested in Purchasing Stocks
Stocks are also Allowed to be Used as Deposit Guarantee

The head office of the Bank of Communications previously petitioned the Ministry of Finance to ask whether savings deposits collected by various banks and bureaus could be invested in purchasing stocks listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange, and whether the stocks could be used as security for savings deposits. It is now learned that the Bank of Communications has received a letter from the Ministry of Finance, stating that the investment of savings deposits in purchasing stocks listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange by various banks and bureaus is in compliance with Article 7, Paragraph 1 of the Savings Bank Law and Article 5 of the Savings Regulations for National Savings. It can be handled accordingly, but it should still be handled in accordance with the provisions of Article 8, Paragraph 1 of the Savings Bank Law. As for the use of the above-mentioned stocks as security for savings deposits, it is also in compliance with the provisions of Article 9 of the Savings Bank Law, and the price should be calculated at 50% of the market price at the time of deposit. After reporting to the joint board meeting of the four banks for approval, the Bank of Communications has notified various banks and bureaus accordingly.

Foreign Stocks Do Not Break Out of Consolidation

Foreign stocks initially declined and then rebounded yesterday, without breaking out of consolidation. Rubber stocks were still being absorbed by Jewish merchants, and Chengfu was still strong. Huidejian was firm and consistent. Yisha's low price was 18,000 yuan and the high price was 19,400 yuan. After rising, there was consolidation. As a result, steel and rubber stocks were flat compared to the previous closing, while the rest rose slightly, up to half a weak percent.

Bond Market Gradually Stabilizes

There were still no widespread transactions in public bonds yesterday. People's hearts have gradually stabilized. After initially declining, they gradually rose. Class A and B bonds started from 5,200 yuan, Class C bonds started from 7,700 yuan, Class D bonds started from 5,600 yuan, and Unification E bonds started from 5,800 yuan. All ended with high-priced buying orders. As a result, each recovered by about 500 yuan compared to the previous closing, with transactions of only a few hundred thousand yuan.

Yarn Market Transactions are Few

Yarn market transactions were sparse and prices were flat yesterday. Customers have not yet taken action, and there is a possibility of decline. However, because the yarn value is only equivalent to the cost of yarn factories, yarn factories are unwilling to sell more, and the Spinning and Weaving Construction Commission only distributes one or two pieces to each household. People in the industry are unwilling to sell cheaply because it is not easy to replenish, resulting in a stalemate in market prices. There are not many transactions on the market, and most can abide by the price limit.

Also, it is reported that the China Spinning and Weaving Construction Corporation sold a total of 1,421 pieces of yarn on behalf of the Spinning and Weaving Control Commission yesterday, including 1,070 pieces from yarn factories and 351 pieces from trading houses. There were a total of 1,011 applicants, including 704 yarn factories and 307 trading houses.

Manufacturing Industry Applies to Purchase Cotton Yarn
Limited to Own Needs

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Spinning and Weaving Control Commission recently replied to the Manufacturing Industry Association: In the future, the industry's purchase of cotton yarn should be limited to its own needs. If it applies to purchase yarn that is not needed by itself, it will not only not be allocated, but the applicant will also be suspected of hoarding. In addition, the yarn purchased by the industry in the future must not be resold on the market, and it will be corrected if discovered.

Many People Seek to Sell Cotton Cloth
Prices are Lower Than Previous Days

The cotton cloth market situation yesterday was that at the beginning of the morning, due to the close supervision of the Jingjian Group, people were very worried, and many who held goods were anxious to sell. The opening price of 12-pound Longtou fine cloth was 159,000 yuan, which was reduced to 156,000 yuan. Later, it was heard that the Chinese-made Dyeing and Weaving Factory frequently favored 20-count extra-fine cloth, and some people in the industry bought it at low prices, so the Longtou fine cloth finally rose to 158,000 yuan, which was 2,000 yuan less than the previous day. Wufu was 154,000 yuan, and Lanji was 152,000 yuan, which was 2,000 to 4,000 yuan less. The bleached cloth market did not move, and it was stable. Colored cloth and Shilin cloth were both stable.

Rayon Prices Rebound Higher

Rayon rebounded and rose again yesterday, because silk merchants' distribution of silk was not enough to meet demand, and they scrambled to absorb it from the black market, resulting in higher asking prices. The highest asking price for 120-count Kosan Yuguang was 7.4 million yuan. Receipts for 300,000 yuan in the morning were traded at 200,000 yuan in the afternoon, which was 300,000 yuan higher than the previous day. The factory silk market was quiet, with no transactions. Qian Jing bought ten units from the Meiya Silk Factory yesterday, and the price was 5.65 million to 5.7 million yuan. Due to sluggish actual sales of silk goods, the market was mostly tired and fell yesterday. Dachang quilt was sold for 3.8 million yuan, and plaid was asked for 17,000 yuan, but there were no transactions, and the situation in the market was unusually deserted.

Quality of Our Country's Export Tea Must Be Excellent

Yesterday, a tea exporter said: Tea leaves, which occupy an important position in the international market, although it has been almost two years since the victory, exports have not been continuous because the domestic and foreign selling prices are very different. And most of the products exported in recent years are some old teas that have been stored for many years, taking advantage of their relatively low prices. However, overseas customers have repeatedly called, mentioning that the Chinese tea that arrived there, except for a few that were of good quality and have now been sold out, the rest are still shelved due to their strong moldy smell. Looking at this situation, if Chinese tea merchants do not wake up in the future, the long-standing reputation of Chinese tea in the international market may gradually be lost.

Export of Green Tea is Active

The domestic tea market was still in a hibernation state yesterday, and the market situation was stable. As for foreign merchants' transactions, Zhenmei and Zhenmei green teas are still active and prosperous, and the market is consistently stable. Wuchang Tea Company and Huacha Company have adopted a policy of not refusing those with reasonable prices. In addition, for black tea that Yingzhuang is paying attention to, most of the cargo owners who are eager for funds are still selling, but the buyers are cutting prices sharply. The sellers are concerned about the cost, so they are reluctant to depreciate too much. After negotiations between the two parties, they have returned to a stalemate, and the market situation is quiet.

Jing Rice Prices Continue to Fall

Yesterday, a total of more than 10,800 stones of rice arrived in the north and south, and the store's sales were sluggish, with supply exceeding demand. Jing rice was extremely sluggish, with few buyers, and both northern and southern Jing rice continued to fall by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Baiyuan and Yinyuan trends were stable, and Xian rice was also stable.

Flour digestion was cold, falling 300 to 500 yuan, and iron skin continued to be tired by 300 to 500 yuan, and the situation still tended to be weak. Soybean cake in Shantou moved slightly, and continued to increase by 300 to 500 yuan. Yellow soybeans went away and the end of the year was active, and the price rose by 1,000 yuan.

The oil market distributed a total of 700 loads of soybean oil, distributed to the suburbs of Shanghai and the Pudong New Area, a total of 241 households, at a price of 250,000 yuan. However, the market situation was very strong due to the store's sales being very strong, and the raw oil added another 6,000 to 7,000 yuan, the clear oil rose by 10,000 yuan, and the sesame oil also increased by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan.

Mung beans' sales saw a solution, falling 3,000 to 5,000 yuan, red beans were tired by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan, and the Southeast Asian trend was not strong. Corn continued to fall, falling by another 2,000 to 3,000 yuan, red sorghum was weak, raw peanuts were flat, sesame seeds were firm, with a slight increase of 3,000 to 5,000 yuan, broad beans' zero sales turned around, tired and re-recovered, rebounding by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan, and the price of various grains saw a mixture of rises and falls.

Fresh Meat Prices Surge

[Report from Our Newspaper] The price of fresh meat rose sharply in the market yesterday, from 320,000 yuan to 390,000 yuan per market load. In addition, each market catty of ribs was 5,000 yuan, and each market catty of spareribs was 4,000 yuan, which were both about 1,000 yuan higher than the previous day. According to people in the industry, the number of pigs arriving from the source has decreased recently, and the price of raw pigs in the producing areas has also risen due to the rise in food prices.

China Farmers Bank Convenes Representatives of Silk Merchants
Discussing the Spring Cocoon Purchase Plan
Manufacturers Express Joint Cocoon Collection by Region

[Report from Our Newspaper] In order to promote this year's spring cocoon purchase plan and discuss the development of the entire silk industry, the China Farmers Bank specially invited responsible persons from 17 silk factories to talk yesterday. Wang Botian, manager of the Farmers Bank, Zhou Jiyao, deputy manager, etc., were present. Manufacturers included Wang Huanan, Xue Zukang, Song Baolin, etc. The Farmers Bank stated: (1) The issue of loan management during cocoon collection. It is quite difficult. How should it be handled in order to manage it strictly and reduce costs? (2) Last year, the government provided assistance to silk cocoon production with a low interest rate of 2%, one to solve the livelihood of silkworm farmers, and two to obtain foreign exchange for cranes for export. Now that the first goal has been achieved, the second goal needs to be strengthened this year. (3) The Farmers Bank's concern is to look forward to the price of silk cocoons, and domestic sales will still be higher than foreign sales. Therefore, it is feared that most of the silk produced this year will be below grade D. Regarding the first point of the Farmers Bank's opinion, various manufacturers stated that joint cocoon collection should be carried out by region in order to facilitate management, mutual supervision, and reduce costs. Regarding the manufacturers' opinions, the Farmers Bank stated: (1) Several units should be organized and coordinated closely. (2) The distribution should be expedited after cocoon collection to reduce costs.

Although the Buying Style of Popular Stocks is Still Strong, the Trading of Yong Yarn is Still the Most

The Chinese stock market did not break out of consolidation yesterday. Popular stocks continued to advance under the widespread buying style. The market initially appeared strong in the afternoon, but the sharp momentum soon declined. Some large investors seemed to have a tendency to rework water yarn.

The morning opened high. After the opening, there were sales of Nos. 35 and 199, while Nos. 179, 82 and 83 advanced and hovered. Nos. 35, 36, 224, 218, 211, 180, and 197 were sold.

After 11:30, the price rose to 2,870 yuan, and Nos. 85, 203, 91, and 61 took the opportunity to sell, retreating to 2,810 yuan. However, Nos. 223, 3, 218, 12, 145, 95, and 32 all absorbed together, and the closing price in the afternoon was still hovering at a high level.

At this time, Zhongsi, underwear, Xinhua, Lian'an, and Xinguang successively rose to the limit. People's hearts were still showing, Nos. 144 and 141 and others were in, and it was easy to rise back to the 2,900 yuan scene. After 3 o'clock, the popular stocks said that the momentum had greatly decreased, and the situation gradually showed relaxation. Nos. 85, 152, 223, 76, and 99 continued to supply and sell, forcing the price down to 2,780 yuan. After entering, Nos. 180, 222, 112, 198, 201, and 4 were all on the buying side, while Nos. 152, 13, 206, and 185 were selling, so the market price was always hovering between 2,800 yuan and 2,850 yuan.
