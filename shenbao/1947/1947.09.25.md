### Principles for Handling Imported Goods Purchased with Self-Provided Foreign Exchange Finalized; Awaiting Approval and Implementation by the Executive Yuan's Provisional Meeting

[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper in Nanjing, 24th] The handling measures for imported goods purchased with self-provided foreign exchange were previously discussed in detail at the Executive Yuan meeting. On the 24th, the Executive Yuan convened a special review subcommittee meeting involving relevant agencies. Several principles were finalized, to be submitted for discussion at the provisional Executive Yuan meeting on the 27th. Implementation will follow approval. The key points of these principles are as follows: After the government announces the regulations for the automatic declaration of overseas deposits by citizens, self-provided foreign exchange must be automatically declared to the national banks and transfer procedures completed. Following this procedure and with the approval of the national banks, imported goods can be purchased. Self-provided foreign exchange that has not been declared to the national banks will not be permitted for use. In this way, the government can control all foreign exchange. In principle, the self-provided foreign exchange used for imported goods frozen by the Shanghai Customs will be unfrozen. However, luxury items on the import ban list, such as automobiles and lipsticks, will not be allowed to be imported. Other materials specially permitted for import will be subject to heavy taxation based on the severity of the circumstances before being allowed to be imported. The meeting today was chaired by Finance Minister Yu Hung-chun. A report on the total value of the self-provided foreign exchange used for imported goods frozen by the Shanghai Customs was presented, stating that it was only US$4 million, refuting the rumor of US$100 million. Furthermore, over 70% of these goods were unlisted items such as machinery, newsprint, fertilizer, pharmaceuticals, and raw materials for the film industry. The Ministry of Finance has proposed a tax rate of 50% to 100%. The discussions at today's meeting were based on the provisions of Article 9 of the "Regulations for the Management of Import and Export Trade," which states that "importers must not engage in ordering goods from abroad before obtaining an import permit." Therefore, a decision was made on how to handle importers who directly order goods from abroad using self-provided foreign exchange, as described above.

### Increased Allocation of Compensation Materials to Private Institutions

[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper in Nanjing, 24th] It is reported that the compensation materials allocated to private institutions have been increased from the original 32,000 tons to 120,000 tons. The detailed allocation method will be decided at a meeting in the near future.

[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper in Nanjing, 24th] The Compensation Committee held a meeting at 3:00 PM on the 24th to discuss increasing the amount of compensation materials allocated to private institutions. Chairman Wang Yun-wu presided over the meeting, with Gan Nai-guang, Qin Fen, and others in attendance. During the meeting, it was noted that the originally requested 480,000 tons might not be fully met due to the adoption of a lottery method. Due to the reduction in the total amount, the originally determined allocations to various units, especially the materials allocated to private factories, would be reduced. It was deemed necessary to allocate a portion of the materials to be distributed to various government agencies. The meeting decided that the Review Committee should convene the Ministry of Transportation, the National Resources Commission, the Ministry of National Defense, and other agencies to jointly discuss this matter.

### President Zhang Inspects the Shijingshan Steel and Power Plant Yesterday and Listens to Work Reports from Hebei and Beiping

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 24th] President Zhang Qun attended the morning meeting of the Beiping Municipal Government at 7:45 AM on the 24th. In his address to the municipal government personnel, he stated that Beiping is not only a historical city where culture and civilization converge but also the spiritual capital of the Chinese people today. However, due to the people of Beiping's historical habit of stability, they tend to be somewhat passive. He encouraged everyone to strive for legalism and pragmatism, and to promote public virtue. "Legalism" means knowing and abiding by the law, while "pragmatism" means speaking truthfully, doing practical work, and having a sincere and down-to-earth approach. Revitalizing morale and promoting public virtue is the shared responsibility of officials and the public. The New Life Movement advocated by President Chiang Kai-shek in the past is a shortcut to promoting public virtue. Recently, the government has promulgated austerity measures, aiming to use government orders to supervise the implementation of the New Life Movement. The municipal government, as the executor of government orders, bears an even greater responsibility. He hoped that the municipal government personnel would encourage each other and work together to achieve the goal of building Beiping. After the address, accompanied by Director Li Zongren of the Executive Yuan, Vice Chairman Sun Yueqi of the National Resources Commission, and Political Commissioner Peng Xuepei, he went to the North China Iron and Steel Plant of the National Resources Commission and the power plant of the North Hebei Electric Power Company in Shijingshan, west of Beiping, at 9:00 AM for inspection. Director Zhu Yulun of the steel plant and General Manager Bao Guobin of the North Hebei Electric Power Company led the tour and explained the internal organization. President Zhang inquired extensively about the reconstruction work of the two plants and promised to consider ways to solve the various difficulties. He returned to the city at 1:30 PM in the afternoon. From 3:00 PM to 7:00 PM, he listened to work reports from the Hebei Provincial Government and the Beiping Municipal Government. At 7:30 PM in the evening, he attended a banquet hosted by Director Li. On the 24th, he inspected Yenching University and Tsinghua University in the morning, and attended a welcome reception organized by various agencies and organizations in the afternoon. After the meeting, he planned to host professors from colleges and universities. He will leave Beiping for Tianjin on the 26th.

[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper in Beiping, 24th] President Zhang attended the work report meeting of the municipal government at 6:00 PM on the evening of the 24th. Director Zeng of the Bureau of Education presented plans to President Zhang regarding the relief of out-of-school youth, improving teachers' salaries, increasing funding, and repairing school buildings.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 24th] Huang Xian-guang, Director of the Executive Yuan's Information Bureau, stated at a press conference on the 24th in response to reporters' questions: "President Zhang's current tour of the north aims to inspect and inquire about the suffering of the people, and to examine whether local governments are thoroughly implementing national policies and government orders and whether their work is coordinated. He will also inspect industrial and mining enterprises. President Zhang himself has explained the purpose. However, President Zhang's trip to the Northeast before going to Beiping and Tianjin indicates the government's special emphasis on the Northeast, as the Northeast is the most precious and cherished part of our entire territory."

[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper in Guihua, 24th] President Zhang may come to Suiyuan in the future, and preparations for his welcome are underway here.

### Military and Official Supervisory Group Sends Letter to President Zhang Requesting Assistance in Rectification Work

[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper in Beiping, 24th] The members of the Military and Official Supervisory Group visited President Zhang this morning but did not meet him. They then sent a letter to President Zhang, explaining the group's past work and requesting Zhang's active assistance in the group's work. They requested that the measures for improving military discipline and rectification previously submitted to the central government be implemented and requested instructions for judicial organs to strictly handle the cases already investigated by the group.

### Chen Cheng Hosts Banquet for Provincial and Municipal Leaders in Shenyang Official Residence

[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper in Changchun, 24th] Chen Cheng convened a meeting with provincial and municipal leaders of the unrecovered areas in Shenyang at 6:00 PM yesterday to discuss the issue of advancing offices to areas close to the unrecovered territories. Several agencies in Changchun are already seeking sites for offices.

[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper in Shenyang, 24th] After the resignation of Changchun Mayor Zhao Jun, Sun Gui-ji, the current mayor of Lushun, has been internally designated as his replacement and will be officially announced soon.

### Nomination of Candidates; Various Parties Consult Separately

Youth Party Denies Conditional Nomination

[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper in Nanjing, 24th] The three-party consultation on the nomination of candidates by political parties did not take place on the 24th. The Democratic and Youth Parties have been holding internal meetings every night for several days to discuss the nomination issue. Kuomintang members are scheduled to meet at Sun Ke's residence on the 25th to discuss the matter, with a follow-up meeting on the 26th.

[Report from This Newspaper] According to Youth Party sources: "Negotiations on opening up local government positions are still ongoing in Nanjing. The Youth Party has made requests for positions such as department heads, commissioners, county magistrates, and middle school principals. However, the rumor of demanding a chairman position is likely untrue. As for the number and scope of requests, there was a past agreement of '3:1:1.' This principle should apply not only to the central government but also to local governments. However, opening up local government positions and submitting a list of candidates for the general election are two separate matters. Therefore, the claim that the list was rejected due to unmet demands is not credible."

[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper in Guihua, 23rd] In the election of Mongol banners and Chinese people, the central government allows the right to vote but not the right to be elected. It is reported that there are 200,000 Chinese people in the seven banners of the Yikezhao League in Suiyuan, while there are only 20,000 Mongol people. The Chinese people in each banner are brewing a boycott of the election.

### The Work of the British Friends Service Unit in China

[British Information Services, London, 24th] Mr. Johnstone recently published an article, "The Work of the Friends Service Unit," which provides a detailed review of British aid organizations in China. The article states: "With the global war having ended, the emergency situation in China caused by the war has been partially alleviated. Consequently, the Friends Ambulance Unit in China ended in March 1946. After a meeting to continue the project of this organization until the autumn of 1946, the 'Friends Service Unit to China' was formally established. Its organization is similar to the Friends Ambulance Unit, and its members share the same views on peace and war as members of the Quaker Church. It is also a volunteer organization. Each member must have language training and receive a stipend for separate use, and must work in the field for at least two years. Currently, the unit's work has three major categories: medical relief, post-war reconstruction, and training and education. A type of black fever is prevalent in North China, which is transmitted by sandflies and can cause fever and death in malnourished people within one to two weeks. The Service Unit is working independently in a part of Henan Province. A diagnostic team consisting of one British public health physician and two experimental technicians travels from village to village in the area to identify patients, followed by a treatment team that provides patients with the necessary injections. The purpose of this work is to systematically eliminate black fever from a large area, so that there is no fear of sandflies spreading it. Other medical work is carried out in small hospitals, supplemented by a relief program that includes the establishment of kindergartens and people's education classes, the distribution of milk to children, and some preliminary hygiene, the promotion of cooperative enterprises such as cotton planting, flour milling, oil pressing, and sawmilling, and the gradual teaching of new varieties of plants and animals and improved breeding methods. Regarding its third category of work, two projects have been implemented for several months. One is a medical mechanical training school, with courses in basic hospital engineering and maintenance, water supply, plumbing, and sanitation, and protection of generators and electric light lines. The other is the provision of two members to teach at Shanghai University, one national and one church-run, to provide opportunities for mutual contact with the Shanghai Friends Service Center."

### Shamian Concession in Guangzhou to be Developed as Cultural District; Municipal Government Establishes Cultural Committee for Planning

[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper in Guangzhou, 24th] The Guangzhou Shamian Concession, which we have recovered, has a tranquil construction and beautiful scenery. The Guangzhou Municipal Government has decided to designate the area as a Guangzhou cultural district and has established a Cultural Affairs Committee to be responsible for designing, reviewing, awarding, and managing public cultural undertakings and funds.

### Executive Yuan Instructs Three Principles for Restoring Trade with Korea; First Ascertain Attitudes of US and South Korea, Then Formulate Detailed Measures

[Special Dispatch from This Newspaper in Nanjing, 24th] Regarding the restoration of trade with Korea, the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission previously received repeated joint petitions from representatives of overseas Chinese in Korea, including Zhou Shen-jiu. The Commission has successively sent letters to the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and other relevant agencies for handling. The Executive Yuan has now issued a telegram approving the following three principles: 1. It is indeed necessary to consider opening up Sino-Korean trade. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs should first ascertain the attitudes and policies of both the United States and South Korea within a set period, and then formulate detailed measures for navigation and trade to adapt to the situation. 2. All goods belonging to overseas Chinese in Korea that have been detained and fall under the category of temporarily suspended imports should be released upon payment of supplementary taxes. 3. Before the official opening of Sino-Korean trade, overseas Chinese in Korea who continue to apply for importing goods in the future, except for those listed as prohibited imports, should be allowed to declare customs and pay taxes for release. Exports will be temporarily suspended. The Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission has forwarded these measures to major overseas Chinese organizations in Korea for their information. The Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission believes that, standing from the perspective of the interests of overseas Chinese, the ban on Sino-Korean trade should be lifted as soon as possible, and regular relations should be restored.

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 23rd] According to personnel from the Industry Group of the Allied General Headquarters in Japan, seven Japanese-made locomotives, forty-two freight cars, and two boilers will be shipped to China in the near future. Another twenty locomotives are under construction and are expected to be completed between December and March next year. Part of the former has been packaged and will be shipped to China by sea within a few days. However, due to the fact that China and Japan have not yet agreed on the final price of the railway equipment, the loading may be delayed. This railway equipment includes seven locomotives of two different types, ten flatbed freight cars, and thirty-two other types of freight cars. The former Chinese representative in Tokyo went to inspect these vehicles and found that their quality was inferior to the points listed in the Chinese specifications. According to headquarters personnel, all shortcomings have now been corrected one by one according to Chinese suggestions. The other twenty locomotives under construction are part of the 300 locomotives and 3,000 freight cars that China and Japan negotiated and ordered a year ago. According to the production plan, Japan will be able to produce five locomotives per month from December to March next year.

### American Reporter Travels in Shandong and Reveals the Mysteries of the Chinese Communist Party

American Scripps-Howard newspaper reporter W. H. Newton sent a dispatch from Shandong County on September 9, describing a glimpse of the recent situation in the Communist-controlled areas. The original text is translated as follows:

"Visiting many contested cities and war zones damaged by war in China, and talking to soldiers and ordinary people, allows us to uncover several mysteries about the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese National Government.

"The first mystery: the assumption that the Communist Party is probably very popular with ordinary Chinese people, poor farmers and villagers. But the fact is: as far as the territory in Shandong is concerned, the Communist Party is not only greatly feared by the rich, but also greatly feared by the poor.

"For example, Yidu, which was occupied by the Communist Party for the past six months, saw all commercial activity cease, all shops close, and church schools and hospitals sealed off during the occupation. A large number of people fled elsewhere. This situation is the same in Linchu and many other villages!

"The second mystery! The assumption that the Communist Party army is the "people's army," meaning that it is the common farmer's resistance to the National Government. I have spoken to many Communist prisoners of war captured by the Kuomintang in the Battle of Linchu, and almost none of them understand the meaning of "communism." Most of them were forced to join and forced to fight. A small number of them were originally Kuomintang soldiers who were captured in previous battles and forced to fight against the government.

"The third mystery: the assumption that the Communist Party allows any degree of religious freedom in the areas they control. This is only the exception in those few cities with foreign missionaries, because they may report the situation. But even in these cases, religious rituals are hindered and Chinese pastors are persecuted and humiliated.

"Chinese Presbyterian and Baptist pastors are often accused of being "American spies" and deported. Catholics, in general, are particularly persecuted.

"For example, in Chinchik, the Communist Party stormed into a Catholic church, took away everything of value, and compensated the German priest about five US cents for the damage. In Changchia, the Chinese Presbyterian pastor was forced to flee and their homes were destroyed at will.

"Communist political instructors in Changtuan collected Bibles distributed by the Presbyterian pastor and burned them. In Shawo, the Communist Party tried to force the Presbyterian pastor to order the church's clergy to attend Communist Party meetings; he refused. Of the fifty Presbyterian churches in the Weixian area, only four—those in the Kuomintang area—can still worship freely.

"In all the villages and towns in northern Shandong Province, Christian pastors have been imprisoned by the Communist Party.

"The fourth mystery: the assumption that the attractive land reform plan has won the farmers' inclination towards the Communist Party. It is true that the Communist Party confiscated the land of the landlords and distributed it to the farmers on several occasions, but then, the Communist Party imposed heavy taxes on them, requisitioned all the harvests to feed the Communist Party's army, and forced the farmers who accepted the land to join the army.

"There is little respect for political freedom and human rights anywhere in China, and in the Communist Party areas, there is absolutely no respect for political freedom and human rights, except occasionally in some "show places" that allow foreigners to visit.

"Although the Communist Party leaders are completely ruthless in pursuing their political goals, they are generally less traditional in their corrupt practices than the officials of the National Government. However, there are obvious exceptions to this criticism of National Government officials.

"One of the exceptions is Major General Chang Tien-tso, Commissioner of the Eighth Administrative District of Shandong. General Chang is 40 years old, a tall and cheerful figure. With the entire Eighth Administrative District under Communist Party control, General Chang organized a cooperative relief committee, chartered airplanes, brought in supplies, and transported out local products. Merchants transporting goods out of the territory are taxed according to the value of the goods, and the proceeds are used to maintain the lives of the millions of refugees who have fled from the Communist Party army.

"He organized a school for middle-aged women to teach them hygiene and basic medical knowledge. He collected textbooks and opened rural primary schools in the district. He obtained DDT to kill pests in the countryside. The Communist Party has never been able to step into the villages he manages. The Jiaoji Railway, which passes through his area, has never been sabotaged by Communist guerrillas; it is the only remaining section that can still operate daily, about 40 kilometers.

"It is true that the Kuomintang army also levies taxes on the villages when passing through. This seems to be a cruel necessity for both sides of the war. However, in Shandong Province, at least, when the Communist Party captures a city, the people flee, and when the Kuomintang recovers it, the people return.

"The Communist Party's propaganda often sounds very good, but this is the reality!"

### Preliminary Agreement Reached Between China and the United States for $30 Million in Relief Supplies; 50,000 Tons of British Bridge Equipment Shipped to China

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 24th] Ministry of Foreign Affairs News: The draft agreement on U.S. aid supplies to China has been under continuous discussion by representatives from the Ministry and the U.S. Embassy for several days and has reached a preliminary agreement. Both parties are requesting government approval. According to the agreement, the U.S. intends to provide China with relief in the form of food, medicines, seeds, and fertilizers, totaling approximately $30 million, with food accounting for the largest portion.

[British News Agency, London, 24th] When the current restoration plan is fully realized, 98% of China's telecommunications equipment will be supplied by the United Kingdom. Equipment such as telephones, telegraph transmitters, and broadcasting equipment will almost entirely come from the UK. The reporting machines and broadcasting equipment include facilities to reach all parts of the world, as well as equipment solely for local communication business. The above equipment was ordered from the United Kingdom through the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration after China considered and determined that British equipment was the best. The British industry has so far undertaken to deliver a large number of Chinese orders.

The assistance that the United Kingdom is supplying to China for reconstruction is not limited to telecommunications equipment. The UK is currently shipping 50,000 tons of bridge equipment to China, which is equivalent to 80% of China's total needs. Simultaneously shipped to China with the bridge equipment are two complete railway repair plants, encompassing everything from square sheds to tools, sufficient to handle the heaviest fire. In addition, there is a large batch of smaller tools capable of establishing 78 automobile repair shops.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 23rd] When reporters inquired with General Wedemeyer about his reported recommendation to President Truman that economic assistance to China be utilized under strict U.S. supervision, Wedemeyer replied that he was not at liberty to discuss the matter before his report was published. He stated that he had spoken with Secretary of State Marshall for two hours yesterday when the Secretary returned to Washington to confer with the President and senior officials. Wedemeyer continued, saying that he would meet with President Truman on the 25th. It is understood that only a summary of Wedemeyer's report will be released, and the full text will not be published.

[Reuters, New York, 23rd] Former Undersecretary of State Welles wrote in the commentary column edited by Zhang Sheng in the New York Herald Tribune, stating that the Wedemeyer fact-finding mission to China was a serious mistake. Welles stated that the CCP had called the Wedemeyer mission to China a clear demonstration of American interference in China's sovereign affairs. A dangerous rift has now occurred between Washington and Nanjing. This is the result of the Wedemeyer investigation mission to China. Welles also pointed out significant errors made by the United States in Greece, the Paris Conference, and Germany.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 23rd] World Bank Vice President Garner stated today that while the World Bank considers the economic recovery of Europe as its most important work, it is also eager to assist Latin America, Asia, and other countries. When Garner met with reporters today, he mentioned the equalization loan issue that the Chinese government had previously expressed interest in. He said that while the Bank has the right to make such loans, he could not answer reporters' questions about what actions the Bank would take regarding applications thereafter. Garner also stated that the Bank's actions would be coordinated with those of the U.S. Congress.

### Deng Wenyi Reports on Recent Military Affairs: Communist Bandits in Jiaodong Can Be Cleared Within Ten Days; Liu Bandit Already Encircled and Not Difficult to Eliminate

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 24th] Deng Wenyi, Director of the Information Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense, attended a press conference held by the Information Bureau of the Executive Yuan at 5:00 PM on the 24th, reporting on military affairs, providing explanations on the Liu Bocheng, Chen Geng, Chen Yi, and Jiaodong fronts, one by one. The Fifth Column under Liu Bocheng's command has lost more than half of its strength. After suffering heavy losses, the 1st and 7th Columns merged and are now fleeing in small groups. This unit has suffered significant ammunition losses in Guangshan and Luotian. Initially, the unit possessed 5,000 oxcarts of ammunition, but now less than half remains. Chen Geng's unit crossed the Henan River southward, originally intending to join with the northward fleeing Liu Bocheng unit, but immediately after crossing the river, it was intercepted by the National Army, preventing it from advancing. It is currently in the area east of Shanzhou and has suffered heavy losses. The 1st, 4th, and 8th Columns under Chen Yi's command crossed from western Shandong, while another unit crossed the river northward from the Jiaoji Railway. The total strength of the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 6th, 8th, 10th, and 11th Columns is no more than 40,000 men. They have lost more than half of their strength in the past two weeks. The National Army troops on the Longhai Railway have been reinforced and should not pose a problem. The Political Committee of the Third Column sent a report to Chen Yi, detailing their reluctance to fight and the lack of ammunition and food, and calling themselves the "Escapee Column," which reveals the general morale of the army. In the Jiaodong region, the National Army is intensifying its offensive, led by Xu Shiyou of the Ninth Column. We are now less than 60 kilometers from Yantai, so the Communist bandits in the Jiaodong area can be cleared within ten days. In this way, the Communist bandits have had their retreat cut off, and the bandits south of the Yellow River will also find it difficult to escape their fate of annihilation. Director Deng generally reported on city and town gains and losses from September 15th to 21st, stating: Guangji fell on the 15th, and we captured Qishui; Huangmei fell on the 16th, and we captured Yingshan; the situation in Qianshan and Susong was unclear on the 17th, and we captured Huangmei and Guangji; Guangshan and Luotian fell on the 18th, and we captured Liuan and Shucheng; on the 20th, we captured Huangshan, Guangshan, and Luotian; on the 21st, we captured Lujiang (in Anhui province); Shangcheng was relieved on the 22nd, and the situation in Gushi was unclear. The bandits have gathered 6,000 to 7,000 troops in the area between Guangshan, Jingfu, and Shangcheng. There are no large bandit forces between the Luotian highway and railway. Currently, the Liu bandit is encircled by the National Army on all sides, making it not difficult to eliminate them in the near future.

### War-Weariness, Desertion, Pessimism, and Laxity: The Tragic Fate of Chen Yi's Bandit Troops Exposed Without a Trace in the "Political Commissar" Report

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 24th] The "Political Commissar" of the Third Column of Chen Yi's Communist Bandit troops, Wang Danian, submitted a report to Chen on the "General Ideological Situation in the Army" and attitudes towards combat, consisting of over 2,000 characters in full. It was captured by our Fifth Division near Yucheng. The report fully expresses dissatisfaction with Chen Yi and phenomena of morale decline and pessimism. Records of desertions are also numerous. This is truly a "propaganda item" of a bandit army in decline. Here are some notes: Daily life consists mostly of marching, and water is encountered everywhere, so everyone has rotten feet, and there is a lack of food, often subsisting on raw sweet potatoes. There are many deserting soldiers. Since the Tenth Column went from central Shandong to the Yu-Lu area, statistics show that there have been 2,000 deserters, so it has now been downsized. Regarding the ideological situation, since the Third Column failed in the Jinning battle, due to the annihilation of five companies and the complete injury or death of seven companies, the concrete reflections after the battle include four kinds of emotions: (A) Complaining: There is widespread complaining up, down, left, and right about Commander Chen, resenting his subjectivism. Cadres at the regimental level believe that it was originally an excellent annihilation battle, but the higher-ups did not handle it well. At the same time, they complain about insufficient ammunition and poor command; they resent the political workers for boasting because during mobilization they said that as long as we surround the city, we don't necessarily have to fight into it, saying that the remnants of the 72nd Division were at most two regiments, with only three cannons, one of which couldn't even fire. (B) Pessimism: Most soldiers don't eat and look for villagers everywhere. When they see family members injured or killed, they wail and cry, or sleep like the dead all day long. Some cry and say, "Only I am left!" Some veteran soldiers eat and drink heavily, and they don't believe we can win the counteroffensive. They say that after we eliminate the 26th Division, another 26th Division comes, and after we eliminate the 72nd Division, another 72nd Division comes, so something can never be accomplished, and they are deserting in large numbers. Thirty men from the 22nd Regiment of the Eighth Division left overnight, and individual special agents took the opportunity to act, carrying machine guns and running away. (C) Laxity: Cadres ignore problems such as desertion and violations of the law. A platoon leader said that being a platoon leader and leading thirty-two soldiers on a march, he really doesn't feel like it; Yang Honghui, a political instructor in the 27th Regiment, cries loudly and doesn't ask about work. (D) Waiting for reorganization. The above four emotions are very common, and general thinking is very confused, especially expressing inclined emotions. Some people say, "If you can't beat them to death, run them to death; if you can't run them to death, starve them to death." Thirty-four members of the Fourth Company captured from the 30th Regiment organized a group and ran away with five guns, two of whom were party members. Someone said, "Counterattack, counterattack, we lost Shandong!" The Third Column calls itself the "Escapee Column" because they are being chased closely from behind; discipline in the 32nd Regiment is even worse, hitting and scolding local cadres, demanding food, civilian laborers are forced to buy things and are forced to pull livestock, and there are separate rapes, etc. According to Lai Shaoqi, discipline is too bad, there is no way to do political work, propaganda work is finished, and now we can only use heads to maintain it. Others say that Commander Chen calculated everything, but didn't calculate food and shoes for walking. Finally, he makes two requests: A clear strategic policy and Replenishment and rest. Not signed "Your Officer, Da Nian, September 13."

Commentary

### On the Ten-Year Plan for University Education

— Hu Xiansu

Hu Shi, President of Peking University, recently published his proposed ten-year education plan to the authorities, which has attracted attention from all parties. Zou Lu, a member of the National Government, concerned about Sun Yat-sen University, sent an open letter to Hu, inquiring whether the Sun Yat-sen University he mentioned was referring to National Central University or Sun Yat-sen University. Chen Xujing, Dean of Studies at Nankai University, expressed disagreement with Hu's proposal to completely abolish studying abroad. There are also many other people in the education field who have written articles discussing this issue. It can be seen that this issue is valued by all sectors of the country; therefore, I also want to express my personal opinions to discuss with the people of the country.

Hu's proposal that the government should specially cultivate the five national universities of Peking University, Tsinghua University, Zhejiang University, Wuhan University, and Central University within two five-year periods is not unreasonable. These five schools can indeed be called the best universities in the country, but to say that only these five schools are worthy of special cultivation by the government, there is room for discussion. For example, Jiaotong University has been the most famous engineering university in the country for decades, and its library and mechanical equipment are very abundant. Its academic status is no less than that of the five universities such as Peking University; isn't Jiaotong University worthy of special cultivation by the government? Sun Yat-sen University used to be the largest in scale among the national universities, with the most abundant library equipment. Its College of Agriculture and College of Medicine are quite famous, and the Institute of Agricultural and Forestry Botany, presided over by Professor Chen Huan, has long been internationally renowned as the most famous institution for studying Chinese plant taxonomy. The number of its specimens and books is second only to the Jing Sheng Biological Investigation Institute, which the five universities mentioned by Hu cannot match. Unfortunately, generally speaking, the discipline is slightly lax, and the academic atmosphere is not very strong, and in this war of resistance, the books and specimens were almost completely lost. However, this is a university commemorating Mr. Sun Yat-sen, with a large scale and a glorious history in the past. The government should actively reorganize it and cultivate it specially, making it the first-class university in southern China. I believe that in addition to these seven universities that the government declares to cultivate specially, it must also pay attention to cultivating several other universities, such as Normal University, Northeast University, Fudan University, Jinan University, Tongji University, Sichuan University, Zhongzheng University, Nankai University, Xiamen University, and Hunan University, taking those with a long history or colleges with a long-standing reputation in the past. In the first ten-year plan, the government may not have the power to cultivate these ten schools especially, but it must also enrich their teachers and library equipment to bring them up to the general level of European and American universities. As for Taiwan University, it has substantial library equipment, but it must enrich its teachers so that it can maintain its level during the Japanese management period. In addition, other universities can only be taken care of in the second ten-year plan. However, China has great potential. If politics is on track and industrialization is in progress, then national power will grow rapidly. Perhaps in less than ten years, not only will the government be able to improve other universities, but it can also add many new universities. The Soviet Union has been established for only twenty years, and there are more than 780 universities and more than 1,000 research institutes in its country. How can China be so far away from it forever? If so, how can we build a country? What about the so-called catching up?

Secondly, when talking about the ten-year university education plan, don't neglect research institutions. Hu said that universities drink thin porridge, wouldn't research institutions drink thin porridge? The Academia Sinica is the highest research institution in the country, and its funding is not abundant. The funding of the Peiping Research Institute is tight, which is even more unimaginable. Other public and private research institutions are also in a difficult situation. University funding is inherently large. In the near future, it will not be possible to establish large-scale research institutes. It is necessary to expand existing public and private research institutions as much as possible and link them closely with universities, so that within their specialized research scope, they can guide the students of university research institutes, so that universities can obtain the best senior mentors and can use the picture equipment and specimens of the research institutes without having to prepare them themselves. On the research institute side, it can also ensure that research and education are not separated, and can cultivate talents in the science that this institution specializes in research, avoiding the lament of talent shortage, so that both parties can benefit from it. This layer has not been achieved in the past. Now, the various institutes of the Academia Sinica have a proposal to cooperate with Central University. In the future, the government should actively encourage this kind of mutually beneficial cooperation.

As for the current policy on studying abroad, it is not perfect. A large number of public and private students are not fully prepared in the country, and even the preparation of foreign languages is not certain. They only plan to go abroad for gilding, wasting a lot of foreign exchange, which is unwise. However, absolutely prohibiting studying abroad, preventing students from obtaining the opportunity to conduct research that domestic universities cannot lead, in order to complete their personal learning goals and adapt to the needs of the country, is not a long-term solution. I think it is okay to impose stricter restrictions on studying abroad. Reduce the quota of public and private students by two-thirds of the current number, and stipulate that only university professors, lecturers, teaching assistants, or research institute personnel can go abroad for research; and then stipulate that the top-tier universities and public and private research institutions should enrich research equipment as soon as possible, recruit more research students, and after they have completed their studies, even let them take the national doctoral examination. Only after they have obtained a doctorate can they be sent to famous foreign universities to study for one or two years, so that those who are cultivated are truly first-class scholars and will not waste public and private wealth.

University education was quite abnormal during the Anti-Japanese War. Now that the Anti-Japanese War has been over for two years, it has not been reorganized, which is not right. The current constitution stipulates that 15% of the total national budget should be used for education, science, and culture, which must be implemented from the 37th year. On the one hand, increase a large amount of funding, and on the other hand, reduce the funding for studying abroad by two-thirds, so that universities and research institutions can be enriched as much as possible, so that they can actively improve. Then universities and public and private research institutions can complete their tasks without drinking porridge, and Chinese academics can be independent.

### Taiwan Announces Two Measures to Stop Disrupting Finance; Passengers to Guangdong and Fujian Limited to Carrying 500,000 Legal Tender

[Central News Agency, Taipei, 24th] The Taiwan Provincial Government has announced two measures regarding the financial problems it faces. This was decided before Wei Daoming went to Beijing. It is heard that there is another measure that can only be published after consulting with the Ministry of Finance. The two measures announced are: first, the Ministry of Finance stipulates that each person carrying legal tender from the mainland to the ports of Fujian and Guangdong shall not exceed 500,000; otherwise, it will be confiscated. Many merchants carry legal tender from Shanghai to Taiwan and then make profits by arbitrage, resulting in illegal black market exchange of legal tender in Taiwan Province recently, disrupting finance. The Taiwan authorities have decided to strictly stop this and have begun to inspect the amount of legal tender carried by passengers to Fujian and Guangdong at various ports in Taiwan Province. If it exceeds 500,000 yuan, the excess amount will be confiscated. The second measure is to prohibit all public and private firms engaged in the silver and money industry from engaging in deposit and loan and remittance businesses, especially public and private firms engaged in the remittance and exchange business of legal tender and Taiwan dollars, which will be strictly prohibited.

### Liang Huasheng, Pan Yukun, and Others Return to Changchun Together from Shenyang

[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 24th] Liang Huasheng, Chairman of the Jilin Provincial Government, Pan Yukun, Commander of the New First Army, and Li Hong, Commander of the 38th Division, flew back to Changchun together today.

According to their talk with our reporter: The autumn harvest is approaching, and small groups of Communist bandits are coming out to loot grain. The National Army has made arrangements to protect the autumn harvest and strive to reduce losses for farmers. The National Army's assault teams are used in coordination with strategic maneuvers, accumulating small victories into large victories, and the results are quite large. Recently, sporadic bandits in northern Changchun are purely harassing and are not worth worrying about. The safety of Changchun and the Changchun-Jilin traffic can be guaranteed.

[Our Changchun Dispatch, 24th] Liang Huasheng, Pan Yukun, and Li Hong flew back from Shenyang to Changchun together today. Liang will take the express train back to Jilin at 3:00 PM this afternoon to prepare for hosting Lu Han.

The inside was just about managing hygiene and night watchmen. Did you issue a notice to arrest communists and Central Government personnel?

Regarding the incident of tram workers being beaten by the Japanese, did you warn the tram company that special detectives would investigate and that Japanese people should not be scolded in the future?

In 1938, when you were the Mayor of Puppet Tianjin, you hired Japanese advisors. Were they hired by the Puppet City Government? (Answer) Yes. The court again instructed him not to prevaricate. In 1943, when you were the Chairman of the Puppet North China Reclamation Company, did you engage in enterprises that benefited the enemy? (Answer) The company was not an enemy or puppet organization. The court asked again, did you not know that the company had Japanese shares and was jointly operated by the Japanese and puppets? (Answer) I did not know at the time. Is there any evidence of rescuing underground workers? (Answer) Only based on conscience, there is no evidence. Why did you protect the four major cultural relics? Is there any evidence? (Answer) 1. The Ancient Relics Exhibition Hall, 2. The Palace Museum, 3. The Beijing Library, 4. The Tiananmen Exhibition Hall, there is evidence. By 5:30 PM, after three hours of strict interrogation, Pan Yugui was physically exhausted and begged for a postponement of the trial.

### UN General Assembly Passes All Agenda Items - Committees Begin Work - Elect Chairpersons and Vice-Chairpersons Respectively

(Report from This Newspaper) New York, 24th Broadcast: Success Lake Dispatch: The Trusteeship Council met at 11:00 AM this morning. The meeting was chaired by Berendsen of New Zealand, and Shmygov of Belarus was elected as Vice-Chairperson. Dousinville of Haiti was elected as spokesperson. The Economic Committee was chaired by Santa Cruz, and Bertien of the Netherlands was elected as Vice-Chairperson. Henk of Czechoslovakia was elected as spokesperson.

(Central News Agency, Flushing Meadow, 23rd Dispatch) The United Nations General Assembly has now completed its organizational phase after passing the agenda proposed by the Steering Committee today. From tomorrow onwards, the General Assembly will move to Success Lake and begin its actual work, dividing the 61 items on the agenda among the six committees and two ad hoc committees for substantive discussion. After a full day of careful discussion, today's meeting resolved to pass all the items on the provisional agenda. Among the items passed, except for the Greek and Italian peace treaty issues, all were passed smoothly without any debate. In addition, the General Assembly passed the proposal to establish a special committee to handle the Palestine issue with 29 votes to 11, with 6 abstentions. Before voting on the agenda items, the General Assembly first listened to a speech by UN Secretary-General Trygve Lie (see yesterday's dispatch). The special appeal of Lie was still ringing in their ears when Soviet Representative Vyshinsky and US Representative Austin engaged in a verbal battle over the legitimacy of including the Greek and Italian peace treaty issues on the General Assembly's agenda. Vyshinsky argued that resolving the issue of Korean independence was the responsibility of the major powers, not something the United Nations should discuss. When Vyshinsky blamed the United States for the deadlock in the Korean issue, US Representative Austin immediately stood up to refute him. Chinese Representative Jiang Tingfu, in supporting the US position, reiterated China's position on Korean independence (this position had been stated by our Representative Gu Weijun at the General Assembly). When voting on whether the Italian peace treaty issue should be included on the General Assembly's agenda, China abstained. Among the countries that voted against were Abyssinia and the Soviet bloc countries. Although the United States won an initial experimental vote on the above issue, it is still unclear whether this is a true victory for the United States in this diplomatic battle against the Soviet Union, as the discussions in the United Nations General Assembly have so far only been on procedural issues.

### Truman Calls Cabinet Meeting - Statement on Food Situation May Be Issued Today - Clayton and Others Summoned Home to Report

(Report from This Newspaper) San Francisco, 24th Broadcast: President Truman convened a special cabinet meeting today to discuss what officials called "the general food situation." It is expected that the cabinet meeting will discuss the issue of Western Europe's request for assistance and its potential impact on domestic prices in the United States. According to the White House press secretary, President Truman's statement will not be issued tonight and may be issued tomorrow, as the President has scheduled a press conference for tomorrow.

(Reuters, Washington, 23rd Dispatch) President Truman met with Agriculture Secretary Anderson again today to prepare the statement he will issue regarding the responsibility of the United States for the world food problem. Authoritative sources said that the content of the President's statement will include the following points: Pointing out that the shortfall in world grain supplies this year will reach four to five million tons, and the people of the world are threatened by famine. Calling for a halt to speculative waves in the Chicago grain market to prevent stimulating grain prices and prevent European countries lacking dollars from being hit again. Calling on farmers to stop feeding grain to livestock and urging people to voluntarily reduce meat consumption. Announcing a temporary reduction of 100 million bushels in exports to reduce the stimulation of the Chicago market. At the same time, stating that once the market stabilizes, the export quantity will be increased again. Suggesting that after Congress approves the appropriation, the export of surplus food with higher nutritional value and higher prices, such as dried fruits and sugar, should be used to compensate for the reduction in the export of grains. Related parties expect that the President will not demand that the government have the power to forcibly requisition grain, but many foreign officials believe that this is the only solution to cope with the world food shortage.

(United Press, Washington, 24th Dispatch) Secretary of State Marshall, in order to intensify efforts to cope with the European crisis, telegraphed Undersecretary of State Clayton and Ambassador to the United Kingdom Douglas today to report on the details of the Paris Economic Conference.

The State Department's work of reviewing the plan will take at least a week before it can decide whether the United States agrees with its conclusions.

Those who denounce Jews will be watched by undercover police, and the state will prosecute them. Their crimes are each "incitement to violence."

### UN General Assembly Korean Observer - Criticizes Vyshinsky

Demands Soviet Union Withdraw Troops from North Korea

(United Press, New York, 23rd Dispatch) UN General Assembly Korean Observer Yin Luyi issued a statement today on the speech by Soviet Representative Vyshinsky, saying, "In international history, there has been no speech by an important foreign minister that is so contradictory since Hitler. Mr. Vyshinsky strongly advocates that foreign troops should withdraw from the territory of non-enemy countries, so why does the Soviet Union not take the lead and withdraw its troops stationed in North Korea? Mr. Marshall is justified in placing the Korean issue on the agenda of the General Assembly. Only the power of world public opinion and the rational decisions of representatives of various countries can make Korea a free and democratic country, contributing to peace in Asia."

### United States Has Abundant Resources - Sufficient to Meet European Needs - Investigative Committee Completes Report

(Associated Press, Washington, 24th Dispatch) It was learned here on the 24th that the special committee established by President Truman in June will provide the President with an investigation report at the end of this week. The report shows that the United States, if it can make "some adjustments," actually has most of the resources needed by Europe under the Marshall Plan. The committee, chaired by Interior Secretary Krug, focused on the flexibility of the US economy to adapt to the severe requirements of the Second World War.

General Observation: The Marshall Plan is another round of experiments, which have not been successful in the past. The President established the committee to investigate US resources and their relationship to European reconstruction needs, and to prepare a balance sheet. The committee has completed the report after three months of intense work. In terms of US resources, the responsibilities required by the Marshall Plan can be successfully completed. However, the report warns that adjustments in the substitution and distribution of certain rare materials are urgently needed to meet European estimates. Authoritative sources said that the report pointed out that wheat, grains, coal, steel, nitrogen, fertilizers, and certain types of industrial equipment will be scarce in the next few years. Officials familiar with the report said that the report stated that without automatic or government-mandated allocations, it may not be possible to reach certain export levels. But it said, "If the necessary adjustments are made, the report has no discouraging aspects." The Krug report handed over the final decision-making power and recommendations on meeting European needs to another presidential committee chaired by Commerce Secretary Harriman.

### British and American Condemnation of Bulgarian Government for Execution of Petkov

(Reuters, Washington, 23rd Dispatch) The US government declared today that world opinion believes that the Bulgarian government's execution of Petkov shows its unwillingness to respect the lowest principles of justice and the basic rights of mankind. The statement issued by the State Department pointed out that the timing and manner of Petkov's trial, as well as other repressive measures by the Bulgarian government, show that the Fatherland Front party government controlled by the Communist Party intends to eliminate all opposition forces and consolidate its totalitarian government.

(Associated Press, London, 23rd Dispatch) Diplomatic circles here said that Britain believes that Petkov's execution is "far from European civilization." British Foreign Secretary Bevin consulted with his advisors on whether to lodge a formal protest with the Bulgarian government. It is reported that Bevin attaches great importance to this matter.

### Implementation of Marshall Plan Awaits - Britain Prepares for Self-Reliance - Plans to Develop Final Plan to Cope with Crisis

(Reuters, London, 24th Dispatch) Authoritative sources said that Britain's plan to overcome the economic crisis requires the production of export goods worth £1.7 billion in the next 15 months, and the government has decided not to reduce austerity measures until this goal is achieved. The British government expects to be able to make up for the £600 million trade deficit by the end of 1948.

The plan has five main points: Reduce imports, Reduce overseas spending, Increase exports, Consolidate resources in key industries, Increase agricultural production in Britain and its colonies. Although the total trade deficit of the UK is £600 million, the trade deficit with the dollar area is £800 million, which is because the UK has previously had a trade surplus with countries outside the dollar area. There are two ways to make up for the trade deficit: Reduce imports by about £200 million, Increase exports by £370 million by mid-next year, and increase exports by £570 million by the end of next year, increasing by 40% and 60% respectively compared to the 1938 level. This is only the goal of overcoming the current economic crisis. To restore prosperity, exports must be increased to 175% of pre-war levels, which will only be achieved by 1949. All of Britain's plans are based on the assumption that it will not receive aid under the Marshall Plan. To maintain the needs of the transition period, Britain will have to use its gold reserves or request funds from the International Monetary Fund to cover the expenses.

(Associated Press, Washington, 23rd Dispatch) According to reliable diplomatic sources, France has made a series of requests to the United States. If rejected, it will set back the Marshall Plan by six months. It is reported that the French Ambassador to the United States, Bonnet, informed the US that: France will stop buying goods in the United States from late October onwards, which is an inevitable consequence of the lack of dollars; currently, France is only buying fats, flour, and coal from the United States. Unless a way can be found to continue shipping the above items to France, French coal production will be reduced by more than 30%, as workers will not have enough food to eat.

### France Concerned About Situation in Germany

(Associated Press, Paris, 23rd Dispatch) The French Foreign Ministry said that the success of the 16-nation report on the Marshall Plan depends on whether West Germany is included in the European economy and what the US tariff policy is. "Unless the US doors must be open to European goods, European economic recovery will be hopeless." A spokesman for the French Foreign Ministry also said that an agreement on the entire economic organization of West Germany must be reached by the great powers before the end of this year, otherwise the Marshall Plan will be seriously hit.

### International Bank Has No Funds to Aid Europe

Plans to Resell Bonds to the United States

(United Press, Washington, 23rd Dispatch) International Bank for Reconstruction and Development Vice President Garner announced today that the four-year plan for the economic recovery of the sixteen Western European countries requires a total of US$22.4 billion. Although it is stipulated that under the Marshall Plan, the US government will provide US$19.3 billion in funding, and the World Bank will lend US$3.1 billion, the bank currently only has about US$500 million available for lending. To remedy the situation, the only option is to resell bonds to US investors. Therefore, in fact, all the costs required for European recovery must come from US investors. However, the bank does not want to issue bonds exclusively for Europe.

### Senators Question the Five Bureaus; Education Becomes the Target of Public Criticism; Four Meetings Held Today to Discuss Proposals

(Our Newspaper) Yesterday morning, the Social Affairs, Public Works, Education, Finance, and Police Committees of the Municipal Senate held subcommittee meetings to review proposals. In the afternoon, the fourth plenary session of the Senate held its third meeting. Senators enthusiastically questioned the administration of public utilities, education, sanitation, public works, and land administration for two and a half hours. Those who could not raise their questions orally submitted them in writing, and then Bureau Chief Zhu Ping of the Land Administration Bureau, Bureau Chief Zhao Zukang of the Public Works Bureau, and Bureau Chief Zhao Zeng of the Public Utilities Bureau answered the questions one after another. The replies from the heads of the Sanitation and Education Bureaus were postponed to this afternoon due to the late hour.

Senators had especially numerous questions for the Education Bureau yesterday. Pang Jingzhou reported a fact, saying that some private schools still charged fees exceeding the standards. The Education Bureau ordered each school to submit a budget to the Education Bureau for review to show financial transparency, but the school authorities actually distributed forms with set items to each parent to solicit their consent and then have them stamped and returned. Some parents expressed dissatisfaction and intended to criticize, but their children begged their parents, saying, "If you don't stamp your consent, I will lose points at school." So the parents stamped their consent vaguely. This situation is not only harmful to parents but also greatly affects the education of children, making them learn to deceive and break the law from a young age, which is truly heartbreaking. Does the Education Bureau pay attention to this?

Zhou Lianze said that the Municipal Normal School on Lao Bazi Road falsely reported the number of students and is suspected of fraud and corruption. Why doesn't the Education Bureau order an investigation? Zhang Zhihan and Xie Dahuang said that the attached middle school of the Municipal Normal School destroyed the building of Wuben Girls' Middle School, causing losses of more than 100 million yuan. A formal educational institution has such savage behavior and should be severely punished. Lu Shidao said: The Yangshupu district donated 600 to 700 million for school celebrations for the birthday, and now four schools have been established, all in the alleys. Two of the schools were reorganized from private schools. This situation violates the original purpose of the birthday celebration. Zhong Yuliang asked why elementary schools cannot expel bad students? And why can't incompetent teachers be transferred? Zhao Yangxiong loudly called for the elimination of illiteracy to reduce various social problems.

Jiang Jizhou said: Many elementary schools are located in alleys, and classes are held in the early morning or evening, which is detrimental to the health of students. Furthermore, they wander around at home or on the streets during the day. How can we be optimistic about such education? Also, is the selection of principals fair and reasonable?

What is the Use of Teachers' Appreciation Money?

Chen asked: What was the use of the 100 million yuan teachers' appreciation fund collected by the municipal schools in the first half of last year? Also, seeing that only half of the refresher course fees have been refunded to middle schools, and elementary schools have not yet been refunded, is it planned to continue the refund? Jiang Hao asked for the establishment of a municipal school in the Old Zhabei district. Hou asked for the establishment of a school in the new district. said that the tuition fees of the former municipal schools were even higher than those of private schools due to too many items. Some students in the Pudong municipal schools were abandoned outside the school because they could not pay the fees. The authorities should find a way to solve this.

Regarding the Sanitation Bureau, Hou said that the corpses of Tongren and Fuyuantang were placed on the roadside, affecting sanitation. Please order an immediate investigation and ban. Zhang Zhongyuan hopes that municipal hospitals will admit patients first and then ask for fees. Fan Shouyuan asked to stop outsiders from using doctors' names to make advertisements and deceive people of money. Also, please ask the Sanitation Bureau to find a way to clean up the garbage, feces, and sewage on the roads.

### A Tense Scene: Uneven Gas Distribution for Cars; Efforts to Strive for Quota Rationing

Questions Regarding Public Utilities: Senators expressed dissatisfaction with the poor management of gasoline distribution for cars. Fei Shusheng especially advocated quota rationing, which caused a tense scene. Fei complained that it is often difficult to get gas for cars, and gas stations do not deliver gas on time. As a result, scalpers take the opportunity to hoard. Once he personally saw a truck record 4,000 or 50 gallons of gasoline added every day, but it is not easy to get gallons for those who go to add gas with a license according to the regulations. If there are cards and licenses, why...

Bureau Chief Zhao explained: There are many difficult problems. The Public Utilities Bureau has issued about 16,000 licenses, but there are only 49 gas stations and few oil tankers. Everyone goes to add gas, which creates a situation that cannot be handled. In fact, there is no shortage of oil. He asked the Senate to advise citizens not to panic. However, there are indeed cases of fraud at gas stations. After investigation, some gas stations have been closed. He will also ask the oil company to replace the owners of the gas stations. The bureau is currently trying to improve the method. It has notified the oil company that large trucks can only add a maximum of 15 gallons per day and cars 5 gallons per day in the future. Fei was dissatisfied with the Director's reply and insisted that the monthly consumption of trucks and cars should be stipulated separately according to their needs to prevent hoarding. Director Zhao immediately stated that the problem of adding gas is complicated and is willing to discuss the opinions with Senator Fei in detail and submit them to the Economic Inspection Committee for reporting. Fei insisted on his suggestion and asked the Bureau Chief to accept it. Later, Deputy Speaker Xu expressed his opinion and asked the Bureau Chief to submit Senator Fei's suggestion to the Economic Inspection Committee for discussion. This case then .

### Public Utilities Price Increase; Why Does the Deposit Also Increase?

Fei also asked: Public utilities prices have increased, why has the deposit also increased? Director Zhao replied: The deposits are now called security deposits. The price increase is stipulated by the central government, but in order to reduce the burden on citizens, the municipal government specially invited the authorities of various companies to hold a meeting to set a flexible method, stipulating that at most two adjustments can be made within one year. If there are more, this bureau can handle it. Fei asked the director to submit a request to the central government on behalf of the citizens of Shanghai to abolish the security deposit system. Director Zhao immediately stated that he hoped that the Senate would make a formal motion so that the Public Utilities Bureau could definitely convey it.

### Why is He Still Employing Japanese Staff?

Chen Boliang also questioned: Why is the Public Utilities Bureau's Transportation Company still employing Japanese technicians? What is the basis for the base salary of 260 yuan? How can Song Yunhui, the legal advisor of the Exchange Company, also serve as a committee member and deputy director of the preparation? What experience does Song have? Can a lawyer work as a public official? What is the basis for his base salary of 430 yuan and subsidies? What is the experience of the accounting director? The original base salary was set at 210 yuan, why should it be given 400 yuan? Why are all the expenses of Director Zhang Ming's housing paid for by the government?

### Because of a Lack of "Talent"

Director Zhao immediately replied one by one: There are currently two Japanese technicians, who have been approved by the Ministry of Communications. The two are now on the electric tram outside Jianjiao because we lack technical talents. The government employs them with a broad mind, just like the Soviet Union employed Germans. The legal advisor is needed, and he is helping with the preparation. His actual title is still advisor, and his subsidies are public funds. The base salary of the accounting director was originally approved by the municipal government at 280 yuan. Because of his high ability, the municipal government was asked to increase it to 400 yuan. The house where Director Zhang lives is a company dormitory, and all the equipment in the dormitory should be provided by the government.

### Today's Agenda

(Our Newspaper) From 9:00 AM today, the Autonomous, Sanitation, Budget and Final Accounts, Regulations, and Land Administration Committees of the Senate will hold subcommittee meetings in the Senate to review proposals.

First, Bureau Chief Zhang of the Sanitation Bureau and Acting Bureau Chief Li of the Education Bureau will answer questions, and then proposals will be discussed.

### Land Registration Certificates to be Completed Within Six Months

On the land administration front, there were fewer questions. Wang Guoxian and others asked why the land registration certificates were not issued. Director Zhu said: 147,000 land registrations have been received, of which 124,000 have been reviewed, 84,000 certificates have been issued, and more than 12,000 are still under review. Among them, some need to complete the procedures, some have unclear sources of property rights, some have lost property certificates, some have not redeemed property rights, some are in violation of the law, and some have disputes, so certificates have not been issued. The processing will be completed this year.

### Why are there so many holes in the road? Why are they not repaired diligently? Why is the Pudong Avenue not repaired? Is the asphalt removed being utilized?

Regarding questions related to the Public Works Bureau, most people asked why there are so many holes in the road? Why not add more repairs? Bureau Chief Zhao Zukang replied that the price of road repair materials has skyrocketed, and funds are limited, so only the main roads can be repaired first. Chen Peide and Zhang Zhihan both asked why the Pudong Avenue has not been repaired so far.

Answer: It is planned to repair the 17-kilometer section from the Shangnan Railway to Donggou first. As for the Yuejiang Bridge, the plan has been drawn up and a tunnel type will be built, but the start date is not yet ripe. Jiang Hao asked if the removed asphalt is being utilized? Answer: All are fully utilized, without any waste. Hou Junren and Zhang Zhihan both said that the Suzhou Creek has become a stinking water ditch, which is a serious problem. Answer: We have contacted the Pudong Bureau and will try to dredge it as much as possible.

### The Silverware Industry Association's General Assembly; Business Resumption Still Pending

(Our Newspaper) Since the authorities stipulated the methods for the silverware industry to resume business, the Silverware Industry Association convened a general meeting of all members in the auditorium of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday to discuss various issues related to the resumption of business, and invited Gu Bingyuan, the director of the Social Affairs Bureau, to attend the meeting to explain seven points that should be observed when purchasing and selling gold ornaments: The price of gold ornaments sold should be based on the gold price listed by the Central Bank, plus 40% for operating expenses and 20% for legal profits, and an additional labor cost may be added, but all prices are not allowed to be listed. The purchase price of gold ornaments may be appropriately subsidized for their labor costs depending on the work, but it must not be arbitrarily increased. Purchases are limited to gold ornaments, and the purchase of gold bars or gold ornaments is absolutely prohibited. Sales are also limited to gold ornaments, and it is absolutely forbidden to sell gold ornaments in melted bars. Each piece of gold ornament sold must not exceed two market taels. Purchases and sales of gold ornaments should be recorded separately on the books and invoices, and the expenses should be clearly stated one by one for verification. If the market fluctuates and the price must be revised, the association should write to the Social Affairs Bureau for approval. All directors and supervisors of the silverware industry should set an example, supervise their members, and supervise each other. If there is any violation of the above matters, they should be responsible for reporting it. Then, they jointly discussed methods to prohibit black market trading. As for the issue of resuming business, because the actual difficulties in operation still need to be discussed with the authorities, and the order from the authorities allowing the resumption of business has not yet arrived, the resumption period may still be pending.

Payment Methods

Still Pending Approval

Yesterday, the Municipal Government received an order from the Ministry of Finance stating that the methods for paying the gold price for silverware shops in Shanghai must be submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval before implementation is allowed. The Municipal Government has prepared a document and submitted it to the Executive Yuan for approval and filing. The Social Affairs Bureau has also notified the Silverware Industry Association.

### The China Trust Bureau's Handling of the Large Yarn Factory Property on Yulin Road; Detailed Account

(Our Newspaper) Since the Committee of Resident Members of the Senate raised the issue of investigating the China Trust Bureau's sale of enemy property at a low price, this reporter recently learned the details of the matter from relevant parties as follows:

Regarding the property on Yulin Road, the land was originally purchased by the owner, Chen Rentao, from the Dede Hall, and it was agreed that the lease term would be until the end of the 42nd year of the Republic of China. Upon expiration, the house would belong to the landowner. On January 22nd of the 30th year of the Republic of China, a large silver company transferred the surface rights to the Gonghuo Yarn Factory, but the factory was unable to recover the house for use as a workshop and still lived in the original tenants. After the victory, the original situation was maintained. In fact, it was completely occupied by the Shanghai Fish Market and other civilians, and there were no vacant houses. After the Textile Management Committee took over, it sent an official letter to the China Trust Bureau, stating that it was impossible for the households to move out immediately, but it was also inconvenient to rent the houses by household if the established fact was recognized. At that time, the landowner, Chen Rentao, used funds to repurchase the remaining seven years of surface rights stipulated in the contract. After review by the former Enemy Property Processing Bureau, since the term of the above-mentioned surface rights was only more than seven years, the current houses could not be used by Zhongfang, and the small amount of rent could not be In addition, the entire house structure was not suitable for use as a factory, and it was one mile away from the Gongda Yarn Factory, so there was no need to merge and handle it with Gongda. Therefore, the landowner was allowed to pay the price at once to repurchase the surface rights, but since all the houses were occupied, what the original owner repurchased was only the right to income and not the right to use. The price to be paid was the rent for the remaining seven years, deducting the expenses to be borne by the owner. The calculation of the rent was based on a field survey. The monthly rent for each house in July of the 34th year of the Republic of China was 3,000 yuan in puppet currency. Generally speaking, the rent this year is about four times that of the 34th year of the Republic of China. Therefore, the monthly rent for each house in Yulinli should be 12,000 yuan, which is 144,000 yuan per year. The total rent for 128 houses is 18,432,000 yuan. After deducting 25% for management expenses, the owner's net profit is 13,824,000 yuan per year. If the seven-year rent is paid at once, calculated at an annual interest rate of 7%, it should be 74,456,064 yuan. At an annual interest rate of 7%, which is 20 times lower than the black market, the interest deducted by the cleaning office is obviously suppressed. Moreover, according to the gold price in the 34th year of the Republic of China, each ten taels was converted into 6.2 million yuan in puppet currency at that time. The highest black market gold price after the victory was far above this number, which is enough to prove that the above-mentioned rent was calculated at four times the number of puppet currency in July of the 34th year of the Republic of China, which was obviously not underestimated. Changshi ordered the landowner to settle the case by paying the price at once, which was beneficial to the national treasury. In addition, the decision on this number was still during the tenure of Director Liu Gongyun, and was made by the current Director Wu Rencang

Regarding the handling of general enemy and puppet properties, enemy and puppet real estate were originally received by the original receiving agencies, such as the Headquarters of the Third Front Army, the Military Statistics Bureau, the Shanghai Municipal Government, the German Overseas Chinese Management Committee, and other receiving agencies that first came to Shanghai, and then transferred them to the China Trust Bureau. There were people living in the houses when they were transferred, and it is still difficult to vacate them, making sales and meeting the needs of government agencies difficult. Residents pay usage fees on a monthly basis, and there are also cases where agencies and troops refuse to pay. The bureau has reported these situations for approval. All information on residents and processing registers was submitted to the supervisory committee that came to Shanghai in early May.

Regarding the secret collection of transfer fees, the bureau suggested in another document submitted to the supervisory committee that the Executive Yuan should consider first vacating the occupants to facilitate bidding. If this can be done, the truth can be revealed through the complaints of those who paid to transfer the property.

Regarding the accelerated handling of property inheritance claims, the China Trust Bureau stated that there are many disputes over illegal properties, which are ruled by the court. After the case is settled, it can be handled quickly or returned to the owner.

### Gold and Paper Money Black Market Still Rampant; Two More Agencies Raided Yesterday; Evidence Seized from Guotai Silver Firm and Dechang Money Shop; Economic Section Chief Says Comprehensive Crackdown Will Occur Shortly

(Our Newspaper) The Economic Section of the Police Bureau recently learned that Guotai Silver Firm at 479 Sichuan Middle Road in this city, although seemingly closed on the surface, is actually the nerve center of the city's gold and paper money black market. It moves hundreds of taels of gold and thousands of US dollars in and out every day. In order to avoid attracting attention, it uses 329 Yongyuanli, Tianjin Road, Jiangxi Road as the transaction agency for gold and paper money transactions after they are completed. Thus, without making a sound, Section Chief Xu dispatched team leader Chen Cheng, along with officers Si Yunkui, Liang Heting, Yang Guocheng and others to Jiangxi Road for investigation at 10 o'clock yesterday morning. As a result, six large gold bars and more than fifty small bars were seized, totaling 112 taels, eight maces and nine fen, as well as 22 and a half gold pounds, and many evidences such as account books and checkbooks were seized, and Si Rongxin, the stock accountant of Bian Tai Bank, and Sun Yuxin, an employee, and three others were arrested at the scene. However, Manager Wang Kewen and Shen Boping had already heard the news and fled beforehand.

She was of a lonely background and resided at the home of a friend surnamed Liu at No. 109, Dongzhao Lane, Sigaota Road. Seven years ago, Zhang was in love with a young engineer named Liang Mingke, and they were very close. Later, they separated due to the outbreak of war. After the victory, Liang and Zhang reunited in Shanghai, but Liang already had a wife and children. Although they still associated from time to time, Zhang pursued Liang intensely. At this time, Liang had already expressed his coldness. On Sunday, the 21st of this month, Zhang waited all day for Liang to go out, but he never arrived. Zhang, being unemployed and impoverished, and also suffering from Liang's indifference, became weary of life. On the night before last, around 9 pm, wearing a red floral print short shirt and pants, she secretly entered Zhongzheng Park and committed suicide by throwing herself into the lake. She was discovered and rescued by gardener Tang Jinming, who reported to the North Sichuan Road Police Station, which sent her to the Municipal Fourth Hospital for emergency treatment.

### Electrical Workers Obey Orders and Resume Work

Director Wu Hopes that Well-Behaved Workers Will Recognize the Communist Bandit Conspiracy and Not Be Deceived

(Central News Agency) After receiving a limited order from the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday afternoon, all employees of the Shanghai Electric Power Company immediately resumed work. At 3 pm, all factory and company employees at Yangpu, Buren Road, and other locations had resumed work.

Yesterday morning, all employees of the company still went to the factory. Except for the power generation department, which continued to work as usual, the remaining employees did not work, resulting in a state of intentional slow-down. The Social Affairs Bureau specifically ordered the Electric Power Company Industrial Union to immediately resume work, otherwise, the company authorities would be allowed to unconditionally dismiss non-working workers and dissolve the industrial union. After the order was delivered, all employees fully resumed work. According to Shen Ding, Director of the Labor Affairs Department of the Social Affairs Bureau, the six people arrested from the Electric Power Company, including Wu Kewen, were arrested by the government for having solid evidence of reactionary activities. They cannot be compared to other situations, and they cannot arbitrarily strike or petition. Moreover, the decision to slow down work today (i.e., yesterday) was made by the board of directors during a petition to the Social Affairs Bureau on the evening of the 23rd. Therefore, it is clear that a small number of people are manipulating and inciting. During this period of general mobilization, incitement to slow down work or strike will not be tolerated.

(Central News Agency) Wu Kaixian, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, made a statement yesterday regarding the arrest by the police of communist bandits, including Zhang Zhongzhi and Wu Kewen, within the Electric Power Company Union at the Futong Printing House. He said: Last January, when I took office, the workers of the Electric Power Company were in the midst of a complete work slowdown. On February 12, the bureau convened labor and management to sign a settlement record, which included a clause stating that "the union promises to provide a written guarantee to the Social Affairs Bureau and the company that if there are any labor-management disputes in the future, there will be no work slowdowns or strikes during the mediation or arbitration period, in accordance with the law." However, labor unrest has occurred repeatedly over the past year, and work slowdowns have occurred at every turn, making it clear that they have not complied with the agreement. I have always respected labor and have repeatedly shown tolerance and made every effort to mediate when the workers of the company have broken their promises. It was only after this incident was discovered by the police that I realized that the labor unrest in the factory was actually a planned act of sabotage by a small number of communist bandits who were holding the union hostage. It is clear that the communist bandits in Shanghai want to bankrupt industry, cause workers to lose their jobs, create social unrest, and plunge the city into chaos, and the consequences will be dire. The government will not condone such communist bandits who endanger the survival of society and the lives of the people, and will take strict measures. I believe that the majority of laborers and workers of the Electric Power Company are law-abiding and well-behaved workers who have been manipulated and incited by a small number of conspirators, causing them to fall into their trap. Now that the facts are clear, I sincerely hope that all workers will recognize the sinister schemes of the communist bandits and not be deceived or blindly follow them, leading to their own loss and suffering.

### Zhang Qun Talks About the Three Treasures in the Northeast

(Shenyang Dispatch from this Newspaper, 21st) Zhang Qun has flown here. He has shown a special affection for the Northeast. During his student days, he saw a thesis by Dr. Bianchuan at the home of Mr. Baihui, a member of the Japanese Socialist Party, entitled "Japan's Rights in Manchuria," and immediately felt concerned about the safety of the Northeast. He said to the citizens of Shenyang: "We have three treasures in the Northeast: ginseng, sable fur, and Ula grass. Where are these three treasures now?"

"A nation also has three treasures: land, people, and sovereignty. Now, the land and people have not been fully recovered, and sovereignty is not complete. What treasures are still in our embrace?" He raised a very profound question: The central government has decided to resolutely implement the national policy of industrializing the Northeast. Within three days, he is willing to see more, listen more, speak more, and thoroughly understand the real environment of the Northeast with the people of the Northeast. Mr. Zhang claimed to be a bridge between the central and local governments. He represents the Central Committee's complete trust in Director Chen Cheng and is completely connected to the concerns and affection of the people of the Northeast.

Mr. Zhang spoke to reporters with a sincere and frank attitude, without reservation, like an old friend of the reporters. He could not hide his enthusiasm for the Northeast. He said: "I first came to the Northeast in 1907 to pass through Japan to redeem books. I came to the Northeast for the second time in 1929 to ask Zhang Xueliang to cooperate with the central government. This is now the third time I have come to the Northeast. I originally wanted to arrive on September 18, but I was delayed by attending a central meeting." The "September 18th Incident" made him

Interested in historical memories

And also felt heavy hearted! He said: "The September 18th Incident changed the history of China and triggered World War II. History proves that the safety of the Northeast is not only related to the survival of the country but also related to world security. The national policy of recovering the Northeast, building the Northeast, and guaranteeing national independence and freedom will never change." He put forward two famous quotes from ancient Chinese political philosophy: "The people are the foundation of the nation, and when the foundation is strong, the nation is stable," and urged the people of the Northeast to encourage the people of the Northeast with the four words "Advocate Law and Seek Truth," to be new people, to practice new life, to create a new atmosphere, and to shoulder new missions.

At a time when the situation in the Northeast is transitioning from an old stage to a new stage, Zhang Qun's arrival in the Northeast can be said to be a major event. He has brought the people of the Northeast

Enough hope and comfort.

He is probably the first Premier of the Republic of China to come to the Northeast. Chen Cheng, concurrently in charge of the Northeast military and political affairs, only saw the swift and decisive rectification movement, and the issue of canceling the special status of the Northeast is still being planned behind the scenes. How to proceed, the central government maintains caution. This time, Zhang Qun first expressed his opinion on the Northeast currency system: The central government has not considered the issue of reforming the Northeast currency system because it was originally issued to stabilize the Northeast economy. Today, if we want to consider changing it, we must first consider this issue. Zhang's opinion on this issue is the best test for canceling the special status of the Northeast. (Reporter Zhao Zhan)

### Haining Merchants and Residents Build Tidal Viewing Sheds

(Haining Dispatch from this Newspaper, 22nd) The "Haining Tide" has a long history. Once the autumn flood arrives, the "Orphan Soul Tide" and the "Sea King Tide" will arrive together. According to legend, the eighteenth day of the eighth lunar month is the "Tide's Birthday." When the tide comes, it is like a stack, like a chain, with a rumbling sound that never stops. The momentum is like ten thousand horses galloping, shaking the earth and overturning the sky, collapsing mountains and overturning the sea, rushing mightily, jumping beads and surging froth, it is an amazing spectacle. The tide season this year has passed, but because the collapse of the Nansha River (located across the river from the Haining Dike) has intensified, the sea sand has poured into the outside of the Haining Dike. Over time, the beach has extended far overseas by ten miles. During the Orphan Soul Tide (the middle of the seventh lunar month), there is no tide to watch at the Haining Dike. The water only rises a few feet outside the beach. Recently, salt farmers have begun to build thatched huts on the beach. The place where the angry waves used to crash is now becoming a large-scale performance venue.

In the area of ​​Babu (near Chenwengang), the tide is still fierce. After the autumn flood began, the seawall was eroded by the waves and collapsed again, a few hundred steps away from Qibu City and the Shanghai-Hangzhou National Highway. Farmers who planted sandy land have dismantled their houses and moved their belongings one after another. The Seawall Engineering Bureau has now tendered for the construction of cement-mixed steel concrete seawalls in the area, and temporary merchants have started building tidal-viewing sheds. Although the tide does not have its former grandeur when it comes, it is expected that the grand occasion will not be weaker than the Haining Dike at that time.

### Nansha Autumn Tide Can Be Passed Safely

After the six people returned to the company, more than twenty military police came and confiscated one Carl Ping gun, one Type 38 machine gun, and eleven rifles from the team. Town Mayor Xi Yutang, Instructor Liu Peng, and Wu Sanbao and other seven people were arrested. At noon, after receiving the report, County Magistrate Xu immediately spoke on the phone with Xu, the Commander of Xici Bridge, asking about the cause and effect, and put forward three points: If Wu Sanbao has indeed committed a crime, the military police can take him away for investigation, and the county government should be informed by letter of Wu Sanbao's crime and the interrogation situation. All the confiscated guns from the self-defense team should be returned. If they must be taken away, a receipt should be given. If the town mayor and instructor of Beizhu are suspected of a crime, please notify the county government with official documents to take them into custody, and temporarily release them. Xu, the Commander, released the town mayor in the evening, and the confiscated guns have not yet been returned, but a receipt was given. At midnight, Mayor Xi rushed to the county government to report the incident to County Magistrate Xu, and the defense of Beizhu was temporarily taken over by the Qingyang Police Bureau.

### High Rice Prices and Low Salt Prices: Salt Farmers Reluctant to Hand Over Salt: Salt Administration Adopts New Measures

(Hangzhou Dispatch from this Newspaper, 23rd) The issue of salt prices in the Yuyao Salt Field was previously decided by the Ministry of Social Affairs to be based on the principle of one dan of rice per thousand stones of salt, according to the current negotiated price. However, since August, the Salt Field Administration has gone back on its word and restored the assessed price system, which is below the standard, resulting in salt farmers being reluctant to hand over salt. Recently, the price of rice has been rising daily, and the price of salt has been low at 28,000 yuan, and payments are in arrears, resulting in even less salt being handed over. The Salt Administration has therefore taken emergency new measures to force the handover of salt, and the salt farmers who were arrested have not yet been released.

(Yuyao Dispatch from this Newspaper, 22nd) The issue of salt prices in the Yuyao Anjiao Salt Field has not been resolved reasonably.

The situation is still at a stalemate.

### National Textile Industry Production Conference Opens Today; Vice Minister Liu Briefs Reporters on the Conference's Mission Yesterday

(Reported by our newspaper) The National Textile Industry Production Conference is scheduled to open at 9:00 AM this morning at the City Chamber of Commerce. The conference will last for three days and will be chaired by Chen Qitian. As of yesterday, more than sixty proposals had been received, mainly focusing on production and reconstruction. The Ministry of Economic Affairs also has a proposal for a five-year plan to develop the textile industry. The conference schedule is as follows: The opening ceremony will be held in the morning, with addresses. In the afternoon, the conference will feature reports from relevant agencies such as the Central Bank, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Textile Adjustment Committee, and the Export Control Committee, as well as representatives from the Textile Construction Company and private factories. Group review meetings will be held on the second day in both the morning and afternoon. The conference will continue on the third day with a general meeting to pass proposals before closing.

(Another report) The Preparatory Committee for the Textile Production Conference hosted a press conference at 3:00 PM yesterday, chaired by Liu Siying, the committee's chairman. He stated that the development of national industry must start with the textile industry, and the Ministry of Economic Affairs attaches great importance to this, which is why this production conference is being held. It will bring together leaders from industry, commerce, and finance to synthesize opinions from all sides and create a plan for implementation. China's textile industry has a history of sixty years and has achieved remarkable results. If it can be expanded and developed, it can not only solve the clothing problem but also raise living standards and create full employment. According to the industrial plan and the chairman's instructions, China should have 12 million spindles and 300,000 looms. However, China currently has only 4 million spindles (3.5 million in operation) and 68,000 looms. It cannot be self-sufficient, let alone export. It is hoped that this conference will gather opinions from all parties on improving production technology, cultivating talent, reducing costs, improving product quality, and coordinating labor and management, so that state-owned and private factories can closely cooperate and work together. He then discussed the work of the Textile Adjustment Committee, stating that its goals are twofold: one is to concentrate yarn and cloth resources to stabilize prices, and the other is to strive for fair allocation of cotton yarn, with distribution prices referring to cost and market conditions, and to strive for reasonable and flexible pricing.

Yesterday, a buying spree was strongly revived for Chinese stocks. Initially, there was some panic, and there was a prolonged sluggishness. After 11:20 AM, stimulated by the Hong Kong exchange rate and the reduction of margin requirements, buying pressure arose, and short sellers wavered. Stock No. 224 turned bullish, and at the same time, made advances towards Xinyi. Therefore, the price increases were immediately astounding, and blue-chip stocks sharply increased.

Morning Session

Opening in the morning, all stocks rose due to the influence of the high off-exchange prices of the previous evening. Everyone was somewhat wary. Cantonese merchants were particularly eager to sell, and many unloaded their holdings. Deyong Yarn and spot Deyong Yarn immediately declined after opening. After 10:30 AM, off-exchange interest rates opened high at 2 jiao 1 fen and 2 jiao 5.5 fen, and rumors of traditional cloth production caused the price to fall to 239 yuan for immediate delivery and 240 yuan for deferred delivery. Spot Deyong Yarn and deferred Deyong Yarn were bought at lower prices, rising back to 242 yuan and 244 yuan, respectively. After 11:15 AM, bulls were unable to support the price, and it was forced down again to a low of 238 yuan for immediate delivery and 240 yuan for deferred delivery.

Unexpectedly, within ten minutes, the spread with Hong Kong greatly narrowed, and there was also talk that margin requirements would be reduced to 30% collateral and 20% cash. Buying was strong, and in addition to short covering, there was also much buying from speculators. All stocks sharply rose. Near the close, spot Deyong Yarn rose to a high of 268 yuan, and deferred Deyong Yarn to 270 yuan. After the close, the asking price was confused. As a result, compared to the previous close for spot stocks, Xinyi rose by 10%, Yong Yarn, Meiya, Xinguang, China France, Rongfeng, and Wuhe rose by 5%, Jingfu, Neiyi, Huafeng, China Silk, and Commercial Press slightly increased, Xinhua and Huaxin fell by 5%, and Qinxing Cement, Match, and Zhabei Conscription decreased. For deferred stocks, Jingfu slightly increased, and Yong Yarn, Meiya, Huazhou, and Qinxing rose by 5%, while Xinyi rose by 10%.

Afternoon Session

Evening newspapers reported that margin requirements would be reduced to 30%, which improved market sentiment. Spot stocks opened high, with Yong Yarn rising to 275 yuan. Due to heavy buying, the price of Xinyi rose to the limit. However, Cantonese merchants and those who had profited frequently sold, lowering the price to 269 yuan. Later, it rose again to 274 yuan, and those who profited sold off their holdings. Although there was support from the state-owned banks and Stock No. 224, Yong Yarn was forced down to close at 265 yuan. The remaining stocks also retreated.

As a result, compared to the morning close for spot stocks, Yong Yarn, Hengfeng, and Zhabei Cement slightly decreased, Xinyi rallied after a sharp rise and closed higher, with Meiya, Lianyi, and Commercial Press experiencing small gains, Huafeng, Zhongfang, Match, and Huaxin rising by 5%, Qinxing, Xinhua, and Jinglun rising by about 15%, China France remaining flat, and Rongzheng falling by 5%. For deferred stocks, there was only trading in the first half of the day, and trading was suspended in the afternoon. The situation for various old stocks off-exchange was stable.

### Government Bonds Sluggish; Foreign Stocks Slightly Recover

Government bonds were even weaker yesterday, with a turnover of only 2 million. The process was extremely sluggish. Unified Class C agricultural bonds opened at 2,200 yuan, fell to a low of 11,900 yuan, and closed around 12,700 yuan. As a result, compared to the previous close, Classes A and B remained flat, Unified Class C rose by 600 yuan, Class D rose by 100 yuan, and Unified Class E fell by 210 yuan.

Foreign stocks were slightly higher after being popular yesterday. After the securities firms intervened, the market rapidly advanced. Banks, trading firms, and Xiangchang merchants all bought. It was rumored that the Hong Kong Telegraph spread was greatly reduced, but Reuters still reported 10.02 yuan. Yisha Nong opened at 102,000 yuan and rose from 101,500 yuan to 112,000 yuan. In the afternoon, it fell back to close at 107,000 yuan. As a result, compared to the previous close, Yisha rose slightly less than 5%, Xiangtai remained flat, Steel Industry and Telephone slightly decreased, and the remaining stocks slightly increased.

### Rice Prices Surge and Retreat Quickly

Yesterday, a total of over 13,500 shi of rice arrived in the North and South markets. In the early market, japonica and indica rice prices uniformly rose by over 20,000 yuan. However, as supplies poured in, merchants became less enthusiastic, and the market situation quickly reversed, resulting in a rapid surge and retreat. Superior-quality rice rose by 10,000 yuan, while medium- and lower-quality rice remained flat. There were few new arrivals of Baiyuan rice.

Flour allocation prices remained the same, and market sales were sluggish. Foreign flour sharply increased by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan, while unified and factory flour rose by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Bran was slightly active due to out-of-town merchants, and rural sales also inquired, with demand exceeding supply. The market rose rapidly, continuing its frenzy by 6,000 to 7,000 yuan. Bean cakes continued to be absorbed by Shantou, rising by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Soybean oil factories selectively picked up supplies. Local retail sales were active, initially rising but then remaining flat with no major price changes.

Philippine beans were absorbed by the market, and sales were brisk, gradually rising by 10,000 yuan. Soybean oil continued to be purchased, and the market was firm. Broad beans had even arrivals and sales, and the situation was stable. Red sorghum sellers were very firm, slightly increasing by 1,000 yuan. Qingdao corn remained sluggish, falling by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Sesame arrivals were plentiful, and sales were sluggish. The quality was poor, the market was tired, and prices fell steadily, declining by 10,000 yuan. Raw peanuts were readily absorbed by Cantonese merchants, rising by another 10,000 yuan. Wheat was expected to rise.

Oil merchants were still enthusiastic, and the market was lively. Crude oil continued to rise by 20,000 to 30,000 yuan, and soybean oil also rose by another 20,000 to 30,000 yuan. Clear oil and rapeseed oil also increased by 20,000 to 30,000 yuan. However, sesame oil arrivals continued, falling by 20,000 to 30,000 yuan. The market situation was mixed with both rises and falls.

### Yarn Prices Raised Again; 20-Count Yarn Listed at 14.5 Million Yuan

(Reported by our newspaper) The Textile Adjustment Committee raised cotton yarn and weaving prices again yesterday. 20-count yarn was listed at 14.5 million yuan, an increase of 140 yuan compared to the previous price.

Yarn Prices Rise

The yarn market initially opened steady yesterday. Subsequently, due to the Textile Adjustment Committee's increased allocation prices, market sentiment immediately turned firm and active, and prices rose from flat to higher. Finally, 42-count blue-label yarn rose to 25.9 million yuan, an increase of 1.4 million compared to the previous day. Other fine yarns also increased.

Cotton Cloth Rises

The cotton cloth market opened weak and soft, and speculators were quick to sell. Merchants stopped buying and started selling, and prices declined. Towards the close, there was buying at lower prices, and it was heard that the Hong Kong exchange rate had sharply narrowed. Buying sentiment in the market turned strong, and prices immediately rose. As a result, the leading fine cloth rose by 20,000 yuan compared to the previous day, reaching 623,000 yuan. Prices for various grades of fine cloth rose by about 10,000 yuan. Bleached coarse cloth, drill cloth, and straight-grain cloth were also firm.

Spot Cotton Rises

Yesterday's spot cotton market was stable in the morning. In the afternoon, cotton yarn prices rose sharply, and market sentiment was excited, causing prices to rise again. Yarn factories had low buying interest due to high cotton prices, and transactions were few. Competition among dealers was fierce, and the market rose again. Trading was active. Total daily trading volume was 2,280 bales.

### Tea Market Remains Active

Yesterday, both local and out-of-town merchants continued to purchase tea. Holders were firm in their intention to sell, maintaining market activity. The foreign tea market saw several fluctuations. Negotiations between traders on this year's Keemun black tea continued without agreement from either side, making transactions difficult to initiate. Green tea varieties still saw interest, but lacked large-scale transactions. The trend, due to limited inventory, was for sellers to ask for high prices, maintaining stability. According to industry insiders, local exporters are planning to promote the export of last year's and this year's green tea to North Africa. Success in this endeavor would provide significant support.

### Raw Sugar Rises

Yesterday's sugar market was firm with occasional increases. Raw sugar prices also followed closely. Association listings for spot 20s and medium white sugar were stable between 700,600 yuan and 710,000 yuan with no significant changes. Unofficial afternoon trading reportedly saw continued advances.

### Rayon Prices Skyrocket; Up Over 4 Million Yuan Compared to the Previous Day

The rayon market was very stable in the morning, but in the afternoon, the stock market's strong rise excited market sentiment, causing prices to jump wildly. As a result, prices rose by over 4 million yuan compared to the previous day. 120-count Golden Sanma Youguang rayon opened around 5 million yuan in the morning, traded at 4.5 million yuan at noon, and rose steadily in the afternoon, with the final price jumping to 9 million yuan. The price increases seemed endless, causing manufacturers to be extremely alarmed.

Processed Silk

The processed silk market was quite weak in the morning, with few transactions at any grade. In the afternoon, the sharp rise in rayon revived market sentiment. Asking prices in the afternoon were similar to the previous day, with another 5-6 loads traded at prices 500,000 yuan higher than the previous day. Dried silk had few transactions, and prices did not change.

Silk Fabrics

The silk fabric market was firm in the morning. Zhen Silk bed covers from Dacheng and Qianghuo sold for up to 8.2 million yuan, closing at 7.6 million yuan for the spot price. In the afternoon, influenced by the high raw material prices, off-exchange trading saw prices of 8 million yuan. Meiya bed covers and Dacheng checkered crepe lacked transactions. Ye Jin crepe traded at 42,000 yuan, but the high price deterred merchants, resulting in very few transactions. Minsheng Jingfang woolen mill raised its prices by another 15,000 yuan to 125,000 yuan per yard. Prices in Sheng Hang for various goods also increased, according to reports from the production areas.

Chen Bingzhang, director of the Ministry of Finance's Public Debt Department, has arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing and will preside over the lottery on behalf of Minister Yu.

Director Chen told reporters that the entire fund for the 36th Year US Dollar Bonds and short-term treasury bills has been fully allocated by the Ministry of Finance. According to the regulations for the issuance of gold bonds, the redemption period for US Dollar Bonds is set at ten years. Starting from the date of issuance, a lottery will be held every six months to redeem one-twentieth of the bonds each time. The winning bonds will be redeemed exclusively by the Bank of China for US dollar drafts, which can be freely used by the holders.

The redemption will be jointly handled by the Central Bank and its branches with foreign exchange operations (a total of 19 locations). Payment will be made in legal tender based on the foreign exchange market price at the designated banks at the time of redemption. The first redemption date has been set for September 30th of this year.

Rice merchants recently held a meeting of directors and supervisors and concluded that the authorities' conditions were too harsh and would affect the business of rice merchants. They have requested Director Wu to amend the implementation regulations. Rice merchants reportedly also have little interest in the proposal for a rice joint venture company co-managed by officials and merchants.

### Announcement of New Gold Prices by Ministry of Finance Deemed Untrue

Our Nanjing Dispatch, 24th: The Executive Yuan's News Bureau issued a statement on the 24th saying that the evening newspapers reported that the Ministry of Finance had ordered the announcement of gold prices in Nanjing and Shanghai this afternoon, or tomorrow morning if it was impossible to announce it today. According to a person in charge at the Ministry of Finance, this information is completely untrue and there is no such matter.

(Reported by our newspaper) A report stated that the Ministry of Finance would announce new gold prices on the afternoon of the 24th or this morning (the 25th), and it was also rumored that the government would amend regulations on import and export controls. According to a person in charge at the National Bank, there is no basis for the claim that the Ministry of Finance will announce new gold prices. As for amending regulations on import and export controls, that is also unfounded. However, the Executive Yuan is currently reviewing the regulations for processing imported goods registered in Shanghai, and the aforementioned rumor of amending regulations on import and export controls is likely a misunderstanding of this fact.

### New York China Institute Dinner; Marshall Attends and Speaks, Hoping to Raise Funds in the US to Support Chinese Culture and Education

(United Press, New York, 23rd) Secretary of State Marshall has returned here after meeting with President Truman in Washington and deciding on strategies for various major issues.

This kind of cultural and educational work is extremely important for Sino-American relations and should be promoted.

[Our Newspaper's Report] Ding Wenyuan, the newly appointed president of National Tongji University, has visited the school several times since his appointment was approved by the Executive Yuan. He officially took office at the school yesterday morning. All departments and affiliated hospitals of the school posted slogans, expressing "Welcome Mr. Ding to preside over the school affairs and build a new Tongji." After arriving at the school yesterday, Ding immediately discussed the future promotion of school affairs with the heads of various departments. The Student Union summarized the hopes of all students for President Ding and provided written suggestions. Representatives were sent to visit Ding to present the details, and they were answered separately. The representatives were all satisfied. Ding received reporters from this newspaper and gave his first speech after taking office: Tongji University has a history of 40 years, and its equipment is relatively complete. Many alumni serve in "military engineering" and "military medicine," and have achieved considerable results. The school has moved several times during the war and suffered great losses during the restoration period. In the future, we will try our best to replenish it. The life of professors is difficult and cannot maintain the minimum living standard of a family, and we will also try our best to improve it and strengthen its lineup. Secondly, I hope that students should especially abide by school discipline in order to seek the stability of the school. Under this principle, the spirit of academic freedom should be fully developed, and there should be mutual trust between the school and students. Students can frankly state any reasonable suggestions or requests to the school, and the school will be happy to adopt them. Ding finally said: The school's existing property and permanent address have not yet been determined. At present, the departments and units are scattered in many places, which is very inconvenient. He has asked the Ministry of Education to decide as soon as possible so that it can start leaving the school as soon as possible to build Tongji into a major international university. It is reported that Ding is the younger brother of the late geologist Ding Wenjiang. He graduated from Tongji Medical College and the University of Frankfurt in Germany. He has served as a lecturer at the University of Frankfurt in Germany and the deputy director of the affiliated Chinese College, a senator of the Executive Yuan, a counselor of the Examination Yuan, a counselor of the Chinese Embassy in Germany, the former president of Tongji University, a professor at Central University, and a specialist commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
