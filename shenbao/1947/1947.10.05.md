According to Deputy Secretary-General Zheng Yanfen, Chairman Chiang will stay in Beiping for a short period. The Beiping authorities only received a telegram about the Chairman's arrival in Beiping at 9 AM on the 4th, so the arrangement of the residence in Houyuanensi was extremely rushed, and even laying the cables was still in progress in the evening.

[Our Beiping Office, 4th] While in Beiping, Chairman Chiang may convene a meeting with university presidents, and the list is being drawn up by relevant parties.

[Our Beiping Office, 4th] It is reported that after Fu Zuoyi flew to Yulin yesterday for inspection, he flew to Beiping from Yulin at 4 PM on the 4th. Deng Baoshan, Deputy Director of the Zhangjiakou Pacification Headquarters and Commander-in-Chief of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, came with him to report on the defense situation in Yulin.

### National Army in Jiaodong Crosses the Sea, Lands on Nan Changshan Island, Fierce Fighting Along the Line from Muping to Haiyang

[Central News Agency, Qingdao, 4th] On the 3rd, under the cover of naval artillery fire, the National Army crossed the sea and landed on Nan Changshan Island (north of Penglai), occupying it, and is continuing to attack Bei Changshan Island.

[Our Qingdao Office, 4th] The National Army entered Muping on the morning of the 4th, and the remaining bandits collapsed eastward. The National Army in the Kui Jia Mountain area took advantage of the victory to advance and launched a mop-up operation in the mountain area. Kui Jia Mountain is the last stronghold of the Communist bandits in the Jiaodong area. Once the mop-up is completed, the bandit's mountain nests will be completely destroyed. The National Army is also advancing in multiple directions towards Wendeng and Weihaiwei.

[Our Jinan Office, 4th] The National Army advancing towards the Shandong Peninsula is engaged in fierce fighting with the Communist bandits in the area near Muping to Haiyang. One unit is advancing towards Wendeng and Weihaiwei. Currently, there are about 2,000 bandits each in Weihaiwei and Haiyang, and the National Army is gradually clearing them out.

[Our Weixian Office, 4th] The area south of Changyi, west of Tingkou, east of Zuoshan, between the Weijiao and Weihe Rivers, and west of the Weihe River is currently the most intense battle area in Shandong. The Communist bandits have concentrated as many as four columns there, including part of the 9th and 13th Columns, which came from Jiaodong. The remnants of the 7th Column and 2nd Column, originally near Zhucheng, also fled north to join them starting on the 2nd, strengthening their forces in an attempt to prevent the National Army's encirclement. The National Army is launching a combined land and air operation to encircle and suppress them in the area.

[Our Jinan Office, 4th] Shandong has entered the stage of suppression operations. Since the main forces of the Communist bandits Liu Bocheng and Chen Yi suffered major blows from the National Army and successively abandoned their Shandong base, which they had managed for ten years, and fled south to the Yu, Wan, E, and Su areas, within Shandong, besides the remnants of Chen Yi's four columns in the area south of Changyi and east of Zuoshan, which the National Army is continuing to clear out, one column originally on the north bank of the Yellow River has moved from Deping to Dexian in the northern section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway. The other two columns, remaining in the area between Yuncheng and Caoxian in southwestern Shandong, have retreated towards the Dongping Lake and Liangshanbo area since the 2nd due to the National Army's attacks. The National Army is pursuing them, and it will not be difficult to annihilate them completely. Therefore, commentators believe that in order to successfully complete the military suppression of bandits in Shandong, the focus should be on passively destroying the Communist bandits' local administrative organizations, economic institutions, and remaining military strength, and actively rebuilding local armed forces to truly improve grassroots politics.

### Yantai is Almost Entirely Deserted

[Central News Agency, Yantai, 4th] The Communist bandits have occupied Yantai for two years, and the market has become almost entirely deserted. Most stores have no goods to sell after resuming business. There is a severe shortage of sugar and fuel in the city. Although the power plant has been repaired, the coal stored in the power plant is only enough for ten days. The bandit currency held by the citizens has become worthless. The banks have not yet reopened, and the financial situation is suffocating. Postal and telegraph services have also not resumed, causing inconvenience to all parties. The authorities have telegraphed the Central Bank and the Postal and Telegraph Administration to resume operations quickly.

[Our Xuzhou Office, 4th] Chen Bandit's dream of crossing the Tianjin-Pukou Railway to flee back to northern Jiangsu with his 1st, 3rd, 6th, and 8th Columns has been completely shattered. Forced to do so, they turned around and fled back to northwestern Anhui. Chen Bandit's 1st and 6th Columns fled to Taihe on the 3rd and continued to eye Fuyang. His 3rd and 8th Columns fled from the southwest of Suxian to the Mengcheng and Guoyang area on the 3rd. A strong group of National Army soldiers marching south from Yongcheng is joining forces with the National Army forces pursuing from the southwest of Suxian to launch a brave pincer attack on Chen Bandit. A major annihilation battle is expected north and south of the Huai River.

[Our Xuzhou Office, 4th] The main force of Liu Bocheng's remaining bandits has been driven from the Daxiao Mountain area to southern Henan by the National Army and has been cut into three sections. The main force of their 2nd and 6th Columns is currently surrounded by the National Army in the area south of Gushi. Their 1st and 3rd Columns and parts of the 26th Columns are being encircled and annihilated by the National Army in the Baiquanyuan and Shuanglun River areas south of Guangshan and north of Jingfu. Two to three thousand men from their 7th Column are currently trapped in the military encirclement in the Zhou Dangfan and Pan Xindian areas south of Luoshan.

### Our "Compensation and Restitution" Committee Investigates Japanese Industrial Equipment, About 100 Factories Available for Compensation

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 3rd] Our "Compensation and Restitution" Committee has investigated nearly 100 Japanese factories in Tokyo, Osaka, and Nagoya to prepare for receiving compensation goods. Some representatives of the committee will go to Osaka on the 5th to investigate four chemical factories there. The factories that Chinese representatives have already investigated in Tokyo, Osaka, and Nagoya include 43 machine tool factories, 17 ball bearing manufacturing factories, 3 Changri factories near Tokyo, 19 shipyards, 8 steel factories, and 6 sulfuric acid factories.

[Our Nanjing Office, 4th] According to the Compensation Committee of the Executive Yuan, the first batch of Japanese compensation machine tools and related metal processing equipment totals 19,561 units, of which we drew 9,780 units, weighing approximately 40,000 metric tons. The above machine tools were dismantled from 17 existing naval and army arsenals that have not been relocated by the occupying forces. In terms of quantity, it accounts for 28.1% of all compensation machine tools, and in terms of value, it accounts for 28.5% of the total. However, the original valuation by the Allied Headquarters was too high, and representatives from China, Britain, the Netherlands, and the Philippines have proposed adjustment methods, which are currently being discussed. It is estimated that the machinery and equipment we have drawn may be shipped in November of this year.

### Measures for Handling Applications After Importing Goods with Self-Provided Foreign Exchange, Executive Yuan to Decide and Announce Implementation Soon

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 4th] Regarding the post-application for importing various goods purchased and transported from abroad with self-provided foreign exchange, estimated to be worth more than US$40 million, the spokesman of the Executive Yuan said that the handling measures are currently being discussed by many experts and will be decided and announced for implementation soon. However, the ordering of these goods was not applied for permission in advance according to the law, and they were shipped to China without authorization, which is obviously inconsistent with the government's laws and regulations on trade and foreign exchange management. If permission is granted for import, the prerequisite is that the proceeds from the sale of these goods in the country will not be used to purchase foreign exchange on the black market, disrupting the financial market and affecting national interests. Some of these goods are daily necessities that are lacking in the country, and the government will pay special attention to the handling of these goods. Furthermore, the current value of these goods in the country is much higher than the profit calculated at the time of ordering. If permission is granted for import, how to avoid excessive profits and prevent continued operations is also under study. After the research is completed, it will be submitted to the Executive Yuan for discussion and decision before implementation.

### Leader of Xinjiang Rebel Army, Talier Khan, Expelled, Commissioner of Altai Prefecture Returns to His Post

[Central News Agency, Dihua, 4th] Liu Mengchun, Chairman of the Propaganda Committee of the Xinjiang Provincial Government, stated at a press conference today in response to reporters' questions that Usman, the Commissioner of Altai Prefecture, and his troops have returned to Altai, and the rebel leader Talier Khan has been expelled from Chenghua. Liu stated that since the government signed a peace agreement with the riotous people of the Ili-Tarbagatai-Altai area, affairs in the three areas are handled by the three areas before the formal entry of the National Army into the two areas. Therefore, Usman's return to Altai is a matter within the scope of the three areas, and Usman's entry into Chenghua in the fastest possible time shows that the people are extraordinarily supportive of him. The Altai problem is not a military problem, but a political problem. As for the consistent attitude of the National Army, it is to strictly abide by the peace agreement and not to enter any area of the three areas before the entire military problem in the three areas is resolved. Usman is the officially appointed Commissioner of Altai Prefecture by the government, and it is legitimate for him to maintain normal contact with the provincial government. If the Commissioners of the Tarbagatai and Ili Prefectures are willing to maintain normal contact with the government, the situation is the same.

### First Northeastern Victory: The Fifth Division of Bandits Annihilated Southwest of Siping; Crack Troops of the National Army Continuously Enter the Northeast to Reinforce

[Our Correspondent in Changchun, 4th] The National Army at Shuangmiaoz, 28 kilometers southwest of Siping Street on the China Changchun Railway, launched an annihilation battle yesterday. The most elite Fifth Division of Chen Zhen's Second Column of the Communist bandits was completely wiped out. The bandits fled from the south of Bamiancheng, with a small number of remnants fleeing back to Bamiancheng in disarray. Furthermore, Changgang and Quantou, important stations on the Changchun-Shenyang section, have fallen into the hands of the bandits. The National Army also made a planned retreat from Gongzhuling at 10:00 PM last night. Wherever the bandits went, bridges and sleepers along the way were either burned or blown up. There is absolutely no concern about the defense of Changchun City. Although the Communist bandits currently probing their advance towards Changchun from the two wings of Mengjiatun, artillery fire was heard in the city last night. However, military observers point out that, up to now, Changchun has only been under attack from the south, while the other three sides remain calm. Therefore, the Communist bandits' lack of ambition for Changchun is self-evident. Moreover, Changchun City's defenses are as solid as gold, and it is by no means something the Communist bandits dare to covet. The atmosphere and morale within the city are exceptionally peaceful. However, due to speculation by merchants, prices have fluctuated greatly.

[Our Correspondent in Shenyang, 4th] The sixth offensive of the Northeastern Communist bandits is expanding. Troops from north of the Songhua River, Shandong, Jehol, and Hebei are being transferred to southern Liaoning, eastern Liaoning, and the major strongholds surrounding Pan Yang. It is reported that crack troops of the National Army from within the passes have been continuously entering the Northeast. The Beining Railway can be fully opened to traffic in the short term, which will be the key to reversing the situation. Shenyang has announced twelve articles of martial law, with death penalty for violators. Chen Cheng has instructed all parties to remain calm and suppress prices. (Note: Today, prices here have skyrocketed, especially for rice and flour. Many people have been arrested by the authorities for refusing to sell.) Chen Cheng also held talks with industrial and mining personnel on the 4th, with Northeastern elder Wang Shuhan also in attendance. He then met with Zheng Dongguo, who had just flown back from Jinzhou, listened to his report, and discussed current military issues. The power transmission line from Fengman Power Plant has been cut off by the bandits, suspending the transmission of 4,000 kilowatts of power, and a portion of the Tiexi factories have suspended work. The Communist bandits abandoned the stations of Shoushan, Lishan, and Lishan on the southern section of the China Changchun Railway on the morning of the 4th. Fierce battles are taking place outside Anshan, with the National Army firmly defending. Haicheng, a key town in southern Liaoning (120 kilometers from Shenyang), fell into the hands of the bandits on the 4th. A large number of Communist bandits are gathering in Niuzhuang, between Haicheng and Yingkou, posing a great threat to Yingkou and Anshan. Yingkou has suddenly reported heightened tensions. The emergency repairs to the Shiqiaozi Station on the Shenyang-Benxi line have been completed and will be open to traffic on the 5th. Fierce fighting is taking place at Zhonggu Station on the northern route. The Qinghe Bridge, five kilometers north of Kaiyuan, which had been painstakingly repaired with sleepers, was set on fire and destroyed by the bandits on the 3rd. The bridge is over 600 meters long and has suffered considerable damage. The Changtu military station has been abandoned, and contact with Kaiyuan was lost here after noon on the 4th. It is reported that it has fallen into the hands of the bandits. The National Army in Xifeng and Faku have both shifted defenses in recent days. A large number of bandits are gathering in the southwest of Xingcheng, with intentions to attack Huludao. Furthermore, the damaged section of the railway between Xinmin and Juliuhe has been repaired, and traffic on the Shenyang-Jinzhou section is scheduled to resume on the 5th.

[Our Correspondent in Beiping, 4th] The Hou Jingru Corps advancing north along the Beining Railway has recovered Zihuang, the next station after Qianwei, and the vanguard has advanced to Wanghu Station. (Military officials' comments on the war situation can be found in the lower left corner of page two.)

Weekly Forum

### On the Prospect of Gold

— Zhou Bodi

Why do countries around the world compete for gold, and even the socialist Soviet Union wants to retain gold? Generally speaking, it is because gold is an international currency, gold is the final payment tool between countries, and gold is a way to stabilize currency values. This is elaborated below:

Gold is an international currency. — Although the International Monetary Agreement did not create a new name for the international monetary unit, it stipulated that "the par value of a member country's currency shall be expressed in terms of gold as the common denominator, or in terms of the weight and fineness of the US dollar in effect on July 1, 1944" (Article IV, Section 1, Paragraph 1 of the Agreement). This gold used as a common denominator will be generated under the Keynes Plan as member countries utilize their overdraft rights.

Gold is the final payment tool between countries. — Although modern international payments are made through exchange or clearing, the final payment tool is still gold. Therefore, the International Monetary Fund stipulates that member countries (more than 40 countries) should pay part of their quota in gold upon joining, and should sell their gold to the Fund under certain conditions in exchange for their national currency. Member countries can also sell their national currency to the Fund in exchange for gold. The Fund itself can also exchange the currencies of various countries for gold. Member countries' buying and selling of gold must not exceed the limits stipulated by the par value. In this way, the external value of each country's currency is linked to gold, and paper currency and gold have a great sense of "water color connecting waves, waves connecting the sky." In the future, gold will still be the final payment tool between countries.

Gold is a way to stabilize currency values. — In the future, gold will not be the true foundation of currency, but it will still be a way to stabilize currency values. To make gold the true foundation of currency, the gold standard must be implemented; this gold standard can be either the gold coin standard with free coinage as its backbone, or the gold bullion standard with unlimited buying and selling of gold as its backbone, both are acceptable. But in any case, in addition to free coinage or unlimited buying and selling, the free export or import of gold is still necessary. However, every country is willing to seize the gold of other countries, and mostly prohibits the export of its own gold. In this state, countries lacking gold cannot implement the gold standard, and countries with abundant gold are unwilling to implement the gold standard, because once implemented and the gold ban is lifted, gold will leak out. Without restoring the gold standard, the system of the Monetary Fund can still be used to stabilize the external value of currency. Stable external value will naturally be a driving force for stabilizing internal value.

In modern times, gold is more of a foreign exchange fund than a reserve for issuing currency. The external mission of gold will be more important than its internal mission.

Therefore, when it comes to gold policy, the most ideal thing is naturally for gold to be state-owned and used for external purposes. However, to implement state ownership of gold, confiscation would infringe on private rights and lose popular support; requisition would increase the issuance of banknotes and promote inflation; issuing gold bonds to exchange for gold would be subject to voluntary subscription and would not easily see immediate results. Therefore, state ownership of gold is not easy to implement for the time being, and there is no need to implement it temporarily. Because people absorb gold to preserve currency values, and because the absorption of gold raises the black market price of gold, this is certainly a loss for individual buyers, but hiding wealth among the people may not be a loss for the entire national economy.

The United States is a country with abundant gold. If it were to issue banknotes with all of its gold as reserves, it would definitely cause inflation. Therefore, the United States purchases gold that flows in. Purchases exceeding a certain amount are sold to the Federal Reserve Bank. The gold purchased is either allocated for storage or sold overseas. The price of this sale is $35 per ounce. This is the legal price.

Because the United States wants to prevent gold from having adverse effects on banknotes, it implements a gold sterilization policy, and selling gold abroad is one aspect of its gold sterilization policy. Therefore, its selling price is also particularly low. However, in the United States' free gold market, it is worth $42.75 per ounce. This is even $2.75 higher than my country's gold parity ($40). Fortunately, most of my country's gold is wholesaled at the legal price ($35). Although my country's parity is lower than the market price in the United States, it will not lose money.

The free price of gold in the United States is already above $42, and in places lacking gold, its free price will naturally be higher. For example, my country's parity is $40, while the free price in Macau is equivalent to $51. Even if this price is too high, $45 should be a very fair price, which is still $10 higher than $35. Generally speaking, gold prices in various countries around the world are higher than in the United States. According to incomplete figures, Mumbai has reached over $70, Cairo $108, and Athens $110. As for Chile and Brazil, they are closely following the United States, also at around $40. The higher the gold price, on the one hand, indicates a shortage of gold, and on the other hand, indicates a greater need for gold. Why is gold so needed? Isn't it because gold has the functions mentioned above?

In recent years, the people of my country have also particularly liked buying gold, perhaps due to inflation and the desire to use gold as a store of value. But in reality, inflation is not a strong reason for people to buy gold; because countries like Switzerland have not had inflation, but their people also like to buy gold. The price of gold in Switzerland is very high, and to export it abroad, a passport is required. Even so, the outflow of gold is still torrential. Therefore, since the beginning of September this year, the National Bank of Switzerland has stopped selling gold.

From the above, it can be seen that gold still has its special functions in the future world. Except for the United States, which is willing to release a portion of its gold from the perspective of adopting a gold sterilization policy, the remaining countries are trying to collect gold, or passively prevent the loss of gold. Because the United States is willing to release a portion of its gold, gold prices have a parity point; because countries want to collect gold, gold prices have uneven peaks.

My country's current gold, although it cannot be state-owned, has been banned from free trading. Banning free trading means freezing gold, so that those who hold gold cannot exchange it for currency and circulate it on the market, which is helpful for currency contraction. However, gold is valuable but small, it can be hidden in sleeves without anyone noticing, and private transactions are difficult to detect. Therefore, although inspections are strict, the black market price is difficult to eradicate. The existence of the black market is almost unavoidable, but compared to the turbulent and surging public market price, its stimulus to prices is much weaker. The black market price of gold only plays a follow-up role on prices, it will not play a leading role. This is the biggest benefit of banning the free trading of gold.

Conversely, if we want to eliminate the black market and open up gold, then there will be one more stimulus to price fluctuations, another opportunity for speculation in the market, and more chips in the market, and the flames of inflation will be poured with flammable oil. Therefore, I believe that gold should not be opened up at this time.

However, there are originally two types of people who buy gold. One is the civilian class, who accumulate a small amount of funds and buy some gold jewelry on a regular basis to use as savings; the other is speculators or the wealthy class, who buy and sell gold in large quantities to seek profits. We can freeze and prohibit the trading of gold for the latter type of people, but from the standpoint of social policy, it is not appropriate to completely prohibit gold for the former type of people. (See my book "The Past and Future of Gold Policy")

Secondly, the suspension of gold trading by silver shops has caused many people to lose their jobs. Opening up the trading of gold jewelry would also be a way to provide relief.

However, the trading of jewelry by silver shops must be subject to appropriate control. This control should not be too strict (too strict will cause an imbalance between supply and demand), nor should it be too lenient (too lenient will cause many malpractices). This includes the issue of purchase prices. Now we assume that the purchase price for silver shops is the legal price of $40. Then those who are willing to exchange jewelry for silver shops will provide a source of gold for the silver shops. However, in the country, in addition to the legal price of $40, there may also be a black market (such as $51 in Macau). If the black market is higher than the legal price, then people will not be willing to sell gold to silver shops, and the silver shops will not be able to balance their buying and selling. At this time, the silver shops will inevitably hope to raise the selling price in order to seek supplies in the black market with their remaining profits, so that they can balance their buying and selling. In this situation, the silver shops will still have profits, but the most disadvantaged are the poor sellers, who have no choice but to sell their only gold at a low price due to the necessity of life.

Therefore, whether the purchase price for silver shops should absolutely be based on the legal price is worth discussing. I believe that as long as the quantity of purchases is controlled, the purchase price does not necessarily have to be based on the legal price. It is also okay to use the black market price. In this way, the selling price and purchase price of silver shops will not be too far apart, and buying and selling will be easier to balance.

The above method is equivalent to opening up the small-scale buying and selling of gold. Will this cause malpractice? I believe that this is okay. It is like building a dam on a river with a very steep slope to prevent the torrent from rushing down and protecting vast fields, that is the gold ban. But a small gate can still be opened in that dam to allow a small stream of water to flow continuously and irrigate the fields, that is the trading of gold by silver shops. Prices will not be stimulated to rise because of the rise in the price of gold jewelry. Because gold jewelry does not occupy an important position in the composition of the price index. The reason why the price of gold affects prices is because of its large-scale buying and selling, which affects prices through financial relations. Therefore, the price of gold alone (without going through finance) is not a collaborator of prices. This point also seems to be worth our attention.

The trading of gold jewelry by silver shops will be opened again soon, but because the buying and selling price relationship has not been settled, it seems difficult to recover smoothly for a while. According to the report on September 17, the purchase price is $40 and the selling price may be $68. The buying and selling prices seem to be too far apart. Needless to say, because the purchase price is based on the legal price, the selling price has to be raised even higher. However, as mentioned above, this may be detrimental to the poor and may instead easily promote black market transactions.

My conclusion is that the free trading of gold should continue to be prohibited at this time, but the small-scale trading of gold jewelry may be opened up, and when opened, the quantity, form (made into jewelry), and quality must be strictly controlled, but it is not necessary to rigidly stipulate its purchase price.

### Annual Meeting of the Institute of Engineers

(Continued from page one) Mr. Ling said: This issue has been consulted with experienced supervisors and auditors in transportation, economy, resources, water conservancy, municipal administration, and other public utilities, and valuable opinions have been obtained for reference. Members are requested to express their opinions as much as possible. Yang Jiceng, Shen Yi, Ge Fuxiang, Xia Guangyu, Zhao Zukang, and others spoke in succession. General opinion is that the preventive attitude imposed on engineering by the current audit system should be reformed. The pre-audit should be changed to a post-audit, and the audits of administrative agencies and business agencies should be separated. In terms of personnel, the rigid way in which the Ministry of Personnel assesses talents based on their background and experience is considered unreasonable. It was decided to appoint Shen Yi, Zhao Zukang, Zheng Zhaojing, Lu Yujun, and Gu Yuzhen as examiners. Ling Hongxun personally convened the meeting to organize the conclusions based on the opinions expressed by the members, and then draft proposals for the general assembly to decide and submit to the government for adoption. The meeting adjourned at 12:30 pm.

At 2 pm, the various specialized engineering societies held group readings of papers. The papers of the Mining and Metallurgical Society included Zhou Zhihong's "Smelting of Iron" and Yue Dongxin's "High-Grade Acid Absorption Steelmaking Method for Smelting Poor Iron Ore." The papers of the Chemical Engineering Society included Chen 's "Gas Generation Equipment and Fuel Burning Equipment" and Fan 's "Coal-Fired Power Plant." The papers of the Aeronautical Society included Li Dingyi's "Calculation of Lift in Coherent Airflow." The papers of the Water Conservancy Society included's "Water Meter Annual" and Cheng Xuemin's "New Graphical Method for Flood Calculation." The papers of the Civil Engineering Society included Tang Zhizhi's "Working Stress of Timber in China." The papers of the Electrical Engineering Society included Shang's "Electronic Oscillation of Pentode Radar Tuning Tube." The papers of the Textile Engineering Society included Zhu Xianfang's "Developing My Country's Textiles to Lay the Economic Foundation for Industrialization," Jiang Yuanqi's "Research and Development Principles of China's Jute Industry," and Cai Niansu's "Research on American Dyeing, Printing, and Finishing Technology."

At 8 pm, there was an engineering lecture, with Hong Shen speaking on "National Railway Damage and Restoration" and showing a film.

Also: Zhao Zukang, chairman of the Shanghai Branch of the Chinese Institute of Engineers, is scheduled to return to Shanghai from Beijing on the morning of the 5th. All members of the Shanghai Branch will return to Shanghai on the 7th.

### Original Text of Zeng Yangfu's Opening Remarks at the Opening Ceremony of the Institute of Engineers' Annual Meeting

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 4th] The 14th Annual Meeting of the Chinese Institute of Engineers opened in Nanjing on the morning of the 2nd. Zeng Yangfu, the president of the association, gave a brief opening speech, the original text of which is roughly as follows:

This annual meeting is the first annual meeting held by our Chinese engineers in the capital after the end of the Anti-Japanese War, and its significance is particularly significant. I think all the engineers who participated in the annual meeting must have many thoughts.

Sun Yat-sen said: "After great destruction, there must be great construction." After eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, the national and people's public and private construction undertakings have been greatly damaged. Before the end of the Anti-Japanese War, the government announced the first phase of economic construction principles and drafted a five-year plan for material construction. President Chiang, in his book "China's Destiny," further proposed a ten-year construction outline and figures. Everyone hopes that post-war construction can start and proceed smoothly. However, just two years after the end of the Anti-Japanese War, construction calls have declined, which is inevitable. What is the reason for this?

This is because the slogan of post-war construction has two weaknesses.

Two Weaknesses of Post-War Construction

First: the construction plan is placed on peaceful negotiations with the Communist Party. "Peace" and "construction" have become inseparable nouns. From the perspective of us engineers, it is correct to say that construction is good with peace, but it is absolutely wrong to say that construction is impossible without peace. The Communist Party is an uncompromising party, and it is impossible to live in peace with it. Therefore, waiting for the successful peaceful negotiations with the Communist Party before starting construction is certainly even more impossible. If construction projects can be carried out, the people will have the opportunity to find employment and live in peace. Those people who are held hostage by the Communist Party will return to the factories and back to the farmland, and will never be driven by the rebels again.

Second: the construction plan is placed on international assistance. A country must rely on its own efforts before it can cooperate with foreign countries. However, under the constraints of unequal treaties for the past 100 years, we have developed a national inferiority complex and a sense of dependence, hesitating and looking around, which has hindered our confidence in establishing an independent and autonomous material foundation for the country and the nation. Over the past two years, the years have passed, but the construction of our public works and the development of national industries have not made major achievements, and the crux of the problem has not been this.

Driving Force for the Revival of Public Works

The question we want to study today is how to implement a construction plan in a society of private property and free enterprise? By answering this question, we can understand the position and responsibilities of public works in the construction plan. The so-called public works include railways, highways, water conservancy, ports, docks, and other public buildings, that is, projects that mobilize a large amount of manpower and benefit the public interest.

After a long period of war, the contraction of production and the decline of social purchasing power are inevitable phenomena. In order to promote the post-war economic revival, the country should pay attention to three things: first, devote itself to national public works; second, increase the production of agriculture, industry, and mining and increase the people's labor; and third, promote export trade. The above three have a mutually cooperative relationship, and public works are the hub of the entire system. The country invests in public works to rebuild damaged areas, to prosper well-maintained areas, and to increase employment opportunities for the people. As the people's income increases, social purchasing power becomes abundant, and the production of agriculture, industry, and mining will inevitably increase, and export trade can be promoted. Therefore, the driving force for post-war economic revival is entirely tied to the construction of public works.

In industrially developed countries, the prosperity and decline of the social economy are cyclical. The prosperity of the social economy often causes overproduction, which ends in economic weakness. The country can use public works to alleviate this cyclical panic. If the country invests in public works, it can reduce the severity of social and economic problems. Therefore, public works have become an important balancing force in social and economic development. Economists in Britain and the United States have begun to attach importance to national public works in recent years. China is an industrially backward country, so we should devote all our efforts to the construction of public works as the driving force for post-war economic revival. Sun Yat-sen's industrial plan was formulated after World War I, but his emphasis on public works is no different from that of the progressive economists in Britain and the United States after World War II. We are deeply proud of this prescient legacy, and we should study how we can implement it to restore the country's strength after the war. Today, I take this as my responsibility and encourage myself with it.

### Full Text of Hu Shi's Letter to the Central News Agency

(Continued from page one) The original text of Mr. Hu's letter is as follows: In my talks with reporters in Shanghai on September 5 and in Beiping on September 7, I talked about the ten-year plan to fight for academic independence, and mentioned the problem that the foreign exchange allocated to universities this year was too small. I cited the large amount of foreign exchange used for study abroad expenses this year as a comparison. Later, because several friends pointed out that the government's foreign exchange expenditure was more than just for study abroad, in mid-September, several reporters came to ask me. At that time, I mentioned several items about foreign exchange that I heard from friends in the South, one of which was that Mr. Feng Yuxiang and his colleagues received a total of 600,000 US dollars in one and a half years, and another was that the Resources Committee sent as many as 400 professional and technical personnel to the United States for investigation. Later, I received a letter from Mr. Xue Dubi, Minister of Water Resources, saying that "Mr. Feng was appointed to go to the United States to investigate water conservancy, and was approved to bring three secretaries and two water conservancy experts, a total of six people. The Executive Yuan approved the issuance of investigation fees three times, totaling 360,000 yuan in national currency and 50,200 US dollars in June of the 35th year, and 23,800 US dollars in July of the 36th year. The above total 360,000 yuan in national currency and 134,000 US dollars, all of which were directly allocated by the Ministry of Finance and notified to our ministry by the Executive Yuan." I also received a letter from Mr. Weng Wenhao, Chairman of the Resources Committee, saying that "The Resources Committee has sent a total of about 400 interns to the United States before and after the war. Among them, the main ones are the Lend-Lease Act interns, who were handled according to the government's circular. After the North Heavy Machinery Plant met in May, due to the country's difficult foreign exchange situation, it immediately ordered all interns to return to the country early. More than 250 people have now returned to the country, and another 60 or so are waiting for a ship to return to the country. At present, there are less than 100 people still in the United States, and they will return to the country after the internship expires." I now formally request the Central News Agency to publish this letter for me to correct my mistakes last month. I take this opportunity to formally apologize to Mr. Feng Yuxiang and the Resources Committee. As for Mr. Feng Yuxiang's open letter about his buying houses and land, I never talked about it at all, so of course I don't need to answer him. Hu Shi, October 4, 36th year.

### CNA Airfares to be Adjusted Starting Tomorrow; Decision to Increase the Taipei-Tainan North Line

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 4th] China National Aviation Corporation has been ordered by the head office to readjust airfares as follows starting on the 6th of this month: Air Master aircraft, Shanghai-Beiping, 4.1 million yuan. "C47" type, Shanghai-Beiping, 3.15 million yuan; Beiping-Nanjing, 2.8 million yuan; Beiping-Qingdao, 1.45 million yuan; Beiping-Jinan, 800,000 yuan; Beiping-Tianjin, 250,000 yuan; Beiping-Taiyuan, 1 million yuan; Beiping-Suiyuan, 700,000 yuan; Beiping-Shenyang, 1.15 million yuan; Shenyang-Beiping, 100,000 yuan (Northeast currency); Beiping-Chongqing, 3.95 million yuan; Beiping-Hankou, 2.35 million yuan.

[Central News Agency, Taipei, 4th] China National Aviation Corporation has decided to increase the Taipei-Tainan route starting on the 7th, every Tuesday and Friday, with one round-trip flight on the same day. The one-way fare is 9,100 Taiwan dollars.

### Central Airlines Plans Traveler's Insurance

[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 4th] The Central News Agency learned today from the Central Air Transport Corporation here that the company is planning to offer travel insurance to all passengers flying on its aircraft between China and foreign countries. Several well-known British insurance companies here have submitted applications to serve as the travel insurer for Central Airlines. However, the company has not yet decided which company will be awarded the contract. According to the company's plan, each passenger will pay an additional insurance fee for each HK$10,000 in coverage, in addition to the travel fare. The company manager said that all its flight personnel, including pilots, radio operators, and stewardesses, about eighty in total, are insured by the insurance department of the Jardine Matheson Company, with coverage of HK$50,000 per person.

### Wuhan Grain Prices Fall Back

[Our Newspaper, Hankou, 4th] Grain prices in Wuhan City fell back today. Top-grade rice fell to 360,000.

### Prices Soar in Beiping

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 4th] After the announcement of the increase in train fares, prices in Beiping today have burst like a dam, especially for daily necessities such as food, grain, and cloth. Today, first-grade flour is selling for 280,000, and top-grade rice has exceeded 7,000 yuan per catty. Forty-yard Indanthrene cloth is priced at 1.2 million. Dragonfly brand and Five Blessings brand have also risen from over 5 million around the Mid-Autumn Festival to 730,000. Coal is also being actively traded. Other metals, foreign goods, building materials, and other necessities are also rising in price.

### Prices in Xuzhou Skyrocket

[Our Newspaper, Xuzhou, 4th] Prices in Xuzhou have skyrocketed. Today, top-quality fine cloth is 720,000 per bolt, white rice is 82,000 per斗, and kerosene is 3.1 million per large barrel.

### Prices in Qingdao Rise Madly

[Our Newspaper, Qingdao, 4th] Prices in Qingdao City have risen madly in recent days. This morning, the opening prices for various goods reached a new high. 32-count Silver Moon yarn broke the 20 million mark, Double Dragon cloth reached 650,000, and Bingchuan flour was quoted at 280,000 wholesale, with retail prices exceeding the 300,000 mark. Rice was 850,000, and wheat tips were out of stock with no transactions. Kerosene has broken 3 million, and black indigo powder and caustic soda are both about to break 30 million. In addition, rubber, paper, western medicine, sugar, and tobacco are all rising steadily. The reasons are that the purchase and transport of food from producing areas are restricted, imports have decreased, and exports of yarn and cloth are brisk, leading to frantic buying. The resulting impact is that the price surge has become unstoppable.

### Northeast Improves Foreign Trade, Emergency Economic Measures Abolished

[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 4th] There is a major reform in Northeast foreign trade today. The Northeast Emergency Economic Measures Act, promulgated on May 10th, has been abolished by the Northeast Headquarters today. New measures have been promulgated for the export of soybeans and trade between Guan Nei and Guan Wai. Anyone exporting soybeans may apply for a permit by presenting an exchange settlement certificate and a letter of credit. For domestic sales of soybeans, restrictions have been imposed to encourage the soybean oil and soybean cake processing industry in the Northeast. The export of soybean oil and soybean cake is completely free. However, in order to take into account the domestic oil industry and avoid private enterprises competing for domestic sales, which would reduce exports, it is stipulated that domestic sales of soybeans are only allowed to be handled by the Central Trust Bureau or similar state-owned institutions. For general trade, except for the permitted and prohibited categories, all goods can be freely exported. All previous differential duties are abolished. In the past, exports to Guan Nei were subject to trade controls, while imports were free. Now, both exports and imports are within the scope of the plan and are allowed to be free. The Northeast lacks yarn, cloth, flour, kerosene, gasoline, newspapers, and麻袋. What it has in abundance are the metal materials listed in the permitted export category, such as raw steel plates, angle iron, iron pipes, copper plates, copper wires, copper pipes, and bamboo steel. Anyone importing materials urgently needed by the Northeast may apply to export the Northeast's surplus metal materials by presenting a shipping manifest, invoice, and tax bill. In this way, the main import and export goods will be mutually traded and sold, and remittances from the Northeast to Guan Nei can be expected to decrease, and prices can stabilize.

### Personnel from the Democratic League Participate in the Pseudo-Northeast Administrative Committee, Yan Baohang and Others Serve as Pseudo-Provincial Chairmen

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 4th] Sources say: The Communist bandits' pseudo-Northeast Administrative Committee was established on August 15, 1946. The full name of the committee is the Administrative Committee of the Pseudo-Northeast Provincial and Municipal Joint Office. It was elected by the "Northeast Provincial and Municipal Representative Conference" convened by the Communist bandits' Northeast Bureau in Harbin from August 7 to August 15, 1946. There are 27 administrative committee members, including Tibetans and Koreans. It is estimated that there are five members of the Democratic League among them. The pseudo-chairman of the committee is Lin Feng, the Communist bandits' Northeast Bureau Organization Minister and Director of the Political Department of the Pseudo-Northeast Democratic Allied Army. During the Anti-Japanese War, Lin was the Communist bandits' Jin-Sui Border Region Party Committee. After the surrender of the Japanese devils, he was sent by the Communist bandits to leave the Guan with Lin Biao, Lu Zhengcao, and others. The committee governs ten pseudo-provincial governments, four pseudo-municipal governments, and three pseudo-special administrative offices. Among the pseudo-provincial government chairmen, Gao Chongmin, Yan Baohang, and Yu Yifu, and the pseudo-Director of Education Han Tong (female), and Guan Mengjue, are all members of the Democratic League. From July 18 to the end of July this year, the committee convened its first administrative meeting in Harbin to discuss how to support the Communist bandits' rebellion in the Northeast in the future. The list of members of the committee is recorded as follows: Lin Feng, Lu Zhengcao, Zhang Xueshi, Zhou Baozhong, Zhou Jingwen, Gao Chongmin, Yan Baohang, Yu Yifu, Ning Wu, Han Tong, Che Xiangchen, Deng Dapeng, Feng Zhongyun, Wan Yi, Su Youwen, Liu Lanbo, Cao Hongjing, Chen Xianzhou, Li Du, Li Yanlu, Guan Yanjun, Jin Guangxia (Korean), Xu Shouzhen, Zhu Qiwen, Song Shende, Hafunga, Temuer Baya (Ha and Te are Mongolians), and 27 others.

### Rooks to Come to China, to Depart from Washington Tomorrow

[Our Newspaper] General Rooks, Director of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), is scheduled to fly to Shanghai from Washington on the 6th of this month to discuss UNRRA's work in China with UNRRA and Chinese government personnel, including the winding up of UNRRA's work in China, the transport of supplies to the Communist areas, and the continuity of some projects after UNRRA's closure. Note: General Rooks came to China in May and June of this year to reorganize UNRRA's branch offices and to inspect the UNRRA working areas in five provinces. During that time, he met with Chairman Chiang and Marshall. This is his second visit to China.

### Macau Bans Gambling, Decides to Implement Gradually, Closing Three Gambling Tables Every Four Months

[United Press, Guangzhou, 3rd] Portuguese Consul Carvalhais said: The Macau authorities are determined to ban gambling. Three gambling tables will be closed immediately, and the remaining nine will be gradually closed as well. The gambling ban plan stipulates that three gambling tables will be closed every four months, so that by the end of 1948, all gambling tables will have disappeared. The Macau government originally intended to ban gambling immediately, but in view of the fact that about 15,000 people rely directly or indirectly on gambling for their livelihood, sudden unemployment would endanger their livelihoods. Gradual prohibition will allow these people to gradually change their occupations. Macau has natural scenery, and the authorities plan to open it as a tourist area to attract tourists. The smoking of opium has been effectively prohibited since July of this year.

### Outline for the Implementation of Constitutional Government

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 4th] In order to awaken the people of the country to the understanding of constitutional government, the Information Bureau of the Executive Yuan has formulated the "Outline for Expanded Publicity on the Implementation of Constitutional Government," which has been submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and sent to the Central Propaganda Department, the Information Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense, the Ministry of Education, the Constitutional Promotion Association, and the provincial and municipal governments to assist in the publicity, and has telegraphed the provincial and municipal information offices and the Shanghai and Peiping offices to launch the publicity. The outline is divided into four parts: A. Foreword. B. Key Points of Publicity: Awaken the people's understanding of constitutional government; publicize the advantages of the Constitution of the Republic of China; the efforts that the people should make for the implementation of constitutional government. C. Publicity slogans. D. Publicity methods: Meetings, written materials, oral presentations, popular forms, artistic expressions, and other methods.

### National Assembly Election Voting Postponed, Election Schedule Changed, Election Certificates to be Issued at the End of This Month

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 4th] Because the voting for the National Assembly election has been postponed by one month, the election schedule will be changed as follows:

August 23 is the deadline for organizations to participate in the election (that is, 90 days before the election). Organizations that have been legally established and have applied for registration before the above deadline may also participate. October 26 is the deadline for the election authorities to prepare the voter lists. October 27 to October 31 is the date for public announcement, correction, and submission of the voter lists, and election certificates will be issued at the same time. This decision has been passed at the 5th meeting of the Occupational Groups and Women's Election Offices on the 4th.

### Luo Longji Makes Another Defense

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 4th] Luo Longji of the Democratic League entertained reporters on the evening of the 4th and made another defense against Huang Xianguang's remarks. He issued a written statement, attempting to deny everything regarding Yan Baohang and Zhou Jingwen. Finally, he said: "The Democratic League has its own independent political goals and its own absolutely independent policy. It opposes war and calls for peace. Even if there is any threat or oppression, the Democratic League will not change its original intention." When a reporter asked what they would do if the government asked them to go to the bandit areas, he replied that they would definitely go. At the same time, he advocated that the current domestic and foreign policies should be independent and autonomous, and should not rely on international aid. When the government wanted to announce the truth of the facts, he said: "It must be done with the participation of impartial people and international figures before it can be announced," which is mutually contradictory.

### Small Typhoon Between Hong Kong and Shantou, Wind Force Gradually Decreasing

### Military Official Talks About Confidence in the Military Situation in the Northeast, the National Army Will Surely Win if it Takes Steady Steps

[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 4th] A certain military official said: The Communist bandits' sixth offensive was initially disadvantageous to the National Army, but everyone can rest assured that the military situation is absolutely under control. The bandits have now mobilized 300,000 troops in the southeast, northwest, and northeast, and it is possible to increase it to 500,000 to 600,000. The main force of the bandits is in the Meihekou and Xi'an area, with about 150,000 troops. The target of the attack may be the heart of the Northeast, the Shenyang and Kaiyuan area, and a major battle may occur in the near future. The bandits in Faku Xinmin pose a great threat to Shenyang, and the defense of Shenyang may be aimed at this. Of course, the northern relationship is also great. The stability of the manpower in Shenyang can explain the general public's confidence in the war. Huludao is safe and the transportation on the Beining Road will also be ensured. Land and sea supply will be sought to be smooth, and there will be factual performance in the near future. In addition, Changchun, Jilin, and Siping are all strongholds of the National Army in the north and will be maintained with all efforts. The purpose of the bandits' sixth offensive is nothing more than to attack the National Army, destroy industry, mines, and transportation, plunder the autumn harvest, and occupy cities. The biggest goal may be Shenyang. In short, the so-called sixth offensive may be longer than the two-month period of the fifth offensive, or it may be more tragic, but the National Army will surely win victory, secure the Northeast, if it takes steady steps.

Analysis of the Battle Situation in Henan and Shaanxi

[Our Newspaper, Xi'an, 4th] Military strategists analyze the battle situation between the provinces of Henan and Shaanxi, saying: The Communist bandits in western Henan are attempting to attack Tongguan along the railway and enter eastern Shaanxi, and to enter southeastern Shaanxi along the Luhe River Valley Xinxi (An) Jing (Ziguan) highway. These two moves have been severely attacked by the National Army. Tongguan is always as solid as a rock. What is more difficult to clear immediately is only the scattered bandits who are broken up into pieces in the mountain areas of Shangnan and Shangxian in the southeast corner of Shaanxi. Among the bandit units that have been discovered in western , the numbers of the brigades are 17, 31, 32, 33, 55, etc., which may not all be the bandit troops that retreated from the Longju Village Zhang Village (two kilometers southeast of Shangxian City) and Rencun (30 kilometers east of the city) line in Shangxian County, because the National Army is densely deployed in Lantian and Shangxian Counties, so a part of them may have fled south to the mountainous area of Shanyang County, and their route may repeat the mistakes of Li Xiannian's unit. According to the Chief of Staff of the Shaanxi Security Command, the six counties in southeastern Shaanxi, including Shangxian, that is, the Fourth Administrative Special District, have very strong defense capabilities, and the bandit army will never succeed. It is also learned that the rainy season in this area is coming to an end, and the opportunities for the air force to take action will increase, and the battle results will be greater. In addition, the people in Shangxian County are nervous, but the market conditions are normal. A curfew is imposed at 10 pm, and middle schools have been suspended. The Fourth District Commissioner and the county chief are supervising the construction of city defense works.

### Security Council Orders the Committee of Three to Immediately Resolve the Indonesian-Dutch Dispute, Batavia Consular Corps Reports That the Ceasefire Order Has Not Taken Effect, Gromyko Accuses the Netherlands of Being an Aggressor

[United Press, Chenggong Lake, 3rd] The United Nations Security Council tonight passed Australian Foreign Minister Evatt's proposal by a vote of nine to zero, ordering the Committee of Three of Belgium, Australia, and the United States to immediately find a way to resolve the conflict between the Netherlands and Indonesia. The Soviet Union and Poland abstained. Earlier, the Security Council had received the report of the investigation team, which stated that there were still serious battles in the East Indies, as well as looting and killing of people, especially overseas Chinese in Java and Sumatra. The Soviet Union's proposal that the Dutch and Indonesian troops simultaneously withdraw to their original defense areas was postponed to the next meeting on Tuesday for discussion. The Consular Investigation Team's report stated that in the current situation, the ceasefire order is difficult to fully implement, and the reason for the continued conflict between the two countries is the failure to demarcate the border. The report also stated that Dutch troops had invaded Indonesian territory in several places between July 20 and August 4. Between these invaded areas, there are still Indonesian regular troops and guerrillas. After the Security Council issued the ceasefire order, the Dutch and Indonesian governments announced that they intended to fully restore law and order within the defense lines they had designated, and disarm all armed organizations. The defense lines they designated connected the forward positions that they had invaded Indonesian territory with, thus including Indonesian regular troops and guerrillas within them. This line of defense is not acceptable to Indonesia, so skirmishes between sentries and guerrilla sniper attacks occur from time to time. This is the crux of why the ceasefire order cannot take effect.

[Associated Press, Chenggong Lake, 3rd] During the Security Council's discussion of the Indonesian-Dutch dispute today, Soviet representative Gromyko delivered a lengthy speech in Russian, in which he attacked "certain governments" for hoping to keep the Consular Corps' report strictly confidential. "The Dutch government's words and deeds are consistent, because the Netherlands has said that if the Security Council's recommendations do not suit its intentions, it will ignore them." He said that certain governments support the Netherlands. Without this support, the Netherlands would not dare to make such remarks rashly, nor would it dare to despise the Security Council's resolutions. Gromyko also accused the Dutch government of being an aggressor and reiterated the Soviet Union's demand that both sides withdraw to the positions they held before the start of the war. Gromyko said that the Indonesian people are suffering from abuse and that they are resisting an aggressor country, so their scorched earth tactics are justifiable. Dutch Ambassador to the United States Kleffens then spoke, expressing regret to Gromyko for calling the Netherlands an aggressor. He said that the Committee of Three would be powerless until the violence stopped in Indonesia and a "good atmosphere" conducive to a solution was created.

[Associated Press, Batavia, 4th] The Dutch Aneta news agency learned that the US military observation team met with President Soekarno and Prime Minister Sjahrir in Yogyakarta today and is scheduled to return to Batavia on the 5th. The next meeting of the Consular Corps is scheduled to be held on the 7th.

### Trusteeship Committee of the General Assembly Launches Fierce Debate, Britain Defends the Colonial System, Our Country's Representative Maintains a Fair Position

[Central News Agency, Chenggong Lake, 3rd] Colonial countries and countries without mandates engaged in a fierce debate yesterday in the Trusteeship Committee over whether colonial countries should include political information in their annual reports on the conditions of their "non-self-governing territories." Previously, the Egyptian representative proposed that the administering states should include information on the political activities of their non-self-governing territories in their annual reports, and the British representative immediately spoke in defense of the colonial system.

He said that reporting the political activities in non-self-governing territories to the United Nations would be tantamount to organizing an international political conference, thereby interfering in matters relating to the administering country and its colonial people. The Soviet representative immediately criticized the British opinion and called Britain a defender of the colonial system. Our representative Zheng Zhenyu believed that although the Charter did not expressly order the administering states to submit political information on the non-self-governing territories, in accordance with the spirit of the Charter, this report should be submitted to the General Assembly.

### Debate on the Greek Question, Polish Representative Speaks

[Our Newspaper] New York, 4th Broadcast: Chenggong Lake News, The Political Committee of the General Assembly continued to debate the Greek question. The first speaker today was Polish Foreign Minister Lange, who said that the Greek question is serious in nature and has a significant impact on world peace.

The reason for the outbreak of the civil war is precisely this.

### U.S. State Department Plans to Allocate 50 Million Dollars to France Within Two Weeks; Senate Democratic Leader Calls for Increased Aid to Europe

[Reuters, Washington, 3rd] It is reported that the State Department plans to provide France with $50 million in aid within two weeks. Meanwhile, President Truman held a cabinet meeting lasting an hour today to discuss plans for European relief and food storage. The source of funding for aid to France is currently unknown, but State Department officials believe that existing deposits can be used to prevent the complete halt of coal and grain shipments to France.

This $50 million, along with the $93 million worth of German-looted gold that France is expected to receive from the Brussels Three-Country Committee, will help France weather the critical period before Congress passes the $800 million interim aid package for France, Italy, and Austria. During today's cabinet meeting, the President and his cabinet members studied the recent report submitted by the President's Economic Advisory Committee.

[United Press, Waukegan, Illinois, 4th] Senate Democratic Leader Lucas told reporters on the 4th that the United States must be prepared to spend $10 billion over four years on Western Hemisphere defense unless Congress approves emergency aid to Western Europe by December 1st. He stated, "Europe is now extremely vulnerable to Communist infiltration, and if the Communist Party gains a foothold in the Western Hemisphere, we will face a real danger." He warned that if the Congressional committee hears the European relief plan and there are no results by December 1st, and then Congress is reconvened to consider the relief plan, it will be of no use.

### U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Calls on Citizens to Conserve Food to Aid Europe; Luckman Drafts Concrete Plan

[United Press, Washington, 4th] The U.S. government seems to have placed all its hopes for the urgent food needs of European aid on the voluntary cooperation of the American people.

Luckman, Chairman of President Truman's Food Committee, also plans to meet with representatives of the national brewing industry to seek their assistance in conserving food.

### Britain Implements Employment Controls

[Reuters, London, 4th] The Ministry of Labour announced last night that the employment control system will be implemented starting next week. Under this system, British industries will be divided into three categories to determine their priority for obtaining labour. The first category is the main agricultural and industrial sectors with labour shortages, such as agriculture, coal mining, textiles, and steel industries. Other important industries, such as the atomic energy industry, although not lacking in labour, can also receive the same priority when vacant positions occur.

The second category includes major industries that do not receive priority in recruiting labour, such as the engineering industry, food manufacturing industry, hospitals, and laundry industries.

### British Trade Minister Wilson Declares Willingness to Rebuild Trade Relations with the Soviet Union; British Empire Decides to Reduce Imports from the Dollar Area

### Major Embezzlement Suspected in Postal Savings and Remittances Bureau; Xu Jizhuang and Thirteen Other Officials and Businessmen Prosecuted According to Regulations on Punishing Corruption, Indictment Divided into Three Points, Listing a Huge Amount

[Report from Our Newspaper] Xu Jizhuang, former Director of the Postal Savings and Remittances Bureau, Zhang Jiu, Director of the Business Department, Ni Shurong, Director of the Audit Department, Shen Jing, former Director of the Postal Savings and Remittances Bureau's Shanghai Branch, Yu Zisong, former Deputy Manager, Zhang Zhirong, Accounting Section, Wu Yongnian, Head of the Business Section, Chen Gongpei, Compiler, Wang Xiangfa, Investigator, Li Liangfu, former Deputy Manager of the Shanghai Branch of Bachuan Bank, Jun Chuyi, Assistant Manager, Kong Guangxiao, former Chairman of Lida International Trading Company, Peng Bingcheng, Chairman of Yuanyang Trading Company, and other thirteen people, were previously reported to have suspected corruption. After investigation by Prosecutor Cao Hong of the District Procuratorate, the defendants were prosecuted according to Article 3, Paragraph 6, Article 1 of the Regulations on Punishing Corruption, Article 28, and Article 56 of the Criminal Law on the 3rd of this month. The original indictment is very long, and the general idea can be divided into three points: The part of the defendant Shen Jing and others. Regarding the purchase of remittances by the Shanghai Branch of the Postal Savings and Remittances Bureau, from November last year to February 2 of this year, remittances from Tianjin, Chongqing, Hankou, Kunming, Guangzhou, and other five places were purchased from the Shanghai Branch of Bachuan Bank, with a total amount of 3.65 billion yuan in national currency. Except for three drafts, totaling 800 million yuan in national currency, there are still eight outstanding remittances, totaling 2.85 billion yuan in national currency. Therefore, the Postal Savings and Remittances Bureau ostensibly buys remittances, but in essence, there is no factual remittance to other places, which is obviously a disguised interbank lending, taking advantage of the state bank's funds. The part of the defendant Shen Jing and Peng Bingcheng, Chairman of Yuanyang Trading Company. It was found that the Shanghai Branch of the Postal Savings and Remittances Bureau operated 157 bills of exchange, totaling 8.677 billion yuan in national currency. Among them, 1.347 billion yuan in national currency was remitted between Shanghai and Shantou, and Yuanyang Company guaranteed 16 firms. After investigation, it was found that all were fictitious, made to secure advances. The part of the defendant Xu Jizhuang and others. On March 26 of the 35th year of the Republic, the Postal Savings and Remittances Bureau and Kong Guangxiao, Chairman of Lida International Trading Company, signed a foreign currency import advance contract. Kong provided collateral, which was handled by Shen Jing, the former manager of the Shanghai Branch, who was responsible for safekeeping. The outstanding balance of the trade was more than 175,000 US dollars, and Lida Company had not yet cleared the arrears. The Shanghai Branch returned the collateral to Lida, which was not without fraud.

### Savings and Remittances Bureau Sues for Fraud; Yuanyang Chairman Does Not Appear in Court

### Speaker Pan Comments on the Selection of Senators; People from Both the Democratic and Youth Parties Are Welcomed to Be Elected; However, They Should Engage in Legitimate Election Activities in Accordance with the Law

[Report from Our Newspaper] Regarding the request from the Democratic and Youth Parties to revise the current regulations of the provincial, municipal, and county councils based on the policy guidelines, so that people from both parties can participate in public opinion organs through selection, the Municipal Council has previously listed reasons from legal and factual aspects, and telegraphed the Central Government to reconsider this proposal, so as to avoid the government being suspected of destroying laws, valuing parties over the people. Wang Shizeng, the spokesperson of the Chinese Back Year Party, also issued a statement on the 2nd of this month to debate it. The reporter specifically inquired about the opinions of the Municipal Council on this matter. According to Speaker Pan: The main condition for democratic politics is the spirit of abiding by the law. The formal councils of provinces, cities, and counties are public opinion organs and can only talk about laws, not factions, and even less about human feelings. There are many talents in the Democratic and Youth Parties, and many of them are usually friends. We will welcome them if they can be legally elected as senators. However, it must be known that no matter what party or faction a person belongs to, if they want to be a senator elected by the people, they should engage in their legitimate election activities within the scope of the law, and cannot resort to government selection. The promotion of democratic politics is the responsibility of every national citizen, and there is no need to be a representative of a public opinion organ before one can talk about democracy. As for the generation of national senators, according to the regulations on the organization of the National Political Council, there are two types, selection and election. Moreover, the nature of the Political Council is originally to gather ideas and broaden opinions, which cannot be compared with the provisions of the regulations of the provincial, municipal, and county councils. If the Democratic and Youth Parties really want to participate in local public opinion organs and be selected as senators, they can only try it out in the temporary council at most, and they must not involve the formal council. As for the Democratic and Youth Parties using participation in the election of supervisory committee members as a reason, this point has already been stated by this council.

[Report from Our Newspaper] Wu Yubao, 19, from Taizhou, was previously a soldier. Due to illness, he was hospitalized for a long time, and the team departed, which led to him wandering in Shanghai. Moreover, a set of clothes was also stolen by villains. At this point, he had no clothes or food and became a beggar. A few days ago, he was tricked by three thugs, Chen Keyun, Jiang Liming, and Xu Ziming, into the Longmen Hotel, where he stayed for two days, and promised to introduce him to a job.

### Shui Xiangyun and Others Visit Director Wu, Discussing Ways to Improve Rationing Issues

[Our Report] Shui Xiangyun, Chairman of the General Labor Union, along with union directors Liang Shuizhang, Qiu Changjiang, Zhang Ziheng, Zhou Fujiang, and others, visited Director Wu Kaixian of the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday morning. They stated that the cost of living index for workers this month has increased by 10% compared to last month, while the index for staff has increased by 15%. The reason is that workers have in-kind rations, but in fact, most factories have not applied for rationing to avoid trouble. Workers have not received the in-kind items, but the index is compiled based on the ration price, regardless of whether the rations are distributed or not. Therefore, although factories save on procedures, workers suffer greatly. Furthermore, vocational workers do not have rations. The Social Affairs Bureau was asked if there were any remedies. Director Wu stated that most factories had already received their rice rations. Regarding oil and coal briquette rations, the Civil Food Allocation Committee had repeatedly issued orders and published advertisements urging factories to apply and pay to collect them. 257,000 dan of coal briquettes were prepared, but only 150,000 dan have been collected so far, with no one else applying. Factories voluntarily giving up applications is not a crime, and the Social Affairs Bureau cannot force them. However, the workers are the ones who suffer, so it is hoped that the General Labor Union can notify the various labor unions to cooperate with the Social Affairs Bureau to urge factories to take responsibility for applying for rations. Although the application period for the first phase of coal briquette rations has ended, supplementary applications can still be accommodated.

### Workers' Coal Briquette Rationing: Four Points Agreed Upon

[Our Report] Director Wu Kaixian of the Social Affairs Bureau made a statement yesterday regarding the rationing of coal briquettes to industrial workers in the city. He said that the second phase of low-priced coal briquettes was originally scheduled to be completed by September 15th, but was later extended to September 25th, and the Civil Food Allocation Committee would issue all purchase permits before September 30th. However, the coal briquette factories refused to accept payment, citing that the ration price was too low. This has been strictly corrected, and payment will still be collected at the original price of 28,000 yuan per dan, and goods will be issued upon presentation of the permit. The following methods have been agreed upon with the Civil Food Allocation Committee:

*   All factories that applied before September 25th will be rationed if the procedures are complete.

*   For purchase permits issued before October 2nd, the payment and collection date will be extended to October 10th.

*   For purchase permits issued after October 3rd, if payment is not made to the coal briquette factory and goods are not collected within seven days as required, it will be considered a voluntary abandonment.

*   All coal briquette factories must collect payment and issue goods upon presentation of the permit. Any refusal will be severely punished.

The above methods have been publicly announced and ordered to be followed by the Machine-Made Coal Briquette Industry Association.

When asked if he knew Dai Moshui and Su Huabing, Su said that he only knew Su Huabing, but they had a long-standing feud, so he falsely accused him. The court ordered that the victim be summoned to court for a retrial.

### Five Peking Opera Theaters Cancel Night Shows Yesterday: Performers Strike in Anger Over Treatment - Returning to Normal Today, Awaiting Mediation

[Our Report] The five Peking opera theaters in the city, Tianchan, China, Huangjin, Dawutai, and Gongwutai, were forced to cancel their night shows last night due to a sudden strike by the performers demanding improved treatment. Tianchan suffered heavy losses due to audience disturbances. The Social Affairs Bureau sent personnel to mediate last night, and both labor and management agreed to resume work today and await mediation. Therefore, all theaters will perform as usual today.

The performing troupes of the five Peking opera theaters consist of more than 600 people. In the past, they all had fixed salaries, averaging between 680,000 and 700,000 yuan per person per month. In recent months, they have requested a change to the cost of living index, and after repeated discussions, the management has agreed in principle. However, the labor side initially insisted on a base salary of 60 yuan, and later repeatedly reduced it to 45 yuan, while the management only agreed to 35 yuan, and no compromise was reached. The Social Affairs Bureau summoned both parties for inquiries on this matter and scheduled another negotiation for tomorrow. Yesterday afternoon, representatives of labor and management negotiated again at Tianchan. Those present on the management side included Wang Qijun of China, Tang Pingfan of Tianchan, Fan Hengyu of Dawutai, Zhang Shanshan of Gongwutai, and Zhou Xiru of Huangjin. The labor side included Qiu Yucheng, Wu Sibao, and Guo Qingpeng. According to the labor representatives, Wang Qijun of the management insisted that the base salary could not exceed 35 yuan during the negotiation. The Tianchan side was quite willing to increase it to 40 yuan, but the other four companies insisted on 35 yuan, and misunderstandings arose in their words. After the labor representatives Qiu Yucheng and others reported the negotiation process to the public, the crowd was indignant and went on strike in anger.

### Where is Dr. Mei? Teacups Thrown on Stage

Yesterday was the weekend and the third performance of Mei Lanfang's "Hong Zong Lie Ma" at the Tianchan Theater. From 3 PM, audiences lined up at the Tianchan Theater to see Dr. Mei. The third floor was full before 5 PM. Waiting until 7:30 PM without the show starting, the audience on the third floor began to yell, then threw teacups at the stage, and threw long benches down from the third floor. Fortunately, the front-row audience had not yet taken their seats, and only the stage footlights, fans, and chair seats were slightly damaged, and no one was injured. At China, Huangjin, Dawutai, and Gongwutai theaters, the theater management, upon learning of the performers' strike, posted notices and requested the police to maintain order and assist in handling ticket refunds, and no accidents occurred.

### Loss of 200 Million Yuan - Rights to Compensation Reserved

According to Zhou Jianxing, manager of the Tianchan Theater, yesterday was the last day of Mei Lanfang's "Hong Zong Lie Ma" performance, and all the tickets had been sold out. The loss of ticket revenue alone reached 105 million yuan. The remaining losses, such as the salaries of front-desk staff, backstage workers, rent, water and electricity, celebrity performance fees, and ticket printing, are incalculable. At the same time, China suffered losses of 40 million yuan, Huangjin 30 million yuan, and Gongwutai and Dawutai each had 30 million yuan. The management expressed to Zhu Chenghao and Ge Mengsong, who were sent by the Social Affairs Bureau for mediation, that they reserved the right to demand compensation for such losses.

### The Strike Is Not the Labor Side's Intention

The person in charge of the Linge United Association, organized by the labor side, told reporters that the management had no sincerity and stopped the performance automatically, resulting in this deadlock. This was definitely not the labor side's intention. The association further pointed out that there were also contradictions between the management, because the business conditions of each theater varied greatly.

### 448 Million and 680,000

[Our Report] The "performing troupe" in Peking opera theaters includes extras, stage managers, musicians, costume keepers, and martial arts performers. In addition to earning a monthly salary of 680,000 yuan, they receive nothing else and must provide their own food and lodging. On the other hand, the performance fees of "Beijing big stars" are considerable. According to insiders, the distribution of performance fees for Mei Lanfang's troupe's performance at the Tianchan Theater this time, was as follows: Mei Lanfang 400 million yuan, Yang Baosen 120 million yuan, Xiao Changhua 80 million yuan, Li Duokui 70 million yuan, and Qian Baosen 40 million yuan. If the theater is sold out, it can earn 140 million yuan per day, including 5,000 yuan for tea and 2,000 yuan for programs. Therefore, calculated in this way, the sum total of 40 days, even if discounted by 20%, can reach 4.488 billion yuan. The labor side believes that compared with the 680,000 yuan they earn, there is a world of difference.

### Zhang Jixian Buried Yesterday - Solemn Memorial Service Held at Zhuangyan Temple in the Morning - Wu Tiecheng Delivered Eulogy

The family of the late Zhang Jixian, a member of the Senate and permanent director of the Xinwen Bao newspaper, held a memorial service for Zhang at Zhuangyan Temple on Taicang Road yesterday morning and then transported the coffin for burial at the Chinese Cemetery in Caohejing at 3 PM yesterday.

Secretary-General Wu Tiecheng of the Central Committee of the Kuomintang delivered a eulogy for Zhang, saying: "Ah, Mr., a talent from Hunan, dedicated to the country, concerned about the people. As a young man, he asked to join the revolution, assisting the founding father. The Battle of Hekou was a remarkable display of bravery. Failing in that endeavor, he went into hiding. Studying abroad, he achieved great academic success. Hunan raised an army, and the Han banner was easily planted. Summoned by the founding father, he entered Zhong Mi. Failing the Gui Chou revolt, he secretly entered southern Yunnan, where he ultimately realized his ambitions, overthrowing Yuan to restore the country. Geng Yan paved the northern road, Han Qi defended against Western Xia. As a military advisor, he promoted harmony among neighbors. There was further turmoil, hindering his efforts. Remaining loyal despite the obstacles, he faced the enemy. He participated in political affairs and finally achieved victory. Humble despite his merits, he refused to take credit. His discussions were clear and praised both at home and abroad. In this difficult time, with red eyebrows everywhere, we depend on experienced people to uphold righteousness. But heaven does not pity us and has taken away this wise man. The yellow bell has stopped ringing, and we miss his good voice. The evening waves of Dongting, the night rain of Xiaoxiang, the orchids will forever be fragrant, but where is his figure? I and the gentleman were allies in our early years, and even in times of hardship, we always remained devoted and sincere. We spoke late into the night in Sichuan and made tacit agreements in Shanghai. Our hearts were like clear water, sharing the same mysterious taste. Remembering the past, it feels like another world. The autumn wind is bleak, and the autumn rain is continuous. I sit up at night, as if hearing a sorrowful melody. Jixian, Jixian, how can my feelings stop? May your spirit be present here." Respectfully eulogized by Wu Tiecheng of Zhongshan.

### French Tram Workers' Strike Resolved - Eager Resumption of Work and Resumption of Operation

[Our Report] The French Tram Workers' Strike, which lasted for a week, was resolved at 4:30 PM yesterday. Twenty-two red buses, thirty trolleybuses, and forty-five trams have gradually resumed operation. According to Gu Ruofeng, Deputy Section Chief of the Mediation Section stationed at the union by the Social Affairs Bureau, almost all of the 2,700 employees of the French Water and Electricity Company have agreed to resume work unconditionally. Only about 30 people are unwilling to resume work, and it will be regarded as a waiver of the right to resume work, and the company will recruit unemployed workers to fill the positions.

Since the Shanghai newspapers published advertisements for the French Tram and Electricity Company's recruitment of new workers yesterday, there was a sea of people in front of the company's gate from 7 AM yesterday, and more than 3,000 people applied to register to work. The French workers knew that they could no longer persist in the strike, so they took the initiative to ask the Reorganization Committee to have Yun Long, Yang Jingen, Ye Jizhou, Cai Quanfa and others visit Director Wu Kaixian to request a final mediation opportunity. Director Wu agreed to extend the deadline to 5 PM. Yun Long and others left and then separately persuaded the workers to resume work. At around 3 PM, more than 700 workers from the Motor Department first went to the factory to resume work, and more than 200 outside workers from the Vehicle Department also came to the factory to report. The staff stationed at the factory by the Social Affairs Bureau and the Reorganization Committee of the Union instructed the drivers and ticket sellers of the Vehicle Department to first go home to change their uniforms and then come to the factory to work. At the same time, a red bus and a trolleybus were dispatched to Shanghai West and Shanghai South to pick up workers from the Vehicle Department to come to the factory. At around 4:15 PM, the workers were all wearing yellow uniforms and came to the factory in succession. The company authorities distributed ticket boxes and keys and assigned work. The first Route 22 bus (Zhao Hui No. 14988) left the factory to resume operation at 4:25 PM.

### Unemployed Older Workers Gather to Seek Work

More than 340 unemployed workers of the French Water and Electricity Company expressed their willingness to replace the striking workers at the beginning of the labor unrest. The Social Affairs Bureau and the company authorities also attached great importance to these skilled unemployed older workers. However, after all the original workers resumed work, the company no longer had any vacancies to accommodate these unemployed workers. At around 3 PM yesterday, while the company was busy with the resumption of work, the unemployed workers also came in groups to request the Reorganization Committee of the Union to provide them with work. After the Social Affairs Bureau and the Workers Welfare Committee sent personnel to explain and persuade them, they left, agreeing to discuss with all parties again today to decide on the proper handling.

### Post-Strike Arrangements for New Workers - To Be Decided After Consultation

### Safety of Resuming Workers Guaranteed

[Our Report] Director Wu Kaixian of the Social Affairs Bureau personally went to inspect the new worker registration site of the French Tram Company yesterday morning and went to the company to deal with general issues. In the morning, many workers declared to the company that they had no resentment towards the government or the company, and that they had been unable to resume work in recent days due to threats. They asked the company to notify the government to guarantee the safety of resuming workers, so that they could resume work in the afternoon. Director Wu stated that if workers came to the company to resume work before 4 PM, their safety would be absolutely guaranteed.

### Registration Continues Today

According to Director Wu, by 4 PM yesterday, workers who had registered to resume work at the French Tram Company accounted for seven-tenths of the total. Some workers still requested to resume work after the 4 PM deadline. It has now been decided that registration can still be processed today (the 5th), but it needs to be reviewed by the Social Affairs Bureau in conjunction with the company. If it is confirmed that they are good workers and were forced to strike under threat, they can still be allowed to resume work with the agreement of both parties. However, those who have been habitually misbehaving or have engaged in inciting strikes will not be allowed to resume work for the time being.

### Lu Jingshi Talks About the Labor Unrest Problem

Lu Jingshi, consultant to the Ministry of Social Affairs and chairman of the Workers' Welfare Association of this city, made the following statement yesterday on the problem of labor unrest in this city: "The labor unrest in this city in recent days is purely the result of communist elements lurking in the labor sector attempting to use the power of the masses to make a final struggle after the government arrested them. Fortunately, by concentrating our efforts and responding calmly in recent days, the communist's cunning plan has been completely defeated. The majority of good workers understand that the government's measures are entirely for the sake of maintaining production and workers' interests, so they have accepted the advice and resumed work entirely, and the labor unrest has ended. I sincerely hope that the workers in this city will be cautious and vigilant and will no longer lightly believe rumors. If there are still workers in the labor sector who have been coerced into joining communist organizations, I also hope that they will immediately surrender themselves, and the government will treat them with leniency and give them a final opportunity to rehabilitate themselves."

### Ancient Pagoda Overlooking Today's Battlefield – From Huaiyin, Watery Lianshui to...

[Report from Lianshui by our correspondent on the 1st] General Zhang Xuezhong, former Deputy Commander of the Third Front Army, was among the first group, along with General Tang Enbo, to fly to Nanjing and Shanghai to accept the surrender after the victory. The vivid impressions that General Zhang gave people during the early days of the War of Resistance in the Battle of Nankou, the Battle of Taierzhuang, and the counter-offensive battles of Liuzhou and Guilin in the later stages of the war are still deeply etched in everyone's minds. In March of this year, after firmly defending Lincheng, he came to northern Jiangsu to take on this arduous responsibility as the Commander of the Huaihai Pacification Area.

Commander Zhang

When interviewed by reporters, he put forward the two guidelines he insisted on: First, to universally and closely connect with all levels of society, and work together to fight against and suppress the bandits. Second, within the troops themselves, to actively strive for mobile warfare to crush the crafty bandits' old tricks.

The security of the canal route is mostly the responsibility of the self-defense forces, while the stationed troops set out at any time to suppress the bandits as opportunities arise. The canal line, from Huaibei to Xuzhou in the north and Jiangdu in the south, is now very stable, and transportation is also very safe.

Regarding the organization of the people, the Huaihai Pacification Area has now begun to handle it. As Commander Zhang said at the opening ceremony of the Huaiyin People's Movement Cadre Training Class: "Preventing bandits and suppressing bandits has now become as necessary as fire prevention and theft prevention in our daily lives."

Not long ago, in the Battle of Xumatou, the National Army, with less than a regiment, completely annihilated the Huaihai Military District Guard Regiment, said to be the most elite unit of the bandit army in northern Jiangsu, numbering over a thousand men. They also killed one regimental commander, one political commissar, two battalion commanders, and one commissioner (Wu Jue, the puppet Sixth District Commissioner), and two county magistrates (Chen Naitong, the puppet Huaiyin County Magistrate, and Chen Yachang, the Lianshui County Magistrate). Li Yimang, Chairman of the puppet border region government, luckily swam away. This battle is considered a tough one among the pacification campaigns in northern Jiangsu. The reporter arrived in Lianshui, which had been recovered for almost a year. Tiles and bricks littered the ground.

Surrounded on All Sides

Lianshui is still shrouded in an atmosphere of tension and desolation.

Looking at Lianshui County as a whole, Lianshui City is located in the southwest corner, more than two hundred li from the coast in the northeast. In fact, Lianshui City is really too desolate. The market is not as good as a small town in Jiangnan, and the population is only over six thousand people, including two thousand refugees from the countryside. It takes five days to see newspapers from Nanjing and Shanghai, and the total sales of all newspapers are only forty-two copies, with our newspaper having the most, but only ten copies were sold. Here, it must be added: among the forty-two newspapers, only two subscribers are shops, and the rest are for government agencies to read.

Generally speaking, prices are cheap. Fish only sells for three thousand yuan per catty, but few people can afford it.

The terrain of Lianshui is too good, easy to defend and difficult to attack. Now, the city defenses of Lianshui are unnecessary.

The Lian-Huai Highway

is both flat and stable, because this highway is tightly夹住by the ancient Yellow River and the Grand Canal, forming two natural defensive lines. Therefore, although bandits across the two rivers often roam, they ultimately dare not cross the river.

The ancient pagoda west of Lianshui City is said to be near Nengren Temple. This pagoda is named Miaotong Pagoda. A year ago, the entire 74th Division launched

the Battle of Lianshui

and paid a great price near this pagoda, because the pagoda was very tall, and the bandits mounted two heavy machine guns on it, with fierce firepower, making it very difficult to break through. This pagoda has been heavily shelled by our army. It is riddled with holes, and its body is injured. The reporter and Staff Officer Gao Yushan climbed to the top of the pagoda on foot, looking out endlessly. North and south of the pagoda, the waves were surging. Near the pagoda, crops covered the ground, and the autumn wind was strong, with heavy rain threatening. Accumulation like…, I gazed at the cemetery of the fallen soldiers of the 74th Division behind the pagoda, which contained more than seven hundred martyrs who sacrificed their lives for the country and the people, and could not help but smell the desolate and tragic atmosphere.

### Chairman of the Sui Province Assembly Discusses Border Affairs with Peng Xuepei, Urgently Hoping the Central Government Pays Attention to the Northern Defense Line

[Report from Guihua by our correspondent on the 4th] Peng Xuepei, Sun Yueqi, and their party arrived in Sui on the 3rd. Chairman Dong, Zhang Changqin, and Rong Xiangyu, the Comfort Envoy, all went to the station to welcome them. After Peng and others got off the train, they immediately held talks with the leaders at Director Fu's residence. Zhang Qin, Chairman of the Sui Province Assembly, presented three matters to Peng:

The people of Sui Province endured suffering for the country during the War of Resistance and the suppression of bandits, bearing extremely heavy burdens. To date, they have received less than two billion yuan in relief, but the burden of the people in just one item, ten thousand pairs of heavy shoes, is already over three billion yuan.

The disaster situation in Yimeng

is beyond description as "severe." Hundreds of thousands of people fear they will all die of freezing and starvation this winter. They hope the central government will provide substantial relief. The people of Suiyuan understand the issue of Mongolian banner autonomy most deeply. The Mongolian and Han people of Sui Province have lived together in harmony for nearly three hundred years. The Japanese invaders instigated the autonomy of De Wang's Bailing Temple. Now, the vast majority of Han people in Suiyuan sincerely support

Mongolian banner autonomy,

but only with the banner as the autonomous unit, under the jurisdiction of the province. Otherwise, the league is equal to a special banner of the province and is also directly under the central government. Then the same province will be divided into four and five, and the consequences are unimaginable. Suiyuan is the foremost line of national defense. The strength of one province cannot achieve national defense construction. They urgently hope that the central government will pay attention to this northern defense line. The people of Suiyuan today can barely defend themselves, because the people's organization and training have been quite successful under the leadership of Director Chuan and Chairman Dong in recent years. At present, in order to maintain

Security in the Sui Region,

the self-defense forces in various places cannot be ignored, but the people are extremely lacking in self-defense firearms. They hope the central government will allocate firearms, or the people can purchase them themselves. Peng greatly appreciated the various items presented by Zhang and promised to convey them to the central authorities.

### Qingdao China Textile Factory No. 6 Repair Project Nearing Completion

[Report from Qingdao by our correspondent on the 4th] The dispute over the repair of the boiler at the Qingdao Branch of the China Textile Corporation has been reported in detail in previous newspapers. Now, the person in charge of the branch told the reporter: The No. 6 Textile Factory under the branch originally had a 30-ton C.T.M. boiler. When the Japanese managed it, gas was used as fuel. Once, due to a burst in the boiler tube, the gas could not be shut off in time, causing the "dry boiler" to burn. All the boiler tubes were bent due to overheating, and the damage was extremely serious. After the takeover, the factory began to repair it. At that time, only a portion of the boiler tubes were replaced for makeshift use, which always affected production. The engineers of the factory's mobile department believed that only cutting off more than ten boiler tubes above the water pipe and replacing them with new tubes was a temporary relief measure. In order to achieve a permanent solution, a thorough overhaul had to be carried out to replace all the boiler tubes. After construction started, everything went smoothly within two months. Unexpectedly, in August, the factory workers and engineers had a disagreement, involving the method of boiler repair. To ease the situation, the branch authorities transferred the original technician Chen Laisheng (Technician Chen had been transferred to the Qingdao Power Plant to participate in turbine repair work) back to the factory to work in the middle. The method was still carried out according to the original overhaul plan. It is now known that this overhaul project will be successfully completed around the Double Tenth Festival.

### Sichuan Anti-Smoking Supervisory Office Asks for Heavy Troops to Eradicate Drugs

[Report from Chengdu by our correspondent on the 2nd] The smoking and drug problem in Sichuan Province has not been eradicated, especially in eastern Sichuan. The Sichuan Anti-Smoking Supervisory Office has requested the Chongqing Provisional Headquarters to appoint personnel to lead heavy troops to patrol and eradicate. In addition, all counties and cities in Sichuan have begun to universally register smokers. According to a reliable investigation, the total number of smokers in the province is about 1.2 million. The reporter also learned from the person in charge of anti-smoking: The reasons for the difficulty in eradicating smoking and drugs in Sichuan are: The Yi affairs problem has not been thoroughly resolved, and the situation in the border areas is complicated. Corrupt and sheltering law enforcement officials, and the large number of drug offenders being powerful local figures make progress difficult. For example, the recent dismissal of the Pingshan County Magistrate for offending a wealthy family in anti-smoking eradication is one example. Financial difficulties, and a lack of anti-smoking funds make planning mostly empty talk. The central government has now decided to designate the next fiscal year as a period of general inspection, and executive personnel at all levels will be required to issue certifications, but whether the anti-smoking policy in Sichuan can be completed as scheduled depends on the efforts of the executive personnel.

### Wild Boars in Groups Eat Rice at Night, About 200 Acres of Farmland Damaged

[Report from Jinshan source by our correspondent on the 2nd] In the northern and southern townships of this county, hundreds of wild boars have recently been found, eating crops in groups. The damage is no less than a locust plague. Especially in the northern part of the county, from the Kaoshui and Yao Village sections to the Fo'erling, Gaocang, and Xinyuan areas, the damage is the most severe. About 200 acres of land have been damaged, with losses of no less than 50 million yuan. Although farmers in the village go out to jointly resist, because the area where the pigs hide is vast in the mountains, mostly forests, they come every time when the stars and moon are bright. Each time, dozens of pigs gather, led by the largest one in front, and the rest follow behind. People drive them away, but they do not disperse. If they are shot with guns, they are afraid of encountering angry wild boars. They want to prevent them, but sigh that they are overwhelmed.

According to an old farmer surnamed Hu who spoke to the reporter: The wild boar's greatest enemy is the jackal. Jackals like to eat pigs. The method of eating is to gather a large number of jackals. When they see a wild boar, the jackals urinate, sprinkling it on the trees and leaves. When the pig touches the urine, it immediately becomes blind. The pack of jackals chase the pig to a flat open area, where they insert their front feet into the pig's anus and into its abdomen, digging out its liver and intestines and hanging them on the roots of trees. The pig runs madly in pain. Soon, the intestines and blood are exhausted, and it dies. The pack of jackals gather and eat it. Therefore, wild boars know when jackals are coming and rush to go far away. In ancient times, wild boars harming crops meant that the year would be fierce and rice prices would be high. After the pigs eat the crops, the jackals must chase them, removing the harm for the people. Previous evidence can be relied upon and is invariably accurate. The farmer's words are as follows, so I will record them together. (Special correspondent Yu Ningpo)

### Fujian Education Director Uncovers Fraud, Zhu Zhen Impersonates to Seek Employment, Sent to Security Department for Investigation

[Report from Fuzhou by our correspondent on the 4th] A fraud to seek employment has occurred here. A person named Zhu Zhen claimed to be Zhu Jiahua's nephew, forged Zhu's letter, and instructed that he be seen by the Fujian Education Director Liang Longguang to seek employment.

The Education Department then sent personnel to his hotel and found a public letter forged with the seal of the 63rd Army. He was immediately sent to the Security Department for interrogation. According to his confession: he had served as a lieutenant colonel deputy regiment commander and other positions.

### Qiongya Party and Group Meeting to Prepare for the Establishment of a Construction Research Association

[Aeronautical Report from Hainan Island by our correspondent on the 1st] The Qiongya Party and State authorities held a joint Party and State meeting at the Commissioner's Office on the 27th of last month. Those present included many cadres, executive members, and supervisors of the Qiongya Regional Headquarters of the Youth League and the Qiongshan County Party Headquarters.

To establish a Hainan Island Construction Research Association. To expand the organization of the Qiongya Bandit Suppression and Village Protection Association Headquarters and strengthen the work of suppressing bandits and protecting villages. (Another dispatch) At about 8:00 PM on September 24, the Sixth Detachment of communist bandits led by Fu Zhi, and the police team of the Democratic Government of Lingao County, with about 300 bandit soldiers, equipped with nine light machine guns and two grenade launchers, suddenly attacked Jialai City, which belongs to Lingao County. At that time, the only troops stationed in the city were more than ten self-defense team members from the township office and a detachment of the county assembly team. Although outnumbered, they calmly defended the stronghold to the death, displaying their power and counterattacking the bandits. The two sides fought fiercely for seven hours. In this battle, one bandit detachment leader and more than twenty bandits were killed. Our squad leader Hong Wendou suffered a severe leg injury. During the battle, because the city area was vast, our troops could not be deployed in small numbers, resulting in many shops being robbed, with losses of about 200 million yuan. Two citizens were killed, and twelve gentlemen, including Fu Qirong, were taken away by the bandits due to lack of preparedness. Also on the 24th, the Chen Wuying detachment of bandits, numbering about 300, was completely surrounded. On the 25th, we completely occupied the area, and the bandits fled in a panic. It is reported that about 200 bandits were killed or wounded in this battle.

### Fujian Province Middle School Student Vocational Interest Test

[Report from Fuzhou by our correspondent on the 2nd] The Fujian Provincial Department of Education recently conducted a survey of middle school students' vocational interests. According to the statistics, among junior high school students, the desire to engage in business accounted for 18% of the total, ranking first. High school students mostly aspire to practice medicine, accounting for 13.9% of the total, ranking second, followed by teachers and businessmen, each accounting for 8%. Female students generally like to be teachers, accounting for 24% of the total, which may be a manifestation of women's natural love of "education." As for cultural undertakings, journalism, and lawyers, they are not among the areas of interest of young students. It is noteworthy that administrative officials and tax officials, who were once considered good positions, are also not of interest to young students. The Provincial Department of Education is now conducting close research based on the materials in order to provide guidance and correction in response to the real psychology of young people.

### Talking About National Tung Chi University in Autumn: Our Reporter Zhao Zhan

Looking at the verdant Northern Mausoleum cypresses and pines, and the leisurely white clouds above the Hanqing Building, I think of Northeast University (東大) as a forlorn youth, silently pondering in the boundless autumn scenery.

After my visit to National Tung Chi University (車大), Acting President Liu Shuxun Guang Sheng told me: "Every difficulty other schools have, National Tung Chi University (東大) has as well. The problems National Tung Chi University (東大) faces are problems that all universities across the country face. However, National Tung Chi University (東大) alone faces difficulties that other schools do not have.”

He gave an example: The problem of winter coal is not so serious in Shanghai (　　). The winter coal fund requires 500 million in circulating vouchers. This is a huge sum. According to him, when Minister Zhu came to Shenyang, he promised to find a solution, but the funds have not yet been allocated. Looking at the sparse buildings of National Tung Chi University (東大), without coal, it is impossible to live through the winter.

Minister Zhu's conclusion after inspecting the Northeast: He said that National Tung Chi University (東大) was in the worst state of recovery. The students and faculty of National Tung Chi University (東大) were very unhappy to hear this. They were full of complaints, saying that the worst was a certain Receiving Commissioner Wang, not the entire university. Wang was responsible for the school's building repair work, colluding with contractors to commit fraud, making a fortune, and now living leisurely in Beiping. Mr. Zang Qifang should of course be held responsible. This matter directly caused the student unrest this spring. Terrorists took the opportunity to act, and a hand grenade was thrown on the concrete floor of the Hanqing Building. A dozen students were thrown into the black prison. I went to see the site of the explosion. The mark of the grenade looked just like a student had accidentally dropped an ink bottle, but the color had faded. The original building could be said to be extremely solid. The repairs are not uniform, the roof leaks, and the doors and floors are also damaged. It's a pity. What is being "repaired"?

On the surface, National Tung Chi University (東大) looks like a desolate garden, overgrown with weeds and brambles. Minister Zhu's impression may have been affected by the chaotic exterior. Moreover, because the students were surrounded by too many difficulties, the students in turn surrounded Minister Zhu. Although Minister Zhu's generous promises relieved himself of the situation (　), the students were still surrounded by difficulties. Minister Zhu left, leaving the students with the temptation of hope.

National Tung Chi University (東大) has five colleges with more than 2,800 students, more than 500 new students this autumn, and more than 200 graduates this summer. Among the five colleges, the College of Law and Commerce stands out, with nearly a thousand students. The College of Engineering has the fewest students, with only over 200. According to people in the school, because the science and engineering courses in the puppet Manchukuo were shallow and only focused on providing technical training, high school students entering the university find the courses in the College of Engineering difficult to keep up with, and they are all considered daunting. Most of the graduating students this year have already found employment. The graduates of the College of Engineering have better prospects. The Northeast needs talent everywhere. The employment rate of university graduates in Guan Nei (關內) is only about 50%!

Students have difficulties, and professors also have difficulties. A series of problems and misunderstandings are intertwined. The Northeast is a war zone, and prices are higher than in Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, and Hebei, while the salaries of national university faculty are uniform. So who would want to come to the Northeast to teach? Because of the issue of hiring professors, students misunderstood Acting President Liu. Before Minister Zhu, they said that National Tung Chi University (東大) was not a College of Engineering, and they demanded that first-class educators preside over National Tung Chi University (東大). Acting President Liu was originally the dean of the College of Engineering, and it was naturally easier for him to hire professors from the College of Engineering than to hire professors from the College of Agriculture.

Professors are troubled by the uneven levels of students, making it difficult to find a consistent standard. The general English and Chinese proficiency of students is low. English has to be taught in two groups, A and B. Group B teaches high school courses, and other courses also use Chinese translations as much as possible.

Students eat two kinds of meals. Publicly funded students who have returned from the interior eat rice, four dishes and one soup. Many students who have enrolled in the Northeast are students who have fled from bandit areas and have no assistance. Publicly funded students are willing to share the hardship with self-funded students, eating sorghum rice and one vegetable dish. Such a difference creates an invisible psychological boundary.

Two thousand male and female youth refugee students from Andong are living in a corner of National Tung Chi University (東大). They have no schools or books. For two months, they have been wandering on the grass or dozing on the floor, impatiently whistling or pondering. In the summer, they fled in thin clothing, and winter is coming. Their appeals have nowhere to go, and tears cannot keep them warm. I asked a little girl if she missed her home. She ran away with red eyes. The students of National Tung Chi University (東大) are considered lucky compared to these refugee children.

### After President Zhang's Meeting with the Governor of Hong Kong, Financial Agreement Will Be Gradually Implemented

[Our Report] President Zhang of the Central Bank returned to Shanghai from Beijing on the evening of the 3rd. Yesterday, he told reporters that he had met with Hong Kong Governor Grantham and his financial advisors several times in Beijing to discuss matters related to the financial agreement and customs agreement, and the results were very satisfactory. After the financial agreement was signed in mid-August, the reason for its failure to implement was the British announcement that the pound could not be freely exchanged for US dollars. At the same time, the Chinese side's announcement of new foreign exchange measures had an impact on the US dollar portion of the agreement. Therefore, the Hong Kong government hoped to postpone the implementation date of the agreement. However, as a result of the discussions in Beijing, it was decided to continue to study the US dollar portion, while implementing the other portions as soon as possible. The Governor of Hong Kong has decided to start preparing detailed implementation rules upon his return to Hong Kong. It is expected to be announced and implemented within two weeks. Regarding the customs agreement, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has consulted with the British Embassy and reached an agreement. The original plan was to sign the agreement after the British government had approved the text. During this trip to Beijing, the British Ambassador informed me that the British government had revised and approved the text of the agreement and sent it out, and it was already on its way. As soon as it arrives, it can be signed. The Chinese government attaches great importance to anti-smuggling. If the customs agreement is signed soon, it will greatly help with anti-smuggling work.

### Import Without Permits: Foreign Exchange Handling Issues, Opinions Provided by the Chamber of Commerce

Regarding the handling of foreign goods imported without permits, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce of this city specially telegraphed to the Nanjing National Government, Political Affairs Committee, Executive Yuan, and National Economic Council yesterday, stating: The issue of handling foreign goods imported without permits is reportedly going to be decided by the Political Affairs Conference. It is our humble opinion that although those who import goods with their own foreign exchange have their own unavoidable circumstances, the procedures are indeed lacking. It seems fair to impose a slight customs duty as a form of sanction. However, requiring a deposit of 50% is too heavy a burden, exceeding the ability of businesses to bear. If this is passed on to commodity prices, it is feared it will further affect people's livelihoods. Furthermore, investigating the source of foreign exchange after the fact, when the funds have already become goods, is of no help and only creates malpractices. It seems more appropriate to require importers to provide a written guarantee ensuring future compliance. We respectfully request your adoption and implementation.

### Limited祁门 Black Tea Exports

祁门 black tea, which was previously exported to Europe, is not being purchased by the UK due to high prices. Currently, Switzerland and other places still favor this variety, but they are offering lower prices, resulting in sporadic sales. Wang Yi Yutai, Wuchang, Xinhua, and other tea companies have recently inquired about this year's Luzhuang Wuyuan bulk tea, but transactions remain low due to the owners' insistence on price. However, the base price is firmer than before. Internal sales of red and green tea remain continuous and active as before.

### Profile of Ho Chi Minh

— Qiao

Rumors have recently circulated about the arrest and death of Ho Chi Minh, who claims to be the President of Vietnam, but these have not been confirmed. Here is a brief introduction to Ho Chi Minh's life, which should be of interest to readers regarding this momentous figure:

He was born in 1890 in Yi Jing, Vietnam. At the age of seven or eight, he often helped his father deliver secret letters, connecting with revolutionaries in the vicinity. In his youth, he witnessed the anti-French uprisings led by Huang Hua Tan in 1907-08, the poisoning case at the Tokyo French Barracks in 1909, the "March 23" embankment bombing case in 1912, the "April 23" Nguyen Cam Giang's assassination of the Vietnamese Governor-General Sarraut, and Nguyen Van To's Hanoi uprising in 1914, and Zhang Er's uprising. He participated in secret revolutionary movements. Due to intense pursuit by the French, he disguised himself and served on ships, traveling to France, Germany, Italy, England, the United States, and Japan. He joined the Communist Party in France and later studied in the Soviet Union. Later, he came to China during the Northern Expedition period. Before the purge, he served as the secretary of Borodin. In 1927, he organized the Marxist Vietnamese Overseas Group in Hong Kong, then the Vietnamese Communist Youth League, and eventually founded the Vietnamese Communist Party. After the Pacific War, he could not gain a foothold in Vietnam and went to various provinces in southern China to collude with the Chinese Communists and undermine China's war efforts. He was arrested by the Guangxi authorities in Liuzhou but was soon released on bail. In the spring of 1945, he returned to Vietnam and launched a guerrilla war against Japan. On September 2 of the same year, he declared the establishment of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and a provisional government. King Bao Dai of Annam was forced to abdicate and fled to Hong Kong. In March 1946, he reorganized the provisional government into a coalition government. On October 26 of the same year, he convened the so-called Second People's Assembly, passed the Constitution of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and appointed himself as the President. On November 3, he reorganized the government and appointed himself as the Chairman and Minister of Foreign Affairs.

Two piles of apples were on the ground, one of solid and large apples, the other of green and small apples. "Should the large ones be placed on top and the small ones on the bottom?" The new helper asked the owner while packing the apples into the barrel.

"Of course not," the owner replied. "Honesty is the best policy. Put the small ones on top and the large ones on the bottom!"

The helper obeyed the owner's instructions while secretly laughing at the owner's foolishness.

"Is the barrel full?" the owner asked.

"It's full," the helper replied. "And the barrel lid has been nailed on."

"Good," the owner said. "Now turn the barrel upside down and put on the label!"

In a zoology class, the teacher asked the students, "Children, do you know what humans have that other animals don't?"

After a long pause, a clear, small voice of a girl broke the silence: "It's probably sexual harassment!"

Katie was a brick carrier in the construction project, but he worked very lazily.

"Katie, you lazy bum who only knows how to eat," the supervisor, Merlin, roared, "You should carry twelve bricks at a time, understand? That's a dozen at a time!"

So Katie followed the supervisor's instructions and carried twelve bricks each time, but about twenty minutes later, there were only eleven bricks left. He looked up at the supervisor high above and said, "Hey! Merlin, can you hear me?"

"Yes, what's the matter?"

"Sorry, Mr. Merlin," Katie said politely, "Right now, I'm one brick short. I don't dare to move according to your words. Or, please throw one to me!" (Translated from Crown Magazine, September issue)

### Sexual Activities in the Soviet Union

— Chai Fei

Those who have traveled to Moscow often find the Soviet Union's handling of general love affairs a bit shameful and avoid talking about them. Lovers in movies are not allowed to kiss affectionately. Even nude plaster statues must be covered with fabric. The gap between men and women in the currently popular social dances is enough to accommodate a third person. If we think that the veil of immorality hides too much of the Soviet regime, then all these measures are not surprising. Later, in order to stabilize family life, there were indeed some changes in the relationship between the sexes. In 1915, three years before the Bolsheviks marched into Moscow, Lenin and his close friend, Inessa Armand, collaborated to clarify the prevalent superficial concepts of free love through spiritual warfare. There should be no problem in liberating the prejudices of money, religion, and class, because the creators of the new regime will certainly praise all kinds of freedom. However, sexual relations that are only superficial should obviously not be supported. Lenin was not interested in mere love and empty friendship. He believed that family responsibilities and obligations must be determined. He felt that traditional habits also had their merits regarding procreation.

However, the Soviet Union obviously did not follow these instructions later. When I was fifteen years old, a wedding I saw in Moscow was as simple as just registering, taking only three minutes. There were no witnesses, no speeches, and no recitation of legal provisions.

Divorce was even faster than marriage. Just a card stating the wishes of both parties was enough. In the early years of the revolution, abortion was completely legal. The law allowed everyone to freely unite and, conversely, allowed everyone to destroy the new life they conceived.

Many years after the revolution, this situation completely changed. Although the handling of marriage still followed the new traditions after the revolution, it was relatively much more solemn. The halls were usually decorated with lights and ribbons, pastors warmly blessed the happiness of the newlyweds, and speeches were also included in the wedding ceremony. In some cases, the newlyweds also wore white dresses. After the ceremony, guests were usually treated with "vodka."

Divorce also became more difficult. A very serious reason was required for approval. When divorcing by agreement, the date of execution was deliberately extended to give both parties time to reflect. To some extent, making the divorce known to the public was clearly very beneficial for both parties to remarry. Those who proposed a divorce had to spend 500 to 2,000 rubles to obtain the other party's permission. Abortion was considered illegal unless a doctor believed that the fetus would endanger the mother's life.

In recent years, the Soviet Union has been vigorously promoting childbirth and is deeply proud of it. The regime believes that this measure is nothing less than consolidating the foundation of its Soviet organization. A mother who has given birth to ten children is awarded the honorary title of "Heroine Mother," and those who have raised seven, eight, or nine children can also receive the "Medal of Maternal Glory."

### Ginkgo Tree

— Zhu Zhenjiang

Recently, the Chinese Consul in Los Angeles presented a ginkgo tree, airfreighted from China to the United States, to the University of Southern California in Los Angeles to enhance friendship and to express gratitude for the university's establishment of a Chinese Literature Award.

The ginkgo tree is a very common tree in China, but why is it so valued internationally? Let me explain this slowly. The ginkgo tree is a gymnosperm. Although it grew everywhere in the Jurassic period, it is now only found in China. Its scientific name is Ginkyo biloba, which comes from the Japanization of the Chinese word. The original Chinese name is "Duck Foot Tree" because its leaves resemble duck feet. It is also called "Grandson Tree" because the grandfather plants it and the grandson harvests its fruit. The literati of the Song Dynasty were extremely fond of chanting about ginkgo, so the ginkgo tree was valued by the world.

Japan has ginkgo trees because they were moved from China. Therefore, it is called a tree from a different dynasty in the dictionary, or it is said to be a transliteration of "duck foot." Japan probably had the name ginkgo in the Song Dynasty, or perhaps earlier.

It went to Europe and America in 1730 to the Netherlands, 1754 to England, and 1768 to Austria. Ginkgo trees were first seen in the United States in 1795. The German poet Goethe's poem about ginkgo leaves was written in 1815.

From September 8 to 15, 1815, Goethe was in Frauenfeld and gave a ginkgo leaf to Mariane, saying:

"Who knows that originally it was one thing, which divided into two, and united into one?"

This is Goethe's expression of his feelings after meeting Mrs. Mariane, using a ginkgo leaf to express his longing after parting. I remember Tang Ziyou's poem about red leaves: "I once heard that complaints are written on red leaves, who are the letters on the leaves sent to?" So China has a story of expressing intentions with leaves since ancient times. Today, there is still a ginkgo tree standing in the Holzhausen Park in Frankfurt, and there is also a ginkgo tree planted by Goethe's hand in Jena, Germany. It is said that this tree has both male and female characteristics and was used by Goethe as material for studying teratology.

In short, Goethe and ginkgo had an inextricable bond. There is a monument to Goethe in Heidelberg, as well as a commemorative chair. A ginkgo leaf is carved on the chair, and a ginkgo tree is planted next to the chair. The poet is ten times more valued because of the ginkgo, and the poet's feelings are conveyed because of the ginkgo. The fact that a famous Western poet became friends with a famous Eastern tree is truly a good match, which cannot be understood by ordinary people.

Therefore, today, when China presents a ginkgo tree to the University of Los Angeles in the United States, it is not just to express gratitude!

### Miss America

Miss America's Hero Worship

Americans are a nation with a sense of hero worship. They worship all kinds of strange and bizarre people. The heroes we recognize are mostly figures of military prowess, such as Guan Yu, Yue Fei, Zhuge Liang, and Ming Taizu. The heroes in their minds include all kinds of people, down to vaudeville kings, dance experts, golf experts, wrestlers, and strongmen. Only outstanding people can be welcomed by the public in American society. Mediocre people without special skills cannot easily gain social favor. American society is communal, not solitary. A person who is not welcomed by society cannot live alone in America. Therefore, people who go to America from overseas must have at least one skill, especially in front of multi-talented American women. If you don't have a talent that surpasses hers, you can never win her favor. Your skills are not limited to academic aspects. If you have outstanding achievements in academics, such as writing many books, having scientific inventions, having a talent for rhetoric, or being good at diplomatic language, you can win the favor of Miss America. In addition, if you dance the best, or have a large alcohol capacity, or can tell jokes, or have a very thick face and are not afraid of embarrassment, or are good at manipulating women, they are all heroes worthy of worship in the eyes of Miss America. If you have made special contributions in the War of Resistance, killed several Japanese soldiers, raised a national flag in the occupied area, or forced a landing in the wilderness, then you are a complete, authentic, and unadulterated hero. Not only will many ladies on the street come up to shake hands and say hello, but even kiss you wildly to show admiration, even stepping through the threshold of your house. There will also be a large number of woolen clothes, handkerchiefs, pajamas, and pillowcases sent by unfamiliar ladies, making you flattered and at a loss. There are also ladies who have never met who propose marriage in the first letter. Miss America is so straightforward and innocent. It seems that once she finds her ideal person, she can't wait even one more day and must live together immediately. Going from worshiping a hero to possessing a hero is completely opposite to the reticence and timidity of Chinese ladies. If Miss America worships a hero, she will never consider the hero's background, or even investigate the hero's economic situation. As long as she can achieve the goal of possession, she will wholeheartedly worship everything without question. Heroes have no place to use their talents in China. A hero without an economic background will never receive the worship of Chinese women. Many heroes who have been disarmed beg on the streets, and modern ladies walk by without even lifting an eyelid. If these heroes went to America, they would have been embraced into the boudoir by the ladies, worshiped and worshiped. Therefore, in China, there are only street heroes. When heroes get to the streets, it is like a tiger falling into the plains, treated as a castrated cat.

Two Worthy British Films

This past week, the two British films "Great Expectations" and "Odd Man Out" are worthy of recommending to audiences who love cinematic art. British films have their unique style. When we are tired of the superficial American films, British films bring you a fresh style. Undoubtedly, their use of realism is correct. We have deeply felt this from past works such as "Brief Encounter" and "This Happy Breed". Similarly, "Great Expectations" has made even more progress.

"Great Expectations" is a famous work by Dickens. Now, David Lean, the leading director in the British film industry, is in charge of directing and adapting it. He handled this famous work precisely and concisely. Especially the harvest of the first half of the play has immortal achievements.

Among the actors, I especially praise the young actor Anthony Wager who played Pip's childhood. He has already created outstanding achievements. John Mills's Pip, Valerie Hobson's Estella, and Finlay Currie's escaped convict Magwitch also have excellent performances. The photography of this film is also worthy of mention.

Another "Odd Man Out" is slightly inferior to "Great Expectations", but it is still an excellent literary film.

"Bathing Beauty" an Entertainment Film

After "Bathing Beauty" was a great hit, this "Easy to Wed" will definitely be liked by the audience as well. Although the script of this play cannot escape the love story, it is not written in a vulgar way. As an entertainment film, then, this play is worth watching.

The female lead, Esther Williams, is a beautiful star on the screen. She is good at swimming, so this play inevitably includes swimming scenes, but there are no brilliant performances. Moreover, she can't act, and she can't handle several scenes that require deeper performances. The male lead Van Johnson's performance is also very mediocre. On the other hand, Laurez Melchior's performance as a male singer is not bad, and there are also several supporting roles that are better than the leading actors.

Detective Film "The Third Day"

This film depicts those special people in American society and can also be regarded as another way of writing detective films. The story still cannot escape the circle of murder and love. So the theme is not new. Although it seems technically stable, the director's mediocre technique is also the fatal flaw of this play.

Dick Powell's performance is still strong.

Not a Wonderful "The Return of Monte Cristo"

A film making a sequel is always worse than the previous one. Because "The Count of Monte Cristo" was once a sensation, this "The Return of Monte Cristo" was produced, that is, the sequel. But the achievement is too far away. Moreover, the audience is already feeling tired of this type of film.

### Wonderful Way to Resolve Hatred

— Zhi Fei, translator

If "quarreling" requires at least two people, then how many people are needed for "reconciliation"? — This is not a riddle game, but a very important question. If it can be answered appropriately, it can avoid many tragedies in the world.

"Quarrels" are very easy to cause: a hasty word, an accidental action — it comes immediately. Then "self-esteem" joins in, and the real trouble begins. It's not really harmful to have a good, hearty quarrel. It can often be quite beneficial to say what you think in your heart directly. If you have a grudge against someone, it is much better to say it directly than to brew it in your heart and let it worsen your relationship.

The dangerous and harmful thing is the aftermath of the quarrel. That kind of harsh hatred and anger, that kind of intractable determination, can make the person's life so unbearable. So let us answer this question directly and straightforwardly — "reconciliation" only requires one person. If you think that the other party should always make a move first, please think about it calmly again!

Why shouldn't you make a move first? Who exactly are you that you must regard your emotions and self-esteem so important? — Even if the other party doesn't make a move first, it is also foolish.

"Self-esteem" is mostly vanity — based on the false notion of "thinking you're great." So, the next time you are saddened by the aftermath of a quarrel, you should take the trouble to make a move first to end that unpleasant, aggravating situation. Then you will be surprised to find that the other party is willing to run half the way to meet you. Originally, he, like you, had been thinking about how to make a move to reconcile with you as before — or even understand each other better than before!
