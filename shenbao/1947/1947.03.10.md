### Taipei and Keelung Riots Unabated, Government Agencies Attacked by Rioters; Central Government to Send Minister Bai for Condolences

[Central News Agency, Taipei, 9th] The superficial calm of the past five days has been shattered by the continuous gunfire of last night. Young rioters from Taiwan attacked the Keelung Fortress Command at 2 PM yesterday, resulting in two deaths. Keelung was immediately placed under martial law, and rioters in Taipei also launched attacks in groups. At 10:30 PM last night, the Yuanshan Naval Office was the first to be attacked. Other rioters attacked the Supply Bureau, warehouses, the Garrison Headquarters, the Army Hospital, and government offices. The sound of rifles, machine guns, and grenades filled the air for about an hour. Yang Liangong, the Supervisory Commissioner of Fujian and Taiwan, arrived at Keelung Port yesterday afternoon on the Hai Ping ship, having departed from Fujian. He was only able to disembark at 10 PM. Accompanying him were two battalions of military police. Yang and his staff member Liu Qikun also traveled on a truck carrying the military police, departing from Keelung at 2 AM this morning. En route, they were intercepted by rioters, and gunfire was exchanged. One military policeman was injured, and Liu Qikun's finger was severed. Yang was fortunate to have moved his seat earlier, avoiding injury, but he was still shaken and even fell out of the vehicle. They finally arrived in Taipei at 3 AM. According to Yang, "The rioters are carrying rifles, grenades, and small cannons." Gunfire continued unabated throughout the night in Taipei, and the number of casualties is unknown. The entire city has been placed under martial law since 6 AM, with the military and police deployed to posts, prohibiting rioters from moving in groups. Gunfire is still frequent. It is reported that Commander Chen is still determined to fulfill all the promises he made, but is determined to stop the illegal behavior of the rioters. The 32 demands made yesterday by the "February 28th Incident Handling Committee" clearly aim to resist the central government, and Commander Chen expressed great anger after learning of this.

[Central News Agency, Taipei, 8th] Members of the "Loyalty and Righteousness Service Corps" and young students, who are responsible for maintaining public order among the civilians here, have been searching the residences of mainlanders here day and night for the past three days. They claim to be searching for civilian firearms, but documents are also being inspected, and money, watches, clothing, and items are openly looted. They conduct searches street by street, and some residences have even been looted more than four times. In addition to looting, they also create acts of terror. A Taiwanese person threw a grenade into Ge Jing'en's residence, and when Mrs. Ge smelled the sulfur, a mainlander servant had already been slightly injured. Mr. and Mrs. Ge have moved into the public residence tonight. Commander Chen has been residing and holding office in the public office since "February 28th." All department heads also reside in the office. Commander Chen's brother, Chen Gongquan's residence, was also searched today. Our office had three bicycles and eight sets of clothes stolen last night. Four telephones are still out of service this afternoon, making communication impossible. These illegal acts of disturbance day and night have made it difficult for mainlanders here to live and eat in peace. They are now eager to leave. In the past two days, several thousand mainlanders have registered for ship tickets at the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. A staff member of a certain province at the Compilation and Translation Office suddenly suffered a nervous breakdown today. The stimulation they have received can be imagined. Zhou Yiying, the Director of Civil Affairs of the Public Office, went to the "February 28th Incident Handling Committee" this afternoon to negotiate, demanding that the committee stop the search of residences.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 9th] It is heard that the central government will send Minister Bai Chongxi to Taiwan for condolences.

### Communist Troops in Western Shanxi Cross the Yellow River; Being Transferred to Yan'an and Concentrated in the Southeast

[Our Newspaper, Xi'an, 9th] Communist troops in western Shanxi are constantly being transferred back to Yan'an for concentration. After the 235th Brigade was transferred west, the 358th Brigade also secretly crossed the Yellow River, joining the ranks south and southeast of Yan'an. The original 1st and 2nd Training Brigades defending this area have been combined into a Training Brigade, all of which are central troops of the CCP. Its brigade headquarters and the 3rd Regiment are still defending Jinpenwan, 15 kilometers southeast of Yan'an. All military institutions in Yan'an are concentrated in this area, making it an important stronghold. The 2nd Regiment is stationed in Linfen in the middle reaches of the Fen River, where heavy troops are also gathered. The 1st Regiment is stationed in Kuangxian, the first gateway on the highway from Guanzhong into the Yan'an area. Also, the pocket-shaped positions in Yijun and Malan were quickly resolved this time. Hu Jingduo, the commander of the communist troops in the area, was dismissed and transferred. Yang Jimin, the son of Yang Hucheng, succeeded him, with his command post set up in Shuijiaping. Small groups still appear in this mountainous area from time to time.

### Mao Zedong's Whereabouts Are Mysterious

[United Press, Yan'an, 9th] Well-informed sources told the United Press today: CCP leader Mao Zedong's whereabouts are uncertain and rarely seen. His residence is moved almost every week to avoid possible air raids and maintain a quiet environment for his demanding work. Only a few key CCP officials and his bodyguards, who never leave his side, know Mao's exact address.

### Sun Lianzhong Goes to Baoding; No Major Changes in the Personnel of the Pacification Headquarters

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 9th] Sun Lianzhong is scheduled to go to Baoding on the morning of the 10th. He gave a speech to officers and soldiers on the afternoon of the 9th. He told reporters about the current situation in Hebei Province, saying that after the recent cleanup of the northern section of the Pinghan Railway, most of the main force of the communist troops, except for those who were defeated, had fled into the mountains. Although there are still a considerable number of communist troops operating near Xushui and Mancheng, they are not enough to threaten the safety of the transportation line. The national army is not taking any major actions at the moment, but it can control the communist troops' disturbances. There are no large groups of communist troops north of the Yongding River. There has been tension in the northern section of the Jinpu Railway recently. Those who have fled from Shandong Province to the Cangxian area seem to be mostly defeated troops, and the national army has taken strict precautions. There have been no major incidents on both lines of the Beining Railway. The situation is best in Luannan, Changli, and Fengrun counties in eastern Hebei. To make them demonstration counties for the implementation of the New Administration, they are actively training cadres below the township level, a total of nine thousand people. The communist troops currently existing in eastern Hebei are still the approximately 10,000 troops under Li Yunchang, who are entrenched in the mountains of Jixian and Zunhua and cause occasional disturbances.

[Our Newspaper, Baoding, 9th] Sun Lianzhong is scheduled to come to Baoding on the 10th to preside over the opening of the first Provisional Assembly of Hebei Province and the establishment of the Baoding Pacification Headquarters. After the reorganization of the Commander-in-Chief's Office into the Pacification Headquarters, it is scheduled to move from Beiping to Baoding within this month.

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 9th] The 11th War Zone Commander-in-Chief's Office was reorganized into the Baoding Pacification Headquarters on the 1st of this month. The internal personnel arrangements have been announced, with no major changes.

### Alarming Situation in Eastern Jilin

[Central News Agency, Jilin, 8th] The tense situation on the northwest sides of Jilin has eased slightly, but the east side is now alarming. At 6 PM last night, 4,000 well-equipped communist troops from the Jiahe area were suddenly discovered east of Laoye Ridge. At Tiangang, about 25 li southeast of Dongbeicha, about 10,000 communist troops were discovered this morning. Also, a large number of communist troops of unknown numbers have gathered near Huadian and Panshi south of Jilin. The national army is on strict alert.

### Close Relationship Between the CCP and North Korea

[Central News Agency, New York, 8th] The New York Herald Tribune published a dispatch from Seoul by its reporter Steel on the front page today. The headline was "Close Relationship Between the CCP and the Soviet-Occupied Area of North Korea." The article stated that according to some signs, the CCP and the communist authorities in North Korea have a close cooperation agreement. It also stated that according to reliable news obtained from the Soviet-occupied area, North Korea and China have a relationship, and a large number of Korean troops have entered Korean territory from the Northeast for several months, and have now become a powerful force in the North Korean government army supported by the Soviet Union. The number of troops is 50,000, and the troops are mixed with many soldiers who stayed in the Northeast after Japan surrendered. Their leaders are trainees from Yan'an, and some are graduates of CCP military and political schools. Their supreme leader is Kim Mu-jong (transliteration). He is a veteran CCP member and also a Korean national who once lived in Yan'an. He then served as the commander of the Korean Volunteer Army. Now he is the commander of the newly established "Security Army" in North Korea, which is a mere name. This group of soldiers and North Korean police will become the core of the army, because in the Soviet-occupied area of Korea, a large number of people have been conscripted for unknown reasons. "Although the Koreans trained in Yan'an are mainly involved in the military aspects of the North Korean regime, some also hold key political positions." The relationship between the Korean communists trained in China and the more extreme Korean communists trained in the Soviet Union who control the North Korean government is not always good, but most of their major differences in policy and strategy have been resolved. Some people who believe that communism is too extreme for Korea have moved to South Korea under US occupation. They will advocate a more moderate front there. Koreans in the "Communist Democratic Allied Army" in Northeast China began to move into North Korea in early autumn last year and are still continuing. This movement is said to be carried out in accordance with the instructions of Yan'an to the Northeast CCP. It is said that this instruction emphasizes the importance of close cooperation between the Chinese and Korean parties, and this connection may become more important if the Soviet Union withdraws from North Korea. The CCP still controls most of the Sino-Korean border area, so they can easily supply food and military supplies to the Korean communists if necessary. Therefore, if the US and Soviet troops withdraw, this assistance from the CCP can become a decisive factor in the communization of the entire Korea. Unlike the Soviet Union, the CCP is not prohibited or hindered by any international treaties. Moreover, there are many Korean immigrants in the backward villages of Northeast China controlled by the CCP. This is a rich human resource reserve, and the mountainous area bordering Northeast Korea can be used as a good base for training future Korean guerrillas.

### Hu Shi Talks About the Current Situation

[Our Newspaper] Our reporter met Mr. Hu Shi at the International Hotel yesterday. He flew directly to this city from Beiping on the 6th.

The reporter asked Mr. Hu for a historical perspective on national affairs. He initially refused, believing that "history never repeats itself," making it difficult to make comparisons. Later, he said: China, as an unprepared country, has encountered an unprecedented eight-year war in history. The current difficulties are a natural phenomenon. Many diseases are inherited from history, and we cannot escape reality. Although the World War has ended, countries have not yet returned to normal. Not to mention Britain and France, even the United States, which is as rich as it is, has suffered the least direct damage from the war, but travel and housing have still not returned to the pre-war situation.

Hu believes that cooperation between the KMT and the CCP is unlikely. He said: "In the past, I wrote to Mao Zedong, asking the CCP to be the Labor Party of China. It was a gentleman's love for others with virtue. Now I admit that it was too optimistic. It was a historical mistake of Hu Shi." British and American-style political parties are fundamentally different from Soviet-style political parties. The British Labor Party is now the ruling party. If it fails in the general election three years later, it will withdraw from the government without mobilizing military force to maintain its regime. Can the Communist Party do this?

When talking about reorganizing the government, Hu repeatedly said he had no opinions. He said: "The newspapers say that he is going to participate in the government, which is completely unfounded." "The number of true liberals in China is already very small. It is also very necessary to leave these people outside the government to work for the country and for the people. My friends understand this, and the government also understands this. What is rumored outside is completely unfounded."

Regarding the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference, Hu said: Because he is too busy, he has no time to read foreign newspapers and has not yet studied international politics.

(4) At least two-thirds of the heads of provincial departments must be filled by individuals who have resided in the province for more than ten years (preferably the Secretary-General, and the heads of the Civil Affairs, Finance, Industry and Mining, Agriculture and Forestry, Education, and Police departments should be filled in this way).

[This newspaper's report] According to a certain person who recently came from Taiwan: The "February 28th" incident in Taipei, where a local disturbance occurred between a minor riot and military police, sparked unrest in various places and served as the fuse for the general Taiwanese population's misunderstanding that the Taiwan Chief Executive system was the same as the Governor-General system during the Japanese era. The general public was dissatisfied with the Chief Executive system and the monopoly system. Long-standing grievances were escalating daily. In addition, the authorities failed to take effective measures to address last year's food shortage in Taiwan. The public's sense of insecurity reached its peak. Even a minor conflict could easily lead to misunderstandings.

The Handling Committee Regards Itself as the Government

[Central News Agency, Taipei, 9th] The Taiwan Province "February 28th" Incident Handling Committee actually regards itself as the government and will establish a handling bureau to handle the aftermath and a political affairs bureau responsible for planning political reforms. The political affairs bureau will be established before March 15th. The method of its formation is that each township and district will elect one candidate representative, and then the county and city councils will elect from them. The allocation of seats is as follows: Taipei City 2 seats, Taipei County 3 seats, Keelung City 1 seat, Hsinchu City 1 seat, Hsinchu County 3 seats, Taichung City 1 seat, Taichung County 4 seats, Changhua City 1 seat, Chiayi City 1 seat, Tainan City 1 seat, Tainan County 4 seats, Kaohsiung City 1 seat, Kaohsiung County 3 seats, Pingtung City 1 seat, Penghu County 1 seat, Hualien County 1 seat, Taitung County 1 seat, totaling 30 seats.

[Another dispatch] The Taiwan Province "February 28th" Incident Handling Committee today issued a message stating: In order to prevent the movement of goods and materials and financial assets of government-owned and provincial-operated companies, until the resolution of the incident, any illegal movement or sale will be reported and exposed by the committee. Furthermore, if illegal sales and movements are discovered in the future, they will be strictly investigated and prosecuted. It is hoped that compatriots and employees of various provincial-operated companies will monitor each other and actively report to the committee in order to protect national property. It is reported that the committee is currently preparing to take over public enterprises. Supervisory personnel will be appointed. As for rumors about mainland personnel, it is also hoped that they will be employed. In short, all measures are exactly the same as the steps taken by the government in October 1945 when it took over various enterprises from the Japanese, which is truly both laughable and infuriating!

### The Government Plans to Formulate Supporting Emergency Measures Policies to Guide Floating Capital into Production and Adopt Incentive Measures for Handling Overseas Deposits

[This newspaper's Nanjing, 9th] According to an authoritative economist, a top economic decision-maker in the country, who told this newspaper's reporter on the morning of the 9th: After the implementation of the economic emergency measures plan, the government is formulating various policies to support it. He believes that after the above measures are implemented one by one, the national economy is expected to return to a normal state within eight or nine months, inflation can be prevented from expanding, and prosperity can be entered. It is said that the purpose of the emergency plan is only to assist in solving economic problems with political power, and the fundamental policy to be implemented is to use the power of the economy itself to guide all funds into legitimate production channels, and to solve economic problems in an economic way. At present, balancing the national budget by simply starting with expenditures is not easy. The authorities recently convened those in charge of various agencies and the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics to discuss ways to reduce unnecessary expenditures, and they all agreed that this matter is full of difficulties. However, in terms of increasing revenue, he believes that 70-80% can be achieved. On the one hand, this matter depends on increasing tax revenue, but turning state-owned enterprises into private enterprises can also increase national treasury revenue. Regarding this matter, Deputy Premier Weng has put forward a specific number, which may be further increased in the future. The main purpose of the above-mentioned and other necessary measures is to increase production. This will be seriously discussed at the Third Plenary Session of the Central Committee. The main points of the method are that the main conditions for national banks and private banks lending to industrial and agricultural groups are "the borrowed products must be returned after the loan, and after the contract is concluded, the bank will use 70% of the loan to order raw materials from merchants on behalf of the government, the manufacturers will manufacture them, and then return the products to the government, and collect all the interest." If this is the case, most of the raw materials and daily necessities made from raw materials can be controlled by the government, and there will be no more phenomena of floating capital and hoarding of daily necessities, which would endanger people's livelihoods.

[This newspaper's Nanjing, 9th] The measures for handling overseas deposits have been reviewed and approved by the Economic Policy Committee. It is said that the main points of the measures are to use incentive methods to allow overseas deposits to return to the country and engage in production. Therefore, if the holder can use it to purchase machinery, special convenience will be provided in terms of transportation and loans. As for the method proposed by some legislators to requisition a portion by the government, it seems difficult to adopt because the current situation is peacetime and cannot be compared with wartime. It is also heard that regarding the method of disposing of overseas deposits, the government is negotiating with foreign countries through diplomatic channels.

### The Hong Kong Government Oppresses Overseas Chinese and Controls New Territories Agricultural Products

We read the news item "Rumors of Communist Army Fleeing to Southern Jiangsu, Zhejiang Province Tightens Defense" on page two of your newspaper on March 7, which stated that the Communist army in northern Jiangsu had crossed south and fled into Jinshan, Qingpu, and other counties, causing disturbances, and that some residents of Jinshan had fled to Zhejiang Province.

### Yellow River Water Level Rises Again, Embankment Collapses at Garden Mouth, Situation Serious, Water Release Delayed

[Our Zhengzhou Dispatch, 9th] Since the Garden Mouth was blocked using the old method, the mouth is now only thirteen meters wide. The original plan was to close the gap from the 6th to the 15th. In recent days, spring water levels have risen. On the 7th, the flood control embankment at the eastern dam head collapsed, affecting the closing project. All employees are working hard to repair the damage. If there are no other obstacles, the closing of the mouth can definitely be completed by the 20th. At the same time, the Dazi River is still being dug, with a diversion channel about thirty li (Chinese mile) long. Water will only be released after the closing project is completed so that the Dazi River directly flushes silt eastward.

The diversion channel dug in the old riverbed downstream of the mouth was originally planned to release water on the 8th, but it has now been decided to delay it for a few days. Before the old embankment is out of danger, this water release, which is coordinated with the closing project, will naturally be postponed temporarily.

### A Major Test for the Moscow Conference

The delegations of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France arrived together in Moscow yesterday. The Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference, which is being watched by the world, opened today at the Moscow Air Force Club. This is the first Foreign Ministers Conference of 1947, and also the most important international conference since the war. The safety of the world and the happiness of mankind will depend on the outcome of this international conference. The biggest task of this Foreign Ministers Conference is to first draw up a draft treaty with Germany by the four foreign ministers, and then decide on a peace conference with Germany, so as to make the final decision on the treaty with Germany, so that post-war Europe can return to normal as soon as possible. The signing of the treaty with Germany will not only solve all the problems related to Germany but also be a model for the treaty with Japan, which will have a very important impact on the overall world situation in the future. Therefore, the opening of the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference is not only what the four powers attending the meeting have great expectations for, but all other countries in the world are also expressing concern and attention to the opening of this international conference.

Since the end of World War II, it has been nearly two years in Europe, and nearly a year and a half in the Far East. Mankind has suffered the cruel lessons of this war and, awed by the threat of atomic energy and other weapons of mass destruction, all yearn for the post-war world to step into a new era of peace and democracy as soon as possible, where everyone can live freely and peacefully coexist, and no longer suffer the threat of war. However, the post-war international situation has been turbulent, with one wave rising after another. Until the Paris Peace Conference last year, it was about to draft treaties with Italy, Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Finland. After that, the four foreign ministers met in New York, and the opinions of the four powers gradually converged, which allowed the turbulent world situation after the war to achieve a peaceful outcome. Commentators said that the first step in cleaning up the post-war mess is to conclude treaties with Germany and Japan. However, now these two major culprits of the war are ignored, and instead, treaties are signed with these dependent countries Italy, Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Finland, which inevitably feels like "abandoning the root and cherishing the branches." However, on the other hand, "avoiding the important and taking the easy" is one of the means in diplomacy. Since the opinions of various countries on the most important issues of Germany and Japan after the war cannot be unified, it is better to leave them aside for the time being and discuss them after the time is ripe. Therefore, the failure to conclude treaties with Germany and Japan for a long time is not so much a failure of international coordination after the war as a delaying tactic by diplomats from various countries. Rather than rushing to do things and forcing the conclusion of treaties with Germany and Japan, it is better to be cautious and wait for the right moment. Therefore, we do not feel that it is too late to postpone the German issue until today before we can discuss it. We only hope that the four powers can consider the overall situation of the world, sincerely exchange opinions, seek a thorough solution to the German issue, which is related to the fate of Europe, and no longer delay.

Since the main topic of the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference is various issues related to Germany, the task of this conference is to solve these problems. However, the scope of the so-called German problem is very broad and the content is extremely complex. It is not an easy task to complete this task. We also know the difficulties of the Moscow Conference from common sense. At the same time, if we analyze the speeches made by the foreign ministers of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France on their way to the conference, we can understand that we cannot be too optimistic about the success of the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference. For example, when US Secretary of State Marshall left Washington, he said: "The work of the Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference is extremely difficult. The treaty with Germany may not be drafted during the conference. The purpose of this conference is only to reach an agreement on the basic points of the treaty with Germany. If this goal can be achieved, I will be very happy." British Foreign Secretary Bevin also made a speech when he arrived in Warsaw, saying: "I hope that the Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference will be successful in solving the German problem. If I did not have this hope, I would not have traveled a long distance to Moscow." The attitude of French Foreign Minister Bidault is even more pessimistic. He told Polish reporters in Warsaw: "The scope of the German problem is vast. It is extremely difficult to solve the German problem as a whole. However, it is equally difficult to solve each individual problem related to Germany separately."

From this statement, it is not an easy task to thoroughly solve the German problem in the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference. However, the German problem is the core of post-war international problems. Whether it can be solved has a great impact on Europe and even the entire world, so it cannot be delayed any longer. Therefore, the politicians and diplomats of the four countries should do their best and use all their efforts to seek a solution to the German problem in this Moscow Conference. At the same time, peace-loving people all over the world should also provide spiritual support for the Foreign Ministers Conference to ensure the success of this Moscow Conference and open a new page in the history of the post-war peace movement. As US foreign policy expert Dulles said: "People sacrificed millions in wartime, but their ideals continue to exist. We who have been spared from death have a sacred responsibility to respect the wishes of the dead and create world peace. We will do our best to achieve this goal when we go to Moscow. However, in order to be successful, we still need the American people to support us spiritually." As long as the people of the world are united in supporting the Foreign Ministers Conference, and only allow success and not failure, we believe that no matter how broad the scope of the German problem is, no matter how complex the content of the German problem is, and no matter how divided the opinions of the four powers on the German problem are, this Moscow Conference will be able to close satisfactorily.

Finally, we cannot but reiterate our country's attitude towards the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference. Today's China is probably the most peaceful country in the current international relations, and has the same obligations as the four powers to world peace and international cooperation. We always seek the success of peace-making and always yearn for the realization of true peace, especially holding unlimited hope for this Foreign Ministers Conference that drafts a treaty with Germany. We not only hope that the four powers can seek a thorough solution to the German problem but also sincerely hope that the four powers can also reach a compromise on other international issues and become the starting point for the four powers to work together in the future. However, regarding our country's own problems, we believe that we can find a way to solve them ourselves, without the four powers worrying about our country. If the four powers include the China problem on the agenda, it will not only hurt our country's dignity and undermine the position that our country should have in the international community but also be enough to create a gradual process of international interference, which is absolutely intolerable to the people of our country. Our country's diplomatic authorities have already notified the four powers that the China problem must not be included on the agenda. The diplomatic authorities of the four countries have not expressed any objection, and our concerns no longer exist. However, it seems inevitable that the China problem will be involved inside and outside the conference, so we have to appeal loudly to the four powers, demanding that international justice not be ignored. The Yalta Conference of the past must not be allowed to be repeated today. I remember that after the secret Yalta resolution was announced in February last year, the world's opinions were in an uproar. Not only did the people of our country unanimously express indignation, but even fair-minded people in the United States unanimously condemned it as an act of betrayal. Therefore, if our country is not allowed to participate in this Moscow Conference, it has no right to discuss the China problem; without our country's consent, it should not make any agreement of any nature. This is the unanimous public opinion of the people of our country, and it is also the voice of international justice. Whether international politics can be based on justice in the future to conclude a just, reasonable, and lasting peace, and whether the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference respects the public opinion of our country, is a major test at present.

Officials on the Soviet side are quite optimistic about whether concrete decisions can be reached in the future, which is the opposite of the pessimism expressed by the British and American delegations about the chances of the conference's success. However, Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky of the Soviet Union also said when welcoming British Foreign Secretary Bevin that he hoped he had slept well on the way to Moscow, because he could not guarantee anything after Monday, which is also quite intriguing.

[Reuters, Moscow, 9th] The Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference is scheduled to open tomorrow, and preparations are in full swing. The meeting place seems to be definitely in the Air Force Club, formerly the Yalta Restaurant in the Imperial Russian era, but the official announcement has not yet been made. The houses where foreign guests are staying have been greatly renovated. In front of the Moscow Hotel, the latest-style cars are lined up in a long snake array. The waitresses of the Capital Hotel have also changed into new clothes, and other people such as elevator drivers, waiters, and children have also changed into new uniforms with high collars and copper buttons. The Cultural Relations Association has specially dispatched many female secretaries who can speak English to be stationed in the Moscow Hotel, and a small shop has been newly added to sell various gifts. Each member of the British delegation can only receive an extra allowance of five pounds for overseas service per day, and their behavior is expected to be modest. The lack of English translation will be the most difficult thing for foreign guests. The salary of the drivers used by foreign guests, including the monthly salary of the driver, is a total of seven thousand rubles. After the meeting starts on Monday, the first item on the agenda will be to discuss the report of the Berlin Allied Control Council. This document can fully show the differences in opinions of the four powers. Judging from the recent Soviet propaganda, the most difficult to solve should be the problem of economic integration of the British and American zones in Germany. The Soviet Union has previously criticized it most severely. Secondly, the future form of government in Germany, the western border of Poland, and the fate of the Ruhr-Rhine region are all the most troublesome problems. As for the Austrian problem, although there are still some unresolved points, it is expected that there will not be much difficulty in the discussion.

### German Treaty to Discuss Five Major Problems

[United Press, Moscow, 8th] Although the four foreign ministers discussed the German problem in June last year, and the four foreign resolutions also discussed it for more than a month, the four foreign ministers will still start the discussion of the German problem from the very beginning this time. The result of this conference will determine whether the East and West countries can eliminate the dozens of disputes over the German problem, especially avoiding the permanent division of Germany. The economic integration of the British and American occupation zones is also one of the key problems, because the Soviet Union believes that this will inevitably lead to the permanent division of Germany into two.

The agenda of this conference divides the German problem into the following five topics: (1) "The future political organization of Germany." The United States advocates the establishment of a German Federal Republic with scattered power. The United Kingdom agrees with this point in principle, but France advocates that the federal organization of Germany should be in the most scattered form. (2) "The eastern border issue of Germany and Poland." The United States believes that the Oder-Neisse line is not the final decision and seems to need to be revised. The United Kingdom and France do not seem to attach so much importance to this. The Soviet Union firmly opposes the revision and believes that the temporary border line decided by the Potsdam Conference should be maintained. (3) "The western border issue of Germany, including the Ruhr and Saar regions." France strongly advocates merging the Saar region and international control of the Ruhr and Rhine regions. The Soviet Union has always attached importance to using Germany's existing industry as reparations, so it advocates joint management of the Ruhr region by the four countries as a treaty in the peace treaty. (4) "The issue of reparations." The Soviet Union intends to obtain existing industries and production tools worth tens of billions of dollars as reparations. The United Kingdom and the United States have expressed opposition to this. France may agree to this, but the Soviet Union requires France to make some concessions. (5) "The issue of disarmament, purging of Nazis, and democratization." The Soviet Union accuses Western countries of not actively devoting themselves to this and failing to implement the Potsdam Agreement. This is the first problem in the report of the Four-Power Control Committee in Germany.

### Freedom of the Press During the Conference

[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 9th] McDermott, Director of Intelligence of the US State Department, recently declared: I have just received a notification from Sinitsyn, Director of the Information Department of the Soviet Foreign Ministry, that radio commentators can broadcast on Moscow Radio during the Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference. From the 10th of this month, the opening day of the conference, foreign journalists can send news about the conference situation without inspection, but they must indicate the words "Foreign Ministers Conference" on the telegram.

### Our Ambassador to the Soviet Union Visits British Foreign Secretary

[Central News Agency, Moscow, 9th Dispatch] Our Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Chuan Bingchang, visited British Foreign Secretary Bevin at the British Embassy this morning, and the conversation lasted for about 30 minutes.

### Polish-Czech Treaty Signed Today

[Agence France-Presse, Warsaw, 8th] Officials recently announced that Poland and the Czech Republic will sign a treaty of friendship and mutual assistance here on the 10th. Czech Prime Minister Gottwald will lead a delegation to arrive here at noon on the 9th.

### Italian Demands for Reparations from Germany

[Agence France-Presse, Rome, 9th] Republican presidential candidate Stassen, who is on his way to the Moscow Conference, met with Italian Prime Minister Gasperi here. Gasperi said that Italy also has demands on Germany, namely (1) compensation for the materials destroyed by the German army in Italy during the war, and (2) the industrial materials, works of art, and gold removed by the German army should be returned to Italy.

### German Central Government Will Be Established Sooner or Later

Views of German Political Leaders

[Agence France-Presse, Berlin, 8th] Kassel, leader of the Christian Democratic Party, said in a speech in Leipzig today that the Allied Control Council for Germany will authorize Germany to establish a central administrative organization, so the German government will be established sooner or later.

### Stalin Explains the Mistakes of German Commanders

[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 9th] Marshal Stalin recently replied to Colonel Lanjing, a professor at the Soviet Military Academy, explaining a military issue. Stalin said: It is by no means accidental that German Generals Ludendorff and Seeckt led to Germany's two defeats, one after the other. This is because the strategy taught by the famous German military theorist Clausewitz to German officers has proven ineffective in both world wars. Lenin, the father of the Soviet Union, was only concerned about Clausewitz in order to study his theory of the relationship between war and politics. Clausewitz was born in an era of melee combat, while we were born in an era of machine warfare. The difference lies here.

### France is Formulating a New Policy on the Vietnam Problem, The Silence of the Hanoi War is Related to This

[United Press, Paris, 8th] The newly appointed special envoy to Vietnam, Bollaert, declared today that the French government is formulating a new policy on the Vietnamese rebellion. According to a dispatch from Vietnam, not a single shot was fired in Hanoi in the past 24 hours, and there were only small-scale military activities in Haiphong, Nam Dinh, and other places. Some observers believe that the silence of the war is waiting for France to announce a new policy.

### Britain Equips the French Army for the Vietnam War

[Reuters, Paris, 8th] Reliable sources here say that in the past sixteen months, the value of military equipment directly supplied by Britain to the French army in Vietnam has reached 17.5 million pounds. In addition, according to the recent British-French agreement, Britain will supply France with various equipment worth 1.76 million pounds, including aircraft, artillery, parachutes, trucks, uniforms, and camping equipment, to equip a paratrooper division. The French Navy has also ordered 92 warships from Britain, totaling 117,000 tons, most of which are still under construction, with a total order of 11,416,000 yuan. According to the British-French agreement of September 10, 1945, Britain agreed to sell enough war equipment to France to equip three infantry divisions and one brigade of the French Far East Army, and some engineering and paratrooper units. The recent British equipment for the French paratrooper division is not within the scope of the previous agreement and was negotiated by French Chief of Staff Tassigny in London last November. Since the end of the war, British and French officers and technicians have been studying each other's military technology.

### Former King Peter of Southern (Yugoslavia) Deprived of Nationality

All Domestic Property Confiscated

[Reuters, Belgrade, 8th] The Yugoslav News Agency said: The Presidium of the National Assembly of Southern (Yugoslavia) recently issued an order to deprive former King Peter of Southern (Yugoslavia) of his nationality and confiscate all his property. Peter's close relatives are also the same.

### Japanese Communists Turn to Forming a Labor-Peasant Vanguard Party

[Kaizo-sha, Tokyo, 9th] Sano Manabu, the leader of the Japanese Communist Party's conversion faction, formed the Labor-Peasant Vanguard Party today and decided on election countermeasures, party regulations, declarations, etc. Sano himself was appointed as the chairman of the Central Executive Committee, and Kazama Johei was appointed as the secretary-general. Sano once served as the chairman of the Central Executive Committee of the Japanese Communist Party, but was later arrested in Shanghai. In 1933, he declared his conversion in prison and became a "national socialist" who advocated that the nation is superior to class. Kazama served as the chairman of the Central Executive Committee of the Japanese Communist Party in 1931, and declared his conversion after being arrested.

### Announcement of Breakdown of Negotiations with the Soviet Union; Argentina Launches Anti-Communist Campaign; America's Fearful Mentality Dissipates

[Agence France-Presse, Buenos Aires, 8th] With the upcoming Moscow Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference, the Argentine government has launched an anti-communist movement, coinciding with the breakdown of negotiations between Argentina and the Soviet Union for a friendship treaty. Argentine President Perón stated in a speech to Congress yesterday that communists are the enemy of our country and saboteurs of the Five-Year Plan. Our government issued a ban on the Communist Party in 1940, which was lifted in 1945. Such a ban may be reimplemented at any time. Furthermore, Argentine newspapers have unofficially hinted at the possibility of banning activities by national enemies and traitors, and stated that the investigative authorities have launched an anti-communist movement. It is reported that the Soviet economic delegation, which had come here to negotiate a friendship, commercial, and navigation treaty between the two countries, recently returned home abruptly, symbolizing the renewed tension in relations between Argentina and the Soviet Union. Some people in the United States originally feared that the improvement of relations between Argentina and the Soviet Union would allow the Soviet Union to gain a foothold in the Americas. However, since the Argentine President recently delivered a statement in Congress elaborating on the national political situation and announcing the breakdown of negotiations between Argentina and the Soviet Union, such fears should dissipate.

### Soviet Troops in Hungary Order Arrests; Soviets Refute U.S. Interference; Deny Depriving Smallholders Party of Legitimate Privileges

[Agence France-Presse, Hungarian Capital, 9th] The U.S. note presented to the Soviet Union on the 6th of this month, opposing the order by the Soviet military authorities to arrest former Secretary-General Kovács of the Hungarian Smallholders Party, has been refuted by Soviet commander Sviridov in Hungary. It is stated that the order and democratic regime of Hungary are not threatened by left-wing parties. The so-called deprivation of the legitimate privileges of the Smallholders Party and the intention to establish a dictatorship should not be blamed on left-wing parties. On the contrary, conspirators attempting to abolish the Constitution and overthrow the Republic are threatening the order and democratic regime of Hungary. This has been frequently acknowledged by the Smallholders Party itself, and leaders of the party, such as the current Secretary-General and Prime Minister Nagy, have made statements to this effect. If a majority of the Smallholders Party members participated in the conspiracy, then left-wing parties and the police cannot be held responsible. Furthermore, Smallholders Party members who participated in the conspiracy have confessed their crimes and agreed to forfeit their parliamentary privileges when they were elected. Therefore, there is no basis for the claim that left-wing parties are seeking a compromise with the leaders of the Smallholders Party. The conspiracy has been investigated and will soon be submitted to the Hungarian independent democratic court for handling. Therefore, I cannot accept your suggestion of jointly studying the situation in Hungary and the conspiracy, as this constitutes interference in the internal affairs of Hungary. Kovács was arrested by the Soviet military authorities for violating the legitimate rights of the Soviet occupation authorities, and your interference in this matter is also unacceptable to me. In short, the Soviet military authorities have grounds for this action and are not interfering in the internal affairs of Hungary. A copy of this Soviet response has also been sent to the British representative on the Control Council.

### Situation in Southern Korea Remains Extremely Tense

Syngman Rhee's Attitude Is Very Cautious

[Associated Press, New York, 9th] The director of the U.S. Information Service in Korea, Mr. Dunbar, who attended a meeting in Washington, stated upon arriving here today that if the United States cannot find a way to resolve the Korean issue in the next few days or weeks, the U.S.'s democratic struggle in Asia will surely fail, and there is a possibility of losing the fight for peace in the Far East. General Hodge told reporters that the United States cannot allow the establishment of an independent government in South Korea without violating the Moscow Agreement. The next day, the director of the Soviet Embassy's press office told me that Koreans in the Soviet-occupied zone had been allowed to organize an independent government, with all key positions held by Koreans. According to a dispatch from Seoul on the 4th of this month, the former provisional government will be re-established regardless of whether the United States recognizes it, while the United States claims that it will never allow its establishment. Therefore, a conflict is likely to occur in Korea within 48 hours. Syngman Rhee has considered this in detail. Rhee knows that the tense situation at that time will inevitably lead to an incident one day. Therefore, he resolutely telegraphed Kim Koo, asking him not to take any action before Rhee's return to Korea. Rhee is now ready to return to the country to lead the Koreans. Therefore, the "keys to war and peace are actually in the hands of the State Department and the War Department."

### New Invention in the Shipping Industry Can Prevent Ships from Sinking

[Agence France-Presse, Rome, 8th] A young man from Naples, Nappi, has successfully improved a German invention that can prevent ships from sinking. According to Nappi himself in an article in "The Voice," two German scientists previously invented a gas that, when attached to the stern of a ship, could prevent it from sinking because it is lighter than water. While detained in a German concentration camp, I heard about this new invention and have now installed an device that can produce the above-mentioned gas from a mixture of uranium ore, making it magnetic and tightly adhere to the stern of the ship, preventing the hull from sinking. This device can be installed on any ship.

### Supreme Soviet Delegation Arrives in Britain; Heavy Snow Hinders Activities

[Agence France-Presse, London, 8th] A delegation from the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union has arrived in Britain for a visit, consisting of 20 representatives, including two women. During their stay here, they will attend several sessions of the House of Commons. As for other plans, they have not yet been decided, as the British side wants the Soviet delegation to decide their own schedule. The Soviet delegation includes a doctor, a scientist, a writer, a miner, an electrician, and a poet, so the areas of interest are very broad. As of now, due to heavy snow and traffic difficulties, the Soviet delegation has not yet had any activities.

### Jewish Terrorists Attack British Barracks

[United Press, Jerusalem, 8th] Jewish terrorists today attacked the British barracks in Tel Aviv and the Citrus Building, where the British military headquarters is located, clashing with guards for 75 minutes.

The Security Council is scheduled to resume discussion on the U.S. trusteeship of the former Japanese mandated islands on the 12th and will debate the original eleven trusteeship questions again on the 10th.

### Mysterious Kingdom in Southwest Asia; Serious Situation in Yemen; Old King Seriously Ill and Dying, Princes Brewing Internal Strife

[Central News Agency Correspondent Wang Gong, Angola, 7th Dispatch] The oldest and most powerful autocrat in the world today is now critically ill or about to die, leaving behind several wives and children vying for the succession to this secret kingdom. This autocrat is King Yahya of Yemen. He currently rules this 20th-century Arabian Nights-style country, which borders the British protectorate of Aden, a strategic location for defending the southern entrance to the Red Sea. The King of Yemen and his subjects not only know nothing about the Sino-Japanese War, but even the State Department in Washington and the Foreign Office in London know little about them. A small number of people who are interested in the country have some knowledge of Yahya and his subjects.

The Kingdom of Yemen is about the size of our Taiwan Province, and its population is smaller than that of Shanghai. King Yahya has not clearly demarcated the borders of his country to the north and south. It borders Aden to the south and Saudi Arabia to the north. The King is 84 years old this year, and his autocratic power is even greater than that of Mussolini and Hitler. From national affairs to trivial matters such as travel and passport visas in his kingdom and the management of foreigners, he handles them all personally. In other words, the scope of his autocratic power is such that he has become the passport and visa officer of his mysterious kingdom.

Angola learned of the recent political crisis in the Kingdom of Yemen from the eighth prince of the King, who fled to Aden the day before yesterday and telegraphed the headquarters of the Arab League in Cairo, stating: "The situation in Yemen is serious," and urging Arab countries to take "urgent and effective measures to stop the bloody tragedy of the people of my poor motherland." The eighth prince is now under British protection. He has received a modern education and is progressive in his thinking. He opposes the royal guard and the King's wives and concubines, because once the old King dies, they all want to maintain their traditional autocratic feudal dictatorship. This internal strife in the royal family has a considerable impact on the world's strategic situation.

It is reported that Britain signed a treaty with Yemen in 1934, followed by other Arab countries. The United States did not have treaty relations with it until 1946, while our country has never heard of the Kingdom of Yemen, let alone diplomatic relations. The 84-year-old King of Yemen is conservative in his thinking. He believes that the United Nations is just child's play, so he has not requested to join. However, the Kingdom of Yemen is one of the main countries of the Arab League, which was established in March 1945.

Although Yemen is small in size, its people are extremely patriotic. King Yahya considers the British dependency of Aden as his lost territory and repeatedly waged wars with Britain between World War I and World War II in an attempt to recover it, but was ultimately defeated by the British Air Force. Yahya has repeatedly clashed with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, his northern neighbor. In 1935, the King of Saudi Arabia sent troops to occupy all of Yemen, withdrawing only when King Yahya recognized the King of Saudi Arabia as the "Powerful King." In 1946, Yemen signed a treaty with the United States, ceding oil fields to the United States. Therefore, political turmoil within Yemen is inevitable after the old King's death.

There are currently two possible crises: first, the King of Saudi Arabia, a friend of the United States, may take advantage of the recent mourning to occupy the entire territory; second, the eighth prince may obtain the support of Britain and the United States to realize his ideal of modernizing this mysterious Red Sea country and clash with his family. Although the Kingdom of Yemen is far from our country, we should recognize the storm that is about to come in this southwest corner of Asia.

### The U.S. May Provide Economic Aid to Greece and Hungary; President to Discuss with Congressional Leaders Today

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 9th] Political figures today emphasized that President Truman has apparently decided to ask Congress to approve aid to Greece and financial aid to Britain to enable it to maintain its troops in Greece. These figures stated that President Truman's decision to postpone his inspection of the West Indies on the eve of the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference in order to study the situation in Greece is of great significance. At the same time, Britain has also stated that it has no intention of immediately withdrawing its troops from Greece. President Truman is scheduled to hold a meeting with leaders of both major parties in Congress on the 10th, at which time the President will not only explain the U.S.'s attitude toward Greece but will also clarify its general attitude toward the Near East.

Political and diplomatic figures believe that although there will be considerable opposition in Congress, the government's request will still be accepted. The U.S. government only needs to require Greece to establish a government with a majority of liberals and the U.S. to retain control over its loans, and the criticisms in Congress will naturally subside. As for Britain's appeal to Washington, it has aroused considerable speculation here. In the past, the United States believed that Britain, surrounded by international difficulties in the Mediterranean and the Near East, was better equipped to solve problems than the United States due to its experience, resourcefulness, and the organization of its naval bases. The United States now recognizes that Britain has not recovered its pre-war status, and the United States has a heavy responsibility. In view of the increasing opposition from the Soviet Union, the United States has decided to assume this responsibility. Not only that, but the U.S. Congress may also provide significant assistance to another European country, namely Hungary, which is not impossible. The opposition between Britain and the United States and the Soviet Union in Hungary has become apparent. One example is that the U.S. State Department protested on the 6th of this month against the arrest of former Secretary Kovács of the Hungarian Smallholders Party by the Soviet authorities in Hungary. The United States believes that this is tantamount to interfering in Hungary's internal affairs and violates the Yalta Agreement. Regarding this matter, the Soviet Union has issued a strongly worded reply, refuting the U.S.'s accusations.

British Ambassador to the U.S. Meets with Acheson

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 8th] U.S. Undersecretary of State Acheson held talks with British Ambassador to the U.S., Lord Inverchapel, this morning to discuss matters. According to well-informed sources, the topic of discussion was probably the Greek question, but Lord Inverchapel himself declined to make any statement. It is believed that Acheson's meeting with Lord Inverchapel is related to preparations for secret meetings held by the White House and the State Department.

[Reuters, New York, 8th] The "New York World-Telegram" today published a full-page advertisement from the "American Democratic Greek Committee" opposing U.S. intervention in Greece and supporting British aggression against Greece. The "New York Sun" also hopes that the government will seriously consider before deciding to aid Greece.

### British Air Force Stationed in Hong Kong

[Reuters, Singapore, 8th] The British Air Ministry has allocated the 209th Squadron to be stationed in Hong Kong, naming it the 209th Hong Kong Squadron.

### Dutch Release U.S. Merchant Ship After Unloading

[Agence France-Presse, The Hague, 8th] The U.S. ship "Pelham," which was detained by the Dutch Navy, has been released by the Dutch side after the U.S. government lodged a protest with the Netherlands. However, according to those in charge here, the Dutch government has no intention of abandoning its control over export trade to Java and Sumatra at present.

[United Press, Batavia, 8th] The Dutch port authorities today began unloading $3 million worth of rubber and quinine from the U.S. merchant ship "Pelham," which was detained last Friday. However, because the American sailors on the ship refused to cooperate, the hatches were opened in two places under armed guard, and the cargo was unloaded into the Tanjung Priok harbor dock using cranes.

### Atomic Bomb Manufacturing; Patents Cannot Be Permanently Protected; Power of Cosmic Rays Even More Astonishing

[This newspaper] London, 9th Broadcast: Famous mathematician Lewis said: The U.S. monopoly on the atomic bomb definitely cannot be maintained for five years. It is said that within five years, any non-industrial country can manufacture atomic bombs as long as they have uranium production.

[Associated Press, Washington, 8th] According to the famous atomic physicist, Dr. Swann, who delivered a speech at the National Geographic Society here last night, the energy emitted by cosmic rays is at least 10,000 times stronger than that of atomic bombs. Under certain circumstances, it is 100 billion times stronger. However, these cosmic rays have not yet been controlled, and the source of cosmic rays outside the Earth's atmosphere is still unknown. Dr. Swann is the director of the Bartol Research Foundation and participated in the B-29 experimental flight laboratory tests last summer, with many findings.

### Indian Congress Party Appeals to Muslim League to Cooperate in Eliminating Ethnic Disputes

[Associated Press, New Delhi, 8th] The Indian Congress Party today appealed to the Muslim League to establish peace between the two ethnic groups in India and end the recent riots in Punjab. The Congress Party Executive Committee also requested the Muslim League to elect representatives for a peace conference to help eliminate disputes between the two religions and reach an agreement before Britain withdraws from India. The Executive Committee has also resolved to propose to the Muslim League to divide Punjab into Indian and Muslim zones. This proposal is intended as a slight concession from the Congress Party to the Muslim League. The Muslim League has not yet responded quickly to this, but it is believed that senior leaders of the League will accept the Congress Party's request. The Executive Committee also appealed to all ethnic groups and political parties in India to stop all conflicts and riots.

[Central News Agency, New Delhi, 8th] The Congress Party Executive Committee today decided to welcome the British government's statement on the date of withdrawal from India and invited representatives of the Muslim League to hold a meeting with representatives of the Congress Party to discuss issues related to the future Indian constitution.

Conflict Does Not Stop, Gandhi Willing to Die

[Agence France-Presse, New Delhi, 9th] It is learned that if Hindus and Muslims in Punjab cannot restore their fraternal relationship, Mahatma Gandhi intends to fast to death. Gandhi once said that he would rather die than witness Indians and Muslims slaughtering each other on the eve of India's complete freedom. Following the recent massacre in Bengal, serious chaos broke out in Punjab.

### Rumors That the Moscow Conference Will Discuss the China Question; The City Council Telegraphed the Whole Country Urging the Central Government to Negotiate and Oppose Interference; Chinese Affairs Are Not to Be Interfered with by Other Countries

The Shanghai Municipal Council, in order to oppose the Moscow Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference discussing the China question, yesterday specially telegraphed the councils of provinces and cities across the country, stating: "To the councils of all provinces and cities across the country: It has been found that our country has relied on the wise leadership of Chairman Chiang and the arduous struggle of the military and civilians across the country for eight years of the War of Resistance, defeating the enemy and finally winning victory. We are at a time of striving to govern and complete the great cause of national construction, but the Chinese Communist Party deliberately incites war and obstructs the progress of national policy. Although Marshal Marshall has made painstaking efforts to mediate and coordinate, the government has shown magnanimity and made concessions, but due to the stubbornness of the Communist Party, the peace talks have failed to achieve success, which is regrettable. Fortunately, our government is responding to the difficult times, only hoping to advance to constitutionalism, and is still following the established policy, responding to the people's demands, convening the National Assembly, and completing the constitutional work. On the one hand, it is striving to quell the rebellion, restore transportation, and promote unification, so as to stabilize society and increase production. On the other hand, it is expanding the foundation of the government and extensively inviting talents from across the country to participate, so as to prepare for the implementation of constitutionalism. All of this is the goal of our government's efforts and what we hope for. However, it has recently been rumored that the Moscow Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference has proposed to discuss the China question. And the Chinese Communist Party and its followers are even dreaming of welcoming international interference, which is truly strange. Chinese affairs, the Chinese people have the right to decide for themselves, not to be interfered with by other countries. The secret agreement of the Yalta Conference is still deeply painful. No matter what international conference, if China does not participate, it must absolutely not be allowed to discuss the China question. If there is a unilateral resolution, no matter where it comes from, China will not be bound by it in the slightest. Our government should also clearly announce its attitude to prevent international conspiracies. Therefore, the first session of the second general assembly of this council decided that since there are rumors outside, the central government should be urged to negotiate quickly and oppose the Moscow Conference discussing the China question. In addition to requesting the National Government to adopt this proposal, we are sending this telegram for your reference, and hope that your council will unanimously advocate for it. Sincerely, Shanghai Municipal Council, Yin Jia Yin."

### Zhu Shiming Returned Home to Report on His Duties and Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday Aboard a U.S. Military Ship

General Zhu Shiming, head of our delegation to Japan, returned home on the morning of the 7th aboard the U.S. military ship "General Hughes" with one staff officer.

### An Italian Ship Arrives in Shanghai to Carry Overseas Chinese Back to Italy

[This newspaper] The Italian ship "Scstriere" arrived on the 7th, represented by Richang Company, to carry Italian overseas Chinese back to Italy. It was originally planned to sail to Tianjin the day before yesterday to carry overseas Chinese from North China, but it failed to set sail because it did not obtain permission from our government. The Italian flag on the ship has been changed in style, so some mistakenly thought it was French. According to Richang Company, the agent, the ship came to Shanghai empty and does not intend to load any goods except for carrying overseas Chinese back to Italy. The rumor that it will load 4,000 pieces of soybeans to Italy is not true.

### Reporting Profit Tax Unable to Complete the Form as Scheduled; Rubber and Other Industries Will Petition This Morning

[This newspaper] Fifty-eight units of the Rubber, Hardware, Department Store, and other industry associations in this city held a joint meeting at the City Chamber of Commerce at 4 p.m. yesterday regarding the matter of the Direct Taxation Bureau's deadline for reporting profit tax.

The industry associations were also unable to complete the form within the deadline for all the reporting procedures. It was decided to go to the Direct Taxation Bureau collectively to petition at 9 a.m. today. Zhao Xianji, Hong Nianzu, Ba Lingyun, Wang Jingdong, Cai Hezhang, and others were appointed as spokespersons.

### Gao Shiyu Returns from Inspection Tour: Discusses the General Situation of European and American Textile Industries, Encourages Research and Production, and Emphasizes the Urgent Need to Improve and Strengthen the Export of Chinese Raw Silk

Gao Shiyu, a Bachelor of Science in Textile Dyeing from the United Kingdom, who taught at the Central Vocational School and concurrently served as the General Manager of the Chongqing Leshan Minzhi Textile Dyeing Company, went to Europe and the United States last April to conduct a comprehensive inspection of the post-war textile industry. Mr. Gao returned to Shanghai on the 7th aboard the McKinley Nasu, and a reporter visited Mr. Gao at his residence yesterday to inquire about his experiences and impressions of the trip.

Intensified Production of Artificial Wool

Mr. Gao first stated: "The United Kingdom is a leading country in the wool textile industry. After the war, it urgently sought to restore its previous production volume, but it has not been able to achieve this in the short term. The reason is the lack of manpower, as those distributed in various occupied areas have not been fully repatriated. Although the wool textile industry has not yet achieved greater expansion, the entire industry has indeed entered a new trend. The British are now working hard to research artificial fibers and using peanut kernels as raw materials to manufacture artificial wool. In terms of improving artificial fibers, they are striving to strengthen the raw materials, absorb water pores, and make them more comfortable than transparent colloid silk, and the selling price is low. This type of fiber can also be used as a substitute for wool. Past products were once suspended due to the war. It is expected that the British artificial wool production will be intensified next year.

Strikes are Extremely Rare

Regarding management and sales, strikes are extremely rare in the UK due to traditional habits. Moreover, the social welfare organization is very thorough. Workers earning less than 250 pounds per year are required to have social insurance, and they have considerable protection in case of death or illness, so their lives can be stable. The sales targets are: (1) colonies, (2) Europe, (3) South America, (4) the Far East, and (5) the home country. In terms of profit, South America is better than Europe, but due to environmental factors, they would rather choose Europe than South America. The UK is an island country, and agricultural products are inherently insufficient. The island nation tightens its belt, strengthens exports, and exchanges for foreign exchange. Meat, eggs, and other foods are all subject to control. Currently, Canada's construction is progressing rapidly, especially in Ottawa. However, due to the vast land and sparse population, the future development is unlimited. The main product is the utilization of forests to manufacture pulp. In addition to half being used as raw materials for papermaking, the rest will be supplied for the manufacture of rayon. Currently, the supply of this item is largely above Sweden.

American Cotton Production is Extremely Large

After the war, the textile industry in the United States was extremely prosperous, and cotton production was particularly large. The government, with foresight, encouraged farmers to produce, and pre-determined a limited price for the products. If the price falls below the limited price, the government will buy them all. The improvement of animal husbandry has been effective, and the products can rival those of Australia, but the quantity is still insufficient. Artificial fiber achievements are the best, entirely manufactured by synthetic methods, using coal as the main starting point to become elastic nylon fiber. The most advanced one is almost equal to real silk, and it is divided into continuous and high-strength cotton fibers. Its cost can be one to two times lower than real silk, and its durability is more than dozens of times higher. The only drawback is that it is not as warm as real silk.

The United States is Willing to Assist in Our Construction

At this point, Mr. Gao reiterated that raw silk is our country's main export, and it should be improved. However, at a time when the world is competing to promote artificial silk and artificial wool, we should also catch up quickly and not ignore it. Regarding management, Mr. Gao said: "Although there are occasional labor disputes in the United States, the disputes are not serious. The key to the knot is: (1) the treatment is not as good as during the war, causing dissatisfaction, and (2) some people with slight savings temporarily live a leisurely life, and then work again after their savings are exhausted. As a result, both labor and management suffer greatly during the strike period, and the profit-makers are the general stores, taking the opportunity to raise prices. The sales method is the opposite of the United Kingdom, with supplying the home country as the first priority, and the surplus is developed overseas. The United States is very interested in our country's industrial construction and is very willing to assist from the sidelines, because if China's industrial construction is successful, the United States' commercial position in the Far East can be permanently based on this. As for our country's recent economic measures to change the exchange rate, according to the views of general American economists, it is believed that China is encouraging exports in exchange for foreign exchange. In the future, if foreign exchange increases, American goods can be exported continuously, which is more flexible and fluid than exhausting foreign exchange reserves.

### Prosecutor Practices Boxing: Ding Tongjun Offers Free Instruction

Huang Liang, the Chief Prosecutor of the Shanghai Local Court Procuratorate, recently encouraged his colleagues, saying: "Boxing can strengthen the body. I hope everyone can use their spare time to practice with Prosecutor Ding Tongjun."

### Seeking to Reduce International Telegraph Fees and Open Direct Wireless Circuits

The International Radio Station of the Ministry of Communications, under orders, will change the news telegram fees sent to European and American countries, which are valued in US dollars converted into national currency, from the 10th. According to the exchange rate of the US dollar of the Central Bank, each US dollar is calculated at 12,000 yuan in national currency. At the same time, the exchange rate of the gold franc to the national currency is also changed to 4,000 yuan in national currency for each gold franc. According to the person in charge of the station, in order to reduce the price of international telegrams, the station has repeatedly tried to open more direct international wireless circuits. The recently opened direct circuit includes the Central Java International Wireless Circuit between Shanghai and Obadavia. In addition, the direct circuit between China and South America is currently under test. Once the formal direct report is opened, the quotations from China to South America will also be greatly reduced.

### Male Corpse Found on Jiaotong Road Identified as Vegetable Vendor Murdered

[Reported by this newspaper] A male corpse was found in a small stream near Wangjiajing on Jiaotong Road, Zhabei, around 5:00 PM the day before yesterday. The corpse had been strangled and had knife wounds on the head and body. According to police investigations, the deceased was named Hou Adi, 22 years old. The day before yesterday, he rode a bicycle carrying two baskets of leeks, apparently intending to sell them in Shanghai. When passing by the area, he was intercepted by several Hakka vegetable vendors who tried to buy them at a low price. A verbal dispute occurred, resulting in him being beaten to the ground and eventually murdered. Afterwards, the police station in charge sent personnel to thoroughly investigate and issue an arrest warrant for the perpetrators to bring them to justice.

### Eliminating Scalped Tickets and Clearing Out Ticket Touts: Meeting Convened with Cinema Representatives to Discuss Five Elimination Methods

The activities of "flying ticket gangs" (i.e., ticket scalpers) selling black market movie tickets in major cinemas in the city are extremely rampant. In order to thoroughly eliminate them, the Municipal Police Bureau convened the persons in charge of the city's fourteen first-run cinemas, ticket sellers, etc., at 3:00 PM yesterday to jointly discuss effective elimination methods, and decided on: (1) The Municipal Police Bureau will order the volunteer police brigade to continue to strictly eliminate them and severely punish the captured ticket scalpers, and send their leaders to the Caohejing reception center. (2) The Municipal Police Bureau will clearly order all cinemas that both parties involved in black market ticket sales will be treated as violating police regulations. (3) Strictly investigate and deal with cinema employees who collude with ticket scalpers. (4) Strictly investigate and deal with local branch police officers who accept bribes and protect ticket scalpers. (5) Each cinema will designate two liaison officers to contact the Municipal Police Bureau, provide information, and assist police officers in the elimination work.

### Public Training Alumni Congress: Spirit Unfading from the Past Years, 4,200 Members Inspected, Silk Banner Presented to Commander Xuan

[Reported by this newspaper] The Municipal Public Training Alumni Association held a member congress at the racetrack yesterday morning and was inspected by the commander. A total of 4,225 public training alumni attended, and guests included Municipal Council Speaker Pan Gongzhan, Municipal Party Committee Chairman Fang Zhi, Garrison Commander Fu Zhengmo, Garrison Headquarters Commander Xuan Yuewu, and former Public Training Office Director Li Xiangqi, Deputy Director Jiang Huaisu, and Chief Captain Tao Yishan. After the flag-raising ceremony, the congress chairman Li Xiangqi gave a speech, stating: "Public training has been going on for ten years. During the Anti-Japanese War, public training students assisted in the Anti-Japanese War and established meritorious service. Ten years later, today, we can hold a member congress here, and so many students have attended with such enthusiasm, and the spirit is not fading from the past years, which is something to be proud of. In the future, we should work hard to encourage ourselves and complete the mission of nation-building." Then, Chairman Fang gave a speech, saying that the students must have infinite feelings in their hearts that they can hold a congress in the racetrack today. Speaker Pan said in his speech: "When public training began ten years ago, I was working in the municipal government. At that time, we were preparing for the Anti-Japanese War. Although the Anti-Japanese War has been completed, the north of the Yangtze River and the south of the Yellow River are still in turmoil, and Shanghai can still be as peaceful as usual, which is due to the security of the local area. I hope that the students will be the vanguard of the people, assist the authorities in maintaining law and order, maintain social peace, and work hard for nation-building." Commander Xuan and Public Training Alumni Association Chairman Tao Yishan also delivered speeches one after another. The public training students unanimously elected Wang Xiaolai to give a reply. The inspection began at half-past nine. Although the weather was cold yesterday morning, the public training students all marched forward with neat steps and without hesitation. After the inspection, the Student Union's representative presented a silk banner with the words "Screen of Songhu" to Commander Xuan. The ceremony ended at ten o'clock.

### Amputated Fingers of Abandoned Baby Found Beside Trash Can

Beside a trash can in the Tianbaoli North Alley of Xinjiang Road, yesterday morning at about 11 o'clock, someone found an abandoned baby girl about two years old. Upon closer inspection, bloodstains were evident on her left hand, and two fingers had been chopped off. Onlookers were discussing the matter, some saying it was the harm of a stepmother, others saying it was an illegitimate child. After being sent to the Municipal Fourth Hospital for examination, it was determined that the baby was suffering from tuberculous meningitis. She died at 4:00 PM. The North Railway Station Police Station learned of this and sent Inspector Liu Zichang to investigate. It was learned that the baby's fingers were injured by a sharp instrument. It is speculated that it was an old superstitious belief that the fingers of a sick baby were cut off to prevent them from coming back to demand debts next time.

### Dai Cuilun Takes Over the Symphony Orchestra: Takes on a New Mission of Art, Plans to Perform Once Every Half Month with Extremely Low Ticket Prices, Uses Opera to Obtain Universal Educational Significance

[Special Feature by This Newspaper] The Shanghai Symphony Orchestra, with a history of more than 60 years, has a deep impression in people's minds. The orchestra often had grand performances before the war. Even last year, after the municipal government took it over from the enemy and puppet regime during the victory, it often had public performances. Due to budget constraints and personnel changes, the orchestra has temporarily suspended rehearsal and performance activities for the past two months.

The orchestra not only has a long and glorious history, but it is also the only and most large-scale orchestra in the Far East. During the era of the Municipal Council, it was its most prosperous period. Many international orchestra masters came to Shanghai in an endless stream to participate in the orchestra's performances. The regret is that because its standards for admission were very high, only a few Chinese people were able to be selected into the orchestra for decades. Looking at it as an object for the idle to spend time, we will not talk about its expensive ticket prices and the style of losing educational significance in the past. If we say that it is a universal agency for proper music education and training of Chinese orchestral talents, anyone who has a knowledge of music and art and loves it should agree to make it continue to exist and give it utmost support to promote and develop it.

He Did Not Refuse the Arduous Task

Mayor Wu attaches great importance to this point. Therefore, even under the circumstances that the municipal financial resources are extremely tight today, he is still determined to take out 30 million yuan per month to maintain the existence of the orchestra, and has entrusted Dai Cuilun (see photo), president of the Shanghai Conservatory of Music, to serve as the new director of the orchestra. This means that the orchestra has shouldered a new mission of art education from now on.

Cuilun was one of the few Chinese people who participated in the orchestra's performances in the past. He is particularly familiar with its past, especially the personnel relations in the orchestra. Mayor Wu sincerely invited him to help out this time, even though he himself was already overwhelmed by the affairs of the Shanghai Conservatory of Music, and his family did not want him to add to his excessive hard work. However, he knew that if the orchestra unfortunately collapsed, it would take at least another twenty years to establish a symphony orchestra like this in China. Because the orchestra's instruments and talents are rare even internationally, especially in terms of sheet music, many valuable famous pieces are now out of print.

Performance Income Used as a Fund

For this simple belief, he resolutely agreed to Mayor Wu's commission and took over for six months. He decided to take over today.

In a delicate building close to the street, the reporter heard a detailed description of the orchestra's past and targeted the past problems. He said: "After taking over in the future, the first thing to do is to enable the orchestra's musicians to obtain a reasonable and stable life. In this regard, he has already obtained the mayor's approval to give 30 million yuan per month. In the future, all performance income will be used as the orchestra's fund. He plans to perform once every half month in the future and set the ticket price extremely low so that general students and citizens have the opportunity to listen to the performances. In order to welcome international guests and special performances, the ticket price may be set a little higher. Based on his past experience in Chongqing, he also plans to use the opera method to follow the universal educational significance. In order to enable the performance to achieve the expected results, he will require that every musician can abide by the necessary discipline when practicing four times a week.

Starting next month, we will hear the orchestra's performance again. Wait, this is a new sound!

### Fire in Pig Farm in Beixinjing, Carelessness in Brick Shop on Xizang Road

[Reported by this newspaper] A fire broke out at the Xiexing Pig Farm on Xihu Road, Beixinjing Town, around 4:00 PM the day before yesterday. Thick smoke billowed up, but fortunately, workers from the nearby shipyard bravely came to the rescue and put out the fire. A total of two bungalows were burned down. The Xinjing Branch Bureau investigated the truth of the fire and learned that it was caused by a neighboring firecracker workshop trying out firecrackers, and sparks fell on the reed mat shed of the pig farm. The owner of the workshop was immediately detained by the branch bureau for handling.

Due to carelessness, a fire broke out on the third floor of Dafeng Brick and Tile Shop, No. 78 Xizang South Road (opposite the former Second District Police Station), at around 10:20 yesterday morning. Because the wind was very strong, the flames spread in all directions, and immediately spread to the third floor of the neighboring Xingmao Sugar Shop, No. 79, and the residents of No. 80. After the Songshan District and other fire departments dispatched vehicles to rescue, the fire was extinguished around noon, and the loss was still slight.

At the same time, the hospital does not charge any fees for prenatal examination and postpartum visits for pregnant women.

Truck Kills Woman

[Reported by this newspaper] At 1:30 yesterday afternoon, a ten-wheeled truck sped through the intersection of Nanjing Road and Zhejiang Road, killing a woman, Li Zhou (23 years old). Officer No. 1037 discovered this and ordered the truck to stop, but the truck ignored the order and tried to escape from west to east. The officer then jumped onto the Jeep card No. 18947 of the Good Rescue Headquarters and bravely chased after it. When the car arrived at the intersection of Henan Road and Nanjing Road, the red light was on, so it was blocked. The officer hurriedly jumped down, intending to detain the driver and bring him to the bureau, but he tripped and fell to the ground, injuring his right knee, and blood flowed like a torrent. The Huangpu Branch Bureau sent the injured police officer to the hospital for treatment, but the ten-wheeled truck that caused the accident was still not apprehended and is under investigation.

### Wu Tiecheng's Sixtieth Birthday Celebration

On March 9th, the thirty-sixth year of the Republic of China, it was the sixtieth birthday of Mr. Wu Tiecheng of Zhongshan. Nearly a thousand of his former and current subordinates, deeply grateful for his past favors, wished to offer words of congratulation before the formal toast. However, they worried about the order of precedence in serving Mr. Wu and the potential for discrepancies in their duties, making it difficult to ensure a smooth and comprehensive celebration. Therefore, they appointed Mr. Pan Gongzhan as the mediator to explain the matter in detail to Zhao, and asked Zhao to write something for the occasion. Zhao thought that offering words of praise to a person celebrating their longevity was a private matter, and that writing on behalf of others would lack sincerity. Thus, he hesitated to accept. Mr. Pan said, "Mr. Wu is a man of the world, and also your friend. You should express your sincere thoughts freely and without reservation." Zhao agreed.

Mr. Wu was a founding contributor to the revolutionary party. Let us first examine his role in the history of the revolutionary party. When the Tongmenghui (United League) was first established, a concern was raised among comrades: if the revolution focused solely on destruction and all talent was poured into it, scholarship would inevitably suffer. In the future, when construction was needed, there might be a shortage of skilled individuals. Therefore, some advocated dividing talent into two groups: one dedicated to implementing the revolution and the other dedicated to scholarship. At that time, Zhao had failed and fled to Japan after the Liuyang and Liling uprising. Believing that direct confrontation was not his forte, he requested to study in England to await the opportune moment. However, his resolve proved weak, and he achieved little in his studies. He did not participate in the crucial stages of the revolution, falling far behind his comrades. Those comrades, on the other hand, focused their efforts and did not delve deeply into scholarly pursuits. In the early years of the Republic, when laws were being discussed and governance was being established, they inevitably struggled to cope, revealing their shortcomings. They had not anticipated the emergence of outstanding talents from within the country, like Mr. Wu. Born with the refined qualities of Guangdong in the bustling city of Jiujiang, he studied classical texts in his youth and became well-versed in worldly affairs as he grew older. Sharing similar aspirations and engaging in harmonious correspondence with the late Chairman Lin Gongzi Chao, he openly pursued diplomatic strategies and secretly cultivated virtuous and heroic individuals. In the years leading up to the Xinhai Revolution, along the Yangtze River, he had already established a network of unwavering enemies against the Manchurian government. All of this was a natural convergence inspired by Mr. Wu's admiration for Dr. Sun Yat-sen's brilliance. Upon receiving the orders of the Tongmenghui, he carried them out with utmost diligence. When the Wuchang Uprising broke out, Jiujiang responded even before Shanghai. As is the constant principle of physics, things with real substance have louder voices, so this was no wonder. At that time, Mr. Wu was just over twenty years old, exuding youthful vigor and determined to bring clarity to the world. Although he served as the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the military government and as the representative of Jiangxi Province at the constitutional conference in Beijing, personally participating in the election of the provisional president, he recognized the treacherous ministers who were betraying the country. As the situation had been revealed, Dr. Sun Yat-sen humbly stepped down, and the efforts failed. Mr. Wu was particularly displeased. After the defeat of the Gui-Chou Rebellion, comrades fled and went into hiding, knowing that it was temporarily impossible to contend with the treacherous. He followed the principle of nurturing strength in obscurity and dedicated himself to learning. He acquired expertise in both political and economic sciences, drawing upon the best of them and applying them broadly. This was during his time at Meiji University in Japan. Soon after, he went to America, making the overthrow of Yuan Shikai his mission. He studied diligently day and night, further advancing his knowledge. Before long, Dr. Sun Yat-sen established his headquarters in Guangzhou as the Grand Marshal, and summoned Mr. Wu to serve as his aide. He was soon promoted to Chief Aide of the Grand Marshal's headquarters. Not long after that, he was appointed Director of the Provincial Police Department and concurrently served as the Director of the Guangzhou Municipal Public Security Bureau. Criminals and bandits were immediately subdued, and the prevalence of theft declined. From this point on, Mr. Wu's ability to manage complex situations began to manifest itself. Moreover, Guangdong, a new revolutionary base, and the Pinglin area, were fiercely contested by both sides. Internal treachery was brewing, and mercenary armies were rampant. For several years, the Grand Marshal relied on Mr. Wu as his right-hand man to carefully consider and respond to situations, commanding with composure. It is impossible to know the extent to which the chaos would have escalated if it were not for him. Among these events, Chen Jiongming's rebellion was an unprecedented act of treason, making suppression extremely difficult. When Mr. Wu accompanied the Grand Marshal on the Northern Expedition as the commander of the guard army, the army was stationed in Shaoguan. Suddenly, the Guangzhou merchant corps, instigated by foreign lackeys, colluded with bandits and launched a major rebellion. The Grand Marshal solely entrusted Mr. Wu with a handwritten order to immediately return and quell the rebellion. Mr. Wu acted swiftly, traveling day and night without delay. He led several thousand troops and arrived in Guangzhou overnight, employing both appeasement and suppression, and the rebellion was quickly subdued. This exemplifies Mr. Wu's ability to adapt to changing circumstances and make decisive judgments in times of crisis. In 1924, the Kuomintang was reorganized. Mr. Wu was ordered to work with comrades such as Liao Zhongkai and Sun Ke to plan and implement a completely new structure. Mr. Wu was appointed as a temporary central committee member, served as the acting garrison commander of Guangzhou, and concurrently served as an executive committee member of the Guangzhou Municipal Party Headquarters, as well as the minister of labor and propaganda departments. He combined party, government, and military powers in his hands, expanding and promoting them with ease. Mr. Wu's grand plans and great strategies were once again demonstrated. After the success of the Northern Expedition, talented individuals emerged like clouds, and Mr. Wu was increasingly relied upon. He shouldered important responsibilities one after another. In 1928, he was ordered to comfort the Northeast Army. The frontier regions were bitterly cold, with temperatures plummeting to 35 degrees below zero. Yet, Mr. Wu wholeheartedly followed his duties, filled with joy, traveling between Qiqihar, Zhalantun, and Boketu, where the icy and snowy lands asked for his service, the different ethnicities lived in harmony, as if he was simply doing something simple, as if he were traveling to the moon; at that time, Liaoning and Shenyang had only recently been placed under national authority, and the people were still discontented. The politicians and scholars in the north, such as Gu Shaochuan and Luo Junren, were difficult to gather from afar. Zhao also loitered at the Beiling Academy as a teacher, and the cause of unification seemed to hang by a thread. As a senior official from the central government, Mr. Wu planned strategies in the background, closely advised the headquarters, openly engaged with various officials, and every smile and frown carried great significance. During gatherings, he consistently demonstrated brilliance. For two or three years, the nation had no worries about the northeast, and people at home and abroad shared a common hatred. Then came the September 18th Incident and the January 28th Incident, marking the prelude to the great war. Zhao knew Mr. Wu's ability and purpose. Zhao knew Mr. Wu's mind was on the nation. Sincerity breeds clarity, and clarity breeds sincerity, and Mr. Wu possessed both. Shanghai, a place where Chinese and foreigners mingled, was notoriously difficult to govern. Due to unequal treaties, it had become a virtual colony, and its customs differed greatly. Treacherous merchants and unruly people had formed a powerful force that was difficult to shake, hindering governance. As the mayor, Mr. Wu implemented reforms and improvements, striking a balance in his actions. The good people appreciated him, and even the bad people did not resent him. The songs praising him have continued to be sung to this day. What is truly worthy of admiration is that Mr. Wu had only been in office for a short time when the Hongqiao Incident occurred. He managed to pacify the military and the people, ensuring that supplies were not lacking, turning the initial battle against a powerful enemy in the southeast into a national glory. The amount of effort Mr. Wu expended cannot be fully measured. In the following five or six years, Mr. Wu managed Shanghai, planned the central district, mobilized manpower and resources, and directed them towards a single goal. Grand plans were initiated, and prosperity flourished. He foresaw that Shanghai would become the leading metropolis in East Asia, comparable to the ancient Lingtai. Then the Lugouqiao Incident occurred. In the early stages of the War of Resistance, Mr. Wu was transferred to govern Guangdong. With the reverence of a native, he served as a shelter for the people, emphasizing both expediency and principle, and implementing defense strategies. Zhao once wrote an evaluation of Mr. Wu, calling him the "Best Governor of Internal Defense". It was by no means an empty praise. However, the enemy's forces were fierce, and the coastal regions were in danger. The overall situation was such that it could not be resisted by the efforts of one person alone. Coincidentally, the central party governance was being reorganized, and there was a need for someone to manage it. Mr. Wu became the chief secretary of the central party headquarters. Skilled and familiar with the work, he demonstrated the style of Yang Shu's light chariot and simple belt, responding to emergencies with agility and adjusting policies as needed. Since the establishment of the party, he had been in charge of the central hub, harmonizing the members, explaining principles, and defining righteousness, ensuring clarity both at the center and on the borders. In that position, who other than Mr. Wu would be so trusted and respected? During this period, Mr. Wu was appointed to comfort overseas Chinese communities, visiting major ports such as Singapore, Penang, and the Dutch East Indies. He meticulously explained the central government's intentions, the leaders' anti-Japanese strategy, and the steps involved, like pouring refreshing nectar into the minds of every overseas Chinese citizen. As a result, the call to action spread like wildfire. People eagerly returned to the motherland to serve the country, and donations poured in, with everyone fearing they would be left behind. The nation sent an envoy to Southeast Asia to conduct propaganda work, which was unprecedented. The sincerity of Southeast Asia towards the nation, and the collection of donations, was on a scale never seen before. If it were not for Mr. Wu's efforts to organize and facilitate everything, how could such a result have been achieved? Alas. Mr. Wu has experienced both internal and external affairs, exhausting his energy and spirit. As he enters his sixtieth year, and with national affairs becoming even more critical, the nation relies on him even more. Mr. Wu writes and speaks tirelessly, using medicine as sustenance and working day and night, unable to find even a moment of leisure. A little over a week ago, he suffered from high blood pressure and sought medical treatment in Shanghai. Following the doctor's orders, he rested quietly for over ten days, not receiving guests. Zhao visited him frequently, and Mr. Wu said, "These past two weeks have been a haven for me in my dreams. In my life, I have never been away from my duties for so long." Zhao was deeply moved. Zhao and Mr. Wu differ in their academic backgrounds and political affiliations, but they have been friends for over thirty years. Their relationship is as pure as water between gentlemen. Even after many years of not seeing each other, they remain as close as if they had just met. They often engage in discussions, never letting personal matters interfere with public duties, nor vice versa. In Zhao's view, having always been fair to others, Mr. Wu does not neglect scholarship due to his work, nor does he neglect his duties due to leisure. He holds great ambitions and harmonizes principles and expediency. His conduct and interactions with others are all logical. Finding someone like him in this era is rare. He also devotes himself to the party and remains loyal to the nation. In the past, Zhao held the biased view that scholarship and career could not be pursued simultaneously. Now he sees that a wren cannot understand the vastness of the Kunpeng, and a carp in a puddle cannot comprehend the breadth of the ocean. If Su Shi were alive today and could meet Mr. Wu, in addition to admiring Han and Fan, he would surely say that he had seen all the wonders of the world and would have no regrets. Zhao shared this view with Mr. Pan, who in turn conveyed it to over a thousand comrades, who all agreed wholeheartedly. Zhao hopes that by expressing these sentiments before the audience during the celebration, he may earn a smile from Mr. Wu. This is the preface.

### Ministry of Education Recently Issues Order to Abolish Examination Method for Primary and Secondary School Grades

[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 9th] The Ministry of Education has recently ordered the abolition of the method for examining the academic performance of students in secondary and primary schools by educational administrative agencies at all levels, which was established before the war, and has instructed the education departments and bureaus of all provinces and cities to comply. It is reported that the reason for the abolition is that the Ministry of Education is simplifying regulations and gradually abolishing unnecessary rules and regulations, and this is not limited to this one method. As recent revisions to secondary school regulations already include provisions for examining student grades, and local educational administrative agencies have supervisors who inspect and examine schools, while schools have academic affairs departments that are responsible for examinations at all times, it is not necessary for everything to be stipulated by the central government, and local authorities should be responsible for handling these matters themselves.

National Education Advancement Association Holds Second General Membership Meeting Yesterday; More Than 3,000 People Attend, Including Director Gu

Since its establishment last autumn, the Shanghai National Education Advancement Association has nearly 5,000 public and private elementary school teachers and staff participating, making it the largest organization in Shanghai's education community. Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, the association held its second general membership meeting at the Municipal Gymnasium. Director Gu of the Municipal Education Bureau, Deputy Director Li, education expert Du Zuozhou, and principals and teachers from public and private elementary schools, totaling more than 3,500 people, attended. Chief Zhu Ruoti presided over the meeting and reported on the two major goals of the National Education Advancement Association: (1) to assist the government in promoting national education, and (2) to unite colleagues and promote welfare and continuing education work. In recent years, the development of national education in Shanghai has been quite rapid, and colleagues in this association have made the most contributions. It was reported that the National Education Cooperative has already distributed goods twice, such as cloth, dried goods, and daily necessities, at extremely low prices, which can be seen as a work to improve the welfare of colleagues. It is hoped that colleagues in the advancement association will participate more.

Du Zuozhou Gives a Speech

Then Dr. Du Zuozhou was introduced to give a speech on the topic of "Why We Need Better Education," briefly stating: In the past century, the educational facilities in our country have not achieved satisfactory results. Elementary education has failed to cultivate children to be good citizens, and it is also a major question whether secondary education can cultivate healthy and excellent young people. Universities are limited by equipment, faculty, and other factors, and have not been able to develop. Therefore, colleagues in the education community should deeply reflect and strive to improve. The future development of national education should have the following conditions: (1) cultivate good habits, (2) pay attention to practical life, (3) cultivate a love of learning, and (4) strengthen physical fitness. To achieve this goal, it is necessary to expand the quantity and improve the equipment on the one hand, and to stabilize the lives of people in the education community on the other hand, so that education can exert its great effect.

Director Gu Gives a Speech

After Secretary Xu of the Municipal Party Department delivered instructions, Director Gu gave a speech: briefly stating that he believes that education is the most important during the nation-building period, and that teaching is the most important. The development of national education in Shanghai owes much to the assistance of enthusiastic people in the community, and on the other hand, we must also thank the efforts of the teachers. He then reported that among the 300-plus private schools that collected tuition fees this time, only 20-plus schools exceeded the standard, and he hopes that they will return the fees immediately. He understands that the lives of private school teachers and staff are difficult and has submitted a request to the mayor to allocate low-priced rice to private school colleagues. As for the finances of private schools, he hopes that they will be completely transparent and reasonably allocated. As for the academic advancement fees for teachers in municipal schools, the Municipal Council has approved them and included them in the budget, and teachers in both urban and rural areas can receive subsidies. This can show that the councilors represent public opinion, and it is hoped that teachers can work with peace of mind. Although the number is not large, the significance is very profound. After the speeches, there were many entertainment programs. It did not adjourn until 1:00 PM.

### The Gymnasium is Packed; China United Wins Again Against Columbus

42-47 China United, under the Command of Da Li, Wins by Five Points; Excellent Performance Defeats American Soldiers

[Report from our Newspaper] The Municipal Gymnasium was packed last night, with a grand scene no less impressive than when the Qunsheng Troupe came to Shanghai. In the second major battle between China United and the U.S. Navy's Columbus, China United once again defeated the American team by five points, 47-42, with the first half score at 34-14. In the second half, Columbus launched a fierce counterattack, fighting more and more bravely. The American team scored 28 points, while China United scored only 13, making it a narrow victory. If the American team had not lost so many points in the first half, they might have caught up. However, China United's performance was indeed very hardworking and excellent. China United's basketball skills have greatly improved. Wu Chengzhang "flew all over the court," capable of both defense and offense, and can be called one of the most contributing members last night. Lao Bao's one-handed shots were extremely accurate, and Da Li's command of the team was indispensable. Xue Chong's teamwork was effective, and they worked together to defend with all their strength. Although Liang Xiong came on the court last, he made outstanding contributions. It was quite difficult to fight against their eight-person rotation with only six players.

China United Team: Elated

Li Zhenzhong made a basket outside the free-throw line. With a flick from Zhenzhong, Wu Chengzhang cut in and scored again. Bao Songyuan scored the third basket, and China United immediately went up by six points, with impressive momentum. Xie Fang committed a foul, and Li Shi'ai missed his free throw, scoring one point.

Chengzhang made a risky save under the basket and passed it far to Songguo, who used a feint to deceive the American soldier and scored with a one-handed shot. The movement was clear, 18-9. China United maintained its lead all the way, with cheers erupting. At this time, the American sailors made a major adjustment to their lineup, "exchanging tall players for tall players," but they still could not stop China United's advance. Songyuan, Ai Xu, Chengzhang, and Bruce all made contributions, 23-14. In the first half, China United was elated.

Columbus: Slightly Inferior

Bruce, Ai Xu, Cooper, Bai Na-tuo, and Bruce constituted the starting lineup for the second half, the same as at the beginning of the first half. Bruce often broke through from the right, easily scoring two baskets. Zhenzhong's two shots under the basket were both wasted due to incorrect angles, but with a rebound, he passed the ball to Xuechong, who scored, making up for the mistake. Chengzhang then scored again, and Bruce broke in, making it 28-20. Zhenzhong made a shot and a free throw, both hitting the target, 31-22, still nine points behind. Te Lin-hua replaced Bai Laofu, and China United called its third timeout. Li Zhenzhong's shot hit the basket support. Ai Xu jumped up, with his hand higher than the basket ring. The American team advanced directly in a rapid chase, with Ai Xu and Bruce scoring, 33-28, closing in, only five points behind. Songyuan and Bruce then showed their colors, still five points behind. Li committed a foul, but Bruce was too nervous and missed both free throws, resulting in no points. The situation showed tension. Xuechong and Ai Xu each scored (38-32). Bao made a temporary shot, the opponent fouled, the ball went in, and another free throw was made, adding three points, 41-34. Ren Xiangcheng fouled out and was replaced by Zhang Liangxiong, who immediately recorded two points on the credit book within 30 seconds. Li Zhenzhong and Bruce fought back and forth, 45-40, with only three minutes left. Zhang Jian made his second contribution, 47-42. China United called its fourth timeout, 47-42. Ai Xu fouled out and Cross was brought in, 47-42. In the end, China United won by only five points.

### Five Thousand Spectators Amazed; Green Team Triumphs in the Capital, Narrowly Defeating Lizhi Team; Mingyuan and Zhenbao's Performance is Wonderful

[Report from our Newspaper, Nanjing, 9th] The Green Team, which won this year's Shanghai Women's Basketball League Championship, made its debut in Beijing on the 9th, immediately overwhelming the capital's strong team, Lizhi, by a score of 17 to 13. The beauty of their passing and the strength of their defense left a deep impression on the 5,000 spectators in the audience. The wonderful performances of Huang Mingyuan and Liu Zhenbao were particularly breathtaking.

Lizhi Leads by One Point

The game started at around 3:20 PM. The Green Team players were Huang Mingyuan, Rong Shujian, Li Yunzhi, Liu Zhenbao, Wang Weizhen, Wu Ailian, and Wu Meiying. The Lizhi Team countered with their most elite players, Chen Baixue, Chen Jinchai, Liu Shouguang, and others. The referee was Wen Zongyuan. Lizhi had the advantage of home court, and the Green Team was not used to outdoor play. Lizhi opened the scoring first. Mingyuan and others launched several counterattacks, but due to their eagerness to win, they failed to score. Soon after, Lizhi scored again. The Green Team's formation saw enemy cavalry running rampant, and the situation appeared critical. Fortunately, Mingyuan scored a basket from the midst of the enemies, breaking the egg. In the first quarter, Lizhi led 4-2. With the gong sounding again, the Green Team launched a full-scale attack. Zhenbao missed a free throw, and Mingyuan's shot missed. The Lizhi players returned again and shot at the basket as many as eleven times in two minutes, finally managing to score one basket. The scoreboard showed 6-2. The Green Team hurriedly called a timeout to discuss strategy. With the battle cry sounding again, the Green Team's forwards fought bravely, with repeated beautiful passes. Mingyuan made a free throw, and the situation improved slightly. Mingyuan then made another free throw, resulting in a 6-6 tie. The first half ended, with the Lizhi team leading by one point, 7-6.

Green Team Soars

The second half began, and the overall situation was still under the control of the opponent. However, the Shanghai players were ultimately experienced and capable of fighting. Numbers 3 and 9 shuttled across the Lizhi territory, resulting in a 9-9 tie. The score then soared upwards. Mingyuan's accurate shooting posed a great threat to the opponent, leveling the score into an absolute advantage of 15-9. Although Lizhi frequently substituted players, the overall trend was irreversible. At this time, the Shanghai team players did their best to demonstrate their new-style tactics such as blocking, dazzling the Lizhi players. In the end, the visiting team won 17-13. To award merit, Mingyuan scored ten points alone and deserved the greatest credit. Zhenbao did not seem to be in her best condition. It is heard that the Green Team still has games in Beijing, but due to vacation schedules, the team decided to return to Shanghai by overnight express train on Monday.

### Basketball Notes

In the basketball friendly match between China United and Columbus, the Municipal Gymnasium was packed last night, no less than when the Qunsheng Troupe came to Shanghai.

China United fielded Da Li, A-Di, Xuechong, Lao Bao, and Xiangcheng, which is their strongest lineup. Although Xiangcheng is not good at shooting, his long and short passes are well-timed. China United's performance was therefore more active, and they defeated Columbus again.

Da Li remains a leading figure, finding gaps and passing quickly, allowing Xuechong, A-Di, and Lao Bao to score. A-Di and Lao Bao are currently in top form. Lao Bao's interceptions and A-Di's steals are admirable, and Xuechong's skills under the basket are gradually returning to their former level.

Columbus's biggest weakness is their lack of technique in passing, often being intercepted by China United. Their shooting skills have also not reached a good level. Only the right guard, Cooper, can dribble and shoot well, and the center, Bai Laofu, is barely satisfactory.

In the first half, China United held an absolute advantage, leading 18-7 and 23-12. In the second half, with the score at 41-34, Ren Xiangcheng fouled out for the fifth time, and Zhang Liangxiong came on as a substitute, immediately showing his long-range shooting ability.

Li Zhenzhong showed signs of fatigue ten minutes before the end of the game, probably due to overexertion in recent days.

Based on last night's lineup and performance, China United can defeat the combined Navy, Army, and Youth team by three goals. (Chang Nian)

### Donghua Maintains Perfect Record with Ninth Consecutive Victory, Defeats Soviet Team Again

Long Hai and Youliang Each Score a Goal in the Second Half

[Report from our Newspaper] Donghua continued to maintain its winning streak, defeating the Soviet team again yesterday, creating a glorious record of nine wins in nine games in the A Division. In the first half, the Soviet team resisted strongly, and neither side scored. In the second half, Long Hai and Youliang each scored a goal, securing the victory. Yesterday, there were over 8,000 fans at the Yiyuan Stadium, and the atmosphere was quite lively. The lineups of both sides are recorded below:

Donghua

Zhang Banglun, Zhuang Youren, Zhang Lingen, Han Longbo, Xin Fuzhen, Lin Wenhua (Down), Yu Qiaxing (Up), Li Yao, Sun Jinshun, Han Longhai, Chen Mingzhe (Up), Yu Qiaxing (Down), Jia Youliang

Soviet Union

Bao Saiweiqu, Kaloliequ, Gutofu, Shaleining, Jielinggufu, Tiefu Ninogolofu, Gelinasi, Laobusi Tuofu, Quebi Gufu, Bolang (Down), Kapusiting (Up)

Stalemate

Referee Chen Jixiang, linesmen Yue Xiurong and He Chunhui, blew the whistle to start the game. The Soviet team attacked first, with the "Little Yellow Hair" attacking. Fuzhen cut off his path. Gelinasi committed another foul. In Donghua's territory, enemy cavalry ran rampant. The "Little Yellow Hair" missed his shot. Donghua counterattacked, but also without success. After eight minutes, Longhai probed the defense, but was offside. Before long, Jia Youliang cut in from the corner, with a very good landing point. Longhai headed the ball, but unfortunately it was too high. Lao Sun's shot was saved by Bao Saiweiqu. The two sides were at a stalemate for 20 minutes. After 25 minutes, the nephew and uncle Youliang and Mingzhe switched positions. After about five minutes, Mingzhe crossed from the baseline. Jinshun's "iron leg" failed, and the ball bounced off Gutofu. Near the end of the first half, Jia Youliang and Bian Luoliequ collided, and Youliang was injured. The first half ended, with neither side scoring, 0-0.

Two Consecutive Goals

Changing sides and resuming the battle, the Donghua forwards advanced, attacking relentlessly. After five minutes, Sun Lao Jin crossed the ball, and Longhai lightly flicked the ball into the net from five yards away, 1-0. Donghua opened the scoring. The Soviet team, having lost the first city, launched a full-scale counterattack. Lingen and Youren parried from left and right, handling the situation calmly. After 15 minutes, Sun Lao Jin deployed another brilliant plan. Youliang passed the ball to the right wing, but unfortunately Mingzhe failed to seize the opportunity. After a long melee, the Soviet team was unable to succeed and changed their formation. Gelinasi was transferred to right inside forward, Quebi Gufu to right wing, and Kapusiting changed to left inside forward. This proved to be effective. However, the Donghua defenders defended tightly, without any mistakes. After 31 minutes, Kapusiting was injured and left the field, replaced by Bolang. Donghua took advantage of the opportunity to enter. Jinshun pounded hard, bounced back off Gutofu, and Youliang hooked back, sending the ball into the net again, making it 2-0. At this time, Lin Wenhua replaced Chen Mingzhe, but before long the game ended and the whistle blew. Donghua defeated the Soviet team again, winning 2-0 and creating a great achievement of nine wins in nine games.

### Opinions on the Chain System Provided by Ye Xuxin, Director of the Importers and Exporters Association, Suggesting the Establishment of a Foreign Exchange Review Committee for Imports and Exports

[Our Newspaper] Recently, the chain system for imports and exports has been strongly promoted in the city's import and export circles. Yesterday, Ye Xuxin, Director of the Importers and Exporters Association, provided a written opinion on the implementation of the import and export chain system, stating that the business of Chinese import and export companies is currently on the verge of collapse. The root cause is that domestic commodity prices are rising daily, exceeding foreign market prices, making it difficult to properly value exported domestic goods. For importers, the government provides very few foreign exchange quotas for legitimate business use, and all foreign exchange applications are often delayed by the authorities for months without any attention. This forces companies to cancel contracts, resulting in considerable losses in telegrams and other expenses. However, the high commodity prices and the lack of foreign exchange quotas are also due to unavoidable difficulties faced by our society and government. Unless the domestic situation is clarified, our businesses will not be able to escape this suffering. Given this reality, during this transitional period, our businesses must find other ways to maintain operations, which is the reason for advocating the chain system. The chain system allows businesses to use the foreign exchange earned from exports for the foreign exchange quotas needed for imports. In other words, the foreign exchange quotas needed for a company's imports and acquired from its exports must offset each other. China has always had a trade deficit, meaning that the foreign exchange quotas needed for imports exceed the foreign exchange earned from exports. If this chain system is adopted, it will indirectly force businesses to reduce imports of non-essential foreign goods, while encouraging people to work hard to expand exports and earn foreign exchange. The benefits of this method for the country and its people cannot be overstated.

However, if this chain system is not properly managed, it could lead to unimaginable problems. First, it could raise the value of foreign exchange domestically, creating a black market for foreign exchange. Because China is a country with a trade deficit, Chinese importers will inevitably compete to collect foreign exchange quotas, perhaps even secretly increasing prices to achieve their purchase desires. This will lead to the emergence of a black market for foreign exchange. Some, eager to obtain foreign exchange to pay for their imported goods, may not hesitate to sell export goods at a reduced value, effectively lowering the price of Chinese goods in foreign markets. In this situation, merchants who engage in both import and export can still survive by using the profits from imported goods to offset the losses from exports. However, those who only engage in exports will be unable to maintain operations, and will either have to shut down completely or resort to mixing inferior goods with the good. Would this not damage the reputation of China's entire presence in foreign markets? Therefore, to achieve good results by implementing this chain system, a thorough management mechanism is necessary. Now, I will briefly offer a few suggestions for reference:

(1) Export goods must be sold at government-set prices. However, these price limits must be based on the market prices at the destination. Exports are not allowed below this price limit. This can prevent importers and exporters from reducing prices to seek sales, which would affect foreign markets. These price limits can be announced by the government at any time based on reports from Chinese commercial officials abroad.

(2) To encourage the export of materials, the government should provide as much convenience as possible in transportation and should provide very low-interest loans.

(3) To maintain China's reputation and prevent merchants from mixing inferior goods with the good, the inspection of goods should be strengthened, and detailed regulations should be established for the grades and standards of exported goods. Experts from each industry should be hired to participate in the inspection work. "Because those outside the industry cannot fully understand the advantages and disadvantages of the industry, and the import and export of materials can also be easily investigated."

If exporters can achieve this goal, it will increase the quantity of exports and obtain more foreign exchange quotas.

(4) The total amount of foreign exchange obtained from exports and distributed for imports should be published in the newspapers every week to strengthen the confidence of businesses and the public.

(5) Except for a certain percentage retained by the government, the rest of the foreign exchange earned from exports can be used by businesses for imports at their request.

(6) A foreign exchange review committee for import and export chain methods should be established. In addition to representatives dispatched by government agencies, the National Federation of Commerce, the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, and the Importers and Exporters Association should also be allowed to send representatives to participate.

### Textile Construction Increases the Amount of Domestically Purchased Cotton

To maintain domestic cotton production and regulate the rural economy, the Textile Construction Company is making every effort to purchase domestic cotton. The company originally planned to purchase 800,000 bales of domestic cotton in this agricultural production year, but as of yesterday, the company's statistics show that it has received 955,000 bales. Because of this they are even more excited. They have ordered staff in Shaanxi, Henan, Hebei and other places to continue to work hard to purchase and are now aiming for a target of 1.2 million bales. The company estimates that it will need 3.75 million bales of cotton this year. In addition to purchasing American cotton, it will be able to blend in one-third of domestic cotton this year. In order to cooperate with national policy and earn foreign exchange, the company, in addition to shipping 2,000 pieces to Hong Kong earlier, has also shipped more than 100 pieces of cotton yarn and 50,000 pieces of cloth to Southeast Asia for sale in order to capture overseas markets, it is said.

### Zhejiang Tea Production Has Not Recovered, Factory and Trade Transactions are Quiet

[Central News Agency, Hangzhou, 9th] Tea is one of the major special products of Zhejiang Province, and the production areas are all over the province. During the war, exports were blocked and production was sharply reduced. To this day, it has not yet recovered. According to the survey and statistics of the Agricultural Improvement Institute, the production and sales situation last year was 274,000 dan, and the total number of domestic and foreign sales was 100,000 zu, a decrease of three-quarters compared with the pre-war period. There are more than 130 tea factories and more than 80 tea companies in the province. At the end of last year's settlement, 19 were at a loss, and more than 50 tea companies had closed down. Currently, due to the fact that the tea market has not yet arrived and due to the current situation, transactions are sparse. Brokers are opening the market. Mao tea big square is 480,000 to 700,000, Qiang is 500,000 to 600,000, Hong Qing is 400,000 to 430,000, Jiang Hong is 300,000, Jing tea Longjing is 80,000 for the best grade per catty, 30,000 for the medium grade, and 8,000 to 10,000 for the inferior grade.

### The Fir Market in Our City is Stable

### The Current State of World Currency Under the Control of the US Dollar – Everyone Hopes to Buy More American Goods, so There are Artificial Official Prices

[United Press, New York, 9th] This issue of "Newsweek" analyzes the world currency situation, stating: Currently, there are three major currency areas: the US dollar, the Soviet ruble, and the British pound. Although the Swiss franc is technically stronger than the US dollar, the US dollar dominates the world because it can be used to purchase American industrial products. The officially set exchange rates of various countries are artificial and very different from free market exchange rates. When the International Monetary Fund was established last December, the officially set exchange rates reported by 22 countries could not truly be accepted at their face value. Because every country hopes to buy American goods as much as possible, they set an artificial official price for their currency. For example, in the New York currency market, the British pound is worth US$2.98, and the Egyptian pound is the same price. The official price is US$4.033 for the British pound and US$4.15 for the Egyptian pound. The official price of the Australian pound is US$3.22, and the actual price is US$2.55. The currencies of other countries are also much lower than the official price. Taking one US dollar as a unit, the official prices and free market prices of various countries' currencies are compared as follows:

Official Price Free Market

Belgian Franc 42.8 58

French Franc 119.107 290

Luxembourg Franc 42.8 90

Indian Rupee 3.3 5

Italian Lira 225 590

Dutch Guilder 2.65 6

Swedish Krona 3.6 4

Norwegian Krone 4.96 6.25

Danish Krone 4.79 7.5

Czech Koruna 50 115

Greek Drachma 4950 6300

Finnish Markka 135.40 400

### Comparison of Silk Industry in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Today

China's silk industry suffered huge losses due to the direct and indirect impact of Japan's violent plunder and military operations during the Anti-Japanese War. The China Silk Company has published a detailed estimate and is currently conducting another investigation into the actual situation. It is reported that the comparative figures for the silk industry in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui today and in the past are roughly as follows: Silk factory units: 135 before the war, 129 now, a decrease of 6. Number of silk reeling machines: 35,481 before the war, 2,35 now, a decrease of 24,246. Number of silk reeling machines that can be started: 30,000 before the war, 11,000 now, a decrease of 90,000. Silk reeling capacity of operating silk reeling machines (dan): 90,000 before the war, 33,000 now, a decrease of 57,000. Number of dan of dried cocoons required as raw materials: 405,000 before the war, 148,500 now, a decrease of 256,500. Number of dan of dried cocoons of raw silk materials: 574,000 before the war, 75,000 currently, a decrease of 499,000. The surplus of cocoon raw materials for silk production before the war was 169,000 (Customs dan), and now there is a shortage of 73,500 (Customs dan), it is said.

### New Initiatives in the Transportation Industry: Establishment of a Marine Repair Department

[Our Newspaper] The Pacific Transportation Enterprise Company in this city was established in early July 1946, initiated by Yang Tongyi, Hu Ruixiang, Gu Yuqi, Gu Yuxiu, Yang Tianling, and others. It was formally established on October 1st. Initially, a transportation department was established, and later a repair shop was added to contract various repairs and vehicle loading projects. In early February of this year, three shallow-water landing craft were purchased, and new electric welding machines were installed to establish a marine repair department, specializing in facilitating the repair of all marine transportation vehicles. It is said that this is an innovation in our country.

### Fuzhou Trade Statistics

[Our Newspaper, Fuzhou, 8th] Fuzhou's trade statistics for February show that exports were over 5.1 billion yuan, a decrease of a evil percentage compared with January, and imports were over 6 billion yuan, an increase of 10% compared with January, resulting in a trade surplus of over 900 million yuan. The main export goods were wood, paper, and shiitake mushrooms, and the main import goods were textiles, cotton yarn, cigarettes, and goods from Jiangsu and Guangdong.

### Japanese Silk Export Statistics

[Reuters, Tokyo, 8th] During the period from August 1945 to December 1946, Japan exported a total of 86,427 bales of raw silk, of which 84,475 bales were exported to the United States, 1,212 bales to the United Kingdom, 700 bales to Australia, and 40 bales to New Zealand. During the same period, Japan exported a total of 900,000 yards of silk goods, of which more than 700,000 yards were exported to the United States.

### MacArthur Headquarters Expands Japanese Textile Capacity

[Reuters, Tokyo, 8th] Allied Supreme Commander MacArthur's headquarters has recommended that the production capacity of Japan's cotton textile industry be expanded to 4 million spindles "as a temporary measure" with the aim of slightly increasing Japan's exports in the coming years. Japan currently has 2.5 million spindles.

### Egypt No Longer Requires Import Licenses for Tea

[Reuters, Cairo, 8th] The Egyptian Ministry of Commerce and Industry has announced that Egypt can now import tea from various countries without import licenses. These imported teas will be sold according to the rationing regulations to supplement the shortage of goods controlled by the bureau. The sales conditions for imported tea have been formulated. The price of tea will be controlled, and the profits of importers, wholesalers, and retailers must not exceed 25% of the cost, including import expenses and tariffs.

### British Representative to Go to the US to Purchase Japanese Cotton Cloth

[Reuters, Manchester, 8th] It is learned that a representative of the British Trade Bureau will soon go to Washington to discuss the final details of the plan for Britain to purchase 50 million yards of Japanese-woven cotton cloth from the United States. The Trade Bureau intends to complete the processing procedures for this cotton cloth in Lancashire and then transport it to countries that supply Britain with food and raw materials. The United States has supplied Japan with a large amount of cotton in recent months to weave cotton cloth. Before the war, Lancashire exported 7 billion yards of cotton cloth annually, of which 50 million yards were exported to Japan. Now, due to reduced production, Britain has to purchase Japanese-woven cotton cloth. People in the textile and transportation industries here have expressed shock at this.

### 1947 US Industrial Outlook

— Special Translation by Our Newspaper

Increased Production Will Lower Prices

The fear that 1947 might be a year of recession has gradually disappeared, and what follows is the new hope that this year will continue to be prosperous. Industrial leaders are devising plans to break production records. At the same time, a belief is emerging that consumers, who have been battered by high prices for many years, can now share in the prosperity of the country. Most economists predict that as a result of increased production, prices will gradually fall.

The activity plans formulated by various industries for this year unanimously express optimism about the increase in production. The steel industry expects to produce 90 million tons of steel this year, with a net profit of US$3 billion. The automobile manufacturing industry has set a goal of manufacturing 5 million cars this year and hopes to exceed this number. According to reliable estimates, the demand for new cars will exceed the supply in the next two or three years.

Due to the 17.6% increase in freight rates, American railroads can increase their income by US$1 million and are currently making huge investments to add new equipment. Appliance manufacturers hope to meet the huge demand this year. The prospects for other industries such as aircraft manufacturing, radio, electricity, oil, gas, chemical raw materials, and building materials are generally optimistic.

Experts predict that if the production plans of various industries can be implemented one by one, then consumers can share the benefits. They predict that the price decline of 1920 will reappear today. That year was also the second year after the war, just like 1947. Prices rose to their peak in the first half of the year and then fell back sharply, gradually decreasing rapidly. By the end of the year, the price of textiles had fallen by half, food had fallen by a quarter, and manufactured goods had fallen by a fifth.

The reason for the price decline at that time was the surge in production and consumers' resistance to high prices, that is, the boycott movement. Now, these two factors are also working towards the same goal. Economists point out that current production is more than double that of 1920. Although most durable goods are still not easy to buy, wholesalers will soon have surplus goods to sell. Examples of production sufficient to meet needs are already common and need not be repeated.

The increase in production alone is already a strong force for leveling prices. If it is supported by consumers' refusal to buy, it will form an unparalleled weapon. At least in the United States, consumer resistance is not an organized movement of the public, but mostly due to the inability to afford it, so its effect is greater. Because a person is unable to buy something, no matter what threats or inducements are used, they will not weaken his resistance. What can persuade him is only to implement price cuts to suit his financial resources. However, whether the industry can proceed smoothly according to the established production plan and cause prices to fall depends largely on whether the labor situation is peaceful. If there is another strike like last year, the situation may be completely different.

The fact that the Republican Party has an advantage in the US Congress is beneficial to production. Because it greatly improves the political situation and will take steps to reduce national expenditures and support commerce.

In addition, the increase in the purchasing power of the American public is another factor that makes the industrial prospects for this year optimistic, because the increase in citizens' purchasing power is sufficient to increase the demand for goods.

The industry hopes that labor-management relations in 1947 will improve. It is generally believed that workers are becoming increasingly disgusted with strikes. At the same time, the public and Congress are expressing indignation at strikes, so strike losses in 1947 are expected to decrease.

On the other hand, although wholesale prices and the cost of living have increased, according to official figures, wholesale prices at the beginning of 1947 rose by 30% compared with last June, and the cost of living rose by 15%, but the general trend is that they will obviously fall back soon. Economists warn that the higher the price, the stronger the reaction before the time when production exceeds demand is about to come, because if the past massive expansion of production is not sold, it will inevitably affect the current production process.

After studying various favorable and unfavorable factors, economists have reached the conclusion that the situation in 1947 is often more favorable than in 1946, with the durable goods industry being more developed than before, and the non-durable goods industry being slightly inferior.

### Increased Production and Export of Tung Oil

— Zhang Bo'an

After eight years of bitter fighting, China's only export material—tung oil—has declined to an unimaginable degree!

After the war, in each tung oil producing area, the tung trees have been frequently cut down. Now, according to estimates, the national annual output only averages about 35% of what it was before the war. In the areas that were occupied, there are even fewer tung trees. In the areas that were not occupied, the Trade Commission's control over unified purchase and sales in those years resulted in an extremely unreasonable suppression of the value of tung oil. Tung farmers could not make a profit. Just when food prices were rising, they cut down tung trees to grow food. After the blockade of the coastline, it was impossible to export. In addition to supplying a small amount of modified gasoline, the only outlet for tung oil was for use as lamp oil fuel in the countryside. There was no way to export, and the price was naturally low, so other vegetable oils could follow other local products in rising prices, while tung oil was plagued by misfortune and could not raise its head.

Before the victory, the Trade Commission purchased and accumulated tung oil. Because the sea route was blocked, tung oil was released. Before the victory, the average price in various places was 30,000 yuan per dan. After the victory, the coastal reserve currency was exchanged at a rate of 200 to 1, and converted into national currency, the numbers suddenly increased. For example, if tung oil is calculated at 30,000 yuan per dan, the price in reserve currency is 60 million yuan. At this time, the price of tung oil on the coast is definitely not 60 million yuan, so the price of tung oil has actually decreased. Last spring, exports showed a revival, and prices also slowly rose. Later, because foreign prices were low and the exchange rate was short, and by the end of last year, smuggling in Guangzhou was rampant, and regular exports were almost impossible. Exporters became semi-unemployed.

In the above process, production has declined to an extreme extent, and exports have also been affected, so that China's great export material has fallen into a tragic situation.

This spring, the transport association has attracted great attention, but the long-standing problem of the past eight years cannot be reversed in a short period of time. Therefore, the promotion of tung oil in foreign markets and the issue of increasing domestic production are urgent tasks.

So how will we increase production in the future? According to the Continental Daily News, it is believed that only by using high prices to attract farmers can we reverse the past passivity and achieve a rapid increase in production (see the Continental Daily News Associated Press telegram on February 20). We also think this method is very good, but now it is impossible to force foreign tung oil prices to plummet and domestic prices to rise without limit.

The only way is to think about reducing costs. Free transportation and low-interest bank mortgage loans are more achievable. Because all state-owned transportation vehicles can be transported free of charge, freight can be reduced a lot. In terms of national income, it can be said that the number is limited, and the mobility of production areas and export coasts will be greatly increased. At the same time, the high freight costs are transferred to Tung Chen, and the price of oil will also increase invisibly.

As for export merchants, they often cannot bear the burden of transportation time and high-interest loans due to the obstructed domestic transportation. If banks can provide low-interest mortgage loans, the future of exports will be very different from the present. First, the interest burden is reduced, and second, the funds will not be held down for years and months in terms of capital turnover, which will have a dual effect on export sales.

Secondly: We need to know that foreign markets are about to increase sharply in their need for Chinese tung oil. The Associated Press has also explained this point, "According to tung oil experts, the quality of Chinese tung oil is better than other industrial oils. It is a pity that China's oil refining methods are too outdated. If foreign scientific oil refining methods can be applied, production costs can be reduced and the oil quality can be improved." The industry has collected a lot of information on foreign tung oil substitutes, but in one sentence: Tung oil is tung oil. Due to the relationship between soil and trade, the quality of Chinese tung oil is superior to any substitute. The absorption of gas by Chinese tung oil is stronger than any drying oil, so the export prospects of tung oil are not bleak. On the contrary, in the future, we should greatly increase production from the two points of refining methods; the foreign tung oil market will re-enter our hands. The China Plant Oil Factory should be responsible for improving quality, and local governments should also include increased production movements as part of their consideration.

Last year's tung oil exports were 45,000,000 pounds, compared with the average of 209,100,000 pounds in the 25th and 26th years, accounting for only one-fifth. However, according to estimates from some sources, exports will not exceed 65 million pounds within two years. If this is the case, it is enough to discourage us. We think that the competition for time and space depends on human effort. If the authorities do not catch up quickly, then this large amount of foreign exchange will be abandoned invisibly. And it will not be easy to compete for foreign markets in the future. The above method is an easy way to do it, and I hope the authorities will consider adopting it.

### Divorce City

In a democratic country, one can see "innovative" individuals, innovative enterprises, and even innovative cities everywhere. Reno, a small city that "started with divorce," lies quietly in a corner of the Rocky Mountains in Nevada.

I visited Reno on my way back from a trip to California. In that strange little city, I lingered for four days with curious eyes. According to the people of Reno themselves, they live in the largest small city in the world. As travelers step out of the train station and walk towards the intersection of the main street, they can see a magnificent archway with a large slogan written on it: "The Biggest Little City in the World." At night, the archway is fully decorated with colorful electric lights, and the train can be seen from dozens of kilometers away.

Reno, the Holy City, is like Diamond Earrings

In reality, the city of Reno is not too small. According to the Reno population statistics of July 1st last year, the city has about 30,000 people, with about 5,000 people living in the suburbs. If we consider "Washoe County," which is centered on Reno, the total number is 45,000 people, which is not small compared to other small cities in the United States. What I find most rare is that Reno's man-made and natural environments are completely mismatched. To put it simply, it is like a beggar woman with tattered clothes wearing two diamond earrings. The poverty and desolation of the entire state of Nevada is like a ragged beggar woman, and Reno and "Las Vegas" are the two diamond earrings of Nevada.

I didn't have time to go to "Las Vegas," which is close to Los Angeles and the world-famous "Boulder" dam. American friends in Nevada told me that Las Vegas is exactly the same as Reno, and it is a city that started its business in the same way, by "divorce." They said, "Reno is the boss, Las Vegas is the second child!"

A Courthouse is a Divorce Factory

"Washoe County" has a marble courthouse in Reno, which is the divorce factory of the United States, no, the entire world. According to the constitution of the American federal system, all forty-eight states have the right to enact their own civil and criminal laws (but they must not conflict with the constitution). Nevada's civil law regarding divorce and marriage is particularly "lenient," which is called the most Weak in American customs. Nevada's criminal law has no prohibited regulations except for prostitution and obscene performances. Gambling is public and fully encouraged by the local government. (Note: The author of this article will introduce Nevada's casinos in another article soon.)

Quick and Decisive, Marriage and Divorce are Simple

In Nevada, getting married only requires filling out a very simple form, paying a two-dollar certificate fee, and asking a pastor to officiate the wedding, and the problem is completely solved. Any family background investigation is completely waived. Divorce is slightly more complicated than marriage, but it is incomparable to any other state in the United States or any other country in the world. On my second day in Reno, I visited Mr. Bismore, the director of the public relations department of the Washoe County Courthouse. He said: Nevada only had formal laws at the end of the 19th century. In 1904, Nevada's divorce law stipulated the principle of "quick and decisive," which was quite sympathetic to citizens of other states in the United States, because although the United States is a country of free marriage, divorce is still a painful thing. In California, it usually takes at least a year from trial to judgment for a divorce case. In New York and Pennsylvania, it can even drag on for five years. The torture and pain suffered by both men and women are extremely severe. Therefore, "since Nevada stipulated quick and decisive procedures, many people have taken the train to Reno specifically to file for divorce."

Divorce Applications Adopt a Six-Week System

Because of this environmental need, in order to facilitate out-of-state residents to apply for divorce, the state legislature enacted a new law in 1911, stipulating that non-Nevada citizens must reside in Nevada for one year before they have the right to apply for divorce; in 1913, it was changed to "residing for six months"; in 1930, it was changed to "three months." Starting in May 1931, it was changed to "residing for six weeks." From that year on, the number of divorces increased sharply. In April 1931, the Washoe Court concluded only 174 divorce cases, which increased sharply to 524 cases in May. From May 1931 to the present, the so-called "six-week" system has been used, and there has been no change in between.

Each Brings a Lover, Men and Women Have a Tacit Understanding

Generally, people who come to Reno to go through divorce procedures are from the upper-middle class of American society. Most of these couples have a tacit understanding of divorce before they set off, and most of them bring their lovers, future prospective husbands or prospective wives, to Reno. Six weeks of leisurely "residence" forces them to bring a lot of gold and silver to spend and enjoy here. In this way, the desolate city on the desert prairie is nourished and prospered. Large-scale casinos are open 24 hours a day, seven days a week. None of Reno's seventy-two hotels are not brightly lit and full of guests every day. The rent for a room at the "Riverside Hotel" is twenty US dollars a day, and even if you send a telegram in advance, you cannot "do it." The boss took a bunch of telegram papers and asked me to forgive him with a sad face: "So many people want to book rooms, only people move in, no one moves out, what can I do?"

Divorced Women Kiss Marble Pillars? Throw Wedding Rings into the River?

The Riverside Hotel is adjacent to the Reno River on the left and the County Courthouse on the right. There is a legend in Reno that women who have been divorced must kiss the four marble pillars at the entrance of the courthouse once the court ruling comes out, and they must throw their wedding diamond rings into the river. A certain American movie even filmed many street urchins with bare thighs touching diamond rings at the bottom of the river. In the Reno Public Library, I saw a book that called these stories "shameless lies." It said: Reno has never had these things. Since you are divorced, what rituals are you talking about?

Early in the morning, I lingered on the river bank for a long time. It was a thin stream of "clear spring gravel" like the Huansha Creek. Perhaps, how many people have shed tears here? How many people have laughed wildly here? In the courthouse, I heard two divorce cases. One was a divorced woman named Jenny from Washington State, about thirty-five years old, who had two children. She had been married for five years and is now applying for divorce. The man did not appear in court and hired a lawyer to represent him. The woman did not solemnly state the reasons for the divorce, and the man's lawyer did not express any objection. The judge's inquiry focused on the six-week residency: the day of arrival, the hotel where she stayed, and the hotel to which she moved. Did she leave Nevada in between? Then, the judge examined the statistical table and the proof of residency dates, and then ruled "Divorce granted."

This is not the judge's negligence. The judge himself is only executing the law. The law has no provisions for disallowing divorce, but you must reside continuously for six weeks. If there is one day in between that the applicant does not leave Nevada, then the application is equivalent to waste paper and completely invalid.

Divorce Granted in About Five Minutes Each

Bismore said: There are only two judges in the court, and the average time for hearing a divorce case is five minutes each. The court is not sloppy because of the five minutes. The court is still dignified and solemn. The judge's "robes," the female clerk's roll call, and the lawyers' advances and retreats are not ambiguous at all. In order to save time, it proceeds very tightly. Bismore said: This is entirely a matter of fact. Last year (1946), the Reno Court concluded a total of 11,175 divorce cases.

If we take months as the unit, the highest record was in December 1945, reaching 1,169 cases. That was after the Japanese surrender, when officers and soldiers returned home after being discharged from the army. The separation and reunion of men and women in troubled times created these tragic records. The lowest was in January 1941, with only 115 cases. That was after the Pearl Harbor Incident, when young men enthusiastically joined the army. "How can we make a home before the Huns are destroyed?" Naturally, there was no talk of divorce!

Marriage Takes Effect Immediately Two Hours After Divorce

A frightening number? I looked at the statistics Bismore gave me and couldn't help but feel horrified. But he smiled and said, "There's more, please look at the marriage figures! They are much more than the divorce figures!"

Getting married in Reno is freer than anywhere else. The law stipulates that marriage takes effect immediately two hours after divorce. Many divorced men and women turn from one couple into two couples in a short two hours. Last year, 29,104 couples got married in Reno, which is equivalent to two and a half times the number of divorces. Of course, there are also many real "new" grooms and "new" brides. The most interesting thing is the various forms in the court registration office. There are twenty-six "non-stop writing" staff working there all day long. At the entrance of the registration office, there is a counter with large books, and two kind old ladies are there to accept registrations. On the counter are "Summary of Nevada Divorce Law" and "Nevada Marriage Guide," many well-bound booklets, given to applicants for reference.

Open and Aboveboard, Pastors Also Advertise

I saw a not-so-"new" groom and bride paying two US dollars to apply for a marriage certificate. The man looked like a retired army officer. They were both from Oakland, across the river from San Francisco. The clerk told them that the certificate must have a pastor or judge as a witness, and it will only take effect after the witness signs. The clerk also told them that Reno only has two judges hearing cases, and they are very busy. It is best to find a pastor to officiate the wedding. She pointed to the wall opposite the counter, where there were more than thirty magnificent pastors' advertisements.

It was the first time I had seen pastors with advertisements. They printed very elaborate cards, explaining the different churches and the different experiences of each person.

Collecting Wedding Fees to Donate to the Church

That afternoon, I visited Pastor H. of the Methodist Church. There were gold letters written on the glass door of his office, like a trading company's "signboard." Inside, there were several rows of men and women waiting for him to officiate the wedding. Pastor H. took the time to meet me in the midst of his busy schedule and talked to me a lot about the religious principles of marriage for men and women. He said: "People all over the world think that Reno is a purely evil city, but few people understand that the number of people getting married in Reno every year is more than the number of divorces."

I asked Pastor H. two questions: First, how much do you charge each time you officiate a wedding? Second, what kind of teaching and comfort do you give to those who come to get married two hours after their divorce? Pastor H. was very unhappy, as if he thought my questions were too blunt. However, pastors are all well-mannered. He said: Many other churches charge very high wedding fees, which is not right. The Methodist Church does not charge fees, and they are free to donate. Each time it ranges from five to twenty yuan, and the donations are all used for the church. Second, although there are indeed people who come to get married immediately after a divorce, there are very few after all. Most of the weddings he officiates are for real grooms and brides.

Pastor H. said that he had officiated a wedding for a Chinese couple, but they were not Christians. He said: "The only requirement for me to officiate a wedding is to persuade them to believe in Christianity."

There are very few Chinese men and women in Reno, and even fewer who get divorced in Reno, but there are also some, but it is not a real divorce like Westerners, but for other (?) reasons.

An old overseas Chinese leader surnamed Guan introduced me to interview a lawyer named John Davidson in a majestic high-rise building with very elegant furnishings. Lawyer Davidson has been in Reno for seventeen years and has handled thousands of divorce cases. He has handled cases for citizens of all forty-eight states in the United States, as well as for overseas Chinese. He has also handled cases for people from England, Australia, and Canada. He was flipping through a Canadian divorce file and said, "This is a rather troublesome case!"

Unilateral Divorce Procedures are Not Complete

Curiosity prompted me to ask him many difficult legal questions. For example, I said: "I have a friend in New York whose relationship with his wife is not good. The husband wants to come to Nevada to get a divorce, but the wife is quite conservative and would rather die than accept the divorce conditions. May I ask, what can that gentleman do? If the husband comes here and divorces unilaterally, will it take effect?"

Lawyer Davidson was surprised and said: "This is your Chinese situation. Americans don't do this. If a husband doesn't love her and the couple can't live together, why must they keep the name of the couple?" Then he added: Nevada's divorce law must be recognized by each state separately before it can take effect in each state separately. New York State hates Nevada's divorce the most. If the husband obtains a unilaterally approved divorce here, if he returns to New York and remarries, the original wife can sue in the New York court. If he does not return to live in New York State, his unilateral divorce still has a legal basis. However, in any case, the Nevada court must transfer this case to New York, and it will only be truly completed legally after the original wife living in New York signs and agrees."

The lawyer said: In the United States, there is no such thing as "I would rather die than get a divorce." The establishment of a marital relationship depends on the emotional connection between the two parties. Since one party has no emotion at all, the other party at most asks for some material compensation. Therefore, he believes that Nevada's law is not only reasonable, but also in line with human nature. He said: Many British and Canadian people come to Reno to get divorced, and at first their spouses are quite unwilling. However, since one party is determined to come to Reno, the other party has only one way to negotiate and demand compensation.

He also said: "If your hypothetical friend in New York comes to Reno to go through unilateral divorce procedures, and if he resides in Nevada for a long time after the procedures are completed, then even if the other party does not agree, there is nothing that can be done."

According to Lawyer Davidson's experience: American divorce cases rarely have such huge alimony fees as in China, unless the man gives it voluntarily, and the court rarely awards alimony, and even if there is, it is extremely small.

He said that although Nevada's law opens a convenient door for divorce, the law pays great attention to protecting infants, because "infants are the seedlings of the people, and we cannot harm them." He also said: Divorced parents, if the mother does not agree, the father cannot forcibly take the infant. The divorced father should be fully responsible for the infant's education and upbringing. "The so-called alimony is mostly for the infant, not for the abandoned wife." Lawyer Davidson spoke eloquently and became more and more energetic! "The abandoned wife has the ability to survive, she can remarry and be a bride again, why should she be supported?"

It is not easy for an Oriental to observe Western society. I suddenly thought of Wu Fangji's "Wanrong Ci" and the "one step, one look back" lament of the abandoned wife, and I really had endless feelings of vicissitudes!

### A Panoramic View of Keelung Harbor

— Keelung Shipping News on the 8th, by Our Taiwan Correspondent Yang Yu

The island of Taiwan, surrounded by water on all sides, has a coastline extending 398 miles. There are as many as seventy-seven large and small islands nearby, with a winding coastline that makes it very inconvenient for ships to enter and exit. Many rivers are either torrentially swift or prone to flooding. Combined with the influence of summer low-pressure systems and winter seasonal winds, Taiwan's fisheries have always been constrained by these natural conditions, preventing them from developing. After the Japanese occupied the area, they placed emphasis on this work. In the seventh year of the Taisho era (1918), they established a fisheries section under the Taiwan Governor-General's Office, starting with Keelung as the center and engaging in sailing boat fishing. This can be said to be the beginning of planned fishing in Taiwan. In May of the ninth year of the Showa era (1934), they further invested 830,000 Japanese yen to build an excellent fishing port in Keelung. The water surface is wide and about five meters deep, which can accommodate about 400 fishing boats. On land, they also built a marine products hall, a fish market, a coral market, a fisheries radio station, warehouses, residences, a freezing factory, an ice-making factory, a marine products training center, and all other necessary facilities for a fishing port. Although fishing ports were also built in Kaohsiung, Suao, Hualien Harbor, Xinyi Port, Magong, and other places, they were not as perfect as Keelung.

The Japanese attached great importance to the marine products trade in Taiwan Province. They themselves admitted that the domestic political situation and economic conditions in China were barometers of the marine products trade. In order to compete for the market, they had to concentrate all their strength. Therefore, in the past, Taiwanese were excluded from all departments of the province's marine products industry, except for doing some menial labor. Speaking of marine products, the most serious problem now is still the talent shortage. The Japanese have all been repatriated, and it is almost impossible to immediately replenish personnel to even maintain a barely acceptable level of operations.

Marine Products School Cultivates 200 Cadres

Keelung Harbor is forever hidden in the misty drizzle. The first time I admired its true appearance, the impression I got was one of dilapidation and haggardness. From the rickshaw, I could see endless ruins of buildings, collapsed and piled everywhere. Nearly forty large-scale bombings have caused too much damage.

The Marine Products Hall in Hamacho was once the headquarters for the Japanese to operate the Keelung fishing port, but now the doors are tightly closed, and it squats quietly by the sea without any vitality. I looked inside through the cracks in the door, and it was full of dust and dark like a tangerine box. I heard that it was taken over by the navy, but in fact, it is not being used now. Further north, after walking quite a few mountain roads up and down, I saw the Marine Products Vocational School revealed from behind a stone tablet with the words "Imperial Road Clear and Smooth."

The predecessor of this provincial marine products vocational school was the Marine Products Training Center of the Taiwan Governor-General's Office, established in 1943. The school buildings had not been completely completed, and the newly built workshops were destroyed by bombs. As a result, when the marine products school took over in December of the year before last, it only received two buildings and three bungalows. In the past, the training center was organized as a secondary school, but only had a junior high school section. After the restoration, a senior high school class was added. More than 200 students are allocated to this small number of rooms, which is really too cramped. Senior high school first graders are now divided into three classes: aquaculture, manufacturing, and fishing. Although the junior high school is not divided according to the instructions of the education authorities, in addition to general subjects, it also first teaches the basic common sense of marine products business. Among these three classes, the most emphasis is placed on fishing, followed by manufacturing. Only four students are currently enrolled in the aquaculture class. Important courses include swimming, boating, fishing gear science, manufacturing methods, aquaculture methods, marine products, meteorology, driving, marine product processing, fishing overview, fishing gear manufacturing, and marine biology. On average, there are about 40 hours of classes per week, which is quite demanding. However, barefoot students trek from various places by train and bus every day, rain or shine. This spirit of hard work and endurance is very commendable.

Because the pay is relatively low, it is not easy to hire teachers. At the same time, there are too few books on marine products business in the country. Here, they can only compile their own teaching materials and issue handouts, but due to limited funding, they cannot print many copies. The most common panic about people and books in Taiwan's education circles is even more evident here.

The fishing boat used for fishing department students' practice is now only the "Tai Whale" No. 140-ton Zhenke. Although there are hand nets, trawl nets, and other fishing gear, there are not many. The manufacturing department's workshop is currently being repaired, and it will probably take more than ten days to start work. Here, they are also prepared to process and manufacture fish food and canned goods themselves. The school authorities plan to expand the school buildings, renovate the auditorium, and add practice boats and fishing gear this year, with a budget of more than 20 million Taiwan dollars. Although it is not yet known how much will be obtained, everyone hopes that this school can occupy an important position in Taiwan's marine products business.

According to reports, the authorities recently prepared to set up a national marine products vocational school in the country. In Taiwan Province, in addition to this marine products school, there is also a Kaohsiung branch and a Penghu marine school. It is hoped that they can be linked up in the future and work together to promote and develop our country's marine products expertise.

Stinky Refrigeration Factory Produces 45 Tons of Ice Daily

The original site of the Keelung Hamacho branch of the South Japan Fisheries Company, which was very important in Japan, now has the signboard of the "Taiwan Marine Products Co., Ltd. Keelung Branch" erected. This company used to be very large, owning 200 fishing boats and building freezing factories and processing factories. However, by the end of the war, on the one hand, it was bombed, and on the other hand, because the Japanese occupied Hong Kong, the Philippines, and Hainan Island, they moved their focus to Kaohsiung, so it also declined for a while. But now it has returned to its former state, and the sound of motors has begun to sound again on this quiet seaside.

The processing factory was too badly damaged and cannot be used. It has now been converted into office space. Currently, the company's main business is fishing and ice making. Some of the original 200 fishing boats were turned into military use during the war, and some were sunk by bombing. After receiving them and sorting them out, about twenty or thirty can be used, and they have already been dispatched to sea to fish in batches. On average, a pair of fishing boats goes to sea twice a month and can harvest about 4,000 boxes of fish (36 pounds per box). Among them, the most common are sea bream and red sea bream distributed in the East China Sea and the Taiwan Strait. After being transported back, they are sold to fish markets everywhere. Because the demand is strong, the company often feels that the amount of fish caught is not enough to distribute. This can only be greatly supplied when the number of fishing boats increases in the future.

Factory Director Liu of the freezing factory led reporters on a tour of the factory. The freezing factory originally had three parts: refrigeration, processing, and ice making. The cold storage is still in its original state, with a total of fifteen rooms. The temperature is mostly below four degrees Celsius, and refrigerated fish can be maintained for one week to ten days. As mentioned earlier, the processing part has been converted into an office and has stopped operating. The ice-making factory could produce 135 tons per day during the Japanese era, but after the takeover, it was shut down until October of last year due to the need to repair the machines and the shortage of ammonia, the raw material for ice making. Now the company has established a factory that uses ryamine to manufacture ammonia, and has also purchased a lot of American ammonia. However, because there are too few fishing boats, the demand is greatly reduced. Now it can manufacture 45 tons of water per day. In addition to supplying fishing boats and selling to the public, there is still a surplus.

On a 400-horsepower compressor, thick ice has formed. After continuous compression, the ammonia is transported through countless pipes to every part that needs it. Everywhere here, you can smell a pungent odor. We also ducked our heads and drilled into the water-making room, which was so cold that it made people shudder. Rows of empty cylinders were hoisted by cranes to the bottom of the water pipes, filled with filtered seawater, and then placed in deep pits of calcium chloride water. Countless pipes with ammonia running through them began to absorb its heat. Usually, it only takes 24 hours to form a thick block of water.

Visiting the Marine Products Experiment Station on Sheliao Island

From the shore, I hired a small rowboat and crossed the green waters of the fishing port to the front of the Marine Products Experiment Station on Sheliao Island on the north shore. A few sparse tropical palm trees swayed forlornly in the slanting wind and fine rain. Director Li of the station went to Taipei on official business. Section Chief Zeng of the General Affairs Section received the reporter and told me in detail about the past history of this experiment station.

This used to be the Marine Products Experiment Station of the Taiwan Governor-General's Office. In the past, the Japanese paid attention to both production and research, so many industrial, agricultural, forestry, and other industrial parts of Taiwan could be handled in an orderly manner. This is really a big reason. The Marine Products Experiment Station was initially divided into four departments: fishing, oceanography, processing, and aquaculture. In addition to engaging in technical fishing, the main work of "fishing" was to explore fishing grounds, investigate fish species, and then notify various fishing companies to catch them based on their clues. The "oceanography" aspect focused on the examination and measurement of tides, water temperature, seabed geology, etc. "Processing" was to take marine products to study quality and improve manufacturing. In the past, the Marine Products Experiment Station built many fishing boats. Among them, one ship, the Zhaonan Maru, weighed 418 tons and was well-equipped. It can be said to be the only fishing boat in East Asia that can simultaneously carry out fishing, oceanography, and processing work. It has now been received by Daoli in Kaohsiung and is being repaired intensively. The Marine Products Experiment Station has high expectations for it and believes that in the near future, it will exert excellent functions for the combined marine products business of Taiwan.

The buildings of the Marine Products Experiment Station were destroyed in the war, leaving only a section of short walls. After receiving them on December 21st of the year before last, it was not until May of last year that the office and workshop were hastily repaired. While sorting out the books retrieved from the fire and past reports, they searched for machinery scattered in various places. In September, they barely started working, continuing to follow the previous policy. It is expected that in the second half of this year, they may be able to contribute a little to fishing due to the completion of the replenishment of fishing boats. Due to the lack of equipment in oceanographic surveying, it is feared that the expected goal cannot be achieved. Currently, they can only use some simple instruments left by the Japanese to measure tides, water temperature, and the specific gravity of water once a day near the Bachi Gate in the fishing port. Currently, only a small amount of agar-agar can be manufactured in the processing field, but it is planned to manufacture canned goods and other fish foods within this year.

According to statistics, the chance of fish eggs being fertilized during spawning in the waves is only about 4%. Recently, technicians from here and personnel from the Department of Agriculture and Forestry conducted artificial incubation experiments in Gongguan, Taipei. As a result, more than 99% of the fish eggs can be hatched into small fish, and the satisfactory result of aquaculture experiments has been obtained. At the same time, this is also studying a work that the Japanese had not completed before, that is, how to add less caprylic acid preservative added to canned goods and still maintain its durability without changing quality and without affecting human health, because ordinary preservatives will have harmful effects on human body.

The Marine Products Experiment Station has a branch in Hualien Harbor, which specializes in aquaculture and has been very successful in the past, but the typhoon last year damaged the levee and caused a lot of losses, which is now being repaired. It is also planned to set up a branch in Kaohsiung to engage in the industrial research of fish skin tanning.

The three institutions in Keelung Harbor, which are growing up in suffering, are all trying to maintain themselves in simplicity, but simply maintaining is not enough. How to develop and expand in the future is a matter worthy of attention. Especially in China, where the marine products business has always been backward, it seems that it should be at this time to use the existing foundation to build some achievements, and we must not be shortsighted or follow the old ways.

### Swiftly Stabilizing the Great Southwest: Zhang Qun Going Back and Forth Between Nanjing and Sichuan

— Chongqing Dispatch by Air on the 2nd, by Xiao Jin

Three Weeks of Dynamics Worth Noting

Since Zhang Qun went to the United States for medical treatment, and Deng Xihou acted as the chairman of Sichuan Province, the provincial administration of Sichuan has been turbulent due to the entire political situation in China. Especially after Zhang Qun returned to China from the United States, it happened to be during the period of government reorganization. News came from Nanjing that Zhang Qun might take office as the President of the Executive Yuan. People generally believed that the speculation revealed in the newspapers that there would be changes in the overall situation in the southwest was possible and reliable.

Returning to Sichuan from Nanjing to Announce the Mission of This Trip

Zhang Qun returned to Sichuan from Nanjing on February 1st, and made a brief stop at Jiulongpo Airport in Chongqing, and then went to Chengdu. In this short period of time, he announced the mission of his return to Sichuan. He said that he had not yet considered relinquishing his duties at the Chongqing Xingyuan (Field Headquarters), but he repeatedly declined the position of chairman of Sichuan Province, citing his lack of energy.

In the meantime, the reporter mentioned the Xikang incident, which had been chaotic for many years. Zhang earnestly said that this was one of the main tasks of returning to Sichuan. How to deal with the Kang rebellion will have to be decided after a comprehensive study in Chengdu.

After Chairman Zhang went to Chengdu, the general speculation and disclosure in Chongqing newspapers were nothing more than Deng Xihou's official appointment as Chairman of Sichuan Province, Liu Wenhui's removal, the Mayor of Chongqing City being transferred to Chairman of Xikang Province, and Secretary-General of the Provincial Government Li Boshen being transferred to Mayor of Chongqing City.

"Protect the Homeland" Movement Petitions Zhang Qun

Following Zhang Qun's return to Sichuan, on February 2nd, people from Xikang in Chongqing established a "Protect the Homeland" Movement Committee, listing the political corruption in Xikang, the widespread opium, and the lawless military discipline, and put forward demands such as "removing Liu Wenhui, stopping military action in Kang, and appeasing the refugees." They petitioned Zhang Qun for the reorganization of the Xikang Provincial Government.

After Zhang went to Chengdu, he did not go to the provincial government to work from the 1st to the 5th, but only received guests in his private residence. On the 5th, he hosted a banquet for Deng Xihou, Liu Wenhui, Xiao Yisu, and Xiang Chuanyi, and discussed the current situation in Sichuan and Kang during the banquet. On the 4th, Deng Xihou also invited Zhang and the above-mentioned people to a banquet, and the theme of the conversation was also the current situation in Sichuan and Kang.

Following that, the Sichuan Provincial Senate made a request to Chairman Zhang, hoping that the provincial government could be responsible by a dedicated person.

A few days passed peacefully.

On February 10th, the Sichuan-Kang Pacification Conference was held in Chengdu.

Pacification Conference Discusses All Matters

The Chongqing "Ta Kung Pao" on the 10th had a special dispatch from Chengdu that was worth noting:

"Zhang Qun is scheduled to leave Chengdu for Chongqing within the week. The military, political, and personnel issues of Sichuan and Kang must be decided after being reported to Chairman Chiang. Zhang hosted leaders from all walks of life in Sichuan and Kang in Chengdu, and said at the banquet: I have followed Chairman Chiang since the 15th year, and I have participated in the opinions of the Sichuan affairs. In the 27th year, he served as the director of Xingyuan (Southwest) with Deng Xihou, Liu Wenhui, Pan Wenhua, and other military leaders in the Wanglingji Public House on the south bank of Chongqing, expressing his personal attitude towards Sichuan affairs. In the 29th year, he concurrently managed Sichuan's political affairs for six years. He has been deeply supported by all parties to reach the great responsibility of the people of Sichuan to resist the war and build the country. In the future, I am afraid that I will be summoned out of Sichuan at any time, and Deng Acting Chairman should be more responsible for Sichuan affairs. Sichuan and Kang were originally a family, and I hope that they will not be separated from each other and cooperate sincerely. Even if I do not concurrently manage Sichuan's political affairs, I will do my best to do everything for Sichuan and Kang with the relationship of hosting the Southwest Xingyuan..."

From this special dispatch, the changes in the military, political, and personnel affairs of Sichuan and Kang have been clearly revealed, and Chairman Zhang's ambiguous attitude towards local forces is also very obvious.

In addition to Deng and Liu, the participants of the Sichuan-Kang Pacification Conference also included Xiao Yisu, Chief of Staff of the Xingyuan, Liu Wanli, Chief of Staff of the Sichuan-Kang Pacification Command, and Wu Peiying, Chief of Staff of the 24th Army. Chief of Staff Xiao, Chief of Staff Liu of the Sichuan-Kang Pacification Command, and Chief of Staff Wu Peiying of the 24th Army reported on their work, and discussed and decided on future public security, opium bandits, and joint defense of the southwestern provinces.

Before that, Zhang had sent Dong Jianer, Deputy Chief of Staff of the Chongqing Xingyuan, to inspect the Ya'an area.

On the 12th, news came that Zhang Qun was returning to Chongqing.

On the 14th, Zhang was still not seen coming. News from Chengdu said that Zhang was waiting for Chairman Chiang's special plane "Zhuiyun," so he rescheduled to come to Chongqing on the 15th. Finally, on the afternoon of the 16th, the special plane "Zhuiyun" carried Zhang back to Chongqing from Chengdu.

At 4 pm on the 17th, Zhang attended the welcome meeting at the Victory Building hosted by Mayor Zhang Dulun and Speaker Hu Zixu. He reported on the Sichuan-Kang issue as follows: The Sichuan Provincial Government will not be reorganized for the time being, but I have served two terms based on the three-year term of an administrative official, so I plan to take full responsibility for the Xingyuan in the future. He also said that Deng Xihou, Director of the Sichuan-Kang Pacification Command and Acting Chairman, has served in Sichuan for a long time and has an excellent reputation, and will surely be loved by the people of Sichuan.

Handling the Kang Rebellion by Differentiating the Good and the Bad and Suppressing and Appeasing

Regarding the Xikang part, he said that after many investigations, opium eradication was a main cause. Li Yuanheng and others who caused the Lichuan incident were all habitual bandits for many years. The solution has been decided at the Sichuan-Kang Pacification Conference to distinguish between the good and the bad and give them suppression and appeasement. He also said that Chairman Liu Wenhui has been in Kang for many years. This unfortunate incident was quite stimulated and has realized that political reforms should be made. He will convene a Kang government review meeting to seek reform.

Zhang flew to Nanjing at 9:30 on the morning of the 22nd, accompanied by Hu Ziang. That night, he visited Chairman Chiang to report on the recent situation in Sichuan and Kang.

In total, Zhang spent 31 days returning to Sichuan from Nanjing, staying in Chengdu for 15 days and Chongqing for 5 days. The Sichuan government issue and the Kang rebellion issue were all taken into account. The Kang rebellion issue has already had the decision to "distinguish between the good and the bad and give them suppression and appeasement," but there has been no specific indication on the personnel issues in the southwest. Due to Zhang Qun's movements after going to Nanjing, it seems that the Sichuan-Kang issue has become less important, but people generally hope for stability in the southwest. In China, where opium is everywhere, the southwest is relatively quiet, but the unstable political situation affects people's hearts. If Zhang Qun really takes office as the President of the Executive Yuan, he cannot ignore this point, and dragging it on is not a solution.

Spring and Autumn

### Remembering a Wandering Writer: James Bennet

— Ying Ming

The Juxianju restaurant in the eastern city of Beiping, judging from its ancient and dim facade, can be determined to be a monument with a long history. Legend has it that since the Ming and Qing Dynasties, many poets and hermits of the capital often used it as a gathering place, just like the Fulu Shou and Xin Ya restaurants in Shanghai, which are almost famous for attracting literati and writers.

In the autumn of 1932, Dr. Jin Tonggu, a Korean doctor living in Nanchizi, invited me to Juxianju for a small gathering one evening because I was a regular customer of his—for treating neurasthenia—saying that there were several people of the same profession as me, so he took the opportunity to meet them. However, they were not Chinese. Because most of the people who came to him for treatment were European and American expatriates living in the eastern city.

Later that evening, when I took a tram from Xidan to the eastern city and then a rickshaw to Juxianju, the elegant private room that Dr. Tonggu had reserved in advance was brightly lit and filled with distinguished guests. When he saw me coming in, he got up to greet me, and the people present shook hands with me upon his introduction. Among them were two Westerners: one was very tall and thin; the other was of medium height, with a ruddy face and a rough appearance. According to Dr. Tonggu, he was the very famous novelist, Mr. Bennet from the United States. At that time, I was very surprised: Mr. Bennet was British and already over sixty years old, how could he be so young and heroic? Could there be another Bennet?

After a cigarette, we took our seats. During the meal, two Cantonese overseas Chinese mentioned many new scientific issues recently; and a young gentleman in a Western suit, said to be a close secretary to the deputy commander, then talked about several new discoveries in the marine world. I saw Mr. Bennet sitting in a corner, awkwardly using chopsticks to pick up shrimp kernels. I said to him: We are not bound by the custom of using chopsticks, it would be better to use a spoon. He smiled and said I won't be polite then. After taking two spoonfuls of shrimp kernels, he raised his glass and toasted me and Dr. Tonggu. Dr. Tonggu then said that there was an inextricable relationship between writers and alcohol, and asked him how Chinese Shaoxing wine compared to American beer. Mr. Bennet said that in recent years, drinking beer in summer and autumn was not very fashionable, and many people were used to "whiskey soda."

I didn't quite believe that this Mr. Bennet was the Arnold Bennet. I asked him what he had written recently. He was very happy, but he also made a melancholy expression, saying that he was used to living in the East and felt very alienated from the general life, making it difficult to find materials; he hoped to travel to Southeast Asia in the near future, because the weather was cooling down after autumn, which was the time to travel to various places around the equator. After the banquet, I asked him about the recent situation of several American writers—Dreiser, O'Neill, Fitzgerald. He said that he was not familiar with Dreiser, O'Neill was highly respected, but Fitzgerald was an idealist—so-so… He also told me many of his observations in China, and there were many comments in his words that I found difficult to understand. However, he held the same view as me, saying that artists were suitable for living in Beiping, because the climate and life in Beiping were not strict.

After the banquet, everyone hurriedly parted ways.

More than two months later, the frosty winds of Beiping picked up. I was going to the wedding banquet of a certain manager of the ×× Guoguang Society, and I thought of buying a gift that I should prepare, so I went to the flower shop at Dongdan Archway to buy a flower basket. Just as I got off the rickshaw, I suddenly saw two Westerners standing at the door of a Western-style wool shop next to the flower shop. The tall and thin one was the one I had seen at Dr. Tonggu's banquet. I greeted him and asked about Mr. Bennet. He said that Mr. Bennet had left early because his whereabouts were often uncertain.

In the twenty-third year, I lived in Hangzhou and often went to the library on Putao Lane (later renamed Daxue Road) to read newspapers. Once, I flipped through several American magazines and found the name James Bennet. The following year, I went to Shanghai and unintentionally talked about him with my friend C. Mr. C said that this Mr. Bennet was well-known in Shanghai, not only had he been a professor at St. John's University, but he had also published a collection of novels called "Plum Blossom and Blue Incense" by the Commercial Press. The few articles he wrote himself were very sincere in his attitude towards Chinese friends. Mr. C also said: Bennet was a reformer who did not flatter the Chinese. He held a dissatisfied attitude towards the old Chinese customs, although he inevitably carried some Chekhov-style satire, but the consciousness in his bones was correct.

In the twenty-seventh year, I returned to Hunan, and it happened that my younger brother Ren Yu had a copy of "Plum Blossom and Blue Incense" in his bookshelf, so I took it out and selected a few articles to read. I think the best three are—one is "The Woman Who Waited," one is "Singing Skipper" and "Wing's Interrupted Journey."

"The Woman Who Waited" depicts how Crandall, who was going to Sydney to take up the position of vice-consul in the consulate on a ship bound for Australia, became acquainted with his companion—a colonial military officer, and Ellery, a tax collector who was going to Australia to get married. He used psychological techniques to describe the special type of Ellery, which was very lively and vivid; he couldn't stop talking about his fiancée and "whiskey soda." "Singing Skipper" depicts a young singing skipper named Stanley Mac Tavish, who came from San Francisco to a certain port in the East to marry his fiancée A'huang. On the ship, because a Norwegian named Hicksby ridiculed him as a singing skipper, the two fought on the deck; many people on the ship felt injustice for Hicksby, and Hicksby also prepared to inflict terrible revenge on him because of his defeat in the fight. Stanley knew that things were not good, so he took a boat ashore before the ship docked. He went to his uncle's house, and a few days later, he discussed marriage with A'huang. Although A'huang agreed, she hid a layer of unexpected pain in her heart. She asked Stanley to prepare two candles on the wedding night. On the wedding night, she performed three rituals in front of the spiritual tablet with candles. Stanley felt that this kind of behavior was not good, and he couldn't sleep all night. Sure enough, the next day, when he and A'huang went out, they were immediately sniped, and A'huang was injured. "Interrupted Journey" depicts the violinist Joseph Roderick, his companions Sascha and Ivan, who died in a performance field in the summer due to a seasonal flu. In his serious illness, he was helped by his cohabiting writer Zi Lin, who cured his illness and became close friends. They took a trip. From this, we can see how well the personalities of people between China and the United States are integrated.

In short, although Mr. James Bennet's writing style is inevitably influenced by the realism of the twentieth century, the style is independent and there is no trace of affectation. His attitude is straightforward, and he does not elaborate on the story. By reading his novels, you can see the general life and lifestyle of European and American people in the East. Now, because of the United Nations, our close relationship is certainly even more advanced. However, friendship is not limited to formalities. We believe that Mr. Bennet's analysis and criticism of our lives is also a sincere expression.

### Preface to Translation of European Art History Outline

— Tian Qin

This translation of nearly 200,000 words was completed at a time when the publishing industry was in a slump! I really worry whether it can be turned into printed words. Because in today's world of soaring prices and people struggling to make a living, who would be willing to invest in publishing this kind of "unpopular" work, and who would be willing to calmly read this extremely specialized and dry article?

At first, when I started translating, there were people who advised me, "Don't translate these things, haven't you had enough of playing with theory for half your life?..."

My friend's advice was well-intentioned, because he deeply knew that the sales of theoretical things were indeed a problem, which also affected its publication. He knew that I was a poor scholar who made a living by writing, and that in terms of life, it seemed that I should engage in something close to "pornography" to earn more money to maintain my life. However, I did not accept this friend's kindness and stubbornly translated it. Although it could neither be used as gold nor US dollars, when I finished the translation before the drama festival, looking at the three-inch-thick folded manuscript, I really felt unspeakable joy! My wife was copying it chapter by chapter for me, and she was also sharing my joy and congratulating me naively!

The original book is titled "An Outline History of Art", and the author is Joseph Pjoan, a famous professor of art lectures at the University of Chicago. He has written three volumes of Art History Outline. The first volume describes the art history of Egypt, the Near East, Greece, and Rome. The second volume describes the art history of medieval Europe, Israel, the Far East, and American natives. The third volume is my translation, which describes art from the Renaissance to modern times. Each volume can be independent, and the content is very rich. In my translation, there are nearly 300 illustrations of famous paintings, sculptures, architecture, etc. in the original book, which are not easy to see in general art history works in China.

My close friend Wang Chongjie went to the United States to study the navy during the Anti-Japanese War. He knew that I liked reading books on art the most. Even though he was abroad, he still remembered his old friend. He specially sent me this book from Meiya America. Because the war was raging at that time and the postal routes were blocked, it took years to reach Chongqing in June last year. At that time, I was ill (the most serious illness I had ever had), and it took a month to recover.

Due to extreme economic difficulties, my wife had to look for work when my body had just recovered, so she joined the Youth Army to become a female soldier (now retired). At that time, my old friend Liu Qingbo lent me an elegant room, where the food and living were convenient, and the life was relatively stable and comfortable. It happened that the organization I served (a group of ordinary people) also stopped working due to demobilization, so I spent all day engaged in translation work, which went smoothly. The translator had translated twelve chapters when he left Chongqing on November 25. In the process of translation, the most time-consuming thing was not the translation, but the research work, such as the age and place of birth of a certain painter. In order to make it clear to the readers, I almost spent as much time as translating the book to check it. In this regard, I can say that I am worthy of my dear readers. To be honest, I am a student of drama and literature. It may be that there are errors in translating such a large-scale work in another field, but I sincerely hope that readers will correct them and I am happy to accept fair criticism for correction.

After I arrived in Nanjing (December 2), I originally planned to translate all the remaining four chapters in a month, but I did not expect that the problem of "housing" was bothering me, so I traveled several times between Nanjing, Shanghai, Nanjing and Suzhou. Fortunately, my old friend in the cultural circle, Li Binglu, resolutely refused to give his room to the gentlemen who topped his room with "notes" and gave me a room to live in for free. This is indeed a rare friend of justice in today's world of moral depravity.

Although the housing problem was solved, another problem came! My workplace is in Nanjing, and my wife lives in Shanghai. If we live separately, my entire monthly income of 300,000 yuan will be divided into two halves, and neither of us will be able to survive. Because of this, I resolutely quit my job and ran to Shanghai in a daze.

I thought that I could realize my dream of becoming a professional writer, but I knew that in the past half month, due to gold's curse, prices have soared like wild horses, and I shudder at the prospect!

After the victory, my old mother repeatedly urged me to return home early to reunite the whole family. Who would have thought that the overall situation would get worse and worse, and we, as victorious citizens, would not even have the right to communicate! Of course, returning home is even more out of the question!

Recently, my younger brother risked coming to Tianjin, saying that the family property was gone and life was quite difficult, and he hoped that I could provide assistance from time to time. And my old mother looked south from the door all day long, with tears in her eyes. With her ancient age, her longing for her son is becoming more and more urgent. How can this situation not make wanderers feel heartbroken!

The translator has been in exile for ten years. Fortunately, he has not humiliated his family style. When his old mother heard about it, she often broke into tears and smiled. When will I return north? It depends on the face of the god of war. Today, when the entire book is proofread, I will dedicate this book to my kind old mother's lap and keep it as a souvenir forever.

Finally, I pay tribute to the publishers who published my translation regardless of cost!

(February 19, 1936, Shanghai on a very cold day)

### "Family Flag"

— Translated by Chen Yin

One Sunday Mrs. John washed several of her children's diapers and hung them on the back porch, pinning them up to let them blow in the wind. After a while, when she and Mr. John returned from church, they saw the things fluttering on the porch.

Mr. John stopped and asked, "Mary, what are those things on the porch?"

"Dear," Mary replied, "that's our federal flag."

"Good," said Mr. John, "let them fly forever."

### Remembering Su Manshu

— Lu Mang

A friend from Hangzhou wrote several times, mentioning how the tombs of the female knight Qiu Jin and the martyr Xu Xilin were. Someone also lamented and said: The burial place of Feng Xiaoqing on Bai Causeway has been completely renewed, and the couplets can be recited vividly, but no one has asked about the poetry burial on Gushan for many years. In fact, in an era of forced smiles, it is originally about superficial embellishment, which is not surprising.

Among the tombs on Gushan, only Su Manshu's tomb has this relationship with me, but because of similar personalities, I especially miss Su's tomb. At this time, with the green and the spring情, I wonder what the founding poet, who passed away almost half a century ago, is fantasizing underground in the gentle east wind?

The title of "founding poet" is best given to Master Manshu, and the founding poet's sudden return to the Buddhist gate, looking at it today, is enlightening.

Manshu participated in the revolution and fled to Dongying with party members. After the Xinhai Revolution, he returned to China with party members. Others all enthusiastically ran to the political stage, but he was lonely and incompatible. Even if he talked and laughed happily with friends during the day, when the wine was over and the people dispersed, and the night was quiet and deep, he would transcend everything. Not only did he not catch up with the political enthusiasm, but he later entered the mountains for fear of not being deep enough. He is famous for being "also a hermit, also a knight, and also a writer." Joining the revolution is his "knighthood." After the success of the Xinhai Revolution and his return to China, his attitude fell into "hermitism." Why "hermitism"? There must be unspeakable secrets. Poets are not like political commentators, and they are unwilling to speak directly about national affairs. Poets originally belong to "gentleness," like Qin Shaoyou, Du Mu, and Wen Tingyun, who all turned their patriotic feelings into the feelings of lovers. Manshu became a "saint of love," "Returning you a bowl of heartless tears, regretting not meeting you before I shaved my head." After he entered the Buddhist gate, he still pretended to have these romantic feelings, expressing that he could not forget national affairs. Therefore, it is said that Manshu is a mature lover and also a truly patriotic man. He often compared himself to Dante and Byron, and his patriotism can be imagined, but he had already seen the difficulties of the country's progress and the future misfortunes, so he finally died of狂憂. It's just that he did not express the spirited and慷慨 expressions of the old men in the early Republican new dramas, nor did he have the integrity of Qu Yuan, who tied stones and投江 to create a sensational news story.

If we say that Manshu is a pure romanticist, why did he join the revolutionary party? If we say that Manshu has no intention of national affairs, why did he run to his motherland? Why was he so 清狂? Manshu is a warm-hearted person and a wise man. He initially joined the "Revolutionary Party" because of his warmth; after returning to China, he was so quiet because of his disappointment after observation. Some people who cannot剖析 the psychology of Dante and Byron are also unable to剖析 Manshu.

After all, he is a founding poet. His works are so unrestrained and畅达! However, also because of disappointment, many are哀婉动人. Mr. Zhang Mojun's poem says: "Since Qinggang is in the poetic bones, he wants to support the righteousness and arouse the soul of sorrow." When it is difficult to support the righteousness and the soul of sorrow cannot rise, poets often flow into 靡受愁苦. When we comprehensively look at Manshu's works, some are the voices of the founding of the country, and some are靡曼愁苦, which is not "good news." In him, perhaps based on his roots, or perhaps straightly revealed, but looking at it more than thirty years later, he felt uncomfortable on the day the Republic of China opened, which was truly not accidental. Talking about the "cultural people" since the founding of the country, Su Manshu is naturally the first. His wisdom, temperament, expression, words, and actions are all "cultural people." However, the characteristics of China's transformation period are precisely the characteristics of this kind of cultural people. Time is said to have passed for a long time, but compared to Manshu's era, it seems that there is no distance at all. After a ray of sunshine appeared, suddenly dark clouds gathered. Manshu, if he knew, would also be surprised that history is repeating itself.

History is repeating itself, but unfortunately, even poets like Su Manshu are not seen today. Is it true that each generation is worse than the last!

### An Inch of Mountains and Rivers, An Inch of Blood 194

— Ye Jingfeng

I think this sudden "protection" is indeed a bit strange. When we arrived in the hall, seeing that scene, it was indeed a bit irritating: the leader was indeed a woman, wearing a fashionable short cheongsam in Beiping, with a very beautiful and charming appearance, somewhat like Miss Pingzi described in Tsurumi's mouth. She was there, acting like it was a big deal, questioning the manager of this building. Behind her stood two fully armed Japanese guards. These two guys were really "阿　", I thought they looked like a pair of dung beetles; from head to toe, they were all round and round, so round that their arms spread out on both sides, unable to stick to their bodies, and each held a new German-style twenty-shot pistol in their hands.

Inside the hall, they have become their guard area, from inside the door to outside, lined up, all fully armed. The street entrance and the opposite street seemed to be full of murderous intent, but unfortunately the street lights were dim and the distance was far, and my pair of nearsighted eyes could hardly see clearly.

"Hey, quite a style, both quick-firing guns and machine guns!" Little Tiger softly told Yaoqun. This description just drew a picture of the situation on the opposite street that I couldn't see clearly.

"Sorry!" Tsurumi suppressed a burst of anger, his face aching, and stumbled over to participate in the Q&A scene between the female leader and the general manager. He spoke a Beiping accent, with a bit of a mixed meaning, horizontally up and down, even his walking style, full of what Beiping calls "a burst of膘劲". He used Beiping dialect because the other party also had a full "Beijing accent".

The female leader on the other side. Just acting like it was a big deal, interrogating the general manager who was dressed in rustic clothes. Tsurumi suddenly interrupted like this, of course it was a bit strange. In order to maintain the "dignity" under the current situation, first her willow eyebrows stood up, and then her phoenix eyes stared wide; very proudly:

"Um...?" This "Um" means "Where did you come from, Cheng Yaojin?"

"Um...!" Tsurumi was in a rage, discarded the gentlemanly manners, and gathered all the丹田底气, and responded with "Um" in the same way, the timbre was very thick, and the spacious hall was shaken so that the four walls echoed continuously. This action of Tsurumi revealed a bit of rascal aura, knowing that it was to answer the woman's "Um": it seemed to be saying, "You open your dog eyes and recognize the master clearly".

"Who are you?" She roared.

"Me?... I can't take care of it for the time being, anyway, you'll know it sooner or later—isn't it superfluous to ask?—But I have to ask, what's the name of your organization, and what mission do you have here?" Tsurumi said, taking out a cigarette, and simply became a rascal.

This scene made me a bit confused: if the visitor is Pingzi, I am afraid that this set would not come out. If it's not Pingzi, then who is it? Maybe it's the "Manchurian female dog" that Tsurumi just mentioned upstairs? But it's a bit unlike it, because the "female dog" came to North China with Tsurumi on the same plane all the way, and a few hours of sharing the same "plane" could not be said to be "somewhat familiar". Since they seem to be familiar with each other, both sides don't seem to have this kind of challenging performance.

"Beiping Garrison Headquarters!" The woman smiled coldly and carried out the "Tiger Head Brand", "Coming here, on the one hand, to search for 'unstable elements', on the other hand, it is not necessary to explain to you, and you can't ask—but, I, with the current authority, order you to tell me your relationship here, your identity, and your name!" She took out the notebook and raised her voice; she added a sentence: "This headquarters has the right to arrest 'unstable' 'reactionary elements'!" She opened the notebook, holding a pen, waiting for Tsurumi to reply.

These few words had great strength and a rather fierce momentum, with bones wrapped in the flesh. It was a bit difficult to chew, and it couldn't be swallowed whole. It's a pity that the person involved is a woman after all, the voice is a bit sharp and crisp; in addition, the breath is also a bit thin, inevitably a bit effeminate. This is somewhat like the line in the Ping Opera when Zhang Fei drank and broke the划陵 bridge, "Fighting without fighting, retreating without retreating!" It should have been shouted as loud as thunder, but Pan Qiaoyun in翠屏山 read it out in such a dainty voice, of course it was too tasteless.

### Idle Talk

— Wang Cong

It seems that Socrates once advised his opponent:

"Do you want to debate with me? Please first give a suitable definition to each term you use."

Confucius said: "The first essential is to rectify terms."

The two great philosophers of the East and West share similar views!

The abuse of language leads to the abuse of position, which leads to the abuse of relationships, which leads to abuse... There is a certain trajectory to follow.

Aunt Gu Ba kindly praised Chen Bailu as "sensual," "voluptuous," and a "masterpiece." The reason for this lies in her inability to understand the proper meaning of these terms, and therefore she cannot use them appropriately. All muddled abuse stems from people's lack of a correct understanding of the world before them.

I remember a certain prominent official visiting Shanghai. Impoverished university professors flocked to him, asking him to find ways to improve their lives and hoping that professors could obtain concrete living security.

One professor sadly cited an example, saying: "The living standard of us professors is far inferior to that of tea servers in restaurants."

The prominent official smiled and said very casually:

"Then, then you can go be tea servers."

The prominent official did not understand the proper status and dignity that university professors should have in a country and nation. In other words, he could not understand the proper meaning of the four words "university professor."

We really can't see that this prominent official is any more enlightened than Aunt Gu Ba.

Alas, muddled and confused; this is what is called the "status quo."

Many people have defined the term "philosophy." However, I particularly like Kant's saying—

"Philosophy is the knowledge that defines the relationship between science and life, thereby preventing the arrogance of knowledge."

According to his view, science and speculation do not have absolute value, but are merely means to achieve the highest purpose. Therefore, striving for morality is the highest duty of mankind.

In Kant's clumsy way of speaking, Newton, the philosopher of the macrocosm, had to yield the leadership of the world of thought to Rousseau, the philosopher of the microcosm. In other words, the objective study of nature is not the center of thought problems; while the subjective study of morality becomes the center of thought problems. In this way, pure reason loses its original absoluteness, and the keynote of the critical philosophy is laid.

Don't excessively trust your own feelings, as if they were an immutable truth. If truth is the father of the stubborn, that kind of "filial piety" is too incredible.

The reason seems very simple, because if everyone believes that the boundary of their own vision is the boundary of the world, this epistemological error will be unavoidable; just as the error of the eyes often makes us imagine that heaven and earth meet on the horizon.

Is laughter a sign of human happiness? You need to consider your own feelings.

Reflection is always valuable to anyone at any time.

"Great wisdom may appear as foolishness." What is foolishness? I think it is silent reflection. That is precisely what so-called clever people lack.

### Eating All the Stakes

— Li Zhi

Over the past week, large-scale embezzlement by ticket sellers has been repeatedly discovered on the × Road tram. Judging from the actual situation, this may be a concerted action taken by ticket sellers, ticket inspectors, and drivers. During rush hour, vehicles traveling from south to east are always packed to the brim, and ticket sellers collect fares from passengers but do not issue tickets at all. The trams stop and start abruptly, driving somewhat erratically. Passengers, amidst the jolting and swaying, cannot help but worry secretly about the ticket sellers' bold act of "eating all the stakes." However, in fact, ticket inspectors seem to have long forgotten their duties, and they are never seen jumping on board, causing panic among the leisurely ticket sellers. Ticket sellers have complained to customers who envy their abundant extra income about the "huge expenses" they face. We have indeed seen ticket sellers on the last tram secretly stuffing a roll of banknotes to the driver. All this indicates that this is a planned act of corruption.

From the standpoint of passengers, when the tram owner's income decreases due to ticket seller embezzlement, they will inevitably increase fares, adding to our burden. In order to protect our own interests, we must of course stand up and advocate for a clean-up.

But why do ticket sellers embezzle and act corruptly?

Generally speaking, their embezzlement may be due to their meager income, which is insufficient to support their families. However, the crux of the matter is undoubtedly the influence of the widespread atmosphere of corruption. To cite a recent example, when a female principal of a certain school was exposed by a teacher for corrupt behavior, she became enraged and beat the teacher's face black and blue. Not yet appeased, she patted her chest and said, "Do you think you can sue me at the ×× Bureau? Let me tell you, everyone in the bureau, from top to bottom, is on good terms with me!" (See reports in various newspapers.) That female principal's corruption and assault were so justified simply because she and the officials, big and small, of the ×× Bureau had "eaten all the stakes" in their relationship. If a teacher is so shameless, it is no wonder that the embezzlement by ticket sellers, who have a smattering of knowledge, is becoming more and more rampant.

(Note: In gambling, when the house wins everything and prevents the gamblers from stopping, it is called "eating all the stakes"; but the house in gambling needs capital and takes risks; like that female principal, except for using "relationships" as capital, there is no risk.)

### Ticket Inspector Assaults Prosecutor

— Heng Jun

Friends gathered, chatting about everything under the sun. The conversation turned to the incident reported in the newspaper of prosecutor Lin Houqi being assaulted by public bus ticket inspector Dong Hao. Each person expressed their opinions from their subjective standpoint, and although the discussion was inconclusive, it provided a glimpse into the concerns of the citizens:

Friend A: "Ticket inspectors perform their duties like prosecutors investigate cases. This dispute arose from buying a ticket past the stop, and buying another ticket would have solved it. Why resort to violence?"

Friend B: "A prosecutor is a law enforcement officer of the state. Taking a public bus already demonstrates a common touch. To be assaulted by a ticket inspector over a trivial matter shows the inspector's usual overbearing behavior!"

Friend C: "Indeed. In a city as large as Shanghai, with so many modes of transportation, similar incidents are countless. Dong was unlucky to encounter Prosecutor Lin, leading to his entanglement in the law!"

Friend D: "Those who work in public service are busy all day long and easily agitated. If someone disagrees with them, they retaliate immediately. Those experienced in the world avoid them."

Friend A: "That's not entirely true. One must know that life is for the purpose of service, and one should treat others with kindness and fairness, especially when working on public transportation. If one harbors resentment, life can be endangered immediately. Your words are tantamount to condoning him!"

Friend B: "The insult to the prosecutor is a small matter, but their arrogance cannot be allowed to run rampant. Dong may have acted on impulse, but the authorities should supervise and train them at all times."

Friend C: "The responsibility for supervision and training should not be borne by the Public Utilities Bureau, but by the labor union. Every labor union must have its purpose, and its purpose must not incite members to insult others at every turn?"

Friend D: "Dong has already been released on bail, and the legal issues have been investigated. Your condemnations are understandable. However, besides Dong, there are many others who are loyal to their duties, kind, and amiable. I recently witnessed a ticket seller helping women and children on and off the bus without any difficulty. Only later did I learn that he was a religious believer. The issue of training should be addressed through the influence of religious teachings."

Friend A: "Pedantic, pedantic! Haven't you heard, 'Even in a village of ten houses, there will be those who are loyal and trustworthy'? There are occasional virtuous people among ticket sellers; they are ultimately no match for the many who spoil things. If you don't believe me, we can set off immediately and try each bus to confirm this!"

Friend B: "Agreed, agreed!"

Friend C: "…………"

At this point, the hostess returned with her young child, flustered and upset. Upon asking the reason, she revealed that there were more than ten buses waiting at Nanjing Road, and when she tried to board, the ticket seller spoke rudely. When she suggested hiring a rickshaw, the other passengers supported her suggestion, and no one sympathized with her. She vowed never to take public transportation again.

The four looked at each other, and the conversation ended. They no longer considered conducting a field inspection.

### Laryngitis

— Shi Jie

A young man, suffering from severe laryngitis, could only speak in a low voice. Passing by the clinic of a doctor who had just moved from the countryside, he decided to consult him. He rang the doorbell, and the doctor's young and beautiful wife opened the door for him. "Is the doctor home?" the young man asked in a low voice. The young wife also replied in a low whisper, "He's not here, please come in!"

### The Skill of Eating

— Qi Lou

There are two meanings to the skill of eating. One refers to the size of one's appetite, and the other refers to one's ability to make a living. Considering the size of one's appetite as a skill seems unsuitable for a poor nation. However, upon closer thought, it is indeed correct. Originally, truly wealthy nations do not primarily rely on rice and wheat for their food. Only those of us who are on the verge of starvation fill our stomachs with rice for three meals a day. Using this to measure skill is both nourishing and simple.

As for considering the ability to make a living as the skill of eating, it is especially related to poverty. So-called making a living does not mean striving for a reasonable life for a modern person, but simply eating to survive. Once, a well-meaning student of mine said behind my back that I had the skill of eating, so I would never starve no matter where I went. Then my not-so-well-meaning wife repeated these words to me, which made me furious because I felt insulted.

"Hmph, he sees me as someone who just scrapes by!"

"Isn't being able to scrape by a good thing?"

"Oh, do you think that my work of literature for the sake of literature (writing poetry and novels), art for the sake of art (acting on stage), and working for social reform is just scraping by?"

"Being able to scrape by is already a good sign!"

"You see the value of life too low!"

"What's the difference between our lives and animals?"

"Do you think there are no things like science, art, music, and philosophy in the world?"

"All I know is that scientists, artists, musicians, and philosophers are always struggling to find food. All I know is that the children of Professor Li next door are only given a small bowl of rice per meal, and his wife cries and complains that he has no skill in eating. Besides this skill, what other skills are there, what science, art, and other nonsense are there, I don't know at all!"

"So, that bastard praising me for having the skill of eating is actually complimenting me!"

"And it's already an overstatement!"

### On Xiao Xiang Gui Guan—Recalling Little Male Actors of the Pear Garden

— Ting Song

Cheng Changgeng said: People know that acting places equal emphasis on male and female roles. For plays with paired roles, a troupe cannot succeed without a dan (female role) with high artistic skill. However, it is even more rare and valuable to find a xiao sheng (young male role) who is proficient in both civil and martial arts. Therefore, Cheng Changgeng's troupe regarded Xu Xiaoxiang as the pillar of the xiao sheng roles. In the past, the Si Xi and San Qing troupes competed with each other in the "Romance of the Three Kingdoms" plays. In almost every "Romance of the Three Kingdoms" play, if Zhou Yu was not paired with Xiaoxiang and Changgeng, the entire play would lose its brilliance. One day, Cheng and Xu suddenly had a minor disagreement, and Xiaoxiang left in a huff. The troupe's "Romance of the Three Kingdoms" plays were suspended for a long time. Those who were experienced in watching plays blamed Cheng for being unable to tolerate others. Cheng boldly said: I can also play the xiao sheng role. He continuously performed "Taking Nan Commandery" and other "Romance of the Three Kingdoms" plays, playing Zhou Yu himself. Kongming, Lusu, and other roles were played by famous actors in the troupe such as Lu Taizi and Yu Sansheng. Sansheng was the father of Ziyun and the grandfather of Shuyan, and originally had the nickname "Living Zhuge."

Xiaoxiang was from Suzhou and was particularly skilled in Kunqu xiao sheng roles. Cheng could only barely play the Huangpi Gongjin. He could not play Liu Mengmei in "The Peony Pavilion" or Ji Bizheng in "Stealing Poetry." Therefore, he eventually had to ask someone to mediate and force Xiaoxiang to return to the troupe, so that they could be called a perfect match.

Xiao Jiao Tian valued Wang Guiguan the most. Guiguan was the pillar of the xiao sheng roles in the Tongqing troupe. Tan once said: Leng Xian's artistry, singing, acting, reciting, and fighting, all closely resemble Xiaoxiang's. This talent is not easy to come by. Wang was especially praised for playing Gongjin, and had the reputation of "Living Zhou Yu." Tan's reliance on Guiguan was not limited to Zhao Yun and Zhou Yu in the plays, which could only be played by Wang. Even Bu Zheng's Jiao Gui and Chen Daguan in "The Top Scholar" had to be played by Wang. The "Top Scholar" was especially renowned for the addition of Luo Youcui's grave keeper, known as the Three Wonders.

### In "Paradise Dream"

### Regarding the Newspaper Industry

— Qi Yuan

Newspaper prices have risen, making "spiritual food" even harder to enjoy.

Newspapers have their difficulties, knowing it's a "suicide" policy, but there's no other way, they can only walk the "Huarong Trail."

Some newspapers are reducing their size to cope with the current crisis. In theory, newspapers should increase in size, which is a "normal" phenomenon and a sign of "cultural" development. But now it's becoming more and more "abnormal," which is very regrettable. Some newspapers have reduced their size and laid off a large number of employees, adding a large number of unemployed people to society and increasing the severity of social and economic problems. Here, we must point out that the government's failure to provide significant assistance to the newspaper industry is a misstep.

### Chronicle of a Besieged City

— Qin Shouou

June 14th of the same year

Old Zhu lay indifferently on the most comfortable long sofa in Xu Shaoming's house, his head resting on the armrest on one side, his feet propped high on the other side, his face up, his eyes half-closed, chewing on cheap toffee made by an inland candy company. A dozen or so small square wrappers for the candy were scattered messily on the polished floor in front of the sofa.

Xu Shaoming's servant, A Shi, repeatedly poked his head in to look from the door of the reception room. He felt that Zhu Zhaonian was a monster of the first order. In these few days, the whole city of Guilin was busy preparing to flee. Everyone who came to find his master was there to discuss getting a ride. His master was also busy all day collecting goods and arranging transportation. Only this Old Zhu came to wait for three consecutive days, and each time he had to sit for four or five hours, supposedly to donate money to the soldiers fighting on the front line. His master always avoided seeing him, but he didn't care. If he couldn't see him once, he would come a second time, coming during the day and coming at night, as if he himself didn't want to flee.

A Shi was also beginning to dislike Old Zhu, especially because he kept eating candy. In half a day, the candy wrappers would be scattered all over the floor. There was still residual sugar on those wrappers, sticking to the floor, making it difficult to clean.

But Old Zhu said the most terrible thing today. He said:

"It's no use for Old Xu to avoid me! If I can't wait for him, I have a way to make him unable to leave Guilin!"

A Shi was loyal to his master. He had just quietly told Xu Shaoming at the front door, which really startled Xu Shaoming.

"511, 5271, 5144, 321712,..." The unwelcome guest in the reception room suddenly began to sing loudly. A Shi didn't understand songs at all. For more than two years, whenever he saw Old Zhu, he heard him humming like this. Hummed over and over, always these two or three sentences. Sometimes the person hadn't even come in yet, but the song had already floated in. He really suspected that Old Zhu had a mental illness. Why did he keep singing this one tune over and over?

Xu Shaoming happened to be rushing back, covered in sweat. In the outer courtyard, he heard Old Zhu singing the "Wedding March" non-stop, and couldn't help but frown, hesitating for a long time while standing on the cement-paved flower street.

"Damn it! This guy is simply trying to entangle me to death!" He cursed in his heart. "Coming seven times in three days, it's no use for me to avoid him any longer. I'm so busy these days, if I keep letting him bother me, it will inevitably delay important matters... There's no way, I'll just have to spend some money reluctantly...!"

He knew that once Old Zhu's stubbornness was unleashed, it was unstoppable. If he continued to avoid him, he might make even more of a scene. (Nine)
