### Intensified Blockade of Mountainous Areas in Shandong Province; Communist Troops Prepare to Disperse and Flee; National Army Conducts Large-Scale Sweep in Northern Henan

[Special Dispatch from this Newspaper, Xuzhou, 5th] The National Army on the east side of the Jinpu Railway continues to sweep through the mountainous areas, and on the 4th, it recovered Liangshan, Wo Niu Mountain, Zao Shu Ling, Shangxia Wan, and other strongholds located 25 kilometers southwest of Feixian County.

[Central News Agency Dispatch from Xuzhou, 5th] On the 4th, the National Army in Southern Shandong had completely cleared out the scattered communist troops between the Linzao branch line and Feixian County, and joined the National Army on the Jinpu front and those advancing from Jinan to strengthen the blockade of the northwest, south, and three sides of the Yimeng Mountain area.

[Further Telegram] The communist troops trapped in the Yimeng Mountain area are now renamed the East China Field Army. The original newly formed liberation divisions have been reorganized into ten columns, each column with three divisions. It is widely believed that this move by the communist troops is a preparation to disintegrate into smaller units, hoping to individually flee during the National Army's search of the mountains.

[Special Dispatch from this Newspaper, Xuzhou, 5th] The communist troops under Liu Bocheng, gathering a crowd of 70,000, launched a desperate attack on the Pinghan Railway and Daoqing Railway in Northern Henan, making a final struggle. By the 4th, they had suffered a disastrous defeat, with almost their entire army annihilated. The remaining communist troops fled in disarray, no longer able to form any organized resistance. Along the way, in groups of three or five, they surrendered to the National Army. The captured and surrendered communist officers and soldiers all had swollen eyes, red eyes, broken feet, and limped, appearing like ghosts. This is because the communist troops in this operation were mostly strong men newly coerced by Liu Bocheng in Western Shandong, who traveled day and night, only eating two meals of thin millet porridge each day. Now they have been forcibly driven to the front line in Northern Henan to fill the sea of fire, which is extremely inhumane. For example, from the 30th to the 3rd, Yang Yong led more than 10,000 communist troops to fiercely attack the Yellow River Railway Bridge for four days and nights. As a result, only one communist soldier reached the barbed wire fence before being shot dead. The rest all perished before reaching the barbed wire fence, demonstrating the intense firepower of the National Army.

[Special Dispatch from this Newspaper, Xuzhou, 5th] Telegraph and train services from Zhengzhou to Xinxiang were both restored on the 4th. On the 3rd, the National Army in Northern Henan launched a large-scale sweep northward along the Pinghan Railway from Yuancun. On the evening of the 3rd, they joined forces with the National Army in Xinxiang. The remaining communist troops along the way collapsed and fled eastward along the Pinghan Railway in different directions. Furthermore, the 2nd, 3rd, 12th, 13th, and 4th brigades and the guard brigade of the 17th Division of the communist troops attacking Xinxiang fled northwest of Huixian County on the afternoon of the 4th at 6 p.m. The 2nd, 7th, 6th, and other columns of the communist troops attacking Jixian County retreated northeast toward Huaxian County on the afternoon of the 4th. The National Army is in pursuit.

[Special Dispatch from this Newspaper, Xuzhou, 5th] The remnants of the communist troops under Jin Shaoshan, Wang Qimei, and Wei Fenglou in Eastern Henan were annihilated by the National Army regiment on the 3rd. On the afternoon of the 4th, they collapsed and fled in different directions. One group of over 4,000 fled to Yangyipu, 10 kilometers west of Milin, and another group of over 1,000 attacked Ningling, where they are engaged in fierce fighting with the defending troops. However, the National Army has completed the encirclement and will soon annihilate them.

### National Army in Northern Shaanxi Continues to Advance; Recovers Anding, Baotuan, and Jiulishan; Key Pass of Laoduyaguan Also Captured

[Special Dispatch from this Newspaper, Beiping, 5th] Battle News from Northern Shaanxi: (1) The National Army advancing from both east and west after recovering Wayaobao continues to progress. The western advance forces recovered Anding City again on the afternoon of the 4th at 5 p.m., and the communist troops retreated toward Hengshan. The eastern advance forces have joined up with the forces bypassing Jiulishan north from Qingjian at Nangoucha, southwest of Suide. (2) On the morning of the 4th, the National Army ascended the key pass of Jiulishan. Three stone fortress positions on the mountain have been occupied. The communist troops counterattacked more than ten times, but were all repelled. The ferocity of the battle was unprecedented in the Northern Shaanxi campaign. Jiulishan is now surrounded on the east, west, south, and three sides. (3) Laoyaguan, northeast of Qingjian, was fiercely attacked by the National Army from three sides. After the remaining 500 communist troops defending the pass ran out of ammunition, they retreated to Zhendongjie. The key pass was finally recovered. (4) The Ma Hongbin troops, which recovered Dingbian, continued to advance eastward and were pressing on Anbian Fort on the 4th. (5) In the Battle of Wayaobao, the communist troops suffered heavy casualties. Over 4,000 bodies were left behind by over 20,000 casualties, over 1,000 were captured, and over 500 surrendered. Both the east and west cities were flattened by artillery fire.

[Special Dispatch from this Newspaper, Beiping, 5th] After recovering Pinglu, the National Army in Northern Shanxi is advancing along the east bank of the Yellow River toward Pianguan, Hequ, Baode, and Xingxian, guarding against communist troops in Northern Shaanxi crossing the river eastward. The Liu Zongyi unit of the Yanmen Military Region of the communist troops, with over 12,000 men, is currently concentrated in the Ningwu area, appearing to be holding onto the Yanmen Mountains. The Yao Zhe unit of the Suiyuan-Mongolia communist troops also shows signs of moving toward Wusai and Pianguan.

[Central News Agency Dispatch from Taiyuan, 5th] The National Army recovered Mengxian County on March 28. Nineteen of the city walls and civilian houses were destroyed. Refugees who had fled are returning to their hometowns one after another. The provincial government is preparing to implement emergency relief measures.

### Another Major Battle to Unfold in the Nong'an and Fuyu Area

[Special Dispatch from this Newspaper, Shenyang, 5th] The National Army and the communist troops who recklessly crossed the Songhua River northward for the fifth time may engage in another major battle in the Nong'an and Fuyu area.

[Central News Agency Dispatch from Jilin, 5th] Due to the National Army's continuous suppression, the small group of communist troops disturbing Changshantun (30 kilometers north of Huadian) in Southern Jilin has now crossed the river and fled eastward. Furthermore, there is a communist regiment in the Huashulinzi area northeast of Huadian, attempting to make trouble. The National Army has dispatched troops to suppress them. It is also learned that the 8th and 9th Brigades of the communist troops in Jinchuanlou Street (southeast of Chaoyang Town) have fled southwest after being swept by the National Army. It is further learned that about one division of communist troops has gathered in the Yushu Lalin River area. Also, the communist troops in Xiushuidianzi have been moving westward in large numbers in recent days, with some having reached the riverbank. Communist troops from Yushu have arrived in Xiushuidianzi, seemingly preparing to defend against the National Army's advance.

### Tumenling Tunnel to Be Thoroughly Repaired

[Central News Agency Dispatch from Changchun, 4th] The Jilin Railway Bureau of the Ministry of Transportation has allocated a budget of 20 million circulating currency to start the restoration project of the Tumenling Tunnel on the Jilin-Changchun Railway to ensure the safety of transportation between Jilin and Changchun. The tunnel, which is four kilometers long, was severely damaged when the communist troops launched their third offensive in Southern Songjiang in late February. Because the railway was anxious to resume traffic, it only temporarily cleared the rubble and sand that had collapsed inside the tunnel. Now, it plans to completely repair it to ensure safety.

### Press Corps Visits Yan'an, Interviews Civilians and Captives
Zhu Shaozhou Will Speak on His Return and Issue Relief

[Central News Agency Dispatch from Yan'an, 5th] On the morning of the 5th, the press corps visited wounded soldiers and inspected the defensive works built by the communist troops. In the afternoon, they inspected war spoils, interviewed civilians and captives, and attended a symposium with Director Deng Wenyi and Director Gu Xiping. In the evening at 7 o'clock, Chief Hu held a reception. The group is scheduled to fly back to Xi'an on the morning of the 6th.

[Central News Agency Dispatch from Yan'an, 5th] From morning to noon on the 5th, the press corps, in addition to visiting war spoils and the luxurious headquarters residences of Zhu De, Peng Dehuai, and Ye Jianying in Wangjiaping, spent most of their time in the First and Second Patriotic Youth Reception Centers, which housed the captured communist officers and soldiers. According to statistics, the National Army captured a total of 10,184 communist officers and soldiers during the Yan'an campaign. 1,705 were sent to hospitals due to illness, 1,514 died from serious injuries, 3,578 were sent back to their hometowns, 2,330 were sent to Xi'an, and 1,057 remained in Yan'an. The First Reception Center housed 898 people, and the Second Reception Center housed 159 people. In addition to the generally more sincere talks with the civilians, the Deputy Commander of the 1st Brigade of the communist police Chen Guodong, the Commander of the 771st Regiment Wu Yuxian, and the Chief of the Special Operations Section of the Security Department of the Communist Party of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, Han Ji'en, were interviewed in detail. Chen and Wu were stubborn and delusional, spouting nonsense. Han, who had been handling special operations for the Communist Party for many years and was extremely familiar with the inner workings of the Communist Party, spoke at length to the press corps about his participation in the Communist Party, internal contradictions within the Communist Party, and the communist troops' preparations to defend Yan'an to the death. The details of how the Communist Party forced the people to grow opium in Yan'an and how they plundered the people were all told to the reporters by the militiamen who had been taken in.

[Central News Agency Dispatch from Yan'an, 4th] The largest press corps, consisting of more than 40 units, and the first to arrive in Yan'an, the Beijing-Shanghai Chinese and Foreign Press Corps, inspected the relics of the Communist Party in the suburbs by car after participating in the review of the National Army stationed in Yan'an at 2 p.m. on the 4th. Apart from a library that was burned down by Mao Zedong, everything in places such as the Communist Party's Social Department and Kang Sheng's residence in Yan'an, the Central Auditorium of the Communist Party in Yangjialing, and the offices and residences of Mao Zedong, Zhou Enlai, Liu Shaoqi, and Lu Dingyi, was in good condition. The furniture was displayed as before, and even baby beds and toys had not been taken away. Many places even had a seal affixed by the Administrative Office of the Central Committee of the Communist Party with the words "Entry without permission is prohibited." This shows the urgency of their escape. In front of the Communist Party Central Party School in Wenhua Gou, there were slogans discrediting the head of state and the government. Inside, the tables and chairs were broken and littered with wheat straw, and the place was in a state of disarray because the 6th Cavalry Division of the communist troops had occupied it as a barracks before the Communist Party fled. This is sufficient proof of the decay of the communist troops' military discipline. Qingliang Mountain in the north of Yan'an City was the location of the Communist Party's Xinhua Broadcasting Station, Xinhua News Agency, and Liberation Daily. It has also been burned down, but regrettably, due to the lateness of the hour, there was no time to climb up and see it. It is only known that one part of the machinery has been taken away and another part buried underground. There are many remnants of newspapers in the ruins. On the way, we saw groups of kidnapped civilians returning, with unkempt hair and dirty faces, looking pitiful. The reporters also went to a wounded soldier hospital to offer condolences and saw dozens of wounded soldiers who had all been injured by artillery shells. The communist troops, with a force of eight brigades, continuously attacked a regiment of the defending National Army, but ultimately failed. The communist troops' engineer regiment was clearing the road when it accidentally detonated landmines buried by the communist troops in the suburbs of Yan'an on the 31st of last month. The wounded soldiers of the communist troops are currently being sent to hospitals by the National Army for treatment.

[Central News Agency Dispatch from Xi'an, 5th] Zhu Shaozhou, the head of the Shaanxi Emergency Relief Brigade, in order to solve the problem of clothing for the Yan'an refugees, has specially ordered that 100 million yuan be allocated from the emergency relief funds to purchase 700 bolts of white cotton cloth, which are currently being packaged. Once the transportation arrangements are settled, they will be transported north. This batch of cloth is enough for each Yan'an refugee to make a set of clothing.

### National Army Recovers Yongqing County; Security of Tianjin-Beijing Transportation Enhanced; Garrison Troops in Baoding Advance Toward Anxin

### Remnants of Communist Troops in Northern Jiangsu Cause Disturbances in Rugao; Suffer Fierce Blows from National Army in Libao; 2,500 Killed and Wounded, Retreating in Disarray

[Further Telegram] The communist troops attacking Libao suffered fierce blows from the defending troops and repeatedly reinforced.

At the same time, a unit of the National Army defeated the communist bandits in Xichang Dingjiashuo and continued to advance eastward, attacking the right flank of the communist troops, thus forming an encirclement.

### President and Madame Chiang Sweep Tombs, Also Host Banquet for Clan Elders at Private Residence; Festival at Xikou Town More Spectacular Than in Ten Years

[Special Dispatch from this Newspaper, Xikou, 5th] On Tomb Sweeping Day, the 5th, President Chiang and Madame Chiang, lightly dressed and wearing casual hats, took sedan chairs to Anshanwo, Taokeng Mountain, and other places to sweep tombs around 8 a.m. Chiang Ching-kuo and his wife and children, as well as more than 40 clan elders and descendants, also went to pay respects. The President and Madame Chiang walked briskly and chatted and laughed freely. During the ceremonies, they reminisced with the clan elders and expressed great concern for their recent situation. After the ritual, the President and Madame Chiang and their descendants and attendants went to the tomb of his father, Chiang Gong, behind the mountain for a simple and solemn ceremony. After returning to town, they held sacrifices at the Chiang clan ancestral hall. After the sacrifices, they returned to Fenzhuang and went to Madame Wang's tomb in Yulin'ao at 3:30 p.m. The mountain was lush and green, with dense pine forests. The words "Cian An" are inscribed on the tomb chamber, followed by an epitaph. The back of the monument commemorating the National Father's sacrifice to Chiang's mother is engraved with a brief account of President Chiang's libation to his mother, painted by Yu Youren. There are six stone tablets erected on both walls, all of which are the National Government and Kuomintang's awards for President Chiang's literary tablets. To the right of the pavilion is the President's residence, simple and unadorned. Today, the President and Madame Chiang presided over the sacrifices. Shen Honglie, Chen Yaoqing, Wu Xiao and others all sent wreaths, and Shen Honglie accompanied them in the sacrifices, expressing the utmost grief. Afterwards, they went down the mountain to the former residence of Fenghao, where twelve clan brides performed a temple visit to the President and Madame Chiang, offering tea as a gesture of respect. Madame Chiang smiled and offered her congratulations, and the President repeatedly said, "Good, good." They then watched the villagers' festival near Wuling, with dragon dances, boat races, and gongs and drums. Firecrackers filled the sky, and music sounded in all directions, making it the liveliest day in Xikou in ten years. At around 7 p.m., the President hosted a banquet for more than 30 members of the clan at the Fenghao official residence, divided into five tables. In previous years, when he returned home, there was only one table. This time, he was particularly excited. During the banquet, they discussed ancient and modern times and inquired about recent situations in great detail. The President said that this trip was the most enjoyable, as he had been working hard for the country for the past ten years, and this was his first rest. After the meal, a lantern procession was held under the command of Chiang Guoquan, the head of the clan, and the scene was unprecedented.

[Central News Agency Dispatch from Xikou, 5th] The people of Xikou believe that the President's return after a decade of absence has added luster to the mountains and rivers, and the whole clan is rejoicing. It was decided by the people of the village and the disciples of the Chiang and Ren clans that a lantern festival would be held by the whole town and that the Chiang and Ren clans would perform Ping opera for three days in the Chiang clan ancestral hall to show their welcome. The President, not wanting to dismiss the villagers' gracious intentions, agreed to their request. Today, after the clan members worshiped their ancestors in the Chiang clan ancestral hall, they began to perform plays on the stage in the hall. The people of the whole town, young and old, helped each other and went to watch the plays. Some came from dozens of miles away. In the evening, a lantern festival was held, with various colored lanterns and various miscellaneous items of local scenery. The sounds of cheers and firecrackers resounded throughout the sky. The joy was unprecedented in ten years.

[Central News Agency Dispatch from Xikou, 5th] On the evening of the 5th, the moon was bright in the sky, and the town of Xikou was brightly lit, with crowds of people thronging. President Chiang shared the joy with the people. The lantern festival gathered at the large playground of Wuling School at 9 p.m. The President, accompanied by his wife and family members, arrived at 9 p.m. and then appeared on the balcony, receiving warm cheers from the crowd. The lantern procession then moved slowly forward, circling the stage. In front were students from Wuling School carrying various colored lanterns, followed by gongs and drums, tall bells, a decorated boat, and a carried platform on which a scene of Jiang Ziya visiting sages was performed. Behind them were lion lanterns and dragon lanterns. There were five dragon lanterns, two 24 zhang long and three 16 zhang long, dazzling with light. The total length of the procession reached three li. The President held his young grandson on the stage to watch, seeming to be very interested. For a time, firecrackers went off in unison, and gongs and drums resounded through the sky. The crowd shouted "Long live President Chiang! Long live the Republic of China!" for a long time. After leaving the school, the President went to the Chiang clan ancestral hall to watch the play and then returned to his residence.

### Tanggu Northwest US Armory Attacked by Communist Troops in Planned Assault; US Marines Repel Attack, Five Killed, Sixteen Wounded

[Our Tianjin Dispatch, 5th] According to an announcement by the US military stationed in Tianjin, at approximately 1:00 AM on the 5th, an unidentified unit of unknown size attacked the munitions supply depot of the US Marine Corps First Division near Tanggu. By 5:10 AM, the attack was repelled by the Marines, with the attacking force fleeing north. Five US soldiers were killed and sixteen wounded. Also, at dawn on the 5th, the US ammunition depot in the Xinhe area east of Tianjin was also attacked by Communist forces, but they were repelled by dawn.

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 5th] The US armory near Tanggu was suddenly attacked on the morning of the 5th by approximately 2,000 armed men of unknown origin. According to a statement from the First Marine Division's press office, at 1:15 AM on the 5th, an unspecified number of troops attacked the First Division's armory near Tanggu. At 5:30 AM, the attacking force was driven back north. Five US defenders were killed and sixteen wounded.

[United Press, Beiping, 5th] Tianjin reports: The US armory attacked near Tanggu is located at Sidaoqiao, five miles northwest of Tanggu. The Communist attack was highly organized, with the aim of overwhelming the small garrison in the area. The Communist offensive appeared to be a coordinated effort, simultaneously cutting off supply lines between the area and Tanggu. When US reinforcements from Tanggu arrived at Xinhe Village, they nearly encountered disaster. The US troops stationed in Tanggu consist of the First Battalion of the First Marine Division, numbering one thousand men.

[United Press, Beiping, 5th] According to an official US Navy announcement, on the morning of the 5th, US Marines near Tanggu repelled an attack by an unspecified number of "rioters." The "rioters" infiltrated the area after midnight and attacked the guards at the US armory. The attackers' objective was clearly to seize hand grenades and other munitions. The initial message from Marine Corps headquarters did not reveal whether the attackers succeeded in seizing any munitions. A later message stated that the Marines were pursuing the attackers northward. Tanggu is located in the Gulf of Zhili, a few miles from Tianjin, and is used by the US military as a major port of entry for North China. Since the US Marines landed in North China in October 1945, they have used it as a port for receiving supplies and personnel, and have established an armory there to supply US forces. Around this armory, US Marine guards have constantly clashed with troops of unknown affiliation, but most of the incidents are believed to be attempted thefts. On October 3rd and 4th of last year, a hostile force attacked the First Marine Division's munitions supply depot in the Tanggu area. In that incident, one Marine was slightly wounded, one Chinese was killed, and another Chinese was wounded. The wounded Chinese, who was captured, told US investigators that the purpose of the attack was to obtain munitions for a Communist brigade stationed near Tanggu. Today's attack resulted in a higher casualty rate for the US Marines than the "Anping Incident" in July of last year, in which Communist forces ambushed a convoy of trucks transporting supplies from Tianjin to the Beiping headquarters of the Military Mediation Team, killing four US soldiers and wounding eleven. The armory attacked near Tanggu is located on the edge of a Communist-controlled area. Recent reports have mentioned a Communist scissor-shaped military operation from east to west, aimed at cutting off the 100-mile railroad line between Tianjin and Tangshan controlled by the Nationalists. Amid the escalating conflict in the area, the US armory is a valuable prize for both sides. According to well-informed sources, the Communist 59th Brigade has recently been very active near the Tanggu area. The abduction of a US Marine last year was also attributed to this unit.

[Associated Press, Tianjin, 5th] Six hundred Nationalist soldiers from the Second Army were dispatched to Tanggu on the 5th to assist the US military in dealing with the Communist forces. It is claimed that the Communist forces attacked the US armory near Tanggu on the morning of the 5th, resulting in one hundred casualties. During the fierce fighting, two light tanks were dispatched as reinforcements, but they were unable to reach the combat zone due to exploding landmines along the way. By the time the Nationalist troops arrived, the Communist forces had already retreated. According to military authorities, documents found on the bodies of the deceased proved that they belonged to the Communist forces, and the purpose of the attack was clearly to loot munitions. If any were looted, the number would likely be small.

[Associated Press, Beiping, 5th] The US armory five miles from Tanggu was attacked by rioters at 1:15 AM on the 5th. US troops stationed there engaged in a fierce battle for four hours and fifteen minutes. In addition to casualties, one US tank was destroyed by a landmine. During the fighting, several explosions occurred inside the depot. US fighter planes arrived on the scene, but the rioters had already retreated and did not participate in the battle. The wounded US soldiers have been flown to Tianjin for treatment, but six of them are not expected to survive. This is the second time in six months that the US armory has been attacked by Communist forces. The first attack occurred on October 10th of last year, when approximately 200 Communist troops looted some munitions and wounded one US soldier. The Communist forces left behind several bodies. Currently, there are still 8,000 to 10,000 US troops stationed in Beiping, Tianjin, and Qingdao. According to an announcement by US military authorities on the 5th, the US troop withdrawal plan will not be changed.

[United Press International, Washington, 5th] The Navy Department in Washington stated on the 5th that it had not yet received a direct, official report of the attack on the US armory in Tanggu, in which five US soldiers were killed and sixteen wounded. The reason for the delay in receiving the report is due to slow communication.

[Central News Agency, New York, 5th] According to broadcast news received here, the US supply depot near Tanggu was attacked, and five US Marines were killed. However, the news arrived too late to be included in the first edition of the morning newspapers on the 5th.

The Youth Party's list of candidates for the Government Committee was finalized in Shanghai on the 5th and is also expected to be submitted to the government on the 6th. Zeng Qi sent a telegram to Nanjing on the 5th, and Zuo Shunsheng informed him that the decision was being made. Zuo told reporters that the final decision could be made tonight. It is understood that the four Youth Party members of the National Government Committee have been decided as Zeng Qi, Yu Jiaju, He Luzhi, and Chen Qitian. In addition, the candidates for the National Government Committee from among social leaders will be nominated by the Chairman. According to reliable sources, the list includes Mo Dehui, Chen Huide (Guangfu), Wang _, and Hu Shi (however, Hu stated that he was unwilling to take the position due to the busy affairs of Peking University, but the Chairman insisted on inviting him and asked him to concurrently serve as the president of Peking University. If Hu firmly declines, Bu Congen will be appointed). From the above, it can be seen that the reorganization of the government is only waiting for the Chairman to return to Nanjing to announce it, and then it can be completed.

[Another Dispatch] Lei _ told reporters: There is no problem with the Democratic Socialist Party and the Youth Party participating in the National Government Committee and the Executive Yuan, but it still needs a final high-level discussion after the Chairman returns to Nanjing before it can be announced. Generally speaking, the announcement of the National Government Committee will be made first, and then the announcement of the Executive Yuan will follow. Lei also said: Regarding the issue of various parties participating in local governments, the government welcomes it in principle.

[Another Dispatch] There was no contact between the Youth Party and the government today. The all-day talks on the 4th had reached a concrete stage. Zuo Shunsheng met with reporters tonight and said that he had discussed the reorganization of the government and local governments in detail with Zhang Qun, and had submitted concrete measures, including the regions and candidates, etc. However, the National Government Committee must first be reorganized and established before the next step can be taken.

[Another Dispatch] According to reliable sources, the Youth Party is very eager for local government positions and has submitted a specific list to the government, including the names of county magistrates and commissioners in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Hunan, Hubei, Yunnan, Guizhou, Fujian provinces, and the municipalities of Beiping, Tianjin, Nanjing, Shanghai, Wuhan, and Guangzhou. This point is still subject to negotiation between the two parties.

### President Sun Yat-sen's Remarks in Shanghai: Government Reorganization is Indeed to Implement Multi-Party Tutelage, and Then Reach the Stage of Democratic Constitutionalism

[Local News] Yesterday, President Sun of the Legislative Yuan was surrounded by reporters at the Youth League Garden Party, who asked him about various issues such as the government reorganization and the demands of professional organizations to increase the number of National Assembly representatives and legislators. Sun was unwilling to express his opinion on the government reorganization, and said with a smile: "This must be asked of the Democratic Socialist Party, the Youth Party, and the people responsible for the government negotiations." A reporter told him that today's editorial in the Youth Party's newspaper, the China Times, expressed that Sun's statement that "the reorganization of the government is to change from one-party tutelage to multi-party tutelage" was a view held by the Kuomintang and that the Youth Party could not agree with it. Sun then repeated his explanation, saying: "The party-state government must be directly elected by the people. The people who participate in the government by various parties this time are all generated from within each party, and have not gone through the process of popular election, so of course it cannot be called constitutional government. And before the Constitution is officially implemented on December 25th of this year, the provisional constitution during the tutelage period is still valid, because the country must not be without law at any time. Therefore, today's reorganization of the government is indeed to change from one-party tutelage to multi-party tutelage, and then reach the stage of democratic constitutionalism." Regarding the issue of professional organizations demanding an increase in the number of National Assembly representatives and legislators, Sun believed that the National Assembly Representatives Election and Recall Law and the Legislators Election and Recall Law had been formally passed and promulgated by the Legislative Yuan, and it was difficult to change them. The reporter then asked: "Professional organizations across the country have jointly petitioned the government authorities, requesting that the number of National Assembly representatives and legislators from professional organizations be re-deliberated, and at least increased to 36 percent. What is your opinion on this?" Sun replied: "I have no opinion, but the issue of increasing the number must be decided by the new government after the reorganization," and so on.

### Kailuan Mines Actively Increases Production; Monthly Output Can Reach 350,000 Tons

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 5th] Kailuan Coal Mines is actively increasing production. This month, it is estimated that production can increase from 300,000 tons to 350,000 tons. If there are no other destructive obstacles, it can restore its pre-war annual production of 5 million tons in one year. If the transportation problem is solved, the industries in Nanjing and Shanghai can avoid being oppressed by high coal prices. The price of Kailuan coal in the area was also adjusted in March, with lump coal increasing to 255,000 yuan per ton. Kailuan has reserves of over 350 million tons of bituminous coal. Before the war, it was a Sino-British joint venture and the largest mine in the country. After the outbreak of the Pacific War, most of the coal produced was transported to Japanese "Manchuria." The equipment was not destroyed after the victory.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 5th] The US government has authorized MacArthur to handle the distribution of Japanese reparations materials and decided to allocate 50% (15% of the total amount) of the first batch of reparations materials to China. The Chinese government has not yet received a formal notice, but the preparatory work of the Executive Yuan's Compensation Committee has long been completed. According to a person in charge of the committee, the amount of these 15% of materials will reach 1.35 million tons. China has decided to dismantle and transport them back to the country in two batches, using China's existing ships and 16 ships from Japanese reparations materials as transportation tools. As for transportation personnel, the Ministry of Transportation, the Resources Committee, private factories, and various provinces will send personnel to supervise and transport them. The estimated transportation cost is approximately 800 million yuan. However, MacArthur notified China that each factory is only allowed to send one person to receive the materials, and negotiations are currently underway. The factory portion of this reparations material was allowed to be visited by us by MacArthur Headquarters half a month ago, totaling 65 factories, but there were not many heavy machinery.

[United Press International, Nanjing, 5th] It is learned that the first batch of Japanese reparations includes 64 warships. This fleet will be divided equally among China, the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union. The Ministry of National Defense will send a delegation to Japan in the near future to handle the receipt of warships.

### Executive Yuan Allocates 5.4 Billion Yuan for Emergency Relief in Newly Recovered Counties; Distributes Funds Based on Severity of Disaster

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 5th] In order to strengthen the relief of refugees in the pacification areas, in addition to the previous two allocations of 9.8 billion yuan in relief funds, 20,000 tons of flour, 50,000 cotton-padded clothes, and 500,000 catties of salt, the Executive Yuan instructed the Emergency Relief Headquarters to allocate 5.4 billion yuan to 108 newly recovered counties, which will be remitted to the brigades in each district and distributed based on the severity of the disaster. The amount of funds allocated to each district is as follows: Subei District, 6 counties, 300 million yuan; Shandong Military District, 14 counties, 700 million yuan; Southwestern Shandong District, 10 counties, 500 million yuan; Henan District, 23 counties, 1.15 billion yuan; Hubei District, 19 counties, 950 million yuan; Southern Hebei District, 3 counties, 150 million yuan; Central Eastern Hebei District, 11 counties, 550 million yuan; Rehe District, 4 counties, 200 million yuan; Chahar District, 3 counties, 150 million yuan; Suiyuan District, 1 county, 50 million yuan; Northern Shanxi District, 5 counties, 250 million yuan; Southern Shanxi District, 9 counties, 450 million yuan.

These relief funds are designated for the emergency relief of refugees in the pacification areas. As for general emergency relief work in various provinces and cities, the Ministry of Social Affairs has requested the Executive Yuan to allocate 1 to 1.5 billion yuan to each province to handle other relief efforts.

[Central News Agency, Lanzhou, 5th] The six counties of Qingyang, Zhenning, Zhenyuan, Cha, Huan, and Taishui in eastern Gansu have long been occupied by the Communist army, and the people are living in misery.

### Wang Maogong Inspects Southern Jiangsu; To Inspect Fengxian Today Before Returning to Zhenjiang; Says Security in All Counties is No Longer a Concern

[Our Dispatch] Jiangsu Provincial Chairman Wang Maogong has been inspecting various counties in southern Jiangsu for several days. It is now scheduled to inspect Fengxian today and then take the night train back to Zhenjiang. Before leaving, he told reporters that there were no bandits in the territory of the counties in southern Jiangsu, and the security situation was no longer a concern. However, local finances are still difficult. The central task this year is to eliminate the remnants of the Communist bandits in northern Jiangsu. Fifteen counties in northern Jiangsu have been completely cleared, and more than ten counties are still waiting to be cleared. The remnants of the bandits occupying northern Jiangsu number more than 30,000. The main force in the suppression is the Nationalist army, supplemented by local defense forces, who are clearing the areas separately. In the past, the civilian armed forces in northern Jiangsu were very strong, with one county owning more than 50,000 or 60,000 civilian guns. However, since the Communist army occupied it, all the guns hidden by the civilians were confiscated. Now the provincial government is actively cultivating civilian defense forces. Each county has 3,000 to 4,000 guns, and some have more than 1,000 guns. The civilian self-defense team has more than 30,000 people. The restoration of security in northern Jiangsu is very important to southern Jiangsu, because if the strength of the Communist bandits in northern Jiangsu is not eliminated, the Yangtze River, which is thousands of miles long, cannot be defended, and there will be no peaceful days in southern Jiangsu. It is hoped that the order in northern Jiangsu can be completely restored before the green gauze tents rise this year. Wang also said that although disputes between farmers and tenants in northern Jiangsu are inevitable, they are not as serious as rumored. The land in northern Jiangsu is barren, and owning dozens of acres of land is not enough to solve the livelihood of a family. Therefore, the Communist Party's land distribution policy has proven to be a failure. Moreover, the purpose of their land distribution is to collect military food. At the highest, one acre of land is levied up to eight bushels. Therefore, under heavy levies, the people are miserable. As for the repatriation of refugees after the recovery of northern Jiangsu, the provincial government and the Executive Yuan's Jiangsu-Nanjing branch provide free transportation and accommodation along the way. After arriving at the destination, they are uniformly rescued by the central government. Everything is going smoothly. At present, there are many people who are still stranded in other places because the villages are still occupied by bandits and they do not want to return to their hometowns.

### Ministry of Agriculture Forbids Cutting Down Mulberry Trees

Circular Issued to Construction Departments of Nine Provinces Including Jiangsu and Zhejiang

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 5th] The Ministry of Agriculture recently issued a circular to the construction departments of nine provinces including Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shandong, Guangdong, Henan, Anhui, Hunan, Hubei, and Sichuan, instructing them to order all silkworm-raising cities and counties to make clear and strictly prohibit the cutting down of mulberry trees. It is not allowed to cut them down arbitrarily due to temporary price changes and sell them as firewood, because China is based on agriculture, and sericulture is a profitable sideline for farmers.

### Suzhou Garrison District's Military Service Affairs: Draft Surveys Nearing Completion, Exemption and Postponement Reviews Begin; Family Allowance at Least 150,000 Yuan Per Man Per Month

[Our Suzhou Correspondent, 5th] The Suzhou Garrison District Headquarters invited representatives from the Shanghai and Suzhou press on the 5th to hold a meeting regarding recent work. Commander She Xu provided a detailed account of the military service steps. A summary is as follows: The initial step in implementing the Military Service Law is a background investigation, which includes all people between the ages of 19 and 45. Changshu and Wujiang counties have already completed this, and Suzhou is expected to complete it by April 15th. Next is the review of exemptions and postponements. Currently, Changshu and Wujiang counties have begun processing these, using a method that involves convening a Baojia assembly to gather opinions, which are then submitted for approval. The scope of application, in addition to what is already stipulated in the Military Service Law, has been supplemented by repeated orders from the Ministry of National Defense as follows: (1) Employees of the Central Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, the Farmers Bank of China, and the Bank of China, as well as employees of other banks with similar natures, and active-duty men of draft age in various government agencies, who have graduated from senior high school or above and obtained a military training certificate, may have their conscription postponed. (2) Medical personnel with the same qualifications as the previous article, or who have served in military agencies for more than one year during the Anti-Japanese War and have official documentation from the Army Medical Administration, may have their conscription postponed. (3) Students of nursing, midwifery, and pharmacy schools who have not yet graduated may have their conscription postponed. (4) Traffic police performing pacification and defense duties may have their conscription postponed. (5) Those who have graduated from teacher training schools recognized by the Ministry of Education and are currently serving as primary school teachers for more than one year may have their call-up postponed. (6) Those with illnesses that prove they are unfit for combat duties may have their call-up postponed. (7) Only sons who are solely responsible for the livelihood of their families, or whose brothers have all already been conscripted, or who are under the age of eighteen, may have their call-up postponed. (8) Those who have committed the most serious crimes, such as imprisonment for a definite term or more, and are still under prosecution or serving their sentences, may have their call-up postponed. (9) Specialized technical employees of the China Textile Industries Corporation may have their call-up postponed. In summary, it can be seen that the scope of postponement is extremely broad, and the conscription quota accounts for only one in a thousand of the total population, and no more than one in eight in terms of conscription years. Therefore, the chances of people serving in the military are extremely small. The fear in today's society is purely a mistake in awareness and unnecessary worry. According to recent statistics, the total population of Suzhou, Yuxian, and Wu counties is over 1,512,000, of which over 463,000 are men of draft age. However, the exact number of formal conscripts and the years of conscription will be determined after the entire background investigation is completed. What is gratifying is that the preferential treatment for conscript families has been concretely defined. In the future, the family allowance for each conscript will be at least 150,000 yuan per month. In terms of the conscription method, efforts will be made to ensure fairness and eliminate abuses. The drawing of lots will be done by county, or draft-age men can draw lots themselves. If any case of hiring substitutes is discovered, the perpetrators will be punished according to the Military Service Law with the death penalty, life imprisonment, or imprisonment for more than ten years.

### China's Land Reform Movement in the Last Fifteen Years

— Xiao Zheng

Written for the annual meeting of the Chinese Land Administration Society

Since the establishment of the Chinese Land Administration Society in the 21st year of the Republic of China, China's land reform movement has had a new appeal and a new struggle. Although the difficult national destiny of the past fifteen years has prevented the land reform movement from achieving brilliant development and results, it has at least made the efforts that should be made. In the past fifteen years, the achievements of the Chinese Land Administration Society can be listed as follows:

(1) The Constitutional Movement: The provisions on land matters in the National Economic Chapter of the Fifth and Fifth Constitution were formulated entirely by adopting the repeated suggestions of the Chinese Land Administration Society. The society's suggestions were based on the conclusions of two Constitutional Draft Research Conferences, which were sent to the Legislative Yuan in June and October of the 21st year to be included in the Fifth and Fifth Constitutional Draft. The New Constitution was promulgated on December 25th of last year, and all the society's proposals have been adopted.

(2) The Movement to Amend the Land Law: After the Land Problem Discussion Conference formulated ten principles, the Chinese Land Administration Society continued to study how to amend the Land Law and promote its realization. In August of the 23rd year, the Land Committee officially entrusted the society to study four relevant land problem proposals submitted by the Central Political Committee, which was the official start of the movement to amend the Land Law. The Land Law Research Conference was convened in October, and a written opinion was submitted in November. Finally, in October of the 25th year, the Central Land Special Committee proposed 24 principles for amending the Land Law. After three meetings of the Central Political Committee, the items were discussed one by one, and 22 items were officially passed on May 5th of the 26th year. Subsequently, the Legislative Yuan submitted its opinions on each item, and especially opposed the progressive tax system on land value reserved by the Central Political Committee, and debated with the society back and forth. Until April 29th of the 35th year, the National Government promulgated the amended Land Law, officially stipulating that land value tax should be levied according to the legally stipulated land value at progressive tax rates.

(3) The Land Registration Movement: Land consolidation is not only the forerunner of implementing land policy, but also a way to increase financial revenue. The Chinese Land Administration Society advocates fundamental consolidation using scientific methods, which has been adopted by the society's member organizations. Until the Anti-Japanese War, the land registration work of various provinces was progressing rapidly. Most of the society's members participated in this work. When the central government formulated a five-year plan in the 26th year, it also planned to complete the national surveying and registration in three phases. The Anti-Japanese War suddenly dealt a major blow to the land registration movement. However, after the capital was moved to the west, the southwestern and northwestern provinces continued the legacy of this movement and gradually advanced their work in difficult circumstances. Now that the reconstruction has begun, members in various places are actively engaged in promoting land registration.

(4) The Rent and Tenancy Reform Movement: The rent and tenancy system has a long history and deep-seated abuses in our country. The Chinese Land Administration Society has always had the most thorough and ideal proposals for this. It was initially planned to be trialed in Qidong, Jiangsu, and then planned to be realized in northern Shaanxi. However, it failed to be implemented due to the lack of strong belief and promotion power of the local government. However, until November of last year, the "Land Disposal Measures for the Pacification Area" were passed and implemented, clearly stipulating the protection of rent and tenancy and limiting rent to one-third of normal produce, and that tenant farmers have the right to obtain land with priority has proved that the society's proposals can win the warm support of farmers and the general social evaluation. The drafting of regulations and the determination of steps will gradually mature. The thorough reform of the rent and tenancy system and the adjustment of land distribution are of the same vein. The development of this movement is in full swing.

(5) The Wartime Reclamation and Soldiers' Land Grant Movement: Before the Anti-Japanese War, the Chinese Land Administration Society had already paid attention to the migration and reclamation of the southwest and northwest. Investigations and planning have been carried out successively regarding the wasteland reclamation and farmland utilization improvement in various regions. After the start of the Anti-Japanese War, the society first proposed a wartime land policy to promote wartime reclamation and soldiers' land grant movement, in order to promote national attention. It also suggested implementation plans to the central government, local governments, and public and private organizations. Eventually, due to the needs of the times, the establishment of public and private reclamation areas sprang up like mushrooms after the rain. The establishment of the Central Reclamation General Bureau in the 29th year can be regarded as clear evidence that the wartime and postwar reclamation movements will be promoted sharply. In addition, the wartime land policy outline at the beginning of the wartime grain requisition policy was the society's suggestion, which was adopted and implemented by the highest authorities.

(6) The Movement to Establish a Land Finance System and a Land Administration System: The completeness of the land finance system and the land administration system is the wing of promoting land policy. The Chinese Land Administration Society has repeatedly expressed the necessity of establishing a complete and systematic land bank and land administration agency, and has made many direct and indirect efforts to promote them, which has gradually completed the regulations and the gradual establishment of land administration agencies in provinces and counties. In July of the 29th year, the Central Seventh Plenary Session resolved to establish the China Land Bank, and in June of the 30th year, the China Farmers Bank temporarily established a land finance department to manage the matter, so the land finance system is also gradually taking shape. Although it is still a long way from the society's ideal, with correct proposals and continued struggle, it will be able to see success in the future.

(7) The Farmland Reform Movement: At the beginning of the establishment of the society, it focused on the promotion of farmland reform as the center of all movements. Before the war, it launched an experimental county movement to first realize the society's proposals in a small range as a demonstration for the whole. Therefore, Pinghu in Zhejiang, Lianxian in Guangdong, Suide in Shaanxi, and Linan in Hubei all appeared as land administration experimental counties one after another, but they did not achieve success due to war or political situation. The more satisfactory ones are Kaiyan in Fujian and the Huanghui Canal area in Gansu and the Beibei District of the capital are the initial stages of the implementation of the standard self-cultivating farmer system. In August of the 35th year, in view of the evolution of the situation, which has reached the point where actual land reform actions should be taken, the society suggested to the highest authorities to implement farmland reform as the center of economic reform and proposed an outline for the implementation of a five-year economic construction plan, which was approved by the National Defense Council and will soon be implemented.

(8) Establishment of the Chinese Land Administration Research Institute and the Jian Guo College of Law and Commerce: The research work of the Chinese Land Administration Society used to be carried out in cooperation with the Land Administration College of the Central Political School. After the reorganization of the Political School and the closure of the Land Administration College, the society decided to establish a Land Administration Research Institute in view of the fact that research could not be suspended. Preparations began in the 29th year and were officially established in December of the same year. It was also approved by the Ministry of Education to recruit graduate students every year from the summer vacation of the 31st year. In the spring of the 35th year, the Land Administration Research Institute returned to the capital from Chongqing. In order to cultivate talents for national construction, it expanded and established the Jian Guo College of Law and Commerce, with five departments: Law, Politics, Economics, Cooperation, Accounting and Banking.

(9) Publishing "Land Administration Monthly" and "Man and Land" Semimonthly and Various Series of Books and Journals: The society's propaganda products previously included two types: Land Administration Monthly and Land Administration Weekly, both of which were suspended due to the war. In the spring of the 30th year, the "Man and Land" Semimonthly was published, responsible for continuing to promote land reform. In April of the 34th year, it was changed to the Land Administration Journal (Quarterly) edited and printed by the Land Administration Research Institute as a forum for deeper research, and 16 series of books and more than 30 professional journals were published successively. The society's local branches have also compiled various publications for publicity.

The national construction movement has actually begun, and the society's responsibility is even greater. It is hoped that patriots at home and abroad will work together to realize the equal land rights and establish a new economic system and a new social system based on the principle of people's livelihood.

### Adjustment Committee Meeting Lasts Eight Hours; German Political Issues Still Deadlocked; Definition of German Assets in Austria Also Undetermined

[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 4th] The Adjustment Committee held a meeting at 11:30 this morning, lasting for eight hours continuously until it adjourned at 8:00 in the evening. The opinions of the four-nation delegations on the issue of the temporary political organization of Germany are still as divergent as before. Only one resolution was reached, namely to continue the meeting tomorrow morning. The meeting of the foreign ministers of the four countries was originally scheduled for 6:00 pm today, but was postponed until tomorrow due to the Adjustment Committee's deadlock. The three issues discussed by the Adjustment Committee today were: (1) The establishment of a central administrative agency to exercise the powers of the Ministry of Economy. The French representative insisted that Germans should not serve as ministers or cabinet members, but agreed to distinguish between important administrative agencies and secondary administrative agencies, with only the latter being entrusted to German management; (2) The tasks and composition of the German Advisory Committee (attached to the Allied Control Council); (3) The issue of a temporary constitution for Germany. In addition, the foreign ministers of the four countries also held a meeting today to discuss the issue of German assets in Austria, chaired by the Soviet representative Gusev, and immediately decided to request the Economic Committee to submit a report on this issue.

[Reuters, Moscow, 4th] The representatives of the foreign ministers on Austrian issues continued to discuss the definition of German assets in Austria today, but no results were achieved. On the contrary, the conflict between the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom and the United States became more acute.

[Associated Press, Moscow, 5th] It is reported that: In order to ensure the continuation of the meeting, Marshall will propose next week to place the Ruhr region, the industrial heart of Germany, and the agricultural and industrial area of Silesia, which is now in Polish hands, under the supervision and management of the United Nations. According to reports, the Soviet Union had previously advocated that the Ruhr region be jointly managed by the four powers, while Poland has always demanded to acquire Silesia and has the support of the Soviet Union for its demand. Marshall's intention now is to consider the interests of the entire Europe, so he intends to advocate that the two places be managed by the United Nations. Before the adjournment of the Adjustment Committee, the British representative Robertson suggested that the four powers should first determine the following points: (1) Whether the German people have a single nationality, or whether their place of origin should be determined by the state in which they reside; (2) Whether the German states are independent of each other and have the right to establish diplomatic relations and sign treaties separately; (3) Whether the central government can be directly elected by the people to obtain governing power or represent the governments of various states.

### Compensation Issues Unresolved

[Associated Press, Moscow, May 5] According to reliable sources today, the Foreign Ministers' meeting is deadlocked on the issue of German reparations. The Economic Committee has abandoned its search for a compromise solution and has ceased meeting to discuss it. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov reportedly stated that he does not believe President Truman's aid plan for Greece can restore democracy in that country. Molotov demanded non-interference in Greece. Other German issues are centered on the issue of reparations. Since the reparations issue cannot be resolved, hopes are slim for any achievements at this session of the Foreign Ministers' meeting. The United States and Britain may have to resort to a secondary plan, perhaps attempting to win over France, merging the French occupation zone economically with the American and British zones.

[Central News Agency, Moscow, May 4, United Press] Western countries today hoped that Molotov would compromise on the German reparations dispute, to align with Marshall's conciliatory gesture of accepting that German reparations could be paid from Germany's current production. Marshall's move is, at the very least, a strategy aimed at breaking the major deadlock in the Foreign Ministers' meeting. The next step should be taken by the Soviet Union. The Soviet side has rejected Marshall's proposal, considering it unsatisfactory, and has not yet made any move towards compromise. Marshall's proposal is far from the Soviet demand for $10 billion in reparations.

### McNarney Explains Current Situation in Germany

Accuses Soviet Military Authorities of Actions

[United Press, Washington, May 4] Former U.S. Commander of Occupation Forces in Europe, General McNarney, stated today that if the four Foreign Ministers cannot reach an agreement on Germany, then western Germany may form another separate nation, including the current occupation zones of Britain, the United States, and France. However, while this is possible, it is not yet being discussed. McNarney criticized the actions of the Soviet authorities in Germany, stating they are entirely based on the intention of spreading communist ideology throughout the world. However, communism has little hope of penetrating the American occupation zone; residents in the recent elections elected fewer than ten percent communists. McNarney also stated that the U.S. forces in Germany are not organized for tactical purposes and are insufficient to resist any strong nation's invasion. The Soviet occupation forces number as many as 450,000, equal to the total number of occupation forces of Britain, the United States, and France combined.

### Stettinius Tours Soviet Union

[United Press, Moscow, May 4] Former U.S. Secretary of State Stettinius, a potential Republican candidate for the next presidential election, is currently in Europe on a private inspection tour. Today, he departed from Moscow to travel throughout the Soviet Union, returning here in a few days before departing the Soviet Union via Leningrad.

### Yugoslav Deputy Prime Minister Issues Statement

[Our Newspaper] Moscow, May 5 Broadcast: Yugoslav Deputy Prime Minister Kardelj, who arrived here recently, hosted a press conference today, criticizing Austria, saying that Austria has twice served as a tool of German imperialism, and there is still a possibility of repeating this.

### Soviet Union Establishes Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry

### U.S. Should Take Responsibility for Preventing Soviet Expansion of Power, Senator George Declares in Senate

[United Press, Washington, May 4] The Senate today approved President Truman's proposal to provide $400 million in aid to Greece and Turkey. Senator George declared that the United States must take action now, or the Soviet Union will sweep across Europe. It is our responsibility to prevent the expansion of Soviet power. If it is not stopped, Soviet power will inevitably sweep across Europe, extending into Asia and South America, without end. There is now evidence indicating that Soviet power has invaded India. George continued, saying that the Soviet Union controls the Balkan countries in the West, and maintains strongholds in Czechoslovakia and eastern Germany, and also effectively maintains power in the three eastern provinces of China and Korea.

[Agence France-Presse, Chicago, May 4] State Department Middle East Director Henderson recently declared to the Foreign Affairs Committee here that the U.S. aid plan to Greece and Turkey will not only not cause war, but will strengthen the foundation of peace. Greece has a democratic system and is fighting for democracy, even communists who ignore Greek independence have the right to publish newspapers. The parliamentary opposition can also criticize the government, but this is not the case in northern Greece. Regarding the Turkish issue, the United States is willing to cooperate with all countries within the United Nations framework.

[United Press, London, May 4] Moscow Radio broadcast today that an Athens conservative newspaper carried a report from Cairo stating that the United States plans to establish naval and air bases on the Greek island of Lemnos, but did not elaborate. Lemnos is an island in the Aegean Sea, fifty miles west of the Dardanelles Strait.

### Investigation Team Should Remain in Greece

British Representative to Security Council Proposes

[United Press, Lake Success, May 4] Britain today drafted a statement arguing that the United Nations Security Council should keep the investigation team in the Balkan Peninsula, without directly criticizing President Truman's aid plan for Greece and Turkey. According to British sources, British Chief Representative Cadogan will speak at today's Security Council meeting, restating the necessity of keeping the investigation team stationed on the northern border of Greece, pending the Security Council's discussion of the report it submitted, and to provide supplementary facts at any time.

[United Press, Athens, May 5] Soviet Embassy officials in Greece stated on the 5th that although the Soviet Embassy issued a statement on the 4th saying that the Soviet ambassador would not return home, the current Soviet ambassador and his staff have decided to leave Greece and return home. The ambassador is scheduled to return home on the 6th, but it will be postponed due to transportation difficulties.

### Turkish Parliament to Hold By-elections, Democratic Party to Boycott

[Agence France-Presse, Ankara, May 4] The Turkish Democratic Party has decided not to participate in the partial by-elections to be held in parliament on the 6th of this month, so a new crisis has occurred in Turkey's internal political situation. The main dispute between the Democratic Party and the ruling Republican People's Party is the election law. The Democratic Party believes that the election law gives the government excessive power to control elections. According to observers here, the intention of the Democratic Party is to seek new general elections, but because the government believes that the partial by-elections are legal and the current election law is quite fair, the chances of general elections are very slim. Since the elections in June of last year, the Democratic Party has continuously demanded amendments to the election law. At its national conference in February of this year, the party decided that its members in parliament (about sixty in total) would withdraw from parliament. The Democratic Party's decision to boycott the partial by-elections on the 6th of this month will, in effect, restore one-party rule in Turkey.

### Bulgarian Parliament Meeting, Two Factions of Parliamentarians Clash

### Italian Economic Situation Serious, Prime Minister Urges U.S. to Provide Assistance Quickly

[United Press, Rome, May 4] Italian Prime Minister De Gasperi hosted a press conference today, issuing a warning that Italy cannot overcome the current difficulties without foreign aid. If the economic crisis deepens to the point of being uncontrollable, then the only option is to implement dictatorship. As De Gasperi spoke, the labor unrest in Naples gradually became widespread. Rome postal workers protested over high living costs, and national telecommunications were also paralyzed. Police in Scisciano clashed with unemployed workers, and eleven people were injured, including four police officers. While speaking, De Gasperi pounded the table to emphasize that the government will take all measures to implement the fourteen new plans to prevent inflation. If the people cannot agree among themselves, then dictatorship may be inevitable, but De Gasperi did not specify whether it would be a right-wing or left-wing dictatorship. De Gasperi expressed incomprehension at the U.S. Congress's delay in passing U.S. aid to Italy after the UNRRA ended, but hoped that the U.S. proposal to aid Greece and Turkey would not reduce its aid to Italy.

### Bevin Holds Secret Talks with Molotov to Discuss Four-Power Agreement, Molotov is Ambiguous and Does Not Give a Definite Answer

[Reuters, Moscow, May 4] According to official sources, negotiations to amend the Anglo-Soviet alliance will resume next Tuesday.

### Congress Party Makes Demands to Britain, Indian Impasse Expected to Break, Anglo-Indian Defense Alliance in the Works

[Agence France-Presse, London, May 5] Well-informed sources predict that the Indian issue will take a sudden turn at any time, including the possibility of Britain and India forming a defense alliance. Once the new Viceroy of India, Mountbatten, completes the current stage of talks with the leaders of the Congress Party and the Muslim League, Britain will discuss various ways to break the current impasse. It is heard that the Congress Party has made the following three demands: (1) Britain immediately grants the Indian interim government all the powers enjoyed by a dominion government, without any restrictions; (2) Before the constitution is adopted, the Indian interim government should be responsible to the Constituent Assembly, and the Constituent Assembly should be the interim legislative body; (3) The British Governor-General of India can only become the head of the Indian state constitutionally. If the above proposals are accepted, India is willing to negotiate a treaty of defense alliance with Britain.

### U.S. Military Governor of South Korea Advocates Korean Rule, U.S. Military Will Be in Supervisory Role

[United Press, Seoul, May 4] U.S. Military Governor of South Korea, Major General Lerch, announced today that Koreans will assume greater responsibility in the U.S. occupation zone to handle their own affairs. From now on, U.S. control will only be used to prevent political crises. For less important events, the U.S. does not want to impose U.S. opinions or methods on Koreans. The future policy of the military government, with a few exceptions, is that U.S. personnel will withdraw from practical work and only monitor from the sidelines in various provinces and departments, in order to make suggestions and correct errors. The purpose of the military government is to build a free, independent, united and unified Korea, governed by Koreans, and to revive Korea in economic, educational and cultural aspects. If only the second purpose is to be achieved, it will be quite easy. Experienced Americans can manage Korean industry, and with the assistance of American experts and American capital, Korea can be revived in a short period of time.

[Asia East News Agency, Seoul, May 5] U.S. Commander of Korea, General Hodge, who returned to the U.S. in mid-February for duty, arrived in Seoul today.

### Former Residence of Mitsui: Short-Lived Cherry Blossoms: Youth League Invites All Circles to Appreciate

[Our Newspaper] The cherry blossoms in the garden of the Shanghai Branch of the Three People's Principles Youth League on Zhongzheng South First Road (Father Kim Road) are in full bloom.

According to Zhao Yangxiong, director of the league's general affairs department, this garden was originally the residence of the general manager of the Japanese Mitsui Foreign Firm. It covers an area of thirty acres and has a history of thirty years. There are more than 200 cherry trees in the entire garden, all transplanted from Japan. They were designed and arranged by horticultural experts, so when viewed from the ground, each tree stands separately, but when viewed from the roof or a high place, it is a sea of pink, which is beautiful beyond words. Unfortunately, the lifespan of cherry blossoms is very short, only one week from blooming to withering, and they disappear with a rain. Even on a sunny day, they will wither in two or three days. When the reporter visited yesterday, he saw cherry blossoms swaying in the wind and sprinkling on the green grass.

### Reader Consultation: Medical and Health

(1) Unconsciousness

Hu Shaowen asks: I have been suffering from illness for nearly a year and have not been cured. When the illness occurs, I feel that my muscles and bones are constricted, and then I become unconscious. I only wake up after an hour. It happens every three or four days, or several times a day. I have consulted many doctors without success. I hope your esteemed doctor can give me a treatment method?

(2) Falling Injury from Riding a Cow

[Dr. Gu Yuqi answers] According to your letter, it may be epilepsy. A detailed diagnosis is required before a decision can be made.

Cao Yangzhi asks: I accidentally fell to the ground while riding a cow when I was young and was cured by taking herbal medicine. However, in the early summer of last year, the illness relapsed and worsened whenever the weather was overcast and rainy, causing unbearable pain. I don't know how to treat it. Please reply.

[Dr. Gu Yuqi answers] According to your letter, it may be an old injury to your waist, so you often have a dull pain on cloudy days. It is best to treat it with shortwave current and take an X-ray to diagnose whether there is arthritis.

### Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau Replies to User Inquiries

Dear Sir: We are sending you a copy of this bureau's public reply to telephone users' inquiries. Please review it and publish it in the social services column of Shen Bao. Sincerely, Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau, Ministry of Communications.

To a User Who Cares About This Bureau: Your letter of March 19 has been received. The public replies to the suggestions for improving the telephone are as follows:

(1) The "02" platform is installed by the American Shanghai Telephone Company. When users of that company need to call users of this bureau's Nanshi and Zhabei platforms, they must be transferred by the "02" platform operators. These operators are employed by that company and are not under the jurisdiction of this bureau. However, since there are misconnections as indicated in the letter, this bureau has notified the responsible personnel of that company to correct them. (2) The telephone number for the repair platform of this bureau is 101 or 112. The technicians who measure the machine value have been strictly instructed to use peaceful and sincere wording when accepting users' requests for repair obstacles. If there is indeed any rude or perfunctory behavior, users can record the date and time and report it to this bureau, and we will investigate it.

(3) The types of long-distance calls include calling, calling a person, and paging. The calculation of the call time for a calling number starts from the time when the designated called telephone number and the calling user start talking. If, after the connection, waiting time is required to find someone else to answer the call, the intermediate waiting time is included in the calculation. Calling a person starts from the time when the designated recipient or the designated extension or a certain part of the designated store or agency speaks to the recipient. The recording time of this bureau's long-distance platform follows the above regulations. As for the operators, they are never allowed to leave their seats without authorization. The inaccurate recording of call times indicated in the letter may be due to the user not knowing the type of call or wasting time. In the future, when users call long distance, please analyze whether it is calling a number or calling a person according to their needs and notify the long-distance telephone recording platform to register in order to avoid unnecessary losses.

(4) The various fees of this bureau are handled in accordance with laws and regulations. The amount of long-distance prepaid fees is also collected in accordance with regulations, but recently we have been ordered to reduce it to 50,000 yuan per household. Sincerely.

### Ministry of Education Designates Six Normal Schools in Jiangsu and Zhejiang to Study the Teaching Process of Teachers' Affairs and Orders Normal School Teachers in Twenty-Three Provinces and Cities to Engage in Academic Research

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 5th] The Ministry of Education believes that normal schools are the source of cultivating national teachers and are closely related to basic education.

The Ministry of Education recently designated six schools, including Nanjing Municipal Normal School, Jiangsu Provincial Jiangmi Normal School, Shanghai Municipal Kindergarten Normal School, Xinlu Normal School, Zhejiang Provincial Xianghu Normal School, and Hangzhou Normal School, to earnestly study the teaching process of normal schools and awarded each school a research grant of one million yuan.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 5th] In order to encourage normal schools to engage in academic research, the Ministry of Education designated 23 provinces and cities, including Liaoning, Xikang, Anhui, Fujian, Jiangxi, Hubei, Hunan, Guangdong, Guangxi, Yunnan, Guizhou, Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, Qinghai, Hebei, Henan, Sichuan, Xinjiang, Taiwan, Chongqing, Beijing, and Tianjin, as well as the four normal schools, including the National First and Second Overseas Chinese, Chengdu, and Longdong, to select excellent teachers to engage in academic research. It stipulates that the research grant for each topic is 50,000 yuan. The research topic is self-determined by each researcher, and the research scope is mainly to enhance the professional knowledge and skills related to the teaching of the subject being taught. The research personnel are limited to those who have passed the qualification examination and have continued to serve as full-time teachers in normal schools for more than five years and have achieved results. Application forms and project proposals for each researcher must be submitted to the Ministry of Education for review before the end of this month. If any special value is found after the review, additional awards will be given.

### Ancient University Professors Plan to Improve Teacher Education

Education funds should be increased by 15 times for those with higher living standards and 20 times for those with primary living standards.

### Publishers Plan to Request Ministry of Education to Provide Standardized Paper and Loans to Mass Produce National Textbook Harm

Massively Printing National Textbooks Hurts

The methods and detailed rules for printing national textbooks have been successively formulated and promulgated by the Ministry of Education. A portion of the publishing industry in this city held a special meeting yesterday to discuss the issue. Everyone agreed that after the reorganization of the Executive Yuan, it is still unknown whether the national textbook system will be changed. Moreover, the new curriculum standards will be announced soon. The effective sales time for these old national textbooks is at most one semester this autumn. What will be the way out for the remaining books in the future? This is a major problem. Therefore, many investors are hesitant. In addition, the production cost of each book is very high. Taking the format as an example, it is not convenient to use the format of the Joint Printing Office, which may involve legal disputes. If printers design and typeset on their own, each set will cost more than 200 million yuan, which will inevitably lead to business losses. Therefore, it is planned to ask the Ministry of Education to centrally produce the plates in the shortest possible time and distribute the finished products free of charge, so that publishers can reduce costs and avoid non-compliance with the prescribed formats. Moreover, since the restriction on paper imports, not only has the price soared, but it is also difficult to purchase. Since the promulgation of the detailed rules for the national textbook printing payment, the price of paper has increased by another 20%. Therefore, it is planned to ask the Ministry of Education to find a way to allocate cheap paper to cooperate with the textbook price limit policy. It is also planned to request the Ministry of Education to contact the National Bank to arrange loans and provide guarantees, with a loan of 2 billion yuan for every 10,000 reams printed, so that a large number of books can be printed to avoid a book shortage after the copyright is made public.

It is now reported that the students of the university have established a "School Protection Committee" at the departmental representative conference the day before yesterday, launching a school-wide signature campaign to appeal to alumni and the authorities, hoping to continue running the two departments, so that the cultivation of navigation talents will not be interrupted.

### Northeast Soil Research Institute Was Formerly the Continental Science Institute Established by the Japanese; It Has Now Been Reorganized and Temporarily Managed by Changchun University

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 5th] Twelve years ago, the Japanese established a science museum (Continental Science Institute) in the puppet Manchurian capital, Xinjing, claiming it to be the largest in Asia. After the victory, due to the repeated turmoil in Changchun, the internal damage was extremely severe, with estimated losses of more than 40%. Currently, most of the research work has been suspended. It is now only engaged in the production of a small amount of ergot, using wheat bran and microorganisms to extract drugs specifically for women's blood disorders. This once painstakingly managed economic construction base camp for the development of puppet Manchuria by the Japanese still cannot be used for our prosperity in the Northeast after the recovery. After the National Army recovered Changchun last summer, the institute was managed by the original Chinese staff members dispatched by relevant parties. In June last year, the Ministry of Economic Affairs sent personnel to take over and organized a management committee to rectify the damaged instruments and equipment. On March 1st of this year, it was officially renamed the Northeast Science Research Institute of the Northeast Administrative Office Economic Committee. The Executive Yuan's regular meeting approved the transfer of the institute to the National Changchun University for temporary management. The reorganized Northeast Science Research Institute on March 1st now has a research department and an experimental factory, divided into 23 groups.

### A Respectful Reply to Mr. Deng Gongsan Regarding National Textbooks (3)

— Lu Dianyang

Most of the selected authors in the six volumes of junior high school textbooks are contemporary, with no less than one hundred people. There is even an article from the Ta Kung Pao included, and there are many anonymous articles. This shows that there was no prejudice during the selection of articles. As for Deng Guangsen's unique exclusion of Wang Guangqi and Chang Naide, it is also puzzling. Wang Guangqi's accomplishments in children's music are extremely well-known both domestically and internationally. His article "Music and Life" and Feng Zikai's "Art and Life" can be regarded as masterpieces. Chang Naide's "The Failure of the Aggressors" vividly recounts the failure of Napoleon's invasion of Russia, which serves as a lesson for both the present and the future. There seems to be no reason not to select it for reading. Deng Guangsen has already criticized the party-oriented components of the Ministry-compiled textbooks, believing that they exclude other parties and factions, but at the same time, he opposes the selection of articles by non-Kuomintang members such as Wang Guangqi and Chang Naide. If there is no other purpose, it is difficult to conform to logic. According to the notes attached to the curriculum standards, it is certainly appropriate to select speeches and exhortations from the party and the country. However, among the more than 150 articles by various people in the entire book, it can be asserted that the authors who are not affiliated with the Kuomintang must outnumber those who are Kuomintang members. Deng Guangsen's claim of party orientation can be refuted without attack. It is extremely difficult to select works by contemporary people. With a little carelessness, it immediately becomes a label, "recently recorded," which is most inappropriate. However, since junior high school Chinese should mostly select vernacular works, works by contemporary people are inevitable. The selection and exclusion of this book are based on the important principles and negative conditions in the curriculum standards. It is hoped that when domestic scholars criticize textbooks, they will first read the curriculum standards in detail before giving their advice, which will be more appropriate. If there are any deficiencies in the curriculum standards, suggestions for modification can also be made. Currently, the Ministry of Education is separately inviting experts to revise the curriculum standards. It is hoped that they will pay attention to teaching.

(3) There are two points in Mr. Deng's views that the editors dare not agree with. One is Mr. Deng's view of nationalism, which is the most important point in the entire article. Mr. Deng advocates excluding Mongolia and the Qing Dynasty and establishing a Han-centric position, which is a narrow nationalism. In revolutionary propaganda texts, one can speak freely and use the most malicious words to exclude other ethnic groups. For example, during the National Revolution led by the Founding Father, it was fine to use phrases such as "drive out the Tartars and restore China" to motivate the people and overthrow the Qing Dynasty's politics. However, if in today's era when various ethnic groups are integrated into a large Chinese nation, this narrow concept is still emphasized, excluding other ethnic groups, then the consequences are unimaginable. In the past, Japan, and today's great powers, are always stirring up ethnic divisions in other countries to achieve their desire for encroachment. Looking around at the ethnic situation in various border areas of our country, one cannot help but feel chills. If the defense against the barbarians is further emphasized and the history of the Yuan and Qing Dynasties trampling on the Han people is deliberately exaggerated, causing hatred between ethnic groups, then it will precisely hit the strong neighbor's plan of division, and the so-called ethnic self-determination and independence movements will arise soon. The editors deeply agree with the Ta Kung Pao editorial "An Enlightened Policy Should Be Adopted Towards Xinjiang" on January 16th of this year, feeling that it is in line with the editors' aim in compiling junior high school history. The first goal of the Ministry-promulgated junior high school history curriculum standards is: "Narrate the evolution of the Chinese nation, paying special attention to the integration and interdependence of various ethnic groups, to elucidate the historical basis of the unity of the entire nation, and to fully explain the glory in history and the aggression of the great powers in modern times and its causes, to inspire students' will and determination to revitalize the nation." The Ministry-compiled junior high school history textbooks are edited based on this intention. The phrase "taking nationalism as the center" mentioned in the editing guidelines refers to the great Chinese nation, including the Han, Manchu, Mongolian, Hui, Tibetan, Miao, and other ethnic groups, regardless of barbarian or civilized, which is a broad nationalism. In fact, writing history books should be like this.

### Extra Time Decides the Outcome; Group B Jump Ball Decides the Final Again; Qingbai Fortunate to Defeat Railway; Wind Pure Helps by Sending in a Goal at the End

The Group B football league championship final rematch, Qingbai vs. Railway, was held at Yiyuan at 3:00 PM yesterday. There were about 2,000 spectators. Zhang Le was the referee. The two sides were evenly matched and difficult to separate. Railway's offense was frequent, and forwards Zhang Jie, Xiao Ziwen, and Lu Qingxiang had shooting opportunities, but they were all saved by Huang Shijie. Qingbai's counterattacks were also unsuccessful. The score was 0-0 in the first half. After the break, Yu Bai replaced Shan Tongquan with Cai Shengmiao. Railway made no changes. After the contact, the two sides attacked and defended each other, but both lacked a final point. The score was still tied at the end of the match. In extra time, both teams showed signs of fatigue. The stalemate lasted until ten minutes before the end of the match when Qingbai's Li Songyun got the ball and dribbled to the right, lifting his foot and passing it to the front of the goal. Railway goalkeeper Liao Qingxiong did not pay attention. Unexpectedly, due to the wind's assistance, the ball was sent into the net. Soon after, the whistle blew, and Qingbai fortunately defeated Railway by one goal to win the championship. The lineups of the two teams are as follows:

Qingbai

Huang Shijie, Xu Guofu, Zhang Fenggang, Zhang Renyi, Wu Jialu, Xue Peiran, Li Songyun, Dai Yaozong, Shan Tongquan (up), Cai Shengmiao (down), Li Songping, Mei Jianqing

Liao Qingxiong, Xu Kunyuan, Cao Liming, Lu Bingsheng, Wu Jiabang, Fei Chunlin, Wu Binghao, Xiao Ziwen, Zhang Jie, Lu Qingxiang, Lin Dianyi

### Preparations for Next Year's World Games to Be Accelerated; British Preparatory Committee Issues Statement; Prime Minister Guarantees Full Government Support

[United Press, London, 4th] The British government recently banned large-scale sporting events outside of holidays to avoid attracting spectators and hindering production work. This has led to widespread concern that the World Games to be held in London in 1948 may be hindered. A spokesman for the British World Games Preparatory Committee issued a statement today to clarify, saying: Prime Minister Attlee has guaranteed his support for our role as hosts for the World Games. We are now preparing at full speed. The World Games will not be canceled, postponed, or held in another country. A spokesman for the Prime Minister's Office also said: The government's previous guarantee to sponsor the World Games has not changed, and there are no problems with funding. Wembley Stadium, which provides the sports venue, has allowed the preparatory committee to advance $400,000, which will be repaid from ticket sales in the future.

### Hong Kong Island Soccer News: Shanghai Stars' Tour of Hong Kong

[Our Newspaper, Hong Kong Airmail] The Shanghai Stars table tennis team visited Hong Kong. On the evening of the 20th, they played their first match at the China Youth Gymnasium against the Eastern team. The audience was exceptionally crowded to watch the match. As a result, the Eastern team fought hard and defeated the visiting team with a score of 13 to 11.

The match adopted international rules, with five players rotating. The first team to win 13 games won. Since the start of the match, the two sides competed fiercely. From 7:00 PM to 11:00 PM, the score was still 11 to 11. It was not until the last game that the Eastern team finally won two points, overwhelming the Shanghai Stars.

In the first game, the Shanghai Stars won 3 to 2. In the second game, the Eastern team won 3 to 2. In the third game, the Shanghai Stars won 3 to 2. In the fourth game, the Eastern team won 3 to 2. In the final game, the Eastern team won again 3 to 1. In this match, Wang Youxin of the Shanghai Stars performed very well and did not encounter any opponents.

On the evening of the 21st, the Shanghai Stars continued to clash with the Confucian Society. In terms of talent, the Confucian Society was indeed better than the Eastern team. However, the Shanghai Stars, feeling the loss of the previous night, used all their strength. Lu Hanjun and Xue Xuchu had already regained their level. Wang Youxin, who had won all the previous night, was defeated by Zhong Zhancheng. With the efforts of all the generals, the Shanghai Stars won with a score of 13 to 8 after only 21 games. The lineups of both sides were:

(Shanghai Stars) Fu Qifang, Xue Xuchu, Wang Youxin, Lu Hanjun, Huang Zhijun.

(Confucian Society) Li Ping, Zheng Guorong, Zhong Zhancheng, Xiao Shaoqiu, Zhu Jizhi.

The final battle continued on the evening of the 22nd. The venue was still the China Youth Gymnasium. The Hong Kong United team was formed to face the Shanghai Stars. Although the fans were not as enthusiastic as in the first battle, they were more crowded than in the second battle.

Because the Shanghai Stars had the experience of two battles, they were already familiar with the playing styles of the Hong Kong players and had coping methods. When they fought, they repeatedly gained the upper hand. In this battle, the Hong Kong team responded with:

Zhong Zhancheng, Zhou Zhenqiu, Huang Yecheng, Chen Nengli, and Li Ping as the five generals. The Shanghai Stars used the same lineup as the previous battle. After the engagement, both sides played steadily. Until the eighth game, it was still alternating wins and losses, and it was difficult to determine the outcome.

However, after the ninth game, the Shanghai side won three points in a row, followed by two advantages in the thirteenth and fourteenth games. In the fifteenth game, the Hong Kong side made a counterattack and regained three points. After that, there was no more improvement. The Shanghai Stars finally defeated the Hong Kong United team with a score of 13 to 8.

The Shanghai Stars' tour of Hong Kong is over. They are scheduled to go to Macau on the 24th. If time permits, they will go to Guangzhou for a trip before returning to Shanghai.

Low-end goods such as Yuan Bijie, light-colored shirting, and fine cloth bleaching cloth are being bought up, causing prices to rise frequently in the market. 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth rose from 166,000 yuan to 170,000 yuan, an increase of 4,000 yuan compared to the previous day.

Trading was not brisk.

### United Price Desire to Rise Lacking Strength

Public bonds experienced a brief surge yesterday. Unified C bonds opened at 12,400 yuan and rose to 14,300 yuan, but scattered buying could not be sustained.

### Emergency Measures by the Sugar Industry Association - Trading Limited to Spot Goods - Strict Prohibition of Illegal Trading of Warehouse Receipts

The price of sugar has been soaring repeatedly. The crux of the matter is purely due to illegal trading by speculators. The Sugar Industry Association has taken special emergency measures to strictly prohibit it. The announcement is recorded as follows: "It is found that the industry has always traded spot goods. Recently, warehouse receipt trading has been discovered. The 70th emergency meeting of the directors and supervisors decided to prohibit warehouse receipt trading from now on. All industry trading, regardless of the type of sugar, is limited to spot goods in this warehouse. No sugar transaction shall exceed legal profits. If anyone violates this secretly, once verified, the membership of both the buyer and seller will be revoked. If there is an intermediary agent, the agent will also be expelled and it has been stipulated that the association will suspend trading in the afternoon," it is said.

Temporary Market Closure

[Another Dispatch] The sugar market has been relatively strong in recent days due to strong customer demand. Yesterday, in order to avoid black market activity, the association decided to close the market for five days as a restriction.

After this suppression, the sugar market may ease, it is said.

### Pre-Qingming Longjing Tea on the Market

Yesterday was the Qingming Festival in the lunar calendar, and the new tea from the major tea shops in this city has already been on the market. According to reports, this batch of new tea was harvested and baked in the Hangzhou, Wenzhou, and Pingshan producing areas before the festival, and then shipped to Shanghai, called Pre-Qingming Longjing. The total quantity is extremely small, no more than dozens of catties, and it is brought to Shanghai by tea merchants and sold to famous tea shops, commonly known as "reporting tea," with asking prices being extremely high. The first batch of West Lake Longjing is 160,000 yuan per catty, and Wenzhou goods are about 30% lower. The selling price of the above two teas is halved. It is reported that this spring, Pre-Qingming tea is of good color, aroma, and taste due to little rain. If the weather is clear and sunny around Grain Rain, the harvest of alpine tea will be even better. According to tea industry insiders, the national tea harvest this year is estimated to increase by 50% compared to last year. The reasons are: (1) Tea farmers are gradually paying attention to this, and the work of fertilizing and weeding last winter has been improved. (2) Tea loans are relaxed, and tea farmers and tea merchants have expressed great interest. (3) After the victory, the tea gardens that were devastated in various places are striving to recover.

### Jinshan Branches Rise

The price of Jinshan yuanzhi (元枝, a type of local product), has recently been tight. The asking price is 450,000 yuan. It was checked that the previous market quotation opened at around 420,000 yuan. The day before yesterday, it opened up to 440,000 yuan. Yesterday, it was quoted at 450,000 yuan and the market is expected to remain tight.

### Weak Circulation in Tea Market

Although the peak season for the new production of various domestic teas such as Longjing is approaching, those who hold the goods are not willing to relax their sales intentions for the old stock in hand. Due to the fact that both sales in this street and to visiting merchants are extremely sluggish, buyers are only purchasing in small amounts. Yesterday's situation remained the same, with the amount of tea sold being roughly equal to the amount purchased, and the market trend was relatively flat. As for the foreign tea market, the general cargo owners still frequently offered their goods, but those who asked about the price stood by and watched, and the situation remained unchanged. The market price hovered on a downward trend.

[Our Dispatch] According to a survey by the Industry and Commerce Guidance Office: There are 330 members of the Leather Industry Association in this city, divided into four groups: A, B, C, and D. Group A manufactures sole leather, with a total of 14 members. Group B manufactures upper leather, with a total of 113 members. Group C manufactures suitcase leather, white green leather, and sheepskin, with a total of 138 members. Group D manufactures gloves and wallets, with a total of 65 members.

Members of groups A and B mostly have simple machines. Other leather workshops are mostly handicrafts, and the scale is not large. The monthly output is as little as ten pieces and as much as dozens of pieces. There is no fixed plan for work. When the market improves or the economy is abundant, they purchase raw hides and engage in manufacturing. If the situation is not good, they work intermittently.

The recent production of leather factories in this city is 300,000 pounds of sole leather, 45,000 feet of calfskin, and 60,000 feet of upper sheepskin per month. Among them, the total output of sole leather in March has been reduced to 200,000 pounds. The factories taken over by the government from the enemy and puppet regimes produce about 60,000 pounds per month. The quality of this sole leather is far superior to imported products, but the upper leather is inferior.

The difficulties currently facing the industry are three: (1) The new commodity tax rate is 15%. According to the industry's most prosperous production scene, the tax revenue is only 170,625,000 yuan. The national treasury revenue is very small, while the burden on the leather industry has increased significantly. Therefore, the industry hopes that the government will collect taxes again when the leather industry develops.

(2) Currently, due to the dumping of foreign goods, the industry has to depreciate prices in order to maintain business. Since March and April, the funds earned by various businesses are only enough to pay wages and business expenses, so they have reduced work or stopped work. Those who are in a state of stagnation have reached two-tenths. Therefore, the industry hopes that the government will prohibit the import of hot leather.

(3) The industry's costs have increased due to the burden of high-interest loans. If low-interest loans can be obtained, the cost of sole leather can be reduced by 2,000 yuan per pound, and the cost of upper leather can also be reduced by 800 yuan. Therefore, it is hoped that the government will approve small loans.

### Insurance Companies Require Capital of at Least 100 Million

In order to rectify the insurance system, increase the compensation funds of various insurance companies, and achieve the goal of insurance security, the Ministry of Finance has specifically set the minimum capital amount for each insurance company to 100 million yuan. The original amount was 5 million yuan. Companies that have already been established and operating with capital of less than 100 million yuan must complete the capital increase verification procedures before the end of June of this year. Otherwise, they will be ordered to merge with companies with weak capital. For newly established companies, operations will be approved when the capital reaches 50 million. According to insurance industry insiders, this adjustment is the biggest reform in eight years.

### New Da Weaving Factory Officially Starts Operation

The New Da Weaving Factory, among the weaving factories in Shanghai, has always been known as a large-scale silk factory, with sections for wool weaving, silk weaving, and cotton weaving. The factory's products are sold to various parts of Southeast Asia and enjoy a good reputation. Unfortunately, due to mismanagement and operational issues, its finances were not stable. Since it was purchased in full last month by Mr. Fu Liangjun of the New Light Underwear Company, it has been carefully planned, the organization has been improved, and it has now officially started operation. In addition to being used for the manufacture of underwear, several new products will be launched. According to experts, the factory's total assets are estimated to be at least 5 billion yuan.

### State-Owned Production Enterprises Valued Separately

[Our Dispatch] Minister Wang of the Ministry of Economic Affairs arrived in Shanghai yesterday. When reporters asked whether state-owned production enterprises would still be valued and sold since the government had stipulated that a portion of them would be used as a short-term treasury bond fund for the 36th year, Mr. Wang replied: "The valuation and sale of state-owned production enterprises is still actively underway. This is because there are many types of state-owned production enterprises and the institutions are large. Although a portion has been transferred to the short-term treasury bond fund, the valuation and sale will not be interrupted because of this. However, in the future, state-owned production enterprises that have been transferred to the short-term treasury bond fund will not be sold. Other parts will still be planned for sale and transferred to private operation," he said.

### Bulls Seize the Opportunity - High and Then Low in Chinese Stocks

Chinese stocks were high and then low yesterday. Because the large yarn and flower merchant Mr. Hong was selling, the general bull also took the opportunity to sell, resulting in a high opening followed by a decline. The resistance of new buyers was weak, and the market closed at a low price near noon, causing scattered investors to feel panicked again. The morning opened high and then fell. Numbers 185, 16, 83, and 180 all advanced, and Deyong Yarn saw a high price of 2,680 yuan. Numbers 223, 89, 198, 84, 222, 160, 104, 13, and 232 were sold at a high price of 2,620 yuan. Numbers 196, 97, 89, and 142 still advanced and rose slightly, but soon Numbers 154, 199, 198, 218, 133, 232, and 185 were all sold, and by 10:15, the price had fallen to 2,580 yuan. Numbers 106, 198, 107, 207, 180, and 71 had a strange desire to buy, and they were pulled back up to 2,670 yuan. Numbers 223, 105, 156, 145, 84, and 171 were sold one after another, and the price fell again to 2,580 yuan. Numbers 24, 223, 198, and 107 once advanced to 2,640 yuan. Numbers 143, 153, 186, 218, 2, 235, and 102 all added to the close. The selling pressure suddenly increased near noon. Matches were sold from number 32 to the limit down, and Deyong Yarn fell to around 2,520 yuan before stabilizing slightly. As a result, Deyong Yarn, Huafeng, Xinguang, Qin Xing, French, and Xinhua all fell slightly compared to the previous close. Xinhe fell by half a percent weakly, and Meiya rose slightly. Settlement prices for Deyong Yarn and Huafeng decreased, Meiya rose slightly, and Xinhe and Xinguang fell by half a percent weakly. Cold stocks such as underwear and matches fell to the limit down. Rongfeng was stable, China Textile fell by less than 10%, Tongyi by less than half a percent, and Guohuo, Jinglun, Cement, Xin Asia, and Yonggong were all weak. The fates of various stocks outside the market were mixed.

### Adulteration of Tobacco Leaves in Tobacco Producing Areas Such as Xuchang

Xuchang and Xiangxian in Henan Province have always been major areas for the production of American tobacco leaves. In recent years, due to the lack of supervision, tobacco farmers have been accustomed to cheating. The amount of tobacco leaves with padding at the bottom of the packages and mixed with impurities accounted for more than 40% of the original weight. As a result, the quality has declined day by day, causing suffering to tobacco firms, tobacco factories, and merchants. The local administrative police commissioner's office, county government, county council, commodity tax bureau, tobacco industry association, and the tobacco production improvement office of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry have all recognized this. They held discussions to ban adulteration and actively improve the situation. After discussions, eight penalty rules for banning adulteration were agreed upon and implemented starting from April 1st.

1.  It is forbidden for tobacco buyers to indiscriminately purchase tobacco leaves with padding at the bottom of the packages and mixed with impurities in the urban and rural areas of this county. If anyone purchases the above-mentioned tobacco leaves, in addition to confiscating 30% of the total value of the adulterated tobacco leaves purchased, they will also be ordered to reorganize the adulterated tobacco leaves purchased.

2.  If tobacco firms purchase tobacco leaves with padding at the bottom of the packages and mixed with impurities on behalf of tobacco buyers, those who commit the offense for the first time will be fined a seven-day suspension of weighing. Those who commit the offense again will be fined a fifteen-day suspension of weighing. Those who commit the offense a third time will be ordered to cease operations, and the tobacco industry association will post a notice at the entrance of the firm.

3.  If tobacco firm tobacco masters purchase tobacco leaves with padding at the bottom of the packages and mixed with impurities on behalf of tobacco buyers, after investigation, those who commit the offense for the first time will be fined 300,000 yuan. Those who commit the offense again will have their tobacco master qualifications revoked, and all tobacco firms will be prohibited from employing them.

4.  If tobacco farmers and tobacco merchants sell tobacco leaves with padding at the bottom of the packages and mixed with impurities, after investigation, in addition to demolishing and burning the bad tobacco on the spot, 3% of the total value of the tobacco leaves sold will also be confiscated.

5.  The County Council, Tobacco Leaf Improvement County Chamber of Commerce, Tobacco Industry Association, and Commodity Tax Bureau will send personnel to conduct detailed investigations at any time. If there are any violations, the names of the buying and selling merchants, the names of the tobacco firms, and the number of catties of mixed tobacco will be recorded immediately. Written evidence from the tobacco firm will be obtained, and the Tobacco Industry Association will be notified immediately to impose penalties in accordance with the regulations. If there is any resistance, the matter will be submitted to the county government for punishment in accordance with the law.

6.  In addition to the personnel sent by the above-mentioned agencies to investigate, anyone may report to the executing agency (the Tobacco Industry Association). After verification, half of the fine will be used as a reward for the informant, and their confidentiality will be maintained.

7.  All of the above fines will be deposited in the county treasury in a special account for local public welfare undertakings.

8.  These penalty rules shall be implemented from the date of promulgation.

### On the "Injustice" of the Medical Practitioner Law

— Butcher

Three years ago, I read an article by Professor Lin Ji criticizing the Medical Practitioner Law in a Chinese medical journal, and since then I have rarely seen any systematic reviews. After the restoration, the Medical Practitioner Law also came to the occupied areas. Everyone felt strange about these two unfamiliar faces at first. In recent years, it has aroused some criticism, especially the most dissatisfaction is the third item of the third article, regarding traditional Chinese medicine, those who have practiced traditional Chinese medicine for more than five years and have outstanding reputations. That is, they are eligible for medical practitioner review. This clearly lowers the qualifications for creating medical talent. Although people in the traditional Chinese medicine community do not feel that this is an insult or discrimination, at least no written dissent from traditional Chinese medicine associations or individuals has been seen in newspapers. Instead, I have seen Western medical associations and individuals with unclear qualifications protest one after another, demanding equal treatment. In other words, those who consider themselves Western doctors, "who have practiced Western medicine for more than five years and have outstanding reputations," should also be able to pass the review. However, the Medical Practitioner Law does not have similar provisions for reviewing non-traditional Chinese medicine doctors. No wonder these people "cry out in injustice."

In fact, the Medical Practitioner Law's qualifications for traditional Chinese medicine review are not the same as those for scientific medicine, which is not a matter of "injustice," but a major stain on Chinese legislation. It is not difficult to imagine how our descendants in a few decades or centuries will resent and ridicule their 20th-century ancestors!

After Taiwan fell into the hands of the enemy, as early as ten years before the Republic of China, the practice of registering traditional Chinese medicine was stopped, and efforts were made to cultivate scientific doctors. By the time the atomic bomb exploded and the enemy surrendered, the Chinese problem in Taiwan had been completely resolved. Smallpox had been eradicated in Taiwan for many years, and the plague in Fujian and cholera in Shanghai had not been able to invade for a long time. However, once restored, Taiwan returned to the embrace of the motherland, and unscientific traditional Chinese medicine and already eradicated epidemics were also restored to their original state.

The Meiji Restoration in Japan was far behind the Chinese in studying Western affairs, but it grasped science, worked hard to advance, and made rapid progress. We always waver on the wrong path of "Chinese learning as the foundation, Western learning as the application." Although the Japanese militarists led their people on the path of militarism, we cannot but admire their knowledge and understanding of science. The steps of the Japanese Meiji Restoration will eventually be the only way for us to strengthen the country. From the perspective of health construction alone, sooner or later China must also adopt the Japanese method of stopping after one-time registration, first solve the problem of unscientific traditional Chinese medicine, and health construction can be free from one obstacle, otherwise health construction will inevitably be delayed, and it may not be possible for hundreds of years. And the failure of health undertakings will inevitably affect the entire nation-building work. What kind of evil consequences will occur? It is truly terrifying!

The Medical Practitioner Law has many shortcomings, but the qualifications for scientific doctors follow the correct path. That is the only thing that is somewhat comforting. It is not difficult to imagine that this is the result of the enlightened people in the legislative officials wanting to preserve a glimmer of hope for the country and fighting for it. I hope that future generations will not forget that there were also some enlightened people among their 20th-century ancestors when they resent you. Especially the health authorities, who can achieve a scientific and upright position,

In the past, those who commented on the Medical Practitioner Law invariably criticized the Ministry of Health for this point. It should be known that it is commendable that the health authorities can barely maintain the standards of scientific doctors. To expect them to be able to argue on the basis of reason, persuade the party and state elders, and immediately imitate the Japanese Meiji Restoration and embark on the road of scientific nation-building is too high a hope.

Some people say, "Our health authorities are not incompetent, but too weak, without backbone." That statement is correct. They lack the support of public opinion and the assistance of backers. They dare not think about what should be done, but only work diligently to do what can be done. They are weak and have no power to resist the power of those elders. But this is also their crime, which descendants a thousand years later will not forgive!

The Medical Practitioner Law needs to be completely overthrown, because it violates science and is not in line with the times. Moreover, the Chinese Constitution has stipulated that a public medical system should be promoted, which is an urgent need for the world trend and national health. It is inevitable in reason and inevitable in trend. Therefore, the Medical Practitioner Law will inevitably be fundamentally revised. Due to space limitations, it will be discussed separately in another article.

### The Mystery of New Chinese Medicine

— A Hong Kong Native

(I) Introduction

What exactly is Chinese medicine? There needs to be a clear answer, as this is a prerequisite for discussing Chinese medicine. However, my asking this question might make some suspect my "ignorance." Chinese medicine is simply Chinese medicine, nothing more to say. True, Chinese medicine is Chinese medicine, but the "theories of Chinese medicine" of the past cannot represent the "practicing Chinese medicine doctors" of today. "Theories" and "people" must be discussed separately; therefore, it is not easy to have a clear and distinct answer. The complexity of Chinese medical theories and the uneven level of practicing Chinese medicine doctors, in all their forms, cannot be summed up in a single sentence. The "theories" of Chinese medicine are "profound yet unsubstantial," but one cannot say that the "people" practicing Chinese medicine are also "profound" yet unsubstantial. In the past, some in the Western medical community made this mistake, believing that because Chinese medical theories were unacceptable, Chinese medicine doctors (people) were also unacceptable. This viewpoint is obviously wrong. We won't concern ourselves with that for now; let's turn back to Chinese medicine itself and see what kind of views they have on the essence of Chinese medicine. It turns out there is much inconsistency. Chinese medicine itself has two contradictions: one is the contradiction in academic theory—the opposition between ancient and contemporary prescriptions; the other is the coexistence of fantasy and experience. As for other contradictions in differentiation and the contradictions in theories on drug properties, anyone who has read Chinese medicine books knows that these contradictions are too numerous to count. Turning any page at random, one is immediately struck by them. In the end, at most, they can only be considered the opinion of one school of thought, not even "officially recognized" by Chinese medicine itself. This is speaking of the "theories" of Chinese medicine in the past. Now, let's look at the "practicing Chinese medicine doctors" of today! They have also never found a correct way out. Needless to say, the complete conservatives are still there, but the inherent theories of Chinese medicine have already gone bankrupt. Therefore, those who are ambitious in Chinese medicine are doing their best to excavate a treasure. When they reach this dead end, reform is imperative. So, from which aspect should they reform? Naturally, it becomes "Westernization!" As usual, the call for Chinese medicine to be Westernized did not begin today. However, after more than ten years of Westernization, there has not been much progress, which is another contradiction of today's practicing Chinese medicine doctors: they have not yet understood the true essence of scientification. It's really laughable. Recently, some people even said, "The scientification of Chinese medicine should not be Westernization" (original text from New China Medicine Monthly, Volume 2, Issue 3). This kind of master-slave mentality seems to imply that "Western medicine" is not "scientific," which is a wonderful argument. Some still believe that Chinese medicine is a synthesis of "science and philosophy" (Mr. Ding Zhongying's words). At the same time, someone named Lu, in an article titled "Experience and Metaphysics" in the Yousheng Medical Journal, said that Chinese medicine has nothing to do with metaphysics or philosophy. They are all Chinese medicine doctors today, yet they contradict each other to this extent. In addition, Mr. Zhang Cigong, who calls himself a traitor to Chinese medicine, says that Chinese medical theory can be completely abolished and that everything from scientific medicine should be accepted. In that case, the "new Chinese medicine" of the future would simply be the application of Chinese herbal medicine by Western medicine. Look at their brilliant arguments, conflicting with each other to this extent. It can be seen that my question "What is Chinese medicine?" is actually "not inappropriate." Whether it is the past or present Chinese medical community, they have never clarified their own essence. How can you expect them to have any improvements? However, it must be said that there are indeed some in the Chinese medical community who can truly be scientified, and these people are quite meticulous. Therefore, Mr. Liu Jingzhou published an article titled "Nagging" in the People's Police Journal last month, saying that he saw several articles in the "publications hosted by the Chinese medicine section of the News Daily" that hardly relied on "Yin-Yang and the Five Elements" to make arguments. Therefore, he expressed great respect for these authors. Indeed, Chinese medicine has progressed. It is a pity that the gentlemen are much more insightful and thorough. As Mr. Pang said, "It's hard to turn around for a while." Although there are many reasons for this, partly due to incomplete thinking and the resistance of conservatives, the fact is that they have not been given the opportunity to "turn around" because most Chinese medicine doctors are not educated enough to learn Western medicine (of course, the stubborn conservatives are excluded). Since Chinese medicine is still Chinese medicine and the government has not provided special facilities to guide their "way out," on the other hand, some in the Western medical community still oppose the scientification of "Chinese medicine" and strongly advocate that Chinese medicine should be allowed to live and die on its own, ignoring it. This is why they want to "turn around" and reform but cannot. Therefore, I hope that the Western medical community will support this group of new Chinese medicine doctors who obey science and guide them onto the right track in order to eliminate this situation of "dualistic medicine" (Mr. Liu Jingzhou's words) where Chinese and Western medicine are in conflict. The future of Chinese medicine is closely related to this. It is not enough to write a few "new terms" in articles. We must also take concrete measures to further provide them with opportunities to supplement their scientific knowledge and improve their clinical application skills. This is the true scientification of Chinese medicine! Okay, this introduction has already been written too long. Below, I will point out the thoughts that represent a part of Chinese medicine, the stumbling blocks that hinder the process of Westernization, and the misunderstandings of the theory of the scientification of Chinese medicine. The question "What exactly is Chinese medicine?" can also be explained incidentally, because this resistance is actually more misleading than the stubbornness of the "orthodox faction" mentioned by Mr. Pang, and it is also essential to expose it.

### A Discussion on Measles (Continued)

— Xie Junshou

(IV) Prevention and Mortality of Measles

As mentioned above, the general prognosis of measles can be said to be good, but it is extremely related to the patient's health condition. For example, patients with tuberculosis, rickets, or whooping cough often have a poor prognosis. Adult measles can sometimes also develop severe symptoms. It is also related to the nature of the epidemic. Often, during a major epidemic in a certain year, there are many deaths. Speaking of mortality, it is very related to age. From statistics, we know that 90% of measles deaths are young children under the age of six. According to the statistics of the city of Frankfurt, Germany, in 1909, the number of measles patients and the death rate per 100,000 people of various ages are as follows:

Number of Patients Number of Deaths

0-1 year 180.0 45.0

1-5 years 637.0 25.0

6-15 years 253.0 1.4

16-20 years 1.0 0.0

20-30 years 3.3 0.1

Over 30 years 0.7 0.0

Furthermore, the mortality rate of measles is related to wealth and poverty. According to Blr-tillon's statistics, the mortality rate per 100,000 people is as follows:

Paris Berlin Vienna

Richest 2.8 9.1 1.1

Poorest 24.3 28.8 13.6

(V) Prevention Methods for Measles

Measles is an infectious disease, and isolation is certainly an important method. If one child in a family develops measles, other children who have not developed measles should be isolated and avoid contact, especially when the nature of the measles is malignant. But in fact, when one child in a family develops it, even if other children avoid contact, it is ineffective, because the measles is already contagious during its incubation period (that is, from four days before the rash appears). Therefore, some people advocate that, except when measles epidemics are malignant, children under the age of three who have glandular diathesis and tuberculosis should be allowed to become infected.

Degkwitx obtained excellent results by using serum from patients in the recovery period of measles, that is, those who have already acquired immunity, to prevent measles. That is, choose measles patients without complications, wait seven to nine days after they have recovered from the fever, take their serum, and inject it into children suspected of being infected to prevent transmission. It is easy to see results five to six days before the end of the incubation period; after seven days, it is ineffective. If there is no serum from patients in the recovery period of measles, using the serum of both parents is also effective. This method is suitable for malignant measles epidemics as mentioned above, as well as for children under three years old who also have tuberculosis and whooping cough, etc.

(VI) Several Important Notes on Caring for Measles

People often focus on medicine when it comes to illness and neglect nursing care; in reality, nursing care is very important. A little carelessness can make a big difference. Now, I will write down the points to pay attention to when caring for measles below:

(1) Keep warm. Everyone knows that warmth is needed for measles. It is best to keep the room temperature at 18 degrees Celsius, but some careless parents let their children get cold. For example, at night, the child accidentally kicks off the blanket, and the cold can easily cause pneumonia.

(2) Keep the indoor air humid. Using a nebulizer to spread water vapor in the room can facilitate the cough and expectoration of phlegm.

### The Problem of Reconstructing the Racecourse

— Hua Lin

The period when the British and French had concessions in Shanghai was indeed a kind of colonial policy, but culturally, it cannot be said that there were no achievements at all. The schools, parks, streets, and buildings built by the Municipal Council also greatly influenced the transformation of the Chinese mainland. This time, when we took over the occupied areas, everyone focused their attention on materials but few people paid attention to culture!

The British and French both had museums and libraries in Shanghai, such as the museum run by the Royal Asiatic Society, which had a rich collection, especially in anthropology, containing many treasures. The skull of "Peking Man," which shocked the world, was also among them. In addition, there were more than 50,000 Western books. On the French side, there was the Aurora Museum, which, in addition to flora and fauna, especially insects, included species that had been studied by the Jesuit Father Heude. The library of the French Association also had tens of thousands of books. These are all achievements left by the British and French, which have been in operation for eighty or ninety years, or at least fifty or sixty years! We should earnestly continue to support these cultural treasures, and international cultural organizations should also provide them with more funding.

The newspaper has previously advocated rebuilding the Shanghai Racecourse into a park, which I think is very reasonable. I also suggest that a World Museum be built in this great park. The museum should mainly display Chinese natural artifacts, and can also ask the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization to solicit cultural relics from various countries. In this way, it is not difficult to create the richest and most beautiful museum in the East. People from Europe and the United States can get a glimpse of the preciousness of Eastern culture when they first arrive in China, and compare it with the cultures of various countries. What a great undertaking this is!

Next to the museum, if the open space is wide and there are sufficient financial resources, a library, a theater, an art gallery, a sports field, a music stage, etc. can also be built. In this way, the old racecourse will become the cultural center of Shanghai. Agricultural and industrial expositions can also be held in the open space, citizen assemblies can be held, and sports competitions, open-air music performances...

Our ideal Shanghai is the most modern garden city in the world, and also the cultural center of East Asia, and the gathering place of world culture. All facilities are built using the latest scientific and industrial technologies, and decorated with the highest forms of literature and art; raising the interests of life, and actively promoting the exchange of human culture, making the international cultural city a glorious city that upholds humanitarianism and justice, just like Athens in ancient Greece. However, Athens symbolizes a narrow patriotic ideology, and does not yet have a sound sense of global harmony!

### A Taste of the Arts

— Pan Boying

In the past, Mei Shengyu had a poem that said: "A wild spirit loves books and paintings, but lacks the strength to acquire them; whenever he meets people of high taste, he always asks to show them." Whenever I recite this verse, I can't help but smile, because it's as if it came from my own mouth. After I saw the precious paintings and calligraphy collected by Zhang Ziboju, because they were all exceptional works, I made a detailed record of them. Ye Xia'an, from Panyu, saw it in the newspaper and also wanted to see them. At the same time, Gu and other gentlemen, friends of Boju, also gathered at Boju's house after seeing the report, and I was able to accompany them several times and browse through them. Among them were some that were not included in the previous record. Therefore, I will re-record them as follows.

1. Zhao Mengfu's Small Script Lotus Sutra Scroll: This is the third volume of the Wonderful Dharma Lotus Sutra written by Songxue. The entire scroll is complete from beginning to end. It is said that Zhao Wuxing's small script is written with a flourish, because it is not only difficult to be neat, but also difficult to be fast. If his brushwork were not so swift, there would definitely not be so many of his small scripts passed down to the world. This scroll is not one of his finest works, but the starting and ending points of the brushstrokes and the turning points are clearly discernible.

2. Zhao Mengfu's Cursive Script Thousand Character Classic: Formerly in the Qing Palace collection, its brocade mounting is already damaged. The paper and ink of this scroll are far better than the previous one. He wrote many Thousand Character Classics, and the one I have seen is the best of them all. His brushwork is round, vigorous, and full of spirit, purely in the style of Zhi Yong, but the structure has many Zhang Cao elements. It seems that he deliberately studied the water master and played tricks to change the structure. After that, Liu Guan's inscription is in the style of Huaisu's cursive script. The inscriptions I have seen are all small regular script characters about half an inch in size. This one is written in cursive script, as if trying to match the drunken monk with Yong Shi. His calligraphy is not very good. Also, on a line at the end of the Thousand Character Classic paper, there is a small square seal in seal script that says "Songxuezhai Tushuji," which is also rarely seen.

3. Wen Zhengming's Fujian Lychee Transplanted to Wu Scroll: This is a work of Hengshan's meticulous interest. The so-called "Fujian Lychee Transplanted to Wu" refers to the preface to the New Lychee Poem composed by Hengshan after the painting, which says, "The Gu family of Changshu moved several lychee trees from Fujian, and they survived after a year. Shen Shitian asked someone to break off a branch to look at it, and the cassia leaves were dense, and he dared not believe it. He showed it to a Fujianese, and it was indeed so! Therefore, he wrote a New Lychee Poem and ordered Bi Tong to compose one as well." After a while, he also did a sketch. This is the Fujian Lychee Transplanted to Wu Scroll. In the past, mountains and rivers were separated, and foreign lands were not visible. That's why "seeing a camel, they thought it was a horse with a swollen back." And "the cassia leaves were dense," which made old man Shitian dare not believe it was lychee. This is what people in Shanghai call "Ama Ling" today. If people like Wen and Shen were born today, with the convenience of air travel, they would arrive in no time. Not only would fresh lychees not be strange, but there would also be people who would use airplanes to carry dogs even when besieged cities were falling! However, although today's dignitaries can use airplanes to carry dogs, no one like Hengshan can paint lychees on silk. This allows Shitian and Hengshan to look down on "Kang Baidu" as "Ama Ling"! Hengshan painted ten branches of Fujian lychee on silk, and the colors are extremely beautiful, all using ancient methods. I recently read Wu Heyu's "Summer Records in Xin Chou," which mentions the lychees painted by Cai Junhan. I have not seen Cai's paintings, so I don't know how wonderful they are. But in this scroll by Hengshan, the branches and leaves are sparse, and the crimson peel is mottled, which is captivating. At the back of the scroll, Hengshan himself wrote a long ancient poem in response to Shen Shitian's New Lychee Poem on paper. The poem is both elegant and the calligraphy is beautiful. There are one or two places where there are typos with annotations. This is exactly what Jiang Baishi meant when he said that he didn't mind the occasional typo.

4. Fang Congyi's Yunlin Zhongxiu Scroll: This Fang Congyi's Yunlin Zhongxiu Scroll is an ink painting on paper. The four characters "Yunlin Zhongxiu" are at the beginning of the painting. At the top of the tail of the painting are the fourteen characters "Hongwu Dingyi Fang Huzi Made as a Gift to Deng Zhi'an Returning to the Court." The four characters "Fang Huzi Hua" are written in the middle of the painting on a high peak like a cliff inscription. All three of these are in the official script. Later, Shen Shitian wrote a poem: "The Shangqing Immortal is originally a celestial being, descending to cultivate the ink relationship. I heard that the moon on the top of the Pipa Ridge shines on the yellow crane returning for thousands of years." I observe that although this painting generally uses the meaning of Mi's cloud mountains, its hills and peaks are steep and the clouds are misty. His brushstrokes in painting clouds are unrestrained and unrestrained, not limited by Mi's method, and signing his name on the top of the hill is also a practice that goes back to the Tang Dynasty. Master Ye Xia'an said that there are several forgeries of this painting. The number of forgeries is imaginable. His words are numerous and cannot be fully recorded. But he believes that this book is genuine.

Also, I have had the opportunity to re-examine Boju's Five Yuan Dynasty Paintings that I mentioned earlier, which are Zhao Zhongmu, Wang Meng, Zhu Zemin, Zhang Gui, and Fang Congyi. In the lower left corner of Zhu Zemin's painting is a small red seal with four characters "Shen Zhou Bao Wan," which is recorded here.

5. Wu Li's Xingfu Temple Nostalgic Painting Scroll: This painting is on silk. It was painted by Wu Yushan in the year of Jia Yin to commemorate his monastic friend, Monk Merong. On it, Yushan wrote by hand that he was a good friend with Monk Merong in writing and painting, and attached two poems of mourning. According to records, Xingfu Temple is in Changshu, and the temple still exists today. In this picture by Yushan, the branches and leaves are falling, the crows are flying and resting, the scripture room is empty and silent, and the solitary crane does not croak. A kind of sad wind and desolate situation can be heard as if there is sound. The ancients said that emotion generates writing, and writing also generates emotion. This painting is intertwined with emotion and writing. Watching it is sad, and it makes people sigh and increase the importance of life, death, and friends. It's a real masterpiece!

6. Qian Shunju's Mountain Dwelling Map Scroll: This volume is on paper. It uses the method of the green and gold landscape of General Li. In its clear green and heavy, there is a kind of clear, leisurely and distant interest, so it is high. Master Ye Xia'an said that he had seen a book with the same meaning, brushwork, and paper crown as this one. This book has no inscription at the back. But the other book has it. The three words "Mountain Dwelling Map" are in front of this book, but not in the other. It is suspected that it is the same book, which was cut into two in the Ming Dynasty. I don't know why. This volume was originally collected by Gao Jiangcun and has its inscription at the end. It was returned to Shao Songnian in the Republic of China. Shao's inscription is several. They are all small and fine regular scripts. Shao's small true script was also quite famous at that time.

7. Mi Youren's Yao Mountain Autumn Study Map Scroll: Zhao Su inscribed at the back of this volume that it was written by Mi Huer. Su's name is Yan Gong, and he is the son of Songxue.

8. Wen Zhengming's Three Friends Picture: Wen Dai Zhao's ink paintings of orchids, chrysanthemums, and bamboo are three scrolls on paper, all with poems. The orchid painting is written in the style of Su Dongpo, and the chrysanthemum is written in the style of Shangu. The bamboo inscription is in his own style. Zhi Liu said that the world has passed on Shen Shitian's paintings in a bold style, and Wen Hengshan has passed on more delicate paintings. Therefore, the world values "rough Wen and fine Shen". Hengshan's three works have a lonely artistic conception, beyond the brush and ink, and are the work of a temporary recreation and self-satisfaction.

9. Song Huizong's Snow River Returning Boat Map Scroll True Work: This is a rare treasure. It was collected by Wang Mengzhou's brothers. When Zhang Jiangling was in the phase, he wanted to take it by force but failed. Such a dramatic work should not be recorded in a hurry. We should wait for a clear window on a sunny day, when the mood is broad and happy, to carefully recognize it.

### The Special Characteristics of Ancient Beauty

— Shen Yan

The history of the pursuit of beauty can be said to have begun simultaneously with the history of mankind. This can be proven not only in the broad sense of cultural archeology, ethnology, and geology, but also clearly demonstrated in various theories of art origins, which could be called the biology of aesthetics, or in sociology and art. In particular, the development of modern art science has increasingly led us to believe that the emergence of beauty occurred in the same period as the emergence of mankind—that is, mankind already possessed the creation of beauty at its inception, although it was extremely naive. We do not need to cite the theories of Groos, Grosse, Philon, Ount, Herrenstein, Habert, Lido, Lalo, and others.

As a result of detailed and meticulous investigations and inferences of the excavations considered to have been created by primitive ancient people, we can know that tens of thousands of years ago on Earth, there were creatures skilled in the working techniques of beauty, at least proto-humans belonging to creatures higher than animals. The existence of proto-humans within the scope of learning can only be inferred from skeletons found in France and Spain, drawings on rocks, bone carvings, and extremely simple paintings with wild cattle as subjects. However, we can easily imagine that these primitive people may have existed not only in these few places but also in Asia and other continents.

That being said, the era was 40,000 to 50,000 years ago, and these so-called most ancient primitive people went through the Paleolithic Age, the Neolithic Age, and the Bronze and Iron Age of metal tools in archeology, the three eras of so-called primitive culture, gradually evolving through various stages. The methods of expressing beauty also differed depending on the race and region. Therefore, it is difficult to provide a general statement on the living conditions or artistic characteristics of primitive people. For example, some races possessed advanced artistic expression and shaping abilities for sculpture or painting, while others only demonstrated some artistic talents in body decoration or dance. Therefore, there are differences in their aesthetic standards or cultural levels.

From a phenomenal perspective, the initial Paleolithic Age involved hunting and nomadic life, the Neolithic Age saw the beginning of agricultural life, and the final Metal Age began with a family life history of gradually using daily utensils.

It was during this period that the initial signs of nomadic life transforming into group life could be discovered. At the same time, it could be known that various forms of aesthetic expression arising from various living conditions would gradually transform into the genuine cultural ancients and ancient life of the next generation—that is, in organized social institutions, ancient peoples and ancient countries created a highly collective art and culture. The uncivilized ancient races, which sociologists or ethnologists call "primitive peoples" or "natural peoples," will evolve into more civilized ancient civilizations; and these more civilized peoples possess organized hunting, fishing, animal husbandry, farming, and the production or invention of stone and metal. From this cultural life, ideals or expressions of beauty that adapt to this life gradually emerge, which are higher-level plastic arts.

From here began the great migration of peoples, and the ancient era took this era as a turning point, jumping from the previous century to the new century and marking out two distinct generations. These new generations of people were no longer unorganized natural peoples, and their art and culture were not as simple as the previous generation. The most ancient yellow-brown races of Asian descent, the Egyptians, Sumerians, and Babylonians, as well as the most ancient white races of European descent, the Greeks, each established ancient states and ancient art.

In this way, a truly decent culture, like art, was formed with the establishment of the state. Among the ancient peoples, the Hamitic Egyptians, the Semitic peoples of Mesopotamia, and the Aryan Greeks, the ancestors of white culture, although slightly earlier or later, built cultural states in roughly the same period, that is, in the ancient era of the ten or several centuries before the Christian era. Here, we can discover the history of ancient society, ancient peoples, and ancient art closely combining and developing.

Beauty in ancient times, in other words, classical beauty, can be said to be a high-level cultural phenomenon that began simultaneously with the rise of these three great peoples. Other ancient peoples of the same era included the Persians, Hebrews, Phoenicians, and the so-called Mediterranean peoples in the archipelago area, as well as the ancient Romans who inherited Greek culture; however, ancient art and culture all originated from the aforementioned three great peoples spanning Africa, Western Asia, and Southern Europe. Therefore, Egypt, Mesopotamia, and Greece can be considered the archetypes of ancient times."

Although the ancient beauty represented by these three great peoples each had its own characteristics, it should be noted that the art and culture of Egypt, Mesopotamia, and Greece have a common and universal aesthetic quality: this universality is that each of the three ancient countries had its own gods, its own service-oriented life goals, and its own fiery ideal of beauty. That is to say, all had myths closely combined with the creative spirit of the nation, temples and statues expressing the divine beauty of ancestor worship; national festivals expressing common joy, symbols of the beauty of national ideals such as the worship of emperors, heroes, or nature, and the service of huge objects derived from them, and their shaping expressions.

After thinking for a moment, Tsurumi instructed the maid to call the embassy and ask when Miss Nakamura would arrive there and if she was still there. If she had left, when did she leave?

The maid agreed and took two steps but turned back and looked at Tsurumi:

"Perhaps Miss Nakamura went to another place?"

"Oh!" Tsurumi stared at the maid. "What makes you think of that?"

"Miss Nakamura was just about to go out when she received a letter. I saw Miss Nakamura read the letter and carefully wrote down some of the words on the letter in a small notebook. Maybe it's a place name?..."

"The letter?... Is it still in Miss Nakamura's room?" Tsurumi became even more uneasy.

"It's probably still in the room. I..."

"Yes, go get it quickly!" Tsurumi waved his hand.

The maid flitted out and immediately rushed back, holding an opened letter in her hand. Tsurumi took the letter and saw that neither side of the envelope had a return address, obviously delivered by someone. Taking out the letter, it was written in Japanese on the stationery:

"Miss Nakamura: Received a telegram informing me of your arrival in the south, but without specifying your Shanghai residence, so I had someone deliver this. If you have time, please come to the Bund Park by the river between 8 a.m. and 4 p.m. and meet someone wearing a white kimono and holding a red Western book. I earnestly request a meeting. Xi Ping."

"Please call first," Tsurumi instructed the maid. The maid responded and left.

"Shanghai is so complex, so powerful! I didn't expect it... " Tsurumi clasped his hands behind his back and paced back and forth in the empty space in the room.

"This is because the captain hasn't been to Shanghai and can't get a handle on things right away; actually, it's not very complex: In the 'Concessions,' apart from the activities of the Chinese military and government, there are only the Green and Red Gangs, which are organized and have more order than the military and government. The Green Gang is the most active, seemingly chaotic, but the highest command can directly reach the lowest level, and as long as there is 'one word,' it is 100% effective..."

"Oh?... There is such a tight organization?" Tsurumi was somewhat skeptical.

"That's due to the traditional superstitious potential created by—Jianghu loyalty—the Chinese current government army used them once when heading north, and they also performed well in the last Zhabei conflict (referring to the January 28th Incident)..."

"This is very interesting..." Tsurumi seemed very attentive.

"The rest are the two Westerner power groups in charge of the 'Concessions'; of course, the captain knows this... But under these power groups, there is also a kind of Sino-foreign organization, which also has a kind of power—relying on Western power on the one hand, and also having some relations with the Green Gang on the other hand—however, the most chaotic is still our side (referring to the Japanese side). So, regarding the Chinese side, you only need to grasp the outline and negotiate with their leaders to understand..."

"The friend you just mentioned, is he someone from these gangs?" Tsurumi remembered Iwasaki's words "ask a friend to inquire."

"Oh!" Iwasaki seemed unable to correct himself. "No, no! That is another mysterious and public organization, the group is very clean; there are only a dozen high-ranking figures."

"What kind of high-ranking figures?" Tsurumi paid even more attention.

"It's hard to explain in a moment," Iwasaki seemed somewhat dazed, "Even his subordinates haven't figured it out. Looking at their actions, it's like ancient kendo swordsmen..."

### ### The Increase of Zero

— Newsboy

Any formula is worthy of learning, but only the increase of zero makes us feel particularly unfortunate. In the past, the increase of zero in personal income was a miracle, but today, when banknotes have grown from single digits to five digits, the measure of life in between cannot be measured in miles. This may be an intolerable error in mathematics, but in reality, as far as we know, the increase of zero is always equal to the number before the zero was increased. You certainly don't admit that a four-digit number can be equal to a five-digit number, because there is one more digit, one more zero; however, on the thermometer of life, we can often make such calculations, drawing an exact equal sign between the four-digit number half a year ago and the five-digit number half a year later.

Perhaps this is a game, a game of numbers.

May everyone be able to stick their head out from the zero, be able to move forward from a string of zeros. Unfortunately, like the infinity of the universe, the increase of zero is also infinite. Such a long-distance race is ultimately exhausting. Overcoming a zero? There is another zero.

As the poem says: When the mountains and rivers are exhausted, you suspect there is no road, but willows are dark and flowers are bright, and there is another village. I am just afraid that although there is a resting place ahead, the one who travels a hundred miles is halfway at ninety, and no one's foot strength can handle this last stretch of time. When it comes to life, we, like Mr. Churchill, think that it is best before 1946. The road after 1946 is the narrowest road, too narrow to accommodate people walking.

Now, there is only such hope, to order the increase of zero: Stop!

### ### A Symbol

— Xin Er

It's "Children's Day" again.

I only found out when I opened the newspaper in the morning. Only then did I think of some feelings, which shows the slowness of my senses. Having Children's Day is obviously a kind of progress, because it shows that we have paid attention to children.

Children's Day will pass in the blink of an eye, but children still exist. I always feel that "Children's Day" is like a kind of grace from adults. It's like elders giving children lucky money, which certainly makes the children happy, but it's mostly a show of face.

If someone says that China since the Republic of China has really made no progress, this statement is certainly infuriating to us.

For example, "Children's Day" certainly did not exist before the Republic of China, but now it does. In fact, this is still something for adults. When adults have no way, they mostly can't even put on a show of face. Therefore, it's hard to say that Children's Day is a kind of progress. However, since it exists, it always counts as paying attention to children. I think children will get better year by year, this is real progress.

I remember that Adam Smith described China in many parts of "The Wealth of Nations." In one place, he said that marriage is rewarded in China, but what is the method of reward? It is the freedom to kill children. In every big city, abandoned babies are found on the streets and alleys every night, or simply thrown into the water. And it is said that there is also a profession that relies on killing babies for food.

It was one hundred and seventy years ago when Adam Smith said these words. And these words still apply to the current Shanghai or all of China.

Adam Smith's original intention is of course quite easy to understand. He is not saying that there is really a law that rewards killing children. In Chinese social ethics, the absolute power of parents reflects the feudal autocratic political system. After marriage, one can become a parent at any time, and once one is a parent, this absolute power comes with it. "Accept small punishments, run away from big punishments." The ancient sages had quite a few teachings on how to be a son.

Smith said quite humorously about "the freedom to kill children" and "professionals," intending to show the stagnation of Chinese society. This is a fact. This stagnation has not stopped even after the Xinhai Revolution and the eight-year War of Resistance. So this phenomenon still exists today.

Smith said a not-so-thorough sentence, saying that although China is stagnant, it has not regressed, because cities abandoned by residents have not been seen.

Residents have certainly not abandoned the cities, but the cities are abandoning the residents. This was really not easy to discern for the old Mr. Smith of one hundred and seventy years ago.

Despite adorning Children's Day, society is actually still stagnant. We have all seen reports of government subsidies for childbearing in the UK and that children in Japan are well-nourished, right? To see the progress or regression of a society, taking how it treats children as a symbol is probably not wrong. (April 4th)

### ### Ye Chucang's Humorous Poems

— Sun Yuehan

Mr. Ye Chucang participated in politics with the status of a poet. He loved wine and was good at poetry all his life, and enjoyed drinking and chanting poems every day. He was friendly with Shao Boqian, Liu Shannong, Wu Lianzhou, and Wu Sanchi. Lianzhou was hunchbacked, Shannong had a pockmarked face, Sanchi was hard of hearing, and Boqian was a dwarf. One day, they gathered for a drink, and Chucang's poetic inspiration suddenly surged. He immediately composed four poems and gave them to his friends. The poem for Liu Shannong said: "Why bother to decorate with powder if you are not beautiful? Even if you decorate with powder, you can't hide it. Marrying a pockmarked face is not a good match, it is no different from a tortoise shell. Leaving traces beyond the beard and eyebrows, with flaws in the mouth and nose. How can it be that you are only greedy for a midday nap under the eaves? The plum blossoms fall on your forehead in the wind?" The poem for Wu Lianzhou said: "Your body seems burdened and your hands seem to carry it, your appearance is truly worthy of lamenting regret; your hunchback is like a new moon, your giant shoulders are like late-blooming rainbows. Although picking things has been convenient, it always feels uneven when you are dressed in blue. May I ask what causes this disfigurement? Why do you always lower your head when you meet people?" The poem for Wu Sanchi said: "You have not become a master, yet the disease has already formed, Heaven is playing tricks too mercilessly. You raise your head to ask repeatedly before you understand, you listen carefully before you understand. To make friends, you must draw words to be humorous, please raise your voice when you talk and laugh. It is said that there is an ancient method of treatment, it is appropriate to drink heavily on the day of the community." The poem for Shao Boqian said: "The most annoying thing in the world is to chant about dwarfs, who is difficult to fill five feet of body. The Chu Kingdom welcomed guests and used dogs to write letters, He Lang played with friends like monkeys; How can Zhong Cuo be a true poet? You are still a small man. Even if you have the talent to pass the imperial examination, how can you avoid ridicule with half a body?" Each poem sings the characteristics of each friend, with humor and laughter, enough to make the hall laugh.

### ### Unemployment Problem

— Yun

According to the Social Bureau's survey, the number of unemployed workers in this city has reached 250,000.

If each unemployed worker originally had to support three wives and children, then one million people in Shanghai will feel the hardship of life and cry for hunger and cold.

This terrible and staggering huge number is truly a hidden worry of society and a source of social crisis!

### ### The Younger Brother is Older Than the Older Brother

— Bai Gao

In this world, there are really many strange and bizarre things. Here, the author will tell you an even stranger thing, that is, the younger brother's age can be older than the older brother's.

We know that there is a date line in the Pacific Ocean, which, according to geography, is the meridian of 180 degrees east and west longitude. In fact, this line is not drawn straight, because it avoids the land. Passing through this line will skip twenty-four hours. For example, if you pass this line from east to west on December 31, it will be January 2 of the following year. It can be said that you have missed the New Year's Day of the past year, but the end of December 31 and the beginning of January 2 are connected, and there is no missing page on the calendar.

If a pregnant woman is on a ship crossing the Pacific Ocean from China to the United States, and she happens to give birth to a boy when passing this date line, suppose it is at 12 o'clock on January 1, 1947, and then gives birth to a twin brother fifteen minutes later, this little brother's birthday is December 31, 1946. Isn't the younger brother's age older than the older brother's?

On New Year's Eve of 1946 on one side of the date line, music celebrating New Year's Day of 1947 was received by radio. Conversely, you can hear the songs of last year again this year. Someone died on December 31, but someone saw him alive on New Year's Day of the following year. These are all tricks played by the date line.

### ### Record of a City in Danger

— Qin Shouou

Old Zhu had already heard something from Xu Fatty about her and Old Zhu, but he had always had only a kind of contemptuous pity for this indecisive woman and did not care about her, so he did not investigate further.

"I want to go to the Art Museum, but it's not certain yet." He told her frankly.

"Then how about treating me to some snacks? I'm leaving tomorrow!" She moved her body closer to Old Zhu and said softly.

Old Zhu glanced at her. Jin Aili was looking at him with a pleading expression.

"Okay! Where do you want to go?"

A look of excitement suddenly appeared on the other person's face.

"Hot bread on Fengbei Road, do you like to eat it?" Her voice was even more charming.

Old Zhu nodded, grabbed her and dived into the car.

"This is probably the chairman's racing car, right?" He said jokingly.

Jin Aili smiled shyly, her ears were a little red, and she didn't answer. Old Zhu didn't ask further.

The Guangdong store selling hot bread and soy milk had very little business, and people were eager to flee, even their appetites were reduced.

"The rumors are very tight, don't you want to leave yet?" Jin Aili asked very concerned.

Old Zhu was drinking soy milk like crazy.

"Really, I'm not lying to you! Yesterday, Old Zhu and the others said that a special plane from Li Gongguan had also flown away, the situation is really wrong!" Jin Aili emphasized again.

"But, we can't leave even if we want to!" Old Zhu shook his head, still with a playful smile. "They want people to take airplanes, you rich people take cars, and people with thicker legs take trains, what about us? We can only fight to save our legs, and talk about it when we really want to escape!"

Jin Aili was eating a piece of bread smeared with butter elegantly. After hearing Old Zhu's words, she also felt a little sad and unhappy.

"Old Zhu!" She moved her head closer to Old Zhu's shoulder and said in a very low voice: "Do you need money?"

Zhu Zhaonian almost laughed out loud.

"Someone said Old Zhu gave you a lot of US dollars, is that true?" He asked her back, but did not look at her.

The person being asked's cheeks were completely flushed, she lowered her head and said nothing; after a while, her eyes were full of tears.

Old Zhu didn't pay attention to her, picked up a steaming round bread and swallowed it in big bites. (36)
