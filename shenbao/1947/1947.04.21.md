[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 20th] At the invitation of Chairman Chiang, Xu Fulin, the Minister of Propaganda of the Democratic Socialist Party, arrived in Nanjing from Shanghai at 2:00 PM on the 20th, accompanied by Yang Junming. Chairman Chiang invited Xu to a casual meal at 8:30 PM, accompanied by Secretary-General Wu Tiecheng. According to Xu, the Chairman hoped that he would take a position as a government commissioner, but he believed that although the title of government commissioner was very high, there was no actual work to do. The Chairman mainly hoped that he would come out to help. Xu said, "Of course, otherwise I would not participate in the National Assembly. I would not advocate participating in the government, but to help, there must be something to do, so I cannot answer tonight and will consider it further." Xu also said that before he came to Nanjing, Zhang Junmai had instructed him to discuss the modification of Article 1 and Article 15 of the National Government Organization Law with the Chairman. Tonight, the Chairman agreed that Article 15 could be deleted, while Article 1 was based on Article 77 of the Provisional Constitution and did not need to be changed. Regarding the Democratic Socialist Party's participation in the Executive Yuan, Xu said that he and most of the members of the Standing Committee of the party shared the same opinion, that is, they advocated participating in ministries, not just as ministers without portfolio. It is also learned that Wu Xianzih is scheduled to fly from Hong Kong to Shanghai on the 23rd.

[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, 20th] Zhang Junmai recently sent a letter to the Chairman, explaining the opinions of the Democratic Socialist Party and the Youth Party on the allocation of seats for National Assembly representatives, legislators, and supervisors, hoping to occupy a certain proportion in the above-mentioned various elections.

### The Internal Strife of the Democratic Socialist Party Has Come to an End

Li Daming Clarifies His Position

[News from This Newspaper] Secretary-General Lei Zhen arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning. When interviewed by reporters, he said that he came to Shanghai to attend the board meeting of the Xinhua Art Society, not to mediate the internal strife of the Democratic Socialist Party as rumored. However, he had met with people from both sides for convenience. According to his personal opinion, the internal strife of the Democratic Socialist Party is not as serious as rumored. It is only that one side believes that since the Standing Committee has decided to fully participate in the government, the ministries of the Executive Yuan should also be included. Lei said: The Democratic Socialist Party's non-participation in the ministries is temporary, and it is expected to join soon. The current situation is unlikely to affect the Democratic Socialist Party's established plan to participate in the government. This matter is an internal issue of the Democratic Socialist Party, and it is not easy for outsiders to speak, and from the standpoint of a third party, I am unwilling to offend either side. At the same time, the internal strife has been around for a long time, and it is not something that I can mediate in a short period of time. It is heard that Wu Xianzih will come to Shanghai today. In this way, all the key members of the Democratic Socialist Party will meet together, and all problems can be easily solved by themselves. Regarding the amendment of the National Government Organization Law, Lei said that the two parties did not demand that the Chairman be responsible to the two parties as rumored, so the problem is not difficult to solve, and Nanjing is expected to make a decision on this today.

[Central News Agency, This City] Tang Xiangming and others of the Democratic Socialist Party recently used the names of Zhang Dongsun, Wu Xianzih, and Li Daming to publish a letter to Chairman Chiang, a letter to Zhang Junmai, and a public statement, accusing Zhang Junmai of launching a "purge movement," and their words and deeds were extreme, which aroused the disgust of enlightened people inside and outside the party. Zhang Dongsun has denied participating in the matter, and Li Daming also telegraphed from Honolulu yesterday to clarify his position. The original telegram is as follows: "Mr. Zhang Junmai, I have received your telegram. My proposal for full participation has been stated in the previous telegram. At that time, everyone acknowledged the list of government commissioners passed by the Standing Committee, and there was no denial of it, and there was no signing. My name was included in the statement by Baoguan and others. I did not know about it beforehand, and there was no consent. Daming." Hao (19th). According to the public statement issued by Tang Xiangming and others, Wu Xianzih's name was signed. It is said that Li Daming signed it on his behalf. Now that Li has telegraphed to deny it, then Wu's name is also a forgery, which is obvious.

[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, 20th] The Nanjing General Branch of the Democratic Socialist Party held its founding meeting at the party's Nanjing office at 3:00 PM on the 20th. More than 60 chairmen of various branches attended. Jiang Yuntian attended to give guidance. Shen Zhenglun served as the temporary chairman.

### Lin Biao Died After Being Assassinated; "Mayor" of Harbin Li Tianyou Was Executed

According to reliable sources: when the Communist Northeast Army commanders met at the headquarters of Lama Terrace in Nangang, Harbin, on March 28, Lin Biao advocated invading south again. The mayor of Harbin, Li Tianyou, strongly opposed it and advocated breaking away from Mao Zedong and cooperating with the government. They could not agree with each other, and there was a firefight.

### Taiwan Provincial Garrison Headquarters Announces Further Shortening of Curfew Hours; Increasing Number of People in Tainan Surrendering Weapons

[Central News Agency, Taipei, 20th] The compatriots of Taiwan are extremely interested in the reorganization of the central government. They once hoped that the central government would be reorganized quickly.

### American Expert on Chinese Affairs Discusses the Reorganization of Our Government; Says the Spirit of Democracy Is Universally Celebrated

[Central News Agency, Washington, 19th] Washington generally expresses satisfaction with the Chinese National Government's reorganization of drawing in people from other parties and non-party members, and Chairman Chiang's leniency towards the Chinese Communist Party. The White House has not yet made any comments on the establishment of a Chinese coalition government. Acting Secretary of State Acheson publicly expressed his support for the new members joining the Chinese government, saying that the United States knows these people very well and that they are highly admired by Americans. The White House is waiting for the Secretary of State to return from Moscow before the U.S. government can formally reflect on the new Chinese government. One of the very few experts on Chinese affairs in the U.S. Congress, Congressman Judd, told a reporter from the Central News Agency today that Chairman Chiang's continued efforts to democratize China with an indomitable spirit should be universally celebrated. Judd continued, The government reorganization held in Nanjing this week has made Americans believe that Chairman Chiang has always worked hard to the best of his ability to make China move towards improving the government and expanding the government as soon as possible. fact Judd believes that given the enormous challenge of changing thousands of years of authoritarian rule into a republic, Chairman Chiang's forward movement is actually faster than any rational person would have expected. Judd firmly believes that China has encountered many obstacles, because China has been invaded by Japan in the past, the Communist fifth column in China has been secretly sabotaging, and there is Soviet communism, as well as misunderstandings and interventions from Western countries. Judd criticized some people who slander Chairman Chiang's one-party rule in a satirical tone, saying that these people are quite tainted with red. Judd accused that these critics are accustomed to using "slanderous tricks" to accuse Chairman Chiang of one-party rule, but they are incapable of seizing control of the government for themselves. Judd continued in an interrogative tone, Is it that any other country has sent leaders of the Communist Party and other minority parties to attend the San Francisco United Nations Conference? It is heard that the United States has not sent Communist representatives to attend UN meetings. I have read through history and it is difficult to find a greater example of Chairman Chiang's vision, breadth of mind, and adherence to justice in reorganizing and expanding the central government. Judd intends to appeal to Congress to pay attention to the end of the one-party government in China, and requires the leaders of Congress to make efforts for China and not for the Soviet Union. American Special Committee for Investigating National Defense Plans Chairman Proster told reporters from the Central News Agency that he was "very satisfied with the progress made in this direction and hopes that this means that the United States will adopt a more stable policy to support the Chinese government." He said that Washington will adopt a more assertive policy to support the Chinese government. A reporter from the Central News Agency also requested Powell, a leading figure in Congress who claims to sympathize with the left, to comment on the reorganization of the Chinese government. He declined to comment, saying only that he did not fully understand the new government and therefore could not comment at this time, but he promised to issue a formal statement to the Central News Agency within the next week, but he said that he was willing to do his best to maintain the friendship between the United States and China. An observer told a reporter from the Central News Agency that when the new reorganization of the Chinese government is fully understood, American sympathy for China will undoubtedly turn into something more practical. Unfortunately, only a few people are currently observing the importance of this reorganization, and only a few people are paying attention to recent developments. It is rumored that the future development of U.S. loans to China must be decided after Marshall returns to the United States. In fact, U.S. policy toward China is often determined by Marshall, because he has close ties to China. Over the past week, American politicians have been busy solving many of their own urgent problems. Such as labor, legislation, the telephone strike, the recent loan plan, the Texas explosion, the debate on the World Relief Fund, and the Moscow Conference.

### Gong Xuesui Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday

### British Economist Weekly Praises Our Diplomatic Policy

[Central News Agency, London, 19th] The influential British weekly "The Economist" published a long article today, analyzing the political conflict in China, concluding with high praise for the National Government, which, while dealing with internal strife, still adopted a tough diplomatic policy. The National Government raises the banner of nationalism, and at the same time, when the National Government insists on China's dignity in international forums, it has almost united the people of the whole country under its leadership. The government, in particular, has won the support of all politically sensible Chinese people when it resolutely protested the Four Foreign Ministers meeting discussing China's internal affairs, with the exception of the most fanatical Communist elements. The weekly also pointed out that the Chinese government has also adopted a tough approach to the discriminatory measures against overseas Chinese by the Philippine government and the Indonesian government. This strength in protecting overseas Chinese can fully prove that internal strife has not made China powerless internationally.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 19th] U.S. Congressman Mansfield recently told reporters that the current reorganization of the Chinese government is indeed a step in the right direction. He said that the expanded foundation of the Chinese government indicates that Chairman Chiang wants to make the government a more representative government of the Chinese people. He said that Zhang Qun's appointment as the President of the Executive Yuan was an excellent choice, and he could not think of a more outstanding leader than Zhang Qun, the former chairman of Sichuan Province, whom he had met when he came to China at the behest of Roosevelt in the early years of the war. He feels the same way about Sun Ke.

### Allied Headquarters Orders Japanese Government to Repay Allied Nationals' Property; Stipulates Implementation from November of Last Year

[United Press Tokyo, 20th] Brigadier General Tansee, Director of the Civilian Property Administration of the Allied Headquarters, stated here that the Far Eastern Commission's principle of interim restitution for the Japanese confiscation of Allied property within Japan has been implemented. The Allied Headquarters has formally ordered the Japanese government to repay the property of United Nations nationals, stipulating implementation from November of last year to further the accomplishment of this occupation task.

According to the Far Eastern Commission's order, any identifiable property, tangible or intangible, of any national of the United Nations that was within Japan before the outbreak of war between that country and Japan, or acquired lawfully at that time or thereafter, and which was formally or informally occupied, confiscated, or concealed by the Japanese government, members of the Japanese armed forces, Japanese officials and private citizens or organizations, or officials, private citizens, or organizations of other enemy countries, shall be repaid.

The Far Eastern Commission considers that all property obtained from United Nations nationals by the Japanese government or other enemy governments, armed forces, or peoples of those countries during the war, whether or not payment was made at the time, shall be considered "confiscated." Allied nationals shall not bear the cost of repaying the property. The Far Eastern Commission's order also defines "outbreak of war," stipulating that the time of outbreak of war for each Allied nation is December 7, 1941, but for China, it is July 1937, and for France, it is September 12, 1940.

According to Brigadier General Tan's statement, the current restitution of assets only applies to individuals currently in Japan, charitable and religious organizations operated by foreign companies with resident general managers in Japan, and enterprises owned by United Nations nationals residing in Japan. The restitution problem for United Nations nationals not residing in Japan will soon be implemented in accordance with the principle of the Allied Headquarters to accelerate the accomplishment of the occupation task.

The Far Eastern Commission's order stipulates that only small-scale industrial and commercial organizations will be repaid at present, while large-scale factories are not included, and may be part of a reparations plan in the future.

### Taiwan to Establish Cooperative Farms; Land Policy Now the Focus of Provincial Administration; Will Eliminate the Middle Class That Exploits Farmers

[This Newspaper Taipei, 20th] The land policy of the province has now become the focus of the Public Office's administration. Chief Executive Chen intends to solve the land problem as a test of realizing the Three Principles of the People. He told reporters from this newspaper that the outside world has little understanding of the land in this province. Public land accounts for 70%, and private land accounts for 30%. Of the 70%, including mountains, barren hills, rivers, airports, etc., only 23% is actually occupied. Of this percentage, only one-fifth is arable land, which is not a large amount. At present, the Public Office has decided to use this land to operate cooperative farms, divided into primary and advanced types, with a total of more than 180, under the responsibility of the Cooperative Business Committee. The rent collected is lower than that stipulated by the Land Law, and the maximum amount does not exceed one-quarter of the harvest. Zhou Yie, Director of the Department of Civil Affairs, said: "The main purpose of building farms now is to reduce labor, increase harvests, and lower rents. The middle class that exploited farmers in the past will be completely eliminated. It is estimated that the annual income will exceed 700 million yuan."

### Our Consul General in San Francisco, Zhang Zichang, Talks About the Situation of Overseas Chinese; Government Should Pay Attention to Enhancing the Political Status of Overseas Chinese

[Central News Agency Nanjing, 20th] Zhang Zichang, Consul General in San Francisco, was summoned back to the country to report on his work. He arrived in Nanjing from Shanghai on the 19th and met with a reporter from the Central News Agency to talk about the situation of overseas Chinese in San Francisco. Zhang said: "At present, there are about 20,000 overseas Chinese living in San Francisco, most of whom are engaged in business. The most are those who run restaurants and grocery stores. During the war, the San Francisco market was prosperous due to the concentration of soldiers and tourists, and overseas Chinese businesses also benefited. After the end of the war, various industries were slightly affected. Among the 20,000 overseas Chinese currently living in San Francisco, including those born in the United States, 7,000 have acquired US citizenship. However, all overseas Chinese love and care for their motherland. During the war, many overseas Chinese served in the US military or participated in wartime production work, making great contributions to the front and rear. All of this is enough to promote understanding and communication between the Chinese and American nations." Zhang continued: "Chinatown in San Francisco has gradually expanded recently. The schools run by overseas Chinese include Jianguo Middle School, Shanhua School, and several primary schools run by various guild halls and churches. In addition to receiving education in American public elementary schools, school-age overseas Chinese children can also learn Chinese characters in the above-mentioned schools. There are several newspapers, including China Youth Morning Post, National Daily, Jinshan Times, Sino-Western Daily, and World Daily. In terms of population, the newspaper industry is more developed than in China." Zhang finally said: "At present, the problems that the government should pay attention to are how to export Chinese goods to the United States to increase the value of exports and facilitate the needs of overseas Chinese, and how to enhance the political status of overseas Chinese in the United States. The latter depends on the unity of overseas Chinese and the ability to use the right to vote well. In the recent election, only about 3,000 overseas Chinese and American citizens of Chinese descent voted in San Francisco."

### The Late Chairman Lin's Estate to Be Auctioned; Lin Sen Vocational School Established in His Hometown; All Estate to Be Valued and Exhibited in the Capital

[This Newspaper Nanjing, 20th] Ms. Lin Chen Shaohua, the widow of the late Chairman Lin, is currently in Nanjing presiding over the liquidation of his estate and, in accordance with his will, auctioning off all of his estate to establish the Lin Sen Vocational School in Shanggan Township, Fuzhou, his hometown. A reporter visited Ms. Chen today at the former residence of the late Chairman Lin at No. 5 Ruyi Lane, Beiting Lane, Nanjing. Ms. Chen was simply dressed and often told that the house was also on the auction list. When the reporter asked about her future whereabouts, Ms. Chen said: "I have not yet considered this point, because I remember that the late Chairman Lin often said: 'Leaving money to ten grandchildren is useless if they cannot use it; leaving books to children and grandchildren is also useless if they cannot read.' We are ordinary people, only seeking to be fed and clothed, and have no extravagant hopes, so selling the house is to comply with the will. As for our future whereabouts, it has not been decided yet, but most of us will return to Beiping, because the late Chairman Lin hoped that his children and grandchildren would stay in Beiping, the city of culture, so we have lived in Beiping for a long time." In addition, the late Chairman Lin has four grandchildren, one of whom is a granddaughter. The eldest grandson, Lin Tao, is in Fujian.

Editorial

### The Final Stage of the Moscow Conference

The Moscow Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference has already been going on for over a month since it opened on March 10th. During these forty days, all that has been seen at the Aviation Club is one wave after another, with arguments and debates raging; not only has there been no progress on the agenda that the four powers had set before the conference, but now it seems that the Foreign Ministers Conference may end in discord. According to a Moscow dispatch from the French press on the 19th, observers generally expect the Moscow Conference to close in the next day or two (the 22nd or 23rd), with a resumption of the Foreign Ministers Conference in July. In the past few days, there have been rumors that US Secretary of State Marshall and British Foreign Secretary Bevin would be leaving the Soviet Union to return to their countries within the next week; today, there are reports that the British and French delegations have made preliminary preparations to leave. Even Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, after forty days of verbal warfare, feels exhausted. If the above news is true, then not only will the basic points of the German peace treaty not be agreed upon, but also the Austrian peace treaty, due to the unresolved issues of German assets in Austria and the demands of southern countries on Austria, will not be signed in Moscow. The failure of the four powers to reach an agreement on the German issue will have a serious impact on the future international situation, but all parties had already anticipated this before the conference. However, the failure to sign the Austrian peace treaty in Moscow is a great psychological blow to the world.

Since returning to the United States from China to take office as Secretary of State, Marshal Marshall has been deeply studying the post-war international situation, especially the relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union; deeply aware of the crux of the problem, he resolutely went to Moscow to attend the Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference, hoping to use his military strategy and political wisdom to shed a ray of sunshine on post-war peace. Therefore, before heading to Moscow, Marshal Marshall had three main goals in mind: (1) to agree on the main points of the German peace treaty and decide on the date for convening the German peace conference; (2) to sign the Austrian peace treaty in Moscow; (3) to conclude a Four-Power Pact to guarantee that Germany would be disarmed and would not rise again to commit aggression. However, Marshal Marshall, observing the general trend of the world, also knew that his mission would not be easy to accomplish. Therefore, on his way to the Soviet Union, Marshal Marshall made a speech stating: "The work of the Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference is extremely difficult, and the German peace treaty may not be drafted during the conference. The purpose of this conference is only to reach an agreement on the basic points of the German peace treaty. If this goal can be achieved, I will be very pleased." From this statement, it is clear that the "fruitless" outcome of the Foreign Ministers Conference was already within Marshal Marshall's expectations.

Let's look again at how Marshal Marshall has maintained a calm and adaptable attitude throughout these four thousand days of the conference, always wanting to prevent this Foreign Ministers Conference from being "in vain." Initially, Marshal Marshall remained silent, listening quietly to the lofty discussions of the British, French, and Soviet Foreign Ministers. Only when it came to critical junctures or unresolved disputes did Marshal Marshall change his attitude of silence and present his arguments. The intention of this approach was simply to ensure the smooth progress of the Foreign Ministers Conference. However, Marshal Marshall's approach failed to change the atmosphere of the conference. Foreign Minister Molotov consistently adhered to his preconceived notions and was unwilling to budge. When the United States proposed the conclusion of a Four-Power Pact, the Soviet Union even proposed amendments that made it fundamentally impossible to establish. Marshal Marshall had no choice but to seek another path, attempting to break the stalemate between the United States and the Soviet Union, and requested a direct meeting with Stalin. However, the result of the Stalin-Marshall meeting did not produce any new effects, and the stalemate of the Foreign Ministers Conference remained unbroken. Therefore, Marshal Marshall has indeed made his greatest efforts in the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference; the failure to break the stalemate of the conference can be seen as a failure of Marshal Marshall's diplomacy.

We summarize the opinions expressed by the four powers in the past forty days and find that the divergence of opinions among the four powers has indeed reached its peak: (1) Regarding the issue of disarming Germany and clearing Germany's war potential, the Soviet Union attacked the British and American occupying authorities for failing to comply with the provisions of the Potsdam Agreement and effectively disarming Germany and destroying Germany's war potential; the British Foreign Secretary retorted, and Marshal Marshall also defended the Allied Control Council. (2) Regarding the issue of purging the remnants of Nazism in Germany to achieve political democratization, the United States advocated that the same methods should be adopted in the four occupation zones; France expressed its agreement, but believed that German politics must first be democratized before the remnants of Nazism can be purged; the British and Soviet Foreign Ministers, however, accused and attacked each other. (3) Regarding the issue of German reparations, the Soviet Union demanded $10 billion in reparations from Germany, and that the reparations be extracted from Germany's current production; Britain and the United States firmly opposed this; France expressed its agreement in principle. (4) Regarding the issue of German economic unification, the Soviet Union strongly advocated unification and demanded that Britain and the United States abolish the agreement signed on the economic merger of the two occupation zones; France, on the other hand, made the condition that it would accept German economic unification if the quantity of German coal imported into France was increased. (5) Regarding the issue of the German central government, Britain and the United States advocated that Germany adopt a federal system, but the Soviet Union favored Germany becoming a unified country. (6) Regarding the issue of the resettlement of German refugees, France believed that its own population was already very dense, and did not allow people to continue to move to Germany, and that non-Germans should not be allowed to reside in Germany; Britain expressed its disagreement. (7) Regarding the issue of the Ruhr area, the Soviet Union advocated joint management by the four powers, Britain demanded that the joint management method of the four powers should extend to the entire Germany; France, on the other hand, demanded that a special political system be established in the Ruhr area, which was again opposed by Britain. (8) Regarding the issue of German borders, the United States proposed returning Upper Silesia to Polish jurisdiction, and the areas occupied by Poland in eastern Germany should be returned to Germany. Molotov insisted that the German-Polish border should be divided in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement. Naturally, he expressed his opposition. Britain and France unanimously believed that: "Germany's borders were too far east after the First World War; and after the Second World War, they will be too far west." (9) Regarding the issue of the Four-Power Pact, Britain, the United States, and France unanimously supported it, but Molotov proposed amendments that made it impossible to establish. (10) Regarding the issue of the Austrian peace treaty, all issues have been resolved, but on the issue of German assets in Austria, the opinions of the United States and the Soviet Union are completely opposite. The Soviet Union's proposal is tantamount to making Austria bear some reparations. (11) Regarding the issue of convening a German peace conference, "the United States advocated that, in accordance with the spirit of the United Nations Charter, all countries that had been at war with Germany should participate in the German peace conference, but in the voting at the conference, the countries should be divided into two categories: those with voting rights and those without voting rights." The Soviet Union expressed its disagreement with this.

From the above, we can understand the outline of the US-Soviet dispute. Standing as a third party, and speaking fairly, the United States and the Soviet Union are consistent in principle and in understanding on how to deal with this defeated Germany; there is no difference between them; everyone wants to disarm Germany, purge the Nazi forces in Germany, and make its politics democratic, so that it can no longer rise again to threaten the peace and security of Europe; if the United States and the Soviet Union can both prioritize peace and not obsess over their own interests, then the Foreign Ministers Conference will not find it difficult to reach an agreement on these issues. However, the reason why there is so much controversy now, even to the point of bringing the conference to a standstill, is entirely due to the deep-seated prejudices of the four powers, especially the irreconcilable differences between the United States and the Soviet Union. Looking out at the world, not only is the sky in Moscow shrouded in haze; but also between the United States and the Soviet Union, there is a fog of suspicion and gloom. These days, the Security Council is discussing the US aid plan for Greece and Turkey, making the shores of Success Lake a gloomy world. Therefore, the mutual suspicion and mutual fear between the United States and the Soviet Union is a major tragedy of today's world; the fundamental reason for the difficulty in achieving post-war peace lies in this; the reason why the Moscow Conference has come to a standstill also lies in this. Therefore, Moscow observers say that only if the opinions of the United States and the Soviet Union suddenly converge can the Foreign Ministers Conference continue; otherwise, it will end in discord. Therefore, we hope that the politicians and diplomats of the United States and the Soviet Union will quickly use their political wisdom to dispel the clouds in the Moscow sky and shed a ray of sunshine on peace before it ends in discord.

In short, the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference has reached its final stage, and success or failure will be known within the next week; all peace-loving people around the world are looking up at Moscow, hoping that the Foreign Ministers of the four powers will spread some news of peace, and not disappoint them again.

### Preamble to Austrian Peace Treaty Passed, But Foreign Ministers Conference Still Not Optimistic; Opinions of Four Powers on Southern Country's Demands Widely Divergent

[United Press, London, 20th] Moscow Radio announced today that the entire preamble to the Austrian peace treaty was adopted by the Foreign Ministers Conference at its meeting on Sunday morning.

[Our Newspaper] Moscow, 20th - The four Foreign Ministers today discussed the Austrian peace treaty twice and reached an agreement. Molotov originally insisted that war criminals could be arrested in Austria without presenting evidence, but he has now abandoned this position. The British, American, and French Foreign Ministers believe that evidence should be presented before arresting war criminals in Austria, and Molotov has now agreed to this point. Apart from this, no agreement has been reached on any other important clauses.

[Associated Press, Moscow, 20th] Today's Foreign Ministers Conference, starting from the peace treaty, discussed the remaining eight clauses one by one, and re-examined the entire treaty. Except for the point on war criminals, no agreement was reached on any other key points. The second meeting of the four Foreign Ministers, originally scheduled for today, was temporarily canceled to give the Foreign Ministers' representatives an opportunity to work, but they agreed to hold two meetings tomorrow. In the morning, they will discuss the Trieste economic report, and in the afternoon, they will listen to the representatives' reports on Austria. The four Foreign Ministers also agreed that the Austrian peace treaty will not use the official German text. This was proposed by French Foreign Minister Bidault, and the other three Foreign Ministers said that they had "no strong feelings" about it.

[Our Newspaper] San Francisco, 20th - The British, American, and French Foreign Ministers have rejected Yugoslavia's demand for territory from Austria. The three Foreign Ministers believe that Carinthia should not belong to Yugoslavia.

[Reuters, Moscow, 19th] Today's Foreign Ministers Conference discussed Yugoslavia's territorial demands on Austria and failed to reach an agreement, so it was decided to hand it over to the Deputy Foreign Ministers' meeting for further study, with a report to be submitted on Monday. In order to accelerate the discussion, the four Foreign Ministers decided to hold two meetings tomorrow, Sunday, exceptionally, both long and late. Yugoslavia's demands were supported only by Molotov. When discussing Yugoslavia's demand for reparations from Austria, Foreign Secretary Bevin revealed the secret historical record of the Potsdam Conference's decision not to demand reparations from Austria. At that time, the Soviet representative proposed that Austria should pay industrial products worth $250 million to the United Kingdom, the United States, the Soviet Union, and Yugoslavia within six years from 1945. This was on July 24, 1945. However, the Economic Committee of the Potsdam Conference received the proposal for the first time and did not reach an agreement. Later, the Foreign Ministers of the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union studied the matter in Potsdam, and then submitted it to the three giants, Churchill, Stalin, and Truman, who finally reached a resolution agreeing not to demand reparations from Austria, and explicitly stipulated it in the Potsdam Agreement. Molotov still demanded consideration of Yugoslavia's demands on Austria. Bidault agreed with the British and American proposals in principle, but he also stated that France did not participate in the Potsdam Conference, but he was deeply moved by the opinions expressed by the Yugoslav Foreign Minister on Thursday, so he felt he did not know whether we could revoke Article 45 of the Austrian treaty to satisfy Yugoslavia's demands. This article stipulates that Austrian property within the United Nations or the proceeds from clearing such property should be returned to Austria. Bidault believed that Yugoslavia had suffered severe damage from the Austrians during the war, and could obtain some compensation by revoking the previous article. As for France, it still intends to return Austrian property within its territory, and wants other United Nations countries to be prepared to do so as well. It was finally decided that Article 45 of the Austrian treaty would be handed over to the Deputy Foreign Ministers' meeting for study in accordance with Bidault's proposal. The four Foreign Ministers then discussed Austria's borders. The United Kingdom, the United States, and France favored retaining the Austrian borders before the German annexation of Austria, while Molotov supported Yugoslavia's demand for part of the land in Carinthia Province. Marshall said that Yugoslavia's demands could not be accepted under any circumstances, so as not to seriously damage Austria's economy.

### It is rumored that the Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference will close this week; the next conference may be convened in July

[French News Agency, Moscow, 19th] Observers here recently said that the Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference is likely to close on the 22nd or 23rd of this month, and to be convened in July of this year. Some observers have made this prediction based on the fact that the British and French delegations are currently making preliminary preparations to return to their countries. For example, previous residents of the Moscow Hotel have received notices that they can expect to move back into the hotel around April 25th. At present, only key members of the US delegation remain optimistic, or pretend to be optimistic, and say that the Foreign Ministers of the four countries will continue to meet for two or three weeks. But to make the Foreign Ministers Conference extend its session, a major miracle must occur, namely: (1) The views of the United States and the Soviet Union on the Four-Power Pact can converge; (2) The Soviet Union's hope to extract reparations from Germany's current industrial production can be reconciled with the hope of the United Kingdom and the United States to restore German industry to reduce their responsibility; otherwise, there is no hope for extending the conference. US Secretary of State Marshall made a final effort today, attempting to probe the Soviet Union's intentions, but the Soviet Union, disregarding the opinions of the three Foreign Ministers on the Austrian border issue and the reparations issue, insisted on its preconceived notions and was unwilling to budge. Marshall now fully understands that the Soviet Union cannot concede, even at the cost of not signing the Austrian peace treaty in Moscow. In short, the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference is bound to adjourn, which is a major failure for Marshall. The mistake lies in the fact that Marshall directly attacked the Soviet Union on issues that the Soviet Union cannot concede (the reparations issue and the German-Polish border issue). This is what led to this result.

### Stalin Receives Deputy Prime Minister of Southern Country

[French News Agency, Moscow, 19th] Moscow Radio recently issued a message stating that Marshal Stalin received Yugoslav Deputy Prime Minister Kardelj today for discussions. Yugoslav Ambassador to the Soviet Union Popoviƒá and Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov were also present.

### British, American, and French to Conclude Agreement on German Coal Exports

[French News Agency, Moscow, 19th] It is learned that the United Kingdom, the United States, and France will soon conclude an agreement on the issue of coal exports from the British, American, and French occupation zones in Germany, but this agreement is not within the scope of discussion of the Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference.

### Pravda Statement

We Believe Soviet Union Wants to Separate British-American Relations

[Reuters, Moscow, 20th] A "Pravda" today we believe the Soviet Union suggested that a clause should be attached to the revised British-Soviet alliance treaty to disconnect the United Kingdom from the United States. (According to reports published by the New York Times last week by our agency, and commented on by our agency's diplomatic reporter, the slowness of the progress of negotiations on revising the British-Soviet alliance treaty has made Londoners suspect that the Soviet Union's purpose in raising the treaty issue may not be to jointly defend against German aggression, but to restrict the United Kingdom's contact with other countries.) "Pravda" denounced this speculation as laughable and unintentional. The report said: According to reliable sources, the Soviet Union's proposal does not contain such clauses. The Soviet Union has never opposed the United Kingdom establishing friendly relations with the United States or France, so there is no need to attach such a clause. If British-American or British-French cooperation is not aimed at the Soviet Union, then the Soviet Union is very much in favor of it. The Soviet people firmly believe that friendly treaties between major powers should prohibit one of the contracting states from participating in groups that are detrimental to the other contracting state, regardless of what kind of disguise this participation is placed under.

### Ambassador Gu Weijun Delivers Speech in United States, Discussing United Nations Organization; Deep Concern over Unresolved Disputes in German Peace Treaty

[Associated Press, Philadelphia, 19th] Chinese Representative to the United Nations Organization, Ambassador Gu Weijun, delivered a speech at the American Academy of Political and Social Science today, stating that there are no ideological groups in the United Nations Organization, but suspicion is inevitable. In fact, the only group in the United Nations Organization is those who are suspicious, and they always vote consistently on any issue. However, peace is a concern of every country, so the future of the United Nations Organization is full of hope. I do not believe that any country that has gone through the recent war does not want peace. World stability, the establishment of an international peacekeeping force, and the issues of disarmament and atomic control all depend on the successful negotiation of peace treaties with Germany and Japan. However, since the German peace treaty has been debated and unresolved, and the Japanese peace treaty is still awaiting consultation, thoughts of unease and misunderstanding will therefore permeate the world. Confidence in the future, although not completely shaken, has also been limited. This sense of alarm, especially in the countries leading the United Nations Organization, although it will not hinder the main work of the United Nations, will slow down its progress.

### Iraq Seeks to Restore the Saadabad Pact

[French News Agency, London, 19th] Since the British government announced that it would gradually withdraw British troops from Iraq, Iraqi Prime Minister Jabr has been negotiating with Turkey, Iran, and Afghanistan to discuss the restoration of the 1937 Saadabad Pact. Political figures believe that Iraq's move can be regarded as an indication that Iraq intends to rely on the United States in the event of difficulties. However, this plan seems to be dissatisfied with the Soviet Union.

### US Diplomacy Turns Active, Determined to Suppress Communism

[Reuters, London, 20th] The Washington correspondent of the Sunday Times said: We have ample reason to believe that the State Department, that is, the entire Truman administration, is engaged in a large-scale diplomatic operation to deal with communism throughout the world. Disappointment with the Moscow Conference, and the imminent passage of the aid to Greece and Turkey bill by the Senate, will lead to a more vigorous US foreign policy, supplemented by loans on an unprecedented scale, to provide other countries with manufactured goods and food. The aid to Greece and Turkey plan may be passed by the Senate on Tuesday. According to the current plan, a larger loan to South Korea will immediately follow, and then there will be other loans. When requesting Congress to pass these aid plans, the US government will strongly state that the world needs massive US aid to suppress communism. The State Department is well aware that US producers also urgently need foreign markets. Acting Secretary of State Acheson fully supports the anti-communist policy, and the debate on the aid to Greece bill has fully clarified the sincerity of US foreign policy. The Soviet Union also knows that the United States is indeed determined to oppose communism, or at least to defend against it. If the Senate passes the aid to Greece and Turkey bill on Tuesday, it will be only forty-one days since President Truman proposed it. The House of Representatives may also pass the bill soon. According to Congressional convention, the procedure has to be said to be rapid. In addition, President Truman has also proposed abolishing the Neutrality Act, all of which can indicate a shift in US diplomacy towards an active one.

### Regarding the U.S. Aid to Greece and Turkey Plan, Guo Taiqi Expresses His Views, Believing That This U.S. Action Does Not Damage the Prestige of the United Nations

[Central News Agency, New York, 18th] The main points of the statement made by my representative, Guo Taiqi, in the United Nations Security Council are as follows: In my capacity as the representative of China, I would like to say a few words about the plan proposed by the United States representative to aid Greece and Turkey, and to clarify to the Council the position of my delegation on the two proposals. It is generally believed that the aid plan under discussion is being carried out solely by the United States without going through the United Nations, which will damage the prestige of the United Nations. I would like to point out here that the masses of this great democratic country and the American newspapers were the first to criticize their government's policies in this way. I must say that the soundness of the American political system and the effective functioning of American democracy have left a deep impression on me. The Security Council would certainly have been pleased to receive notification from the U.S. representative at the time of President Truman's proposal to aid Greece on March 12, or before. In my capacity as the representative of China, I believe that the U.S. representative submitted to the Security Council a comprehensive report on the aid plan on March 28, before the Aid to Greece and Turkey Act became law. The U.S. government considers this plan to be aid to Greece and Turkey, and this move is of great significance. The Chinese delegation welcomes this statement, which itself clearly indicates that the United States does not intend to take action without going through the United Nations. I believe that the United States is the first member state to make such a statement in the Security Council for any international loan or international plan that the Security Council or the United Nations as a whole has not been notified of, to the best of my knowledge.

### U.S.-Danish Friendship Treaty Under Continued Negotiation

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 20th] Regarding the rumor that the U.S. government has refused Denmark's request to abolish the 1941 U.S.-Danish agreement on the Greenland base, a spokesman for the Danish Embassy here recently denied it, saying that friendly negotiations are still underway, and it is hoped that the United States will begin to completely withdraw from the Greenland bases starting in 1948. According to the agreement, the United States has the right to station troops in Greenland.

### Moscow to Build Eight Skyscrapers

[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 19th] The steel frames needed for the skyscrapers to be built here are being manufactured in the Molotov Factory in Dnepropetrovsk. According to Moscow's development plan, one 22-story skyscraper, two 26-story skyscrapers, and five 16-story skyscrapers will be built.

### Wallace Arrives in Norway

[United Press, Capital of Norway, 19th] Former U.S. Vice President Wallace originally planned to give one speech here, but it has now been expanded to four lecture hall speeches and one radio speech. Mr. Wallace was very popular here today, and was called "one of the most important voices of the common people." This statement was made by Mayor Brock of Nevik during the war. Mr. Brock and Norwegian Minister of Education Fostervoll jointly hosted a banquet to welcome Mr. Wallace. Representatives from the six major national parties all attended, including two cabinet members. Mr. Foss said that Mr. Wallace's ability to bring together representatives from the conservative Christian Democratic Party, the Labor Party, the Farmers' Party, and the Communist Party in one place is his only achievement. In his speech, Mr. Wallace strongly stated that any American law that prevents Americans from publicly criticizing their own government in foreign countries should be amended to comply with the charter of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization. Mr. Wallace mentioned that some people in the United States had proposed revoking Mr. Wallace's passport and using the Logan Act to sanction him. Mr. Wallace said, "Any citizen in the world who speaks the truth is merely declaring the provisions of the charter of the cultural and educational institution. I believe that any American law that conflicts with this charter will often be amended." During the banquet, a telegram from the American Farm Bureau was read, urging Wallace to continue his struggle and guaranteeing that the vast majority of Americans are echoing Wallace's sentiments. At the same time, French left-wing politician and former Minister of Air Force, Gutier, sent a telegram from Paris to welcome Wallace to France as an "old friend" and not as an agent of any political party.

### Dutch Prime Minister Inspects Indonesia

[Reuters, The Hague, 19th] Dutch Prime Minister Beel and Colonial Minister Jonkman are expected to depart for Batavia on the 29th of this month for an inspection, staying in Indonesia for one week.

### U.S. Far East Policy

[United Press, Washington, 20th] Regardless of whether Molotov accepts Marshall's proposal to resume negotiations on the unification of Korea, the United States is determined to implement its plan to provide five to six hundred million U.S. dollars in aid to Korea. If the unification of Korea can be achieved, the aid will be directed to the entire Korea, not limited to the south of Korea. Although the U.S. plan contains elements of psychological warfare to revive the south, if Korea can be unified, then this psychological weapon will not be necessary, and the plan to aid Korea will still be implemented. This is because Korea, whether unified or divided, is in dire need of this aid. Marshall's proposal to the Soviet Union to resolve the Korean issue is very timely. If Molotov can express agreement, then the United States can obtain what it hopes to obtain, namely the unification of Korea. If the Soviet Union's response does not indicate hope for a resolution in the near future, then Marshall will ask Congress to allocate funds for economic warfare to prevent the expansion of communism in the Far East. The U.S. policy towards the Republic of Indonesia has also become increasingly important in the past week. Some State Department officials have proposed "limited recognition" of the Republic of Indonesia. If this happens, it can give a rough idea of U.S. policy in Southeast Asia. Towards the increasingly independent Burma, the United States insists on its consistent policy of sympathizing with anti-fascist leaders. The U.S. upgrading of its embassy in Bangkok to an embassy also indicates the increasing importance the U.S. attaches to Thailand. When President Truman received the Thai ambassador this week, he said that he hoped that there would be a peaceful government in the area to ensure the safety and prosperity of the people. The State Department's preparations for the Japanese peace treaty have also reached a decisive stage. Experts are still discussing specialized economic and political issues in detail, but it is believed that it will soon be formally submitted to other allied countries. According to official estimates, the Japanese peace conference may be convened this autumn, possibly in October.

### U.S. Senate Firmly Opposes Continued Shipment of Lend-Lease Materials to the Soviet Union, Accusing the Government of Policy Contradictions

[Central News Agency, Washington, 19th, United Press] The U.S. Senate has rejected the State Department's desire to provide the Soviet Union with more lend-lease materials. Chairman Bridges of the Appropriations Committee firmly opposed the State Department's move, saying that Congressional passage would have to be submitted through the Senate Appropriations Committee, and this development is unlikely. Senate President Vandenberg said that before the $11.297 billion in wartime lend-lease materials to the Soviet Union is resolved, no more lend-lease materials should be shipped to the Soviet Union. The Senate at the time accused the government of simultaneously aiding Greece and Turkey to prevent communism while also supplying materials to the Soviet Union to assist communism. The Senate is scheduled to vote on the aid to Greece and Turkey bill on the 22nd.

### British Princess Elizabeth's Birthday

[Agence France-Presse, London, 20th] The 21st is Princess Elizabeth's 21st birthday. St. Paul's Cathedral will ring bells to celebrate.

[United Press, London, 19th] British Princess Elizabeth turns 21 on Monday. From Piccadilly's nightclubs to the various districts of Wales, England is abuzz, with the Princess's birthday as the topic of conversation. In particular, people are eager to know what her 22nd year will be like. Will she marry? Will she get a new title? Will she live in a palace? We can get "yes" and "no" answers from countless self-proclaimed know-it-alls, all of whom are very certain, only the Cabinet and Buckingham Palace don't talk about it. The princess is eligible to marry at 21 years old. It is rumored that her engagement to Lieutenant Mountbatten of the former Greek group will be announced after she comes of age, but the royals in South Africa say that this is not the case. People close to Buckingham Palace also believe that the rumor that King George will grant Princess Elizabeth a new title is not credible.

### General Election Begins in Japan Yesterday, The Upper House is Directly Elected by the People for the First Time

[Asia East News Agency, Tokyo, 20th] Elections for the Japanese House of Councillors were held simultaneously across the country today. There are approximately 40 million voters. After the voting deadline, the ballots will be counted immediately, but due to the counting procedures, it will not be possible to complete all of them on the same day.

[United Press, Tokyo, 20th] Japan's national general election began at 7:00 a.m. on the 20th. More than 38.35 million voters are facing their "important responsibility" of electing 250 new members of the House of Councillors to replace the original 355 members of the House of Peers. This means that the upper house of the Japanese Diet will be directly elected by the people for the first time. Police authorities told this agency that voting this morning was "very peaceful" and there was no damage. Candidates are not allowed to speak to voters near polling stations to avoid "affecting their freedom of choice." Today is Sunday, so there are not many people voting in the morning, but according to the Tokyo city authorities, the weather is beautiful and the results will be considerable by the time voting closes at 6:00 p.m. According to Kyodo News Agency, "conservative-leaning" candidates can win 171 of the 250 seats. Government authorities said that the imperial family will not participate in the election today because, according to the Imperial Household Law, they must maintain "political neutrality." This law will remain in effect until the new constitution is implemented on May 3.

In 1938, 3.5 million tons of goods were transported via the Danube River, of which Austrian shipping companies accounted for at least 20%.

### Measures for Confiscating and Seizing the Lease Rights of Traitors' Residences: If Family Members Reside Beyond What is Needed, They May Be Ordered to Vacate Part or All of the Residence

Regarding the lease rights of traitors, the Enemy and Puppet Property Clearing Office has recently formulated the following measures for implementation of confiscation and seizure: (1) After a judgment of confiscation of property is finalized, the lease rights of traitors shall be uniformly enforced in accordance with the law. However, due to the relationship of reserving living expenses for family members, the method of use should be determined after first considering the living conditions of the family members. (2) Before the judgment is finalized, the seizure of the lease rights of traitors, in addition to seizure according to law, shall be dealt with in accordance with the following methods: (a) If the rented house is not used and is in the care of someone, it shall be taken over; (b) If the traitor's family members live in a house that clearly exceeds the degree of need, or is a larger house, and it is deemed inappropriate for the family to live in, they may be ordered to vacate part or all of the house. However, if the house is only enough for the family to live in, the family may be allowed to temporarily keep and live in it; (c) If a third party lives in the house, their legal right to reside should be reviewed. If they are occupying the house without right, they should be ordered to move out; (d) If the lease rights of traitors expire after the victory, in accordance with customary practice or contract stipulations, the lessee has the priority to continue the lease. The lessor shall not establish a new lease contract with a third party for the house used by the original lessee. (3) When implementing the above measures, the assistance of judicial organs such as military camps may be requested in accordance with the law. The above measures have been approved by the Clearing and Pseudo-Property Review Committee and reported to the Executive Yuan for record before they can be implemented.

### The Mystery of the Buyer of Yu Qiaqing's Estate: A 12-Mu Property on Chengdu Road, Disputes Between Brothers After the Sale

[Reported by this newspaper] It has been two years since Yu Qiaqing, a former business magnate in Shanghai, passed away in Chongqing in the spring of the 34th year of the Republic of China. Yu's huge estate in Shanghai during his lifetime is now being sorted out by the "Estate Sorting Committee." Recently, a thought-provoking property rights dispute suddenly occurred. Both parties commissioned lawyers to publish advertisements in the newspaper, attacking each other. The reporter inquired about the details from both parties and compiled them as follows:

Yu Qiao has three sons: the eldest is named Shun'en, the second is named Shunmao, and the third is named Shunwei. During the later period of the Anti-Japanese War, after Yu went to the mainland, his property and business in Shanghai were managed by Shun'en. Unfortunately, Mr. Qiao died in Chongqing in the spring of the year before the Japanese surrender. After the victory, the heirs of Mr. Qiao's estate organized an "Estate Sorting Committee" to handle all the estate. A month ago, the eldest brother, Shun'en, reported to the "Sorting Committee" that two properties on Jing'an Temple Road and Chengdu Road, totaling twelve mu and six li and six hao, and all buildings had been sold to a real estate merchant named Yu Shunyuan in early February of this year, for a total price of 158 taels of gold (each tael weighing ten taels), of which 20 taels were deducted for interest (due to previous loans) and 7 taels for commission. Shunmao and Shunwei believed that the property was jointly owned and that the eldest brother could not dispose of it alone. Moreover, since the property was worth more than 1,000 taels of gold at the time, Shun'en sold it at a cheap price of one-tenth, and the buyer was named "Yu Shunyuan," which made them suspicious, thinking that "Shunyuan" might be an alias for Shun'en, and that the buying and selling behavior was also a mystery made up by Shun'en. They commissioned three lawyers, Jiang Pingfan, Duanmu Kai, and Li Chaonian, to publish a statement in the newspaper, stating that the property rights of the property were jointly owned by the three of them, and could not be transferred or burdened without the consent of all the co-owners. The next day, attorney Hong Shihao, representing Yu Shunyuan, refuted and declared the property rights in an advertisement. According to Attorney Hong's statement to the reporter: Yu Shunyuan is from Wujin and has been in the real estate business for decades. He definitely exists and is not an alias deliberately created by others. The seller of the property is Yu Shun'en, and the names of Xu Shunmao and Yu Shunwei are not listed on the property certificate or registration procedures, nor is there any record of co-ownership. Moreover, Yu Shun'en stated in writing: "It is definitely self-produced and self-sold, and there are no entanglements of any rights of the family or third parties." He also said: As for Yu Shunmao and Yu Shunwei's suspicion that Yu Shunyuan is an alias for Yu Shun'en, it is a foolish guess. If Xu Shun'en used an alias to replace him, why not create another surname and insist on using the word "Yu Shun" to cause suspicion? How could there be such an unwise person? Yu Shunyuan is a completely unrelated second person, only his name is coincidental. Although only Shunmao and Shunwei have come forward to interfere, how could they know so much about the buying and selling process? It is impossible not to suspect that they are in cahoots, and the three brothers are trying to overturn the completed sale, etc. However, according to Yu Shunmao and Shunwei, "Yu Shunyuan" definitely does not exist. The so-called Wujin origin refers to a certain Yu in the Zhejiang Xingye Bank. Yu is also an important person in the case because he was the original handler of the buying and selling of this property. The contact information of a true Shunyuan" can also be transferred through him. He once told people that this property was entrusted to him by a French priest to purchase it under an alias, etc.

Whether this case is a genuine property rights dispute or a variant of an inheritance dispute, the reporter has no way of knowing. However, Yu Shun'en swore an oath to the two brothers Shunmao and Shunwei, stating that this sale did occur. Shunwei and Shunmao resolutely stated that they could not give up ownership of the property. Jiang Yiping is now mediating between the two as the elder brother-in-law, so there is no litigation for the time being.

### Elementary School Teacher Reduced to Laborer; Meager Income Leads to Suicide by Jumping; Yu Jingshan Leaves Behind Two Elegantly Written Suicide Notes

[Our Report] Yesterday morning at 9:00 AM, a young man of approximately 30 years of age jumped from the fourth floor of the Anli Building on Sichuan Middle Road and committed suicide. He was rushed to Renji Hospital for treatment, but succumbed to his injuries and died. After an investigation by the police, it was learned that the deceased was named Yu Jingshan, from Ningbo. He had been an elementary school teacher in this city. After losing his job, he was introduced by a friend to work as a laborer at the Huaxing Clothing Company at 250 Fujian Road. Recently, due to rising prices and a meager monthly income, he found it difficult to support his family and thus committed suicide in despair. Before his death, he left behind two suicide notes, one addressed to his elderly mother in his hometown and the other to his wife, Ju Qing. The writing in both notes was quite elegant.

### Pan Gongzhan Speaks on News and Advertising; This Newspaper Held Its Third Weekly Broadcast Yesterday

[Our Report] This newspaper held its third special Sunday broadcast at the Yameilin Radio Station yesterday. Mr. Wu Zhihui, a veteran of the Party and the nation, was originally invited to give a speech, but was unable to attend due to other engagements. Mr. Pan Gongzhan, the president of this newspaper, delivered a speech on "News and Advertising." The full text of his speech is as follows:

"The general public divides the content of newspapers into two parts: news and advertising. Advertising revenue can sustain the news business, and the power of news can attract advertising. The two are mutually beneficial. However, if we look deeper, ordinary people think that advertising is merely a tool for businesses to attract customers. From the newspaper's perspective, advertising is also news. For example, a major company's clearance sale advertisement, which lists the types of goods, the low prices, and provides customers with references and choices, is news. As another example, someone who has lost stocks or contracts publishes a notice in the newspaper declaring them void. On the surface, it is purely advertising, but in reality, it is also news, because by seeing this advertisement, you will not buy something that is no longer valid and suffer unnecessary losses. This kind of advertisement already has the function of news. Because advertising has a significant impact, we should pay as much attention to the content, potential effects, and value of advertising as we do to news.

Accepting Advertising Requires Prior Review

After receiving an advertisement, the newspaper must first review whether its content is factual, accurate, and whether it deceives readers or gives readers a negative impression. It is not that any advertisement will be published as long as there is an advertising fee. Publishing an advertisement that deceives readers has the same impact on readers as publishing an inaccurate news item. The newspaper is equally responsible. This is the spirit that Shen Bao upholds. With a history of over seventy years, it has always been very cautious about publishing advertisements. Advertisements that deceive readers will not be published, even if the advertising fee is ten times higher. Our view of the value of advertising is not based on its size, location, or order of publication. We base it on its impact on culture and education. Due to strict restrictions, revenue will naturally suffer initially, but over time, as trust is established in society, companies, shops, and factories will be happy to publish advertisements that are valued by the public, and the results will inevitably yield the rewards they deserve.

Many News Items Also Have Advertising Value

Conversely, news also has advertising value. Because it is not easy to publish a news item, newspaper space is limited. Taking this newspaper as an example, with two and a half pages of newspapers each day, after removing advertising, the remaining space must be used to publish domestic and foreign news. It is truly complex and countless. Therefore, every news item is carefully selected and not published casually. Once published, if 100,000 copies of the newspaper are sold, and on average ten people read one copy of the newspaper, then one million people will see it. If 200,000 copies of the newspaper are sold, then two million people will see it. This is equivalent to doing free advertising for something, which is the advertising effect of news. For example, government announcements or laws are advertisements, but they can also be published in the form of news. It is very difficult for general companies, shops, and factories to publish a news item on a newspaper with limited space, but if there is such an unknown small shop whose goods are indeed cheap and of good quality, or an unknown small factory whose products are indeed genuine, our newspaper is happy to promote them.

Thinking of Readers, Serving Society

It is not to promote a shop or a factory, but to serve society and think of readers. Even if a company, shop, or factory has not commissioned an advertisement, we must take on the responsibility of reporting. This newspaper wholeheartedly serves readers, first combining news and advertising into one, and then using the power of broadcasting to combine readers, listeners, and companies, shops, and factories into one, hoping that both the production and consumption aspects of society can benefit from Shen Bao's services. This is our contribution to society."

### Famous Performers Gather; Excellent Program, Hard to Match

Yesterday was this newspaper's third special Sunday broadcast. The Peking opera program was exceptionally wonderful. In addition to the complete "Sangyuan Hui" by famous performer Fan Shiren and his wife, Miss Zhu Shengqing's "Entrusting Dreams at the Monument," and Mr. Shen Bainian's "Life and Death Hate," famous performer Zhao Tongshan also sang "Chunxiang Enlightening Learning" (accompanied by the flute king Xu Baiqiu), Miss Wu Husheng of the Ju Society performed "Cosmic Seal," Miss Fu Ronghua performed "Ten Judgements" (Yan School), Mr. Gu Wenshao performed "The Drunken Concubine," and Mr. He Shixi and Mr. Zhang Zhesheng performed "Battle of the Heroes to Capture the Gais." This time, famous drummer Wei Xiyun also helped with the drumming, and the famous musicians Fu Baojing and Dang Yunliang brothers played the strings, which was especially rare and wonderful. After the Peking opera, there was Kunqu opera, Zhang Yuanhe and Yi Er Xiaojie's "Hongli Ji Ting Hui," Zhao Jingshen and his wife Li Xitong's "Pipa Ji Pan Fu," Miss Fang Yingda's "Hongli Ji A Visit," Shen Bainian's "Assassinating Hu," Miss Yin Junong's "Handan Dream Sweeping Flowers Three Drunks," Wu Jichuan's "Qin Tiao," Zhao Jingshen's "Qiao Vinegar," Wang Yi Er Xiaojie's "Lou Hui," Yin Junong Xiaojie and Gu Taitai's duet "Chang Sheng Dian Xiaoyan," which did not end until 12:00.

### Neighboring Metropolis, Tiny Shanghai County; Handover between New and Old County Magistrates; Only 300,000 Yuan Left in Cash; Poverty Hinders Local Development

[Special Report by This Newspaper] Shanghai County and Shanghai City, although only one character apart in name, are worlds apart in form and substance. Although Shanghai County is closely adjacent to Shanghai City, in every aspect, it is like a general township in the interior, still stagnating in a backward stage.

Shanghai County is the smallest county in Jiangsu Province. Although its current total area is more than 250,000 mu, in terms of the county's population and income, it is not as good as the smallest "district" in Shanghai City. This makes people realize that a district chief in Shanghai City is, in fact, equivalent to a state governor.

The Shanghai County Government is located in Minhang Town, sixty li outside the South City. Yesterday, the reporter drove to visit. Along the way, rapeseed flowers were everywhere, and green willows swayed. Leaving the hustle and bustle of the city, I immediately felt refreshed. The urban area of Minhang Town is very small, the two main streets are narrow and cramped, the market is bleak, and the whole scene is desolate. After eight years of the War of Resistance, the general sideline business of the people of Shanghai County is to manufacture matchboxes for Shanghai match merchants with the most original labor. The price of one thousand matchboxes is 3,000 yuan, and the middlemen enjoy one-half without deduction. The hard workers actually get only 1,500 yuan, and they have to provide the paste themselves. "Sir, it is not easy to make one thousand matchboxes a day from morning to night!" they said. However, there is a surplus of labor in the countryside, and everyone is scrambling for this cheap business.

The prices in the county town follow Shanghai City, as easily as directing one's arm. These days, white rice in Minhang is also fluctuating around 180,000 yuan. You can't find anything cheaper than Shanghai here, only the eggs unique to the general countryside, which only sell for 300 yuan each. Whole batches of native cloth, because there is no large market, the cloth merchants are sitting there dozing.

At noon, the reporter visited the County Middle School and the Shanxin National School. Xue Huikang, the principal of the County Middle School, is a respected veteran educator in the area. When he saw the reporter, he was as friendly as meeting a kindred spirit, and pulled me to visit the dilapidated classrooms and the students' dormitories and dining halls that he struggled to maintain. Teachers and students alike stood there eating vegetarian meals. The teachers' monthly salary of only 300,000 yuan is already two months in arrears. It is said that all kinds of salaries in the county are like this. The former county magistrate Ni Youxiang left, leaving a finance section chief to handle the handover. The new county magistrate took office and received only 300,000 yuan in cash. Everyone knows that there is little revenue for county government expenses now, so they can't ask the new county magistrate for debts, and they have to wait patiently.

The new county magistrate, Yu Yueqiu, used to be a professor at Tongji University. He arrived in the county on the 2nd of this month. He is facing the debts left by the former county magistrate. He is planning with local people how to balance future revenue and expenditure. According to County Magistrate Yu, the county's annual land tax revenue is more than 900 million yuan, and various taxes are about 20 million yuan per month. 50% is paid to the central and provincial governments, and 50% (about 400 million yuan) is retained for local use. The county's security team has more than 130 people, each with a salary of less than 10,000 yuan. There are more than 80 police officers, with a monthly salary of 20,000 yuan. In order to maintain local security, it is planned to train volunteer police and strengthen the organization of self-defense teams. Recently, a small number of bandits were discovered looting between Sanlintang and Chenxing in the county, and they are being suppressed. Among the 120,000 people in the county, there are more than 200 smokers. A general inspection is scheduled for June 1 this year to reorganize the baojia system and check household registrations. In other aspects of land administration, society, education, construction, and health, County Magistrate Yu gave detailed explanations of his plans in turn. In the end, in one sentence, the income is too little, and it is inevitable that the actual implementation will be discounted.

It was learned from other local people that they wanted to increase the surtax by 2 jiao per mu in addition to the land tax to help the county government's operations. This proposal will be submitted to the County Council for discussion.

The problem of Shanghai County is the same as the situation in various parts of China today: "poverty." The poverty of financial and material resources hinders the development of local undertakings.

### Conflict Over Buying Fresh Meat in Bulk; Shop Assistant Wields Axe to Chop Competitor

[Our Report] At the Huashan Road small vegetable market, yesterday morning, when the market was at its peak, Li Dechang, who set up a fresh meat stall, having sold out all his pork, bought more than 30 jin of fresh meat in bulk from the meat stall set up by Yin Fusheng next door. During weighing, a dispute arose due to insufficient weight, leading to a conflict. At that time, a shop assistant named Gu Guoqing actually chopped at Li's head with a meat-chopping axe. Li quickly dodged and was not hit, but Peng Zhenglin, a competitor standing beside him, was caught off guard and was hit in the left shoulder by the axe. He immediately fell to the ground injured, bleeding profusely. People then called the police on duty to the scene, and the assailant was arrested and taken to the bureau for interrogation. The injured person was taken to Baoji Hospital for treatment by car.

### Once an Enemy Secret Agent; Framed Father and Son Villagers; Li Xiaosi Arrested While Strolling in Garden

[Our Report] Hu Zixiao, 34, from Baoshan, is in the printing business and currently works at No. 55, Lane 779, Chengdu North Road. Hu's uncle, Guiyan, lives in Baojia Building, Yangxi Township, Baoshan, farming for a living and has a small fortune. On a certain day in May of the 29th year of the Republic, Li Xiaosi (41 years old), a fellow villager who had served as an enemy secret agent, framed Guiyan and his son Zigan, accusing them of being Chongqing elements and guides for the Japanese military police, and arrested the father and son. By 6:00 AM the next morning, the bodies of Hu's father and son were found, killed on the wasteland at the corner of Baojia Building. At that time, the family was helpless because they were afraid of his power. After the victory, Hu Zixiao filed a complaint with the Baoshan County Government, but Li escaped to other places and was never apprehended. At 11:30 AM yesterday morning, Li was wandering around the Outer Garden with his mistress Xie Jinmei when Hu Zixiao spotted him. He called the police at post No. 2767, and they were both arrested and taken to the Huangpu Police Bureau. After interrogation, the case became clear. Because the crime scene was under the jurisdiction of Baoshan County, he will be brought back for prosecution.

### Jiaotong University's Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering Department May Be Reorganized and Continued; Alumni Association to Meet Tonight to Discuss

[Our Newspaper] At the Jiaotong University Alumni Association meeting during the school anniversary celebration, the alumni's opinions were solicited regarding Jiaotong University's plan to reorganize the Department of Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering and continue its operation. At that time, Vice Minister Ling Hongxun represented the Ministry of Communications and expressed a written opinion: "Hongxun absolutely advocates continuing the operation: (1) Jiaotong University used to have this department, (2) This department has a related relationship with other departments of the university, (3) Naval architecture and marine engineering are both disciplines related to transportation, and it is extremely appropriate for Jiaotong University to run this department. (4) The domestic and foreign shipping industries are actively developing, and there is an urgent need for talent, so there is no reason to discontinue it. (5) The Ministry of Communications is also entrusting Jiaotong University to train a large number of naval architecture and marine engineering talents, allocating funds to purchase equipment, and setting up lectureships, which is being reported to the Executive Yuan for approval, so it should not be terminated." However, the Alumni Association's letter to Minister Zhu of the Ministry of Education has been sent for many days and has not yet been approved. Therefore, on the 18th of this month, the Alumni Association sent representatives Zhang Gongwei and Wang Jinlin to Beijing to consult with the Ministry of Communications again. Vice Minister Ling received them, and Director Li of the Navigation Administration Department explained that the Ministry of Communications had previously submitted a request to the Executive Yuan for an appropriation of 1 billion yuan to add equipment and lectureships at Jiaotong University, which has been approved by the Executive Yuan. Therefore, he expressed great sympathy for the Alumni Association's request to the Ministry of Education to approve the reorganization and continuation of the Department of Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering, and expressed absolute support. Before the conversation was over, Minister Yu also arrived and believed that Jiaotong University's Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering must continue to operate. At this point, the representatives were satisfied and left, and have now returned to Shanghai. It is heard that the Alumni Association is scheduled to hold a symposium tonight to discuss the next steps.

### Shantou Team's Performance Unexpectedly Brilliant; Hualian Wins Championship After Hard Fight; Forty to Thirty-Eight, Only Two Points Apart; This Year's Basketball League Concludes Satisfactorily Yesterday

[Our Newspaper] The final of the A Group of the Second Basketball League was held last night at the Municipal Gymnasium. Hualian defeated Shantou Team by two points to retain the championship, with a score of 40 to 38. The score at halftime was 23 to 17. The two teams went back and forth, with many changes, and the whole game was a seesaw battle. The audience of 5,000 people mostly came from the soccer field, using bread as rations, truly basketball fans.

Both sides performed well last night, which was satisfying. Hualian's Bao Songyuan scored 18 points alone, which was indispensable. Cheng Zhang's steals, Xue Chong's sprints, Guangyi's long shots, and Xiangcheng's conservativeness all had their strengths. Shantou Team's Lide and Weicong performed heroically. Last night, they were agile, Qingjiang took care of both the front and back, and Canxi blocked well. Although they lost by only two points, it was both fortunate and unfortunate.

Hualian Fights Hard; One Point Ahead

Before the game, the photographers were busy taking photos. After each team took photos, they took a group photo. Only six people were photographed into the lens of Hualian. Li Zhenzhong leaned against the wall, quietly watching and appreciating under the slogan "Please Keep Order to Appreciate Technology" in the gymnasium.

It started on time at 7:30. After a short struggle, Shantou Team's Lin Weicong scored, and He Lide broke through on the left, immediately scoring four points. Hualian's A Kong and Xue Chong tried repeatedly but failed to score. Bao Songyuan made a layup under the basket. Unexpectedly, Cai Yanxiong scored with one hand. Hualian called a timeout. As the whistle sounded, Chen Qingjiang jumped up in front of the basket and threw the ball in amidst the chaos, and the audience shouted "Strange ball!" A Di Xue Chong succeeded one after another, and Shantou Team still led with 8 to 6, but also wanted to take a timeout to dampen the opponent's spirit. Lao Bao made a free throw with one hand, and Xue Chong scored another goal. Hualian surpassed by 9 to 8 with a score of one point.

The Situation is Tense and Halftime Ends

A Kong calmly made a long shot, and Lin Weicong returned the favor. Kong revisited the old place, and Bao added a goal, with Shantou Team trailing by five points at 15 to 10. Xiangcheng, Qingjiang, and Xue Chong made no mistakes on free throws. He Lide threw in a goal with a pushing posture. A Kong made his third long shot. Lao Bao, Yanxiong, and Weicong competed for the ball. Shantou Team took another timeout. There were only three seconds left in the first half. As a result, Hualian led by six points at 23 to 17 in a tense state.

Shantou Team Launches a Fierce Attack and Surpasses by Three Points

After the break, Shantou Team replaced Weicong with Ji Nankang. He Lide made the first contribution. The opponent Lao Bao made a free throw. In an instant, Qingjiang, Lide, and A Cai scored five points with two throws and one free throw (25 to 24), and Hualian had only one more point. Bao made a free throw, and Cai scored. The situation turned into a tie at 26 points again. Hualian took another timeout. Cai made a free throw and surpassed by one point. Under the cheers of the audience for Shantou Team, He Lide lived up to expectations and led by three points. At this time, Hualian was flustered. When Ren Xiangcheng broke through and scored, A Di also scored, and it was easy to chase out with 30 to 29.

The Last Two Minutes Decide the Outcome

Xue Chong grabbed the ball at the bottom of the basket and scored. Lin made a throw and Cai made a free throw. Shantou Team was still behind by one point with 34 to 33. At that time, A Kong closely guarded Cai, but both of his free throws missed. He Lide scored at the basket and chased out by one point with 34 to 35. Qingjiang made another free throw and scored two more points. Lao Bao, Weicong, and Lao Bao tied the score at 38. Bao made a free throw and scored one more point with 39 to 38. Ren Xiangcheng graduated and was replaced by Zhuo. Qingjiang graduated and Ji entered as a substitute. Hualian took their fifth timeout in the last eight seconds. Finally, Wu Chen scored one point with a free throw, making it 40 to 38, which settled the overall situation and Hualian won the championship.

### Ever-Victorious Army Suffers UnprecedentedÊÉ®Ë¥•; Seoul Team Wins Big Over Donghua; Two Goals Scored in Each Half

The Seoul soccer team expedition team played their fourth friendly match in Shanghai against the ever-victorious Donghua team at the Yiguo Stadium yesterday. The fans were shaken by the reputation of the two teams, with an estimated 13,000 to 14,000 people. The road on Shaanxi Road was crowded with vehicles and horses. The ticket office of the Municipal Gymnasium almost created an unprecedentedÁõõÂÜµ, and there was no vacant seat in the Bing area of Yiyuan Stadium. Fortunately, the police maintained order effectively, and the order was still good. Dr. Syngman Rhee, the leader of Korea, also came to the stadium yesterday to watch the game, so the morale of the visiting team was even higher. As a result, Donghua was severely poisoned by the visiting team with a score of zero to four because LaoÈêî's long-term injury did not heal, and Jia Youliang was injured and left the field. The lineups of both sides yesterday were as follows:

Seoul

Che Chunjong Park Daejong Park Gyujeong Min Byeongdae Kim Gyuhwan Ju Yeonggwang Jeong Gukjin Kim Yongshik Jeong Namje Oh Gyeonghwan Wu Jinghwan

Donghua

Zhang Banglun Zhuang Youren Zhang Lingen Liang Shutang Han LongboÈêîFuzhen Yu Qiaxing Li Yao Sun Jinshun Han Longhai Dai Linjing Jia Youliang (Up), Chen Mingzhe (Down)

The Expeditionary Force Opens the Record First

At 4:30 PM, referee He Chunhui, and linesmen Deng Xiaoliang and Chen Jixiang, took the stage to enforce the law. The two teams took a group photo together. After the captains of Donghua and the visiting team exchanged team flags, the game began. Seoul was against the sun and attacked with the wind. Kim Yongshik and Jeong Namje had shots on goal, and Zhuang and Lingen saved the situation one after another. Donghua attacked but did not gain anything. In the melee to the eighth minute, the visiting team launched an attack. Jeong Gukjin launched a surprise attack on the cold road, swept into the net from the crowd at the fourteen-yard mark, Zhang Banglun's vision was blocked, and he lost his hand, and the visiting team took the lead with a score of one to zero. For the loss of this ball by Donghua, Zhang Lingen was negligent and should bear considerable responsibility.

Twelve-Yard Mark, Donghua is Deceived Again

Donghua counterattacked, and Youliang advanced rapidly on the border, passing the ball in the center with one foot at the appropriate point, but Longhai did not get the header, and A Dai also had a shot, but it was too wild. In the seventeenth minute, the visiting team launched a large-scale attack. Oh Gyeonghwan and Jeong Namje had repeated shots on goal, and Zhuang's business was booming. In the melee to the twenty-fifth minute, Jia Youliang was injured in his leg and left the field. After bandaging, he re-entered the field. In the thirty-sixth minute, LaoÈêî's fatigue was fully revealed, and the visiting team took advantage of the situation to enter. Jeong Namje made a cold shot, and the momentum was fierce and dangerous. Zhang Banglun pounced and captured it, and the audience applauded thunderously. One minute before the end of the first half, Zhang Lingen was eager to save the ball in the penalty area, kissed the ball with his hand, and committed a twelve-yard major crime. The visiting team was penalized by right-wing two Jinghuan, and the ball was extremely tricky. Banglun pounced in vain, two to zero, Donghua lost another city, and the first half ended.

Seoul Team Scores Three Goals in a Row

After changing sides, Seoul remained unchanged, Donghua Jia Youliang retired, and a nephew Chen Mingzhe filled the gap. After the center circle kick-off, Dai Yuanlao and Han General used both pipes, and A Dai shot hard, and Che Chunjong pounced it out. After five minutes,ÈêîFuzhen also said goodbye, Liang Shutang filled in, and Han Longbo served as the center. Donghua's lineup became even weaker. In the tenth minute, Jeong Namje went it alone and went straight into Donghua's hinterland. Zhang Banglun saw that there were few people in the back defense and rushed out to save, but it was a pity that the ball was not far away and was still at Xiang Nanje's feet. Banglun had no time to turn back and shoot, three to zero, and another city was lost

Four to Zero, UnprecedentedÊÖòË¥•

Although Donghua launched a large-scale counterattack, the visiting team's defense was strict and there was no gap to enter, and the visiting team had abundant long-term strength, and the five fronts had shooting performances from time to time. In the twenty-third minute, Longhai and Mingzhe exchanged positions, but they still did not make any progress. Three minutes later, Jeong Namje crossed Han Longbo and shot hard with his foot. Banglun pounced in vain and was lost again, resulting in a score of four to zero. In the thirtieth minute, Longhai got a corner kick opportunity, but Mingzhe's head was not effective. In the melee to five minutes before the end of the game, Seoul midfielder Zhu Rongguang was injured by Sun's iron leg due to fighting for the ball. Fortunately, there was no major problem. Before long, the statutory time was over, and Donghua was brutally poisoned by the visiting team with a score of zero to four. The Municipal Association and Sporting Goods Company, in order to encourage the morale of the visiting team, specially presented the Tianzi football, the honorary product of the company, and a pennant to the Seoul expedition team yesterday.

[United Press, Boston, 19th] The 51st Boston Marathon was held in Boston today. Korean Xu Renfu won the championship and created a new record with two hours, twenty-five minutes and thirty-nine seconds. Mr. Xu is 24 years old and a student at Qixian University. He led from the start and did not lose his strength until the end. Finnish player Haitainan won second place, and Xu and Hai ran side by side for nearly six miles, without distinguishing themselves, until they ran to "Heartbreak Hill" before they separated, because the slope of the hill was steep and difficult to climb. Most long-distance runners have been frustrated here in the past. Mr. Xu strode over the hillside, and he was like a horse off the leash, leading far away, and when he reached the finish line, he still had the courage to drum. Another Korean, Nam Seung-yong, ranked twelfth, and Sun Jizhen, the marathon champion of the last World Games, failed to make the list. The entire marathon is twenty-six miles and three hundred and eighty-five yards. The old record was two hours, twenty-six minutes, and fifty-one seconds, which was created by American Smith five years ago. Mr. Smith also participated in the competition today, but withdrew after twenty-three miles.

### Basketball Sidelines

Hualian and Shanteam fought last night for the championship of the Class 1 Group A Basketball League, and the City Stadium was once again packed. The two teams were locked in a tough battle, and with one minute left in the game, they were still tied at 38 points each. In the final moments, Bao Songyuan and Wu Chengzhang made two free throws, securing the title.

Da Li was absent from yesterday's game, and the entire Hualian team seemed to have lost its center of gravity, falling behind 2-8 at the start. In the first half, Kong Guangyi's long shot had unexpected results, quickly scoring three goals, and the Soviet Union took the lead with these valuable six points.

Strategically, both sides had exhausted all their efforts. Shanteam remained determined to cherish every opportunity to score, never wasting them, and coupled with accurate shooting skills. In defense, they tried to control the three shooters of Hualian, with Cai Yanxiong guarding Wu Chengzhang, He Lide guarding Chen Xuechong, and Ma Canxi guarding Bao Songyuan. Of these, Cai's defense of Wu was most successful in the first half.

Due to Da Li's absence, Hualian had no one to lead the way and find openings. Lao Bao, as center, also had to take care of protecting the basket, which was an unfamiliar position. Lao Kong found it very difficult to watch Lin Weizong, but Xiao Lin's shooting last night had not reached his peak condition, and Xiang Cheng was only responsible for watching Qingjiang, preventing his movements.

In the second half, Ji Nankang replaced Xiao Lin, and Shanteam scored five consecutive goals, while Hualian only made four free throws. Hualian once trailed by as many as three points. At this time, A Di and Xuechong took advantage of the narrowest of opportunities to shoot from extremely difficult angles, managing to maintain the balance.

Shanteam's performance was flawless, and one missed shot was not enough to determine victory or defeat. In fact, given Hualian's current situation, they would never have faced such a great threat from anyone other than Shanteam. (Changnian)

### Rural Construction and Universal National Education

‚Äî Hu Shuyi

Although there are thousands of things to be done in China's construction, the fundamental work should still start with rural construction. Our discussion of rural construction problems still focuses on education, or in other words, using the power of education to enlighten farmers' knowledge, increase farmers' production, strengthen farmers' physique, and cultivate farmers' habits of cooperation and unity. Since ancient times, China has taken "teaching and nurturing together" as the guideline for local administration. Now, in building the countryside, we must use the power of education, which is the same principle. Let's cite a few obvious facts to prove that national construction must first build the countryside, and that building the countryside must first universalize national education.

First, for thousands of years, China has been an agricultural country. The food and clothing needed by the people of the whole country, the raw materials for light industry, and the materials needed for inter-port international trade come directly and indirectly from the countryside. Therefore, the lifeline of the people of the whole country lies in the vast and scattered countryside.

Second, more than 90 percent of the country's land belongs to the countryside. Looking at the population, lifestyle, and production technology, at least nine-tenths of the country's counties and cities still belong to rural society, and at least three or four rural areas exist within each county. There are nearly one million rural societies of varying sizes throughout the country, so the countryside is the foundation for organizing the country.

Third, the national population is estimated to be 450 million, at least four-fifths of whom live in the countryside. Most of the residents in these rural areas are illiterate farmers. To build our nation, we must eliminate the illiteracy of four-fifths of the national population.

From the above three points, we can already reach the conclusion that building the country must first build the countryside, and building the countryside should first popularize national education. Moreover, Sun Yat-sen, the founding father, specifically pointed out the importance of establishing schools in the Law on the Implementation of Local Autonomy, which also shows us the possibility and necessity of building the countryside through education. We should follow this instruction and further study the methods of implementation.

Using the method of universal national education to build the countryside, apart from the two practical problems of teachers and economy, which will not be discussed in detail in this article, two innovative beliefs are really needed in terms of educational theory‚Äîor it can even be said that they are two firm guidelines: First, education should be coordinated with production; Second, education should be integrated with life. The former is the driving force for teaching and supporting the people. Teaching and nurturing farmers with production as the center, they will feel the need for education. The latter is the starting point for governing and protecting the people, using education to enable farmers to manage and defend themselves. Such rural national education takes the actual life of farmers as the object of educational facilities and agricultural production as the goal of educational facilities. If the farmers' lifestyle is improved and agricultural production is prosperous, the purpose of building the countryside through the educational process can also be achieved. Isn't the power of education the driving force for building the countryside? The following is a further explanation of the sub-items:

(1) Rural National Education and Rural Production Cooperation: The basic occupation in China's rural areas is still agriculture, so the most important goal of rural national education facilities should be to increase agricultural production. Some people in our country advocate rural national education, some focus on literacy education, and some focus on civic education, but regardless of literacy education or civic education, agricultural production should always be the center of national education facilities. For example, animal husbandry, afforestation, water conservancy, horticulture, breeding, and rural small-scale industries are all coordinated with literacy education or fully applied to civic education. Such implementation of rural national education is the work that farmers need to do every day, and its function is like proper sunlight and rain. All kinds of crops, after being nurtured by sunlight and rain, will flourish and grow. Ask any farmer who doesn't like sunlight and rain! For the same reason, if agricultural production can be gradually increased through the national education of rural areas, ask any farmer who does not need the popularity of national education! Therefore, the reason why rural national education is not developed is not so much because of insufficient funding as it is because education is not coordinated with production.

(2) Rural National Education and Rural Life Integration: Undoubtedly, the promotion of rural national education should follow the regulations and establish schools in townships and villages, but we must know that schools are only limited places for teaching. To implement the true spirit of national education, we must also pay attention to the infinite new field of national education, which is the entire rural society. The former's power, in the national education process, is of course the base for propaganda and demonstration, and the latter is the focus of rural national education. Engaging in rural national education should adhere to the base and promote its central work. If rural national education is not carried out with the entire rural society as its teaching field and the entire people as its teaching object, two opposite phenomena will result: First, schools are easily made into consumer institutions; Second, education will not meet the needs of farmers. These two phenomena weaken the function of national education, and as a result, the mission of national schools to build the countryside will never be realized!

In short, when schools and society are integrated, education and life naturally melt together! When education and production are coordinated, schools and construction naturally become one! This theory is originally the true meaning of national education and is naturally most applicable to the current rural construction in our country. We know that the countryside is the most extensive grassroots level in China. To establish the country from the grassroots level is to build the foundation of the country. Therefore, using the popularization of national education to build the countryside, on the one hand, solves the education problem of the vast population of the whole country, and on the other hand, embarks on the road to building a new China.

### To Curb Rising Cotton Yarn Prices, Authorities Decide to Adopt Emergency Measures; Private Yarn Factories Eagerly Await the Implementation of New Control Plan

[Our Report] It is reported that the central authorities believe that the recent price fluctuations in the Shanghai market, especially the soaring price of cotton yarn, seem to have entered a rampant state, which is not appropriate. Therefore, they are about to take emergency measures, formulate several prohibitions, and hand them over to the Shanghai Municipal Government and relevant agencies for implementation in order to curb the unreasonable rise in cotton yarn prices and stabilize people's livelihoods.

Private Textile Business Cannot Be Maintained

In recent days, the price of yarn in the Shanghai market has continued to rise sharply, and the difference between the market price and the negotiated price has become increasingly apparent. The result of state-owned yarn factories selling yarn is only to allow middlemen to sit back and reap the profits. It is no longer possible for private yarn factories to continue to sell yarn at negotiated prices, so yarn sales have fallen into a state of stagnation. Yarn merchants, on the other hand, feel that they cannot maintain their business because they rely only on the small amount of yarn allocated by the Textile Construction Company. The yarn market, due to the excessive difference between the market price and the negotiated price, has made it impossible for legitimate transactions to continue and has also come to a standstill. The production and sale of cotton yarn have both fallen into a state of paralysis. Therefore, the relevant authorities believe that the decisive implementation of emergency measures is imperative.

Control Measures Take All Aspects into Account

In terms of fundamental solutions, the comprehensive production and sales plan proposed by private yarn factories is also under active consideration. In the past, the policy of controlling cotton yarn often failed due to one-sided control. For example, neglecting flowers while taking care of yarn, the result of soaring flower prices was that the original agreed yarn price became out of sync, unable to make flexible adjustments, resulting in stagnation of reproduction. The new control measures in the plan will comprehensively manage everything from flowers to yarn, as well as the planning and adjustment of funds. From the initial stage of obtaining raw materials to the final stage of selling finished products, each stage will be linked together to ensure mutual coordination and response. It is reported that state-owned and private yarn factories have reached a consensus on the pace of this new control plan. Once the specific plan is finalized, it will be submitted to the relevant authorities for adoption and implementation.

Enrich the Textile Management Committee

In addition, the Textile Management Committee, the agency that controls cotton yarn, is also brewing enrichment. The original number of 11 committee members is about to be expanded, with rumors of adding four committee members from private yarn factories. A textile industry tycoon told reporters: The enrichment of the Textile Management Committee is also a major test of the success or failure of democracy. If the new control plan proposed by private yarn factories can be implemented, the enforcement of the law must be strict, and after implementation, everyone should strictly abide by the law. Then, the production and sales problems of cotton yarn can be easily solved in a reasonable way.

Yarn Numbers Must Have Licenses to Receive Yarn

The China Textile Corporation has very strict restrictions on yarn allocation. In addition to stipulating various measures, cotton yarn stores, cotton weaving factories, and yarn factories must have business registration licenses from the Social Affairs Bureau and the Industry and Commerce Bureau. Therefore, in the past week, factories and stores that have not registered with the Industry and Commerce Bureau have been applying to the Social Affairs Bureau for business registration in order to obtain yarn allocation from the China Textile Corporation. It is reported that a large number of applicants have gone to the Bureau, and the Industry and Commerce Section of the Social Affairs Bureau is now stepping up its review work to simplify the process and issue licenses as soon as possible to facilitate the development of industry and commerce.

### Silk Cooperative Factory Can Start Work After Receiving Electricity

The needle and thread cooperative factory and the clothing cooperative factory established with the guidance of the Social Affairs Bureau are currently developing smoothly. The Bureau, considering its financial constraints, applied to the Central Treasury for a loan of 60 million yuan on behalf of the factory, promising to guarantee it, which has been approved by the Treasury. However, the clothing cooperative factory was founded by unemployed workers from the Clothing Factory of the Ministry of Military and Political Affairs, who are only good at making military uniforms. When the Ministry of Military and Political Affairs reduced the workload slightly, they could not maintain it, and the factory, like a flash in the pan, was liquidated at the end of last month. As for the silk cooperative factory jointly guided by the Social Affairs Bureau, the Zhongcan Company of the Ministry of Social Affairs, and the three agencies, the house repair has now been completed and is waiting to receive electricity to start work.

### Four Thousand Boxes of Japanese Silk Arrive in Shanghai; Resale to Resume This Week

A batch of 4,000 boxes of rayon obtained by the China Trust Bureau through barter trade with Japan arrived in Shanghai the other day. The Bureau's resale association is preparing to resume allocation to the silk weaving industry starting this week. The allocation amount will be decided at a meeting this morning. According to the person in charge of the association, the 4,000 boxes of rayon can last at least two months, with the Silk Weaving Joint Venture Company needing about 800 boxes per month and other factories needing about 1,000 boxes.

### Points to Note for Business Firms Adjusting Capital; Ministry of Finance Orders Shanghai Direct Taxation Bureau to Comply

The Shanghai Direct Taxation Bureau recently received an order from the Ministry of Finance: Upon investigation, the registered year of the capital amount of Category 1 Item A income and special excessive profit tax, as referred to in Paragraph 2 of Article 13 of the Income Tax Law, refers to the year in which the company's establishment registration was approved. If a change of registration has been made, it refers to the year in which the last change of registration was approved. In order to adapt to actual needs and facilitate calculation, the following points to note are specifically stipulated:

(1) If a company has increased its capital once or several times, its originally registered capital and the capital invested in each increase shall be adjusted separately. That is, the price index of the year of establishment registration or capital increase registration and the price index of the second year before the tax year shall be calculated separately according to the prescribed formula, and the adjusted amounts shall be combined to calculate the total capital amount.

(2) If a company's capital increase is based on the re-evaluated value of assets and no actual capital has been invested; or although a portion of new shares has been invested, and at the same time the original capital is re-subscribed to increase capital, the entire capital amount shall be adjusted according to law using the price index of the year of the last capital increase registration and the price index of the second year before the tax year.

(3) For companies established separately after the merger and surviving companies, their capital amounts shall be adjusted according to law using the price index of the year of establishment registration or change of registration after the merger and the price index of the second year before the tax year.

(4) If a company reduces its capital and has made one or several capital increase registrations before the capital reduction registration, the deduction of the capital reduction amount shall be based on the principle of deducting later increases first. If the capital increase amount before the capital reduction is not enough to deduct the entire capital reduction amount, then it shall be deducted in reverse order until the entire capital reduction amount is deducted, and then the remaining amount and the price index of each year shall be adjusted according to law using the price index of the second year before the tax year.

(5) The above four items shall also apply to residents and businesses that are not corporate organizations but should be subject to special excessive profit tax.

(6) For companies in the recovered areas, in addition to their capital registered in accordance with the law before the occupation, their original legal tender amount shall be adjusted according to law according to the price index of the original registered year and the price index of the second year before the tax year. The increased capital amount for which the change of registration has been processed in accordance with the Regulations on the Handling of Various Company Registrations in the Recovered Areas, or the capital amount for which the establishment registration has been processed, shall be adjusted using the price index of this change of registration or the year of establishment registration and the price index of the second year before the tax year.

(7) For non-corporate organizations in the recovered areas that should be subject to special excessive profit tax, in addition to their capital legally registered with the local competent commercial authority before the occupation, their original legal tender amount shall be adjusted according to law according to the price index of the original registered year and the price index of the second year before the tax year. The capital invested during the occupation period shall be adjusted according to the price index of the year registered with the local competent commercial authority after the recovery and the price index of the second year before the tax year.

### Qian Zhuang Industry to Form a National Federation

The National Federation of Banking Businesses was officially established in the capital the other day. It is learned that the Qian Zhuang industry has also begun to launch the National Qian Zhuang Business Federation. The Shanghai Qianye Guild has introduced Tai Runqing and others to engage in preparations, and will jointly prepare with the Qian Zhuang industry in major cities in order to quickly establish a collective organization of the National Qian Zhuang industry for the development of the industry.

### Representatives of the Southern Goods Industry Guild Petition to the Police and Social Affairs Bureaus Because the Seafood and Other Three Industries Refuse to Sell Goods

The Shanghai Seafood, Northern Goods, and Longan industry organized the "Three Industry Guilds Joint Regulation Office" to boycott the purchase of the Southern Goods industry. After the Southern Goods Industry Guild provided evidence of invoices for the soaring prices of the former three industries, the Municipal Police Bureau has sentenced the persons in charge of the firms that privately raised prices to detention for seven days, and the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau has ordered the revocation of the illegal organization "Three Industry Guilds Joint Regulation Office" and banned boycotts to maintain social order. However, although the dispute was once mediated and an agreement was about to be reached, the former three industries suddenly unanimously refused to sell goods to the Southern Goods industry starting the day before yesterday, causing the dispute to escalate. Therefore, all directors, supervisors, and member representatives of the Southern Goods industry petitioned to the Municipal Police Bureau and the Social Affairs Bureau, stating that the goods in Southern Goods stores are also daily necessities for the public. If they are considered non-essential goods and allowed to increase prices without standards, it will also have a major impact on people's livelihood. Now, the three industries dare to intensify their efforts, closing their doors and refusing to sell goods, attempting to make huge profits. They should request the competent leaders to provide relief, etc. At that time, the Chief of the Administrative Office of the Police Bureau, Fang, and the Section Chief of the Economic Section, Chen, received them, and stated that if there are violations of the law by privately raising prices, the Bureau will enforce the law. Those who have already been penalized will also be enforced according to law, etc. Later, the Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, Wu, personally received them, and instructed that the former illegal organization had been ordered to be revoked and banned from boycotting sales. He would investigate further and revoke the business licenses of five firms that were found to have evidence, etc. The petition group dispersed satisfied.

### January Import and Export Statistics Show a Decrease Compared to the End of Last Year

[Our Report] According to the customs statistics released the other day: The net value of China's imported goods in January of this year was 150,625,438,000 yuan. The net value of exported goods was 48,475,339,000 yuan. The import surplus in January was 102,150,099,000 yuan. Exports are about three times the imports. Compared with December of last year, the net value of imports and exports in January of this year both decreased. Imports decreased by 5,981,425,000 yuan, and exports decreased by 25,678,426,000 yuan. It can be seen from the above that the decrease in export value is particularly severe.

Among the values of various imported goods, the first place is oils, waxes, etc., totaling 22,632,528,000 yuan. The second place is paper and paper products, totaling 13,525,197,000 yuan. The third place is metals and ores, totaling 13,464,418,000 yuan. The fourth place is tobacco, totaling 12,846,158,000 yuan. The fifth place is wool and its products, totaling 11,172,464,000 yuan. The sixth place is chemical products and pharmaceuticals, totaling 8,882,700,000 yuan. Raw cotton, which used to occupy the first place in import value every month last year, has fallen to the seventh place, totaling 7,867,979,000 yuan.

Among the values of various exported goods, the first place is oils and waxes, totaling 11,854,608,000 yuan. The second place is animals and animal products, totaling 10,096,909,000 yuan. The third place is ores, metals, etc., totaling 5,044,588,000 yuan. The fourth place is textile fibers, totaling 2,555,642,000 yuan. The fifth place is piece goods, totaling 2,541,901,000 yuan.

### Large Denomination Bills Facilitate Use

A responsible person from the Sixth District Cotton Textile Industry Guild said: Recently, there have been widespread rumors of issuing large denomination bills, which has caused fluctuations in the market. In fact, during the agricultural product market season, a large amount of cash is needed to repay debts. Currently, water transportation is large everywhere, and transportation is difficult, and small denomination banknotes are inconvenient to carry. If large denomination bills are used instead, transportation can be facilitated, turnover can be accelerated, and the quantity of purchases can be increased, while reducing costs, which is beneficial to agriculture, industry, and commerce. Now, people in the market are suspicious, stimulating stocks and prices to rise. Their observations are not without error, and their psychology should be corrected so that the market can be stabilized and the national economy and people's livelihood can benefit.

### The Coal and Oil Industry Guild Held Its Inaugural Meeting Yesterday

The Shanghai Coal and Oil Industry Commercial Guild was previously approved by the Social Affairs Bureau to resume its establishment and began preparations in January of this year. On the one hand, oil companies and manager stores were solicited to participate, and everything was already in order. The Guild specially convened its inaugural meeting yesterday (the 20th) at 2:00 p.m. More than 30 oil merchant member representatives, including Guanghua Yuxin, attended, and representatives from the Social Affairs Bureau, the Municipal Party Department, and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce attended as observers. Chairman Ke reported on the Guild's preparations, followed by speeches from various representatives attending as observers. The charter was then passed, and directors and supervisors were elected, and the meeting adjourned at around 5:00 p.m.

### Hongji and Keelung Coal Supplies are Increasing

The supply of Vietnam's Hongji coal mine has been gradually increasing recently. The production of Taiwan's Keelung coal mine has gradually recovered, and the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has increased the number of ships for transportation. The supply of Kai Luan coal can also be increased, so the future of the entire fuel problem is quite optimistic.

### There is No Problem with Flour Supply; The Allocation Price Will Not Be Changed for the Time Being; The Government Stores 1 Million Bags of Flour for Emergency Use

Recently, food prices have generally risen, which has greatly affected people's livelihoods. Only flour, because of the regular allocation maintained by the Fuxin and other five major flour mills, has little impact on various kinds of pasta on the market. According to the allocationË¥üË¥£‰∫∫ of the five major flour mills, the allocated price of flour is still maintained at the negotiated price of 47,700 yuan per bag, and there has been no change. This price can definitely be maintained in the near future, and the allocation of flour will not be interrupted. Since each flour mill has obtained a government loan of 6 billion yuan, it has been able to purchase 130,000 dan of wheat every month, so there is definitely no problem with the supply of more than 10,000 bags of flour per day to the city. Moreover, this year's wheat production is about to mature. Even if each factory does not receive foreign wheat supplies, there will be no shortage of raw materials.

It is also learned that the government stores more than 1 million bags of foreign flour in Shanghai, so that if each flour mill fails to meet the needs of flour allocation, the Ministry of Food will allocate a portion for supply.

### Transportation Business Company Representatives Go to the Capital to Petition

The Shanghai Transportation Business Guild, due to the railway freight business office hindering the business of transportation merchants, once convened a general membership meeting to discuss countermeasures. It is now learned that the guild, based on the resolution of the general meeting, yesterday submitted appeals to the Shanghai Municipal Government, the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, the Municipal Council, the Municipal Party Headquarters, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Jiangsu Supervisory Commissioner's Office, the Songhu Garrison Headquarters, and other agencies. It also appointed representatives Li Mulian, Liu Chunlin, and others to go to the capital to petition. It is reported that representatives Pang Jufu and Mai Leshan from the Hangzhou Transportation Business Guild also arrived in Shanghai yesterday and will jointly proceed to the capital.

### Taiwan Alkali Manufacturing Company Can Supply Caustic Soda and Hydrochloric Acid

[Our Newspaper Report] According to an investigation by the Industry and Commerce Guidance Office: The demand for caustic soda in Shanghai is mainly from the dyeing and weaving, condiment, fertilizer, dye, paper making, and cosmetics industries. The highest annual demand is 123,850 barrels (300 kilograms per barrel). The current demand is 59,800 barrels.

The demand for hydrochloric acid is mainly from the condiment and dyeing and weaving industries. The highest annual demand is 300,000 boxes, and the current demand is 140,000 boxes. To solve the panic regarding these industrial raw materials, the Industry and Commerce Guidance Office has been contacting various parties for supply. Now, a person in charge of the Taiwan Alkali Manufacturing Company stated that Taiwan's caustic soda (available in 95% and 98% grades) can supply 100 tons per month. Hydrochloric acid (20 degrees) can supply 200 tons per month. The price of caustic soda is 20% lower than the market price.

For the above hydrochloric acid, the price for delivery in Taiwan is NT$1,300 per box (54 kilograms), including packaging and transportation costs. To assist private factories, the company has specifically entrusted the Industry and Commerce Office to distribute the products on its behalf, so that direct users can benefit and avoid hoarding and speculation by speculators. The office has scheduled a meeting for 3:00 PM today to discuss distribution matters with the heads of various industrial associations.

### Celluloid Industry in Shanghai Faces Difficulties Due to Lack of Raw Materials

[Our Newspaper Report] According to an investigation by the Industry and Commerce Guidance Office, the general situation of the celluloid industry in Shanghai is as follows:

(1) General Situation: There are a total of 63 members in the Shanghai Celluloid Industry Guild. The Great China Celluloid Factory, which could produce celluloid raw materials, has been shut down for a long time and therefore has not joined the guild. The Mei Hua Celluloid Manufacturing Factory, the Beautiful Mai Celluloid Factory, and the Guoguang Artificial Ivory Factory can also produce raw materials, but they only remelt old films. Mei Hua's highest monthly output is 20,000 pounds of celluloid sheets and 15,000 dozen fountain pen barrels, but the current actual output is only half of that. Beautiful's highest monthly output is 8,000 to 12,000 pounds of celluloid billiard ball material. Guoguang also manufactures finished products, so its raw material output is lower. Other celluloid factories only process domestically and foreign-made celluloid sheets.

Before the war, celluloid raw materials mostly relied on supply from Japan. Now, because the source of Japanese goods has been cut off, they can only use old films as a substitute.

(2) Products: The output of celluloid products, such as fountain pen barrels, toys, soap boxes, and buttons, is difficult to estimate.

(3) Raw Materials: Celluloid raw materials cannot be produced domestically from scratch. The following raw materials, except for nitrocellulose (or waste film) and _, can all be manufactured in China:

Raw Material Name: A. Nitrocellulose (or waste film) - Highest annual demand: 980,000 pounds (40 tons), B. Alcohol - 300,000 pounds, C. Amyl alcohol - 120,000 pounds, D. Iodine - 258,000 pounds, E. Zinc _ powder - 14,000 pounds (9 tons), F. _ Camphor - 384,000 pounds, G. Celluloid transparent sheets - 84,000 pounds, H. Standard ping-pong raw materials - 60,000 pounds, I. Various colored _ Celluloid sheets - 480,000 pounds.

Current annual demand: A. 150,000 pounds (70 tons), B. 45,000 pounds, C. 18,000 pounds, D. 38,700 pounds, E. 3,000 pounds (1.5 tons), F. 50,000 pounds, G. 12,600 pounds, H. 9,000 pounds, I. 270,000 pounds.

(4) Current Difficulties: 1. None of the celluloid factories in Shanghai are currently manufacturing nitrocellulose. However, to solve the problem of raw materials for the celluloid industry, a supply of nitric acid and sulfuric acid is necessary. 2. Members of the industry once bid for machinery for manufacturing celluloid raw materials from the Enemy Property Administration Bureau, which could produce 200 pounds per day, but it has not started operating in the six or seven months since due to the lack of electricity. 3. The industry hopes that foreign celluloid raw materials can continue to be imported with restrictions.

### Taiwan Construction Begins

‚Äî Taipei, 9th (Air Mail) - Special Correspondent Jiang Muyun

The Japanese occupied Taiwan for half a century, but construction only began in the last fifteen years. This process encountered setbacks at the end of the war, preventing its continued high development. Now, this presents us with a major test.

Taiwan is designated as a "Year of Production" this year. In conjunction with production, construction expenses account for 20% of the total budget of 4 billion. The authorities are clearly determined to complete the construction of a model province with facts. Construction can enhance the provincial people's understanding of the motherland.

However, just as construction was beginning, it encountered the February 28th Incident, a new typhoon in the construction project. It greatly discounted the enthusiasm of those who devoted themselves to work, and the source of work is currently drying up. This is a phenomenon of receding tide. Clarifying the current situation is a prerequisite for launching construction projects.

Cement Pavement Project

Total Budget of 9 Million US Dollars

The central task of construction on the island this year is the construction of the Zhudong Railway. The second is the construction of cement pavement on the island's trunk lines. The reporter will specifically introduce the cement pavement construction project.

Wu Wenxi, general manager of the engineering company who led the reporter to conduct on-site surveys between Xinzhuang and Taoyuan in the suburbs of Taipei, told me: Don't underestimate this highway "processing" project. Among the 390+ kilometers of the island's provincial highway, the cement and asphalt roads built by the Japanese are only 99 kilometers. There are still nearly 300 kilometers, and it is planned to complete it within seven years at a rate of 60 kilometers per year, with a total budget of 9 million US dollars.

Last November, General Manager Wu and Fei Hua, Director of the Public Works Bureau, started the construction of this major project in Xinzhuang. The original plan was to complete the section passing through 15 kilometers to Taoyuan, with a project cost of NT$33 million, but price increases forced it to increase to more than 42 million. It was originally scheduled to be completed at the end of March, but the February 28th Incident unexpectedly delayed the time to the end of May!

Xinzhuang to Taoyuan Section

Requires 3,500 Tons of Cement

When the reporters arrived in the small town of Xinzhuang, the highway was flying with gray sand. This area and Hsinchu are adjacent and are "windy" areas. General Manager Wu was worried about the fine sand piled up on the side of the highway, as it could not withstand the wind. This trip, he focused on observing the reconstruction of the roadbed after the torrential rain the night before. The most feared thing after the completion of the cement surface paving was heavy rain the next day, as it could not withstand the devastation of heavy rain during this period. But after a day, and after four weeks of drying in the shade, under the protection of water and sand, the clean, flat, and non-cracking road surface was revealed.

In this section, the Japanese had already paved half of it in the past. This time, only 13.9 kilometers are paved, with an average thickness of 15 centimeters. Both the upper and lower layers are made of concrete. The road surface is 6 meters wide, divided into full-width and two-thirds-width paving. The total length of the line is 83,400M2, which is equivalent to 12,510m3. As of April 5, 48,400M2 had been completed, and 35,000M2 remain to be completed. The materials needed are 3,500 tons of cement and 135 tons of steel bars, which are supplied by the Public Works Bureau. The rest are stones and laying sand, and fine sand have to be transported from more distant areas.

Cooperation Between Male and Female Workers

New Road Surface Guaranteed for 30 Years

At most, there were 7 mixing machines working within the 15 kilometers, but now only 4 continue to operate due to the difficulty in supplying cement. First, we carefully watched the workers work at Shiba Fen, 16 kilometers from Xinzhuang, at 17 kilometers, and in Guishan. Here, the spirit of cooperation between male and female workers is fully demonstrated.

Skilled technicians level the roadbed on the old stone road and erect wooden signs prohibiting military vehicles from passing. At the same time, wooden molds are installed with iron nails. Within the boundary of this wooden mold, pebbles of 2.5 to 10.5 inches are laid flat, which requires the use of 8-ton, 10-ton, and 12-ton road rollers. After that, the concrete coming out of the mixing machine (there are more than 100-foot mixing machines in the province, but this project uses small, movable machines) is laid on top manually. The steel bars are laid flat at all four corners using hand rollers or wooden rammers, and then cement is added like a barber applying oil. Finally, the wooden boards are used to level it, which is a process from rough lines to fine lines.

After the road surface is paved, it needs to be paved with 50cm-wide and 15cm-thick gravel road. A cement road surface can last for 30 years, but its greatest fear is water accumulation, as water is the enemy of all road surfaces.

Young Female Workers

Earn 100 Yuan in Daily Wages

At most, there were 1,200 workers, but now there are only more than 400 workers working on the road surface construction. Among them, about half are female workers. These female workers come from all over, and most of them are very young. They wear hats with powder and rouge, gloves on their hands, and wrap their legs with various scarlet fabrics under their bare feet. This is almost a miracle. They have a very aesthetic sense and are afraid that the ultraviolet rays of the subtropics will damage the beauty of their skin!

They carry stones and push cement carts skillfully on light railways, and use wooden boards to smooth the cement road surface. In their work, they have been taught to keep pace and work in batches habitually. In reality, this section requires 4170 male workers and 87570 female workers. Now 40,500 workers have been paid, and 46,500 more workers are needed. Assuming male workers are used, it can be halved. The efficiency of female workers is exactly half that of male workers.

Crowded in the ranks of workers, they retain a strong smell of cosmetics. They can earn 100 yuan per day, and the foreman can get an extra one-tenth, but the payment of wages does not go through this middleman. The construction business is also providing relief to the unemployed!

Using cement produced in Taiwan to build cement pavement clearly shows that Taiwan's highway construction is superior to that of any other province. Although such road surfaces are not ideal, they cannot be covered with asphalt, nor can they be mixed with brown color. But compared to military-style highways, it has undoubtedly embarked on advanced industrialized construction. There is a north-south railway line in the western part of the island, and there is also a highway parallel to it, which has special significance in transportation and national defense. Currently, adding cement construction to the stone highway will definitely greatly benefit the consumption of transportation, gasoline, and tires, and it is even more valuable than economy in education and transportation. It helps to improve the culture and living standards of the Taiwanese people who are happy!

Completing Construction Projects

Requires Capital and Sweat

Completing a construction project requires a huge amount of capital and the sweat of the workers. Zhuang Huai, the former director of the Public Works Office who was in charge of the project, resigned. Now Director Fei has appointed Chief Engineer Li Chunsong to concurrently manage the project. What he cares about most is the accumulation of water beside the cement road, while Manager Wu carefully corrects and supervises every step. The planned Public Works Bureau and the actual working engineering company are interdependent.

Director Fei used to work on the Sichuan-Shanxi Highway, and Manager Wu's most sophisticated masterpiece was the construction of the Le-Xi Highway (Leshan to Xichang), which cost 111 million yuan in 1940 and was completed within a time limit. This time, with the two of them processing and constructing the round-the-island highway, people should be full of optimism. But it is hoped that Taiwan can restore its previous situation, maintain the ambition of the workers, and even more hope that a stable political situation can guarantee the smooth completion of the high-grade road surface!

This work is arduous and great, and it provides facts for building a model province.

### International Spy: Eisler

‚Äî Translated by Zhu Qi

The well-known Comintern spy, Eisler, is a short, stocky Austro-Hungarian hybrid who looks like an old bookseller or a second-rate insurance salesman. With his half-bald head, glasses perched on his nose, and owl-like, unremarkable features, no one would believe he was the leader of the American Communist Party. When he was being interrogated in the House office building, he glared at the members of the Un-American Activities Committee who were questioning him and roared, "I am not a spy, not a foreign agent, and certainly not the leader of the Communist Party... I do not wish to swear under oath without prior warning."

However, other witnesses unanimously denounced him as a Comintern spy. His sister, Fischer, called him a "complete terrorist." They testified that he was connected to spies who leaked Canadian atomic secrets to the Soviet Union. Furthermore, others testified that he had worked alone as a spy. Based on all this evidence, the Un-American Activities Committee formally filed a lawsuit against him on charges of conspiring to overthrow the U.S. government, contempt of Congress, perjury, tax evasion, and passport forgery.

What kind of person is Eisler, the Comintern spy? What is his impact on American life? This is something not only Americans want to know, but perhaps people of other countries would also like to know.

A Moment of Glory

Eisler's father was a smart, hard-working scholar, but his earnings were not enough to support his family. His wife was a German woman he met while studying in Leipzig. He worked as a professor at the University of Vienna but ruined his career because he hated religion. He devoted himself to writing philosophical books, working 15 to 18 hours a day. Although he gained a good reputation, his income was meager and his livelihood precarious. His wife sometimes, for lack of money for supper, would secretly take some books from his bookshelf and give them to her daughter to sell. The hardship of their life can be imagined.

Eisler was the second son. He had an older brother and an older sister. The three of them were deeply resentful and frustrated by their father's failure in life, which drove them to embrace socialism. The eldest brother, Hans, is now a famous Hollywood composer, enjoying himself with music. Eisler and Fischer were avid readers and debaters. Fischer recalled that her brother in his youth was "bookish, fond of sports, cheerful, moody, arrogant, stubborn, and easily angered." Another Viennese said he had a sharp, satirical wit. When the Austrian princess made a statement during World War I, saying, "Since Viennese people peel sweet potatoes before eating them, I don't believe they will experience famine," Eisler retorted, "Since Your Majesty does not eat roasted goose with feathers, we certainly won't eat sweet potatoes with their skins."

During World War I, Eisler served on the Italian front, earning five medals and rising to the rank of lieutenant. At the end of the war, he quickly returned to Vienna and joined the Austrian Communist Party, working in organization, speech-making, and writing pamphlets. That was in 1918, when he was only 21 years old.

However, communism did not flourish in Austria. Eisler and his sister both grew up in Leipzig and, besides harboring ambition, also admired Germany. At that time, Austrian workers were joining the German Communist Party in droves, but intellectual leaders were scarce and in high demand. Fischer went to Berlin in 1919, and Eisler followed two years later. After they arrived in Germany, the Communist Party's policies became tortuous and internal strife erupted.

The German Communist Party split into left and right wings. Fischer was always considered smarter than her brother, and she was also sexually attractive. She quickly rose to become a leader of the left wing, becoming one of the prominent leaders of the German Communist Party at that time.

Concealing Identity

Eisler's intelligence matured more slowly than his sister's. He joined the right wing and became a confidant of the right-wing leader, Brandler. Soon he formed a centrist faction and appointed himself leader, aiming to reconcile the left and right wings. However, the party's center of gravity shifted to the right. Fischer and the left-wing members firmly opposed this trend. Lenin had strongly supported her. But in 1926, Stalin had her expelled and replaced her with Th√§lmann as the sole leader of the Communist Party.

Eisler continued to work diligently, giving eloquent speeches and writing, still ambitiously striving upward. In 1928, he saw an opportunity. Th√§lmann's brother-in-law was exposed in Hamburg for embezzling party funds. Eisler took the lead in attacking Th√§lmann, accusing him of accepting bribes and concealing the loot. He succeeded, and Th√§lmann was removed from his position as party leader.

In 1929, he went to China as a journalist, then soon returned home, retaining his original position until 1933. From then until 1939, when he was confined in Le Vernet, he organized underground work against Nazis in France, Switzerland, and Czechoslovakia. After that, he went to Mexico via the United States, where he wrote and contributed to magazines. He insisted that he was neither a member of the Comintern nor a spy of any kind.

Everyone who knew Eisler testified that this statement was a lie. Those familiar with the inner workings of the Communist Party were not surprised. A Communist Party member must sacrifice everything for the party. He must blindly obey the orders of the party leaders, especially those Communist Party members who rely on them for their livelihood. They must be prepared to carry out orders to steal, kill, betray friends, and even betray their own country.

After Eisler entered this dark world, he became a fully fledged Comintern spy. He was doubly enthusiastic, doubly cautious, and doubly suspicious of his enemies and friends, for two reasons: first, because he had opposed his comrade Th√§lmann, and second, because he was the brother of Fischer, who had been denounced by the Soviet Union as a Trotskyist. Although Eisler had repeatedly threatened to kill her, she was still his sister. In the era of terror, Eisler's face would turn pale when her name was mentioned.

For these reasons, Eisler tried to conceal his identity and his party affiliation. However, because he had been a professional revolutionary for a long time, he naturally had many old friends, old comrades, and estranged relatives who liked to talk about his deeds. At the same time, the police in various countries paid special attention to Eisler's activities.

Eisler did indeed go to China in 1929, but not as a journalist. At that time, President Chiang was implementing the purge. As a Comintern spy, Eisler was responsible for eliminating spies and dissidents within the party. In order to show Moscow his enthusiasm and loyalty, Eisler killed dozens of soldiers and civilians. When this news reached Germany, people gave him the nickname "Executioner."

Activities in America

Eisler set out for the United States from Paris in 1933, carrying an Austrian passport. His credentials and rank had been sent to New York in advance using code. Based on his success in China, Eisler expected to achieve even greater things in America.

Although Eisler had no particular relationship with President Roosevelt, he was very successful among Roosevelt's many staff members. The United States' recognition of the Soviet Union in 1933 changed the attitude of American liberals toward the American Communist Party, and at least outwardly changed the attitude of the American Communist Party toward liberals. The era of the Popular Front had arrived. Jefferson and Lincoln, along with Marx and Lenin, became heroes of the American Communist Party. All of this was beneficial to Eisler.

The Communist Party's usual tactic is to unite the petty bourgeoisie against a common enemy. Once that enemy is defeated, they then deal with the temporary allies. Eisler led his party members to engage in the following tasks: (1) infiltrating labor unions and other legitimate free organizations; (2) organizing Popular Front groups. They have had considerable success, at least controlling six unions of the Congress of Industrial Organizations and holding power in many other unions.

Eisler often traveled around under assumed names, engaging in investigation, speech-making, and organizing. In situations where he could not reveal his Communist Party identity, he won people's sympathy under the guise of a German exile. He thereby gained insight into American social life, the strengths and weaknesses of political parties, black and labor issues, and how to influence non-Communist individuals and groups.

Recently, when asked if he had ever faced any danger as the leader of the Communist Party, he shrugged and replied, "I have participated in street fights, been beaten up, led strikes, and led demonstrating crowds, but that's not considered any great danger. It's just part of the daily life of millions of Communists."

If a professional Communist Party member is indifferent to personal danger, then he is equally indifferent to friends, family, and country. He is not a patriot. He has a deep love for Germany, but he has never fulfilled the duties of a citizen. Like every Communist Party member, his first loyalty is to the Soviet Union.

Eisler first married the actress D√ºhrn in Vienna in 1920. They lived together for two years and divorced in 1926. She has remarried and lives in New York. In 1931, Eisler married his sister-in-law, Ella, in Vienna. Recently, a reporter from "Life" magazine found her impoverished and ill in Stockholm. According to her, she is still Eisler's wife, and since 1938, he has abandoned her and her daughter. The first request Ella made to the reporter was for Eisler's current address. She said, "He is one of the leading figures of the Comintern. He uses his organization to avoid me and let my daughter and I starve. He uses communism as a talisman and can always find an excuse. He is an extremely clever, witty, and interesting person, but he is isolated from society and reality."

He is now living with a beautiful young woman named Brunhilda, but they are not married. They both left France for the United States in 1941. The American and Mexican authorities in Marseille jointly issued a travel permit. So they knew about this.

Eisler is undoubtedly the Comintern's representative in the United States. But he is more carefully concealing his identity and mission than before. He lives in a simple apartment. His public activities are limited to the "Joint Anti-Fascist Refugee Committee," and he is sure to go to the meeting office almost every morning at nine o'clock.

He has never been to the Communist Party headquarters, but he issues orders to party leaders anytime, anywhere, sometimes using unsigned notes, sometimes in parks, sometimes in restaurants. Most party members are unaware of this.

During the war, the American Communist Party adopted a policy of class truce. After the war ended, Moscow ordered the resumption of class struggle. Eisler was ordered to implement the new policy, which had three main objectives: (1) to incite Americans to distrust British and American foreign policy and to defend the Soviet Union's expansionist policy; (2) to weaken the possibility of the United States waging war against the Soviet Union; (3) to eliminate the American capitalist system. Eisler often wrote articles under the pseudonym Hans Berger in the "Daily Worker" attacking American foreign policy.

Recently, Eisler shifted his focus to American artists, writers, and intellectuals, getting them to support the Communist Party's policies. His brother, Hans, who composed the music for the "Comintern" anthem and other Marxist propaganda music, is now a popular composer in Hollywood, helping his brother to win over a group of literary and artistic figures.

Eisler seems to have given up hope that the class consciousness of American workers will develop enough to cause a Russian-style revolution. His hope now lies in the farmers and the middle class. Regardless of Eisler's fate, Americans believe that other Eislers and their followers will continue to vigorously promote their established policies through strikes, demonstrations, and propaganda.

### The Determination Underneath the Strata: Guangxi's Industrial and Mining Undertakings Re-emerge with New Sprouts

‚Äî By Liang Xiaozhong, Our Correspondent in Guilin, November 11th (Airmail)

The barrenness on the surface often cannot conceal the treasure trove of wealth underground. The entire terrain of Guangxi can be said to encompass mountains from any historical period. Buried within these myriad deep ravines are countless precious resources‚Äîan inexhaustible number of mineral deposits. As long as they can be properly managed, transitioning from poverty to abundance is as easy as bending a finger. Those who possess a fortune of gold at home but are unaware of it and beg for help are understandable. However, those who own millions in assets but do not know how to utilize them are nearing pessimism. Nevertheless, people throughout Guangxi know how to drive the old ox cart onto a better path. Here, let the reporter tell you a little about the "mineral status" underneath Guangxi's strata, and a rough sketch of "how people are turning into mutual benefactors":

Tin, Tungsten, Antimony, Lead: Focus on Increasing Production

Guangxi's mineral products are most famous for tin, tungsten, antimony, and lead, among which tin and tungsten are particularly favored by nature. Before and after the war, they were consistently in high demand on the international market. Even during the war, many unscrupulous merchants took great risks to smuggle them to Hong Kong and Guangdong for sale, and the enemy used these raw materials to make weapons to slaughter our compatriots. These four types of mineral deposits are mainly concentrated and abundant in Fuchuan and He County in eastern Guangxi, as well as the Hechi and Nandan areas in northern Guangxi. Government and commercial operations engaged in mining also take this as their primary target. According to reliable surveys: the tin ore reserves reach 1,992,514 metric tons, tungsten ore is approximately 994,944 metric tons, antimony ore is 1,081,292 metric tons, and lead is approximately 5,200,000 metric tons. Last year, when the lost territories were initially recovered, the mines were severely damaged. The production of tin sand could still maintain an output of 8,176 metric tons. Its richness, except for Jiangxi, is probably unmatched by few other places. The sales of tungsten and tin all rely on exports to Hong Kong and Southeast Asia. There are officially stipulated prices in the production areas, but once they are exported, their value increases tenfold, and merchants scramble to purchase them. However, up to now this year, the output of commercially operated mines is only between 500 and 700 tons, whereas last year it was more than 8,000 tons. The impact of soaring costs and prices has led to a sense of decline. Antimony and lead are mostly sold domestically to neighboring provinces. Antimony products have beautiful styles (Guilin is famous for making woks and other items, which are extremely popular with visitors) and sell very well. The authorities have made great efforts to maintain these special mineral products. Relief for mine owners is sometimes discovered. However, the organization with the largest scale of mining is the government-run Pinggui Mining Bureau (co-operated by the provincial government and the Resources Committee, located in Xiwang). It has the most modern power plants, large coal mines, and tin smelting plants. As of the end of March this year, it has produced 8,915 metric tons of tin and 2,153 metric tons of crude tin, and the output is increasing daily. It is currently expanding mineral exploration, which could increase production by two-fifths. The prospects for tin production are indeed optimistic.

Guangxi Coal Production: Second to None

The source of power‚Äîcoal production in Guangxi can be said to be second to none in South China. The already surveyed reserves have reached a massive 110,435,900,000 metric tons, with production areas scattered throughout the province. Both traditional and modern mining methods are used everywhere. Among them, the Heshan Coal Mine and the Pinggui Mining Bureau are considered the giants. However, even these so-called giants have pitifully low output. The Pinggui Mining Bureau's annual output last year was only 14,687 metric tons, and the Heshan Coal Mine (a joint government-commercial venture located in Laibin) was only about 10,000 tons. Privately operated coal mines produce a total of 5,143 metric tons. However, this small amount of coal constrains the lifeline of the entire Xiang-Gui-Qian Railway. The Guiliu section and the Liuyi section currently in operation truly "cannot be without this gentleman for a day." When the coal production is insufficient, the locomotives even burn glory for fuel, isn't that laughable! Fortunately, vast coalfields have recently been discovered in the central Guangxi area, and it is said that their reserves are incalculable. A loan of 400 million yuan was requested from the Four Banks Joint Office for exploitation, but after much begging, only 100 million was obtained, and goods have become more expensive. What happens next remains to be seen.

The Entire Southern Guangxi: A Gold Zone

Of all the mines, what makes people most enthusiastic is the gold mine. Last year, for 360 days, gold prospectors took more than 5,000 taels of yellow metal from the deep mountains. Government officials extracted more than 16,500 taels of raw gold from the Shanglin Gold Mine. What about this year? There are no definite figures this year. However, since the beginning of spring, gold diggers have been frantically heading to the mountains and ridges in a spring dream. The entire southern Guangxi land is a gold zone (Huaiji and Xindu in eastern Guangxi also produce gold). Before the war, there were more than 300 large and small mines. Some went bankrupt because of this, while others rose to prominence. Some say that mining is a gamble. Often, those with strong capital control the outcome. However, it is also a fact that the "bosses" who take a cut definitely earn countless amounts of money. Currently, it is estimated that there are still more than 40 scattered gold mines, among which there are no lack of secret mining and "forced mining." The mine tax is too much of a headache.

In addition, there is sulfur ore, with an annual output of more than 34,000 metric tons. There are also more than 24 million metric tons of iron ore underground waiting to be used (speaking of iron, one cannot help but think of the "trivial matter" of the common people playing with iron. In mountainous counties, countless people often take earth-cast iron and forge not-so-bad machine guns, rifles, carbines, and pistols, which are scattered among the vast bandit and traitor groups. In Wuxuan County alone, there are 40 such "arsenals," the seriousness of which can be imagined). Everything is a matter of wealth, only depending on how long people's hands are and how far-sighted the government's vision is.

Technical and Economic: Two Major Aids

As of recently, after the provincial government's efforts to supervise and guide, there are already more than 100 large mines and more than 20 small mining areas that have resumed production (there were more than 500 large mining areas and 600 small mining areas in the past). On the one hand, the authorities are requesting technical and financial assistance from the Economic and Financial Departments. At the same time, the Relief Administration is successively allocating equipment to various mining areas. Currently, more than 30 companies have received allocations. It is also heard that the Executive Yuan has ordered the Relief Administration to investigate the current situation of mining areas in Guangxi, preparing to transfer a large number of technical personnel and equipment to assist in construction. This is undoubtedly a powerful aid to Guangxi's industrial and mining undertakings that are re-emerging with new sprouts. As long as the hard-working spirit of the Guangxi people does not fade away, turning a barren land into a paradise on earth in ten or five years is not a difficult task.

A Humble Proposal for Improving Traffic in This City

Since the victory, although the authorities have repeatedly implemented rectification measures for traffic in the central district, it has not yet been resolved. According to the Public Works Bureau, this is all due to the lack of public vehicles and the large increase in pedicabs and rickshaws. However, according to the authorities' recent announcement, the number of municipal public buses has increased to 167, which is comparable to the number before the war under British merchants. Why is the traffic situation still not as good as before the war? The biggest reason for this is that the public bus routes are still not appropriate. The congestion of pedicabs and rickshaws in the central district is due to two reasons: first, it is inconvenient for residents of various districts to travel to the central district by public bus, and second, traffic in the northern and southern districts of the Suzhou Creek must pass through the central district. Therefore, the current increase in routes should be based on solving the above-mentioned traffic problems and dispersing pedicabs and rickshaws to various districts. For example, taking Route 9 as an example, its terminal is in the New World, but most passengers' destinations are the centralized industrial and commercial organizations east of Henan Road. If they have to wait for another bus or walk after getting off, it is both troublesome and time-consuming. They would rather take a rickshaw directly from their starting point to their destination. In this case, even if there are hundreds of routes, it would only cause pedicabs to stay in the central district for a long time, engaging in business within the district. It not only cannot solve congestion but also increases congestion. The Public Works Bureau's intention to prevent Routes 9 and 7 buses from entering the central district is to avoid delays and losses due to limited time, but it is unwilling to fulfill its mission of solving congestion in the central district, which is a great loss to the purpose of improving city traffic to benefit the people. Looking back at the time of the former concessions, Nanjing East Road had three public bus routes, Zhengdong East Road had five routes, and Beijing East Road had two routes, all of which penetrated deep into the central district. It was very convenient for citizens to travel to and from the central district, and few took rickshaws, so the central district did not have the current congestion, which can serve as a lesson from the past.

I have lived in Shanghai for fifteen years and am familiar with the traffic situation due to my work. Now, I am taking the time to make the following sincere suggestions, hoping that the authorities can adopt them.

(1) Existing routes that need to be reformed:

(A) Route 9 ‚Äî From the New World, follow Nanjing East Road to the Bund, and set up a terminal next to the Huizhong and Cathay Hotels, and cancel the winding route between Xizang Road and Wusheng Road.

(B) Route 7 ‚Äî The current terminal crosses the Waibaidu Bridge, follows Zhongshan East 1st Road, turns west onto Nanjing East Road, West Road, turns south onto Huangpi North Road, South Road, turns west onto Fuxing Middle Road, and the terminal circles around the intersection of Linsen Middle Road and Baoqing Road, serving as a direct transportation station between the Old French Concession and the North District. (C) Route 4 ‚Äî From the current terminal, follow Beijing East Road, turn west, then south onto Fanwangdu Road to Jing'an Temple, serving as a transportation line between the East District and the West District.

(2) Proposed routes:

(A) From Yichang Road Bridge, follow Jiangning Road, turn east onto Kangding Road, Huaian Road, turn south onto Zhongzheng North 2nd Road, turn east onto Xinzha Road, Beijing East Road to Huangpu Park.

(B) From Zhongshan North Road in Zhabei, follow Shixing Road, turn south onto Baoshan Road, Henan North Road over the bridge, turn east onto Beijing East Road, turn south onto Zhongshan East 1st Road, 2nd Road, Zhongshan South Road to Dongjiadu, connecting Zhabei and Nanshi.

(C) From Taiyang Temple Road in Zhabei, follow Datong Road, turn east onto Xinjiang Road, turn south onto Manzhou Road, turn east onto Kulun Road, turn south onto Xizang North Road, Middle Road, South Road, turn east onto Linsen East Road, Minguo Road, and then turn east onto Fangbang East Road to the 16th Pier.

(3) Every time municipal bus drivers reach the terminal, they must get off and rest, waiting for the time to be adjusted before starting. However, due to the different levels of traffic congestion along the way, there are often six or seven vehicles stopping at the terminal at the same time. Passengers wait for a long time without the bus starting, which is a huge waste. On the other hand, the French Concession's Route 22 bus does not have rigid time regulations, adjusts itself along the way, and departs as soon as it arrives at the terminal. Before their shift ends, drivers never get off to rest (stopping at each station is already a rest, compared to long-distance buses that run for several hours, there is really no need to rest at the terminal). The vehicles do not have problems of disconnection and congestion. Even British merchants before the war did not have this example.

If the above routes can be adjusted one by one, the number of pedicabs and rickshaws entering the central district can be reduced, and the congestion problem can be solved completely. (Li Zuoyuan)

Spring and Autumn

### A Strange Encounter the Night Before Trial

‚Äî By Anton Chekhov, Translated by Lin Fengzao

The coachman turned around and pointed his whip at a wild rabbit crossing the road, saying, "We seem to be out of luck, sir." Even without this bad omen, I knew there was little hope because I was about to go to the nearby court to be tried for bigamy. The weather was terrible. When I arrived at the station for the night, I was covered in snow, as if I had already been tortured. After a tedious journey in the dilapidated carriage, I felt cold, damp, and numb.

Arriving at the station, I saw the stationmaster. He was a tall man, wearing dark blue striped trousers, and looked like he hadn't had enough sleep. His head was already bald. His mustache seemed to grow out of his nostrils, so his sense of smell might not be very good‚ÄîI daresay. There were so many foul smells. The stationmaster muttered, hummed through his nose, scratched his head, opened the door, and didn't say a word. He only pointed with his elbow to where I would be resting for the night. I smelled sealing wax and something very pungent, almost suffocating. On the table was a tin lamp, constantly smoking, barely illuminating the unpainted board walls.

I walked into the room, put my travel bag on the table, and said to the stationmaster, "Sir, there's an unpleasant smell here." The stationmaster took a long breath, shook his head, and said, "The smell is always the same." He scratched his head again and said, "You smell it because you've just come in from the frosty outdoors."

I dismissed the man and began to inspect my temporary lodging. The sofa I would be sleeping on was wide, like a double bed, covered with cold oilcloth. Besides the sofa, there was a large iron stove, a table (the one I mentioned above), a pair of someone else's felt boots, a satchel, and a screen that cornered off one part of the room. Someone was sleeping soundly behind the screen. I looked around and made the bed, then started to undress. Soon, my nose became accustomed to the smell. I took off my coat, trousers, and boots, then hopped around the iron stove to warm up, alternately raising and lowering my bare legs. I immediately felt warmer. Finally, all that was left to do was to unfold the sofa and go to sleep‚Äîbut that's when something strange happened.

My gaze suddenly stopped at the corner enclosed by the screen. I saw a woman's head behind the screen, with disheveled hair, dark eyes, and a faint smile. You can imagine how surprised I was. Her dark eyelashes were fluttering, and she had dimples, as if she was smiling. I became uncomfortable. She realized I had seen her and also became uncomfortable, so she hid. I lay down on the sofa and covered myself with my coat.

I felt responsible for what had happened. How terrible, I thought to myself, she must have seen me hopping around‚Äîthat wasn't a pretty sight. The thought of her sweet face made me involuntarily dream. Image after image filled my imagination, each one more beautiful and charming than the last. A burning pain suddenly flared up on my right cheek, as if it were a punishment for having bad thoughts. I touched my right cheek, and although I didn't find anything, I knew what the problem was.

At this moment, I heard the woman's voice: "What to do about these annoying bedbugs? They seem to want to devour me."

Then I remembered that I had a good habit of always carrying Keating's Insect Powder when traveling. This time, I hadn't forgotten to pack it in my luggage. I immediately took the tin box of powder out of my travel bag. As long as I gave this powder to the beautiful woman, we could get to know each other. But how to give it to her?

"How terrible!" I heard her exclaim again.

So I said softly, "Madam, I heard you crying out, and I know you're being bothered by bedbugs. I happen to have some Keating's Insect Powder. If you want it, I'll‚Äî"

"Yes, I want it."

"I'll bring it right away. I'll put on my coat and bring it over," I said happily.

"No, no, just pass it over the screen. There's no need to come over here."

"I'll just pass it over the screen. Don't be afraid, I'm not a drunken traveler."

"Who knows? You're a stranger."

"Alright then. It wouldn't be a problem even if I walked behind the screen. Besides, I'm a doctor," I immediately told a lie. "Doctors, police detectives, and women's hairdressers can go to private places without needing to avoid them."

"Are you really a doctor? Really?"

"Please believe me. So, will you allow me to bring the powder over?"

"Alright, if you're a doctor, do as you please. But why bother? I can ask my husband to come over to you." She paused for a moment and whispered loudly, "Phileas, wake up, you seal! Get up, and go outside the screen. This doctor is very kind and wants to give us bedbug powder."

Hearing that there was someone behind the screen named Phileas, I couldn't help but be taken aback. My heart was filled with disappointment; the hammer of a gun might feel the same disappointment when a bullet misfires. I felt ashamed, annoyed, and regretful. I was stunned; when this Phileas came out from behind the screen, he looked like a rogue to me. I almost cried for help. Phileas was a tall man, all skin and bones, about fifty years old, with a grizzled beard, thin lips pressed tightly together, and fine blue veins all over his nose and temples. He was wearing pajamas and slippers.

He took the insecticide powder, went back behind the screen, and said, "Thank you, thank you. You're too kind, Doctor. Are you also being bothered by bedbugs?"

"Yes," I said. I sank back onto the sofa and covered myself with my coat. "Yes, really."

I heard him talking to his wife: "Sirotchka, there's a bedbug running on your nose; let me get it off."

"Go ahead," Sirotchka said, laughing. Then she cried, "You didn't catch it! And you call yourself a senator! Everyone is afraid of you, but you can't even catch a bedbug!"

"Be quiet, Sirotchka, don't forget there's a stranger here. You always say things you shouldn't."

"These little beasts won't let you sleep," I grumbled angrily, not knowing why.

The couple gradually fell asleep. I closed my eyes, determined not to think about anything, and get a good night's sleep. Half an hour passed, an hour passed, but I couldn't fall asleep.

Finally, my neighbors began to stir, murmuring complaints to each other.

Phileas complained, "It's strange, even this insecticide powder isn't working very well. There are too many bedbugs."

Then, he called to me, "Doctor, Sirotchka wants me to ask you, why does this bedbug smell so strange?"

We started talking. We talked about bedbugs, the weather, the Russian winter, medicines‚Äîthough my knowledge of medicines was as incomplete as my knowledge of astronomy. We also talked about Edison.

Then, I heard him gently admonish his wife, "Sirotchka, you don't need to be shy. He's a doctor. Don't be embarrassed; ask him. There's nothing to be afraid of. Doctor Shevyatov couldn't do anything, but maybe this doctor can."

"You ask him," Sirotchka said softly.

Phileas then said to me, "Why does my wife's chest always hurt? You know, she always coughs and feels a heaviness in her chest, as if something is stuck there."

"That requires a long explanation, not something that can be covered in a few words," I said. I tried to avoid the question.

"What does it matter if the explanation is long? We have plenty of time; we can't sleep anyway. Good doctor, please examine her. I must tell you, Doctor Shevyatov examined her. He's a good man, but I don't quite believe what he said. No, I don't believe it; however, I feel that you wouldn't give us such an optimistic diagnosis. I ask you to examine her, and in the meantime, I'll go to the stationmaster and ask him to get the tea stove ready."

Phileas put on his slippers and went out. I walked behind the screen. Sirotchka was sitting on a wide sofa, surrounded by many pillows, and she was pulling at her lace collar.

I sat beside her, furrowing my brow, and said, "Please show me your tongue." She showed me her tongue and started to laugh. Her tongue was normal‚Äîred. I took her pulse, mumbling "Hmm," although I didn't feel her pulse at all. I can't remember what else I asked about her smiling face. I only remember that when the examination was over, I felt like a fool and didn't want to ask any more questions.

Phileas returned. The three of us drank tea. I wrote out a prescription, following the way doctors write prescriptions, as far as I knew. (Written carelessly.)

Like this „Äá.05 centimeters

World's Glory 1 centimeter

Distilled water 10 cubic centimeters

One tablespoon every two hours

Mrs. Shiyeva

Prescribed by Dr. Chekhov

The next morning, as I was about to leave, I stood with my travel bag, saying goodbye to my newfound friends. I thought I would never see them again. Phileas stopped me and insisted that I accept a ten-ruble note.

He said, "Please accept it. I always pay for honest work. You studied, you worked. I know it. Your knowledge was earned through sweat."

I had no choice but to accept the money. That's how the night before my trial went.

The court door opened, and the bailiff told me to take the defendant's seat; I'm not prepared to describe the mood at that time. My face turned green, my head felt dizzy, and looking around, I saw thousands of eyes staring at me. I seemed to hear my own funeral bell. I looked at the solemn and important faces of the jury.

I saw a table covered with a red cloth, and in the prosecutor's seat, I saw someone‚Äîyou know who it was‚ÄîPhileas! I cannot describe my horror, nor can you imagine it. He was writing. As I looked at him, I thought of bedbugs, Sirotchka, my prescription‚ÄîI not only felt a chill on my spine but also the entire Arctic Ocean.

After Phileas finished writing, he looked up and glanced around. At first, he didn't recognize me. His eyes widened, his jaw dropped, and his head shook. He slowly stood up and gave me a cold look. For some reason, I also stood up and stared back at him.

"Defendant, please tell the court your name and occupation," the bailiff began to say.

The prosecutor drank some water and sat down. Sweat beaded on his forehead.

"This is a fine kettle of fish, this is awful," I thought. I knew the prosecutor wanted to take revenge on me. He repeatedly went through the written evidence, muttering to himself.

But I can stop writing here. This is being written during the lunch break in court. After the break, the prosecutor will speak immediately.

Oh, heavens, what will he say?

Note: Chekhov is a playwright but also a short story writer. This story, written with a few light strokes, has a unique charm. It was published in 1868, but only recently has there been an English translation. This translation is based on Anna Heifetz's translation from the Slavic language department of the New York Public Library, from the American Mercury magazine last December. Translator's note.

### On Poetry

‚Äî Bolo

In "The Cycle of Spring," Tagore says, "We liberate humanity from the shackles of their desires." Hegel says, "The purpose of poetry is to place the ultimate ideal form of the conscious universe into the form of imagination." From these points, we can know that poetry is a kind of truth and reason.

### Corelli's Humor

‚Äî Shen Si

The English poet Marie Corelli (1855-1924), whose parents were both Italian, was raised by the English poet Charles Mackay from a young age. After becoming an adult, she decided to remain unmarried for life. Her friends were very surprised, so they asked her, and she replied, "I have no need to marry! What would I need a husband for? I have three things in my house, and they all serve the purpose of a husband. One is a dog, which barks incessantly every morning; another is a parrot, which chatters and curses incessantly every afternoon; and the last is a cat, which always comes home in the middle of the night."

### On the Shandong Road

‚Äî Xi Shan

Those who have read "The Heroic Sons and Daughters" should remember the singing girl whom Master An met in the inn. That was the most touching scene on the old north-south roads, but it was also accumulated by countless sad tears. Since there have been shipping lanes and railways, fewer people pass by, and the rouge and powder of beautiful women adds more infinite emotion to the feelings of ancient times. This place is the western border of the state of Qi, I am afraid that the singing of the horse is a custom.

However, this kind of literature is rarely seen. Only at the end of the Guangxu period did Zhang Wenhu of Nanhui have a realistic record in his diary. It is said that these prostitutes become seamstresses when they get a little older. The misery of their economic life can be imagined. Zhang's diary is called "Mengyin Lu," and it is a valuable book. In the early years of the Guangxu period, the Wang family of Qinghe carved "Xiaofang Yuzhai Yudi Congchao," which collected many travel diaries, but without this book. A brief summary is as follows:

"From Yinping to the north, a guest enters the shop, and the doors are filled with harp players. Their ages range from eleven or twelve to seventeen or eighteen. Without waiting for the guest's orders, they begin playing licentious music, and the guests reward them with dozens of real coins, and their cheeks are filled with smiles. When they are a little older, they make a living by mending clothes. Their faces are thin, and they apply thick makeup, and the drivers and servants regard them as a gentle village. Scholars laugh at them, but they do not know that they are the same people who used to play the harp. I wrote four verses to the tune of 'Yellow Oriole':

"The north-south road is long, especially in the cold winter with ice and snow. In my sorrow, I suddenly see the peach blossoms smiling, with painted eyebrows and powdered faces, embracing a pipa with half a red sleeve, strumming and plucking, slender and graceful.

Smiling as they enter the shop, sitting in a slanting row, the sound of the four strings, telling of love and passion, urging a few cups of village wine, drifting like clouds and flowing water, do not blame them, constantly lingering. These are all pitiful people, falling into misery.

Young and knowing of spring, what female work have they ever learned? Greedy for money and indifferent to customs, valuing money and knives, witches raising, Wushan that peak, sending their youth to inns and stations, so hasty, red faces are like dreams, and in the blink of an eye they are mending clothes.

The hotel is very boring, happy to see the carriage resting temporarily. The wine star enters the seat, and the flower star shines. Singing loudly, with great passion, the fragrance of flowers enters the wine, and the cold is swept away, drunk and dizzy, a dream on the rope bed, and tomorrow the horse's hooves are far away."

Wenhu was a thorough Confucian scholar who lived through the four reigns of Daoguang, Xianfeng, Tongzhi, and Guangxu. He first studied with Ruan Yuan, Hu Peihuan, and Chen Huan, and was able to inherit the family traditions of the pragmatic learning of the Qianlong and Jiaqing periods. However, after middle age, he associated with Li Shanlan and Rong Hong in Shanghai, and thus made friends with Western scholars living abroad, such as Joseph Edkins. He originally had a thorough understanding of astronomy and mathematics, and had already gained an understanding of Western science from books. Combined with modern knowledge, he became the first person to be well-versed in both Chinese and Western learning, and used his Chinese Confucianism to understand Western learning. Zeng Guofan's advocacy of Western learning after the Tongzhi period was probably influenced by Zhang the most, in addition to Li and Rong, because only his kind of writing and learning could move Zeng's ears. I record his sending of Rong Chunfu to the United States as follows:

"The earth is thirty thousand miles thick, its circumference is three. From here to Batavia, the road is really half the earth, in the four directions of the world, it alone forms a continent. Although the United States is a rising power, it is comparable to England and France. They establish laws like the Khitans, selecting the worthy and consulting with the public. How worthy is George Washington, whose laws are still followed today." There is also a poem sending Li Renshu to the Tongwen Guan:

"Western methods are gradually becoming new, and logarithms are already called divine; Since the book of Loomis was translated, the former sages sighed and piled wood. (Note: Differential and integral calculus was written by Loomis of the United States)

Laws, measures, and weights are inherently connected, who from Mozi traced the remaining books? The book was carefully translated by Hu Weili, and machines are not as important as studying first. (Note: The Englishman Hu Weili wrote Seventeen Volumes on Important Studies)"

Zhang and Chen of Lingnan were the only remaining pragmatic scholars of the early Guangxu period, and they were able to devote themselves to astronomy, arithmetic, and music. Zhang assisted Jinshan Qian Xizuo in printing Shoushan Ge Congshu, and continued to compile Yihai Zhuchen, Xiaowan Juanlou Congshu, etc., and his contribution to collecting literature was particularly great. This was also because he was born in Jiangnan and was not disturbed by official affairs.

His poems and lyrics, however, are very interesting, as described above. I especially like the cleverness of his couplets, such as the one in the Maitreya Hall: "Hey, the people in here are so happy; Alas, where do the outsiders come from?" Such as the one in Tang Liuru's studio: "After death, right and wrong, blind women and villagers talk nonsense; Before their eyes, fame and noise, how much money are scholars worth?" Such as the one in the study: "Opening a book is beneficial, focusing one's mind." They are also good stories.

### Landscape

‚Äî Courbet

Courbet (1819-1877) was a leader in resisting traditional idealism and advocating realistic life.

He hoisted the banner of "Realism," expressing the beautiful things and true states that his eyes could see. Using his wonderful and skilled techniques, he expressed the objects he saw on the canvas. The European art scene in the nineteenth century was painted with a thick and deep line by him.

His figures, landscapes, and still lifes all have a sense of reality. Like a photograph, there is no trace of subjective and serious depiction of the "form" of objects. Even non-beautiful elements are in his description. This is what is called pure realism. (Lion)

### An Inch of Mountains and Rivers, an Inch of Blood 264

‚Äî Ye Jingfeng

When Tsurumi arrived at the International Hotel, he just wanted to rest for a while, but a hotel attendant reported that someone wanted to see him. The visitor was handsome and taller than Tsurumi by half a head. Just meeting him, this elegant and calm demeanor dispelled Tsurumi's fatigue, and he felt a sudden surge of energy.

"Sorry, I arrived half an hour early"; the visitor spoke fluent Japanese, with a soft, rounded voice, containing ten parts of firm strength.

"Welcome, welcome..."‚ÄîTsurumi shook the visitor's hand warmly and did not let go, "I am Tsurumi Tama, you must be Mr. Zeng Shouyi?" Speaking the second half of the sentence, Tsurumi changed to a Beijing accent.

Tsurumi had already received a report from Masaiwa about Shouyi's character and the general situation of Baininzhuang. Tsurumi felt that there was no need to hide anything from Shouyi, so within ten minutes, he had already told him everything, thoroughly explaining everything to Shouyi. Shouyi also expressed his sincerity at seeing him for the first time. These two young men met each other with pure and frank sincerity.

During the conversation, Tsurumi, like a young lady, showed off his personal treasures, introducing Kiko, Torashiro, and several other comrades to Shouyi one by one.

"There is a comrade surnamed Yu in our village, who probably knows one of Mr. Yue's in your department. I heard that they were old classmates." Shouyi mentioned the general situation of reporter Yue and the department, which Masaiwa had told him‚Äîalso because I exposed the secret of Miyazaki Sadao for him..."

"It can be seen that we should all be comrades." Tsurumi always wanted to ask Baininzhuang to join his organization.

"Of course, we are all comrades, there is no doubt about that."

"Then, if we have any requests, your comrades will certainly not refuse!"

"As long as it does not conflict with our company's principles‚ÄîI don't think there will be any conflict‚Äîwe will definitely be able to cooperate fully." Shouyi drew a very clear dividing line for the boundaries of cooperation. "I also have a small contribution: under a common big goal, we can unite various comrades' small groups to cooperate, but there does not have to be a certain superficial command..."

"Those who can be united must have similar interests, and there must be one or two intermediaries. Once something happens, and the power of a certain group must be applied, it can be notified by this intermediary. This is what I call 'cooperation of labor'. There are many conveniences in this: on the one hand, we can unite various comrades groups, spiritually connected, and sharing information; on the other hand, the various groups can maintain their own freedom of action, and do not need a certain group to bear all the responsibilities, etc."

Shouyi's "small contribution" on the one hand explained the will of Baininzhuang, and on the other hand, it was because he saw the disappointment in Tsurumi's expression, so he had to give him this explanation, and it was also to give him some comfort.

"...Very right; very right... I never thought of this before..." Tsurumi seemed to be suddenly enlightened.

"It's not that you didn't think of it, but you couldn't think of it!" Shouyi smiled.

"How do you say that?" Tsurumi looked at Shouyi innocently, as if he and Shouyi had grown up together since childhood.

Dr. Chihuei summarized the ethical thought of Schiller's last play, saying:

"The embodiment of fighting for freedom and fighting for brightness is revolution. Although revolution inevitably involves bloodshed, the difference is that one is self-defense, is forced, is fighting for just rights, is for the public; the other is not self-defense, is not forced, is purely desire, is selfish."

From this correct and powerful view, we can use it to recognize the lofty and solemn spirit of the great poet Schiller, and further study Schiller's last play, Wilhelm Tell. I can't help but have a series of thoughts.

Grand Historian Sima Qian said it well: "Death can be as heavy as Mount Tai, or as light as a feather; the direction of its use is different." Death is the same, but it cannot be equated, because the weight of Mount Tai cannot be equal to a feather.

The death of achieving benevolence and taking righteousness, and the "self-destruction" of doing many unrighteous things, are too far apart.

### Rambling Talks on Solitude

‚Äî Wang Cong

I think‚Äî‚Äî

Many "glories" of mankind are illusions transformed from "shame," and what is artificially made into "shame" may also conceal the supreme "glory" of mankind.

Therefore, I oppose the arbitrary slander and insults of the common people towards those they do not understand well.

Therefore, I value riding the wind more than pearls and jade.

As for the many so-called "respectable" or "despicable" aspects of the world, I am absolutely unwilling to follow the crowd before I have gained a deep understanding.

Quiet contemplation is far better than superficial gossiping.

When Buddhist disciples practice, there is a necessary stage called "Seclusion." It means locking one's own stinking body into a narrow room, letting the body endure many disasters; the result of this ascetic practice can promote the liberation of one's own soul.

Without considerable cultivation, one cannot "enter seclusion." If forced against reason, then due to contradictions and even breakdowns in the mind, the practitioner will either be struck down by illness or go mad, even die. This sudden psychological change, in the words of Eliot, is the great opening of the floodgates of consciousness, where the flood engulfs everything.

The use of thought is like walking a road; haste makes waste. Many principles for saving the world and benefiting people are understood through step-by-step, painstaking thought.

Legend has it that Bodhidharma sat facing a wall for ten years. Without selfishness, without self or others; not impatient, not flustered; eliminating infinite delusions, breaking all attachments; sending oneself into the realm of "form and emptiness as one." "Compassion" is the eternal spirit of the Buddha, great compassion, medium compassion, small compassion, no compassion; compassion for heaven and pity for humanity are the most initial and ultimate spirits of all religious figures.

### How to Return a Visit

‚Äî Li Hai

Foreign etiquette dictates: guests must remove their coats and hats upon entering, which some Chinese may find troublesome when first learning this custom. However, as time goes by, "trouble" gradually "progresses" into habit, and habit "elevates" to the point where it is seen as the only way to express politeness and cultivation.

Ordinary guests are expected to remove their coats as a sign of respect upon entering a house, then surely, warriors should even more so remove their arms when visiting someone's "residence". Otherwise, who knows whether you come with good intentions or revenge?

Subsequently, I don't know how it happened ‚Äì may it be due to the continuous improvement of human self-defense ‚Äì this kind of personal etiquette has been rejected and not used in international conventions. Powerful countries simply don't care about armed visits from others; even weak countries, though apprehensive about being invaded, have to pretend to be nonchalant, gritting their teeth and enduring the "visit." This matter seems "equal" on the surface, because they can come, and you can go, a back and forth, which is in line with the way of making friends. However...

Let's talk about the British cruiser HMS Bermuda and the destroyer HMS Encounter, which, with the consent of our government, will sail to Shanghai for a visit tomorrow.

Yes, we are not worried that these two warships will stay in China's territorial waters forever, "like returning to their hometown, never to return." Since they are a famous gentleman's country, we should not doubt that they would do petty things ‚Äì such as a gunner suddenly having a nervous breakdown and firing on Shanghai; or officials bringing some private goods ashore to sell; or sailors, like that "annoying" little Attlee, spreading democratic seeds in China, causing the general public to lament: "Foreign democracy is better than Chinese!" and so on.

In the end, what I am worried about is how to return the visit.

A warrior dressed in armor, carrying a cocked bow and a drawn sword, always causes a shock when "visiting" a weak and powerless family. But do you have the power to reject him? The door of the weak is always open to the strong ‚Äì open or not, it has to be opened. They walk in when it's open, they break in when it's closed. That's how the laws of nature often are. (April 17th)

### The Joke of the "Atomic Pen King"

‚Äî Meng Long

I remember that before the War of Resistance, a writer once said that Chinese compatriots did not understand humor. This was naturally an extreme statement of "generalizing," which aroused some stubborn compatriots to criticize it, believing that he was increasing the prestige of others, as if saying that the Western moon was better than the Chinese moon.

In fact, there is no need to be too extreme. Among Chinese compatriots, there are indeed many who do not understand humor; even those who are not used to the truth are not uncommon and there are practical witnesses. Treating the truth as a joke, this is a terrible symptom.

Recently, the "Atomic Pen King" Baron Bich, flew in on the "Air France" plane, and flew back. Someone asked Bich and his two co-pilots what they would do in the short term. The three answers were simple, clear and interesting. The first person said: "Sleep!" The second person said: "Eat and sleep!" The third person said: "Eat, sleep, and get married!"

Because these three answers are simple, clear, and innocently interesting, some people naively regard them as jokes and "laugh them off." People with this view mostly only know how to eat, sleep, and get married and know nothing else. They don't know that Bich and his group's statements are the most practical truths, because after their feat of staying awake and working for three hundred and thirty nights, and successfully completing the new speed record for circumnavigating the globe, don't they need to eat and sleep to compensate for their past fatigue? As for breaking the flight record first and getting married later, it is also realistic enough, and it is in line with the Chinese spirit of "the wedding night in the bridal chamber and the moment of being named on the gold list," right? I believe that only by unifying the reality of ancient and modern, both Chinese and foreign, can we avoid treating the truth as untruth, or treating the truth as a joke.

### The Fat Club

‚Äî Yun

The newspaper says: the fat people in Jiangxi, have recently initiated the establishment of a "Fat Club", dividing fat people into five levels: super fat, big fat, medium fat, small fat, and almost fat. They widely send out "spleen chains" and widely recruit fat friends, and everyone is having a lot of fun. At the same time, it is said that many of the fat people listed as initiators are celebrities of today.

The so-called fat people must be people with full heads and stomachs, with big bellies, which is due to excessive fat in the body and the ability to be relaxed and happy, which leads to fatness. Of course, a person who has to worry about firewood and rice every day, or even cannot afford to eat red rice and green vegetables, will never get fat.

Therefore, the "Fat Club" can be said to be a wealth group, it is a sneer at the thin and a kind of irony; and one person is fat, ten thousand people are thin, which is an even more heartbreaking fact.

### The Poison of Slave Education

‚Äî Zi Hua

Various Misunderstandings of Taiwanese Compatriots

Taiwan was unfortunately occupied by Japanese imperialism for fifty-one years. During these fifty-one years, in addition to relentlessly exploiting the blood and sweat of Taiwanese compatriots, the Japanese also implemented a kind of education called "Imperialization," trying every possible means to make Taiwanese compatriots forget their motherland, despise their motherland, and become obedient subjects and slaves of their "Emperor." Therefore, today, when Taiwan has returned to the territory of the motherland, there are indeed many Taiwanese compatriots who have not only forgotten the language, writing, and thoughts of the motherland, but also have many distorted understandings of the motherland. The author has traveled to Taiwan for more than a year, and knows quite well about the situation of the distorted thoughts instilled by the Japanese to Taiwanese compatriots, so I will briefly describe one or two to let the people of the country understand the depth of the poison of the slave education implemented by Japan in Taiwan.

A few days after I arrived in Taiwan last year, a Taiwanese compatriot asked me: "Sir, is the highest building in the motherland as big as the Shintai Company?" (Note: The Shintai Company is a department store in Taipei built with a five-story western-style stone building). I couldn't help but laugh when I heard this. Unexpectedly, not long after, another Taiwanese compatriot came to ask me: "Does the motherland also have electric lights like Taipei here?" At this time, I really didn't know how to tell him, so I had to answer him very vaguely, "The motherland has everything that is here, and the motherland has what is not necessarily here!"

The Japanese not only portrayed our customs to Taiwanese compatriots as being extremely crude, but also used extremely insulting tones towards our mainland compatriots to give Taiwanese compatriots a very bad impression. They said that the people of China only eat and do nothing, Chinese students only understand that the earth is round after graduating from high school, Chinese soldiers can't even fire their guns and run away when they are scared by the number of people, Chinese habits are weak, selfish, and impolite‚Ä¶.

Taiwanese compatriots have been so deeply poisoned by the slave education of the Japanese, so the 228 Incident that occurred this time was certainly not accidental. In addition to sympathizing with and understanding them, we should quickly help them with re-education, which is the right way to do it.

### Anecdotes of Wang Tieshan

‚Äî Yun Jian

Wang Hu Tieshan, a former Qing Dynasty scholar, was an honest and sincere gentleman. Even heroes like Yuan Shikai dared not disrespect him. In the early years of the Republic of China, the Shanghai Jianghai Customs planned to burn a large amount of opium confiscated from confiscation in a large kiln specially built in Pudong. Wang Tieshan served as a special commissioner of the Presidential Palace and came to Shanghai to supervise. At that time, the Shanghai Daoyin was Wang Gengting, who asked Tie Lao what preparations he had made? He said, "Since I am responsible for this task, I should clarify the truth in order to report back to Beijing." He asked Daoyin to send a guide, a small boat, and give him an ordinary admission ticket, and he would not need any special treatment. Daoyin knew that this old man was bookish, so he agreed. The next morning, Tie Lao took a servant, boarded the small boat, and crossed the river to enter the venue. He looked around in the crowded crowd. There were official seats, customs supervisors, Daoyin, diplomatic envoys, county magistrates, and consular leaders from various countries, and business leaders sitting among them. In front were hundreds of boxes of opium, sealed tightly. The staff in the venue were very busy. Soon, the boxes were opened, inspected, doused with kerosene, and thrown into the kiln for burning. The spectators whispered to each other, pointing at the tripod. Although the black smoke was billowing, there was no smell of opium, and Tie Lao also became suspicious. The next day, he went to the kiln again, personally scooped up a large bag of smoke ash, and took it back to Beijing to present to the President, pointing out that this was solid evidence of corruption in the burning of opium. Yuan said, "Sir, you have worked hard. I specially asked you to come to Shanghai to supervise, but it was just to show that my Presidential Palace has not been involved in corruption. If you insist on taking this as evidence of corruption, who delivered it? Who can testify? Perhaps someone will falsely accuse you of not getting what you wanted and using this fake ash as a trap. How will you explain yourself to the world? However, I deeply admire you as an honest and sincere gentleman, and you can also explain yourself. Being among heroes and ghosts is not the same thing."

### Talking About the Yellow River Flood Area

‚Äî Qi Lou

Huo Baoshu, the Director-General of the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, declared after inspecting the Yellow River flood area (the area bordering Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu) that the area has become a desert, and the soil is gradually deteriorating. If it is not cultivated and planted as soon as possible, it will be incurable in the future. The so-called incurable means that one day it will become a real desert, and it will not be possible to cultivate it and make it habitable for a while.

Chinese and foreign scholars who study China have said that the Chinese nation has been subjected to cruel natural selection for thousands of years. Our ancestors originally lived north of the Yellow River, where the climate was dry, which was indeed suitable for human survival. Unfortunately, the northern yellow sand is competing with us for land. It is gradually advancing southward, and the turbulent Yellow River often floods, submerging our houses and fields, forcing us to flee south. Although the people in the south have been able to open up a world and create the civilization of Jiangnan for thousands of years, our bodies have been severely damaged due to the hot and humid climate here. This is a serious blow to the superiority of our nation.

The pitiful thing is that this elimination is still going on. Droughts and floods not only make us poorer and sicker, but also make us develop selfish bad habits: because generous people are often eliminated under the suffering of hunger. Some people call the Yellow River the sorrow of China, and it should be said that this is where its correctness lies. The enemies faced by the Chinese nation in the north are certainly not just nature. Since the Zhou Dynasty, various northern ethnic groups have been constantly invading us. However, external disasters are never as cruel as nature, and never as tenacious as nature. Just look at the countless tribes that invaded us in the past. Where are they now? Only the desert and the Yellow River have never been willing to let us go, and are still killing the vitality of our nation today.

There is no weapon to resist these two great enemies, and that is science, which has been shouted loudly by everyone since the introduction of new ideas into China, but everyone still feels empty about it. Other countries also have similar enemies as the Yellow River, but they have all conquered them with science, and not only conquered them, but also utilized them. What about us? Just listen to Huo Baoshu's words: "It will be incurable if it is delayed any longer!"

### Record of a Precarious City

‚Äî Qin Shouou

"Manager Xie! Busy, I bet?" He pulled up a chair and sat opposite the old man, smiling.

"Not busy! Not busy! If you have something to teach, just say it!" Old Zhu had a feeling of respecting ghosts and gods but keeping them at a distance towards Old Zhu, so he had already decided to deal with him in a polite and smooth manner.

Old Zhu didn't get straight to the point, but first turned his head to stare at Jin Aili, who was leaning against the back of his chair.

"Mr. Zhu, do you want to leave too?" Jin Aili also knew that the person who came to see the old man today would have nothing else to do, and she had not forgotten what she and Old Zhu had talked about yesterday.

"I myself don't want to leave yet." Old Zhu shook his head and gave Jin Aili a special look. "Miss Jin, I want to ask you to talk to Manager Xie, can you help Mrs. Hu?" He was afraid that Old Zhu would not understand for a while, so he added, "Help Mrs. Hu Juewen."

"Okay! We are leaving this afternoon...!" Jin Aili said very quickly, but she immediately regretted that she had spoken too quickly. She could clearly see the smiling Manager Xie sitting on the chair winking at herself repeatedly; so she remembered this morning the Defense Command introduced a Mrs. Lu, wanted to take the old man's car. There had been the Commander's word, and Mrs. Li's letter, but Old Zhu had cleverly refused. There was also a deputy manager of XX Bank who had come to talk for a long time, and as a result, Old Zhu had agreed to take him to Liuzhou alone, on the condition that XX Bank would lend Old Zhu 10 million at 3% interest first.

"Mr. Zhu, I'm really sorry," Old Zhu said. "Aili, she doesn't know my difficulties. Heaven and earth are my witness, I, Zhu Xinong, love to help my friends! Especially you, sir? It's just that my jeep is very old and can only seat four or five people at most; there are seven people in my company who have to leave, plus the two of us. Mr. Zhu,"

Old Zhu didn't really hear what he said next, the previous few sentences were enough. Zhu Zhaonian really regretted coming to hit this nail today.

Now, she didn't really have the courage to let Jin Aili speak to Old Zhu on his behalf, and she didn't know what to say. Whether Old Zhu's words were true or false, she couldn't figure it out at all. But she also saw Old Zhu's disappointed expression.
