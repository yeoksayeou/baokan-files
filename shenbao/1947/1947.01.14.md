### President Urges Increased Production to Restore Pre-War Economic Conditions; Reviews the Past Year at Memorial Week

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 13th] The central authorities held a National Father Memorial Week ceremony at 9:00 AM on the 13th. After President Chiang led the ceremony,

(1) The President first pointed out, "The main work of the government last year was in accepting surrender and demobilization. The surrender work was the most arduous and difficult, because at the time of the enemy's surrender, there were more than 1.3 million troops within our borders, and their strength and organization were still intact and had not collapsed. Moreover, when the government's surrender work was underway, it encountered various internal obstacles and contradictory phenomena. If the plan had been slightly careless or the steps slightly imprudent at that time, extremely dangerous consequences would have occurred. However, our government, party, military, and colleagues were able to successfully complete the task amidst complex situations, which is the most important page in last year's work. As for the enemy prisoners of war and enemy expatriates remaining in our country after the enemy army surrendered, the total number reached 3 million. If such a large number of enemy prisoners of war could not be sent or if the repatriation work was delayed and could not be completed, the country's economy and social security would be severely affected, and the consequences would be unimaginable. However, the government also completely repatriated the enemy prisoners of war from within the Pass and Taiwan to Japan before July last year, which was an extremely arduous task. The reason why it was able to be completed quickly within this short period of time was due to the full assistance of our ally, the United States. While the United States government fulfilled its obligations as an ally and did not expect any reward from our country, from our country's point of view—even in terms of ordinary interpersonal relations and due responses—the value of this pure and friendly work exceeded any material assistance and should be forever engraved in the history of our country's demobilization and never forgotten.

(2) Regarding demobilization work, there have been significant and hard-won achievements in the past year. Whether in politics, economy, transportation, education, military affairs, or party affairs, all have done their best to achieve the predetermined goals and lay the foundation for demobilization work. In particular, the demobilization work related to the economy is even more significant, because the closest relations to the economy are transportation, heavy industry, and mining areas.

Hope that compatriots observe the constitution, transportation, mining areas, and industry are restored

Recalling the transportation situation at the beginning of last year, almost all domestic railway trunk lines were destroyed. Today, except for one-tenth of the northern section of the Pinghan Railway, one-half of the northern section of the Jinpu Railway, one-tenth of the eastern section of the Longhai Railway, and the northern section of the Tongpu Railway, other major trunk lines have been gradually repaired and opened to traffic. In particular, the Guangdong-Han, Jiaoji, Beining, Pingsui, Anfeng, and South Manchuria railways—the six major trunk lines—were restored by the tireless efforts of transportation workers day and night amidst extreme hardships, which is even more encouraging. Secondly, for important industrial and mining areas, the recovery of important industrial areas across the country has reached more than 80%. All the most important mining areas, such as Jiaozuo, Liuhegou, Boshan, Linzao, Longyan, and Datong within the Pass, and Anshan, Fushun, Benxi, Tieling, Beipiao, and Fuxin in the Northeast, have been completely recovered. In addition, in Taiwan, nine out of ten heavy industries have resumed work. What is particularly noteworthy is that all areas where salt and cotton are produced, which are important raw materials for industry, have been completely recovered by the government as of now. As long as our government and people continue to work hard this year, production will increase and imports will decrease. There is no doubt that the first step in economic recovery will be to reach the pre-war level.

(3) Regarding the political aspect, among the local governments of various provinces, except for Hebei, Shanxi, and Shandong, where two-thirds or one-half of the counties have not yet been recovered, and the five provinces of North Manchuria, all other provinces, such as Jiangsu, where only Ganyu County north of the Longhai Railway remains, and Henan, where only Linxian and Shexian in northern Henan have not been recovered, all more than 1,800 counties across the country have been restored. In the future, it is only necessary to make efforts to rectify and actively promote production work. The formulation of the Constitution by the National Assembly on December 25 last year and the establishment of a democratic foundation are major events that mark an era in our country's history and a great success of the leadership of the national revolution by our party comrades for the past 50 years. It can be gratifying to the soul of the Premier and the martyrs in heaven. If all our compatriots and the government can follow the procedures resolved by the National Assembly, earnestly implement them, and jointly abide by the Constitution, the country will surely enter a long period of peace and stability, and the realization of the Three People's Principles will be self-evident.

### Comment on Marshall's Statement: Frank, Selfless, and Constructive; We Should Accept It in Good Faith

(4) Finally, the President mentioned General Marshall's statement, stating: "Since President Truman of the United States issued a policy statement on China at the end of last year, General Marshall, upon his return to the country this time, has made a supplementary statement on the political situation in our country. People from all walks of life have asked me for my opinion on this, and due to different viewpoints, many misunderstandings have arisen. I believe that General Marshall's statement and President Truman's statement must be read and compared at the same time in order to get a glimpse of their entire spirit. That is to say, the judgment of right and wrong cannot be said to be unfair. If only General Marshall's statement is read and President Truman's statement is forgotten, it is inevitable that distortions and misunderstandings will occur. Comrades, you should pay attention to the first paragraph of General Marshall's statement, which clearly informs the reader that this statement is a 'supplement to President Truman's statement.' I cannot say that I completely agree with General Marshall's views, but considering General Marshall's mission and his own position in making this report to the American people, it can be said that he is frank, selfless, sincere, and friendly, and that it is an important and constructive statement. As for General Marshall's statement and all the criticisms of our party and government, I have always believed in his mission and his spirit of traditional friendship with China. In the past year, he has painstakingly assisted China in peaceful unification and single-mindedly hoped that China would become a strong and democratic country, so we should pay special attention to this point. I believe that we revolutionary parties should accept any well-intentioned criticism, regardless of the angle of observation, in good faith. As the saying goes, 'If there is something wrong, correct it; if there is nothing wrong, be more diligent.' We should also adopt this attitude towards General Marshall's statement so that it can benefit the country and the party. (End)

### The General Budget for this Year is Approved by the National Defense Council with Amendments

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 13th] The National General Budget for the 36th year has been approved by the Provisional Meeting of the Supreme National Defense Council on the morning of the 13th. The meeting was held at the National Government after the Central Memorial Week, and President Chiang presided over it personally. During the meeting, based on the reports submitted by the National Defense Council's General Budget Review Committee and the Standing Committee of the Political Consultative Conference, the General Budget was reviewed, and after making amendments to certain items, the entire proposal was approved.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 13th] The National General Budget for the 36th year was passed with amendments after two hours of discussion at today's provisional meeting of the Supreme National Defense Council, and it was decided to submit it to the National Government for implementation while submitting it to the Legislative Yuan to complete the legislative procedures. The National General Budget for the Year has now been finalized. The total budget remains at the original proposal of over 930 billion, with no increases or decreases.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 13th] According to a report submitted by the Ministry of Finance to the Executive Yuan, the procedure for reviewing and compiling the General Budget for the 36th year has not yet been completed, and it is estimated that it will take a considerable amount of time for approval. In order to prepare for the appropriation procedures of the national treasury as soon as possible to avoid affecting the implementation of government affairs, the Executive Yuan, following the precedents of previous years, has formulated six measures for the preparation and allocation of various expenses before the General Budget for the 36th year is approved and implemented, which were approved by the Supreme National Defense Council. The six measures are as follows:

(1) Military expenses will be allocated one month in advance according to the original approved budget for the 35th year, the supplementary budget, and the continuing nature of emergency order allocations, and one month's allocation will be made before December 5.

(2) The general recurring expenses of central agencies will be allocated one month in advance to agencies that apply for direct allocation of funds, according to the average of one-twelfth of the original approved budget for the 35th year and the continuing nature of supplementary cases. However, in remote areas where the monthly expenses are not large, three months' allocation may be made in advance. Agencies that apply for allocation funds will be allocated three months at a time, and the expenses of food and grain agencies will be handled separately.

(3) Living subsidies for central agencies will be pre-allocated according to the amount allocated in December of this year (including previous adjustments) for each unit listed in the annex to the general budget for the 35th year. All agencies applying for direct allocation or transfer allocation will have the same pre-allocation months and pre-allocation funds.

(4) Business expenses are different in nature from ordinary expenses and should still be allocated monthly according to the distribution amount after the General Budget for the 36th year is approved.

(5) Subsidies for provinces and cities will be pre-allocated for three months according to the average monthly distribution amount of the second half of the 35th year. The Executive Yuan will list them and notify the Ministry of Finance for allocation, which will still be deducted after the total amount of subsidies for each province and city is approved.

(6) If any unit allocated for pre-allocated expenses is deleted and not listed in the General Budget for the 36th year, the pre-allocated expenses will be deducted from the settlement severance pay to be received by each agency according to regulations. However, agencies that were ordered to be abolished in the 35th year will not be issued any fees.

### Communist Forces in Northern Jiangsu are Vigorously Advancing Southward; Fierce Fighting is Underway in Suqian; Wang Maogong Says Security in Northern Jiangsu is Very Good

[This Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 13th] Huaiyin Telegram: (1) Order in Shuyang has gradually recovered, but the Communist forces in eastern Yun are vigorously advancing southward. On the morning of the 13th, the National Army launched two counterattacks, one to block Miaotou Yinping, and the other to counterattack Yanjie.

### Sun Ke and Others Arrive in Nanjing from Shanghai; Jointly Visit the President to Report on the Negotiations; Discuss Peace Talk Methods in Nanjing Today

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 13th] Sun Ke, Zhang Qun, and Lei Zhen returned to Nanjing by car at 9:30 AM on the 13th. According to Lei Zhen at the station, their trip to Shanghai was to exchange opinions with various parties. It has now been decided to first resume peace talks and then reorganize the government. As for the form and content of the peace talks, it will be decided after consulting President Chiang and exchanging opinions with government officials. It has not yet been decided whether to adopt a round table approach or direct negotiations between the two parties. Lei said that the government may contact the CCP about this matter recently, and if necessary, will send personnel to Yan'an to seek the CCP's opinions. When exchanging opinions in Shanghai, the Democratic Socialist Party and the Youth Party agreed to come to Nanjing to participate when the round table conference is held. Reports that the Democratic Socialist Party had submitted a plan to the government are not true. The Democratic Socialist Party had originally planned to hold a joint meeting with the Youth Party, but it was not held due to various reasons, and the plan was not submitted either.

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 13th] Zhang Qun told reporters at the station on the morning of the 13th that there is still much hope for the future of peace talks because the future of China must be resolved peacefully. He himself is willing to work hard for peace, but if the Communist Party insists on the two points it previously raised, negotiations will still be quite difficult. Zhang did not affirm or deny whether he would go to Yan'an, only saying that everything would depend on the needs of the situation. He also said that he had originally planned to return to Sichuan for a trip before the New Year in the Gregorian calendar, but now he is afraid that he will have to stay in Nanjing for a considerable period of time. Zhang looked slightly haggard after his serious illness, but his spirits were still good.

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 13th] Sun Ke told reporters at the station on the morning of the 13th that government officials would discuss the issue of peace talks after the three dignitaries returned to Nanjing. When reporters asked about the reactions from various parties after the suggestion to convene a round table conference was put forward and what progress had been made recently, Sun was unwilling to express his opinion.

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 13th] After Sun Ke and others returned to Nanjing, the political atmosphere in the capital became active again. On the afternoon of the 13th, Xiong Shihui, Zhang Zhizhong, Lei Zhen, and others gathered at Sun's residence. Not long after, Shao Lizi, Wang Shijie, and others also rushed to the scene. It is reported that the dignitaries had important discussions on the specific plan for peace talks.

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 13th] Sun Ke, Zhang Qun, Lei Zhen, and the three dignitaries visited the President at 7:00 PM on the 13th and had dinner. Shao Lizi, Zhang Lisheng, Chen Lifu, Wang Chonghui, Wang Shijie, Wu Dingchang, and six others accompanied them. During the dinner, the three reported on the results of their consultations with various parties in Shanghai and the results of the afternoon meeting. The President inquired in detail about the opinions of various parties in Shanghai.

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 13th] Regarding the reopening of peace talks, in addition to planning to send personnel to Yan'an, the government also intends to invite Communist Party members from Yan'an to come to Nanjing.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 13th] Regarding the plan and method for resuming peace talks, government officials are scheduled to hold a meeting at President Sun's residence on the afternoon of the 14th, and it is rumored that a decision will be made between convening a round table conference and sending personnel to Yan'an. According to government officials, the government is determined to adopt a political solution, and hopes to resume peace talks so that various issues can be resolved peacefully.

### Zhang Junmai Talks in Shanghai; Approves the Convening of a Round Table Conference

[Central News Agency, Shanghai] Zhang Junmai, leader of the Democratic Socialist Party, said yesterday that he strongly approves of the round table conference proposal put forward by President Sun and earnestly hopes that the government will complete preparations for resuming peace talks as soon as possible. He firmly believes that neither party should put forward any preconditions for resuming peace talks and that all issues must be discussed and decided at the party conference. According to Sun Baoyi, a spokesperson for the Democratic Socialist Party, the party advocates resolving the current situation in three steps: first, resume peace talks; second, reform politics; and third, reorganize the government. However, if peace talks are resumed but peace is hopeless, the Democratic Socialist Party will resolutely participate in the government. Because peace talks are mainly a matter for the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, other important issues cannot be allowed to be put on hold for a long time because of their failure. Since the Democratic Socialist Party has participated in the constitution-making process, it is its unavoidable duty to participate in the government in accordance with the constitution.

Among the rescued passengers, someone witnessed Ms. Li Suzhen selflessly returning to the sinking plane to rescue the injured Luo Chifeng, and ultimately died by drowning.

Two Dancers From the Metropolis

It is reported that Ms. Li Suzhen is Feng Ying in the passenger list. She and Ms. Zhou Lijuan (i.e. Zhou Ping), Luo Chifeng, Li Chengyu, and Mr. Sun Zhiqing all have the same address: Room 653, Hamilton Building, Jiangxi Road.

According to pilot Wallace and co-pilot Lamar, the No. 2 engine of the plane caught fire at 1:50 PM on the 11th and crashed into the sea. The damaged wing caught fire, and if it had not been landed on the sea in time, no one on the plane would have survived.

The three English schoolchildren on board, the Bradock brothers and Spangen, were all safe and in good spirits. They were going to study in Australia.

Another Englishman, Henderson, an employee of the Asiatic Petroleum Company, said after being rescued: "We are indeed lucky. The jokes of the Bradock brothers and Spangen made us feel happy."

The Merits of the Co-pilot

Co-pilot Lamar said: "I was fortunate to avoid danger before the wing was destroyed. This experience has made me a believer in fate." He also told the crew of the General Collins: "I would very much like to return on this ship because my wife is in Auckland and she is very anxious." Lamar was the one who piloted the plane to make a forced landing on the sea. Pilot Wallace said that if Lamar had not landed successfully, everyone on the plane would have been smashed to pieces.

### Remarks of the Huang River Consulting Group on their Inspection: Preventing Disasters on the Yellow River is More Important Than Developing its Resources; Disasters Should Cease After the Implementation of the Plan

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 13th] The Ministry of Publicity held a press conference with Chinese and foreign reporters at 3 PM today. Minister Peng Xuepei specially invited Shen Yi, Chairman of the Public Works Commission of the Supreme Economic Council, and American engineering and water conservancy experts from the Yellow River Consulting Group to give reports (Shen's report is below). Lieutenant General Reybold, Chief of Engineers of the US Army, hailed as the "Marshall of the American Engineering World," reported as the spokesperson of the Yellow River Consulting Group: He recalled that when the Mississippi River in the United States was flooded in 1937, there was also a press conference, but only 54 reporters attended, which was less than half of today's attendees.

The Yellow River contains too much sediment, and the riverbed is higher than the ground. Its complexity and severity are unmatched by other harmful rivers in the world. During the inspection tour, General Zhao Shouyu, Chairman of the Yellow River Conservancy Commission, said, "Currently, the work on the Yellow River emphasizes preventing disasters rather than developing resources." The group shares the same sentiment. The Yellow River flows into the North China Plain from Mengjin. For many years, the work on the Yellow River has been limited to building dikes for prevention, and has not yet been developed. We believe that if the upstream and downstream plans are implemented, the Yellow River should no longer be a disaster. The thorough implementation of this plan requires the joint efforts of everyone present and the people of the whole country. Dr. Shen mentioned earlier that soil and water conservation, reducing soil and storing water, etc., will take a considerable number of years to complete, because the Yellow River still contains a considerable amount of sediment.

The current important work should be to fully renovate and strengthen the existing dikes, and at the same time build a flood detention dam between Mengjin and Xia County. The downstream of the reservoir also needs to strengthen the dikes and build dams or reservoirs. As for power generation and irrigation, it is not yet the time to talk about them.

After nearly a month of inspection, a preliminary report will be drafted in the next few days, and a detailed Yellow River management plan will be prepared. If it can be successfully implemented, it is believed that the fundamental goal of management can be achieved. Finally, I hope that everyone will publicize the planting of grass along the Yellow River.

According to Shen Yi, Mr. Savage will leave China for India on the 20th, and Mr. Reybold will also return to the United States before the end of the month. The group's preliminary report can be submitted within five or six days.

Shen Yi Analyzes the Sources of the Yellow River's Problems and Explains Three Treatment Plans

Data on the Yellow River

Shen Yi reported: The Yellow River Consulting Group was formed at the end of last year by three American experts: Lieutenant General Reybold, Chief of Engineers of the US Army; Dr. Savage, consultant of the US Reclamation Bureau and host of the Yangtze River Hydropower Project; Mr. Growdon, Chief Engineer of the American Engineering Company; and Secretary A. Ussery. In order to facilitate the research of the three experts and give full play to their effectiveness, the Public Works Commission of the Supreme Economic Council first engaged in preparatory work from July to November last year. It invited meteorology, geology, engineering, economics, and other agencies and experts to collect relevant data, sort them out, and compile complete and systematic documents, so that American experts could thoroughly understand the situation of the Yellow River. The collected data can be divided into "organizing basic reference data" and "organizing various Yellow River management plans." The basic reference data includes the general situation of the Yellow River, the geology and soil of the Yellow River basin, meteorology and hydrology, soil and water conservation, economic conditions, the management of the downstream river channel, the map and photos of the Yellow River basin, a total of 620,000 words translated from Japanese to Chinese, 1,360,000 words translated into English, 325 charts and graphs, 1,236 maps, and 51 photos.

Sources of the Problem and Solutions

Shen then analyzed the sources of the Yellow River's problems and the solutions: The source of the Yellow River's problem lies in the large amount of loess it contains, which is deposited and elevated, and the water does not flow underground. Therefore, it is extremely easy to overflow and change its course. From the Great Yu era in 2287 BC to 1937, the course changed six times, with about 1,580 breaches, almost averaging one breach every two years. There are three treatment plans: (1) use water to attack sand, so that the riverbed and water surface deepen underground; (2) plant trees and grass in the loess areas of Shanxi, Shaanxi, Gansu, and Ningxia provinces in the middle and upper reaches, build sand barriers, prevent loess from being washed into the Yellow River, and turn the Yellow River into clear water; (3) build dams in the river valleys of the middle and upper reaches and their tributaries to regulate the water volume, so that there are no floods in the downstream, no breaches, and water can be diverted for irrigation, increasing agricultural production and generating huge amounts of electricity, and developing industry in North China. The Yellow River management plan is designed to cooperate with the above three programs to achieve the greatest effect. We will ask the three experts to determine the degree of cooperation of these three programs, distinguish the priority of implementation, and solve the major difficulties in general technology. If the Yellow River management plan can be gradually completed, it can turn harm into benefit. Let's try to describe its vision as follows:

A Beautiful Vision

In the western part of Shanxi, the eastern part of Shaanxi and Gansu, and other major loess areas, implement erosion control projects, plant trees on the mountains, plant grass on the ground, and build sand dams in the valleys to prevent the fertile topsoil from being washed away and increase agricultural production. Build several dams on the Yellow River's middle and upper reaches and their tributaries to prevent floods, irrigate, and generate electricity. Build dams in the Weihe River Valley to prevent floods, irrigate the Guanzhong Plain, and generate electricity for the Guanzhong area of Shaanxi. Build dams in the Sanmenxia area to prevent floods, generate electricity for the Jin, Yu, and E provinces, and regulate the low water flow to facilitate downstream navigation.

After the completion of any of the above major reservoirs, there will be no more floods in the downstream. We can fully renovate the waterways, allow steamboats to navigate, and set up silt discharge projects in accordance with the constitution to improve the land. At present, the land on both sides of the Yellow River is lower than the riverbed, and most of it is saline-alkali land and sandy soil. Use the soil contained in the Yellow River water to create fertile fields and greatly increase agricultural production. We hope to implement this entire construction plan in the Yellow River basin, so that the Yellow River, the birthplace of our ancestors, which has been plagued by disasters for thousands of years, will become the richest resource in China.

### Refugees in the Yellow River Flooded Area Denounce the Chinese Communists for Obstructing the Closing of the Breach

[Central News Agency, Kaifeng, 12th] The Refugee Representative Congress in the Yellow River flooded area recently sent telegrams to relevant agencies denouncing the Chinese Communists' telegram to obstruct the closing of the breach, and describing the suffering of the refugees in the flooded area for the past eight years, stating: Recent reports say that the Yellow River breach closing project is progressing smoothly, and the post-flood reconstruction conference in the flooded area is also being held. When the refugees in the flooded area were burning incense to celebrate, they suddenly heard that the Chinese Communists were making unreasonable protests, attempting to obstruct the breach closing project. They were shocked by the news. The Chinese Communists often claim to be a party representing the people, but now they are acting perversely, disregarding the millions of victims in more than 20 counties, and obstructing them. What are their intentions and how cruel are they? They also refuted the Chinese Communists' reasons for opposing the closing of the breach.

### Site of the Northwest Hydropower Generation Office Determined: Tianshui

[Central News Agency, Lanzhou, 13th] The National Hydropower Generation Engineering Office has recently decided to establish a Northwest Branch in order to survey the entire hydropower generation site in the Northwest. The office will be located in Tianshui.

### "Wolf of Jinan": Masao Tanaka Executed

[Our Newspaper, Jinan, 13th] Masao Tanaka, the host of the Japanese Gendarmerie Fengfeng Mansion, known as the "Wolf of Jinan," was executed by firing squad at the foot of Sili Mountain in the south of the city at 7:30 this morning by the local War Crimes Military Tribunal. This is the third war criminal to be executed in Jinan City.

### Han Traitor Ma Ziyuan from Harbin Reportedly Hiding in Shanghai

[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 13th] According to people from Harbin: Ma Ziyuan, a Han traitor from Harbin, became a Japanese citizen during the enemy puppet era, changed his name to Kisaburo Hiyama, and opened the Asia Alcohol Company. Because Ma was proficient in Japanese, he was introduced to Yoshijiro Umezu, Commander of the Kwantung Army, by Motomi Yanagida, the head of the Harbin Special Affairs Agency. He had a close relationship with him and supplied alcohol for the Japanese army. He also relied on the power of the enemy to harm countless compatriots. After the restoration, Ma used all his property to move around. It is now known that he is hiding in Shanghai. The people of Northeast China are paying close attention to Ma.

### Overseas Chinese in Hanoi Trapped in the City: More Than 10,000 People Have No Food to Eat; Overseas Chinese Representatives Present Three Suggestions to the Government

[Our Newspaper] The recent military conflicts between France and Vietnam in various parts of northern Vietnam have affected overseas Chinese, resulting in heavy losses (loss figures have been published in our newspaper on the 11th). Currently, the war is still continuing in the Hanoi area, where overseas Chinese are concentrated. Although the overseas Chinese area is listed as a neutral zone, it is gradually isolated from the outside world due to the French army's encirclement, resulting in serious food problems in the overseas Chinese area. There are currently more than 10,000 overseas Chinese trapped in the area. Recently, due to the exhaustion of rice and grain, they are facing starvation. Some overseas Chinese can only eat mung bean flour and miscellaneous grains to fill their stomachs. At the same time, the damage to the tap water in the area has caused serious health consequences, leading to the spread of diseases. Due to the lack of medicine, there are many people who die from disease rather than from artillery fire.

The overseas Chinese believe that the situation is becoming more and more serious. Therefore, last month, they sent Yang Jianzhong and Yan Renfu as representatives to return to China and visit the relevant authorities in Beijing, including the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Overseas Affairs, the Ministry of National Defense, the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, and the Central Party Headquarters, requesting urgent measures and assistance. In addition to negotiating with France and Vietnam to compensate for all the losses suffered by the overseas Chinese, they also quickly organized post-disaster relief. At the same time, they also put forward three suggestions, urging them to be realized as soon as possible: (1) Please allocate funds for relief. (According to the Executive Yuan, the Central Bank has been ordered to allocate 2 million Vietnamese currency to handle emergency relief.) (2) Please send planes to Hue, Da Nang, Hanoi, and Haiphong to contact the local consulates. It is also requested to restore the China-Vietnam航line, and transport 5 tons of rice and grain from Kunming and Nanning every day to relieve the starving people trapped in Hanoi. When returning, try to rescue the overseas Chinese from danger. (3) Please send high-ranking officials from the central government to organize an investigation team to investigate the number of casualties of overseas Chinese and all the losses in various areas of Vietnam, so as to make detailed statistics, and the government will negotiate compensation with both sides of Vietnam.

Minister Peng's Wonderful Analogy: The Confluence of the Yellow River, the Yangtze River, and the Huai River is Like a Love Triangle Between Men and Women

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 13th] At the press conference, Minister Peng used the joys and sorrows of men and women to compare the repeated changes in the course of the Yellow River. According to him: For thousands of years, the Yangtze River, the Huai River, and the Yellow River have had four separations and unions. Five years ago, Jin Tongzong Mingchang found a way out for each of the three rivers, without involving each other. Five years after Mingchang, the Yellow River and the Huai River got married. In the fifth year of Xianfeng, Zhunshui divorced the Yellow River and remarried the Yangtze River. After 1938, the three rivers converged, forming a love triangle, and the situation became serious. He also said: The Yellow River problem is related to the lives and property of tens of millions of people and should be solved. Shen Yi also said: Since the confluence of the Jiang, Huai, and He rivers, the three major rivers in central China have all used Shanghai as their outlet to the sea, forming a mess. The situation is very serious.

### Our Consul General in Hanoi Risks Crossing the Fire Line to Discuss Bridge Protection Methods with the Vietnamese Side

[Reuters, Hanoi, 12th] Yuan Zijian, the Chinese Consul General in Hanoi, today held the Chinese flag in one hand and the white flag in the other, and crossed the no-man's land between the French and Vietnamese fronts in Hanoi for the eighth time to consult with the Minh authorities on methods to protect the lives and property of 10,000 overseas Chinese. Although the French and Vietnamese armies have formally promised to stop shooting when Mr. Yuan passes through, stray bullets are common, so Mr. Yuan faces a real life-threatening danger every time he passes through the no-man's land. Mr. Yuan, together with the British Consul General Mr. Skeate and the American Consul General Mr. Sullivan, has already contacted the arrogant officials of the Minh government, but the Vietnamese army in the fortress area still refuses to accept the proposal of a neutral zone, believing that the overseas Chinese or Indians in the area should withdraw to the Minh-controlled area in the north of Hanoi or the French-controlled area in the south of Hanoi before the final battle begins. (See the Fourth Factory for news about the French-Vietnamese war)

### Conflicts Between Indians and Dutch in Palembang: Overseas Chinese Suffer Innocently Again; Hundreds Killed, Kidnapped, or Missing

[Central News Agency, Singapore, 13th] The overseas Chinese in Palembang have suffered again due to the conflict between the Netherlands and Indonesia. This was reported by Zeng Shi and Shen Zhuhui, two representatives who attended yesterday's meeting of the Singapore and Palembang Overseas Chinese Relief Fund Committee. According to their preliminary estimates, hundreds of overseas Chinese have been killed, kidnapped, or are missing, and thousands have been displaced. More than 100 houses and shops have been burned, and the total loss is about 10 million Singapore dollars. Mr. Chen, our consul in Palembang, also attended yesterday's meeting. He had just finished his tour of southeastern Sumatra and returned here recently. The incident occurred at 3 PM on New Year's Day and a truce was not announced until the afternoon of January 5. When the war broke out, Mr. Chen was out on official business, and Vice Consul Li Dingyuan acted on his behalf. During the war, Mr. Li risked stray bullets to go to the Dutch authorities to explain the losses of the overseas Chinese, but the Dutch authorities denied their responsibility, and their promise to help the overseas Chinese was never fulfilled. The meeting decided to telegraph the government for assistance and submit formal reports on the entire situation to Wu Bosheng, our Consul General in Singapore, and Jiang Jiadong, Consul General in Batavia.

### Siam Submits Memorandum to Us

[Reuters, Bangkok, 12th] Siamese Foreign Minister Charnan revealed today that Siam has prepared a detailed report on the activities of some overseas Chinese in Bangkok due to the continued disputes between overseas Chinese and Siamese people, and the Siamese ambassador to China will submit it to the Chinese government today. Mr. Charnan said that these incidents have gone beyond the scope of law and order, so he hopes that the Chinese government can understand the actual situation.

[Reuters, Bangkok, 12th] According to the Chinese side here: Since the Japanese surrender, there have been frequent conflicts between overseas Chinese and border soldiers. The reason is that the overseas Chinese only hung the Chinese flag but were unwilling to hang the Siamese flag at the same time when celebrating the Allied victory. Up to now, 25 overseas Chinese have been killed and 132 injured in the conflicts. The relationship between overseas Chinese and Siamese people is still very tense. Conflicts between overseas Chinese and Siamese tram ticket sellers occurred again last month and last Thursday, and the police intervened.

### Tianjin Newspapers Sign Contract with Soviet Union to Order 5,000 Tons of Newsprint

[United Press, Tianjin, 13th] Tianjin newspapers are in short supply of newsprint, and the sources from Canada and the United States are also limited. In order to remedy this, the newspapers have successively ordered from the Soviet Union. A contract has now been signed with the Soviet trade representative to order 5,000 tons, which will be shipped from Vladivostok within two months.

### Korea Exchanges 4,000 Tons of Sand for 1 Ton of Our Salt

[Our Newspaper, Tianjin, 13th] The principle of importing 460,000 tons of Changlu salt from our country by Korea in 1946 has been decided, but the authorities shelved it because there is no formal trade agreement between China and Korea. Recently, at the request of the Allied forces stationed in Korea, it has been decided to allow Korea to exchange sand for salt. The first batch of exchange will be 4,000 tons of sand for 1,000 tons of salt, which will be handled by the China Trust Bureau. After the sand arrives, it will be fully allocated to the Yaohua Glass Company for application.

### Opening of the Executive Yuan's Work Relief Conference: Huo Shishu Reports on the Achievements of Relief and Construction Work; Representatives of Various Branches Describe the Difficulties Encountered

[Our Newspaper] The national Executive Yuan's Work Relief Conference was held yesterday morning at the auditorium of the Licha Hotel. Those present were Huo Baoshu, Director of the Office; Li Zhuomin, Deputy Director; Lu Guangmian, Director of the Relief Department; A. Ogden, Director of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration; representatives of various branches and offices; and representatives of the National Resources Commission, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, and the Sino-American Joint Commission on Rural Reconstruction, a total of more than 80 people.

Director Huo first delivered a speech, reviewing the achievements of the Executive Yuan's relief work and construction work in the past year. It is estimated that 220,000 tons of public grain were directly distributed for relief, rescuing more than 10 million refugees. In the work-for-relief part, various constructions employed 1.5 million workers, and 160,000 tons of public grain were distributed. In the social welfare part, 4 million people benefited, and 84,000 tons of public grain were distributed. 8 million mu of farmland benefited from water conservancy work. In the public health work, 1,600 hospitals were rebuilt, with a total expenditure of 8 billion yuan. 1.12 million refugees were sent back, with a total expenditure of 20 billion yuan. Mr. Huo pointed out that future work will focus more on work-for-relief, so that relief can be combined with construction. The Executive Yuan has drawn up no less than 100 work-for-relief plans, with varying scopes. The future policy should be to design a more complete work system and earnestly complete the established plan. The focus is on managing the Yellow River flooded area and building the Gan-Yue and Han-Liang roads.

Then Deputy Director Li, UNRRA Director Ogden, Zhang Aizhen from the Guest Women's Guidance Association, and Chen Shaowen from the Sino-American Joint Commission on Rural Reconstruction delivered speeches one after another, unanimously praising the work-for-relief method, and hoping that the conference would have a successful result.

From 11 AM in the morning and throughout the afternoon, representatives of various branches reported on the work situation and the difficulties encountered. In summary, the work-for-relief work done by the branches across the country mainly includes: (1) farmland water conservancy, (2) transportation roads, (3) house construction, (4) school reconstruction, (5) hospital hygiene, and other major projects. As for the general difficulties encountered, they include (1) inconvenient transportation and expensive freight, such as in Guangdong and Jiangxi provinces, the freight for each ton of public grain is often more than 100,000 yuan; (2) the quality of public grain varies, the inferior ones are inedible, and the supply from the General Office is often irregular; (3) insufficient funds, which has a great impact on the progress of work; (4) although the local governments can generally cooperate, they often suffer from lack of power due to their own lack of financial resources. All of these are the major difficulties. The representatives sincerely stated that they hoped that this conference would get reasonable improvement.

Today's conference will feature briefings and instructions from various offices and departments in the morning, and a general review of work-for-relief policies in the afternoon.

### Education on Preventing Death and Injury

— Zhou Shang

"A gentleman does not stand beneath a dangerous wall," which expresses the "safety first" principle advocated by Westerners. Confucius taught us, "When ascending a carriage, one must stand upright and hold the reins. In the carriage, do not speak of private desires, do not turn your head quickly, and do not point with familiarity." Ji Jie, Zhou said, "Standing upright and holding the reins are for safety." The reins are the ropes used to pull oneself into the carriage. One must carefully hold the ropes when getting into the carriage to avoid the danger of falling. Once in the carriage, do not express private desires, do not speak hastily, and do not point with familiarity. This is to teach us not to turn our heads back, look around, talk too much, or gesture wildly, lest the driver be distracted and cause an accident. These are all modern safety education, educating humans to prevent accidental death and injury.

Life is inherently a great adventure, constantly seeking new experiences, which give life its meaning. As the machine age entered the atomic age, the adventurousness of life has increased, and thus the danger of life has reached its peak. December 25, 1946, was the foreign Christmas and the Chinese National Renaissance Day. On that day, three passenger planes of the China Central Aviation Companies crashed one after another in Shanghai. By the 28th, 70 people had died and 16 were injured. Loud wailing filled the funeral homes. It was truly, as the Shanghai English-language "Da Mei Evening News" editorial on the 27th called it, "an unprecedented tragedy in the history of civil aviation." This clearly represents the failure of life's adventure, the expansion of danger.

Now, let's examine some data to demonstrate the dreadfulness of neglecting safety. According to a 1936 report by the American Safety Association, the national accidental death statistics for 1934 were:

1. Automobiles...36,000 people
2. Falls...24,000 people
3. Burns...16,000 people
4. Poisoning, gas, firearms...6,800 people
5. Trains...5,000 people

Analyzing the injuries of 1935 in terms of time and economics yields the following results:

In 1936, accidental deaths in the United States neared 111,000, with over 10,000,000 people injured and disabled, resulting in economic losses of $3,750,000,000. Among these, 18,000 deaths and 1,530,000 injuries occurred in industry, with economic losses nearing $660,000,000.

From 1922 to 1936, the number of people run over and killed by cars in the United States increased by 151%. In industry, due to the implementation of safety activities, accident rates steadily decreased by 43% to 61%. The more advanced the culture, the more unsafe opportunities there are. Industry uses machines, manufacturing uses chemicals, vehicles are equipped with motors, and recently, air transportation has been invented. In the past decade, accidental injuries have increased by over 80% per 100,000 population. For automobiles alone, deaths increased by over 1,000 per 100,000 population. During World War I, the United States lost 300,000 soldiers, while 325,000 died under the wheels of cars. On average, one in 21 men died, and one in 86 women died, one person dying every 18 minutes! Due to the development of automobiles in the United States, there is an average of one car for every four people, and wide highways can accommodate eight cars driving abreast. No wonder the accident statistics are alarming. The safety level of airplanes ten years ago was half that of cars, one-fifth that of buses, and one-hundredth that of trains. Of course, they are much safer now, but there are no data to report.

The number of child fatalities often exceeds the total number of common infectious diseases. In 1934, the total number of accidental deaths in American cities was 95,000, with children accounting for a quarter. Accidental death rates for all age groups are higher than other disease mortality rates, except for ages 1-5 and 25-34, with the following statistics:

1. 5-9 years old...40%
2. 10-14 years old...21%
3. 15-19 years old...50%
4. 20-24 years old...69%
5. 35-44 years old...70%

For infants under four years old, pneumonia is the leading cause of death. For young people aged 25-34, tuberculosis is the most common cause of death, but accidents are the second most common cause of death for this group. Overall, while colds and bronchitis are the leading causes of death due to illness, followed by influenza, accidental injuries rank third.

China's population census is not yet clear, education is not yet widespread, and life statistics are not yet available. For now, we will rely on the number of deaths and injuries from automobile accidents alone in Shanghai in October 1946 and Nanjing from November 1st to 22nd to make a rough estimate, which is better than nothing. Shanghai reported 48 deaths/injuries and Nanjing 26. With a combined population of 5 million in these two cities, there were 74 deaths/injuries in 52 days, averaging 1.4 deaths per day, nearly one and a half people. For the entire country with a population of 470 million, the daily deaths/injuries would reach 131.6, about 131 and a half people, totaling 48,034 deaths/injuries per year. This number is certainly not accurate, because the time period is short and the region is limited to two places, but it has alarming and cautionary value. As for casualties other than from automobiles, that is impossible to calculate. It is conceivable that this number would be frightening. Looking at the ten aircraft incidents, from General Dai Li's plane on March 17, 1946, to the recent three planes, resulting in 207 deaths/injuries, is enough to prove this in just nine short months.

Our civilization is certainly not yet up to par, industry is nascent, automobiles are scarce, aviation is backward, railroads are few, cities are underdeveloped, and the application of machinery and chemicals is pitifully limited. In theory, accidental injuries and deaths should be few, but due to human negligence, inadequate equipment, insufficient knowledge, outdated tools, selfishness, superstition, disobedience, violation of regulations, taking pride in not obeying the law, coupled with a lack of caution, accidents often result in collective deaths and injuries. Tragedies of dozens or hundreds of people perishing together occur frequently: shipwrecks, train derailments, car rollovers, chemical explosions, major fires, building collapses—deaths are innumerable. We have 6 million patients who die unjustly each year. This reporter believes that our annual accidental deaths and injuries amount to at least the population of two Shanghai cities. In the recent plane crashes, whether due to foggy weather, pilots disobeying orders, passengers lacking parachutes, the plane's radio or other equipment being damaged, the airport lacking blind landing equipment, company staff being careless, or the number of airports being insufficient, all ultimately boil down to the immediate retribution of not prioritizing safety.

To achieve safety, everyone should have safety knowledge, skills, and attitudes. At the very least, everyone should have "safety awareness." Therefore, we must do our best to promote safety education, educating people to prevent accidental injuries and deaths. The most effective opportunity to implement safety education is when danger occurs. This is the "strike while the iron is hot" teaching method, as well as a practical demonstration teaching method. In this recent plane crash, so many people died and were so severely injured. For this disastrous and tragic event, the classroom experience of many schools is as indifferent as looking at the moon from Earth, still teaching the traditions of reading, writing, and arithmetic passed down by old monks. Writing good essays, doing well in mathematics, having a wealth of knowledge, and having doctoral and master's degrees grandly engraved on business cards, but a two-legged cabinet is still a two-legged cabinet, if it encounters an accident, oh my God, essays and mathematics cannot save life! This reporter really doubts the current education that only focuses on dead knowledge! Why can't safety awareness penetrate people's hearts? Why is the cultivation of safe intelligence and habits not yet widespread?

Safety education is "life-saving education," an indispensable education for life. In a narrow sense, "safety education is training people to avoid their own accidental injuries and prevent the accidental injuries of others." But in fact, it is not that simple. Safety education is not just about preventing accidental injuries, so let's have a broader meaning: "Safety education is to preserve the valuable essentials of life—health opportunities and resource materials that life itself relies on." Its contents should include the following: (1) First aid, (2) Causes and prevention of various means of transportation, (3) Social protection of human life, health, and property, (4) Safety programs run by central and local governments, (7) Factory safety, (8) Activities of safety patrol teams, (9) Fire prevention, (10) Health safety, (11) Natural resource protection, (12) Industrial and transportation safety.

"A wound from a knife is good, but not cutting is better." Education on preventing death and injury should focus on "prevention." According to a report in last month's "Coronet" magazine, according to recent expert experiments, only preventive education can truly solve safety problems. Before an accident occurs, the application of skills and imagination in safety education is the only good strategy to ensure safety. Here, this reporter would like to add a sentence, hoping that the educational institutions themselves have sufficient safety, so that they can better lead by example and achieve twice the result with half the effort. New Year's Eve, 1946.

### To Meet National Defense Needs, Border Superintendency Offices are Changed to National Border Police Bureaus, with a Total of 20 Locations Set Up at Key Points

[Kunming Report from Our Newspaper on the 13th] To meet national defense needs, the government has decided to change the structures of the various Border Superintendency Offices to National Border Police Bureaus.

### Sichuan Province's Last Year to Eradicate Opium Addiction, Forcefully Enforcing Complete Prohibition of Planting, Thoroughly Suppressing Yi Bandits Resisting Orders Deep in the Daliang Mountains

[Report from Chengdu by Our Newspaper] This year is the last year for the total prohibition of opium addiction in Sichuan Province. The provincial government has decided to fully eradicate the opium problem that has plagued Sichuan for decades, and to forcefully enforce the prohibition of planting. Currently, a large number of Yi bandits are entrenched in the Daliang Mountains on the border of Sichuan and Kangding, resisting planting by force. The leader Ahe 　 Muzi has gathered more than 40,000 Yi bandits and organized a fake "Commander-in-Chief's Office for Suppressing the Han," looting in all directions. The provinces of Sichuan and Kangding have organized a bandit suppression headquarters, dispatched troops to suppress the bandits, and sent airplanes to assist in the suppression. After a month of fierce fighting, the military progress is very rapid. The troops have penetrated deep into the Yi areas, engaged in forest warfare, and the Yi 　 chaos will be quelled in a short time. In the 15th and 16th districts of the Sichuan border region, in counties such as Leibo, Ma, Ping, Emei, Songli, 　 Wen, etc., the provincial government has thoroughly reorganized the Baojia system, and dispatched strong forces to suppress and monitor the prohibition of planting. In addition, more than 300 demobilized young soldiers in Chengdu have jointly petitioned the government to organize all the demobilized young soldiers in Sichuan into the Sichuan Province Anti-Opium Brigade, equipped with new-style weapons, to carry out the armed opium prohibition work, which the provincial government is considering.

[Report from Chengdu by Our Newspaper] Sichuan Province has interwoven waterways and crisscrossing rivers. Waterway security is extremely unstable. Since winter, there have been frequent incidents of gangsters robbing passenger boats and travelers, and even illegally setting up checkpoints along the way. According to an investigation by the Sichuan Water Police Bureau, bandits collect illegal taxes along the river, including grain transport tax, civilization donation, canal opening fee, drifting tax, anchoring fee, escort fee, etc., which travelers deeply resent. The provincial government has decided to thoroughly improve waterway security from this year, strengthen the firepower of the water police bureau, expand joint land-water defense, widely install wireless radios in Chengdu, Leshan and other places, and equip many new-style river patrol boats, launch a joint land-water suppression, and strive to thoroughly eradicate the waterway security problem in Sichuan in a short period of time.

### Zhejiang Province Ordered to Divide into Eleven Suppression Zones, Bandits to be Pacified Before the End of Next Month, Jiangsu Province Adjusts Security Teams to Ensure Security

[Report from Hangzhou by Our Newspaper] The Zhejiang Provincial Government recently received an order from the Central Government, instructing that the eleven administrative districts of the province be divided into eleven suppression zones, and that bandits in each county be completely suppressed by the end of February this year to secure the local area and benefit the people's livelihood. The provincial government has already ordered the special commissioner's offices in each district to forward the order to the counties for compliance, and should effectively cooperate with the local people's forces to suppress the bandits as scheduled.

[Report from Zhenjiang by Our Newspaper] The Jiangsu Provincial Government believes that after a year of suppression of scattered bandits in the Jiangnan area, the overall security has been basically stabilized. However, the remaining bandits in a few areas still need to be continuously suppressed. Although various places in northern Jiangsu have been gradually recovered, they are still in a period of pacification. In order to ensure the security of the counties in southern Jiangsu, pacify the scattered bandits in the counties in northern Jiangsu, adapt to the current environmental needs, and take into account the actual conditions of the counties, this year's (1947) adjustment plan for the county security teams has been specially formulated. Regarding the security teams in the counties and districts of southern Jiangsu, adjustments should be made according to the current security situation and the future needs of the local area, and adapting to the financial situation of the counties. The first, second, and third district security command headquarters will still be based on organizing one company as a principle. The county magistrates of southern Jiangsu should re-determine the necessary security force in each county based on the security situation and financial situation, with no less than one company and no more than four companies.

### Exhausted from Running Around to Pay Grain Taxes, Please Establish a General Office

Songjiang Grain Office Accepts the Suggestion

[Our Newspaper Songjiang Dispatch] Since the implementation of in-kind tax collection in this county, the original system has been changed. If a general office is not established in the urban and rural areas and a zonal payment system is implemented, landlords who own fields in various zones will be exhausted from running around to pay taxes, which is a major obstacle to promoting grain administration. In order to facilitate tax payment, the Grain Office has established a grain agency at the Rice Industry Association, but this is not a fundamental solution. Therefore, county residents Wu Boyang and Zhang Buxiu specially requested the Grain Office to promptly establish a general office in the urban and rural areas so that landlords can pay all the taxes for fields in various zones at the general office for convenience. After receiving the report, the Grain Office considered that the suggestions were insightful and has instructed the relevant departments to properly formulate a plan and submit it to the provincial office for approval.

### Communist Soldiers Harass the Jiangmian Area of Sidunzi, Capsizing Two Ships

Because the operation was smooth, it successively recovered Dongtai Jiancheng. On the fifth of this month, it was ordered to return to the port.

### The Anglo-Burmese Conference Opens in London; Burma Demands Complete Independence; Willing to Fight a War for Freedom if Necessary; Britain Must Accept Burma's Counter-Proposal by the End of This Month

[Reuters London Thirteenth Dispatch] The Anglo-Burmese Round Table Conference began today at 10 Downing Street. Prime Minister Attlee and Lord Lawrence, Minister for India and Burma Affairs, delivered welcoming speeches to the Burmese representatives. According to our agency's diplomatic correspondent, the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League, led by Burmese chief representative Aung San, aims to achieve complete independence for Burma within one year. The British government's goal is to establish a fully autonomous government for Burma. Prime Minister Attlee has made it clear that the Burmese people should decide for themselves whether to remain within the British Commonwealth.

[Agence France-Presse London Twelfth Dispatch] The Burmese delegation, led by Deputy Prime Minister Aung San, arrived in London several days ago at the invitation of the British government. They are scheduled to meet with representatives of the British government at 10 Downing Street, the British Prime Minister's residence, tomorrow to discuss the future of Burma. It is expected to last until the end of this month. The purpose of the Burmese delegation's visit to London is to demand complete independence for Burma. Therefore, it is expected that the discussions tomorrow will be very heated. The Burmese delegation will put forward several demands, including (1) the immediate establishment of a provisional national government to replace the existing Executive Council; and (2) the holding of general elections in the spring of this year to prepare everything for Burma's independence.

[Associated Press London Twelfth Dispatch] A prominent Burmese figure said today that Burma is fully prepared to fight, if necessary, to secede from Britain and achieve complete independence.

Burmese anti-Japanese hero General Aung San has led a delegation here and has set a deadline of the 30th of this month for Britain to accept Burma's counter-proposal. Aung San denied that he did not believe in Britain's sincerity, but said that the method of implementing the proposals often rendered the proposals themselves meaningless.

### It Is Reported That Byrnes Has Drafted an Outline of American Foreign Policy to Be Left for the New Secretary of State to Consider and Handle

[United Press Washington Twelfth Dispatch] It has recently been learned from here that Byrnes has drafted a written outline of current American foreign policy to be left for Marshall to handle. It is said that the contents are very detailed, explaining almost every country in the world. This is a valuable achievement of Byrnes's eighteen-month tenure as Secretary of State. The contents are strictly confidential and can only be consulted by a few people. They are currently being kept in Byrnes's personal custody. After Marshall arrives in Washington, D.C., he will receive them. When Byrnes first took office, the United States' foreign policy towards various countries needed to be formulated by him, and the task was arduous. Now, Marshall can proceed according to his outline, which should not be too complicated.

### Two Major Soviet Newspapers Comment on the American Political Situation

Believe That Foreign Policy Will Not Change

Pay Special Attention to Baruch's Resignation

[Associated Press Moscow Twelfth Dispatch] Two major Soviet newspapers commented on the American political situation today. "Pravda" commented on Marshall's transfer to Secretary of State, saying that the Republican-dominated Congress quickly approved the appointment, which shows that American foreign policy remains unchanged. "Izvestia" commented on the resignation of Baruch, the American representative to the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission, believing that he had coerced the passage of his atomic control plan by threatening that the United States would not support the United Nations. This plan was opposed by the Soviet Union, and this coercion was one of the reasons for Baruch's resignation. Another possible reason is that Baruch's position has aroused dissatisfaction from Jewish circles related to him. The newspaper did not conceal that Baruch's resignation was a harbinger of greater flexibility in the United States' atomic control policy. "Izvestia" also said that some members of the American parliament intend to stimulate their "predatory desires" and obtain a part of the Kuril Islands from the Soviet Union to build military bases. The US House of Representatives Naval Committee has fantasized about establishing defenses to defend the northern wing of the United States' central Pacific defense line in the Aleutian and Kuril Islands. These people have forgotten that the Kuril Islands belong to the Soviet Union, and if they are still greedy, it is difficult to hide their coveting of other countries' territories.

### British "Spectator" Weekly Explains Montgomery's Visit to the Soviet Union

[British Information Services London Thirteenth Dispatch] The "Spectator" weekly recently commented on the Chief of the Imperial General Staff's recent visit to the Soviet Union, saying: "This industry has caused various speculations about the motives of the British and Soviet governments. Asking whether this move by Britain reflects a change of heart on the part of the government or is a soothing object to soften the recent rebels within the Labor Party is a waste of time. It is also doubtful whether the Soviet government, for some reason, we do not know whether it is good or bad, has decided to launch a pro-British campaign. Such suspicion is also meaningless. The above questions cannot only not give a practical answer, but the question itself is flawed. What we know is that Marshal Montgomery is now going to the Soviet Union to make contact with the Soviet army and discuss military affairs. He has stated that a few days of his trip can only be slightly higher than a symbol. Before Anglo-Soviet cooperation has become a reality, there are many things to discuss, and countless new contacts need to be established by military and civilian parties. The Chief of the Imperial General Staff has indeed invited Vaslevsky, who is equal to his status, to visit Britain, and Marshal Stalin has already expressed his acceptance. However, the Chief of Staff's visit does not necessarily have other motives besides the usual courtesy visit."

### Montgomery Cables Thanks to Stalin

[Our Newspaper News] London Thirteenth Broadcast: After returning to England from the Soviet Union, Marshal Montgomery sent a telegram to Marshal Stalin, stating briefly: "I am deeply grateful for the warm hospitality of your country's army in Moscow. I will never forget your Excellency's words of advice to the British army." He also sent a telegram to Vaslevsky, saying: "I am deeply grateful for your detailed instructions on matters related to the organization and training of the Soviet army."

### Unrest in Palestine; Another Bombing Incident; British Police Station in Haifa Leveled to the Ground; Jewish Underground Army Announces End of Truce

[Agence France-Presse Jerusalem Thirteenth Dispatch] A huge bomb exploded in the port area of Haifa last night. Its importance is second only to the King David Hotel bombing. It is generally believed that yesterday's atrocity was committed by the "Islamic Freedom Fighters," because a Jewish newspaper received a letter at 11:00 p.m. last night, signed with the name "Freedom Fighters," claiming that the case was committed by them. At that time, two British police officers and two Palestinian police officers were killed in the port area, and nine British police officers and fifty Palestinian police officers were injured. The bomb was driven to the scene by a person dressed in military uniform. When the police station guards checked his identity, the person abandoned the car and fled. A bomb was found in the car, but it was too late to remove it. People evacuated together, and it exploded in less than three minutes, destroying many houses. The number of deaths and injuries is as above. After the incident, traffic between the urban area and the residential area was cut off, and a curfew was imposed from 8:00 p.m. The atmosphere in Tel Aviv was also tense, and a state of emergency was declared. Although this case was not committed by Jewish terrorist parties, political figures believe that the conflict between Jewish moderates and terrorist parties may develop into a civil war.

[Associated Press Jerusalem Thirteenth Dispatch] The government gazette announced yesterday that the Haifa police station had been leveled to the ground by rioters, four police officers had been killed, and 142 other police officers and civilians had been injured. After the explosion, nearby fires broke out, and shattered pieces of glass flew a mile away. According to a United Press report, it was learned today that four people were killed and one hundred people were injured in the Haifa British police station bombing. The curfew imposed by the British army to search for terrorists was lifted this morning.

[Associated Press Jerusalem Twelfth Dispatch] According to the government announcement, the time of the incident was 5:10 p.m. Three minutes before the explosion, a car carrying explosives drove along the police station, and the people in the car had fled. The police station was unwilling to formally announce who the perpetrators were. Only one police officer said, "It seems that the terrorist parties are active again." It is rumored here that the terrorist parties had announced a truce last week to negotiate the proposal for a Jewish independent state in Palestine. An hour after the explosion, a Jewish secret radio station denied that Jewish underground elements had stopped the riots and resistance. Officials announced that the car loaded with explosives was marked with the words "police station," and the driver was also disguised as a policeman. When the driver and two Jewish youths jumped out of the car and fled, the police station guards fired several shots at them. When they saw the fuse on the car igniting, they issued an alarm, and the people in the station rushed out and safely escaped. Fifteen people escaped safely. This was the first major explosion in six weeks. Double posts were stationed around all public buildings after the incident.

### Security Council Reviews the Corfu Incident

[Our Newspaper News] San Francisco Thirteenth Broadcast: Representatives of the United Nations Security Council are currently reviewing the complaint filed by the United Kingdom regarding the Albanian Corfu Strait mine explosion.

The Council still needs to decide on how to limit armaments. According to reports, the United States has suggested that the issue of atomic energy should be considered first when implementing arms limitation, but the Soviet Union has moved that the entire issue of disarmament should be addressed at the same time.

[Agence France-Presse Paris Thirteenth Dispatch] At the invitation of British Prime Minister Attlee, French Prime Minister Blum left here this afternoon at 3:00 p.m. on a British special plane to visit London. It is said that the purpose of this trip is to discuss various economic issues related to the interests of the two countries. The coal problem is also likely to be one of the topics of discussion. France is scheduled to elect a president on the afternoon of the 16th of this month, at which time Prime Minister Blum will be able to rush back to Paris.

[Agence France-Presse London Thirteenth Dispatch] Prime Minister Blum's visit to the United Kingdom was sudden, and the official here remained completely silent. However, a spokesperson for the Foreign Office said that a statement will be issued this afternoon regarding this matter. The French Embassy here will host a banquet tonight to welcome Blum and his party.

[Reuters Paris Thirteenth Dispatch] The reason for French Prime Minister Blum's sudden visit to the United Kingdom and the content of his talks with British cabinet members have not been announced. Foreign Ministry officials said that Blum's trip may be related to France's participation in the Anglo-American economic unification system of Germany.

[Reuters Paris Thirteenth Dispatch] A political crisis is likely to occur when the French Senate and House of Representatives reconvene on Tuesday. In addition to dealing with the different political demands of the Communist Party and the Popular Republican Movement, the Congress will also discuss the General Confederation of Labor's request to increase wages. The two houses are scheduled to hold a joint meeting at the Palace of Versailles on the 16th of this month to elect the president of the Fourth Republic. After the president is elected, Blum's Socialist cabinet will resign, and the fifth cabinet crisis since the general election in November of last year will begin. Although both the Communist Party and the Popular Republican Movement want to regain power, it is doubtful whether they can reach an agreement. It is generally expected that the Communist Party may be more compromising in demanding cabinet positions than last year, but their support for the General Confederation of Labor's wage increase request will be a new obstacle to the agreement of the parties. The Popular Republican Movement will continue to demand the establishment of the cabinet's true responsibility and prevent parties from using the Ministry of Interior as a "political fortress" again. In Blum's five weeks in power, the tension between the Communist Party and the Popular Republican Movement seems to have increased.

### Mou Tai Visits Blum to Report on the Situation in Vietnam

Claiming the Viet Minh Cannot Represent All the People

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, December 12th] Popien, a member of the directing committee of the French Socialist Party, who accompanied the Minister of Overseas Colonies, Mou Tai, on an inspection tour of Vietnam, returned here and told reporters: Although the Haiphong conflict was partly the fault of the French side, the events that occurred in Hanoi were clearly planned in advance by the Viet Minh, who then launched the attack. The Viet Minh would rather resort to violence than adopt a policy of negotiation with France. Extremists are in the majority within the Viet Minh, and their actions are entirely controlled by the extremists. However, there will be a way for France to establish an agreement with Vietnamese people who genuinely represent the people. Minister Mou Tai also said upon disembarking today: The French troops in Vietnam are brave and good at fighting, which is commendable. I have discovered that the military situation in Vietnam is unstable, so at this moment, we can only ensure the safety of our own people and friends. The current problem is to restore order. Although there are still many difficulties ahead, if we can establish an agreement with Vietnamese people who genuinely represent the people, the difficulties will naturally be resolved, and peace can thus be restored. Minister Mou Tai met with Prime Minister Blum today to report on the trip, which lasted for a considerable time.

### Fierce Battle Unfolds in Hanoi District

Vietnamese Troops Will Fight to the End

[Reuters, Hanoi, December 12th] The situation in Hanoi remains tense. The French troops surrounding the fortress district, numbering approximately four to five thousand, will not attack until the evacuation negotiations have yielded results. The Vietnamese army had previously declared that it would fight to the last bullet. This statement was not a joke, as fierce battles have unfolded in every house and room within the Xu Dong area of Hanoi since the outbreak of war on December 19th. The food situation within the fortress district has reached a critical stage. The army does not allow food to be transported in, and the remaining supplies are almost exhausted.

[Agence France-Presse, Toulon, France, December 13th] The French mail ship "France Islands" sailed from Toulon yesterday, carrying 8,000 soldiers to reinforce Vietnam, along with ammunition.

Vietnamese Troops Fiercely Resist Surrender

[Reuters, Paris, December 12th] A semi-official French source in Hanoi reports: When French troops were conducting a sweep of Vietnamese troops near the Hanoi airfield today, they first encountered Vietnamese suicide squads, who, unwilling to be captured by the French, threw themselves onto exploding hand grenades and committed suicide.

### Britain Releases Secret Files

Concerning the Establishment of the United States of Europe

[United Press, London, December 13th] Documents that have been classified as confidential by the British Foreign Office were released today. They reveal that in 1930, Britain's attitude towards the proposal to establish the United States of Europe was extremely cold. At that time, French Foreign Minister Briand led the effort to unite the European countries, hoping that they would cooperate closely with each other in pursuit of peace and prosperity, but this dream was not realized. There were two reasons: one was that the Nazi trend within Germany was growing and vehemently opposed this proposal, and the other was that Britain did not agree to this kind of union. The beginning and end of this matter are recorded in the British government's external documents released today. The British obstruction at that time has now attracted the attention of all circles, with much debate, because the plan advocated by Briand in 1930 is similar to the one proposed by Churchill today.

### South African Parliament to Open Next Tuesday, Presided Over by the British King

[Agence France-Presse, Cape Town, December 12th] The Parliament of the Union of South Africa is scheduled to open here on the 21st of this month, at which time King George VI of Great Britain will personally preside and deliver a speech. Regarding the resolution passed by the United Nations General Assembly, which advocates that South Africa and India should first establish an agreement on the issue of Indian minorities before the next session of the United Nations General Assembly, it will be discussed as soon as the South African Parliament opens. It is the first time that the British King has presided over the opening ceremony of the Parliament of a dominion.

### A Batch of Our Technical Personnel in the United States Has Completed Training

[Central News Agency, New York, December 12th, Special Dispatch] A batch of our technical personnel, led by Major Zhang Yangbo (transliteration), a veteran of our Air Force, has now completed training. What they have received is training that will enable them to manufacture and assemble aircraft engines in new factories in China. This batch of technical personnel was sent to the United States by our government and trained at the training school of a major aircraft factory. They received training in the manufacture of engines and the maintenance of aircraft engines by the factory's engineers. It is understood that following this batch of technical personnel, our government will continue to send personnel to the United States to study various aspects of American aircraft manufacturing technology, so that our country will be able to manufacture all the commercial aircraft we need in the future.

### On the Eve of the Polish General Election, Riots Intensify

The U.S. Congress Advocates Severing Relations with Poland

[United Press, Warsaw, December 12th] The riots before the Polish election intensified today. Mobs destroyed stores opened by members of the opposition Peasant Party and beat Peasant Party members who were distributing leaflets. The government sent pro-communist members to inform the workers of various factories that they should vote in favor of the government, otherwise they would face unemployment. The Security Department announced that 4,000 secret workers had been arrested in the past ninety days, and 600 people had been assassinated during the same period. The leader of the Peasant Party, Mikolajczyk, stated that approximately 5,000 members of his party had been arrested recently, most of whom were arrested a second time after being released.

[United Press, New York, December 13th] The U.S. Congress has recently urged President Truman to sever diplomatic relations with the Polish government. The reasons are roughly as follows: Terrorist incidents have occurred repeatedly during the twenty months that the Polish government has been in power, which is sufficient to prove that it has no ability to govern and is not supported by the Polish people.

### Sudan's Autonomy Movement Opposes the Plan to Merge with Egypt

[Agence France-Presse, Khartoum, British-Egyptian Sudan, December 12th] Within Sudan, the voices opposing the merger with Egypt from the autonomy movement are gradually gaining strength. The tribal chiefs of northern Sudan have unanimously expressed their support for the various parties' plans to oppose the merger with Egypt and have jointly issued a memorandum explaining the views of the tribes of northern Sudan, demanding independence and the implementation of autonomy. In southern Sudan, opinions are divided on the issue of merging with Egypt. The rural black people have no opinion, but people in the cities who are influenced by Arab culture support the proposal to merge with Egypt.

### With Implementation of Reparations Imminent, Japan Considers Levying a Reparations Tax

[Kaizo Sha, Tokyo, December 13th] A cable states that the United States has decided to immediately dismantle and transport Japanese reparations goods. The Japanese government has specifically included dismantling and transportation costs in the 1947 budget as an additional budget for this decision. However, the amount of transportation costs required is still unclear because the scope of the dismantled goods, the dismantling period, and the order of dismantling have not been clarified, so a decision cannot be made for the time being. Last year, the Ministry of Commerce and Industry estimated that 35 billion yen would be needed, but due to the subsequent rise in prices and the expansion of reparations goods, it is expected that the amount will be higher than this number. As for the source of these expenses, it is reported that the Japanese government is considering levying a reparations tax, so that all citizens can share the burden.

### The Japanese Political Situation Is Increasingly Urgent, Yoshida Has an Audience with the Emperor

[Kaizo Sha, Tokyo, December 13th] Japanese Prime Minister Yoshida entered the palace at 4:30 this afternoon to have an audience with the Emperor and report on the recent political situation. Before entering the palace, Yoshida first met with State Minister and President of the Progressive Party, Shidehara, and after leaving the palace, he immediately convened senior members of the Liberal Party to explain the plan to form a coalition cabinet and seek the understanding of the party's senior members. The Secretary-General of the Progressive Party, Tanaka, met with Shidehara and State Minister Saito today and said: The political situation has become urgent. Now is not the time for the Liberal and Progressive parties to discuss agreements on policies. The Progressive Party's plan for the political situation was decided a month ago. To break through the current situation, it is necessary to have groundbreaking social policies. To implement social policies, it is necessary to establish a coalition cabinet of the Liberal, Progressive, and Socialist parties. If the reorganization of the cabinet cannot solve the personnel problems, the only option is to implement a general resignation.

[Kaizo Sha, Tokyo, December 13th] The Japanese political situation is becoming increasingly turbulent. With Secretary-General Nishio as the center, the Socialist Party's senior members are constantly in close contact with various parties to prepare for changes in the political situation, but before the Central Executive Committee convenes on the 14th, they are adopting a wait-and-see attitude and not formally expressing their attitude.

### The Ground in Kochi Prefecture, Japan, Has Sunk, Affected by the Earthquake

[United Press, Tokyo, December 13th] It is reported that since the earthquake and tsunami that occurred on December 21st last year, the ground in Kochi Prefecture, Shikoku Island, has sunk below the horizontal line, so there is a proposal for the prefecture to move to higher ground.

### The Tonnage of American Merchant Ships Will Decrease by 39% This Year

[United Press, Washington, December 12th] The American Merchant Marine National Association recently revealed that American merchant ships will decrease by 39% this year, leaving 17.5 million tons. This measure will have an adverse impact on the entire national economy, which is actually due to the improper handling of the authorities' political and economic measures.

### Mount Mayon in the Philippines Erupts Violently, Lava Rises to 10,000 Feet

### A Major Problem After the War: How to Stabilize the World?

……If some people in the world are well-fed and well-clothed, while others are not, resentment will inevitably arise, leading to war. If we want to stabilize the world, we must treat the symptoms and eliminate these morbid conditions……

[United Press, Lake Success, December 12th] Representatives from fifteen countries on the Economic and Employment Committee of the United Nations will meet here on the 20th of this month to discuss the issue of employment for people all over the world and how to eliminate the economic downturn, as preparation for the next meeting of the Economic and Social Council.

Thorough Investigation of World Resources

The United States will advocate in the committee to use thorough methods to discuss and make a global asset comparison table showing world resources. The establishment of the Economic and Social Council is based on a belief that if some people in the world are well-fed, well-housed, and live in comfort, while others are not well-fed, well-clothed, and not well-housed, resentment will inevitably arise, leading to war. Therefore, the task of the Council is to treat the economic and social morbid conditions that can lead to war, hoping to eventually eliminate them. However, the problems involved are extremely complex, and humanity has not yet been able to solve them. The Council has seven committees to help it proceed, which will begin meeting at the end of February. Part of the task of the Economic and Employment Committee is to guide the Council on how it can raise the standard of living of the people. For example, the nutritional problems of Chinese workers, the housing problems of people in European war zones, and the working problems of people in South America and the untouchable class in India are all topics that the committee plans to discuss and solve. The representative of the United States to the Economic and Employment Committee, the former Director of the Bureau of Statistics of the Department of Labor, Rubin, said: If we want to properly formulate a plan and hope to succeed, we must first know what we have and where it is. In other words, we must first compile a comparison table showing all the human skills, minerals, forests, factories, farms, and their locations throughout the world.

Empty Talk Does Not Help

If we do not know how much milk can be produced, it is useless to talk about each person drinking one pound of milk a day. People cannot operate factories built in culturally backward areas. If we do not base our actions on facts, we will waste a lot of time and energy. Some representatives oppose compiling a world asset comparison table, believing that the task is too difficult, impossible to implement, and that many countries do not know their own resources and will only answer based on guesswork. Rubin admits that this work will take at least five years, but investigating the facts is crucial to the task of the committee. For investigations in culturally backward areas, the following tasks should be carried out: (1) Improve the lives of the people and help them heal their corrupted wounds, so as to prevent the breeding of war germs. (2) Open up vast markets to absorb the production of other countries, so that their workers can obtain work.

Chinese People Should Be Noticed

There are also many people in China whose living standards are extremely low, and most of them are farmers and workers, but relying only on agriculture, they cannot obtain abundant food, clothing, and housing. To raise the standard of living of the people, it is necessary to develop industry to help them. If we want to help the Chinese people raise their standard of living, we must first know the sources of their power, the convenience of transportation, and natural resources, and we must also know how long it will take to train Chinese engineers to set up factories and Chinese workers to work. The second subcommittee to be established will be the Committee on Employment and Economic Stability, whose task is to pay attention to international commerce and international trade events, and to warn the Council if there is a danger of turmoil.

Refugee Agency Schedules Meeting

[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, New York, December 12th] The Secretariat of the United Nations has recently announced that the Preparatory Committee of the International Refugee Organization is scheduled to hold its first meeting on the 11th of this month.

### London Truck Drivers Continue Strike, Government Sends Troops to Transport Food

[United Press, London, December 12th] Shops in London have had no one to deliver goods since the beginning of last week due to the truck drivers' strike. Today, the striking drivers have rejected the final appeal of the union chairman and voted by a large majority to continue the strike.

[United Press, London, December 12th] Prime Minister Attlee is scheduled to convene a cabinet meeting on the 13th to discuss the situation. The government has announced that certain temporary emergency measures will be implemented tomorrow morning, so as to use military vehicles and mobilize personnel from the army, navy, and air force to replace the 20,000 striking workers. One hundred naval trucks and fifty army trucks have arrived in London. A union spokesperson said: The army's interference in the strike will spark a sympathy strike by food porters and public car, tram, and subway workers. It is reported that some cabinet members oppose mobilizing the army. These people were previously union cadres.

[United Press, London, December 12th] A week after the British transport workers went on strike, 400 British troops, under the orders of Prime Minister Attlee, went to the vegetable market in the city center this morning to distribute food, and the stallholders withdrew from the market one after another to show their sympathy for the transport workers.

[Reuters, London, December 13th] Five thousand three hundred food workers in London went on strike this morning after the army began transporting food from the striking meat warehouses at 10:30 this morning.

### One of the Major Tasks of the United Nations: International Anti-Drug Work

Dr. Gu Weijun, our representative to the United Nations General Assembly and ambassador to the United States, has repeatedly given speeches, emphasizing the importance of the international ban on the illegal sale of narcotics and the full support of our government for this work. This article provides a brief overview of the international anti-drug problem.

The work of international control of narcotics will be handled by the United Nations. Its work program is to limit the use of opium to medical and scientific needs, and to prevent the remaining narcotics from being privately traded on the illegal market.

The work of controlling narcotics involves many issues, especially the dispatch of representatives from world organizations to various member countries to supervise the production and consumption of narcotics. This work is the most important, but judging from the responses of various countries in the world today, this point should not cause much difficulty.

Among the member countries of the United Nations, only Turkey and Yugoslavia are currently still growing poppies to extract opium. These two countries will be invited to accept the inspection system, provide production figures, and limit their exports to legal needs.

However, the difficulty lies in the fact that poppies are widely grown all over the world because the poppy seeds can be used to extract extremely useful poppy oil. Scientists have discovered that after the poppy seeds are harvested, the roots can still be used to extract morphine. The opium industry is crucial to the economies of Turkey and Yugoslavia, but due to the extraction of morphine from poppy roots in other countries, the market has been shrinking day by day. However, in order to carry out its work, the United Nations Narcotics Commission must limit the production of narcotics to medical needs. Those who extract morphine from poppy roots can only use their products for their own countries, and at the same time, it is stipulated that countries that produce opium must sell their products to countries that do not grow opium at a fixed price.

The work of controlling the manufacture and distribution of narcotics was previously handled by the League of Nations, but in addition to doing some work in publicity, the League of Nations did not have effective measures to carry out its proposals. According to General MacArthur's report, Japan has always kept two different records of opium production and consumption, one for its own reference and the other to perfunctorily deal with the League of Nations on the surface.

The United Nations must use more effective methods to achieve its mission. The next action of the Narcotics Commission will be to internationally supervise poppy production. At the same time, the increasing number of member countries of the United Nations can also make international control of narcotics more effective.

In addition to emphasizing the raw material production of narcotics, the United Nations Narcotics Commission will also prohibit the illegal transportation of narcotics, because before the war, the illegal transportation of drugs totaled millions of dollars a year. At the same time, it will also discuss the issues of artificial drugs, as well as the investigation and restoration of control over opium use in various countries that have escaped the war.

Although Spain was one of the signatories to the previous international anti-drug treaties, it has not been invited to participate in the discussions of the United Nations Narcotics Commission because some member countries believe that such an invitation would give Franco a foothold in the United Nations. The fact that Spain has not been invited to participate may be a weakness, but the representatives of various countries on the Narcotics Commission believe that it will not have much impact. Since other countries must publish detailed statistics on narcotics imports and exports, it would be difficult to discover if Spain wanted to sell something. In recent years, the habit of opium use in Asia has been greatly reduced because the government's monopoly on sales has been abolished. Currently, only Thailand and India still adopt this system, but it is expected that the new Indian government will soon abandon this monopoly. Iran was previously a major opium-producing country, but it stopped growing poppies in the summer of last year and has recently banned the open sale of opium. In Japan, the occupying authorities have purged it. France has abandoned its monopoly in Vietnam, and Portugal has also taken the same measures in Macau. The new Indonesian Republic will generally maintain the prohibitions previously issued by the Dutch government.

The fact that quite a few demobilized soldiers after World War II have become addicted to drugs has caused great concern to the authorities of various countries. Whether it is the Allied or Axis armies, they may have developed the bad habit of opium use in order to use morphine to anesthetize the pain caused by wounds. However, Anslinger, the American representative to the Narcotics Commission, believes that the high price of illegal narcotics will make it impossible for most people to buy them. According to investigations, before the war, opium in the United States cost ten U.S. dollars, but it has now risen to one thousand U.S. dollars. Previously, the price of heroin was similar to that of opium for a time, but it has now risen to four thousand U.S. dollars. In Europe, narcotics are valuable items in the black market, and their value is far above gold.

In short, solving the problem of prohibiting narcotics is one of the most confident tasks of the United Nations, and countries around the world will be able to quickly show their unity of attitude. Of course, the United Nations does not harbor the extravagant hope of completely eliminating the illegal sale of drugs, but it is indeed possible to reduce it to the lowest level.

### Unprecedented Drug Case: Morphin King's Old Residence Found to Have Six Large Gunny Sacks of Opium Hidden in the Cellar, Weighing Over a Thousand Pounds and Worth 3.3 Billion

[Reported by This Newspaper] The Inspection Office of the Garrison Headquarters received information that a large amount of opium was secretly hidden at 31 Dade Lane, Linsen Middle Road. Deputy Director Zheng Chongwei of the Inspection Office, together with Chief Zhao Dan of the Changshu Branch Bureau, led officers and police to rush to the address. As expected, they found large sacks of opium buried in the soil under the flower bed in the courtyard, totaling 1,058 pounds. They then took the owner of the house, Pei Dehe, also known as Yuanjun (34 years old), a native of Danyang (manager of the Shenkang Factory on Guangdong Road), to the bureau. According to him, the house previously belonged to the Zhou family, and was later rented to the morphine king Ye Qinghe. In the 30th year of the Republic (1941), Ye fled without a trace due to a case, and then the Shi family moved in. Before a year had passed, Shi sold the house to Pei Dehe. After Pei renovated the house, he was discovered by the gardener Zhou Asan (43 years old, a native of Wuxi) that a large amount of opium was buried under the flower bed in the courtyard. At that time, because it was during the enemy and puppet period, he dared not report it rashly. Therefore, it has been delayed until now. The six large sacks of opium are currently stored in the branch bureau. It is said that the opium is estimated to be worth 338.56 million yuan at the current market price of 200,000 yuan in legal tender per tael. In past opium and drug cases solved by the Shanghai police authorities, this case, in which more than 1,000 pounds of opium were seized at one time, is the first.

### Carefully Reviewing the City Budget, the City Council Decides to Extend the Session to Continue Discussing Various Proposals Today

[Reported by This Newspaper] The first session of the Second Congress of the City Council was originally scheduled to adjourn yesterday morning. However, due to the large number of cases discussed, it was not possible to conclude. In addition to continuing the meeting yesterday afternoon, the eighth meeting will be extended for half a day this afternoon to continue discussing important proposals. However, because the budget for the 36th year is of great importance, it cannot be hastily decided during the conference period. Therefore, it was decided at yesterday's meeting to postpone the meeting and discuss it again. The term of the postponement was not specified, about three or four weeks. During the postponement period, the review of the budget was authorized to the Finance, Budget and Final Accounts, and Legal Affairs committees. The other relevant committees were asked to assist in the investigation of personnel and administration of various bureaus.

Councilor Xu Yongzuo, representing the Budget and Final Accounts Committee, reported to the Congress yesterday several times on the review of the budget and believed that before the postponement of the meeting, there were several review preparation tasks that should be paid attention to: (1) It is necessary to determine how many affiliated institutions the municipal government needs during the review and investigate whether the affiliated institutions are duplicated. (2) Establish the central work plan for the 36th year. (3) Determine the amount of various tax revenues in the city for several months. (4) Establish a clear understanding of the past financial situation, such as verifying the accounts of receivables and payables, accumulated surpluses or losses.

Mayor Wu expressed his opinion: He expressed his respect for the review opinions of the budget and praised the responsible spirit of the councilors. He agreed with the issue of layoffs and advocated postponing the meeting to March 6, because the tax collection in February can get a result on March 6, so that the actual collection situation after the tax rate reduction can be known for reference by the Congress.

In addition to reporting on the review of the budget, Wang Jian'e reported on the opinions of the review of the municipal government's central work plan for the 36th year, which was approved by the Congress without objection.

### Standard for Private School Tuition Increase Causes a Debate Parents Like Old Oxen, Unable to Bear the Burden An Opposition Voice at the Meeting Will Be Decided Again Today

[Our Newspaper's Report] The issue of private school political fees for the next semester (the second semester of the 35th academic year) sparked a fierce debate during yesterday afternoon's Senate meeting. According to the Mayor's proposal, the standard set by the Education Bureau is 100,000 to 150,000 for elementary schools, 150,000 to 200,000 for junior high schools, and 200,000 to 250,000 for senior high schools. The reason is that the tuition standard for the last semester was 80,000 to 120,000 for elementary schools, 120,000 to 160,000 for junior high schools, and 160,000 to 200,000 for senior high schools. Now, according to the principals of private primary and secondary schools, it is proposed to increase the treatment according to the proportion of the cost of living index. According to the cost of living index of employees in July, it is 3683 times, and the cost of living index in December is 5350 times, which is an increase of 45%. However, in order to reduce the burden on parents and improve the lives of teachers, the tuition standard is set to increase by 25% compared with the last semester.

### Tuition Standard for Last Semester Was Already 8,000 Times Pre-War

Jiang Huaisu, Chen Boliang, Huang Bingquan, Xie Dahuang, Fei Shusheng, and others rose up in opposition, believing that the tuition standard for the last semester was more than eight times that before the war, which was very unreasonable. Since the last semester had already taken advantage of the situation, it is impossible to add more this semester. Education is different from general profit-making businesses, and cannot be measured by the cost of living index. If it is said that the lives of private education personnel are poor, please be patient for the sake of more students' parents. Every parent is equal to an old ox, and they really cannot bear the burden. Moreover, the treatment of private school teachers and staff should not differ too much from the treatment of municipal school teachers and staff, and a certain level should be maintained. Otherwise, all municipal school teachers and staff will want to run to private schools. Therefore, the principle of no increase should be adopted for private school fees this semester. Senator Jiang also said angrily: The cost of living index in the last semester was around 4,000 times, but the tuition standard for private schools was more than 8,000 times that before the war. Therefore, if you want to settle this account clearly, add interest to those who paid more last semester, and there is no need to pay tuition this semester.

Zhou Feicheng, Jiang Jizhou and others believed that the tuition standard was reasonable. Zhou said: The Education Committee passed this case very solemnly. The reason why the tuition fee increased this semester is only 15% of the last semester is because the tuition fee was set higher last semester, so the increase this semester is lower. According to the tuition standard this semester, the average monthly income of junior high school teachers is 420,000. Is it too high? Jiang Jizhou said: In the Education Bureau's budget, private schools cannot be fully subsidized, so tuition fees are used to subsidize the living expenses of teachers and staff. According to this calculation, the monthly income of elementary school teachers is more than 400,000, and the monthly income of middle school teachers is about 500,000. Can it be considered excessive?

### Not Enough Time, No Result

There were still many people who wanted to speak on this issue. Because there was not enough time, it was left to the General Assembly today to continue the discussion.

In addition, the General Assembly successfully passed two proposals related to education: (1) Please the Municipal Government immediately telegraph the Central Government to stop China Airlines from building houses on the abandoned site of Hongqiao Airport, and return the land to the city to build the Zhongzheng Cultural District. (2) In order to promote the New Life Movement and save the world and people's hearts, all neon light advertisements related to the New Life Movement should be opened without restrictions.

In addition, citizens suggested that measures be taken to stop unscrupulous soldiers from occupying civilian houses. The General Assembly decided yesterday that the Chairman of the National Government had already issued a handwritten instruction to stop unscrupulous soldiers from occupying civilian houses and that the Municipal Garrison Headquarters had already implemented it. This case is a citizen's proposal and should be sent to the Municipal Government to consult the competent authority for handling.

### Discussion of the Rotating Credit Association Issue: Just a War of Words

[Our Newspaper's Report] City Senators Zhuang Ping, Gu Jinzao and others said that the trend of rotating credit associations in the city is intensifying. This heavy profit exploitation, collecting funds from the public and lending them at high interest rates, is enough to disrupt finance. Since the giant rotating credit association case in Hankou occurred, the city's rotating credit association has been shaken. The harm to the citizens is the worst. If we do not take urgent measures to ban it strictly, its toxicity is worse than the character gambling. We specially submitted to the Senate, please the Municipal Government to strictly prohibit it, and issue a notice to persuade citizens to immediately stop the rotating credit association. The case was discussed at the General Assembly yesterday, and many people spoke. Zhong Yuliang said: The trend of rotating credit associations is becoming more and more popular in Pudong. Generally, women think it is profitable, so they secretly join the association without telling their mothers and husbands. Until recently, there have been many regular meetings, and disputes have arisen in the hall, so they have filed complaints with the police station. The police station believes that rotating credit associations are not illegal and are mutually voluntary, and the law does not have clear provisions to strictly prohibit them, so they do not care about this matter. However, gambling and prostitution are also mutually voluntary, so why should they be banned? But what about rotating credit associations? Finally, Zhong said with a smile: If the senators say that rotating credit associations are legal, then I would like to ask everyone to help me and also come and join. Hall Keeper Zhou continued to advocate that the case be retained and not discussed. The reason is that rotating credit associations are also a way of joining associations. Under China's special economic circumstances, rotating credit associations also help those who urgently need money. We only need to see whether their motives are good or not. The problem of defaulting on debts is another matter. The Speaker then put the two opinions to a vote, and the result was that the majority advocated that the case be retained and not discussed.

### Reduce Entertainment Tax, Change to 25% Excellent Drama, Reduce to 20% Again

[Our Newspaper's Report] The city's entertainment tax was passed by the City Senate's seventh meeting yesterday, according to the review opinions of the Finance Committee of the Senate, and will be levied from February 1st in accordance with the central government's regulations, reducing from 40% to 25%.

However, regarding the point in the review opinion that "the Finance Bureau should consider gradually reducing the drama tax rate," Zhang Zhongyuan and Qu Yue proposed that the number should be specified, and proposed that it be levied at 25%. However, Fei Shusheng expressed his objection, believing that drama is no different from other entertainment and should not be reduced, and should also be levied at 25%. Wang Weiliang said that drama was the most powerful propaganda work in the mainland during the Anti-Japanese War. In order to reward the drama industry that has made contributions to the Anti-Japanese War, it should be reduced to 20%. The Speaker put the three opinions of 25%, 20% and gradual reduction by the Municipal Government to a vote, but none of the results passed a majority, so the discussion could only continue. Deputy Speaker Xu Jiting said that drama has the highest cultural level among other dramas, but the business is the worst, and the tax should be reduced to 20%. Yang Fusheng advocated tax exemption. Mayor Wu immediately explained to the General Assembly: (1) Taxes are related to the people's burden, so it is best for the City Senate to decide. (2) Movie merchants give 50% of their income to film companies, so the burden is quite heavy. Peking Opera and movies are the same, but the cost of drama is high and the losses are large, so in the mainland, it was levied at 20%.

Speaker Pan then left the position of Chairman and expressed his opinion: Entertainment tax should be differentiated, such as dancing and movies. The cost of foreign movies is the lowest, so it is okay to charge more, but Peking Opera is different. The cost of hiring actors and various equipment is huge, so it is advocated that drama and Peking Opera should be reduced to 20%. According to the regulations of the Entertainment Tax Law, it can be graded. Tao Baichuan asked Speaker Pan to explain whether Shaoxing Opera can be reduced in tax. The Speaker said, "I'm sorry, I haven't seen it." (The whole audience laughed). Tao Baichuan then said: Tax collection should be absolutely fair. If drama and Peking Opera can be reduced, then local operas should also be reduced, so it is advocated that all reductions should be unified, otherwise it should not be graded.

Finally, Speaker Pan raised a practical question, saying: The general entertainment tax rate was originally 40%, and it will be reduced to 25%, which will reduce by 15%, while the original tax rate for drama was 30%. If it is reduced to 25%, it will only be reduced by 5%, which is too unfair. Li Wenjie also agreed with this point, and said that Peking Opera is very popular, and it is not necessary to reduce it to 25%. As a result, the General Assembly still passed the original review opinion, the entertainment tax is 25%, and the drama is 20%.

### Mounted Patrol Team Needs to Guarantee Public Security The General Assembly Decided to Retain It

[Our Newspaper's Report] At the last Senate meeting, it was decided to abolish the mounted patrol team of the Police Bureau and use the funds to expand the vehicle patrol team. The Municipal Government believes that the mounted patrol team is needed in fact, and specially submitted to this Senate for reconsideration, requesting to retain it to strengthen winter defense and benefit public security. When the Senate General Assembly discussed this case yesterday, the speeches were enthusiastic. Some advocated retaining it, and some advocated abolishing it. The reasons for advocating abolishing it are: the number of the mounted patrol team in this year's budget is 349 million, which is huge, and the last Senate has already decided to abolish it, so it should still be handled according to the original plan to maintain credibility. The reasons for advocating retaining it are: since the citizens have a burden, they must consider the safety of the citizens. The mounted patrol team is used to suppress emergency events, patrol the suburbs, and guarantee public security, which is really needed. Finally, it was put to a vote, and the majority voted to retain the mounted patrol team.

### The Private Fire Brigade Must Not Impose Donations by Force

In addition, a case was submitted to the Municipal Government to order the Shanghai South District Fire Brigade to cancel the collection of subsidies to reduce the burden on citizens in order to unify matters and make them fair. The General Assembly decided on the following measures: 1. In consideration of the facts, the private fire brigades in various districts of the city should be retained. 2. Under the principle of private operation and private supervision, the Police Bureau should formulate management methods, reward and punishment assessment methods, and command systems. 3. The budget listed by the Police Bureau for taking over the private fire brigade in the 36th year should be removed. 4. If there are donations from private fire brigades in various districts, they must be voluntarily donated by the people and must not be forcibly apportioned. They must comply with the unified donation method for people's organizations promulgated by the government.

### Crack Down on Local Thugs' Extortion

The General Assembly also passed many proposals related to police administration yesterday: (1) Please the Municipal Government to instruct the city's Police Bureau to improve the handling of vehicles that cause trouble in the future (2) Please the Police Bureau to strictly crack down on and prevent extortion cases by local thugs. (3) Please crack down on pickpockets and theater ticket scalpers.

The Discussion on the Standard for House Rent Has a Result Passed the Extension of the Unified Lease Case Original Residents Are Still Allowed to Continue Renting

[Our Newspaper's Report] When the Senate discussed the proposals related to land administration yesterday, a fierce debate was caused over the case of "Please the Municipal Government to maintain the first resolution of the Senate, clearly ordering all landlords not to increase rents casually to maintain the livelihood of the common people, and the landlords must not refuse to deduct the house donation part, please make a public decision and send it to the Municipal Government for strict implementation." The measures proposed in the proposal are (1) Please the Municipal Government to immediately order the landlords to maintain the original rent price stipulated in April of the 35th year (2) For litigation cases where the house lease contract expires and the tenant refuses to increase the rent, and the landlord forces the tenant to move out, please the Municipal Government not to accept the Shanghai Land Court (3) Please the Municipal Government to make a public announcement that the rent increase after April of the 35th year without the consent of the tenant is invalid, and the tenant is allowed to deduct it from the rent payable in the next period. 4. If there is a need to increase the rent, the Municipal Government Senate landlord representatives, together with relevant agencies and groups, should jointly agree on a fair price, so that landlords and tenants can jointly abide by it. 5. The house donation part should be requested by the government to announce the measures decided by the first Senate meeting, so that landlords cannot refuse to deduct it in order to maintain the government's credibility. Some senators advocated retaining the case and not discussing it. Some senators believed that the matter was of great importance, and disputes caused by rent are emerging one after another. Therefore, the Senate should have a decision to seek a thorough solution. If there are no hard and fast rules, at least the principles should be decided and sent to the government for reference. Speaker Pan first put the two opinions of advocating retaining the case and opposing retaining it to a vote. As a result, a minority supported retaining it, so the discussion began on how to stipulate the rent and other points. Senator Shao Yongsheng proposed that the Speaker of this meeting and three senators should convene relevant groups to jointly discuss and decide on the rent standard. After the decision, if the stipulated standard is not followed, effective sanctions will be imposed. As a result, due to insufficient time, the discussion was not continued, and the case was still pending and had not been discussed.

The General Assembly then passed three proposals related to land administration (1) In order to extend the unified lease method and prevent the demobilized military, public and teaching personnel who came to Shanghai from being displaced, the original residents of military, public and teaching personnel and cultural organizations who have been legally allocated and have no rent arrears shall continue to rent. If the original owner refuses to sign a lease contract for any reason, and should sign a contract immediately. (2) Please the Municipal Government to designate the housing for the city's high and two courts in accordance with the resolution of the first General Assembly of this Senate so that they can relocate their offices. (3) Please the Municipal Government to stipulate the profit of the intermediate lease by the second landlord in order to reduce the burden on the third tenant and send it to the Municipal Government for reference.

### The Zhonghua New Village Case Has Been Resolved Zhang Yaming and Hou Junren Shake Hands at the General Assembly to Release Suspicions

[Our Newspaper's Report] A few days ago, the City Senate, based on the temporary motion of Senators Hou Junren and Lu Huiming, expressed its opinion on the dispute between Zhang Yaming, inspector of the Garrison Headquarters, and the No. 12 District Office of No. 12 Zhonghua New Village, Xinzha Road, and Senator Lu's Huimin housing. Yesterday morning, Zhang Yaming went to the City Senate to meet the Mayor, claiming that he had obtained the custody certificate of the enemy and puppet property processing bureau for the house and had paid the rent for August, so it was actually legal. Regarding the matter of Senator Lu, Lu had already sent a letter to Speaker Pan and withdrew it automatically, so he did not talk about it. However, he made three requests to Hou Junren and the No. 12 District Office: (1) The District Office can temporarily work there, but there is a time limit. (2) The family members of the District Office staff must move out. (3) Hou Junren should express his opinion. Mayor Wu replied to Zhang that he would discuss with Director Zhang Xiaosong of the Political Office and Senator Hou to mediate. Regarding Zhang's request, Mayor Wu said that he would find another office address for the District Office and move out from there. For the point that the family members of the staff should move out, because it is not easy to find a house at present, a time limit should be given, and there is no need to talk about other things. Zhang and Hou shook hands to release their suspicions under the mediation of Mayor Wu and Director Zhang. In addition, Zhang Yaming asked whether he could withdraw the point passed by the Senate a few days ago regarding the case. Mayor Wu said that he could detail the process and send a letter to the Senate. In the afternoon, Speaker Pan reported to the General Assembly that Senator Lu's residence had been restored to its original state, and the District Office had also been restored to its original state. The right to lease the house is another legal issue. The parties concerned have reached a reconciliation through negotiation.

### Many Year-End Bonus Disputes

Hotel Employees Go to the Social Bureau New Great Factory Enters the Factory

Hotel industry employees have been requesting year-end bonuses for a long time. The Social Bureau previously stated that there was no precedent for year-end bonuses and that the two parties should negotiate on their own. It is said that a small part has had results, but most of them have failed to reach an agreement. Yesterday morning, about 500 to 600 members of the industry's workers' union went to the Social Bureau to petition. After persuasion from the Social Bureau, it was said that there was no explicit provision for year-end bonuses, and there was no precedent in the travel industry. However, in order to promote labor-capital relations, the capital can issue it according to the circumstances, and it is not impossible. It is still hoped that labor and capital can understand each other and cannot have any prejudices, but they must abide by the legal procedures. In addition, Zhan Huizhong Hotel, which went on strike the day before, has returned to normal after the Social Bureau sent personnel to guide it yesterday.

[Another News] The New Great Weaving Factory entrusted Yu Jida Accountant to liquidate it due to a loss of nearly 1 billion yuan. Regarding the year-end bonus for the workers, it applied to the Social Bureau for exemption. Yesterday, about 70 to 80 workers from the factory went to Yu Accountant's office on Jiujiang Road to negotiate. After the Social Bureau sent personnel to mediate, they first dispersed and waited for a legal solution.

### It Was Decided That Banquet Donations Should Not Be Graded, but Should Be Levied at 15% Across the Board

[Our Newspaper's Report] Regarding the grading problem of the banquet tax, the City Senate discussed it for a long time at the General Assembly the day before yesterday without any results. Yesterday morning, the Senate continued to discuss the case. Finally, according to the proposal of Senator Jiang Pingfan, a solution was found, that is, for banquets whose price per unit exceeds the starting tax point of 5,000 yuan, regardless of Chinese or Western dishes, a banquet tax of 15% will be levied across the board from February 1st of this year. Senator Jiang Pu explained: The Municipal Government's implementation of the method of dividing into A and B grades conflicts with the central government's laws and regulations. At the same time, people in the Chinese and Western food industries have expressed dissatisfaction with the high tax rate. However, before deciding on this proposal, I and other senators also considered the legal issues and studied it for two hours. As a result, although we still cannot find a method that satisfies all parties, it is also impossible to fully comply with the central government's laws and regulations, but we hope that the Municipal Government's Finance Bureau and the people will cooperate. All laws are man-made and can be amended and submitted to the central government for record. The central government stipulates that "a banquet with a certain price per table" can be levied with a banquet tax, in which the word "table" seems inappropriate. If Western dishes are counted by the guest, they cannot be called a table. Therefore, for the sake of fairness, it is changed to "unit." In addition, there is no such tax in the central government's new tax law for dim sum, but he advocated that dim sum must also be levied, because it would be extremely unfair to invite 500 guests to dim sum at the Kang Le Restaurant and exempt them from tax.

Deputy Speaker Xu Jiting had advocated grading at the General Assembly the day before yesterday, but after discussing with other senators, he believed that it was wrong and formally declared that he would withdraw his original opinion. Senator Xu Yongzuo also seconded the original proposal and provided an explanation of the legal issues, saying: Articles 109 and 110 of the Constitution stipulate that the finances and taxes of provinces, cities, and counties can be determined by the provinces, cities, and counties themselves. Therefore, there is a legal basis for requesting the central government to amend it.

The above amendment was passed by a majority vote at the General Assembly.

Those With Dancing Facilities Are Still Levied 25%

As for the tax collection problem of restaurants with dancing facilities, it was also submitted to the General Assembly for discussion. Director of the Finance Bureau Gu Chunfan added that the current method is that for restaurants with dancing facilities, the banquet tax is levied according to the entertainment tax. However, if the dancing time is less than half of the business hours, the average of the entertainment tax and the banquet tax is levied. Those with only music and no dancing are not included in this case. As a result, the General Assembly passed a 25% levy.

The Senate also resolved other financial proposals, including: (1) Since the municipal ferry has been turned over to commercial operations, it should be taxed according to regulations to enrich the city treasury. (2) In order to alleviate the poverty of the people in the suburbs, it is proposed to exempt small houses, peddlers, and other donations. After the General Assembly decided, both were sent to the Municipal Government to handle them in consideration of the economic situation of the people in the suburbs and the tax revenue of the Municipal Government. (3) The collection of municipal construction donations for the 36th year was decided to be temporarily retained and discussed again when necessary after the budget revenue and expenditure are determined. 4 Regarding the proposal to stop the grain household registration, it was temporarily retained because the Finance Bureau had completed two-thirds of the grain household work, so it seemed appropriate to continue to complete it.

### The Municipal Government Handles the Hotel Industry Year-End Bonus Dispute Impartially

The Joint Association of Civilian Households in Wusong Who Were Requisitioned for the Shipyard Petition for Adjustment

[Our Newspaper's Report] Recently, a few hotels have implemented "treating guests" because the year-end bonus problem has not been resolved, and they only collect small bills and hotel donations from tourists without collecting room fees. Yesterday afternoon, the Hotel Industry Association sent representatives to the City Senate to petition, requesting the Mayor to effectively stop it. The General Assembly sent Senator Yan Pingsheng to meet them and reported the process to the General Assembly by Speaker Pan. Mayor Wu said that he would never oppress or exploit workers, but there could be no strikes or slowdowns during the mediation period. Therefore, he hoped that the Senate could support the Municipal Government, and the Municipal Government would handle it in accordance with the law. Because the workers are hired by the hotel owners, the workers are not collecting room fees, so they are being prosecuted in court for the crime of encroaching on other people's property and hindering other people's interests. Chen Baotai said: Comparing workers with public education personnel, workers have been treated too preferentially, so he supports the Municipal Government's measures, otherwise civil servants will also ask for year-end bonuses, what should we do? Lu Yinchu hoped that it would be handled impartially and not protect the capital side. Tao Baichuan said: Since the Municipal Government has already expressed its attitude, this Senate does not need to discuss it now. After the decision, it was transferred to the Municipal Government to handle it fairly in accordance with the law.

The Provisional Joint Association of Civilian Households in Wusong, who were requisitioned by the Central Shipyard, also petitioned the Senate yesterday, requesting: (1) The land valuation is unfair and should be reasonably adjusted. (2) The price of houses and land should be higher than that of ordinary farmland. (3) The compensation for improvements and relocation fees should be adjusted again. (4) After the land and houses are requisitioned, the occupation will become a problem. Please find a way to provide relief. (5) Designate areas for shantytowns to relocate to.

### Maintain Peddlers' Livelihood Consider Designating Stalls

[Our Newspaper's Report] Regarding the case of requesting the Municipal Government to designate stall locations as soon as possible, the Senate General Assembly decided yesterday that in order to take into account the lives of the common people, they should be allowed to set up stalls in areas that do not hinder traffic. The areas where stalls are not allowed to be set up will be decided by the Senate's Police and Public Affairs Committees in conjunction with the Police Bureau after on-site inspections in various districts.

In addition, in order to improve police treatment, improve police quality, and eliminate bad habits, the General Assembly yesterday temporarily decided not to discuss it because it involved budget issues.

### The French Tram Strike Reaches a Settlement and Signs Minutes

[Our Newspaper's Report] The French Tram strike reached a settlement yesterday afternoon under the mediation of the Social Bureau, and the labor and management sides signed the minutes of the settlement. The labor side was represented by Yang Jingen and other eight representatives of the French Water and Electricity Company Industry Union, who first stated to Zhao Banfu, Director of the Labor Department of the Social Bureau, that the labor side requested the company to amend its articles of association, and the capital side insisted that ticket seller No. 305 stop working. After several discussions, Director Zhao ruled: (1) No. 305 will be suspended for three months, and will be transferred to work at the labor union during the suspension period. (2) Regarding the amendment of the articles of association, the labor side can submit specific opinions within a short period of time and discuss them with the Public Utilities and Social Bureaus. (3) The capital side will waive all losses during the slowdown period. After both parties agreed, the minutes were signed and filed. So far, the slowdown problem has been temporarily resolved.

### Four Culprits in the Robbery Case on Qipu Road Have Been Arrested One After Another

[Report from our Newspaper] On the afternoon of the sixth day of the month, three bandits broke into the home of Zheng Suju at No. 19 Yixing Lane, Qipu Road. Two of them were armed with guns and threatened them not to make any noise. A gold bar, two pairs of gold bracelets, a gold watch, and 350,000 yuan in cash were robbed and they fled. Afterwards, the victim reported to the North Railway Station Branch based on information. When the three bandits knocked on the door, they shouted "Zhong Bing" several times (referring to Zheng Zhongbing, the younger brother of the victim). Based on this clue, Zhongbing was summoned to the station and asked if there were any suspicious people among his friends. Zhongbing recalled that a friend named Zhang Hengzhong (living at No. 117 Shanhai Pass Road) had exchanged a coat with him last month, but had not returned it. Therefore, the police were dispatched to Zhang's home with him, but Zhang was out and not there, so his wife was interviewed. At the same time, they caught a glimpse of heads moving inside the room, which was very suspicious. A few days later, Section Chief Ding of the branch ordered female police officer Liu Changhua to dress as a northern woman and go again with him. Zhang Hengzhong was indeed at home that day. The two sides talked about the exchange of coats, saying that it had been robbed by bandits and would be taken care of later, and then they said goodbye. However, female police officer Liu Changhua had recognized Zhang Hengzhong, so Liu Changhua was responsible for investigating his actions and reporting to her superiors at any time. As a result, it was believed that Zhang Hengzhong was related to the robbery case. On the afternoon of the tenth, Liu followed Zhang to the Vienna Ballroom and saw him whispering with his friend Zhang Chengxun. Believing that the opportunity was ripe, she secretly reported to Section Chief Ding of the branch and ordered the police to go. Zhang Hengzhong and Zhang Chengxun were arrested and taken to the station for interrogation. They denied participating in the Zheng family's robbery case, but admitted that they had told them that the Zheng family was rich. Finally, they confessed that the main culprit was Yang Kunlong and the accomplices were Liu Xindi and a person named Wen Kui. The police were immediately dispatched to Zhapu Road to arrest the suspects Yang Kunlong and Liu Xindi together, and seized a Browning pistol and fourteen bullets. Later, they went to Wen Kui's residence on Dongchang Road to arrest him, but he had already fled after hearing the news.

### Four Suicides Occurred

### Qian Daqun's Trial Concluded, Sentencing Scheduled for the 20th. Crimes Should Be Equated with Those of Zhou Fohai, and Other, Supervisory Officials Request Heavier Punishment.

[Report from our Newspaper] Qian Daqun, the former Deputy Governor of the Puppet Central Reserve Bank, concluded his trial at the High Court yesterday, and the sentencing is scheduled for 9:30 AM on the 20th of this month.

The defendant was originally the manager of the Dalian branch of Jin Cheng Bank and was well acquainted with Zhou Fohai. When Wang Jingwei and Zhou Fohai came to Shanghai from Chongqing to organize the puppet Nanjing government, Qian also arrived in Shanghai from Dalian and organized the puppet Central Reserve Bank with Zhou. In the thirty-first year, the bank was established, and Qian served as the deputy governor and director, and also served as the manager of the bank's Shanghai branch. He had indiscriminately issued puppet currency, devalued the value of legal tender, recklessly granted loans, disrupted finance, and lent a large amount of puppet currency to the enemy's Zhengjin Bank to enrich the enemy's resources in order to purchase materials.

Qian was short and stout, with a dark complexion. He wore a dark blue silk cotton robe, leggings, and black leather shoes. His hands drooped, and he looked quite respectful. When answering, his eyes looked down, and he babbled like an elementary school student practicing a speech.

The defendant argued against the charges in the indictment, stating that the law should be based on facts and should examine the reasons and motives for the defendant's participation in the puppet organization. Because Zhou Fohai claimed to have relations with the central government, it was still the Three Principles of the People and the Blue Sky White Sun flag, and the issuance of puppet Central Reserve notes was to overthrow military tickets. The defendant did not understand the truth and was deceived.

Zhou Fohai was in charge of the puppet Central Reserve Bank internally and externally, and the deputy governor was just a staff member. When the defendant was the manager of the Shanghai branch in the thirtieth year, because the Japanese had coveted the removal of currency, he bought gold with legal tender as the reserve of the puppet Central Reserve Bank, which was resented by the Japanese. In the thirty-first year, he resigned from the position of manager of the Shanghai branch. The exchange of legal tender and the issuance of puppet currency were decided by the puppet Nanjing government and handled under the order of the puppet Ministry of Finance. The enemy's Zhengjin Bank borrowed money from the puppet Central Reserve Bank to purchase materials. The contract was signed by Zhou Fohai and the enemy, and the defendant did not participate. After the victory, the puppet Central Reserve Bank handed over 53,900 gold bars, more than 7.6 million taels of silver, as well as US dollars and real estate. The puppet Central Reserve notes issued a total of 3.8 trillion. To this end, the court transferred the files related to Qian Daqun from the puppet Central Reserve Bank in the capital for the defendant to read. The defendant said that they all existed, but at that time, he was often in Shanghai, and these official documents were all issued from Nanjing, and a rubber stamp was usually stamped. The defendant did not know some things at all.

Then, Prosecutor Dai Rongduo stood up and said that the defendant served in the puppet government, colluded with the enemy country, and conspired to resist his own country. His crimes were obvious, and he had confessed in his written confession and previous statements. The important documents of the puppet Central Reserve Bank were jointly signed by Zhou Fohai and the defendant, and his crimes should be equated with those of Zhou Fohai. He requested the court to impose heavier penalties in accordance with Articles 2, 1, 2, 6, and 10 of the Regulations on Punishing Traitors. Finally, the defendant's lawyers Lu Shaokang and Zhu Hongru stood up to defend the defendant and presented two newspaper clippings to the court. The court ordered the debate to end and scheduled the sentencing for the 20th. The defendant was taken back into custody after meeting with his family.

### Deputy Director of the Wharves Department of the China Merchants Bureau Suspected of Abuse of Power and Embezzlement. After an Investigation by Assigned Personnel, He Was First Dismissed from His Position, and the Entire Case Was Sent to the District Prosecutor's Office for Investigation.

[Report from our Newspaper] Li Yunsheng, the former deputy director of the Wharves Department of the state-owned China Merchants Bureau, was recently reported by Ren Huchen, the general manager of the Renji Cargo Transportation and Loading and Unloading Company, and Fan Shutang, the foreman, to the bureau for abuse of power and misconduct, such as employing private individuals and engaging in self-enrichment. After the China Merchants Bureau assigned senior staff members Yang Jinglun, Chen Wenxuan, Shen Daowu, and Shi Renchong to investigate, although the points reported by Ren Huchen and others were not entirely true, there were also some doubts. After detailed information, the China Merchants Bureau reported to the Ministry of Communications, which ordered the entire case to be transferred to the court for investigation. The case has been sent to the District Prosecutor's Office a few days ago, and the handling prosecutor is preparing to summon Li Yunsheng and other related persons within today or tomorrow. According to the confidential letters from Ren Huchen and others, the loading and unloading of Pudong Riqing Wharf was originally contracted by Li Zhongcang. However, Li had been suspected of collaborating with the enemy during the period when the city was occupied, so after the victory and restoration, the cargo transportation of the wharf was operated by Renji Company. After continuing for a year, the wharf was leased by the China Merchants Bureau and renamed "China Merchants Bureau's Ninth Wharf." During this transition period, Li Zhongcang took the opportunity to bribe and collude with Li Yunsheng, changed Ma Wenqi to the supervisor, and stole the newly made worker porcelain brand armbands of the China Merchants Bureau, distributed them to the former workers of Li Zhongcang, and gathered crowds to come and grab them, almost causing a bloody tragedy. He also cited examples to describe the corruption of porters and small workers at the wharf. He also claimed that Li Yunsheng and Ma Wenqi and others agreed to split 30% of the income each month. According to the investigation results of Yang Jinglun and other four people, it was learned that the workers currently under Ma Wenqi were indeed the old department of Li Zhongcang, and there was no other evidence. However, they claimed that porters and small workers at the wharf had always had many problems, and Li Yunsheng, as the person in charge, also兼introduced, but did not add 的束, although there was no evidence of joint corruption, it was not without suspicion, especially Li Yunsheng's excuse that Ma Wenqi was introduced by Wu Shaoshu, but could not provide a letter to prove it, which was obviously false. Moreover, it was said that the China Merchants Bureau directly managed a total of four wharves in Shanghai, and the number of supervisors recommended by Li had reached as many as three. It is heard that Li Yunsheng was dismissed from his position after the case occurred. If the above-mentioned abuse of power is found to be true after investigation, the District Prosecutor's Office will file a public prosecution on the charge of corruption.

### Another Miracle After Wang Didi's: An Infant in Swaddling Clothes Fell from the Plane Unharmed; A Country Woman Had No Children and Heaven Sent Her a Son

[Report from our Newspaper] This newspaper received a letter from a reader named "Chou Hai" yesterday, which stated: "On Christmas night last year, the China Aviation Company's Flight No. 115, which crashed near the Heta Temple on the third bridge of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway, was once considered a miracle because four-year-old Wang Didi was found unharmed under the fuselage. Who would have known that another infant in swaddling clothes was hit between the tree branches when the plane crashed, and was also unharmed. A nearby country woman was the first to discover him and took him home to raise him. At that time, the child's body felt a little cold, but after warming and feeding him, he showed no signs of fright, and he was fair and beautiful, very different from the children in the countryside. The woman was middle-aged and had no children, and the couple was overjoyed to have him. It was truly a heaven-sent son. However, after this news spread, the nearby neighbors came to watch for a while. The woman was deeply afraid that he would be claimed, so she took the child to a relative's house to avoid him temporarily. I wonder if the child can return to his relatives' arms like Wang Didi?" The truth remains to be verified.

### Yang Jianzhong, Commissioner of the Enemy Property Disposal Bureau, Was Sued and Awaits Sentencing

[Report from our Newspaper] Car broker Li Yunting recently filed a complaint with the District Court against Yang Jianzhong, the former commissioner of the Enemy and Puppet Industry Disposal Bureau. It is said that he had a 1941 Ford car, which was entrusted to Hezhong Automobile Company for repair in April of the 34th year. Yang learned about it and went to investigate. Based on the engine number, he believed that the car belonged to the enemy, so he confiscated it; but he told the car company to tell Li to come to discuss it. Li then arranged with Zhu Chengxun of Xinhua Car Company to go to the Huizhong Hotel to negotiate with Yang, and Yang asked for three gold bars. Because he had no gold to redeem, it was not resolved. On August 22 of the same year, Li went to inquire again and asked for it to be returned. Yang called him a rogue and reported it to the police, who arrested Li. After the police interrogated him and understood the situation, he was released. Li then filed a lawsuit with the District Court and filed an ancillary civil suit, demanding compensation of 600,000 yuan per month from the 24th of the 35th year until the end of the execution. The case was opened by Judge Wang Jiazhuo at 2:00 PM yesterday. The defendant, Yang Jianzhong, denied ever asking for the gold bars. He claimed that the car was enemy property and was obtained through secret reports and investigation. The court ordered that the case be sentenced on the 20th.

### The Truth About the Corruption at the Zhenru Machinery Plant Under the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (RRA) – Careless Packaging Tempted Managers to Embezzle and Sell Goods; Inevitably They Were Caught in the Legal Net

[Our Own Dispatch] The RRA authorities recently announced the dissolution of the Zhenru Machinery Repair Factory, primarily due to the embezzlement of materials by senior staff at the plant. This massive corruption case is currently under investigation by the judiciary. Our reporter has gathered information and will now provide a comprehensive report on the events leading up to this situation:

The occurrence of corruption often arises in relatively chaotic situations, with the "fishing in troubled waters" approach being the most common. Objective conditions also contributed to the embezzlement of materials by Zhenru Machinery Plant staff. The materials obtained by the RRA were partly surplus supplies from the U.S. military. When these surplus materials were shipped to China, the packaging was extremely disorganized, and there were no records of the product names. Often, various items were mixed together in one package, in varying quantities, making it impossible to understand the contents without individually counting each item. This state of chaos inevitably presented a great temptation to the management personnel. Deputy Factory Director Heath and other senior staff took advantage of their positions to embezzle and sell goods for personal gain. They may have believed that there were no accurate counts of the materials, so they would be safe from getting caught, but they did not expect that this would ultimately lead them into the legal net.

Early Rumors Led to Surveillance

The RRA authorities had heard rumors of the embezzlement of materials for some time, but they lacked evidence to take action. Heath was originally the factory director. To monitor his actions and prevent further corruption, the RRA reassigned Yuan Shenduo as factory director and made Heath his deputy. However, Yuan was outnumbered and lacked the power to do anything, and the embezzlement continued unabated. In early December, to find a fundamental solution, the authorities established an Industrial and Mining Materials Group under the Shanghai Storage and Transportation Bureau, with Bi Gaokui as its director. Bi had previously worked for the Sino-American Cooperative Organization, and the RRA’s appointment of Bi as director was of great significance.

After the establishment of the Industrial and Mining Materials Group, the machinery and material parts of the Zhenru Machinery Plant were transferred to the group, and the plant was then only responsible for the technical training of personnel. However, Heath and others believed that the new personnel were still unfamiliar with the situation, so they planned a final large-scale sale of aluminum sheets and timber. This happened a few days after Bi Gaokui took office. Bi's subordinates tracked the trucks transporting the goods, recorded their license plate numbers, and investigated their owners, and the embezzlement was exposed.

### Communist Army Captain in Northern Jiangsu Arrested in Shanghai for Murder and Extortion; Sun Rongwen Interrogated by the District Court Yesterday

[Our Own Dispatch] Sun Rongwen, the "militia captain" of the Communist army in Qitao Township, Funing, northern Jiangsu, fled to Shanghai because he was not tolerated by the "New Fourth Army." During his time as "captain" in Funing, Sun committed murder, extortion, and unlawful detention, committing all kinds of evil deeds. After arriving in Shanghai, the victims reported him to the North Sichuan Road Police Station, which arrested him and handed him over to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters, who then transferred him to the High Procuratorate. The prosecutor indicted him for endangering the Republic of China, and the remaining charges were transferred to the District Court for trial. Yesterday, Judge Zhu Yuhuang of the Ninth Criminal Court held a hearing. The facts of his crimes are as follows: (1) In 1943, the victim Chen Yonghua was imprisoned twice in a row because he refused Sun’s order to join the Communist army. (2) Cloth merchant Shen Zhaolong was angered by Sun’s request to purchase twelve feet of cloth on credit. He was forced to guard the door at night and donate one dou of rice and ten catties of pork. In July 1945, Sun sent a Communist guerrilla team to extort 3,000 yuan from Shen. Because Shen had no money, Sun accused him of hiding weapons from the puppet "Peace Army" and arrested him. (3) In 1945, Sun forced his fellow villager Wu Fazhen to join the "militia." Because Wu refused, Sun went to his house to arrest him. Wu received the news in advance and escaped. Sun and others then took their anger out on Wu's wife, hitting her lower abdomen with the butt of a gun. Wu's wife was four months pregnant and suffered a miscarriage due to the injury, which led to her death. After Wu fled to Shanghai, his family's property was looted. (4) Sun forced Zhang Yicheng to join the "militia." Zhang also received the news in advance and escaped. Sun took his anger out on Zhang's aunt and uncle, Sun Fengzhang, forcing him to donate eleven wooden-shell guns and one Browning pistol. Because he could not pay, he was brutally murdered. Yesterday in court, Sun admitted to being a Communist army "militia captain," but he denied all charges of murder, extortion, and unlawful detention. The court adjourned the hearing to a later date, stating that more evidence was needed.

### More Than a Dozen Thefts; Losses of 3 Billion

This final batch of embezzled materials was worth over 100 million yuan. Before this, there had been no fewer than a dozen thefts, so it is generally estimated that the total value of the corruption is over 1 billion yuan, while according to rumors among lower-level staff at the plant, the total value is as high as 3 billion yuan. The RRA authorities have now ordered an investigation of the receipt and payment of materials and a comparison with the inventory.

The Chinese staff involved in this case will be prosecuted under the Regulations on Corruption by Public Officials. As for the foreign technicians, it is said that the Australian government has consulted with the relevant authorities here, requesting that they be prosecuted for embezzlement in consideration of their past contributions. This request may be granted. (The penalty for corruption is at least seven years in prison, while the penalty for embezzlement is a few months for minor offenses, and a fine may be substituted).

### A Tragic Interlude: Vehicles Collide

Related to this corruption case is a tragic interlude: several months ago, near the Zhenru Railway at midnight one night, an RRA truck full of dozens of workers collided with a train, resulting in many deaths and injuries. It is understood that this truck that set out late at night was transporting embezzled materials.

The RRA authorities have now officially ordered the dissolution of the Zhenru Machinery Plant. In fact, the plant was already nominally defunct when the Industrial and Mining Materials Group of the Shanghai Storage and Transportation Bureau was established in early December. The authorities' decision to dissolve the plant was not solely due to corruption. It is understood that the RRA's budget for this year has a large deficit, so it is urgently seeking to increase revenue and reduce expenditure. The Zhenru Machinery Plant's performance over the past year has been dismal, and it requires a monthly subsidy of over 500 million yuan, so even if there had been no embezzlement, its existence would not have lasted long. The plant has nearly 200 employees, most of whom will be laid off with compensation at the end of this month.

### A Treacherous Classmate Stabs Throat with Knife

[Our Own Dispatch] At about 9 o'clock last night, a robbery and assault occurred at the intersection of Huangpi South Road and Xingye Road. Lu Baoquan (18 years old) from Dongtai, residing at No. 169 Xingye Road, had a former classmate, Ke Zhenqing (16 years old, residing at No. 169 Lane, same road), whom he had known for years. Last night, they met on the street, and Lu insisted on inviting Ke to visit a friend on Xujiahui Road. They did not find the friend and were returning when, at the intersection of Huangpi South Road and Xingye Road in a dark alley, Lu, claiming to be looking for No. 12, took out a kitchen knife and stabbed Ke in the throat while Ke was looking up. Blood flowed profusely. Lu then robbed Ke of two "luminous swimming watch" worn on his left wrist, then fled the scene. At this time, Officer Ma from the Taishan Branch was patrolling and noticed the injured person chasing after him. He went forward to inquire, and Lu claimed that someone had robbed him of his watch at gunpoint. He then took the opportunity to throw the two watches into the desolate foreign cemetery. Officer Ma recovered one watch and a kitchen knife and brought the suspect to the station. The injured person was rushed to the Ellysee Hospital for treatment. It is reported that the trachea was not severed, and the hospital is giving emergency treatment. The details of the case are being investigated by the police.

It is said that the trial will begin within days.

### Director of the Conscription Bureau Xu Siping Visited Mayor Wu and Others Yesterday to Discuss Conscription Steps in Shanghai; Detailed Discussion of Military Service Laws with Reporters

Xu Siping, Director of the Conscription Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense, departed from Nanjing on the 4th of this month to inspect military service administration in the southeastern provinces, passing through Zhenjiang, Yangzhou, Hangzhou, and other places. He arrived in Shanghai yesterday and met with Mayor Wu and Chuan Zhengmo, the first commander of the Shanghai Garrison District, to discuss conscription steps in Shanghai. He is scheduled to leave Shanghai for South China today. A reporter from the Central News Agency noted that the Garrison District in this area had just been established, and citizens were not fully aware of the military service laws. In particular, there were many misperceptions regarding the age and number of draftees, as well as the circumstances of enlistment. Therefore, the reporter visited Director Xu at his residence yesterday and inquired in detail about the handling of military administration. Details are as follows:

Xu first stated that after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the number of people conscripted for military service was far less than during the war. The military service administration structure had also been reduced in size, with the Military Service Department of the Ministry of Military Affairs being reorganized into the Military Service Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense. The number of staff had also been reduced from thousands to over three hundred. Given that the Military Service Law of 1943 was created during wartime and had many shortcomings, such as overly broad exemptions and deferments, which caused dissatisfaction among public servants and intellectuals who were not serving in the military, thus undermining the principle of equal military service obligations, he was ordered to draft military service laws. The draft was revised seven times and was officially promulgated on October 10 of last year. There are a total of sixty garrison districts in the country, of which fifty-six have been established successively. The remaining four districts in the border areas have not yet been established.

Regarding the age and types of military service, Xu also explained in detail, dividing them into three categories: regular military service, supplementary military service, and national military service.

Enlistment Begins at Age 20; Discharge at Age 45

The age for active service is the year following the year a man turns twenty, starting on January 1. After passing the conscription examination, he will be drafted into the military for a period of two years. Director Xu stated that the results of his visit to Mayor Wu showed that according to current household registration statistics, the number of people in this city of conscription age (i.e., those who have turned 20) accounts for no more than 1% of the total population. Among this 1% of men of conscription age, after deducting those who are deferred or exempt, a lottery will be held for enlistment. If the unit is a bao, the ratio of those drafted is less than one in a thousand. This is because the average number of people per bao in this city is about 3,000, and only one or two people are drafted. Those who are drafted and are high school graduates or above will serve for one year, while special forces and elite soldiers will serve for one year and six months. In addition to those in active service, there are also reservists, who are those who have completed their active service and have been discharged. They serve until they reach the age of 45. In addition, there are two other types of military service: supplementary military service and national military service. The former depends on the needs of national defense, with a training period of four to six months. After the training period, they are discharged. The latter is purely national military training, which aims to instill military knowledge and train the body. In terms of types of military service, they are divided into three categories: officer service, sergeant service, and enlisted soldier service. Currently, many people who are unaware of the laws often mistakenly believe that being drafted is the same as being an enlisted soldier, which is a major error.

Those of Age Must Serve; No Deferment or Exemption Based on Occupation

Regarding exemptions, deferments, and women's military service, Director Xu stated that the Military Service Law clearly stipulates the types of exemptions and deferments. One cannot be exempted or deferred simply because of a certain status or occupation. People only need to understand one point, that the age for military service begins on January 1 of the year following the year a man turns twenty. In other words, at this age, those who are selected in the lottery must enlist, which is the responsibility and obligation of every citizen. After two years, they will be discharged. The Military Service Law stipulates the following exemptions and deferments: (1) Those who are physically deformed or disabled, or have chronic illnesses that make them unable to serve, are exempt from military service. (Military Service Law, Article 4) (2) Those who have been sentenced to imprisonment of seven years or more are prohibited from military service. (Article 5) (3) Men of active service age who have one of the following circumstances may postpone conscription, which is called deferment: A. Those who are going abroad on official business; B. Students in high school or above who have not yet graduated; C. Those who are accused of a crime for which the most severe penalty is imprisonment of more than one year and are under prosecution. When the reason for deferment in the third category disappears, they will still be subject to conscription. Students in the second category will be drafted into the military after graduation and complete reserve officer training (Article 24). The Military Service Law also states that women of conscription age (same as men) may, at their own request, receive appropriate military auxiliary service education during peacetime, and may be conscripted to perform military auxiliary service during wartime. Xu stated that the southeastern provinces have been occupied for a long time, and military administration needs to be strengthened. During his inspection, he will exchange opinions with the governors of the provinces and the mayors of the cities to establish military administration structures quickly and include them in the local budget. Even more important is assistance in registering births, controlling movement, and issuing identity cards, so that the military service laws can be widely publicized and known to every household, so as to reduce various difficulties during the enlistment period. This situation is even more important in Shanghai, and the publicity from the media is relied upon.

Corruption Has Mostly Been Eliminated; Treatment Has Also Been Improved

Xu stated that military administration in various places has made obvious progress compared to the wartime period. During the Anti-Japanese War, many enlisted soldiers were ill, and the mortality rate was high, which is one reason. There were frequent desertions among enlisted soldiers, which is another reason. In the past, because there were too many desertions, supervision was very strict, and freedom of movement was restricted, which is another reason. Xu's inspection results showed that most of the past abuses have been eliminated, and treatment has been improved. Enlisted soldiers in Hangzhou and other places can also ask for leave to go out for business. The reporter asked if Xu had received any complaints from the public in various places about abuses in local military administration during his inspection. Xu said that his trip from Nanjing was short, and he had not yet received any complaints. However, the Military Service Bureau itself had received such complaints, which were of two types: one was that township chiefs were implementing family separation and allocating funds to buy soldiers for enlistment, and the other was that drafted soldiers were hiring people to replace them. Both have been investigated separately and strictly prohibited.

### Reader Consultation: Legal Questions

(1) Requesting a Divorce

Guo Guoan asks: When a man named Jia was 20 years old, he married a woman named Yi according to his parents' wishes. They had a daughter who has since passed away. Now Jia is 25 years old and studying in Nanjing. He wants to divorce his wife, but his wife and family do not agree. Please advise: (1) Is a man who marries at the age of 20 legally an adult, and is the marriage valid? (2) If the husband wants a divorce but the wife does not agree, what should he do? (3) If the woman is about 22 years old, how much alimony should the man pay if the divorce is successful? (4) During the war, Jia cohabited with a woman named Yi and had a son and a daughter. Now the woman wants to end the cohabitation relationship. Who should support the children, and how should the property be divided?

[Attorney Mei Pingfan's Answer] (1) A man who marries at the age of 20 is of course valid, and there is no issue of adulthood or not. (2) A divorce requires the consent of both parties. If one party requests a divorce and the other party does not agree, and a lawsuit is involved, the court should investigate whether there are legal grounds to determine whether to grant or reject the divorce. (3) There is no fixed standard for the amount of alimony to be paid in a divorce, so it is not possible to give a precise answer. (4) Cohabitation can be terminated according to law. Who should support the children born to both parties, and how the property should be divided, can be determined by agreement between the parties.

(2) Claiming Back a Land Deed

Zhu Guixiang asks: Jia has a younger brother named Yi. When Yi was young, his parents were poor, so he was raised by his paternal uncle. The uncle's only son died, and in his resentment, he adopted Yi as his son to the Shen family. Decades have passed since then. Yi has married and had children, and Jia also has children. Now the paternal uncle and aunt have passed away, and Jia inherits the estate. His parents are still alive and are supported by Jia. Jia has been doing business in Shanghai. His father has three mu of land, which was mortgaged to the Huang family before the Anti-Japanese War. During the Anti-Japanese War, six years ago, Jia asked Yi to redeem the land. After the land was redeemed, Yi cultivated the land. Yi has not yet given the redemption contract to Jia. Now Jia wants to take back the land for his own cultivation and asks Yi for the land contract and deed, but Yi refuses. Please advise on what legal procedures Jia should follow to legally recover the land.

[Attorney Jiang Pingfan's Answer] Jia can file a lawsuit against Yi to return the contract and return the land.

[Our Own Dispatch] The Foreign Cotton Allocation Committee of the Import Temporary Management Committee held its first meeting at the Central Bank, No. 15 The Bund, yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM. Committee members Li Zheng, Wu Weijing, and Rong Yixin attended, and Liu Wenteng, Tang Xinghai, Guo Dihuo, and Zhang Sili attended as observers. Li Zheng presided over the meeting. Attendees expressed many opinions on the methods for ordering foreign cotton. Finally, it was resolved to require all yarn factories belonging to the Sixth District Cotton Textile Association to provide the following two figures by the 17th of this month: (1) Cotton inventory: including (A) cotton inventory as of the end of last year, (B) foreign cotton already ordered but not yet approved, and (C) the amount of domestic cotton to be purchased. (2) Estimated amount of raw cotton needed for this year. The above two figures must be reported to the Foreign Cotton Allocation Committee at the Central Bank, No. 15 The Bund, before the deadline so that the committee can calculate the required amount of foreign cotton based on this. The Spinning Management Committee has notified yarn factories in Qingdao, Hankou, Tianjin, and other places, stating that those who need to purchase foreign cotton must report the amount of cotton inventory to the committee as soon as possible for verification. It is understood that the amount of foreign exchange allocated by the government for the purchase of foreign cotton has also been stipulated. If the required amount exceeds this stipulation too much, it will be necessary to proportionally reduce the required amount of each factory. The committee has scheduled a second meeting for the 18th to review the figures reported by the factories in order to decide on the method for purchasing foreign cotton.

### China Textile Construction Resumes Listing; Yarn Market Unable to Rise

[Our Own Dispatch] Yesterday, China Textile Construction Corporation resumed listing and selling yarn. The prices of various types of cotton yarn were in principle 2.5% to 10% lower than the market price on Saturday of last week. Coarse yarn below 20 counts was about 2.5% lower. 20 counts were about 4% lower. Yarn above 20 counts was 6% to 10% lower. The allocation target is completely limited to manufacturers newly registered with the company. The company originally planned to give reproduction industries priority in purchasing this time. However, after checking the number of cotton yarn pieces applied for, the total was only 2,199 pieces, so there was no priority given, and all were allocated. Among them, 1,118 pieces were for reproduction industries and 1,081 pieces were for yarn number industries. A total of 761 households applied. The company will continue to list and sell yarn on Wednesday and Friday of this week. The company's brand names, pieces, and prices of various yarns listed yesterday are recorded as follows:

In the end, sales were few, and many people were selling, so heavy-weight goods were relatively stable. However, light-weight 20-count yarn was sold under the factory's name, and prices were reduced to seek cash. For example, a large bag of 20-count Jincheng yarn was sold for only 2 million, and the rest of the straw-bag goods had all entered the 2 million range.

### Guidance Office Urges All Industries to Submit Written Reports

[Report from This Newspaper] In order to understand the actual difficulties of various industrial and commercial sectors in the city, the Industrial and Commercial Guidance Office has convened responsible persons from various sectors for detailed discussions, and hopes that each sector will submit written reports on their own difficulties and special opinions. According to Mr. Ouyang Lun, Director of the Industrial and Commercial Guidance Office, many sectors have already submitted written reports to the office. Those who have not yet submitted are being urged to do so as soon as possible. The Guidance Office plans to discuss these reports in detail and study them carefully, so as to alleviate the pain of various industrial and commercial sectors within the possible scope, and avoid the drawbacks of favoring one over the other. In the past, when the Industrial and Commercial Guidance Office listened to the opinions of various sectors, this kind of difficulty occurred. For example, manufacturers of finished products hoped to relax the import of raw materials to reduce production costs, while manufacturers of raw materials requested to restrict the import of raw materials so as not to be eliminated by foreign goods. In the future, if such situations occur, the Guidance Office will invite both parties to negotiate in order to find a solution. The collection and study of these written reports will take about half a month. It is expected that the office will have concrete measures formulated in early February.

### China's Trade with East India Is Exceptionally Sluggish

[Report from This Newspaper] Regarding the trade situation between China and East India, the reporter specially visited Mr. Stark, the Commercial Counselor of the Netherlands Consulate. According to him, the trade between East India and China has been exceptionally sluggish recently. On the export side, due to exchange rate and cost issues, the number of Chinese goods shipped overseas is not large, and even fewer are shipped to the East India region. Chinese goods are not easy to compete with goods from other countries there, so the export side is almost at a standstill. On the import side, East India ships seafood, olive oil, mineral oil, chemical raw materials, and rubber to China. Among them, seafood imports have become difficult due to restrictions from Chinese customs. Other goods are mostly shipped to the United States or the Netherlands. Although China has a strong need, it is not easy to buy them. Currently, companies specializing in commerce between the two places, such as the Great Dutch Company, the Gu Shun Company, and the Good Time Foreign Firm, all feel this difficulty and hope to improve it.

### Resumption of Old Normal Schools: Government Approves Operation in a Entrusted Capacity; Private Nantong Normal School and Suzhou Jinghai Normal School to Be Restored

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 13th] Private secondary schools, such as middle schools and vocational schools, can apply to the government for approval of establishment in accordance with the regulations for private schools. However, normal schools are related to the national cultivation of teachers and should be operated by the government. Private establishment is not allowed at will. However, around the establishment of the National Government, private individuals who ran normal schools with outstanding achievements and a long history may be entrusted by the government to resume operations. For example, the private Nantong Normal School and the Suzhou Jinghai Normal School have been approved by the Jiangsu Department of Education to operate as normal schools entrusted by the Jiangsu Department of Education. Because normal schools are generally operated by the government, private normal schools cannot operate on their own without being entrusted by the government.

### The Southeastern Transportation Network's Central Hub: The Qiantang River Bridge

— Hangzhou, January 6th dispatch from our reporter Huang Xingtian

Zhejiang is the smallest province in the country, yet the Qiantang River divides it into two distinct areas: the western part of Zhejiang belongs to Jiangnan, with crisscrossing rivers and convenient transportation; while the eastern part borders Fujian and Jiangxi, with dense mountains and difficult travel. Due to the different natural environments, the customs, culture, and economy also have significant differences. In fact, the main reason lies in the treacherous Qiantang River, known for its turbulent waves and slippery shoals. As the saying goes, "Pass the Qiantang River every day, sleep soundly in bed every night," even experienced travelers hesitate to cross. It evokes the exclamation of "Can't be done, brother!" As early as two thousand years ago, there was an ideal to build a large bridge to connect the east and west of Zhejiang. After the completion of the great Great Wall construction during the Qin Dynasty, the supervising official in charge went south to Wu and Yue, hoping to visit famous mountains and beautiful waters to wash away the exhaustion of defensive construction with the gentle natural scenery. However, upon arriving at the riverbank, a vast and meandering river stretched before him, with turbulent waves and slippery mudflats. Navigating a small wooden boat was extremely dangerous! Thus, in the mind of this great builder, the plan for a river bridge was born. However, the Qin Dynasty, having subdued the six kingdoms internally and fearing no external enemies like the Xiongnu, did not pursue meaningful great constructions, but instead yearned for absolute power and personal wealth, leading to tyranny and destruction. The beautiful dream ultimately shattered with the nightmare. It was not until November 11, 1934, under the direction of bridge expert Dr. Mao Yisheng, that the ideal of the supervising official in charge of the Great Wall more than two thousand years ago descended from a fantastical dream into the real world.

A Glorious History, a Page of Song and Tears

The Qiantang River Bridge is, domestically, second only to the Yellow River Railway Bridge on the Pinghan Railway as a great bridge engineering project. The entire bridge is one kilometer long, with a double-layered structure, featuring 220-foot low-chord trusses designed by American bridge expert Dr. Waddell. The upper level is for automobile and pedestrian traffic, while the lower level is a single-track railway. The three types of traffic do not interfere with each other and can pass simultaneously without the need for signal control or mutual avoidance. The width is 13.88 meters, the height is 10.5 meters, with fifteen piers divided into sixteen spans; the truss beam is 1003 meters long, the pile-supported approach bridge is 643 meters long, and the steel plate beam is 214 meters long. The magnitude of the scale can be seen from these figures. The difficulty of the bridge construction is unparalleled by the Yellow River Railway Bridge. Because the Qiantang River is a natural barrier, with rapid currents and strong tides, the erosion is significant, capable of deepening the riverbed by 5.5 meters in five months. As a result, the cross-section of accumulated sediment often changed, making it impossible to secure the bridge piles, causing much anxiety and helplessness among experts. It wasn't until 1932 that the Zhejiang Provincial Construction Department decided to propose the bridge construction and began drilling, discovering that the bottom of the riverbed was stone, sloping sharply from north to south. Above the stone layer, the soil was soft mud and fine sand, mixed with very little coarse sand and pebbles. The depth of the river was about 70 feet at its shallowest and about 150-160 feet below the Wusong zero point at its deepest, with the water level rising and falling up to 15 feet due to tides. Therefore, the bridge piers had to be deeply embedded, using pneumatic caissons for excavation and pile driving, which was a first in the history of bridge construction in China. The completion of the Qiantang River Bridge connected the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway, which had been severed by the Qiantang River, and also connected to the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway and the Guangdong-Han Railway, allowing the plan to extend the main lines of the southeastern transportation system to the capital to be completed. On the highways, it connected the Shanghai-Hangzhou, Beijing-Hangzhou, Hangzhou-Hui, Hangzhou-Guangdong, and Hangzhou-Fujian roads, enabling the completion of the transportation network for seven provinces. The Qiantang River, which was an obstacle in the arteries of the seven southeastern provinces, was finally removed with the bridge under the direction of Chief Engineer Dr. Mao Yisheng. Its cost was only five million yuan.

The Qiantang River Bridge is great, and its greatness lies not only in its own construction, but also in its glorious history of song and tears. On September 15, 1937, the first train passed over the Qiantang River Bridge, and on November 16th, the automobile road also opened to traffic. Readers should remember that it was during the bloody battle of Shanghai against the Japanese, when enemy planes were carrying sinful bombs over the heads of the Chinese people. By October, the highway on the south bank was gradually completed, and the iron railings on both sides of the bridge were installed. Hangzhou was already tense, and transportation north from Nanjing and Pukou was impossible, so refugees could only retreat to eastern Zhejiang. Trains, cars, rickshaws, bicycles, and pedestrians crossed the bridge day and night, and a large amount of materials were safely transported across the river. According to the calculations of the two railway bureaus, at that time, at least two hundred train locomotives and more than two thousand carriages were evacuated through the bridge, and the 600,000 troops under General Liu Jianxu, who were defending the Hangzhou-Jiaxing area, as well as their military supplies, were gradually evacuated across the river.

The Bridge Was Completed Amidst National Crisis and First Served the War of Resistance

The Qiantang River Bridge was completed at a time of national crisis, and it first served the War of Resistance, saving so much manpower and resources for the country, which is incomparable to the cost of five million yuan. However, on December 20th, after completing its emergency mission, the Qiantang River Bridge was finally destroyed by its original builders, who placed explosives on the 14th pier to prevent it from being used by the enemy. On the 23rd, at noon, a loud explosion occurred near the Liuhe Pagoda, and the bridge was severed. At that time, enemy troops advancing from Shanghai to Fuyang had already invaded Hangzhou. The 14th pier was completely destroyed by the explosion, and the steel beams of the 15th, 16th, 11th, 12th, and 13th spans fell into the water. The vast river, like thousands of troops and horses, formed a natural defense line. Our troops deployed along the river on the south bank and finally prevented the enemy's poisonous flames from advancing south.

In September 1940, after the enemy occupied Jiangnan, they forcibly crossed the river and advanced south to eastern Zhejiang, stationing troops on both sides of the bridgeheads and trying to open the bridge to traffic to aid their advance. Japanese engineers designed the bridge, chiseling through the inclined and sunken sections of the road surface, removing the concrete and steel bars, leaving only a steel frame, greatly reducing the weight of the bridge, so that it could be lifted by a crane and repaired. They dismantled the railroad ties on the bottom layer and tried to open a single-lane highway first. By November 1943, the enemy had penetrated deep into eastern Zhejiang, and the provincial government was cornered in Yunhe. The enemy cavalry approached Jiangxi, connecting the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway to Jinhua, and wanted to connect with the Shanghai-Hangzhou line to avoid the inconvenience of ferrying across the river. Thus, a major construction project was undertaken to repair the bridge piers. On October 17, 1944, it was officially opened to traffic. During the eight years of the War of Resistance, the Japanese invaders only committed murder, arson, and destruction south of Xuzhou, with no construction. The repair of the Qiantang River Bridge was probably the only construction project. Although, their purpose was maliciously to occupy our beautiful land! Amidst the evil construction of the brutal sun, our guerrilla heroes wrote many loyal and courageous deeds on the bridge. On the night of March 28, 1944, they blew up the fifth pier. At 3:30 AM on February 4, 1945, amidst heavy rain, six soldiers from the Loyalty and Salvation Army's demolition squad, under heavy enemy guard, risked entering the bridge in two wooden boats fully loaded with explosives and placed a large amount of explosives on both sides of the sixth pier. When the thunderous explosion shook the sky, scaring the guarding "Imperial Army" into a frenzy, our soldiers safely returned to the guerrilla base in eastern Zhejiang in the misty night, bathed in the dim starlight before dawn. After daybreak, the "invincible" Imperial Army tremblingly came out of the fortifications and conducted a large-scale search in the towns and villages on both the north and south banks, intimidating the kind farmers. But they found nothing, only the harsh wind of winter in the fields and the rushing tide in the river, stealthily and yet omnipresently, sending jeering laughter into their ears. On the river, the first pier had a new hole and two cracks, and the steel rails on the bridge deck were overturned in twenty-six places. After two months and twenty-one days of emergency repairs, the enemy restored the pulse of the bridge. After that, they used this great artery to extract precious blood from our motherland's cells and inject the invaders' poison!

However, the sun was setting on their doomed path, and the total collapse of the navy forced the bloodthirsty Japanese invaders to surrender four months later. Many brave soldiers and villagers from the mountains of southern Zhejiang, Fujian, and Jiangxi, returned to their beloved hometowns through the bridge. The national flag with the blue sky, white sun, and crimson earth, flew again above the bridge. West Lake was still so gentle and beautiful, and Liuhe Pagoda stood proudly in the valley of Hupao, watching the vast river flow freely, and the white sails break through the waves and move forward. The motherland, light, and freedom, were waving ahead! The wind laughed, the sun laughed, and Liuhe Pagoda, you laughed too...

Visiting the Repair of the Bridge at the Zhakou Gate: The Piers Have Not Sunk

Last October, the Dongya Construction Company contracted the bridge repair project. Due to financial difficulties, they could only temporarily repair the automobile road. At the same time, to reduce the weight of the bridge, they used wooden strips instead of concrete for the sleepers, tightly spaced and nailed on the steel beam supports, and then nailed one-third-inch thick wooden boards, so that automobiles weighing up to twenty tons could pass safely. On the first day of the project, our reporter made a special trip to Zhakou to see the bridge repair. From afar, the bridge looked the same as before the war, lying across the river without any sign of damage. Except for the five spans where the enemy had chipped off the concrete, the bridge was very flat and solid, better than any Shen Qing road in Hangzhou city. At the sixth pier, the north end of the bridge deck had sunk six inches. It was rumored that the pier had sunk, frightening the passengers on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway every day. But according to Dr. Mao Yisheng's explanation to the reporter, "This is not the pier sinking, but because the steel frame was shaken up when the bridge was blown up in February 1945, and some of the Gan axles filled in at the north end flew away, and the remaining ones changed from a vertical to a flat state, causing the steel frame at the north end to sink six inches, forming an uneven phenomenon." The so-called Gan axle is a natural method used to compensate for the thermal expansion and contraction of steel. The two frames of the bridge are connected to each other, and circular axes with a diameter of six inches are used between the pier and the steel frame, standing in the middle; when hot, they turn outwards, and when cold, they turn inwards, to maintain a certain distance between the bridge bodies. The stone layer of the Qiantang River is originally sloped from north to south. The north is high and the south is low, and the sixth pier is located at the intersection, so special attention was paid to it during the initial construction. Without using wooden piles, the steel and concrete bridge body, which is ninety-four feet long, was built directly on the rocks at the bottom of the river. At the same time, the Gan axle is installed only at one end of the Zhen frame, and the other end is fixed. Therefore, the steel frame connected to the sixth pier has more Gan axles filled underneath. During that explosion, only one end of the Gan axle flew away. If the other end had flown away at the same time, the bridge deck would have been flat. Although there is now a height difference of six inches, it has been filled with concrete, and there should be no problem for traffic.

In Order to Interview the Bridge Repair Engineer, I Walked Through Five Spans of the Bridge

In order to interview the engineer in charge of the bridge repair, our reporter summoned the greatest courage that day to walk across five steel frames, more than seven meters above the river and one hundred and ten meters long, and crossed the river to the south bank. Looking back now, I wonder how I managed to walk across. At the time, it was just an ordinary feeling of self-awareness. The bridge repair worker said that the engineer had gone to the south bank, and I thought that if the engineer could walk across, why couldn't I? With a naive vigor, I stepped onto the narrow steel beam. After walking a few steps, I discovered that underneath was the Qiantang River, a "bottomless abyss." The river was turbulent, and each whirlpool seemed like a gaping mouth waiting for me. I remembered the one hundred workers who had been swallowed by this mouth during the bridge construction, and my legs went weak. I could only hold my breath and take the slowest steps without looking around. The five spans of the bridge that had been destroyed were originally separated, one span in the north and four spans in the south. One of the spans in the middle was still intact. After finally walking across one span, I felt discouraged looking at the four spans of the steel markers ahead. I measured the width of the steel beam, and it was only three hands wide! Some of them were not steel plates but cross-shaped steel bars! I was even afraid to turn back. But my proud self-esteem forced me to continue. "If the engineer can walk across, why can't I?" I finally went on. The river was so deep, so far, and so scary, so scary that it seemed very close, close enough that if my foot slipped, I could kiss it, kiss it to death! Looking at the Qiantang River from the Liuhe Pagoda, the Qiantang River is so vast and magnificent, making one's heart broad; but now, I only felt its horror. I felt like an ant crawling on a straw, and the straw was placed on a deep well, making me afraid to look at the rapid currents and waves under my feet. Looking at the bridge from afar, it doesn't seem that long, but walking on it felt like an endless journey. There were only five spans of steel beams, why couldn't I finish walking? This experience made me feel more deeply the greatness of the Qiantang River Bridge.

Temporary Repair: Traffic Can Be Opened in Two Months

According to the engineer in charge, the Qiantang River Bridge is so important that it cannot be delayed for lack of money. Therefore, temporary repairs were made first: paving the road with wood, reducing the road surface to three meters wide. Although it can only allow one car to pass at a time, it can also connect the highway network in eastern and western Zhejiang, providing great convenience to land transportation in the southeast. It is estimated that traffic can be opened in two months. At the end of last year, the project was completed as scheduled, and the test run was successfully completed. However, the preparations for management methods and technology were not enough, such as the management stations at both ends had not been established, the telephone communication line had not been laid, the method of toll collection had not been determined, etc. Once these preparations are completed, the bridge can be opened to traffic. Dr. Mao Yisheng declared very frankly: "The reason why traffic is temporarily prohibited now is not because of military secrets, as people think, but to ensure their safety. It will probably be officially opened to traffic in about a month." The Ministry of Communications has ordered the establishment of a bridge management office by the bridge engineering office, responsible for the maintenance, traffic, and toll collection of the Qiantang River Bridge. Before the entire repair project of the bridge is completed, the following will be stipulated: (1) Trains and automobiles must not pass at the same time; (2) All vehicles other than automobiles are prohibited from passing on the highway bridge surface; (3) Before the bridge lights are installed, highway vehicles are prohibited from passing from 5:00 PM to 6:00 AM the next morning; (4) Pedestrians are prohibited from passing before the railings on both sides of the sidewalk are installed, to ensure traffic safety.

The Qiantang River Bridge has been preliminarily repaired. But when will we see the entire solid repair completed, so that the main artery of the southeast can be smoother and connect the highway traffic of seven provinces? Chief Engineer Mao Yisheng, the original builder of the bridge, told reporters: "The central government has approved 2.5 billion yuan for the reconstruction of the bridge this year. Although this amount is still far from the funds required for the entire repair, we believe that we will gradually complete this sky bridge that was destroyed, so that this hub connecting the southeastern transportation can live up to its name." The reporter passed this on to all readers who care about this lock of southeastern transportation.

Temporary repairs were made by paving the bridge with wood, three meters wide, allowing automobiles weighing up to 20 tons to pass. The picture shows a glimpse of the repair situation (Photo by our reporter Huang Xingtian)

### Mrs. Shaw—Introducing a Typical Couple—

— Yu Renfeng

The great British writer George Bernard Shaw is already ninety-one years old this year. When he is mentioned, readers probably have an impression of him. If they are not forgetful, they should still remember that when he came to our country that year, the first thing he talked about was the women of our country, which caused opposition from the women's circles in our country. However, these are not what I want to talk about. This is just to help readers recall their impression of him from their minds.

We all know that Shaw is a famous writer in the world of literature. The reason why he is what he is today is certainly due to his own talent and efforts, but there is also one thing that contributed to his success, and that is his wife.

Mrs. Shaw is an amiable woman. She and Shaw have the same humorous nature, and she also has a mysterious influence. Whether her relatives or friends, they are easily influenced by her.

They were married in 1898. At that time, Shaw was already thirty-two years old. At that time, the wedding ceremony and the arrangement of the home were very simple. However, she can make the arrangement of the home elegant and artistic. Her main purpose is to inspire her husband's literary inspiration. Her thoughtfulness to her husband is evident from this.

In addition to taking care of household affairs, she also tried her best to comfort her husband, encourage her husband, and enable him to concentrate on his dramatic works.

Speaking of which, Mrs. Shaw also has a special skill, that is, she does not like to show off. This is something that ordinary people cannot do. She only does the practical work of transforming society wholeheartedly. She works hard for various movements to transform society. She also made a great contribution to the literary world in England, which is to translate the script of the famous French playwright Brieux into English and introduce it to the British people. Her fluent and smooth writing has been praised by general readers.

When I read Shaw's works, I will think of her, because she is the one who made the world's great writer.

From this point of view, the influence of a wife on her husband's future has a great weight. I hope that the women of our country will pay attention!

After reading Ms. Wu Wanhua's "Blind Milk," it reminded me of the pain I suffered from blind milk a few years ago. Now I will describe it, which may be used as a reference for those who suffer from the same disease! I got married when I was nineteen years old. A year after my marriage, I gave birth to a daughter. Similarly, I was worried about how my child would grow up, because my breasts were also underdeveloped and had no nipples. I once asked my sister and my husband to suck on them, until my breasts were red, swollen, and bleeding, but there was still no way to suck out the nipples, and the baby, crying for milk, added a lot of trouble. In the state of my husband's meager income and poor family circumstances, it was difficult to cope with life, and there was no way to hire a nanny or eat milk powder. However, I couldn't watch the little life go to its demise. Every day, I made thin porridge with rice flour to serve as her daily diet. In a very short period of time, she became a tragic figure with only skin and bones left. Seeing that there was no other way, I had to send her to the countryside to be nursed by someone else and do some needlework myself to supplement the expenses.

But God often plays tricks on people. When my child was one year old, I became pregnant again, which made me feel very afraid. At that time, my husband's income was better. I used various methods to try to transform this underdeveloped breast, worrying about its progress almost every moment, seeking medical treatment, and looking for secret prescriptions. It controlled our entire thoughts, but in the end, there was still no way to make it protrude.

When I was six months pregnant, relatives and friends sent some longans and walnuts. My husband came up with a whimsical idea and used walnut shells to treat my inverted nipples. He chose the largest and deepest walnuts, broke them open along the grain without damaging them, took out the kernels inside, polished the edges and inside, put a little bit of defatted cotton inside, and covered the shell on the "blind" part where the nipple was retracted. He made a tighter bra to tightly cover the walnut shell on the retracted nipple of the breast—the walnut shell must touch the flesh—during the period not far from the due date, when the breast expanded, the nipple may develop into the walnut shell and protrude. When I took off my bra one night, and removed the walnut shell, I found that I had nipples. I was shocked and stunned. Although it protruded, its appearance was too scary. It was blood-red and split into multiple pieces. I was very worried about how it could feed the baby properly? Later, I wiped it with alcohol every night to make it slightly stimulated and gradually harden. After two months, it had all protruded. When I gave birth, I threw away the walnut shells. Now my nipple is no longer a blind eye, and my child can of course be breastfed by myself. No need to worry anymore. I guess Ms. Wu's nipple is still blind. I hope that when you are pregnant again, try the above method, and I guarantee that you can have a satisfactory result. At the same time, I hope that those who suffer from blind milk can follow suit.

(II)

After reading Ms. Wu Wanhua's "Blind Milk," I thought of a few words from my mother. Although they are old methods, they are also based on experience. I will record them below for the study of the modern and scientifically developed medical community.

After an infant leaves the mother's womb for the first time, attention must be paid to his or her breasts, because at this time, it is already known whether the infant is a boy or a girl. If it is a girl, then you must not be careless. You should gently squeeze the infant's small, ant-like left and right breasts a few times to eliminate the hidden danger of blind milk in the future. This is really an easy thing to do; however, the current obstetricians do not have this small action, which has harmed the breasts of people like Ms. Wu. I also have a proof, which is that my youngest daughter's left and right breasts are one convex and one concave. Because the obstetrician who delivered the baby that year did not follow the above procedure, my mother inquired and knew that there was a hidden danger, so she hurriedly squeezed and grasped it again, but because it was a few days late, only one side protruded. The other side had to be the same as Ms. Wu's.

Vinegar that has been stored for a long time will produce mold flowers. If you add a little bit of stir-fried salt, it will not occur even if it is stored for a long time.

Tea that has been stored for a long time is easy to become damp. If you take a piece of charcoal, dry it thoroughly, wrap it in paper, place it at the bottom of the tea bottle, and close the lid tightly, the tea leaves will not spoil for a long time.

Bad breath is annoying. To remove it, use Xiangxiang decoction to rinse and wash your mouth, and also take one or two li of Binghe powder. It can be cured in three to five days, and from then on, the words spoken will be fragrant. It is really a wonderful method.

Cut eggplants into small pieces and rub them on your face to remove freckles.

### The Tear Glands of Women

— Sweet Breeze

Why do women cry so much? This is truly a strange thing. No matter how big or small the matter, men do not feel much sadness or grief, but women are already overwhelmed with sorrow and tears flow freely. When Han E wailed, the old and young in the village faced each other for three days without eating. Throughout history, how many heroes have been sacrificed to the tears of women? According to anatomy, the tear glands of women are not particularly more developed than those of men. According to Richardson's research, tears are not necessarily the result of pain. Even with extreme pain, it is not easy to cry. Only those with the most developed sympathetic nerves, who are easily stimulated by joy, sorrow, fear, and other basic emotions, tend to cry a lot. Therefore, women's tears are entirely due to their emotional nature, and there is no significant difference in tear glands between them and men.

### The Ideal Husband

— Yi Ren

Having served society for half a lifetime, now seeking a family.

Reading the December 31st edition of this column, there was an article titled "My Ideal Wife" written by a Mr. Gang. I couldn't help but be moved and wanted to write about my ideal husband to express the emotions I've accumulated in my heart. Before I begin, let me introduce myself. I was born in a town near the Yangtze River, where there were several middle schools. My father was a peaceful and law-abiding scholar-farmer, and my mother knew a few characters as well. So, I often heard my father reciting classical poems and my mother telling endless interesting stories. I led my three younger brothers to school and play. When the sacred War of Resistance began, I had just finished middle school. Through a friend's introduction, I started learning nursing at a private hospital. A year later, the Japanese invaded our hometown, and I had to give up medicine and return to high school. After graduating, I taught at a primary school not far from home. From various educational books and practical experience, I understood the psychology of children and became close companions with these little angels.

After the victory, I went to Shanghai and worked as a secretary for a female lawyer and as a tutor. During my free time, I did needlework and cooked for my mother, planted melons and removed weeds with my father, built flower beds with my brothers, or built houses for the rabbits. Life was very interesting. In short, in the past twenty-five years, I have indeed thought about how to find my life partner—a husband.

In feudal society, men demanded that women be charming, able to sing and dance, but ignorant of politics and worldly affairs, so that they would forever be men's playthings. Loved ones would beckon them, and hateful ones would drive them away, constantly enacting the tragedy of "beautiful women with tragic fates." Of course, this is a different era now. Men's ideal wives are indeed like what Mr. Gang described. However, before the remnants of feudal poison are cleared, looking around, pitiful women are often abandoned by those men who are full of moral platitudes, and those innocent children who have lost their fathers or mothers also become victims. It seems that men demand that women not complain in times of hardship, while women hope that their husbands will remember their humble beginnings when they become rich and powerful. I am a woman, so I hope to find an ideal husband to comfort the rest of my life.

First, the age difference should not be too great, preferably four or five years, and definitely no more than ten years. Because a large age difference leads to different interests. The man will find the wife to be immature and not qualified as a housewife, while the woman will find the husband to be old-fashioned and unable to find youthful tenderness. A father-like husband is undesirable.

He should have a scientific mind, a flexible thought process, a healthy physique, an unoffensive appearance, the virtue of forgiveness, the skill of independence, and a cheerful mood with tender enthusiasm, empathy, and helpfulness. During the courtship period, he should fully express his ambitions, openly exchange opinions, and point out each other's shortcomings, without concealing or compromising, so that disappointment will not arise after marriage, leading to incompatibility.

Husband and wife are lifelong friends. Do not force each other to be overly loyal. Instead, face each other with sincerity and work together to promote the success of their careers. Don't think that a marriage based on love is a lifelong guarantee, allowing you to be reckless. He should understand that respect is mutual, not one-sided, and that they should comfort and understand each other, without being overly willful. For example, returning home late at night, causing the wife anxiety, or reeking of alcohol, making her uncomfortable... If financially able, save as much as possible. If there is leisure time from work, find ways to relax, striving for elegance rather than vulgarity. Choose any hobby, such as music, chess, poetry, or painting. It is best to stay away from smoking, alcohol, and gambling. Greet visiting relatives and friends together. Participate in necessary social events together. On the one hand, it is practicing social skills, and on the other hand, it can enhance love and reduce many suspicions.

In this vast crowd, under the condition of "rather be without than settle," I am sincerely choosing my ideal husband.

### Where is Sheng Shicai?

— Qi Wen

Chairman Zhang Zhizhong, in his speech in Nanjing regarding the new provincial politics, mentioned Sheng Shicai. He openly expressed his deep regret for Sheng Shicai's past governance of Xinjiang, stating that Sheng's "sins" had sown the seeds of ethnic hatred. In today's ever-changing internal and external situation, this is especially alarming.

But where is Sheng Shicai now? What has been his whereabouts since he resigned from the position of Minister of Agriculture and Forestry? The news is silent, and no one knows the truth. It seems Sheng Shicai is forever a mysterious figure, difficult to guess.

Grand and Chaotic, Utterly Embarrassing

After the national government returned to its capital, Sheng Shicai left Chongqing in July last year and followed the government east, preparing to live in Nanjing. However, he is not in Nanjing now. When he left Chongqing, he did not expect a new beginning. He and his wife, son, private attendants, and guards, a total of twenty or thirty people, carrying luggage and private property in seven or eight cars, formed a considerable procession returning to the capital. They departed from Chongqing, passed through Guangyuan, exited Jiange to Baoji. Passing through these small cities, they presented a grand and chaotic scene. No one knew that it was Sheng Shicai, the once powerful frontier official, passing by, until they reached Baoji in Shaanxi and stayed in a hotel, still without disturbing the local area. They originally wanted to pass through quietly, but after traveling a long distance, they finally reached a city with train access. His attendants and guards couldn't help but wander around, and his son went to a Qinqiang opera house.

Baoji was a major rear base during the War of Resistance and is currently the end of the Longhai Railway. A certain team there had extraordinary power, all "eight-year veterans of the War of Resistance," and were not to be trifled with. Sheng Shicai's son encountered one of them in the theater and asked him to give up his seat, saying it was reserved. A dispute arose. Before anyone could react, the Sheng's face had already been struck. Sheng's son, unable to fight back alone, "avoided immediate losses" and ran back to the hotel. He gathered all the guards, armed with guns, and rushed to the theater, found the team member, and retaliated with a beating before leaving.

The team thought they had encountered a tough opponent and felt extremely embarrassed. They mobilized overnight, rushed to the hotel, and entered in a swarm. They couldn't find anyone, so they smashed everything from cars to houses, from doors and windows to tables and chairs, hitting men and women alike, hitting and looting everything they saw, causing chaos. Sheng Shicai was confused and thought it was a mutiny, but then realized it wasn't. So he ran out and shouted, "I am Minister Sheng, what's the matter with me! Stop hitting!" But he couldn't stop them. After the team left, feeling satisfied, they discovered that the cars had been smashed, the iron boxes opened, and the property scattered. Sheng Shicai then inquired of the local military and political leaders. The person responsible for local security was also the leader of the team, making the matter extremely awkward. Hu Zongnan, the commander of the First War Zone, upon hearing the news, rushed from Xi'an to Baoji the next day and took Sheng Shicai to Xi'an. He thoroughly investigated the team and recovered some US dollar bills. Sheng Shicai's losses were incalculable, so he decided not to go to Nanjing and stayed in Xi'an. It is said that he still lives in Wangqu, Xi'an.

Comparing Sheng Shicai of Xinjiang to Sheng Shicai today is already regrettable, and this episode is truly both laughable and tragic.

### Introducing Dr. Li Denghui

— Jin Xia

The National Government recently issued an order to commend Dr. Li Denghui, former president of Fudan University, to recognize his contributions to education and cultural undertakings for more than thirty years.

Mr. Li is from Tongan County, Fujian Province, born in Batavia, Java. After growing up, he entered Yale University in the United States and obtained a doctorate. He only returned to China for the first time at the age of thirty. At first, he could only communicate with people in Hokkien and English, but later he gradually learned Shanghainese and Mandarin. He is known as the "old senior of Chinese English writers." He has published no less than twenty or thirty English works in Zhonghua and the Commercial Press, mostly textbooks. In addition to English, he is also proficient in French, German, Italian, Spanish, Greek, Latin, and the Weilai language. Indeed, he can also be given the title of "linguist."

Mr. Li is a devout Christian. He has been deeply influenced by religion since childhood. He always carries a small English Bible in his bag and pocket, reading and praying from it from time to time.

Mr. Li also has a good sense of humor. When he sees his desk piled with letters, he always says, "This has become a post office."

He had many opportunities to become an official or a big merchant, but he made education his lifelong career, which is especially rare and worthy of our respect!

### Let's Talk About Prodigies

— Dai Ling

Luck and misfortune, how many geniuses are buried.

The newspapers these days seem to have many reports about child prodigies: an eleven-year-old girl completing a lengthy masterpiece; a two-and-a-half-year-old boy skilled in writing regular and cursive scripts. If there is no exaggeration or propaganda involved, then it is indeed something worth celebrating and rejoicing about. Below is an article about European and American child prodigies, which can add interest for readers.

The number of musical prodigies is the largest—perhaps because this art relies half on technique and half on emotional understanding. Many of today's great violinists were famous in childhood. Josef Hofmann toured Europe performing at the age of twelve; his teacher, Ros Schlandeski, played works by Beethoven and Chopin in New York at the age of eight.

Musical Prodigies: Most Fortunate

Musical prodigies are the most fortunate. Prodigies in other fields often fade into obscurity as they grow up. Dr. Terman, a genius children expert at Stanford University, said with emotion, "We still don't know how to keep prodigies' talents permanent!"

About fifty years ago, Binet and Simon created the "intelligence test." Dr. Terman improved it, and by 1922, he had obtained 1,300 boys and girls with outstanding test scores. To this day, he still keeps in touch with 85% of them.

According to his latest report, Dr. Terman said that 3% of them have died. In addition, among the living, 90% of the boys and 85% of the girls have attended college. They are on average two years younger than their classmates. The number of honors degrees they receive is three times higher than that of ordinary students. Many people remain as university professors, but most are not very successful.

Among this group of people, men's interest in law far outweighs engineering, geology, medicine, teaching, religion, or social work. Two of them became band musicians, and one is making a splash in Hollywood. In addition, one is a police officer, one is a farmer, and another is a sailor. During the depression, less than 1% of them were unemployed, and no one needed relief.

One lawyer earned $12,000 a year at the age of twenty. A young radio operator's income was $10,000. The two band musicians earned an average of $6,000. The lowest income for those people was $250 per month; women mostly taught or worked in offices, earning an average of $125 per month.

What about the many failed children? Dr. Terman said that their failure was entirely due to the influence of heredity and environment. "Several children discovered that kicking a football earned them more than being writers, musicians, artists, or mathematicians. Others felt bored with those monotonous courses far below their level... That fact made me feel disappointed."

Dr. Terman is disappointed because, from a historical perspective, many talented people came from child prodigies. John Stuart Mill wrote "The History of Rome" at the age of six. Huibsster entered middle school at the age of four. Byron was familiar with the "Old Testament" at the age of eight. Hugo talked incessantly at the age of six. Coleridge read "Arabian Nights" at the age of five. Goethe wrote Latin prose at the age of seven. Cooper and Pope were proficient in Greek and Latin before the age of ten.

But talent is not always discovered in childhood. Edison, a great scientist, was scolded by his teacher as "naughty." His mother took him out of school and taught him herself.

The future for child prodigies in the film industry is even more dangerous. Fler Barseme, an American child star who shone brightly ten years ago, is now forgotten. Mike Hogan, who co-starred with Chaplin, is now reduced to working as a waiter in a Hollywood hotel.

Another child star, Mike Cooper, was recently expelled from the film industry for committing a crime. Even the glory of Xiulan Temple is less bright than before.

Looking back at the achievements of child prodigies in the music world, Josef Hofmann earned $15,000 a year at the age of ten. Several years ago, his first visit to the United States for performance made a profit of $60,000. Another pianist, Otto Hainar, had a total income of $150,000 as a child.

Mathematical Prodigies: Most Unfortunate

Mathematical prodigies are the most unfortunate. When Zira Kaupeng was six years old, someone asked him how many seconds are in ten years. After calculating in his mind for a minute, he replied, "63,072,000,000." But in today's world where electrical computers known for speed and accuracy are prevalent, Kaupeng's name is no longer mentioned.

The achievements of Italian sculptor Victor Laiti in childhood were unmatched by others. He earned more than $20,000 at the age of ten. His total income was far greater than that of any other Italian sculptor. Several of his early works were even compared to those of the master Michelangelo, but today no one remembers him.

Few modern child prodigies have succeeded. Nai Sha Liklan, who was famous for his poem "The Child of Siger" at the age of eleven, still writes poetry today, but his status in the American poetry world is not high. Ellen Elizabeth Pearson, who wrote "Young Generation" at the age of twelve, is now a mother and uses her talent to create puzzle games. She said, "I think we 'prodigies' are all monsters. I'm glad I'm a normal person now."

Prodigies are rare, but it is even more difficult to keep the "genius" label permanent. Especially in today's world of "man can conquer nature," don't let "cleverness be mistaken for cleverness"!

The Life of a Scientist

### Diligent, Simple, and Humorous: Einstein

— Meng Yang

"...Of all his habits, he loved simplicity the most. Whether washing or shaving, he used the same bar of soap because he felt that his life did not need to be complicated by using two things...."

A quiet back street, standing in a small house, lives the great scientist of this world, Dr. Einstein. He greeted his visitors casually wearing a zippered shirt and an unbuttoned coat. Einstein smiled apologetically, asking to let him stay at his desk for a few more minutes. Yes, he had just written a few short sentences and some mathematical symbols, the handwriting was so neat and tidy.

His life can be said to be completely spent filling these thousands of white sheets of paper with words, but most of them were thrown into paper tubes. He was able to wield his pen without hesitation, hour after hour. When encountering setbacks and difficulties, he would play the piano or the violin. Or he would take a walk. But consciously or unconsciously, his mind was still focused on that problem; even the important parts of the theory of relativity were discovered when he was pushing his son's stroller and walking alone in Prague.

When he toured the battlefield after World War I, he had lunch at Reims. A few tables away from Einstein, two French senior officers and a lady were also dining. They immediately recognized Einstein. When he got up to leave, the three of them stood up in unison, without saying a word, and bowed deeply to the great physicist. This shows the public's admiration for him.

Of all his habits, he loved simplicity the most. Whether washing or shaving, he used the same bar of soap because he felt that his life did not need to be complicated by using two things. When it got hot, socks seemed to become redundant, so he didn't wear any socks at home. Einstein was also very indifferent to money. Once, he used a check for $1,500 from the Rockefeller Foundation as a bookmark. As a result, he lost the book a few weeks later.

His entertainment was also of the simplest kind, such as walking and boating. He was unwilling to waste his brainpower on playing cards and chess. He didn't drink alcohol. Pipe tobacco was his only permitted luxury—but only three pipes a day.

Einstein never looked down on serving others. After he won the Nobel Prize (1921), he donated all $25,000 to charity, even though his circumstances did not allow him to do so. He was a passionate supporter of the cause he believed in. Once, a postal ship he was on docked in New York for five days due to an accident. Einstein desperately needed rest, so he set three rules: no visitors, no photos, and no appearances in public places. But a reporter found him. He said, "Dr. Einstein, you should allow us to meet you because it is beneficial to Jewish Zionism!" Therefore, before the ship left the quarantine station, Einstein agreed to give a public speech at the banquet and also broadcast it. The entire five days became active and turbulent—for Jewish Zionism!

Einstein was a completely unconventional person. The principal of Suwasmo School, who treated Einstein as an honored guest, asked him to give a lecture. He stood up and said, "Ladies and gentlemen, I really feel very sorry because I can't say anything." He then sat down. But after a pause, he stood up again and said, "If I have something to say, I will come again." Six months later, he telegraphed the principal, "Now I have something to say." So another banquet was held, and Einstein gave his speech.

Einstein spent his early years in Munich, where his father had run an unsuccessful electrical business. Einstein was not considered a bright student at that time. Like the first time he applied to a school in Zurich, the entrance exam completely failed. The school's rigid teaching methods and discipline did not resonate with Einstein's mind. The largest part of his knowledge came from self-study. At the age of twenty-six, he published the preliminary writings of the theory of relativity. After ten years of struggle and patience, he finally completed this world-renowned work—the theory of relativity—in 1915. (This article refers to E.Muller "Of Einstein")

Spring and Autumn

### Elegy of Life

— Ye Cao

A moonless winter night, without stars, utterly gloomy; the expansive plains of Guanghan are cold and desolate, swept by gust after gust of bone-chilling wind.

"Mr. Lü!"

Lying in bed, I faintly heard someone gently knocking on my door, calling me. In the pitch-black room, I opened my eyes. On a deep winter night, who would be visiting our school located in the suburbs? I suspected it was my imagination. A moment later, the door sounded again—

"Are you asleep, Mr. Lü!"

An inexplicable terror instantly filled my bedroom. The voice was undeniably real. I suddenly jumped out of bed, threw on my overcoat, and gripped my only weapon—a cane—preparing to resist a sudden misfortune! I shouted loudly:

"Who is it?"

"It's Old Zhang, Old Zhang."

It turned out to be the old servant of the Zhao family from the market, a voice I knew well. I put down my cane, lit the bean oil lamp, and let him in. I asked,

"What are you doing here at this hour, Old Zhang?"

"The master sent me to fetch you, asking you to come immediately," Old Zhang said, trembling, his expression unusually uneasy. "The young master has taken poison!"

"What?" I asked in astonishment.

"Just now, the young master took more than a hundred quinine pills!"

I started putting on my cotton pants and socks. Before I could even put on my overcoat, Old Zhang urged,

"Let's go, Mr. Lü."

Closing the door, I picked up my cane and followed Old Zhang, bypassing the classroom and exiting the school gate. It was very cold, and I shivered constantly. I reflexively turned up my overcoat collar, adjusted my scarf, and pulled down my ear flaps.

The night was pitch black, you couldn't see your teeth face to face. Unable to see the road, we proceeded as if lost in an endless hell, groping our way forward; passing through several groves of trees, circling around a cemetery, relying entirely on our sense of direction.

"I was too flustered when I left and forgot to bring a lantern."

Old Zhang muttered to himself, and I ignored him. I thought to myself: It's better not to bring one. If we brought one, it might be blown out by the wind and we wouldn't be able to relight it, which would be even more terrifying. On this road, as long as we don't bump into each other, we can't see anything anyway. I worried about tripping over the earthen embankment.

"Halt! Who goes there?"

The shout startled me!

"Civilians, returning home."

"Why are you returning home so late?"

"There is a sick person, we are fetching a doctor."

Old Zhang calmly dealt with the situation, and we were not detained. Old Zhang lied, though, as I am not a doctor! After passing this checkpoint, I had goosebumps all over. I asked Old Zhang:

"When did the troops arrive?"

"In the evening. I heard there was fighting not far away!"

Having entered the market town, I felt more at ease. Pushing open the Zhao family's gate, I didn't enter the main entrance. The old master was standing behind the gate, waiting for us, whispering in a humble tone—

"It's so late, and it's so cold outside. I really feel bad for asking Mr. Lü to come! Berko kept calling your name while he was unconscious; now, he's almost vomited up all the quinine, and he's awake, but he won't talk to anyone. It's wonderful that you've come! Please come to the back!"

I stepped into Berko's room and immediately sensed a tragic and rare atmosphere. Things were scattered everywhere, a large basin of charcoal fire was placed in the center, surrounded by fragments of quinine, water, paper, and vomit, with a medicinal smell! That young man with a pure heart—Berko—his hair disheveled, his face upturned, lay quietly on a small bed, his eyes closed, like a martyred priest. People stood around him, his mother's eyes already swollen from crying. Everyone's face showed sorrow and desolation, and I stood stunned to one side.

Berko gradually opened his eyes. His father told him I had arrived. He turned his eyes and looked, a smile appearing on his lips. I immediately ran over and shook his hand. He gripped my hand tightly.

"Everyone, leave!" he said suddenly in a painful tone.

"Berko," I patted him, "Am I included?"

"No, just you stay!"

His family quietly left, and I moved a stool and sat in front of his bed. He wanted to turn over to talk to me more easily, but I stopped him.

"We are all kind people. If I die, you will surely sympathize with me, and that will be enough for me," Berko said, shedding two tears. My eyes were also getting hot, and I couldn't help but shed tears as well.

"I have a few words that are almost stuck in my stomach. As I approach death, I want to tell you frankly, and you may find them valuable!"

"You won't die, don't always think nonsense!" I said.

"I feel there is no room for me in this world anymore!" He wiped away his tears. "Who am I living for? What am I living for? That's why I decided to walk down the road to death!"

"A person should broaden their horizons a little!"

"Listen to me. Twenty-seven years ago, I just graduated from high school and went to Wuhan with a few classmates. Unable to find a way out, we decided to go to the Northwest together to see the new things that were said to exist there. After staying there for more than a year, I often wrote articles and translated some small poems. For some reason, I began to be suspected. Later, because of intense activity, my brain was injured, and I wanted to go home for treatment. Unexpectedly, passing through a checkpoint, I was arrested. A friend of a relative spent a lot of effort to get me out. When I got home, I thought I would concentrate on recuperating, and after recovering, I would study behind closed doors, and I would never make any plans again!"

"Recuperation is important. Your illness can't be cured in a short period of time!"

"Yes. Give me a glass of boiled water, please," I poured him a glass of boiled water, and he continued, "It's also quite boring to just recuperate. A relative asked me to teach a few classes in his elementary school, so my life could be a little more regular. So I spent half a year with the children, and it felt quite comfortable. Who would have thought that during the winter vacation, someone would want me to talk in the city because of this. He asked me why I wanted to teach in a remote rural area. How do you think I could answer that?"

"What's so suspicious about teaching?"

"Some people naturally think it's suspicious to teach in the countryside. People will never understand my illness," Berko said with a wry smile. "There's even something more ridiculous. A friend actually wrote to me saying that I was depressed, as if deliberately trying to provoke me!"

"Why bother with him, let him say whatever he wants!" I took the opportunity to enlighten him.

"This is simply irrational. I have never participated in any party or organization in my life. What is there to be depressed about? He shouldn't provoke me like this. I can't stand it! Teaching elementary school in the countryside is also discriminated against. I believe that there is no place for me in this world anymore! What am I? Attacked from both sides! It's obvious that there is no room for me to survive! What am I living for? Who am I living for..."

He stopped speaking there. A mouthful of stuffy air blocked Berko's throat. He fainted, his breathing stopped, and only his eyes rolled back. I panicked. I shouted for his parents and stood blankly to one side.

The wind was very strong, and it was still pitch black outside.

### Watermill Cottage

— Hobbema

Hobbema (1638-1709) is a landscape painter famous in the Dutch school. His works are full of pleasant temperament. The colors are bright, and he pays special attention to perspective and the expression of the sky, which greatly influenced later British landscape painting. Even the Impressionism produced by France in the 19th century was inspired by him. Representative works include "Avenue at Middelharnis" and "The Water Mill," both of which are treasured in the Louvre Palace and listed in the history of fine arts. (Lion)

### Searching

— Yang Mou

The wilderness is lonely, and I keep my shadow company in solitude.

Like a lost lamb, I am searching for a road. Like a stray wild horse, I am searching for friends. The frail cries of my soul vibrate in my ears, but the universe is like a deep, deep sea. Although I always seem to be chasing what I am searching for, I still find it difficult to glimpse its trace.

Since I was a child, I have been afraid of calmly groping in the dark. I love light, I love joy, I love excitement, but when life asks you to endure endless pain, it is futile to escape.

Searching, searching, where is warmth? Where is the resting place for the soul?

Speaking such decadent and frustrated words, I myself estimate that I am too young. I am a young person, yes, that's right, I should have the courage to be reckless, but I am just tiptoeing around, sniffing at those shadows. My soul is aging, and it is also engraved with scars.

Do you want to cry? What's the use of crying? Crying can't drive away loneliness, and crying can't cleanse the ugliness of the world. I am willing to stand firm, no matter how dark the night, no matter how cold the wind, I am not willing to lower my head.

There is no road ahead, and there are no friends around. Is there anything more tragic and pitiful in the world than this? I am still searching, searching, searching, I have not abandoned the last bit of faith. Like a flame in a gale, if it is suddenly extinguished, what a dark situation it would be?

Thinking too much sometimes makes me smart, but sometimes it makes me more confused and stupid. There are many things in the world that I cannot imagine. I am afraid to think, and I dare not think. I only have a stupid idea: I want to find a road, I want to find friends. It would also be good if there is still a little warmth in the world, so that it can moisten a dry heart.

Stubbornly, I am still searching.

You are more awake than us all.

When I was still sleeping in the dark, entangled in nightmares, you had already quickly stepped out of the threshold of the night and flew to the fragrant dawn. Your song resounded clearly in the green forest.

The silvery dewdrops of the morning nourish your singing voice, and your silence comforts the lonely hearts of mankind. As long as your song rings in my ears, my heart will often be moved by excessive joy and gratitude.

In those days of hardship, I often regarded myself as a donkey, carrying the heavy burden of life and silently pushing the mill in a dark room, enduring the bitter whipping day and night, without singing, without laughter.

Today, and especially at this most peaceful moment when all the sins of mankind have died, I wake up, I hear you singing on the oak tree outside the window, and my heart feels especially tranquil.

I think this world should belong to you, to those who love the dawn!

### An Inch of Land, an Inch of Blood 150

— Ye Jingfeng

There is one thing about Japanese judo and kendo that can be greatly praised: that is, its universality! All islanders are enrolled in school, and elementary school courses include introductory judo and kendo. High school graduates who work hard can reach the level of three or four dans. Not only are their muscles and bones strong and their physiques solid, but even if they engage in a frontal assault and fight hand-to-hand with their opponents, they are quite able to cope calmly. If they feel a special interest in this field, there are also advanced specialized kendo schools where they can learn from masters and improve.

Looking back at our country, it is simply infuriating, pathetic, laughable, miserable, and hateful: in ordinary society, as soon as you mention boxing or martial arts, they pout their mouths and bare their teeth, as if other people are already using atomic bombs, and you are still talking about some mediocre skills; driving backwards to the primitive era! Some glib-tongued literati even use the currently slightly popular Taijiquan as a topic for jokes. But it's also not surprising, because anything, once it gets to Shanghai, has to change its nature, "oranges turn into trifoliate oranges"! If you don't believe me, just ask U.S. President Truman, make a deal, borrow an atomic bomb, move it to Shanghai, overnight, just overnight, this atomic bomb, wouldn't it turn into an "unatomic" and "unexploding" "solid iron shaft lightweight" thing?

The Taiji in Shanghai is all "lazy boxing" that has gone wrong, no wonder outsiders laugh at it. Is it really that there are not a few good players? There are, but they are all surrounded by gold bars! Even if you yearn for them and try every means, you can't even get through the door; if you want to learn one or two moves from him, you will be smoked out by gold bars before you can even enter. Society is unwilling to promote it, those with aspirations are unable to promote it, and the country can't manage it at the moment, so we can only let the Japanese universally strengthen and improve their judo and kendo.

Tsurumi picked up this old school sword and tried it. He was satisfied, and immediately bowed formally to Secretary Nishihara, saying, "Please convey my gratitude to the Prime Minister—urgent rectification—"! After saying this, he turned and stepped out of the Hyogo room. Just in this step, the brightly lit Beppu happened to become pitch black in an instant; all the lights went out.

"Huh"! Tsurumi was a little surprised, feeling that this step came too quickly.

Why too quickly? Because according to Tsurumi's original plan, he should have met a few people first at this time: the first person was originally Konoe, but now he doesn't need to see him; to see Konoe is to ask for instructions; although the focus of this evening's events is on Tsurumi, Konoe is the most important object, and the power of all possible actions must be requested from Konoe before action can be taken, in order to achieve the "changing the pillars" stage. Why doesn't he need to see Konoe now? Because Konoe has already issued the order of "urgent rectification," and the power conferred on Tsurumi is more urgent and serious than that requested, so of course there is no need to see Konoe again.

The second person to meet is the commander of the Beppu garrison. This garrison commander is the commander-in-chief of action in the event of an emergency in Beppu, with the power to command everything; all matters of defense, killing, arrest, and even summary execution are within the scope of his command. So why did Tsurumi want to meet him? It was to tell him that the person in charge tonight was Tsurumi himself, because he was the target of the enemy's challenge; and also to tell him that he had asked Konoe for instructions and should have command authority; if he didn't believe it, just ask; if he didn't obey, then let's compete first; anyway, there is no such thing as the "Green Field Society," Tsurumi can also spray him with a mouthful of bloody saliva after the killing, saying that he is the "Green Field" leader. If he obeyed, he would naturally listen to Tsurumi's command.

The third person to meet is very important, that is, the head of the Black Dragon Society in Beppu. This head may be a clerk, a gardener, or a toilet cleaner in other factions, but if something like tonight happens, he can become a potential commander-in-chief of action like the Monkey King, immediately transforming into a potential commander-in-chief of action; then pluck a handful of hairs, chew them in his mouth, and darken them in the air, and Beppu can immediately become the world of the Black Dragon Society party members; so Tsurumi has to say hello to this person, "We are all our own people". But Tsurumi only joined the Black Dragon Society three or two days ago, how can he know who is the head of the Black Dragon Society in Beppu? This is Yuanzi's job, she had already arranged it, and when the time came, she would naturally have a way to guide him, but this move is not important now; once the slogan of "urgent rectification" is released, the head of the Black Dragon Society will naturally identify himself.

### Setting the Format of Zhou Deqing's Short Lyric

— Zhao Jingshen

Zhou Deqing of the Yuan Dynasty attached a discussion on ten methods of composing lyrics in "Zhongyuan Rhymes." The tenth method is to set the format of short lyrics, setting various rules for short lyrics; the role of this part is almost equivalent to the "Baixiang Lyric Score" in lyrics. By reading his short lyric format thoroughly, when writing northern song short lyrics, you can avoid overstepping the rules.

However, I also have two dissatisfactions with this part: first, if the fixed format is designed for writing short lyrics, any brand names that are not used in short lyrics should not be included; and the more commonly used tunes in short lyrics should not be omitted. Second, since you have set the rules, you should abide by them yourself. Now, let's elaborate on these two points.

There are a total of thirty-six formats for short lyrics, not counting the four suites in Ma Zhiyuan's Double Tone Night Voyage. (There are three other songs that are already included in the thirty-six songs.) If this is set up for suites, then only the Double Tone is more detailed, and the rest are not detailed enough. Even with Double Tone, there is no first song, New Water Order, let alone others. So I still regard it as a fixed format for short lyrics, which is more appropriate. Among these thirty-six songs, I think that "Wild Goose" and "Golden Accord" in the Xian Lü mode, the Yuan people seem to have never used to write short lyrics, so they can be deleted. The following eighteen more commonly used should be added: Xian Lü's Backyard Flower, Green Brother and Wandering Four Doors, Zhong Lü's Upper Small Building, Happy Three, Splitting the Happiness of Spring and Chasing the Sky Music with Red Shirt, Southern Lü's Jade Delicate Branch, Dry Lotus Leaf and Reading the Golden Scripture, Zheng Palace's Muttering Order, Parrot Song and Taking Off the Cloth Shirt with Liangzhou, Double Tone's Step by Step, Standing Horse and Hu Eighteenth, as well as Yellow Hammer's Scraping the Wind and People in the Moon Circle. At the very least, Zhong Lü's Upper Small Building, Southern Lü's Reading the Golden Scripture, Zheng Palace's Muttering Order and Parrot Song must be added. According to Chen Naigan's "Collection of Yuan Dynasty Short Lyrics", we know that Guan Yunshi, Jing Yuanqi, Wang Jingfu, Zhang Kejiu, Ren Yu, Wu Renqing and others have written Upper Small Building; Ma Zhiyuan, Lu Zhi, Wu Renqing, Liu Bingzhong, Xianyu Biren, Guan Yunshi and twelve others have written Reading the Golden Scripture; Deng Yubin, Yang Chaoying, Zhou Wenzhi and others have written Muttering Order; Bai Shang, Feng Zizhen, Lü Jimin and others have written Parrot Song. It is a fact that Ju Deqing himself has never written these four songs, but he cannot think that they are unnecessary just because he has never written them.

Secondly, we know that Zhou Deqing himself has filled in eight kinds of short lyrics, and now let's "attack the shield with the spear of the son":

Wild Goose Hongqiu He said that the third sentence and the fourth word are valuable in the rising tone, "The sound turns from above, and the aim is at the head." But his own "Xunyang Scene" is the word "piece" in "Several pieces of Jiang Fan are as fast as arrows," which is the going tone, not the rising tone. The word "wine" in "Qinlou's beautiful wine adds a high price" is also the going tone. He also said that the last "word belongs to Yang is even better" in the fifth sentence, but unexpectedly the word "good" used by himself is also a dangerous flat, and the word "dew" is even the going tone. The first word of the last sentence should be flat, but he himself used the going tone words "Sai" and "Drunk".

Red Embroidered Shoes He advocated that the last three sentences should be paired, and named it the rescue tail pair. For example, Zhang Kejiu's Gui Xingyun: "Golden shame Zhuangshi, Rouge play beauty, Green Mountain attracts old hermits." Cai Xingfu's Suburban Residence Yun: "The fence is surrounded by water, the mountain is high outside the door, and the two cypresses in front of the court are old." But his own "Suburban Xing" three words are not obeyed: "Write a poem to Taoye Ferry, ask Xinghua Village, drunk and return donkey back stable." "Linshuang maple leaves dance, full wheat snowflakes, another year of autumn is over." "A few sounds of Sand Mouth Goose, a few points of tree head Crow, said Jiangshan haggard." Only the first two sentences are correct, the last sentence is not only incorrect, but also has one more word. The last sentence should be a flat upper, Jiangzi is flat, and it feels slightly inconsistent.

Happy Spring Comes He said: The last word of the first sentence "Go to the voice is good, never go to the rising tone." But his own "Spring Love" used a washing word, and "Parting Love" used a Willow word, all of which are in the rising tone. He also said: The third word of the second sentence, the last word of the fourth sentence "for Yang, wonderful." But his own "Spring Qing" second sentence uses the Yin Ping word "Bee", "Spring Late" second sentence uses the Yin Ping Chunzi, and the third sentence uses the Yin Ping Weaver word. The second sentence of "Parting Love" also uses the Yin Ping word "First".

Full Court Fragrance He said: The last word of the sixth sentence should be in the rising tone, "If it is in the flat tone, it is the second best". But his own "Yue Wang" made "Husband", and "Mistaken Country Qin Juniper" made "Jun", both of which used the flat tone.

Facing the Heavens He said: The aim is at the first word of the seventh sentence, which should be in the flat tone. His own "Autumn Night Guest Huai" uses the word "Knock", which is correct.

Drunk in the East Wind He said: The first word of the second sentence "belongs to the intestine, to start its sound, belongs to the aim." But in his own "Something to Remember" four songs, "Autumn" and "Swallow" are both Yin, and "Feng" and "Carp" are both rising tones, and not a single word is used in the Yang Ping. He also said: The first "two words of the third sentence are even more wonderful if they get the going and rising tones." But his own "Not Common" is the opposite of going up. The last two sentences are the same for four songs, all of which are: "Remember Jinggong's old day inscription: Where is there no fish soup rice to eat." The word "Old" should be on and off, and the word "None" should be on the flat, which does not conform to the rules set by himself. Only the word "None" is an idiom, which is forgivable.

Plucking Osmanthus He pays the most attention to the first two words of the sixth sentence, going up, and the last two words of the seventh sentence, going up. His own "Sending Guests to Wuchang" uses "Love between two places" in the sixth sentence. The two words "Two Places" happen to be the opposite of going up. The first word of the sixth sentence of "Parting Friends" uses "Poetry", which is a flat tone. The last word of the seventh sentence is "Lang", which is the going tone, all of which are inconsistent.

Sky Net Sand He said that the first three sentences are "the first three pairs" but his own "Mocking Singer Cha Cha" is: "Roots and rhizomes grow Lingya, flag halberds are erected fireworks, not allowed Feng Kui to string tiles." "Boat blocked Daughter Port" is: "Lushan noodles have been difficult to find, Gushan shoes have not sunk, covering the face and leaving shoes means deep." Only the first two sentences are correct, and the third sentence is not correct, and cannot complete the "tripod pair". The last two words of the third sentence should be on, and the word "Deep" are all flat tones.

Except for Facing the Heavens, none of the above is slapping his own mouth. Shen Yue's Eight Diseases himself cannot abide by, maybe that's how the creators are.
