### Seeking Ways to Resume Peace Talks, Formation of Government Under Discussion, Democratic Socialist Party Discusses Participation Yesterday

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 3rd] As the new year begins, the atmosphere for peace talks in the capital has become noticeably stronger. Lei Zhen, who was tasked with going to Shanghai to discuss government reorganization with various parties, returned to Nanjing on the morning of the 1st. After disembarking, he went directly to pay respects at the mausoleum, and in the morning, he paid his respects to Chairman Chiang, reporting on his trip to Shanghai. Afterwards, Lei gave a statement to reporters, saying that he had met with figures from the Democratic Socialist Party in Shanghai five or six times, achieving considerable progress, and had also had contact with the Democratic League, but without any concrete conclusions yet. The government is currently actively seeking ways to resume peace talks. The government reorganization is also expected to be implemented soon, and the original steps will still be followed, with various parties first submitting lists of names to reorganize the National Government Committee, then discussing methods for reorganizing various Yuan and Ministries. Zhang Qun remained in Shanghai when Lei returned to Nanjing, continuing to contact various parties. Sun Ke and Wu Tiecheng went to Shanghai on the evening of the 2nd, and Lei is also scheduled to go to Shanghai again on the 4th to continue his efforts. It is said that Zhang Junmai may come to Nanjing in the next few days, and Chen Qitian of the Youth Party also went to Shanghai on the 2nd, likely to hold a meeting in Shanghai to discuss everything. Furthermore, as the atmosphere for peace talks intensifies, Zhang Zhizhong, Chairman of Xinjiang Province, also flew to the capital on the 2nd. It is widely believed that this is related to the resumption of peace talks and the previously rumored government delegation to Yan'an. Zhang attended a banquet hosted by the Chairman on the afternoon of the 3rd, and Shao Lizi visited him in the afternoon. Later, Zhang visited Wang Shijie and Shao Lizi separately. According to official statements, Zhang's visit to Nanjing is solely for reporting on his duties. Also, Shao Lizi visited Dong Biwu again on the afternoon of the 2nd for a long conversation. Shao stated that it was "merely a New Year's greeting."

[Central News Agency Dispatch from This City] The Organization Committee of the Democratic Socialist Party held a meeting in Shanghai at 3:00 PM on the 3rd. More than 40 members of the party's Central Standing Committee attended, with Zhang Junmai serving as chairman. During the meeting, it was decided to expand the party's organization to accommodate the participation of people from all sectors, and Li Daming, Lu Guangsheng, Yi Qiao, Zai Shiming, Wan Renqian, and Hu Haimen were newly elected as members of the Central Standing Committee. Liang Qiushui was also regularly elected, but he has declined the position. The attending committee members also had a heated discussion on the issue of participating in the government, but no conclusion was reached. The meeting adjourned at 7:00 PM.

[Another Dispatch] Xu Fulin, Chairman of the Democratic Socialist Party's delegation to the National Assembly, made a statement yesterday regarding the party's participation in the government, saying: "I am not opposed to participating in the government, but whether or not to participate must depend on the following two prerequisites: (1) What method will be used to reorganize the government so as to accommodate representatives from all parties and factions; (2) Who will be responsible for reorganizing the government? The choice of Premier is extremely important and must be carefully selected so that he can be well-respected and bring a fresh perspective." Xu stated: "The government should invite the CCP and the Democratic League to participate, showing the government's magnanimity and inclusiveness of the whole country. Participating in the government is doing things for the country and for the people, who can refuse to participate?" He also believes that the constitution has already been promulgated and no one can change it. If there are any problems with the constitution, it should be amended by the National Assembly.

### Constitutional Government Promotion Association to be Established This Month, Chairman to Serve Concurrently as President, Headquarters to be in the Capital, Branches in Provinces and Cities

### U.S. Military Court in Beiping to Begin Trial Soon, Beiping Police Bureau to Send Personnel to Participate in Jury

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 3rd] After the Beiping students marched to protest the rape of a Peking University female student by a U.S. soldier, they also formed the "Beiping Universities United Association Against Atrocities" and planned to submit six documents: (1) A letter to Chairman Chiang; (2) A letter to Marshall, forwarded to Truman; (3) A letter to all compatriots in the country; (4) A letter to all students in the country; (5) A letter to the American people and students; (6) A letter to U.S. military personnel stationed in China. According to Ms. Zuo Mingche, Director of the Foreign Affairs Office of the Beiping Municipal Government, the U.S. side will set up a court to begin the trial in the near future, and the Beiping Police Bureau will send representatives to participate in the jury. Also, U.S. professors at Tsinghua University, dissatisfied with the slogan "Americans Go Home" written by students outside their dormitories, jointly went on strike, and the school is trying to mediate.

Statement by the Ambassador

[United States Information Service, Nanjing, 3rd] U.S. Ambassador to China Dr. John Leighton Stuart issued the following statement last night to the students who held demonstrations here protesting the so-called rape of a female student in Beiping: "Regarding this incident, the Beiping Marine Corps authorities are conducting a thorough investigation. If the investigation reveals criminal behavior, a court-martial will be held as soon as possible in accordance with normal military procedures. We are proceeding with this case as quickly as possible within the scope permitted by a fair and democratic trial. We have not yet received further reports from Beiping, and we are now awaiting the full report of the investigation."

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 3rd] Students in the capital continued their demonstrations this afternoon protesting the rape of a female student by U.S. troops in Beiping. Nearly a thousand people gathered, distributing leaflets and posting slogans along the way. At 5:00 PM, they went to the U.S. Embassy to meet with Ambassador Stuart. Five student representatives entered and presented three demands to the Ambassador: (1) Punish the perpetrators; (2) The parties involved must apologize to all of China; (3) U.S. troops stationed in China must withdraw. The Ambassador replied with the utmost sincerity: Regarding the above three points, I will consider them and report them to the U.S. government. He also said that he has spent half his life in China and is very concerned about China. He not only sympathizes with but also supports your rational patriotic movement. I have been with young people in China, and I am very happy to see you now. After speaking, the student representatives withdrew.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 3rd] The Nanjing University Committee to Protest U.S. Military Atrocities and Demand the Immediate Withdrawal of U.S. Troops from China held a press conference at 8:00 PM on the 3rd to report on the march. Guo Hengqu, Guo Qixiong, and others were responsible for answering questions from reporters. Their main opinion was that the illegal behavior of U.S. troops in Beiping this time was only one of the "atrocities." To eliminate "atrocities," U.S. troops must leave China. At the same time, they believe that even if this incident is reasonably resolved as a personal matter, they will still insist on the goal of U.S. troops leaving China. At that time, reporters asked whether they would take the same attitude towards the Soviet army stationed in China besides the US army and what they thought of the Xiaosha River incident, but they were unable to answer. However, they always insisted that U.S. troops must withdraw, believing that the presence of U.S. troops in China hinders our country's unification. Someone asked whether this included Special Envoy Marshall and the U.S. military delegation? They only said that they did not know what the opinions of all the students were. The press conference ended amidst reporters' inquiries and inability to answer. The Student Union will continue to hold meetings on the 4th to discuss everything, and the actions of the march will be determined based on the situation.

### Canadian Businessman Prepares to Invest in Building a Hydropower Plant in Guangdong, Project Implementation Will Destroy Six Villages

[United Press International, Hong Kong, 3rd] According to Chinese newspapers citing the Director of the Guangdong Construction Department, the Chinese government is currently negotiating with a Canadian businessman to invest US$24 million in building a hydropower plant on the Wengjiang River, a tributary of the Beijiang River in Guangdong Province.

Construction is expected to begin after the end of the rainy season this spring.

### U.S. Military in North China Begins to Withdraw, First Batch of Officers and Soldiers Leaving China Number Approximately 4,000

[United Press International, Beiping, 3rd] The first batch of the U.S. Marine Corps in North China began to withdraw today. All officers and soldiers of the 7th Regiment stationed in Beidaihe and Qinhuangdao have boarded three U.S. Navy transport ships moored in Qinhuangdao Harbor and are scheduled to sail to San Diego, California, within 48 hours. Marine Corps officers and soldiers in other parts of China whose overseas service has expired have been transferred to the 7th Regiment in preparation for boarding. As for the officers and soldiers in the 7th Regiment whose service has not yet expired, they have been transferred to other Marine Corps units in various locations. Although the U.S. Marine Corps returning home this time is said to number 4,600, qualified observers believe that a figure of 3,000 is more realistic.

[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 3rd] The U.S. military here announced that Lieutenant General Dunagan, Commander of the Marine Corps in the Pacific Area, will travel from Hawaii to China to inspect the situation of the U.S. Navy stationed in China. His first visit in China will be to Qingdao, on the 9th.

[United Press International, Boston, 2nd] Retired U.S. Army Colonel Dupuy, who served as an Army Liaison Officer during the war and has written extensively on world issues, recently wrote in the Christian Science Monitor: "The purpose of the U.S. military stationed in China is to maintain a stabilizing force and to provide the Soviet Union with a direct reminder that the United States does not want China to become a vassal state of the Soviet Union." Dupuy acknowledged that the presence of U.S. troops in China is not an ideal situation, but insisted that the U.S. military needs to continue to be stationed in China. "Some believe that the U.S. military is leaning towards the National Government? This is a fact, but the reason why the United States leans towards the National Government is for the sake of American interests, and does not want the currently legitimate Chinese government to be replaced by a worse political system. If the U.S. military withdraws, the government will have to protect these areas with a large number of troops, which will inevitably lead to a more intense civil war." Dupuy also said: "Some may ask why the Communist army does not launch a full-scale offensive against our weak forces in the above-mentioned areas. The only answer is that the Soviet Union has not yet allowed it to do so, otherwise it would have launched the offensive long ago. The reason why the Soviet Union has not yet allowed it is because it fears that China will become the origin of World War III. It must be known that the Chinese Communist Party, like the Communist parties in other parts of the world, is under the command of Moscow. Today's situation in China is not a dispute between two political parties, but a clash of two ideologies."

### Full Text of the Chairman's New Year's Day Address

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 1st] The full text of Chairman Chiang's New Year's Day address is as follows:

Fellow Comrades,

Since the National Government returned to the capital, today is the first New Year's Day. I and my civil and military colleagues gather together to celebrate the founding of the Republic of China and the formal promulgation of the Constitution of the Republic of China. Thinking about the step-by-step progress of our nation-building work, we can comfort the spirit of the Founding Father, which is really filled with joy and excitement. After this promulgation of the Constitution, we must, according to the preparation procedures decided by the National Assembly, step up preparations and implement them as scheduled. We must actively ensure the rights and freedoms of the people, separately repeal or amend existing laws and regulations that conflict with the Constitution, and initially formulate various election laws and organizational laws. What is especially important is to effectively relieve the suffering of the people during this transition period and promote post-war construction and reconstruction. The responsibility of our government is really doubly heavy. You have devoted yourselves to your duties and worked diligently throughout the year. I want to take this opportunity to express my gratitude and condolences. At the same time, we must review the current state of the country, examine our own responsibilities, and look forward to the arduous tasks ahead. I would like to share the motto of "daily renewal and improvement" with all of you to encourage each other.

On this day last year, when I broadcasted to the people of the whole country, I explained that the most urgent task of the country at present is nothing more than stability and recovery. Only by eliminating the phenomena of turmoil and division within the country and the factors of disturbance and dispute can the work of demobilization and construction proceed smoothly. I also explained that the focus of our efforts is "national unification" and "political democracy." The five agreements on "nationalization of the army" and "democratization of politics" reached at the Political Consultative Conference in January last year, and the signing of the plan to restore transportation and reorganize the army in February, were all based on this spirit. Unfortunately, as soon as the agreements were reached, turmoil arose one after another. The actions of armed factions not only hindered the work of national recovery, but also threatened domestic peace and security. The people suffered displacement, transportation suffered destruction, local areas were not peaceful, and construction could not proceed, leading to economic imbalance and stagnation of production. The phenomenon of high prices and difficult lives was even more widespread throughout the country, harming society. We knew that there would be many difficulties after the end of the war, but we never thought that we would suffer such serious setbacks. Today, I review the past year. The policy of peaceful unification has not been implemented, and the work of demobilization and rehabilitation has not been completed. I am deeply saddened by the relatives of the martyrs who bravely sacrificed themselves in the war of resistance against Japan, the displaced and hungry compatriots in various places, the armed forces who shared weal and woe, and the public and education personnel who are struggling to make a living. The government will do its best to perform its duties, find ways to remedy the situation, and relieve the suffering of our compatriots and colleagues. At the same time, I hope that leaders at all levels will encourage their subordinates to endure hardship and not be afraid of difficulties, thoroughly implement the original intention of the wartime period, and renew our politics at all levels so that the great cause of nation-building can be completed.

Observing the most heartbreaking phenomenon in the past year, it is the fading of the understanding of the War of Resistance. Looking back to when our War of Resistance began, how vigorously and unreservedly did everyone act? During the War of Resistance, how loyally, bravely, and steadfastly did everyone act, forgetting their families for the sake of the country? In the most difficult and dangerous times when the enemy's aggression and oppression were the deepest, did everyone not have the spirit of fighting the enemy together and disregarding their own safety? Please recall the mood at that time. Did everyone not say unanimously that as long as the War of Resistance is victorious and our country and nation achieve glory, personal sacrifices are not worth considering, and we are willing to endure all difficulties and pain? But now, not long after the victory of the War of Resistance, the bones of the fallen soldiers are not yet cold, and the general social psychology seems to have gradually forgotten the heroic War of Resistance that we sacrificed so much for, and has put the dangers and difficulties of our country at that time, as well as our own vows of burning our boats at that time, behind us. Some think that once the war stops, they should restore all the enjoyment they had before the war. Some think that after eight years of tension, they should relax now. Some think that during the war we contributed our freedom to the country, and today the country should immediately reward us. Because of these kinds of psychology, there are those who procrastinate and are negligent, those who are self-defeating, those who complain about heaven and earth, and those who speculate and take advantage of opportunities. Such a lack of emphasis on the sacredness of our War of Resistance, a lack of understanding of the inevitability of post-war hardship, and even more, a lack of recognition of the extreme value of the fruits of the War of Resistance, and the need to maintain them, can be said to be unrighteous to the fallen soldiers and disloyal to the country and nation. I believe that this kind of wrong concept and attitude must be corrected. Our civil servants, who have dedicated themselves to the country and suffered hardships, should, of course, implement the original intention of the wartime period and not forget the hardships of the wartime period. Even more, they should lead by example and awaken their compatriots. They should make all compatriots in the country frugal to commemorate the War of Resistance, work hard to commemorate the War of Resistance, and be especially diligent to maintain the victory of the War of Resistance and promote the fruits of the War of Resistance. For this war-torn and still breathing country, everyone in the country should be of one mind and one heart, and fully protect it. We must emulate the actions of our allies such as Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union. Look at how they are saving money and working hard day and night today after the war, how they are sacrificing their own small selves and contributing to the country, and how they are uniting the country and sharing weal and woe. China is far inferior to others in many ways, so how should we catch up quickly and contribute all our strength to the sacred cause of recovery and nation-building, so as not to be ashamed of the military and civilian martyrs who sacrificed themselves in the War of Resistance? This is the first point that I hope everyone will do their best to reverse the decline. (The following text continues on page 2)

### National Army in Southern Hebei Recovers Daming; Communist Forces Abandon Liaocheng, Shandong, After a Year-Long Siege; Communist Regiment Attacks Jinxiang, Enduring Five Days and Nights of Bloody Battle

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 3rd] Military sources here confirm that the 85th Division of the National Army recovered Daming on the same day (1st) that the Communist forces in Western Shandong captured Liaocheng. The Communist forces are said to have retreated to the northeast and northwest.

[Our Newspaper, Jinan, 22nd] After a year of arduous defense, the military and civilians of Liaocheng voluntarily abandoned the city on the 1st. The Communist forces besieging Liaocheng were ambushed on December 18th by forces dispatched by Commander Wang Jinxiang and the defending troops within the city. Unable to withstand the attack, the main force of the Communist forces retreated to the northeast of the city, but soon reinforcements arrived and counterattacked the city. Commander Wang then dispatched elite troops overnight to provide support. Considering that the city was deep in the heart of the Communist-occupied area, and resupply was difficult, there was no need to hold it. On the morning of the 1st, after the reinforcements arrived in the suburbs, they covered the retreat of over ten thousand soldiers and civilians within the city, fighting as they retreated. By noon on the 1st, they had safely arrived in a secure area in Western Shandong to await orders. The city had been besieged since January 2nd of last year and was evacuated on January 1st of this year, exactly one year. Compatriots from Liaocheng in Jinan, upon hearing the news on the 2nd, specially requested Commander Wang to organize and train an armed home guard to fight back to their hometown.

[Our Newspaper, Jinan, 3rd] After Wang Jinxiang's troops withdrew from Liaocheng, they continued to operate in conjunction with the National Army. All government personnel, students, and refugees from the various counties in Western Shandong traveled together. On the 1st, they passed Dongxiu and were suddenly attacked by over a thousand Communist troops, who were repelled. On the 2nd, they passed Ershilipu and engaged in a fierce battle with 5,000 men of the 13th Column of the Communist forces, again repelling the Communist forces and killing or wounding over 3,000 Communist soldiers, completing their mission. Wang's troops stayed in Yucheng on the 2nd, arrived in Qibu on the 3rd, and are expected to reach Jinan on the 4th. All sectors here are preparing a grand welcome and慰劳.

[Our Newspaper, Chuzhou, 3rd] Over ten thousand troops under Yang Yong of the Communist forces in Southwestern Shandong captured Juye County on the 2nd and are besieging Jinxiang, having engaged in five days and nights of bloody battle. The morale of the defending troops is extremely high. Furthermore, Jiaxiang is also in a state of emergency.

[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 3rd] Communist forces in Linyi are coordinating with the Communist forces in Western Shandong to create disturbances, launching an attack on the National Army positions west and south of the city on the morning of the 3rd. Fierce fighting is currently underway.

[Central News Agency, Baoding, 3rd] The 79th Division of the Communist forces under Fan Xixian, along with over a thousand men from the Anxin County Brigade, emerged from Guojiaqiao, twenty miles east of Baoding, and infiltrated the Yucheng Village area, attempting to attack the National Army strongholds east of Baoding. Furthermore, over three thousand men from the 385th Brigade of the Communist forces emerged from Rongcheng on the night of the 1st and infiltrated Wuzhuang and Shaozhuang east of Xushui, with unclear intentions.

[Central News Agency, Zhenjiang, 1st] Since the National Army recovered, they have continued to pursue the remnants of the defeated Communists. On the morning of the 1st, they advanced from Tianzichang near Dongkan Town, attacking. The Communist forces fought and retreated. After fierce fighting until 5:00 PM, the National Army recovered Dongkan Town. The remnants of the Communist forces fled towards Daxiaoliuzhuang. Another unit of the National Army advanced from the northwest of Funing towards Beishalong, recovering Beishatianhu at 2:00 PM on the 1st.

### We Use Salt to Aid Japan and Korea; The Production of Changlu Salt This Year May Reach 15 Million Dan; The China Salt Industry Corporation of the Ministry of Finance Established in Tianjin

[Our Newspaper, Tianjin, 2nd] Before the recovery of Huai Salt, Changlu was the only major salt-producing area in the country. By the end of the 35th year, the Changlu area had a total of 8 million dan of salt in storage. In the 36th year, 4 million dan will be shipped to Japan, 500,000 dan to Korea, 2.5 million dan will be sold domestically, and the remainder will be shipped to Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Anhui, and along the Yangtze River to compensate for the shortage of Huai Salt and to supply industrial needs. The planned salt production for the 36th year is 13 million dan, but the actual target is 15 million dan.

[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 3rd] The China Salt Industry Corporation of the Ministry of Finance has been established here. The corporation was formed by merging the assets of the puppet North China Salt Industry Corporation and the Hangu and Dagu salt fields and factories. General Manager Yao Yuanlun stated that 380,000 tons of salt will be produced in the 36th year, which will be used to supply the domestic market and export to Japan and Korea.

[Central News Agency, Fuzhou, 3rd] Due to a large increase in production during the war, there is a large surplus of Fujian salt. Last year, the actual production was over 900,000 dan, and over 3 million dan were sold. Currently, there are still 3 million dan in storage. The plan for this year is to increase production by 1 million dan. In addition to domestic sales, it is planned to ship 1.5 million dan to Japan, 780,000 dan to Jiangxi, and 400,000 dan to Hubei. If transportation is smooth, exports can be increased further.

[Central News Agency, Qingdao, 3rd] The coastal areas of the Shandong Peninsula produce a large amount of salt. At the beginning of the new year, a large surplus will be shipped to Japan and Korea in exchange for materials and goods needed by our country, and will also be distributed to sales areas such as Hunan and Hubei to regulate the people's food supply. The Shandong Provincial Bureau is currently working on repairing the Qingdao salt pier, reorganizing the salt fields destroyed by the Chinese Communists, improving the roads in the salt fields, well sites, pond beaches, and field areas, strengthening anti-smuggling efforts, and assisting in the production of salt.

### The Future of Steel Production in the Northeast Is Optimistic

Sun Yueqi Returns South After Completing Investigation

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 3rd] Sun Yueqi, Deputy Director of the Resources Committee, left Ping by plane for Shanghai at 9:00 AM today to report to Premier Song on the results of his inspection of steel production in the Northeast. According to Sun, he was ordered by Premier Song to go to the Northeast to investigate whether steel production could offset a portion of foreign exchange. The results of the investigation were quite good. In the Anshan area alone, production in the next year can offset US$30 million in debt. Sun is extremely optimistic about the future of steel production in the Northeast, saying that most steel production departments have been reorganized. The most important Anshan Iron and Steel Plant will begin producing steel products in March, steelmaking can begin in June, and the 400-ton and 600-ton iron-smelting furnaces will also begin producing iron in September. This large-scale steel production can offset a portion of foreign exchange. He finally stated that the key to the industrial revival of the Northeast lies in the improvement of transportation.

### The Communist Bandit's Discrimination Against Chinese Merchants is Intensifying; The Definition of "Public Places" is Very Broad; Overseas Chinese Retailers Will Have No Place to Stand

[Central News Agency, Manila, 2nd] All overseas Chinese retailers may face the same fate as overseas Chinese vendors. Recently, the Philippine Department of Finance stipulated that the so-called public market should refer to any type of location or building designated by the City Council, County Council, or Municipal Authority, and should refer to any place or goods where any goods are sold in the public market. The above interpretation was given by the Philippine Department of Finance in response to complaints from overseas Chinese merchants against a certain city council. The council deprived them of the right to bid for stalls, citing Article 37 of the Republic Act of the Philippines, which stipulates that Filipinos who bid have priority over foreigners. In the provinces of Sorsogon and Marinduque, some Chinese-owned shops outside public markets have already been ordered to close when the Filipinization of Markets Act comes into effect. Local overseas Chinese are expressing concern, believing that if the definition of such conditions is so broad, all overseas Chinese retailers will face the same fate as the overseas Chinese vendors who are currently facing it.

[Associated Press, Manila, 2nd] City Treasurer Salmingo announced today that the municipal authorities are proceeding with the plan to redistribute the stalls in the public market, regardless of the court order to stop the crackdown on overseas Chinese vendors. These stalls will be allocated to Filipinos, but the actual implementation is pending a court decision. The Secretary of Finance will respond on the 7th of this month to the petition of overseas Chinese vendors who do not want to be illegally cracked down on, but overseas Chinese vendors in public markets in other cities in the Philippines are gradually closing down. Mayor of Bacolod and Administrator of the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration Gaston have also ordered local overseas Chinese merchants to sell their milk stocks, which are considered domestic goods, and warned that if they do not voluntarily sell them in the market, the government will take drastic measures to force them to sell.

### Our Country Establishes Commercial Institutions in Singapore

Promote Trade with Malaya and the Dutch East Indies

[Central News Agency, Singapore, 3rd] Li Zhifu, our Commercial Commissioner to Singapore, told a Central News Agency reporter on the 3rd that Malaya and the Dutch East Indies are both areas under his jurisdiction. The main purpose of establishing this commercial institution in Singapore is to promote trade between our country and Malaya and the Dutch East Indies, and to help develop the business of overseas Chinese in Malaya. He is very optimistic about the position of domestic goods in the Malayan market, saying that the exchange rate between our country's legal tender and the Straits Settlements currency is a favorable factor in encouraging the export of our country's goods to Malaya. The restriction on the export of cotton yarn has had a negative impact on the textile industry and indirectly affected the export of cloth to overseas markets, so he has suggested to the Ministry of Economic Affairs to relax the restrictions on cotton yarn exports.

### Ma Zhanshan Receives Overseas Chinese Leaders, Urges Overseas Chinese to Develop the Northeast

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 3rd] Ma Zhanshan, the hero of the September 18th Anti-Japanese War and the current Deputy Commander of the Northeast Security, in order to promote the development of the Northeast by overseas Chinese, hosted a reception at the Ministry of National Defense at 2:00 PM on the 3rd in his capacity as the Chairman of the Northeast Branch of the China Production Promotion and Guidance Committee, along with Mao Qingxiang, the Chairman of the Committee, and over sixty overseas Chinese leaders and journalists from North and South America, Southeast Asia, and Europe, including Situ Meitang. General Ma first stood up and gave a speech, describing his relationship with overseas Chinese, which was established as far back as the September 18th Anti-Japanese War, and explained that the Northeast is rich in resources and has an important strategic position. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the country was restored, and it is urgent to start operations to build a new China and establish peace in the Far East. However, the development of the Northeast relies on the enthusiastic operation of overseas Chinese. Overseas Chinese are discriminated against overseas. Why not invest their financial resources, technology, and entrepreneurial spirit in the motherland? This will not only be sincerely welcomed by the people of the Northeast, but it is believed that the government will also do its best to provide preferential treatment and protection. Chairman Mao then gave a speech, welcoming overseas Chinese to go to the Northeast to jointly engage in development and construction work, and the government and the Guidance Committee will do their best to assist them. The overseas Chinese leaders present also spoke one after another, expressing their willingness to return to their homeland to engage in the construction of the new China and hoping that the government would do its best to provide them with rewards and protection.

### Naval Fleet Tours the South, Arrives in Guangzhou to Host Journalists

[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 3rd] The naval fleet recently toured the south and arrived in Guangzhou. Lin Zun, the commander of the fleet, hosted a visit for journalists on the 3rd on the "Taiping" warship, which was anchored on the Pearl River, and explained the various departments on the ship in detail.

### The American Medical Aid to China Association Plans to Promote Medical Education in Our Country; Five Medical Colleges Can Receive Assistance; Liu Heng Talks About the American Medical Situation

[Central News Agency, New York, 3rd] Liu Ruiheng, President of the American Medical Aid to China Association and person in charge of the medical section of the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, recently arrived here from Shanghai. It is said that the American Medical Aid to China Association initiated a three-year plan to assist China in promoting medical education, starting this year. The first year requires US$1,375,000, and Liu is the person in charge of this three-year plan. He said at a press conference today that the American Medical Aid to China Association will assist five or six Chinese medical colleges so that their graduates can receive scholarships and enter American research institutes to continue their studies for one year. After they return to their country, they can serve at their alma mater. To date, the Chinese medical colleges that can receive this assistance include: (1) National Shanghai Medical College, (2) National Central University Medical College, (3) National Peking University Medical College, (4) National Xiangya Medical College, (5) National Sun Yat-sen University Medical College. The American Medical Aid to China's three-year plan also includes hiring American professors to teach at the above-mentioned schools, and in order to improve the standards of these medical colleges to be equal to the best medical colleges in the United States, it has been decided to donate laboratory and teaching equipment to the above-mentioned medical colleges. Liu said that the above-mentioned national medical colleges will become the core of Chinese medical education, and each school will also be affiliated with specialized schools for medicine, dentistry, nursing, obstetrics, and pharmacy.

[Associated Press, New York, 3rd] Liu Ruiheng, Director of the Medical and Health Department of the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, declared here today that China is studying the progress of Soviet medicine in the past 25 years, and hopes that such progress can also be seen in China in the next 30 years. Liu stated here, "Please do not misunderstand that I belong to the Communist Party." China is investigating Soviet medicine and health, nothing more than wanting to adopt its methods to create a large number of doctors and a large number of medical equipment. Chinese hospitals and health institutions are insufficient in both quality and quantity, and UNRRA assistance is just a drop in the bucket. The first penicillin manufacturing plant purchased by China in the United States has been shipped to Beiping and started operations on the 1st of this month, and can produce 100 small bottles of penicillin per day.

### Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration Air Transport Corps, American Personnel Come to China

The company, named the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration Air Transport Corps, will work closely with the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration to distribute food, clothing, and other supplies.

### The Issue of Japanese and Dutch Transport to China Can Still Be Reopened for Negotiations

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 3rd Special Dispatch] Officials of the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers (SCAP) in Japan informed the Chinese government authorities a few days ago that the issue of transporting Japanese cocoons to China can still be reopened for negotiations. China, through the China Corporation, requested the transportation of 10 million pounds of silkworm cocoons from Japan to China last summer, which was rejected by SCAP. Two weeks ago, the American side contacted our government liaison authorities and inquired whether SCAP's decision to reject our country's request for Japanese silk was final. SCAP officials conducted some research on this matter and declared that it had not been formally concluded. SCAP is very interested in Japanese silk because it is a major import from Japan to the United States. SCAP is deeply concerned about the high cost of occupying Japan, so it can only be compensated by Japanese exports that the United States needs, and silk is the most important of Japanese exports. Recently, due to rising prices and competition from American rayon, the sales of this Japanese silk in the United States have been sluggish again.

### Tianjin's Commodity Tax Revenue Last Year

Exceeded the Budget by More Than 5 Billion

[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 3rd] Tianjin's commodity tax revenue for the 35th year exceeded the budget by more than 5 billion yuan. This achievement in a depressed social economy fully demonstrates the enthusiasm of merchants to pay taxes. The main aspects of being able to eliminate embezzlement are also the main factors that enable tax revenue to be abundant. The budget for Tianjin's commodity tax collection in the 35th year was more than 18 billion yuan, and the actual collection was more than 24 billion yuan. The budget for the 36th year is still being approved by the central government.

### Two of Our Country's Merchant Ships Have Been Found in Japan

SCAP has ordered the Japanese government to report the details of the two ships in a memorandum. The two ships were salvaged by the Japanese in 1931.

### Hankou Celebrates the New Year, Journalists Beaten and Injured

[Our Newspaper, Hankou, 3rd] All sectors here have been holding lantern parades night after night to celebrate the New Year and the successful adoption of the constitution. However, amidst the cheers, two unfortunate incidents occurred in the new market one after another. One was after the New Year's Day celebration, when three thugs suddenly beat and injured Liu Ronghua, a journalist from the New Hubei Daily. One of the culprits, Zhang Jingtang, was found by the police today, but the cause of the incident is unknown, and the Journalists Association is still silent. Another incident was that a group of soldiers asked to enter the theater for free to watch the show yesterday afternoon, but they were stopped by the military police, and a dispute broke out between the two sides. While they were arguing, someone suddenly fired a shot from the fourth floor of the theater to show off, killing Pan Zesheng, a communications soldier passing by. The order was in chaos for a while, and the military police rushed to the scene and immediately imposed martial law and searched, but as of this morning, the culprit has not yet been caught.

### Yoshiko Kawashima's Confession: Full of Absurdity, Incomprehensible

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 3rd] The confession of female spy Yoshiko Kawashima, drafted and presented to the court, is full of absurdity. She claims that her biological father, Prince Su, went into exile overseas to rescue the Kuomintang. And said: She had thought several times about going to Chongqing but lacked acquaintances. She cited fourteen points to prove that her adoptive father, Naniwa Kawashima, was in favor of Chairman Chiang, her brother Su Bingwen, once served as commander of the Dingguo Army and the Protecting the Country Army, and had no contact with the enemy and hated the enemy. The broadcasts and articles in Tokyo, Osaka and other places were all launched for no reason. Operating the China Gold Mining Company was to confront the operation of the Japanese army. Serving in the "Manchuria Compatriots Association" was to protect the bereaved families of anti-Japanese soldiers. She denied that she had served as the "Director of the Manchurian Imperial Palace Women's Officials" and admitted that she had served as the Commander-in-Chief of the People's Self-Defense Army.

### Full Text of the Chairman's New Year's Address (Continued from Page One)

Secondly, I hope that our civil servants will establish a clean, efficient, and progressive political party. In recent years, foreign public opinion has often had extremely harsh criticisms of Chinese politics. Their general perception of our officials is described in four words: first, that they are corrupt; second, that they are incompetent; third, that they are selfish; and fourth, that they are dissolute. These views spread and are widely adopted, even influencing domestic public opinion. Such malicious propaganda initially came from those with ulterior motives, with the intention of making the people lose faith in our government, so as to achieve their sinister goals of harming the country and the people. In reality, the vast majority of our civil servants, since the War of Resistance, have endured meager salaries, taken on heavy workloads, endured hunger and cold, risked danger, and steadfastly held their posts, conscientiously fulfilling their duties. Their contributions to the country are without a doubt praiseworthy. However, the principal officials of our governments at all levels must thoroughly reflect and conduct self-examination, because there are always a few bad apples in any profession or department. If there is even one person in our government who is corrupt or incompetent and fails to fulfill their duties, it is enough to affect the reputation of all our officials. Our War of Resistance has been so long, and the treatment of civil servants has been so poor, that it is naturally impossible for everyone to concentrate on their duties and avoid any negligence. Especially at the grassroots level, where the scope is broad and the number of people is large, any laxity in supervision makes it impossible to completely prevent corrupt practices. The government has already established various regulations for disciplinary action and punishment for those who are corrupt, derelict in their duties, and those who abuse their position. We hope that the supervisory and judicial organs will exercise their powers, strictly investigate and prosecute, and that the heads of all agencies will also personally supervise and actively report such cases. Now that the Constitution has been promulgated and constitutional government is about to be implemented, in order to reform politics and benefit the people's livelihood, we should transform our political atmosphere and improve our administrative efficiency to promote the completion of the national reconstruction. I believe that corruption and law-breaking must be severely punished, and dissolute living should be eradicated. However, the necessary conditions for performing our official duties are not only to be clean but also to be capable, not only to have an upright life but also to dedicate oneself to public service. Being dilatory and inefficient is certainly not enough, and being distracted, and engaging in favoritism or abusing power is also not enough. Therefore, I hope that our supervisors at all levels will encourage all civil servants to study diligently, conduct research diligently, strive for progress, and know shame and self-improvement. We must recognize that more than a year has passed since the victory of the War of Resistance, and the progress of national reconstruction cannot be delayed any longer. We must not be discouraged by the current difficulties of the country and the heavy burden of life. As long as we are in office, we must be satisfied with our duties every day. We must take advantage of this New Year to boost our confidence, set our determination to reform corruption, improve personnel matters, eliminate the shame of corruption, incompetence, and selfishness that our politics has suffered, and establish a clean, progressive, responsible, and selfless new political style.

Comrades, many of our policy plans for the past year have not achieved expectations. This is certainly due to the difficulties of recovery and various external obstacles. However, overall, our main political measures are gradually approaching the success of national reconstruction. The Founding Father Sun Yat-sen often said: "Building a house cannot be done suddenly, and neither can building a country. We must have an extremely firm spirit and proceed with the greatest patience." Our country, after this war, has a lot of things to revive, and domestic peace and order have not yet been restored. The people are suffering and urgently need relief. The responsibilities of the government colleagues are indeed extraordinarily heavy. I hope that everyone will work together with one heart and one mind. For my own personal shortcomings, I especially hope that you will point them out and provide assistance, so that our country's politics can be renewed day by day and move forward with the times, to fulfill our mission of implementing the Three Principles of the People and building the nation through revolution. I wish all my colleagues a happy New Year. (The End)

Editorial

### Advice to Students: Use Reason

Regarding the incident of a female student being insulted in Beiping, this newspaper's editorial on the last day of the past year already pointed out that this is purely a legal case. At most, it only requires following diplomatic channels to achieve the goal of punishing the American soldiers who committed the act of insulting the female student according to the law. There is no need to waste time and abandon studies through strikes. Even if we say that young people are passionate and emotional, unable to control themselves, after the strike is expressed, the authorities have already taken responsibility for negotiations, and the American side is conducting a thorough investigation. Moreover, yesterday, Ambassador Stuart's response to the student representatives in Beijing, in addition to sympathizing with the students, stated that the American military authorities will certainly follow the path of democratic rule of law to ensure that this case is resolved fairly. If the motives of the students' strikes and parades in various places are truly pure, it is appropriate to stop at this point.

As for the incident on the evening of the 1st, when American sailor Rogers from Hongkou and rickshaw puller Cheng Rongfang fought each other, and the sailor stabbed the rickshaw puller with a knife, the facts have been investigated clearly, and the suspect has been arrested. A fair trial will certainly lead to a reasonable judgment. Such incidents, as the spokesman of the municipal government said, are common in international cities, and no country can guarantee that they will never happen. The way to handle them depends entirely on the dignity of the law. The Chinese Constitution has recently been promulgated, and we are moving towards the path of democratic rule of law. Regardless of the matter or the person, we should seek a just and reasonable solution within the scope of the law. Students who use reason well will not use such incidents as an excuse to sacrifice their studies in vain for a long time.

However, according to news reports, the Yan'an side is attempting to use this as an opportunity to incite strikes and market shutdowns in various places to achieve the goal of getting American troops to withdraw from China. In this city, it is also heard that a few students, unaware of the underlying situation, passed some unreasonable resolutions, as if they recognized this as a good opportunity to incite unrest and disrupt order. In that case, the pure initial intentions of the students are inevitably being used by politicians without their knowledge. We originally knew that this kind of action does not represent the public opinion of all students, and we are even more convinced by the student groups' declarations of denial. We also know that with the Lunar New Year approaching, the business and industrial sectors are struggling with economic difficulties and are hoping that the lively New Year's business can slightly alleviate the burden of their lives. The working-class compatriots are busy earning their own living and should not want to disturb themselves with unnecessary troubles and increase their difficulties. If a few students are ignorant of this meaning and are fooled by others, then if there are any illegal or overstepping actions, the government should not hesitate to enforce the law, and the local order will be affected, and social sympathy will certainly not be on the side of these few students. Young students, reading is valued for understanding reason. We also firmly believe that they will eventually use their reason well to prevent ambitious politicians from sacrificing students through this kind of incitement.

Things that can originally gain sympathy often lose sympathy because they go too far. If the students feel that the authorities are indifferent to the insult of the female student and the stabbing of the rickshaw puller, then it may be reasonable to appeal and run around to attract attention from all parties. However, the situation is not like that today. The authorities have already negotiated, and the American side is also investigating. In any case, there will be a clear result and a trial according to the law. If a few students want to use this as an excuse to support the Chinese Communists' "anti-American" movement, they are only showing their ignorance! First, we want to ask: How about the Soviet army's actions in the Northeast? Why are you all silent? Second, for illegal incidents involving a few American soldiers and civilians, there are legal and diplomatic channels to take. Why should you indiscriminately scold the American army? Third, the relationship between China and the United States has always been friendly, and during the War of Resistance, the United States was arguably the most helpful to China among all countries. How can you repay kindness with ingratitude? Is this permitted by the traditional Chinese moral concepts? Finally, it must be especially pointed out that the CCP's "anti-American" movement is actually following orders. Its goal is to force China to have no friendly countries in the international community in the future, starting by damaging the Sino-American relationship. Only in this way can it be convenient for the Communists to do what they want in the future. Our China, after the great war, has not yet recovered from its wounds and urgently needs construction. It is appropriate to seek more help from the international community and not to fall into a trap and dig a pit for ourselves. We love young students, we love the country and the nation, and we sincerely hope to give our loyal advice to the few students, do not be tools for ambitious politicians who are afraid that China will not be in chaos!

### Improving Silk Production: Wuxi Holds a Symposium

[Report from our Wuxi office] The Jiangsu Provincial Silk Industry Improvement and Management Committee believes that there are many reasons for the failure of silk production. If measures are not taken to improve it, there is little hope for the future of silk. Therefore, it has decided to plan to improve silkworm breeding techniques and research new varieties in the 36th year (1947) to gradually revive the 5,000-year-old silk industry. On the 2nd, the Committee convened a symposium on the spring silkworm rearing guidance plan for the 36th year of Jiangsu Province at the Cangbang silk testing ground outside the west gate of Muxi, gathering those in charge of silk mills, grain processing plants, guidance stations, and silk shops in Jiangsu Province. The symposium will last for nine days. The Silk Management Committee will also invite silk experts to give speeches.

### A Local Thug in Zhoushu Town Specializes in Extorting "Traitors": Has Been Detained and Sent to the Jiangsu High Court for Prosecution

[Report from our Suzhou office] Wang Qilong, a local thug in Zhoushu Town, Qishan County, had no legitimate profession. After the victory, he had a strange idea and often threatened to accuse people of being traitors to extort money. Countless people have been victimized by him.

### Shuyang Suffers a Great Calamity by the Communist Army: People are Forced to Follow the Army in Exile; No Inhabitants Within Twenty Li of the City Suburbs

[Our Haizhou Dispatch] The Communist army entrenched in Shuyang County has, due to recent defeats in the northern Jiangsu battles, reached the brink of total collapse. Their atrocities against the populace have intensified. Communist Party district and township governments in various areas recently summoned the people to open-door meetings, forcing all residents, regardless of gender or age, to move north with the army. Those who refused were to be executed. Currently, within twenty li of Shuyang County, there are no inhabitants, and not a sound of chickens or dogs can be heard.

[Our Haizhou Dispatch] The four counties under Haizhou, with Shuyang County being the most fertile, boast the highest annual agricultural yield of the four. The abundance of trees, especially in the villages, surpasses that of all sixty counties in the province. Between summer and autumn, as far as the eye can see, young trees stand gracefully, swaying in the breeze, while old trees sway with a dignified charm. Villages and fields are almost entirely shaded by lush, beautiful trees. By winter, the ancient trees and bare forests evoke poetic and artistic sentiments. Furthermore, farming families rely on the forests near their villages, selectively felling trees in winter to make farm implements and sell them to neighboring counties, resulting in a significant annual supplementary income. However, after the entire territory was occupied by the Communist army, landlords were forced to hand over public grass. The common people, unable to provide grass, had no choice but to painfully sacrifice and cut down the established trees to supply them. The insatiable Communist army has recently intensified the felling of trees for fuel. Currently, the forests in various villages have been almost entirely cut down. The scene is desolate, with only weeds and barren smoke to be seen! The loss of trees alone in the county is incalculable. Such a great calamity is truly unprecedented in history.

### Northern Jiangsu Cotton-Producing Area: Dazhongji Recaptured

[Our Dongtai Dispatch] Dazhongji Town, located in the ninth district of this county, is situated in a remote coastal area and has long been a central hub for cotton production in northern Jiangsu. Merchants from Beijing, Shanghai, and other places have traditionally relied on it for supplies. It was quite prosperous before the war. During the enemy puppet regime period, it was devastated. Later, after being forcibly occupied by the Communist army, it was subjected to strict blockades, causing merchants to hesitate, resulting in local fragmentation and hardship for the people. It lost its pre-war prosperity and vitality. Subsequently, the National Army stationed in Liuzhuang, upon the request of the local compatriots, promptly rescued them from their suffering, entering and stationing there on December 11th. At that time, the people, feeling relieved from ten years of sinking, once again seeing the light of day, were all overjoyed and inspired. Currently, the Ninth District Public Office of this county has been ordered to move from Cao Nian Town to Dazhongji Town to conduct official business.

### Letter to the Editor

To the Editor: After reading the Changshu news report in your newspaper on December 25th regarding the conflict between students of this school and post office staff, much of it does not align with the facts. The circumstances are described as follows:

December 22nd was a scheduled holiday. At 10:00 AM, Tian Weijun, a third-year student in the Normal Science Department of this school, was entrusted by his classmate Zhang Runquan to mail a letter containing twenty-six New Year's cards. He had clipped the left corner and affixed postage stamps worth 250 yuan. At that time, post office employee Xue Jinfu said the letter was overweight and additional postage was required. Student Tian inquired with the employee, requesting to see the regulations. Unexpectedly, the employee's attitude was arrogant, ignoring the request. A disagreement arose. Later, the employee, with a fierce demeanor, suddenly reached out from the window and forcefully pulled Tian's clothes, demanding that he look at the postage rate chart. Tian, fearing he was about to be beaten, resisted, leading to a conflict. During the struggle, a corner of the window glass was broken. At that time, many post office employees rushed over and dragged Tian to the package room in the back, closing the two doors tightly and forcibly detaining him. At this time, five students from this school happened to be passing by the post office and, upon hearing the news, argued with the post office. The post office ignored them. In order to rescue Tian, the students attempted to push the door open. Post office employee Xue Jinfu personally blocked the door, refusing entry, leading to a conflict. Both post office employee Xue and student Zhang Runquan from our school sustained minor injuries. The school's instructor rushed to the scene upon hearing the news, but the students involved had already returned to school. However, the post office detained two students who were unrelated to the incident but had come to mail letters. Only after repeated negotiations were they released. It was determined that this case was caused by a misunderstanding by both parties. The school has already severely punished the students involved according to school regulations. Currently, Police Chief Wang of the police station has mediated the case, and it has been peacefully resolved. However, since this school recently moved from Sichuan to Changshu, it still needs much assistance from the local community. It is truly regrettable that this unfortunate incident occurred. We respectfully request that you provide a public clarification to set the record straight. Sincerely, Normal Department of the National Social Education College to the Editorial Department of Shen Bao.

### The Eightieth Congress Inaugurated Yesterday: America Enters a New Political Era; The Future Direction of American Policy is Closely Watched by the World; President Truman is Scheduled to Deliver a Policy Address Next Week

[Central News Agency Washington 3rd Dispatch] As the American Eightieth Congress (the first Republican Congress in sixteen years) convenes, the United States is about to face a new era of politics. The new Congress will not only encounter several serious domestic issues, which are set to make this legislative body deliberate for an entire year, but also confront a Democratic president who may use his veto power to challenge congressional legislation. Although both the Democratic and Republican parties have declared that they will cooperate for the welfare of the country, if Congress cannot cooperate with Truman, a stalemate is bound to occur. Republicans have indicated that they will oppose Truman's "radical" or New Deal proposals. Until Truman submits his message to Congress, no one can be sure what form of legislation the President will recommend. It is believed that Truman's message will be a compromise, as he is likely unwilling to provoke an open struggle between the Democratic government and the Republican Congress. In foreign affairs, Vandenberg has indicated that bipartisan foreign policy should extend beyond the United Nations and European peace issues. It is believed that this bipartisan foreign policy will not be criticized.

[Reuters Washington 3rd Dispatch] The American Eightieth Congress will hold its first meeting today. There is much speculation about the many policy changes to come. As to whether it will adopt an isolationist approach like after World War I, there is no indication yet. President Truman plans to address the joint session of both houses of Congress next week, delivering his long-awaited general policy speech. The Republican-controlled Congress is scheduled to convene today, but the real start of the legislative year is when Truman delivers his speech. Truman will submit two reports to Congress: an economic report with budget recommendations and a budget proposal. The party distribution in the two houses is as follows: House of Representatives, 246 Republicans, 186 Democrats; Senate, 51 Republicans, 45 Democrats.

[Central News Agency Washington 3rd Dispatch] The Republican Senate Caucus today passed the selection of chairmen and members for the fifteen Senate committees. These fifteen committees will largely determine the course of the legislative agenda of the Eightieth American Congress. The United States Representative to the United Nations, Vandenberg, was nominated as Chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee. The Naval and Military Affairs Committees have now been merged into the Military Affairs Committee, chaired by Senator Gurney. Hruska will chair the powerful Appropriations Committee, which has the authority to control funds and restrict their use, wielding significant power over those in office. Tobey will chair the Banking and Currency Committee, overseeing all financial matters relating to taxes and appropriations, legislation, and managing the government's financial plans, including foreign loans. Republican Majority Leader Wherry will chair the Interstate and Foreign Commerce Committee, with the authority to manage highways, railways, and air transportation. Taft will chair the Welfare Committee.

### Both Parties Nominate Congressional Leaders: Vandenberg Expected to Be Elected as Senate President

[Our Washington Correspondent 3rd Dispatch] The Republican Party has swiftly and smoothly completed the election of its congressional leaders yesterday, and has drafted the details of its legislative program, including major proposals for tax cuts, economic stability, and the development of peacetime industries. At the same time, the Democratic Party has also smoothly completed the election of leaders in both the House and Senate. The Eightieth Congress is scheduled to open at noon on the 3rd. The elected leaders of both parties have expressed their willingness to cooperate for the national interest. President Truman has indicated his willingness to comply and will reiterate his position in his message to Congress. The already determined nominees for the leaders of both houses are as follows:

(1) Republican Senator Vandenberg will serve as Speaker of the Senate. (2) Senator Wherry will be the Republican Leader in the Senate. (3) Senator Barkley will continue to be the Democratic Leader in the Senate. (4) Republican Congressman Martin will serve as Speaker of the House. (5) Congressman Halleck will be the Republican Leader in the House. (6) Congressman Rayburn will be the Democratic Leader in the House.

The Republican Party in the Senate is preparing to attack Democratic Senator Bilbo when Congress convenes, accusing him of "fraud and malfeasance" in his third election as Senator, but Bilbo has not yet shown any sign of yielding. According to Republican Senator Taft, a candidate for the 1948 presidential election, if Bilbo is unwilling to concede, his opponents will use full force to pass a resolution to disqualify Bilbo from being a Senator.

[Reuters Washington 3rd Dispatch] Senator Vandenberg is the most watched person by all parties. Until the Pearl Harbor incident, he was still a leading isolationist, but he recently indicated that he would no longer participate in international affairs and would focus his efforts on Senate work. It is generally believed that this action indicates his intention to serve as Secretary of State in a Republican government in 1948. It is generally acknowledged that his attendance at the foreign ministers' conferences in London, Paris, and New York was particularly helpful in completing the five-nation peace treaty. His participation in the United Nations General Assembly Budget Committee guarantees that Congress will approve the United States' responsibility for a large portion of the funding for the United Nations organization. Vandenberg recently announced that Byrnes' foreign policy has the support of most Republicans, but he also specifically stated that this support is limited to the tasks of the United Nations organization and the policy of the five-nation peace treaty. Currently, the State Department wants Congress to approve a huge sum of 300 to 400 million yuan to continue providing individual relief to European countries. It is expected that the Republican-controlled Congress will demand the right to decide which countries should receive relief. Therefore, it is expected that when the Congressional committee considers this matter, the State Department will reveal its policy toward Italy, Greece, and Eastern European countries. The Export-Import Bank, which provides foreign loans, is still not under the control of Congress. Therefore, when the government requests to increase the capital of the bank, it must first make the bank subject to more direct control by Congress before approval can be hoped for. Regarding the State Department's international trade plan, new legislation is not needed for the time being. The government's power to reduce tariffs will continue by law until March 1946. The International Trade Organization Conference will also not be convened until the end of 1947. Therefore, American participation in the organization will require Congress to approve it at least several months later. However, the 18-nation tariff reduction conference to be held in Geneva this April will allow Congress to express its attitude toward the State Department's international trade policy.

### The Situation in Vietnam Takes Many Twists and Turns: Hovering on the Brink of Peace and War; Moutet's Trip to Hanoi is Worthy of Attention

[Report from this Newspaper] Paris 3rd Broadcast: French government officials stated today that under the current circumstances, the French side cannot negotiate with the Viet Minh authorities. Unless hostilities cease immediately, negotiations cannot begin.

[United Press Paris 2nd Dispatch] A French government spokesperson today rejected the peace proposal made by Ho Chi Minh, President of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, stating that negotiations are impossible in the current state. Although there have been reports that French Colonial Minister Moutet will meet with Ho, the spokesperson expressed doubts about Ho's authority, saying: "We cannot engage in negotiations when Viet Minh guerrillas are still sniping at French officials." This implies that issuing reciprocal ceasefire orders and restoring order are prerequisites for conducting negotiations. The spokesperson also stated: "During negotiations, France must verify the authority of the negotiating party. No one knows where Ho Chi Minh's government is or who else is in the government."

According to Saigon sources: Moutet has flown out of Saigon, planning to go to Hanoi, implying that he will meet with Ho Chi Minh. Moutet said: "If I can return to Paris with a peaceful liberation plan, it will be a great victory." According to reliable sources, the French authorities in Hanoi are in direct contact with officials of the Vietnamese People's Government. Viet Minh radio broadcast that the government plans to hold a secret meeting somewhere in Hanoi. French official statements in Paris say that Moutet does not have full authority to negotiate in Hanoi, but can be granted this authority by telegram if necessary. Moutet can only engage in mediation work for the time being, in order to submit a report to the French Cabinet. His son is currently in Hanoi collecting information on his behalf. Former Commander of the French Far East Forces Leclerc is in Haiphong and will also rush to Hanoi to jointly handle the matter. According to Hanoi sources, Viet Minh troops shelled French positions in Hanoi on the night of the 2nd.

[Agence France-Presse Saigon 2nd Dispatch] Ho Chi Minh, President of the Viet Minh Republic, delivered a New Year's message to the French government and his own country yesterday, declaring his determination to fight against reactionary colonialism, but hoping to ultimately achieve understanding. At the same time, French Overseas Minister Moutet left here today for Hanoi.

[Agence France-Presse Saigon 2nd Dispatch] French Overseas Colonial Minister Moutet's departure from here to Hanoi today caused a great shock here. Moutet's trip was kept strictly secret beforehand and was only announced to the press hours after his departure. There is indeed some danger along the way, as French planes are often attacked by Viet Minh anti-aircraft fire each time they fly over Viet Minh positions. Ho Chi Minh, President of the Viet Minh Republic, previously made a broadcast speech hoping that Moutet would go to Hanoi to meet with him.

As for the "Zhendan" newspaper in Paris claiming that the British and American armies will soon merge into one, including the area from the Arctic to the Gulf of Mexico in the north and south, and from Asia Minor to Japan in the east and west, it is exaggerated.

[United Press London 2nd Dispatch] The fact that the United Kingdom and the United States have agreed to standardize certain military equipment has been officially confirmed.

[Reuters, Washington, 2nd] The House Naval Affairs Committee today issued a special report, arguing that the United States should acquire full rights to all islands in the Pacific owned or administered by other countries, such as Manus Island, Nomia Island, Espiritu Santo Island, and Guadalcanal Island, because these islands are located on the security chain of the United States, and other countries are unable to defend them. For the safety of the United States and the Western Hemisphere, and for the peace of the Pacific, the United States should at least obtain primary control over the islands formerly administered by Japan, such as the Marshall Islands, Caroline Islands, Mariana Islands, as well as Japan's Ogasawara Islands and Ryukyu Islands. The United States should have specific base rights in places where it has built bases on Allied islands. The United States must not allow its Pacific bases to return to an unprepared state, similar to the situation of Wake Island and Guam before the war.

### US President Formally Announces End of State of War: Overseas Garrison Troops Continue to Perform Duties

### Strait Issue: Turkey's Position Remains Firm; No US Troops Stationed in Turkish or Iranian Territory

[Agence France-Presse, Ankara, 2nd] Foreign newspapers report that Turkey has submitted to the Soviet government a plan for the establishment of an agreement between the Soviet Union and Turkey. This statement was recently denied by Turkish officials, who stated that Turkey still opposes resolving the issue of the Dardanelles Strait without international agreement. This attitude of the Turkish government can be seen as Turkey's inability to agree to any attempt that violates its sovereignty and territorial integrity.

[Our Dispatch] San Francisco, 3rd (Broadcast): Regarding reports from Moscow that US troops are stationed in Turkey and Iran, the US State Department issued a statement categorically denying this. According to a recent article published in Moscow's New Times magazine, US troops have violated the guarantees provided by Mr. Byrnes to the United Nations by being stationed unofficially in the territories of Turkey and Iran.

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 2nd] Following the Soviet Union's presentation of a note to the United States regarding the Dardanelles Strait issue, the US government has responded. According to comments from diplomatic sources, the US government has already informed the Soviet Union that the Soviet Union should now express its views on this issue. It is a well-known fact that the United States has not agreed to the Soviet Union acquiring bases in Turkish territory. The Soviet Union is very concerned about this issue.

No country should take any action on the Dardanelles Strait before the next meeting of the Four-Power Foreign Ministers.

### Municipal Council's Second General Assembly to Open Day After Tomorrow; Mayor Submits Eight Proposals for Discussion; Municipal Construction Surtax for This Year Still Budgeted According to Reduced Standards; Remainder of Allied Victory Bonds of 100 Million to Be Allocated to Each District for Subscription

[Our Dispatch] Preparations for the second general assembly of the Municipal Council are now largely complete, and it is scheduled to officially open the day after tomorrow. A joint meeting of the conveners of the various committees will be held this afternoon to discuss the agenda. Yesterday, the council received eight proposals submitted by the mayor, which will be presented for public discussion at the general assembly. The submitted proposals are as follows:

Municipal Construction Surtax

(1) A proposal to not double the municipal construction surtax for the winter of the 35th year of the Republic in this city, and to expand the autumn reduction to lighten the burden on the people. For the 36th year of the Republic, in order to balance the budget, the municipal construction surtax will still be budgeted according to reduced standards, and will be treated as a "special tax revenue" for this city, submitted for public decision.

Previous Concession's Assessed Rent Value for the 26th Year of the Republic; Autumn Multiple; Proposed Multiple for Future Collection

100 and below: 5; Exempt (limited to residences)

101-500: 40

1001-1400: 75; 50

1401-1800: 75; 60

1801-2200: 100; 70

2201 and above: 100; 80

This method is calculated on a progressive excess basis. The collection standard is based on the assessed rent value for the 26th year of the Republic in the previous concession, not the amount of patrol fees actually collected in the 26th year. This tax rate is approximately two-thirds lower than the pre-war patrol fees.

### Student Health Fees

(2) A proposal to promptly approve the collection of student health fees starting in the spring of the 36th year of the Republic. The methods are as follows: 1. Municipal primary schools will temporarily collect 2,000 yuan per student per semester, and municipal secondary schools will temporarily collect 3,000 yuan. Private schools may add 50% to the collection standards of municipal schools. Free students are exempt from collection. Vocational schools will charge fees according to the standards of secondary schools. 2. The Bureau of Education will issue a notice to all schools to collect and remit the fees together when collecting tuition fees. 3. The funds will be used exclusively to improve the environmental hygiene of each school and to add sanitary equipment. Private schools will use the funds to pay the salaries of medical personnel.

### Tram Company

(3) The exclusive operation of the British-owned Shanghai Tramway Company is about to expire. A proposal to decide whether to purchase it according to the contract, or whether to extend it for another term (seven years). The proposal also asks to first determine the principle, whether to extend it for another term or to bring it under municipal operation. If it is decided to purchase it, how should the large amount of funds required be raised?

### Allocation of Allied Victory Bonds for Solicitation

(4) In order to continue raising 500 million yuan of the 32nd year of the Republic Allied Victory Bonds according to orders, in addition to increasing the number of replacements, it is proposed that the remaining 100 million yuan be the responsibility of the district offices to solicit subscriptions in order to accomplish the mission. A proposal for public decision. The estimated amount of Allied Victory Bonds allocated to each district office for solicitation is as follows: First level: Huangpu, Lao Zha, Taisan, Lukiawan, Changshu, Jing'an, Xincheng, etc. (7 districts), each district allocated 5 million yuan. Second level: Yimiao, Jiangning, Beizhan, Hongkou, North Sichuan Road, Tilanqiao, etc. (6 districts), each district 4.5 million yuan. Third level: Penglai, Wuning, Putuo, Yulin Road, etc. (4 districts), each district 4 million yuan. Fourth level: Xujiahui, Zhabei, Yangshupu, etc. (3 districts), each district 3 million yuan. Fifth level: Xinjing, Longhua, Yangjing, Gaoqiao, etc. (4 districts), each district 2 million yuan. Sixth level: Xinshijie, Jiangwan, Wusong, Dachang, Yangsi, Zhenru, etc. (6 districts), each district 1 million yuan. Total: 100.1 million yuan.

### Feast and Entertainment Surtax

(5) Regarding the feast and entertainment tax, a new law has been amended by the central government. A proposal to formulate supplementary measures for public decision. The measures are as follows: 1. Regardless of Chinese or Western cuisine, a tax will be levied on all meals exceeding 3,000 yuan. 2. For meals exceeding the starting tax point by less than five times, the tax rate is 10%. For meals exceeding the starting tax point by more than five times, the tax rate is 20%. Among them, first-class restaurants will be taxed at 20%, and second-class restaurants will be taxed at 10%. 3. Restaurants with music, dancing, and other facilities will be taxed at 25% according to the entertainment tax. Those that only sell meals and snacks to the general public will be exempt from taxation.

### Projects to Be Undertaken This Year

(6) A discussion on how to proceed with the projects that must be undertaken in this city in the 36th year of the Republic. Such projects include: Communicating the Suzhou Creek, transportation projects on the north and south banks, flood prevention projects, and the expansion of the Pudong Avenue.

### Resolving the Water Supply Problem in Western Shanghai

(7) A proposal to formulate two measures to resolve the water supply problem in western Shanghai for discussion and public decision. The measures are: 1. Forming a Shanghai West Water Company, to be invested in and funded by specialized banks at the request of the Bureau of Public Utilities. 2. First implement temporary measures, planning to dig eight artesian wells, which can produce 11,000 cubic meters of water per day, requiring an estimated construction cost of 2 billion yuan.

### American Sailor Who Stabbed a Rickshaw Puller to Be Transferred to the District Procuratorate Today; Mayor Says This Is an Ordinary Criminal Case; If the Charges Are Confirmed After Trial, He Will Definitely Be Punished According to Law

[Our Dispatch] After the incident in which American sailor Roger, of the UNRRA's Fishery vessel, injured rickshaw puller Cheng Rongfang on Fuxing Island, the city authorities immediately dispatched personnel to investigate the situation. The perpetrator has now been detained at the Tilanqiao Police Station and will be transferred to the District Procuratorate for questioning this morning.

Roger, 26 years old, came here on a fishing boat donated to the UNRRA. At around 11:00 PM on New Year's Day, he hailed a rickshaw in Hongkou with several friends, and an argument broke out with Cheng. He stabbed Cheng in the chest, abdomen, and face with a knife. Cheng's injuries are quite serious and he is still receiving treatment at the Country Hospital.

[Another Report] Regarding the incident on New Year's Day late at night on Changzhi Road in which American fishing boat sailor Roger stabbed rickshaw puller Cheng Rongfang, reporters visited Mayor Wu again yesterday to inquire about his opinions and handling methods regarding this matter. Mr. Wu issued a statement saying, "The American sailor who caused this incident is a fishing boat mechanic, not a soldier. He has now been transferred by the police station to the court for handling. This matter is an ordinary criminal case. This city, where people from all countries reside, is bound to have such incidents occur from time to time, which is quite common. We ought not pay overmuch attention to it. Once the trial of the perpetrator is over and the charges are confirmed, he will certainly be punished according to law. Certain newspapers deliberately exaggerate and distort the facts in their reports, which obviously serves another purpose. I hope that people from all walks of life will recognize the facts and not be misled by their propaganda with a hidden agenda. If there are any doubts about the truth of this matter, you may inquire at the Tilanqiao Police Sub-bureau or at the Municipal Government. I will appoint a responsible person to provide detailed answers," and so on.

### Communist Party Deliberately Expanding Propaganda, Launching Anti-American Movement Again

Since the incident in Beiping in which American soldiers allegedly insulted a female student, the Communist Party in this city has, through its peripheral organizations, mobilized some students to strike and protest, attempting to expand the anti-American movement. However, since the American side has fully accepted the requests made by our government, this matter could have been concluded. One evening, at the entrance of the Seaside Bar at the intersection of Changzhi Road and Gaoyang Road, an incident occurred in which an American fishing boat sailor and a rickshaw puller had a dispute, resulting in the rickshaw puller, Cheng Rongfang, being stabbed by the American sailor, Roger. The sailor was arrested on the spot by the Tilanqiao Police Sub-bureau. Mayor Wu has issued a statement regarding this incident, explaining that the perpetrator is an American sailor on a fishing boat, not an American soldier. The sailor has been arrested by the police and will be publicly tried and punished according to our country's laws. However, the Communist Party, seeing an opportunity to exploit, in addition to instigating a few newspapers to deliberately exaggerate and distort the facts in their reports, has also mobilized its peripheral organizations in an attempt to expand the anti-American movement again. Yesterday morning and afternoon, the "Committee to Protest American Military Atrocities," organized by a few students from Jiaotong University, held a meeting to discuss steps to expand the anti-American movement. The following decisions were reportedly made on the spot:

A. Proposals and Resolutions: 1. Expand the demonstration (agreed upon and must unite with industrial and commercial organizations). 2. Call on all sectors to strike and petition in Nanjing (passed for petition in Nanjing, to be decided by the joint committee of universities in Shanghai protesting American military atrocities, but must be submitted to the joint committee; first send representatives to petition, and if there are no results, petition en masse). 3. Continue the strike (passed and must be resumed only if the protest committee deems the government's response satisfactory). 4. Demand that rickshaw pullers, as occupational representatives, participate in the demonstration (passed). 5. Divide into several small groups to publicize to citizens, and request that the school postpone exams and that professors go on strike, etc. 6. Demand that the government prohibit American soldiers from landing and that American armed forces withdraw from Shanghai. 7. Boycott American goods. 8. Expand publicity (Publicity points: 1. Each school should divide into several small groups of 12 people each to give oral publicity to elementary and middle schools in the area; 2. Each group must bring a signature book (i.e., a signature campaign); 3. Each group must ask each elementary and middle school to participate and join the Joint Committee to Protest American Military Atrocities; 4. Each group should inform each elementary and middle school as much as possible about the American military atrocities; 5. Explain the distorted remarks of the media). 9. Issue a declaration to the American soldiers, expand publicity, and target the general public (passed). 10. Do not cooperate with American soldiers (passed). 11. Raise the emotions of classmates in the school (passed). 12. Severely punish the perpetrator who stabbed the rickshaw puller (passed). 13. Protest the distorted reporting of facts (passed). 14. Publicly try the perpetrator (passed). 15. Use the protest of American military atrocities as the theme (passed). B. Reports: 16. Because the strength of the student community is too small, contact has now been made with various organizations in this city that have assisted in the work, including: (1) China Democratic National Construction Association, (2) China Association for Promoting Democracy, (3) Industry and Commerce Association, (4) Women's Temperance League, (5) Shanghai Branch of the All-China Women's Federation, (6) China People's World Peace Promotion Association, (7) China International Human Rights Protection Association, (8) All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, (9) China Economic Undertakings Advancement Association, (10) Democratic Promotion Association of the Financial Industry, (11) September 3rd Society. 17. Decided that tomorrow (the 4th) will be publicity day, with Jiaotong University responsible for the western Shanghai area.

### Statement by the Municipal Government Spokesperson

Reporters made a special visit to the Municipal Government spokesperson to inquire about their opinions on this matter. According to reports, regarding the case of the American sailor Roger stabbing our rickshaw puller Cheng Rongfang, Mayor Wu has formally issued a statement, pointing out that the Roger is an American fishing boat sailor, not an American soldier, and that the perpetrator has been arrested on the spot by our police and will be publicly tried and punished according to our country's laws. Shanghai is an international city where Chinese and foreigners live together. Such incidents are common in various international cities, and it is difficult to prevent them from happening. However, since such incidents are ordinary criminal cases, they should be handled within the scope of the law. There is absolutely no reason to use this as a basis for expanding the anti-American movement. The so-called "Committee to Protest American Military Atrocities" is organized by a few students, and the organizations listed in its report are not only unregistered according to law, but also the members and tendencies of its organization are well known to all sectors of society and can never represent the people of Shanghai. The matters decided by it are also for other purposes. It is hoped that students from all schools will not be used by it. School authorities and parents of students should also earnestly persuade their children to wait for the court to publicly try the case and make a fair decision according to law. If any police or military attempts to disrupt public order, engage in unruly actions, infringe on the freedom of local people, or coerce others to agree, the government will, of course, impose sanctions according to law.

### Federation of Labor Demands Punishment of the Perpetrator and Compensation

Regarding the case of the American Roger stabbing the rickshaw puller Cheng Rongfang with a knife, the Shanghai Federation of Labor held an emergency meeting of its standing council at 2:00 PM yesterday in the meeting room of the federation. The following resolutions were made: (1) Petition the government to severely punish the perpetrator, compensate for the victim's losses, and guarantee that similar incidents will not happen again in the future. (2) Telegram the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the National Government to file a serious protest, which must achieve the above two requirements. (3) The Chairman Shui Xiangbo and all the standing council members will present a petition to Mayor Wu at 11:00 AM today to state the purpose of the demand and request that it be handled promptly according to law. (4) Request the federation's legal advisors Zhou Lianze, Mao Zhen, and Chen Zhen to act as lawyers to file a lawsuit and telegram the local court to severely punish the perpetrator according to law. (5) Send personnel to investigate the detailed circumstances of the incident. (6) Designate Liang Yongzhang, Fang Rusheng, Gui Fusheng, and Qiu Changjiang to visit Cheng and his family at the hospital on the afternoon of the 3rd to express condolences and give a consolation payment of 200,000 yuan.

### Confiscated a Gang Specializing in Robbing Silver Shops - Three Criminals Arrested, Main Culprit on the Run

[Report from our Newspaper] On the 29th of last month, at 1:30 PM, Dong Fugen, one of the robbers who attacked the Le Xiang Yun Silver Shop at No. 125 Henan Road, was apprehended on the spot by a patrol team from the North Railway Station Police Station. During the interrogation, he confessed to having an accomplice named Xu Guo. He also confessed that the day before his arrest, they jointly robbed the Qing Fu Silver Shop on Lu De Yuan Road in the southern part of the city, and committed several street robberies in the busy areas of Ningbo Road and Shanxi Road. He stated that the revolver they carried during each robbery was provided by Xu, who resided at No. 124 Fujian North Road. Upon receiving this information, the police station immediately dispatched staff member Luo, along with police chiefs Li Fengyong and Qiao Zhaolin, to make an arrest. However, Xu had already fled to Chuansha upon hearing the news. He was finally apprehended a few days ago at the pier of the Water Hotel. Based on Xu's confession, another accomplice, Huang Mengsheng, who was responsible for transporting the firearms, was arrested in Chuansha City. However, the main culprit is still at large. According to Huang's confession, they originally planned to expand their organization and specialize in robbing silver shops. All firearms were transported from Songjiang to Chuansha, and then transferred to Shanghai.

### Shanghai Student General Association Convenes a Meeting of School Representatives - Resolution Opposing Continued Strikes

Recently, the student community in Shanghai has been in an uproar over the incident of American soldiers raping a Chinese female student in Beiping. Students from universities such as Jiaotong, Jinan, and Tongji have been actively advocating for the government to lodge a protest. They have also implemented strikes and launched demonstrations. The Shanghai Student General Association, recognizing that such excessive actions not only affect students' studies but also easily create chaotic situations that could be manipulated by conspirators, convened a meeting of school representatives at Tongde Medical College at approximately 6:00 PM yesterday. Representatives from various branches, including Daxia, Fudan, John, Jiaotong, Tongji, Politics and Law, Aurora, and Jinan, totaling over a hundred people, attended the meeting. The meeting was presided over by Feng Zhizheng, Chairman of the Executive Committee of the association. The following resolutions were passed: (1) Opposing continued strikes; (2) Expressing satisfaction with the American military's acceptance of all protests; (3) Notifying students in the branches to be vigilant against conspirators expanding the situation; (4) Consoling the students from Jinan University who were beaten and publishing a letter to the students. The meeting concluded at 9:00 PM. The text of the association's second letter to the students against the United States is as follows:

"Fellow Students:

In recent days, due to the incident of American military brutality, all students in this city have been emotionally charged, expressing righteous cries for their insulted classmates and firmly demanding that the government lodge a protest. This action is entirely sincere, legitimate, and reasonable. However, as a result of the developments, the situation has become increasingly expansive and has gradually developed into a strike, which faces a serious situation. We cannot help but reiterate our appeal, asking students to give serious consideration, engage in rational thought, follow proper channels, and seek reasonable solutions. It is crucial not to make overly radical decisions based solely on momentary impulses. We believe that this is not only the attitude we should adopt but also the unanimous demand of all students in the city. Now, at a time when everyone's emotions are agitated, we hope that students will recognize the development of the situation and not allow the strike to expand further, affecting their own studies. Impatience will not help the situation and will only increase unnecessary difficulties. Only by uniting our tense emotions and making powerful appeals can we eradicate the recurrence of similar incidents. Therefore, there is no need to continue the strike, let alone escalate it. We believe that the arrogant conspiracy activities of certain individuals will not succeed. Situations that need clarification will eventually be clarified. Attempts to stir up trouble with ulterior motives will not succeed. Fellow students, today, news has come that the American military authorities have accepted all of our students' demands. This is the result of our struggle. If we continue the strike, we will undoubtedly sacrifice our studies to satisfy the selfish desires of certain ambitious individuals. We should firmly oppose these conspiracy disturbances, overcome impulsiveness with calmness, and respond to all changes with constancy, striking a blow to those who create trouble. May we succeed. Shanghai Student General Association. January 4, 1947."

### Xu Guanqun Reported - Suspected of Aiding the Enemy with Resources - The High Prosecutor's Office Will Investigate According to Law

[Report from our Newspaper] Xu Guanqun, General Manager of the New Asia Pharmaceutical Factory, Zhao Rudiao, Factory Director, and Gu Houfu, Manager, were reported on New Year's Eve last year by Tan Feng, an office worker in the factory's business department, on suspicion of assisting the enemy with resources. The Supreme National Defense Council resolved that reports of traitors would be limited to the end of 1946, and prosecutors would not consider cases reported after that date. Therefore, the Xu case is among the last batch of reports. (The state's right of prosecution and the victim's right to sue are not affected.) According to the original reporter, the defendants: (1) Xu Guanqun is the General Manager of the New Asia Pharmaceutical Factory. Since 1943, he has served as a director of the puppet Commercial Control Association and a director of the enemy Central China Pharmaceutical Industry Cooperative. Recently, the Wujin County Council in Xu's hometown reported 52 traitors, including Xu. (2) Zhao Rudiao is the Factory Director of the New Asia Pharmaceutical Factory. He graduated from Chiba University in Japan. The saline produced by New Asia was supplied to the enemy Takeda Pharmaceutical Factory for the production of military supplies, thus aiding the enemy. This behavior is evidenced by the Takeda Pharmaceutical Factory's invoice. Each delivery was directly transported by the enemy military's trucks. Zhao Rudiao also served as the Executive Director of the Enemy Central China Pharmaceutical Industry Cooperative and the Chairman of the Shanghai Special City Pharmaceutical Industry Association. (3) Gu Houfu is Zhao's main assistant. The High Prosecutor's Office has received the above report and will investigate according to law.

### A Gang of Robbers Discovered at the Da Hu Hotel - More Than Ten Criminals Involved in Three Cases - Scattered in Three Locations, Military Weapons and Stolen Goods Confiscated

[Report from our Newspaper] At around 9:00 PM on New Year's Eve last year, Shen Deheng and Chen Jingshan, the Director and Deputy Director of the City Temple Police Bureau, received a confidential report stating that a large number of robbers were hiding in the Da Hu Hotel near East Xin Bridge. The squad leader Guo Jitian led squad members Xie Wanfu, patrol officer Mai Wenlin, police chief Li Haosheng, and officers Li Jiafu, Ju Bin, and Zhang Minghui, along with over twenty others, in police vehicles. When they arrived at Room 212 of the Da Hu Hotel, they found no one inside. However, they discovered a note on the table that said, "Little Li, come upstairs for a chat." They also saw a large number of loose Craven cigarettes on the table, so they sent police officers to guard the room. Soon after, a person returned from outside and went straight into Room 212. The police officers apprehended him and found a new Parker 51 fountain pen in his pocket, which had not been filled with ink. When asked his name, he said it was Li Rongwen. When asked where the fountain pen came from, he replied that he had bought it more than ten days ago. When asked if he knew any friends in the hotel, he replied that Tang Cheng in Room 619 on the sixth floor was an acquaintance. This aroused suspicion, so squad leader Guo sent police officers to guard him in the room. At the same time, he led other police officers to Room 619 on the sixth floor, where they found a person named Tang Cheng. They also saw several boxes of Craven cigarettes on the table. When asked if he knew Little Li in Room 212, he replied that he did not. Squad leader Guo and the others saw that his words were evasive and knew that he was not a good person, so they arrested him and took him to the bureau for interrogation. He confessed that he had just robbed the Sino-American Cigarette and Paper Store at No. 931 Linsen Middle Road an hour ago and was resting in the room. He also confessed that his accomplices were hiding at No. 2 Shihua Inn, Baohua Lane, East Changzhi Road. The original investigators went to the address and arrested two more robbers, Chen Henglong and Chen Chunlin. They also confessed that all the stolen goods were stored at the home of Deng Meiyun at No. 45 Baohua Lane. A Japanese box cannon, twenty rounds of ammunition, US$2,022, £9, twenty-three silver dollars, 1.6 million Hong Kong dollars, three taels of red gold, 1.2 million yuan in legal tender, various famous cigarettes, six gold rings, two pairs of earrings, a Parker pen, three boxes of cigars, two hundred Indian rupees, thirty-eight US dimes, a pair of riding breeches, and gold-inlaid wooden fish were confiscated. They admitted that on December 1st, Li Rong, Chen Henglong, and others went to Zhou Yongxing's house at No. 11, Lane 606, Linsen Middle Road, and robbed four suits, nine gold rings, and a wool coat and fur coat each, and a wireless telephone. They also said that on the 22nd of that month, they went to Li Xiaodi's leather shop at No. 36 Sanpailou in the city and robbed six leather coats. It was later discovered that one of the coats had been sold to a secondhand dealer, one had been pawned, and the remaining four had been deposited at the home of a Mr. Jiang at No. 70 Fuxing East Road. When the police went to the house, Jiang had already received the news and fled. It was said that the confiscated Japanese box cannon was introduced by their friend Sun Yinchun, who had offered 300,000 yuan to purchase it from a soldier in Nanjing. The transaction took place in a small teahouse in Nicheng Bridge. The police then ordered the arrest of Sun Yinchun. All one thousand criminals have been temporarily detained and will be transferred to the Garrison Command for investigation after the investigation is completed.

### Unprecedented Grand Gathering of the Cultural Circle - Celebrate the Promulgation of the Constitution - Attendees Exceed a Thousand, No Empty Seats in the Auditorium - Enthusiastic Expectations for the Future of Culture and Education

[Report from our Newspaper] The Shanghai Cultural Circle New Year's Celebration was held at the Kang Le Restaurant yesterday afternoon from 2:00 PM to 5:00 PM. Pan Gongzhan, Chairman of the Shanghai Cultural Movement Committee, invited people from the city's education, news, art, music, drama, and film circles to participate. Guests included Li Shizeng, Fang Zhi, Hong Ludong, Shao Hua, Shang Shenbo, Yan Duhe, Ma Gongyu, Duan Benkai, Hong Shen, Zhang Chongren, Zai Ya, Ying Yunwei, Luo Xuelian, Li Ximou, and others, totaling over nine hundred men and women, as well as reporters from various newspapers. The auditorium was packed with no empty seats, making it a rare grand gathering in the city's cultural circle. In addition to the members and staff of the Cultural Movement Committee, Wang Yunmei, Wu Luhong, Zhu Huifen, Wu Yanru, Zhang Guanying, Zhang Minyu, Chen Qi, Gu Lanjun, and other ladies were invited to serve as receptionists. The China Electric Company and Cathay Film Company also sent staff to the venue with multiple cameras to film newsreels. At one point, the silver lights shone brightly, and the sound of the cameras was overwhelming, creating an atmosphere of enthusiasm and excitement.

After the meeting began, Pan Gongzhan gave a welcoming speech, and it was decided to invite Li Shizeng, Fang Xikong, and Liu Dajie to give speeches, all expressing joyful expectations for the promulgation of the Constitution and the future of cultural undertakings.

### Pan Gongzhan Delivers a Welcoming Speech and Explains the Spirit and Content of the Constitution

Pan Gongzhan, in his welcoming speech, first described the difficulty of producing the Constitution of the Republic of China. After the successive leadership and struggle of the National Father Sun Yat-sen and President Chiang, and after more than fifty years, countless soldiers and civilians across the country shed blood and sweat, only after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War was this precious Constitution obtained in one year. The formulation of this great law is based on the spirit of the Three Principles of the People and the Five-Power Constitution, while also incorporating the opinions of various parties and factions, referring to the good rules of Europe and the United States, making additions and subtractions, and adopting a moderate approach, deliberated and agreed upon in accordance with the principles of the Political Consultative Conference. Therefore, these 175 articles are by no means the private words of one party or faction, but the public opinion of compatriots from all walks of life across the country. It goes without saying that it will be cherished and supported by all of our people. Although the CCP seats have always been reserved and they have not participated in the National Assembly, the CCP's expectations for the Constitution have already been included in the principles of the Political Consultative Conference. Therefore, the CCP should not fundamentally oppose the Constitution formulated based on these agreed principles. In short, all those who sincerely hope for China's peaceful reunification and embark on the path of democratic politics have the responsibility to support the Constitution and urge its implementation.

Pan Gongzhan then specifically emphasized the points in the Constitution related to education and culture, believing that the cultural circle should pay more attention to this Constitution. He said that Articles 11 to 14 in Chapter 2 stipulate that people have freedom of speech, teaching, writing, publishing, assembly, association, secret communication, and religious belief. According to Article 23, these freedoms shall not be restricted by law, except when necessary to prevent interference with the freedom of others, avoid imminent danger, maintain social order, or promote the public interest. It can be seen that the "constitutional guarantee" method is fully adopted, and it is completely free.

### This Freedom and Rights Should Be Cherished and Loved

Colleagues in the cultural circle will certainly be very satisfied with the freedom of spiritual life granted to us by the Constitution, and at the same time, we should cherish and love this freedom and rights even more, so that we can use it well and benefit the country and the nation. Finally, Pan also said that the Fifth Section of the Thirteenth Article, Chapter on Fundamental National Policy, Education and Culture, from Article 158 to Article 167, a total of ten articles, has clearly stipulated what we have been eagerly hoping for: the Supreme Purpose of Education, equal educational opportunities, free basic education for all school-age children, balanced development of education in various regions, guarantees for the lives and improved treatment of education, science, and art workers, and the determination of the percentage of educational and cultural funding from the central to local levels in the total amount of foreseen calculations: 15% for the central government, 25% for the provinces, and 35% for the cities and counties. From this, it can be seen that the National Assembly and the government in the future attach importance to education and culture, which cannot be compared with other facilities. Truly, in national construction, education comes first, and cultural construction, especially the promotion of Chinese culture, is the most powerful foundation for establishing world peace. Therefore, education and culture occupy an important part in the Chinese Constitution, not only indicating the focus of the "building the Republic" work, but also the ideal of "advancing towards the Great Harmony" must start from this point. It is heard that the Municipal Party Department will invite people from the cultural circle to hold symposiums, divided by category, to promote the Constitution. The New Year's Celebration is the beginning. I deeply hope that the seniors will give more guidance on the relationship between the Constitution and culture, and especially look forward to enthusiastically supporting the implementation of this national law as scheduled.

### Li Shizeng and Others Give Speeches in Succession

Li Shizeng commented on the current so-called "left" or "right" from a political philosophical point of view and talked about world culture. He believed that the currently formulated Constitution is indeed a comprehensive collection of opinions from various parties and factions. Fang Xikong said that the Constitution is a crystallization of the Three Principles of the People and completes a democratic, unified, free, and happy China. Stubborn elements deliberately undermine the Constitution and should be overcome with the culture of the Three Principles of the People. Liu Dajie emphasized the importance of a free atmosphere and believed that cultural and educational undertakings require the union of various forces.

Afterwards, there were entertainment programs such as Guo Yingjun's Qin zither solo, Xu Ruhui's Pipa solo, Lang Yuxiu's soprano solo, Zhang Zhongyuan's and other famous amateurs' Peking Opera a cappella. However, the Chinese music performance of the Allied Music Association was canceled due to lack of time. Finally, the "Cultural Hall" gave away "Sparks of the Nation" movie tickets to all the guests to enhance the atmosphere. The conference adjourned at around 5:00 PM, with guests and hosts parting in great delight.

### Anti-Japanese War Document Exhibition Adds Valuable Exhibits

The Shanghai Anti-Japanese War Document Exhibition, organized by the Municipal Museum at Yokohama Bridge, Sichuan North Road, has been extended to close at 5:00 PM on the 5th due to the large crowds of visitors over the past three days. It is reported that the exhibition has received additional valuable exhibits in the past two days, which have been added to the display starting today. Among the most impressive items are those from Shu Zongqiao and Cao Juren, such as various photographs of the No. 76 Murder Den of the puppet organization and the Japanese Military Police Prison in Hongkou, photographs of Ms. He Ruomei assisting Allied airmen, and various color leaflets and pictorials distributed by the Allied Air Force in Shanghai, all of which are extremely valuable.

### Landlords Request Rent Increase, Ask for Removal of 140x Limit; Mayor Says He Will Submit to Council for Discussion

[Our Newspaper] Over a dozen managers of Chinese and foreign real estate companies in the city recently visited Mayor Wu at the Municipal Government, requesting that he abolish the limit on rent in the city, which is currently capped at 140 times the pre-war level, so that rents could be moderately increased. All landlords in the city are suffering from soaring prices, while rental income is meager. Mayor Wu immediately stated that the case could be submitted to the upcoming council meeting for discussion, as he did not have the authority to make that decision himself. Mayor Wu later met with a reporter from this newspaper and said: Although he himself was unwilling to remove the rent limit, as it would increase the burden on citizens, he was also very sympathetic to the landlords, as the limited rent was extremely unreasonable compared to the current high prices. Therefore, Mayor Wu was deeply concerned that if this continued, no one would be able to afford repairs when houses collapsed. He believed that to alleviate the housing shortage, rents might have to be moderately increased.

### Chief of Jiangwan Ordnance Depot, Wang Renshan, Suddenly Surrenders; Had Fled to Hebei Province to Join the Army in Fear of Punishment, But Was Rejected; Claims He Was Shopping When the Ammunition Depot Exploded

[Our Newspaper] Wang Renshan, the Chief of the Jiangwan Ordnance Depot in the First Supply Zone of the Logistics Command, who had been wanted for fleeing his post in fear of punishment in connection with the explosion at the depot on December 7th of last year, suddenly appeared in front of the First Supply Zone Command headquarters on New Year's Day late at night and surrendered. Jiao Yunchang of the Escort Company reported the matter to Fu Wen, the Commander of the Supply Zone, who had him detained. On the morning of the 2nd, he was initially interrogated by Zang Jiawei, a military judge from the command, and yesterday at noon, he was interrogated again by Yan Zi, the Deputy Director of the Shanghai East Investigation Office of the Garrison Command. According to his confession, his escape was purely due to momentary fear of punishment. The commander of the supply zone has reported the matter to the Ministry of National Defense and requested instructions on how to proceed. At the same time, because Wang had surrendered himself, his wife, Ye Suhua, did not need to be detained. He was ordered last night to release her on bail.

According to Wang Renshan's confession: At the time of the ammunition depot explosion, he was shopping in the city with his wife. He only learned of the explosion when he returned to the end of Sichuan North Road. He rushed back to Jiangwan, but there was nothing he could do to help. He went to the dormitory of the depot staff to find Wu Ruwu, but Wu had already fled. He felt that all responsibility would fall on him, and in a moment of fear, he hid in the home of a relative. He planned to find Wu Ruwu and bring him to justice to reduce his own responsibility. After five days, he still couldn't find Wu. He had no choice but to leave Shanghai for Nanjing, then travel north to Xuzhou, and from Xuzhou across the Yellow River to Hanyang in Hebei, to join Commander Shen of the 75th Division. He explained the situation and planned to atone for his crime through service. Wang had been assigned to Shen's unit after graduating from the Luoyang branch of the military academy, so Shen was his old superior. However, Commander Shen believed that such a flight from duty was not a good idea and did not take him in. At the same time, he enlightened him with the righteousness of a soldier, that he should have the courage to take responsibility, and gave him 200,000 yuan for travel expenses, urging him to return to Shanghai and surrender himself. Wang was deeply moved, so he left southern Hebei and came to Shanghai. After arriving in Shanghai at 8:00 PM on the 1st, he surrendered himself. As for the whereabouts of Wu Ruwu and Chen Hanwen, he really did not know, he said.

Wang is currently being held temporarily at the First Supply Zone Command headquarters and will be interrogated again today.

[Our Newspaper] The Sanbei Steamship Company had dispatched the Ningju steamship to ply the Shanghai-Ningbo line for a long period before the war. After the Japanese invaders advanced southward, the ship was seized and used to sail on the Yangtze River. Because it flew the Japanese flag, it was bombed and destroyed by our aircraft in Huangshi Port. After the victory, the company had not resumed the Shanghai-Ningbo line until recently, when it dispatched the Mingxing steamship, which plied the Yangtze River line, to resume service. It was originally scheduled to sail from Shanghai to Ningbo on January 1st, but a labor dispute arose, preventing it from sailing as scheduled. The company had previously sent a letter to the Seamen's Union requesting the dispatch of sixty workers. The Central Cabin Office (members of the Seamen's Union) assigned sixty people to serve. Unexpectedly, the Anli Association (also members) also requested the dispatch of workers. The company believed that it did not need so many people and did not allow it, leading to a dispute. It is now known that the Central Cabin Office and the Anli Association have reached a settlement. Furthermore, at the Dada Wharf on the 16th wharf, workers also clashed with workers from the Central Market due to the loading and unloading of cargo by the ship. Yu Shunhuai of the company mediated and resolved the matter. Therefore, the ship is scheduled to resume sailing to Ningbo at 2:00 PM this afternoon. Starting next week, it will be scheduled to sail from Shanghai to Ningbo on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. The Dahua steamship of the Ping An Company returned to Shanghai from Ningbo this morning and will continue to sail to Ningbo at 2:00 PM this afternoon. Next week, it will still be scheduled to sail to Ningbo on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays. The new Jiangyun steamship of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company is about to set sail. It is scheduled to test its machines at 2:00 PM this afternoon and to welcome visitors from all walks of life. It will depart from Pier 13 on the Bund, sail to Wusong, and return to port at 4:00 PM. The President Wilson, a passenger ship of the American President Lines, returned to Shanghai from Little Luzon the day before yesterday and is scheduled to leave port and return to the United States at 8:00 AM this morning, carrying over one hundred and sixty passengers to the United States.

### Jiang Dingwen Takes a Boat to The U.S.

General Jiang Dingwen, who had served as the Pacification Commissioner of Shaanxi and the Commander of the First War Zone during the war, took the President Wilson steamer to the United States yesterday with his wife, one son, and two daughters. According to Jiang, he said on the ship: This trip abroad is purely for personal sightseeing and there are no other tasks. He will stay in the United States for half a year, then travel to various parts of Europe. He plans to return to China in a year, and at that time, he will pay more attention to social construction and local administration in various places.

### Zhang Xijun, Wu Taiyu, and Others, Seven Underground Workers Awarded Medals on New Year's Day

Zhang Xijun, the Director of the Shanghai Special Office of the International Issues Research Institute of the Military Commission, and Wu Taiyu, Tu Yangci and other seventeen staff members, engaged in work against Japan during the war and made outstanding contributions. The Military Commission requested and the National Government approved the awarding of Victory Medals to Zhang Xijun, Wu Taiyu, Huang Jianzhong, Zhang Xiqi, Zhuang Yiqing, Wang Ying, Li Shengming, Ni Deguang and other eight people. Tu Yangci, Xie Denan, Li Fanghua, Wang Tongrong, Chen Xin'an and other five people were awarded the First Class Medal of the Army, Navy, and Air Force.

### Several Charitable Deeds Handled by This Column Over the Past Year

— Reporter

"Don't forget the past; it can guide you in the future." As we face the arrival of the 36th year, we are conducting a review of our service effectiveness over the past year with a sense of apprehension, as a reference and guideline for future work. This is a very important and indispensable task. We discard the shortcomings of the past without regret, and we should modestly retain the advantages of the past.

In the past year, we have received many letters of criticism, with more praise than criticism. We are grateful to the readers who praise us, but we should be even more grateful to the readers who criticize us. Because "good medicine tastes bitter but is good for the disease, and honest advice is unpleasant to the ear but beneficial to conduct." Everything can only progress and succeed under fair criticism and public supervision.

According to statistics, 90% of the readers' letters in the past year were inquiries, and medical and legal inquiries were the most numerous, averaging more than 30 letters per day. Due to the limited space and the busy official duties of the consultants, delays were unavoidable. Although we have made the greatest effort to ensure that readers receive answers as soon as possible, the effect is not very significant. Here, we can only ask the readers who care for this column to forgive us. "Life is for service." Based on this principle, we are constantly thinking about how to benefit the public and make people happy. In the past year, we have done several good deeds. Although we have not seen any results for the society or the public, we have done our best. The more important ones are as follows:

(1) Qingxia Fund for the Relief of the Elderly, Widowed, Poor, and Sick - This fund was originally initiated by Elder Qingti, and was later supported by people from all walks of life, so it could continue to be promoted. In order to commemorate the elder's benevolent and compassionate spirit, we named this fund the "Qingxia Fund for the Relief of the Elderly, Widowed, Poor, and Sick." It has been awarded six times, benefiting more than 40 people, and the seventh is currently in the application process.

(2) Shayan Prevention Campaign - Shayan is very common in China. Almost everyone suffers from this disease, especially young students. In order to make the people of the country pay attention to this disease and be vigilant, we started a shayan prevention campaign with the Municipal Relief Hospital on August 23rd of last year. We treated more than 800 shayan patients. Although we dare not say how much help we have given to the patients, we only hope that this will arouse the people of the country's attention to shayan and prevent this disease.

(3) Emergency Assistance Fund - In September of last year, four gentlemen who did not disclose their names, Zou Zhaolin, Jiang Zengxi, and Ye Desheng, donated 20 million yuan to entrust this column to handle the emergency assistance fund to help the poor and critically ill patients. After receiving the entrustment, we specially contracted with seven hospitals, Shanghai Guangci, Renji, Gongji, the First Red Cross Hospital, the Municipal Second and Fourth, and the Ximen Women's and Children's Hospital, to handle the assistance fund. By the end of last year, about 100 people had benefited. We would like to express our sincere gratitude to the hospitals for their enthusiastic support.

There are also job introductions, charitable disaster relief, communication with readers, answering questions for all sectors of society... etc., we must fulfill considerable obligations every day, trivial and countless.

The above are the important good deeds we have held in the past year. Due to the weakness of our strength and the lack of material conditions, the results received are very small. At the beginning of this new year, we must be more vigilant ourselves and strive to achieve a state of truly "serving society."

### President Song Holds Meetings in Shanghai to Discuss the Issue of Suppressing and Stabilizing Prices; The Central Bank's Gold Policy Remains Unchanged

President of the Executive Yuan, Song Ziwen, came to Shanghai to spend the New Year. Yesterday, he went to the Bank of China Building to work. Mayor Wu Guozhen, General Manager of the China Textile Corporation, Shu Yunzhang, and key officials of the Central Bank all came to pay their respects and held meetings. It is said that Mr. Song gave instructions on the production loans to be issued soon and on stabilizing prices, suppressing the price of gold and banknotes, etc. Therefore, the Central Bank will open today and the gold policy will remain unchanged from last year, with open distribution and concealed sales, without any alteration. President of the bank, Bei Zuyi, will return to Shanghai from Hong Kong on the 5th. Also, the black market for gold in the city had surged in the past two days, reaching over 3.7 million yuan, but this was purely due to small silver shops and speculators stirring up trouble, and it could not last. Yesterday, it had dropped to 3.5 million yuan. Because the Central Bank's holiday ends today, it will inevitably continue to distribute gold as before, so the people's speculative psychology has weakened and prices have fallen.

### Overview of Cotton Spinning Industry Production in Shanghai in 1946: Monthly Output of 86,000 Pieces of Yarn

There are fifty privately-owned yarn mills in Shanghai, with a total of more than 1.19 million spindles. In addition, the China Textile Construction Corporation received equipment from enemy yarn mills in Shanghai, totaling 900,000 spindles. The two combined have a total of 2.1 million spindles. Except for more than ten small yarn mills (with a total of 40,000 spindles), all are under the control of the Textile Management Committee. The thirty-four privately-owned mills under control are Datong, Tongyi, Guangqin, Defeng, Xinsheng, China Textile 1, 2, Hengfeng, Hefeng, Chongxin, Hengtong, Anda, Dongfeng, Shenxin 1, Shenxin 2, Shenxin 5, Shenxin 6, Shenxin 7, Shenxin 9, Hongzhang, Cheng Zheng 1, 2, Huayang, Xinhe, Rende, Hengda, Rongfeng 1, Rongfeng 2, Dingxin, Yongan 1, Yongan 2, 4, Yongan 3, Yongan 5, Baofeng, Changxing, and Gongyong. Currently, 900,000 of their spindles are in operation. The China Textile Construction Corporation has 700,000 spindles in operation. Both are operating day and night shifts. If not affected by power outages, the total monthly output can reach about 90,000 pieces. According to the statistics of the Cotton Textile Industry Association in the sixth district, the monthly output is 86,056 pieces (based on 20-count yarn). After deducting 26,874 pieces of cotton yarn for the mills' own use in weaving (China Textile Construction Corporation currently has 12,000 looms in operation, and the thirty-four privately-owned yarn mills have about 7,000 looms in operation), 24,000 pieces are allocated to the reproduction industry (dyeing, weaving, knitting, handwork, underwear, handkerchiefs, handmade cotton weaving, etc.), 1,500 pieces are allocated to retailers, and half of the remainder (33,182 pieces) is transported and sold by the mills themselves to other provinces. The other half is sold by the mills to old customers and allocated to the Yarn Merchants Association. Since the yarn market in Shanghai has been under the control of the Textile Management Committee, yarn prices have been stabilized (20-count yarn is limited to 1.75 million yuan per piece). The reproduction industry also has access to affordable allocations, but the allocated quantity is still insufficient and the yarn counts are not suitable (too much coarse yarn), which needs to be improved. As for the yarn mills, since the implementation of the yarn management policy, profits have been greatly reduced. Last year, the highest profit of yarn mills reached about 80% of the cost. Before the implementation of the textile management policy, although it had been reduced, it was still more than 20%. At the end of the year, the profit was less than 10%, and depreciation and other expenses were not included. As for the small yarn mills, the production volume is small, the unit cost is higher, and the profit is even smaller. There are two difficult problems to be solved by the yarn mill industry this year:

(1) Raw Material Problem: There is a limit on the selling price of cotton yarn, but there is no allocation of cotton and no price limit. Although each mill has sufficient inventory at the end of the year, there may be problems after it is used up. Therefore, in order to ensure the effectiveness of the yarn management policy, attention should be paid to the supply of cotton this year.

(2) Electricity Problem: Shanghai's electricity supply cannot be fully supplied. Each mill must be powered off for one or two days a week, which affects work efficiency and increases production costs (because the wages of workers must still be paid during power outages). Therefore, in order to increase production to meet demand, the electricity problem must be solved first this year.

### Coal Prices Soar

Coal market transactions have opened, and prices are higher than before. Bituminous coal is in short supply because the previous application by the industry association to the Fuel Committee for 20,000 tons has not been approved, and only 5,000 tons have been allocated through the Social Bureau. Hongji lump white coal is still 980,000 yuan. The amount of Jiaozuo coal arriving at the station is small, and the price has been reduced to 800,000 yuan. Although coal briquettes have recently been allocated at affordable prices, the cost of each ton of Hongji Coal has reached 400,000 yuan due to the high cost of Hong Kong tickets. The price of coal briquettes from each factory has also increased to 360,000 yuan.

### Ships Continually Transporting Coal from Taiwan to Shanghai

[Our Newspaper] The Manchester and Paterson ships, managed by the Fula Company, each transported 9,380 tons and 9,620 tons of coal from Jilong, for a total of 17,000 tons. One ship unloaded at the Dongjiadu Wharf, and the other was transferred at floating piers No. 32 and No. 33.

### Silk Weaving Industry Still on Strike, Demanding Year-End Bonuses

As of yesterday morning, the silk weaving industry was still in a full strike. The workers originally demanded a year-end bonus of 28 days, but now have compromised to 12 days. However, the capital side still believes that it cannot afford it. According to the capital side, if 28 days are paid, at least 4 billion yuan will need to be paid, and 12 days will also require more than 1 billion yuan. Given the industry's current serious difficulties, it is definitely not a question of whether they are willing to pay, but whether they can pay. Representatives of the capital side discussed this matter with Director Wu of the Social Bureau. The Social Bureau advocated that all factories with surpluses should pay seven days, and those without surpluses should not pay. However, according to the report of the capital side, all factories are losing money, which is equivalent to not paying. The labor side will inevitably not accept this, so the deadlock remains unbroken. The Industry Association of the capital side may convene a membership meeting to resolve the matter. Since the strike, both sides have suffered great losses. The crisis in the silk weaving industry in the past was triggered by the great labor movement in February of last year. If the duration of this strike is extended, the blow to the industry will be even greater.

### Silver and Money Industries to Reopen Today

It is reported that all silver and money industries and markets in the city have been closed for three days from New Year's Day of 1947, and will resume normal operations today (the 4th).

### Leather Goods Stagnant

The leather goods industry is usually the most active and sells best in winter. However, since last winter, the market has been sluggish and prices have been declining. According to people in the industry who spoke to reporters, the main reason is that exports were extremely stagnant last winter. In general, fur products were mostly exported to Europe and the United States. Since the outbreak of the Pacific War, due to transportation interruptions, most leather goods could not be exported. When the victory arrived the year before last and the war ended, the routes to Europe and the United States were unblocked, so leather merchants competed to transport the fur goods accumulated over the years to foreign countries, resulting in an oversupply in foreign markets. It is reported that the fur inventory in the United States is sufficient for two years, so since the beginning of last winter, market prices have gradually softened and there has been no improvement. Looking back at the country, the cost of domestic products has increased day by day, and there is no profit to be made from exports. Internally, they cannot withstand the threat of high interest rates. As a result, many leather merchants lost money last winter and lamented their fate. Their business was the most depressed year in history.

### Production Loan Review Committee - Eighth Regular Meeting

Over Twenty Loan Cases Approved

[This newspaper's report] The Provisional Review Committee for the Four Banks Joint Office's Raw Salt Industry Loan convened its eighth regular meeting at the Bank of China yesterday afternoon at 4 p.m. The meeting was attended by over twenty people, including Chairman Huo Baoshu, committee members Li Huosun, Xu Jiyu, Shen Rixin,  Runxiang, and expert consultants. Liang, the Deputy Minister of Finance, and Xu Baiyuan, Secretary-General of the Four Banks Joint Office, also attended, with Chairman Huo presiding. After discussion, over twenty loan applications were approved, with total approved loans amounting to several billion yuan, it is said.

### Jiangsu Agricultural Bank Increases Funding to Promote Grain Storage Operations

The Jiangsu Provincial Farmers Bank previously signed a 6 billion yuan cooperation loan agreement with the Central Farmers Bank of China. The Central Farmers Bank has successively allocated 1.98 billion yuan, which, together with 20% of funds raised by the Jiangsu Provincial Farmers Bank itself, totals over 2.4 billion yuan. These funds have already been fully disbursed. Recently, due to the Central Farmers Bank's failure to allocate the agreed loan funds, and with the autumn harvest underway, grain prices have not risen in line with commodity prices, resulting in low grain prices hurting farmers. In order to alleviate the farmers' difficulties and fulfill its mission, the bank has reportedly allocated 1 billion yuan from its operating funds to be distributed to various branches to specifically handle grain storage and mortgage operations.

### Compilation and Establishment of Reclaimed Enemy and Puppet Textile Factories Total Over Seventy Units

[This newspaper's report] According to reliable statistics, the China Textile Construction Corporation has taken over enemy and puppet textile factories across the country, including Shanghai, Qingdao, Tianjin, and the four northeastern provinces, totaling over seventy units. Currently, apart from the units that have been returned or transferred, sixty-five units remain. A breakdown is as follows: Cotton textile factories: 21 in Shanghai (of which 17 are operational; the Nichihua No. 1 and No. 2 factories have no weaving machinery and are now converted into the Sixth Warehouse; the Nichihua No. 5 factory and the Tongdian No. 1 factory, Gongda No. 2 factory, are either occupied or leased by military authorities). 8 in Qingdao, 7 in Tianjin, 3 in the Northeast, totaling 39 units. Wool textile factories: 5 in Shanghai, 1 in Tianjin, totaling 6 units. Printing and dyeing factories: 6 in Shanghai (the Guichuan and Huimei factories now only have empty buildings). 1 in Qingdao, 1 in Tianjin, totaling 8 units. Jute manufacturing factories: 2 (the Dongya and Nichihua factories merged into the First Jute Manufacturing Factory; the Nichihua factory is currently occupied), totaling 2 units. Silk textile factories: 1 in Shanghai, 1 in Tianjin, totaling 2 units. Knitting factories: 1 in Shanghai, 1 in Qingdao, totaling 2 units. Tape factories: 1 in Shanghai (the Xiaolin and Shanghai factories merged into one), totaling 1 unit. Machinery factories: 2 in Shanghai (the Neiwaiba and Zhenhua factories merged into one; the other is the Toyota Machinery Factory), 1 in Qingdao, 1 in Tianjin, totaling 4 units. Chemical factories: 1 in Qingdao, totaling 1 unit. The above existing factories total 65 units. Of the returned or transferred units, cotton textile factories: 2 in Shanghai (the Hengfeng and Dafeng factories), 1 in Qingdao (not the Xinhua Yarn Factory), totaling 3 units. Wool textile factory: 1 in Shanghai (the Huaxing factory), totaling 1 unit. Machinery factories: 4 in Shanghai (of which the Far East Steel Wire Cloth, Toyota Automatic Vehicle, and Dongya factories were transferred; the new factory has property issues). Totaling 4 units. Weaving factory: 1 in Shanghai (the Dachang Weaving Factory; the factory buildings were returned, but the machinery was transferred by the Textile Construction Corporation to other factories), totaling one unit. The above returned or transferred factories total 9 units.

### Scarcity of Fresh Eggs

Recently, the source of fresh chicken and duck eggs in this city from the Jiangbei area has been extremely scarce. In addition, with the Lunar New Year approaching, demand is particularly high. General merchants believe that in the past, the market price in Shanghai fluctuated uncertainly, resulting in significant losses. Due to transportation inconveniences, goods from distant places cannot arrive in time. Although good prices are heard of now, it is still empty of goods. Currently, the market price of duck eggs has risen by around 50,000 to 60,000 yuan per dan.

### Shou Jingwei Returns from Taiwan, Discusses the Taiwan Tea Joint Operations

Shou Jingwei, Standing Director of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, went to Taiwan on the 21st of last month to plan the establishment of a China Tea Joint Operations Branch Company in Taiwan to seek the export of Taiwan tea. Mr. Shou has now completed his business and returned to Shanghai the day before yesterday. He told the Central News Agency reporter his feelings about the trip: (1) During my stay in Taiwan, I spent most of my time in Taipei and Taichung. In the past, Taiwan's economy was entirely in a colonial state and could be divided into industrial Japan and agricultural Taiwan, that is, Japan took primary products (raw materials) from Taiwan, and Japan processed and refined them. After the victory, the Chief Executive Officer's Office cooperated with current national policy, worked hard to govern, and explored ways to build a new Taiwan. Some people advocated that Japan dismantle and transfer refining industrial machinery to Taiwan, or that the United States add a portion. Between these two options, the Resources Committee Relief and Rehabilitation Administration branch and the Chief Executive Officer's Office reached a proper and concrete plan through consultation to meet actual needs and will be implemented soon. (2) Taiwan Oolong black tea had huge exports to the United States before the war, and the Mitsui Bussan Co., Ltd. was the operating center. Now, the Taiwan Tea Specialty Company and the Taiwan Provincial Tea Co., Ltd. are preparing separately. The above two companies agree to join the upcoming China Tea Art Joint Operations Branch Company in the future. Regarding future operating issues, close contacts have been established with local financial institutions and provincial and business-operated tea companies to take the same approach and prepare to promote Taiwan's tea export trade. The process is very good. (3) Taiwan's climate is mild, especially in the Taipei and Taichung areas. It is comparable to Hollywood in the United States and is very suitable for the environment of temporary filming locations. Our country's film entrepreneurs are paying attention to it. It is a pity that there is a lack of local film art talent, which cannot be fully utilized. Moreover, educational and industrial films are easy to develop in Taiwan, because the villages in Taiwan have national schools and public hall facilities, which are most suitable for projecting 16mm educational and industrial short films. From this point of view, Taiwan will be more suitable for the standard of electro-chemical education experimental areas in the future.

### Decline in Sales of Wool Yarn

Sales of wool yarn have been very sluggish recently due to the off-season. Recently, futures from various factories have been sold out. Due to tight credit, various sales shops are vying to sell to meet financial obligations. Therefore, various daily necessities have been rising in price, but the market price of wool yarn has been unable to rise and has remained stable. However, the raw material and labor costs of various factories have increased significantly compared to before. Due to limited slow sales, factory prices cannot be increased. We must wait until after the end of the Lunar New Year, when sales pick up, and the price of goods can be expected to rise.

### Adjustment of Commodity Tax - Actual Revenue of Over 400 Billion Last Year

The commodity tax rate will be adjusted in early this month. Since the commodity tax is collected ad valorem, it is adjusted once every three months as usual. In 1946, the actual revenue from commodity tax was 420 billion yuan. After the figures from various regions are reported, the total is expected to reach 450 billion yuan.

### Price Index Individual Life Insurance to Be Implemented from New Year's Day

Since the China Trust Bureau launched group life insurance with price index, its business has developed rapidly. In just three months, the insurance amount has exceeded 20 billion yuan. Recently, individuals in various regions have requested to take out this life insurance policy due to its excellent method. In order to meet the needs, the bureau has specifically increased individual life insurance with price index, which will accept applications from January 1, 1947. Yesterday, the reporter visited the person in charge of the life insurance department of the bureau, who told the details. The main points are recorded as follows:

(1) The biggest differences between this individual life insurance with price index and group life insurance with price index are: First, the former is collected and paid out by age, while the latter adopts an average premium system. Second, the former is charged quarterly, while the latter is charged monthly. As for the low premium rate and large guarantee, both are the same.

(2) There are still two methods: Type A "Cost of Living Index Unit" and Type B "Capital Insurance Amount". The insurance amount of Type A automatically increases or decreases with the monthly cost of living index. After the insurance of Type B, the insured can also apply to increase or decrease the basic insurance amount depending on the price changes.

(3) Type A can be insured up to 20 cost of living index units (taking December as an example, it is equivalent to 11.4 million yuan in national currency). Type B is 500,000 yuan as a basic insurance amount, and can be insured up to 20 basic insurance amounts (that is, 10 million yuan).

(4) A term life insurance and disability insurance system is still adopted. All accidental injuries or deaths due to illness, or disabilities caused by accidental injuries, are covered.

### World Games Results Will Be Diminished The World Food Shortage Threatens Athletes from Various Countries

[Reported by Meier, a reporter from the United Press Agency in London, on the 2nd of this newspaper] This year's world food shortage threatens the development of many famous athletes. Therefore, the World Games to be held in London in 1948 will become a contest between the "well-fed" and the "underfed."

According to the results of the United Press survey in Europe: the representatives selected by "breadbasket" countries such as the United States, Switzerland, and South American countries will be physically superior to the representatives of countries lacking strong food. Swedish sports experts frankly admitted that the country's athletes are strong and physically strong, and the lineup is strong. The main reason is that Sweden has not experienced wartime famine, while other participating countries have. German and Japanese athletes were not invited to participate in the 1948 World Games. In fact, their abilities are also inferior to those before the war. Dr. Dien, a member of the German Olympic Committee, said: The food shortage has created a sad situation. He cited an example. In 1936, the world javelin champion Stock threw 236 feet, but he now weighs 35 pounds lighter, and the throwing record is only 180 feet.

Several European countries struggling in starvation are seeking more rations for athletes, but to no avail. In Belgium, steak is being used as a prize for outstanding amateur athletes.

Some British sports trainers have come up with a clever idea to send athletes to Ireland to "fatten up" because the British government has refused to give more rations to athletes.

In France, Ba Guad, the director of the National Sports Academy, explained that French athletes were malnourished during the occupation and after the war, so their physical strength has greatly deteriorated.

### Returning to the Land: A Visit to Taichung Agricultural College

— Taichung Air Dispatch, 10th. Our Correspondent in Taiwan: Yang Yu

Looking out over the island of Taiwan, apart from the central region, which contains endless, deep forests, forming an undeveloped wilderness, the western part, from a straight line drawn from the northern end to the southern end, is a plain that perpetually yields extraordinarily abundant crops. Therefore, when Japan ruled Taiwan, its economic policy was entirely centered on Taiwan as an agricultural colony. Although in the late stages of the war, the Japanese in Taiwan struggled for a while with "industrialization," they ultimately failed to lay a deeply rooted foundation due to the inherent contradictions of wanting to exploit and consider things at the same time. The comparatively more successful efforts were still limited to agriculture-related industries. Here, I would like to introduce a school that the Japanese originally used to specifically cultivate agricultural talent, which may offer insight into the kind of force Japan used to manage Taiwan from this angle.

One Hundred Train Cars to Transport Equipment

In May of the eighth year of the Republic (1919), the Taiwan Governor-General's Office established an Agricultural and Forestry Vocational School in Taipei, enrolling students to provide specialized agricultural and forestry education. In the eleventh year of the Republic (1922), it established a Higher Agricultural and Forestry School according to the Vocational School Ordinance. After the Taipei Imperial University was founded in March of the sixteenth year of the Republic (1927), this school was merged into it and renamed the affiliated Agricultural and Forestry Vocational Department. By the 32nd year of the Republic (1943), considering that the area in Taipei was too small to conduct large-scale agricultural and forestry experiments, and also because the Agricultural and Forestry Vocational Department and the Imperial University's Faculty of Agriculture had practical conflicts, and further because Japan shouted the slogan of "Taiwan as a Base for Southern Advancement" for the purpose of engaging in war, it needed to strengthen its understanding of agricultural and forestry undertakings in the South Seas region as a foundation for future aggression. It was imperative to find a more suitable location. At this time, Taichung, which had always prided itself as the "Capital of Culture," was the first to respond to this plan: Taichung is a developed agricultural area; Taichung is closer to the tropics. Therefore, local people stepped forward, saying that as long as the Taiwan Governor-General's Office was willing to move the school to Taichung, all expenses and land could be entirely provided by the Taichung region. Under these various convenient conditions, the school finally left Taipei, using 114 train cars to move all the instruments and equipment to Dingqiaozitou in the southern suburbs of Taichung City. After only four months of work, the entire forty-two modern school buildings, comprising two hundred and one rooms, were completed in this "Capital of Culture." The school plaque reading "Taichung Agricultural and Forestry Vocational School of the Taiwan Governor-General's Office" was hung at the main entrance. Many outstanding professors, most of whom had done extensive research in the South Seas, were mobilized and concentrated here, unfolding an important link in "multi-faceted agricultural management."

In Taipei, the agricultural land that the Agricultural Vocational School could use was only about 100 acres. However, in Taichung, in addition to the school's own base of more than 500 acres, there were also more than 170 acres of farmland in the suburbs, totaling more than 700 acres. This special superiority in material conditions was indeed the greatest driving force for the school's continuous progress.

Only Eleven Days of Classes Last Year

In the late stages of the war, the fate of collapse was obviously brought to the Japanese. Eight or nine out of ten students here were sent to the front lines. Many professors were also scattered to the South Seas and southern China for so-called investigations. This newborn child suffered from severe acquired maladjustment. In the first half of last year, it only held eleven days of classes. Everything was suspended invisibly. Large areas of farmland were rented to nearby farmers for cultivation, and the school's own fields could only be watched as they were abandoned. Therefore, when Dean Zhou Jin-san was ordered to come and take over in November of last year, he first took on the responsibility of restoring the school. He actively reorganized the farms while continuing to enroll students and hold classes, and has not stopped for a single day until now.

In the past, the Japanese greatly discriminated against Taiwanese compatriots. Taking this place as an example, among the more than ten faculty and staff members, only four or five were local Taiwanese, and the total number of graduates over the years was 962, of which 920 were Japanese and only 42 were Taiwanese. Similarly, during enrollment, Japanese students had an average one-in-four chance of admission, but Taiwanese students had only one in thirty. Both teaching and learning were artificially restricted in this way, and the rest can be imagined.

There are now a total of 215 students, all of whom are local Taiwanese. I sincerely hope that the Taiwanese people can learn from the pain in this school with such a foundation and seize this opportunity firmly.

Emphasizing Research and Cultivating Talent

Those who work in many agricultural agencies in Taiwan are entirely graduates of agricultural science from universities in Japan. As for the 9920 graduates from here, they are also included, totaling more than 4,000 people. Unfortunately, of the forty-two Taiwanese graduates, none were accepted by any agencies after leaving school. Lost and misguided, they changed their careers. To date, these more than 4,000 agricultural workers have been returning to Japan in batches and will all be gone soon. Therefore, Taiwan's agricultural and forestry departments have been greatly affected. Therefore, Dean Zhou expressed this: The school's facilities are good, the environment is good, and we are determined to train a group of agricultural and forestry cadres so that they can participate in practical work as soon as they leave school, whether in Taiwan or in the country. As for the teaching staff, the most difficult problem at present is that there are only four Japanese professors left, and the professors hired domestically have been coming to Taiwan successively, but it is still necessary to continue to strengthen them. Looking at the "Regulations of the Governor-General's Agricultural and Forestry Vocational School," the practical experiments and internships for students in each department total more than 525 times in three academic years. In terms of teaching, there are also very sophisticated laboratories for research. Therefore, research is the main focus here, and teaching is secondary. It is a pleasure for domestic professors to come here to cultivate talents for the country and to conduct research for themselves!

Changing Departments to Faculties to Expand the Scope

The Agricultural College originally had three departments: the Department of Agronomy (including subjects such as mathematics, biology, physical chemistry, tropical meteorology, soil and fertilizer, crops, horticulture, crop protection, breeding, animal husbandry, forestry, agricultural machinery, agricultural civil engineering, agricultural product manufacturing, agricultural economics, tropical agriculture, biochemistry, and applied biology), the Department of Forestry (including subjects such as mathematics, physical chemistry, plants and trees, forest animals and insects, tropical meteorology, geology and soil, surveying, tree measurement, afforestation, tropical forestry, forest protection, wood science and technology, forest utilization, forest engineering, sand control, forest product manufacturing, forestry management, forestry policy, colonization theory, crops, and animal husbandry), and the Department of Agricultural Chemistry (including subjects such as mathematics, physical chemistry, biology, geology and soil, fertilizer, crops and horticulture, animal husbandry, analytical chemistry, physics, biochemistry, applied microbiology, agricultural agents, nutrition and food chemistry, inorganic manufacturing chemistry, agricultural product manufacturing chemistry, electricity and machinery, fuel chemistry, biopharmaceutical chemistry, colonization theory, and factory management). From September next year, it is planned to change the departments to faculties and also prepare to add five to six more faculties. Regarding these points, Dean Zhou explained: "Taiwan University does not have a Forestry Department, but looking at the actual situation in Taiwan, that department is very important. The plains of western Taiwan are often flooded because of flash floods, which wash down countless sand and gravel from the upper reaches, turning fertile land into barren land. Therefore, in the future, we must devote ourselves to the construction of protective forests, and the scope of the Forestry Department must be expanded from next year. As for the Department of Agronomy, because Taiwan was not allowed to have large-scale agriculture under Japanese colonial rule in the past, but the farmland in Taiwan is suitable for large-scale agricultural management. In the future, in order to promote the large-scale agricultural plan based on the Three Principles of the People, special attention must be paid to this department. There is currently a very urgent demand for agricultural chemistry, because Taiwan itself is a national arts and crafts zone, and the future development can be expected. The last item is animal husbandry, which we also want to pay attention to in the future."

Automated Water Supply for Irrigated Crops

I visited the various places here with Dean Zhou and Mr. Ge Zhiyuan, a famous agricultural science professor who recently came from Fujian, and talked with several Japanese professors about their experiences and achievements in agricultural research over the years. Because most of the professors have already left Taiwan and returned to Japan, or are preparing to leave, I could not obtain more detailed information in a hurry, so I can only give readers a simple introduction to what I heard and saw.

Among the more than 200 rooms in the Morning College, research laboratories occupy 83 rooms. We first visited the laboratory of plant pathology, which was studied by Professor Okabe. He injected various germs into the stalks of tobacco plants, like giving vaccinations. In the corridor, pots of injured tobacco plants were everywhere. Some had completely withered, while others were turning yellow. Then, he would observe its reaction and calculate the time it took to wither. Because Professor Okabe was not there, it was impossible to know his research process and results.

Professor Tamai studies plant physiology. Wearing worn-out clothes, he buried himself in the laboratory, working hard. He talked with the reporters the longest. It is worth introducing that he designed a "self-recording water absorption device" with many screws, iron sheets, copper wires, and glass tubes to measure the water consumption of plants. It can measure the degree of evaporation and infiltration on the soil surface and record it scientifically. The principle of this device is to use a ring-shaped mercury tube to connect the water storage tank with the consumption part of the plant. When the plant absorbs water, the mercury tube causes an imbalance, which then drives the switch of the electromagnet to block the water source. Then, it automatically opens the valve to let the water flow in again, cycling continuously. A self-recording needle draws a curve with ups and downs, showing the evaporation and infiltration conditions. Many students have now made this device based on his model for practical application. According to this automatic record, it can be known that the water absorption and evaporation of plants are directly proportional to the temperature and sunlight. Usually, the water consumption is greatest from 12:00 noon to 3:00 p.m. Professor Tamai specially conducted an experiment during a solar eclipse five years ago, which proved that this conclusion is completely reliable.

There is also a "horizontal moistening tank automatic irrigation device."

As long as the water column of the instrument is raised, lengthened, or shortened, the most appropriate amount of water needed for plant growth can be seen. Because the degree of appropriate amount of water is different for various plants, this device can be used for scientific experiments.

As for measuring the growth rate of plants during the irrigation period, there is also a "official recording growth meter" that can be used for recording. These many designs are really very valuable and practical devices in terms of plant physiology. We hope that this ability to emphasize research and creativity can be maintained permanently.

Extracting Lubricating Oil from Shark Oil

Professor Hisaka studies aquatic animals. He used a type of squalene fat produced near Taiwan to refine lubricating oil. He also took out a bottle of yellow finished product for us to see. At the same time, according to him, he is now studying the extraction of enzymes from useless fish bellies and has already achieved results. However, he is about to return to his country, and he hopes that successors will conduct more thorough research on this work.

"Shi Taifei Anding" is a special lung disease medicine produced in Taiwan, but the research on this medicine has been stagnating at the research stage and has not been able to determine that it has special effects. Professor Jinbing, who is retained in the Agricultural College, is studying the composition and cultivation methods of this medicine. Professor Jinbing was teaching that day, so there was no time to talk to him. According to Dean Zhou, he has unique research on the changes, composition, and pigments of tobacco after fermentation. Therefore, the tobacco factory of the Monopoly Bureau specially hired him as a consultant.

In the special crop laboratory, there were many instruments and books. Professor Okabe was also not there. He has a lot of research on rice seeds. Not long ago, many rice seeds were sent from the South Seas, asking him to classify them. Next to a microscope, there were countless glass slides, all with slices of rice grains attached to them, which were prepared to observe its chromosomes and determine its variety. Outside the house, there were more than a dozen pots of rice, which were said to be testing the crossbreeding of various different varieties to see the results.

Testing the Fire Resistance of Wood

Professor Kana, the director of the Forestry Department, studied forestry in Germany and is a professor with experience and knowledge. He designed a device himself that can test the resistance of each wood block of a certain volume when it is split, and then measure the structure, specific gravity, hardness, elasticity, and water content of the wood. There is also a device used to test the fire resistance of wood. A wood block of a certain volume is placed in a long tube for burning, and a needle next to it can indicate the time and resistance. In the application of wood, some hope that it is easy to burn, while others hope the opposite. Now with this device, it is very convenient to have a basis for selection. Finally, I saw a wood slicer that is unique in Taiwan and can even be said to be non-existent in China. It can be cut into thin slices for research under a microscope. This precision machinery has contributed a high degree of functionality to research and experimentation.

More Than a Thousand Research Papers

After a hurried visit, everyone talked casually in Dean Zhou's office. He said that the most commendable thing is the abundance of equipment - there are more than 12,700 pieces of instruments and equipment, and more than 20,000 books and periodicals. The second is the research spirit of each professor. In the past two years, statistics show that the professors here have published more than "a thousand" research papers. This is truly an amazing record. Dean Zhou said that he will sort them out soon and introduce them to the public at home and abroad.

After saying goodbye to Dean Zhou and others, I saw a large oil painting at the gate, with a young farmer wearing a bamboo hat, bare feet, and holding an adze, writing a line of English "Back to Laud." I hope that the young people in the country will, under such a great summons, move towards "the land!"

### United Nations Scientific and Cultural Organization

— Paris Air Dispatch, 20th. Our Special Correspondent in Paris: Hong Fu

The establishment of the United Nations Scientific and Cultural Conference will maintain lasting peace for the whole world. For China, it will break through financial constraints and introduce it to the global trend. If the Chinese people want to cure ignorance and poverty and achieve the great cause of saving the country through science, then scientific facilities are more important than culture and education. The outlines of its plans are revealed as follows:

(1) Divide the world into ten regions, each with a scientific cooperation station: (1) East Asia, (2) Australia, (3) Southeast Asia, (4) India, (5) Middle East including Africa, (6) Southern Africa and the Sahara, (7) Eastern Europe, (8) North America, (9) Central and South America, (10) Western Europe. The station in Paris also serves as the general station for scientific cooperation affairs around the world. (2) Exchange scientific news, books, and newspapers and magazines around the world, circulate official scientific publications of various countries, and prepare summaries and reports for each country on several important issues in the scientific community around the world. New theories and new methods that need to be translated into various languages are merged into one place so that it is not necessary to seek them separately, and it is not necessary to do one thing twice. Or, for individual scientists, seek a certain page of a certain book or newspaper for research and material collection, without having to subscribe to the entire copy. The above two points are called the rationalization of the use of scientific publications to avoid the accidental consumption of human and financial resources. Also, during the war, all scientific publications in various countries were either restricted by the environment, printed but not in large quantities, or spread but not widely, or were damaged, and few survived. It is urgent to apply photography and lithography for duplication, or to make microfilm, which is light in weight and small in size, and spread it widely. Also, scientists have dissertations and rare writings, which are not popular and are sometimes only sold as dozens or hundreds of copies of non-commercial Tires a Part. Those who like to collect books and newspapers on various subjects sometimes unfortunately pass away, and their families do not know how to preserve them, discard them, or burn them, which is very regrettable. The Scientific and Cultural Association plans to collect them in various ways and keep them for scholars' occasional needs. In addition, the collection and dissemination of new scientific harmonies, the pursuit of convenient and sophisticated document arrangement and retrieval methods, biological standardization such as Serums, Vitanes, and Hormones, the mutual exchange of medical and agricultural model varieties between countries, and the development of marine resources are all the latest undertakings in the scientific community. (3) To seek standardization in the manufacture of scientific instruments so that the products and accessories of various countries are the same in size and other differences, and to collect catalogs, price lists, and tax amounts of manufacturers in various countries to make it easier for purchasers to find goods and reduce taxes. (4) Create a scientific world language that is similar to Latin but convenient for various countries to use, and establish a scientific post office with a directory of names and addresses of world-renowned scientists so that experts can be consulted for questions at any time. At the same time, promote scientific broadcasting and collect scientific films from around the world. For example, the salt wells in Sichuan, China, which are more than 2,000 years old, are the most precious scientific film masterpieces. (5) Facilitate the travel of scientists, such as establishing a scientists' association in major cities of various countries that is similar to a hotel and a guild, issuing preferential certificates and subsidies for scientific travel, and establishing scientific exploration trips and bird research stations. (6) Establish a registry of scientific institutions and scientists around the world, release a network of research collaborations around the world, and place observatories and laboratories around the world under international supervision to receive funding. (7) In addition to commercial attachés, intelligence attachés, and naval, air, and army attachés, embassies should add scientific attachés. It is said that the British Embassy in Chongqing and the Australian Embassy in the Russian capital have already implemented this. (8) Devote efforts to exploring scientific knowledge related to the world's economic development, such as establishing an international resource survey agency in cooperation with the United Nations Economic and Social Council to thoroughly investigate the production of fuel minerals and other resources in various regions. (9) Use ships, trains, or open wagons carrying goods to hold exhibitions of scientific new knowledge, circulating between villages and cities.

Secondly, the agenda of the first conference, which is the division of labor for routine official duties, consists of five groups: (1) Qualification Review Group, represented by Li Shuhua, (2) Staff Appointment Group, represented by Cheng Tianfang, (3) Rules of Procedure Group, represented by Professor Chen Yuan, (4) General Affairs Group, represented by Zhao Yuanren, (5) Drafting Group, represented by Zhao Yuanren and Li Shuhua. The most important work is the Planning Committee, represented by Cheng Tianfang, Assistant Representative Counselor Qu Shiying (Junong), and Secretary Ye Junjian, with six groups set up under it: (A) Education Group, attended by Dr. Qu Shiying, Wang Chengxu, Qian Dashi's female daughter, Lilly Zhaolin, and three others; (B) Public Education, i.e., publicity, news, film, and broadcasting, attended by Dr. Zhao Yuanren, Xiao Yu, Zhou Lin, Qian Nengxin, and Ye Junjian; (C) Science Group, attended by representatives Li Shuhua and Zhu Kezhen, Dr. Wang Dezhao, and Qian Sanqiang; (D) Social Science Group, including philosophy and humanitarian research, attended by Cheng Tianfang, Qu Shiying, Kuang Zixiu, Mrs. Hua Nan, Yuan Milly Xingjie, Liang Fangzhong, and five others; (E) Creative Arts, including painting, sculpture, script writing, architectural design, interior decoration, attended by representative Chen Yuan, Xie Kangzhou, Yi Yu, Dr. Ling Shuhua, Mrs. Ye Fengjian, and five others; (F) Library Museum Group, also known as the Exhibition Group, attended by Hu Tianshi and Zhou Linyu Dr. The second item is the Finance and Law Committee, represented by Li Shuhua, Assistant Representative Counselor Xiao Yu, and Secretary Liang Fangzhong, with two groups set up under it: (Zi) The Finance Group, which discusses funding issues for the implementation of all the above plans, is attended by Li Haiye, Xiao Yu, Zhao Junxin, and Liang Fangshen; (Chou) The Legal Group, attended by Li Shuhua, Zhao Junxin, and Zheng Zixiu. In addition, there is also a temporary Relief and Reconstruction Committee for post-war cultural and educational work, attended by representative Zhu Kezhen, Assistant Representative Counselor Qian Youdian, and Secretary Gong Chengxu and Qian Sanqiang. The morning meetings are held from 10:30 a.m., and the afternoon meetings are held from 3:00 p.m., all in the conference rooms of the Unaffiliated Cultural and Educational Bureau Building. Forty-five countries are expected to attend, with the nomination of members of the delegation from each country, but only the delegation members from the four major powers of the United States, Britain, France, and China can be regular members who must attend each meeting. All remaining vacancies are won by other countries through competition. On the fifth floor of the Unaffiliated Cultural and Educational Bureau Building, each country's representatives has an office, of which rooms 552 to 553 are the Chinese representative's office. Before and after the meeting, members of the delegation gather here, and there is a French female stenographer nearby to assist in telephone reception and other duties. Each representative stays at the Hotel George V near the Chinese Embassy in France. Every night at 8:00 p.m., a preparatory meeting is held in the hotel to discuss the events of the day's meeting. Chinese representatives speak at every meeting, and their greatest hope is to translate as many books left by ancient Chinese civilization into Western languages as possible. Whenever I visit the conference, I attend and listen. As when the conference elected the vice-chairman (Chinese chief representative Dr. Zhao Yuanren was elected, a recent photo of Dr. Zhao is attached), and the US Deputy Foreign Secretary Hon. William Benton delivered an important speech, the speaker on the platform or speaker's platform spoke into the microphones, which transmitted to the sound box in the box building, broadcasting the entire conference hall, and the sound was increased and more clear. This is a new scientific achievement. The sound heard at the Scientific and Cultural Conference is much better than the sound recorded by silent films, and it is also a great improvement compared to the sound released at the Paris Peace Conference at the Palace of Versailles more than a month ago. This scientific achievement is amazing.

During this meeting, members of the Chinese delegation rarely slept at night due to external socializing and internal meeting discussions. On the evening of December 9 at 9:00 p.m., they invited Chinese and foreign guests to enjoy a good evening, Soir'es, at the lamaison de alchirnie of the Paris Chemist's Association, hiring Ms. Zhou Xiaoyan, who studied music in France, to sing Western songs, and Ms. Li Xianmin to play the piano. The splendor of culture and education was at its peak for a time. Qu Junong, the dean of the Rural Construction College among the delegation members, and Liang Fangzhong, who came to Europe from the United States, are both major collectors of books. Zhou Linyu is knowledgeable and talks freely about Paris. It is only then that we know that the active Bai Tu is a complete book. Wang Chengxu has delicate surgery and likes to help others. The representatives Zhao, Li, Cheng, Zhu, and Chen are mostly white-haired, and at first glance, they are all academic leaders with very deep years.

Spring and Autumn

### Soul Love

— Zhao Qingge

The night was as still as a pool of stagnant water. I gently hung up a curtain, letting a crescent moon coyly kiss my heart!

The stove fire flickered with warmth, the wintersweet on the desk exuded a continuous fragrance, and the radio broadcast Guo Yang's affectionate violin music. I was immersed in this poetic atmosphere!

From that brilliance, that fragrance, and the sound of music, beautiful souls appeared one by one. These souls all reached out to me, but none of them approached me. Between us, many low walls and many moats vaguely stood, separating us! Who built these low walls? Who created these moats? "Ugly reality! Ugly reality!" my soul told me.

I pondered sadly about how to overcome that "ugly reality"? I also wondered: why do these beautiful souls willingly tolerate that ugly reality?

Suddenly, in the darkness, I felt my soul embrace a group of beautiful souls surrounding me, and they began to murmur to each other. I stared at them in bewilderment, listening to them.

The first beautiful soul had a pair of affectionate yet timid eyes, a passionate yet melancholic heart. It held a pen full of flowers. It shook the pen, and the flowers scattered, its dazzling light illuminating the entire universe! Finally, it held a bouquet of flowers and prostrated at the feet of my soul, saying as if reciting a poem:

"Give me dew, my rain! Without you, my pen will wither and no longer bloom with so many radiant flowers!"

"But, there is a wall between us, a moat!" my soul replied to it.

"Yes, this wall, this moat, separates us! Why didn't we meet earlier, before the construction of this wall, this moat? But, Silone tells us: 'The most important thing about love is not the union of two bodies. The fundamental thing is to maintain a good friendship regardless of distance. Those companions who have been together for thirty or forty years are like prisoners chained together. Although they eat at the same table and sleep in the same bed, it looks beautiful, but in fact, their souls do not know each other, or are even enemies. Will they be happy?' That's absolutely right, they will never be happy! However, suppose two tacit souls can stay together for endless years, wouldn't they have no sorrow? Therefore, I must find a way to remove this wall and fill this moat! I beg you, wait for me with the greatest perseverance, and believe in me with the highest emotion! Wait until death, and love until death! Don't worry about how long the separation is, or how big the separating space is, just embrace the word 'love' and imitate those saints in legends who sacrificed for love, endure suffering, and remain steadfast! One day, God will quietly pull us together, like the birds of paradise in the sky, like the entwined branches on the ground! , This is not just love, it's madness! Just as you are not only my rain, but also my woman; my sister; my wife, my mother; my Holy Mother; everything! Say, are you willing to be a saint who sacrifices for love in a legend, are you willing to wait for a nearly illusory beautiful dream for a long time, invest your youth, even your life! Because—'

'Because I love you!' my soul said without hesitation.

'Great soul! You will make my pen bloom with an immortal flower of love, this flower is our common life!'"

What a moving poem! After the first beautiful soul finished speaking, it happily and fearfully began its work—the work of fighting that wall, that moat.

Then, the second beautiful soul walked towards my soul. It had a pair of teary eyes, a sincere and bewildered heart! It was as thin as a withered, noble old pine tree, surrounded by a pile of books, as if the books were its protective leaves! It pleaded to my soul so sadly and tremblingly:

"My God! I am like your shadow, silently following you for fourteen years! I always wanted to get close to you, even to possess you—"

"'But, there is a wall between us, a moat'!" My soul answered it with the same words it had used to answer the first beautiful soul, without waiting for it to finish speaking.

"So, I was destroyed by this wall, this moat. But, God gave me a great revelation, it gave me hope! It taught me to expect; to quietly expect, to expect a miracle to come one day, to resurrect me, and you will belong to me. Can you imagine what that miracle is? Forgive my cruelty, allow me to tell you frankly: I am silently praying to use the power of God to make your head full of white hair as soon as possible; and I also pray for the power of God to make you blind; or lame; then, I can accompany your lonely old age; I can be your eyes; replace your legs! Moreover, I pray that God will grant me a quick death, but let my soul not die, like the ghosts in legends, with memories; with spirituality; crossing that wall, that moat; in the darkness, I still love you; I still follow your left and right; I am still like your shadow. When the night is quiet, and you are pondering at your desk, I will appear next to your lonely lamp. I will still make tea for you as before; light incense for you; tell you many thrilling, bizarre, and tender stories; then you write, and I will grind ink for you! When you are troubled, I will imitate puppies and kittens, jumping around you until you laugh! When you are angry, I will kneel at your feet, and let you slap my cheeks. When you yourself are bullied, or others are bullied and you are indignant, I can turn into a fierce demon to take revenge on the person you hate, to satisfy your sense of justice. When you are tired, I will gently pluck my mandolin, play the tunes you composed, and lull you to rest. In short, I will dedicate everything, just to make you happy, happy! I want to make you live forever, beautiful, glorious forever! Will you scold me for this being an absurd dream? Oh, please grant me a decision, grant me this absurd dream, my God!"

"Why have such cruel desires?" My soul asked with an uneasy look.

"Because only in this way can I get you."

"What a strange love!" My soul said moved. "No one else in the world loves me like this, they all want me to be young; they want me to be healthy; they want me to be beautiful, only you, but you want me to be old, you want me to be disabled, you want me to be ugly! They all want to get me alive, but you want to get me after death, you fantasize too beautifully, my shadow! Just dream, even if it is indeed close to absurd, but as long as you feel that in the absurdity you have already received the happiness you yearn for."

The second beautiful soul happily and quietly retreated behind my soul, and a whirlwind of heat warmed the depths of my soul.

At this time, the third beautiful soul assaulted my soul. At first, my soul felt a little unfamiliar with it, but soon it shook hands with it under its bright, penetrating gaze! Its heart was pure and honest, as bright as an artist's clean canvas. It painted all the beautiful things in the universe on its canvas. It did not tolerate a trace of shadow, a speck of dust. It undoubtedly completed a masterpiece of genius! But it was not satisfied, it told me;

"Genius needs endless inspiration to inspire performance! When I discovered that 'inspiration' is concentrated on you, I felt an urgent need for you!"

"But there is a wall between us, a moat!" My soul repeated this sentence for the third time.

"Therefore, I only wish to meet again in the next life! Please protect me and transform me into your pen, your ink, anything that you cannot lack, and cannot live without! In that next life that has neither a wall nor a moat, there is a bright sun; there is a peaceful moon; there are beautiful flowers and plants; there are tranquil mountains and rivers; there are kind animals; there is no darkness; there is no war; there is no ugliness; there is no noise; there is no sin! Let our rebirth have only joy and no sorrow; only pride and no melancholy; only laughter and no crying; only love and no hate; only happiness and no pain! We are like living in a painting, a painting by Vinci (Leonardo do Vinci); a piece of music, a piece of Mozart's music; a drama; a drama by Ibsen; a novel, a novel by Tolstoy; a poem, a poem by Dante!"

"This is too ethereal, too illusory! More ethereal and more illusory than a dream or death!" My soul said to itself with emotion.

"No, as long as you believe, you think; there will be a next life; there will be rebirth; not a bit ethereal; not a bit illusory; 'the next life' and 'rebirth' are right above your head and mine, in the center; believe it! Think about it! Piously welcome the paradise of the next life, the eternal rebirth!"

The imaginative third beautiful soul finished describing the scenery of the fabricated next life and rebirth; it innocently enjoyed this illusion! It was simply drunk.

In this group of poetic souls and artistic souls, my soul felt a sense of sublimation and transcendence! My soul possessed them, and they also possessed my soul. In an instant, those walls, those moats, were all gone. I was glad to have overcome that ugly reality! So everyone laughed, everyone sang; everyone danced; everyone hugged; everyone kissed!

Suddenly, a hurricane and rainstorm came from afar, dispersing the illusion, shattering the dream! The beautiful souls scattered, leaving my soul staggering alone in a desolate wilderness; or like a remote mountain forest; at this time, the wind and rain stopped, and the bright moon rose high. But I heard the birds flying through the sky; and waves of warm floral fragrance! My soul lay quietly in the moonlight, with white clouds covering it. In this way, my soul was at peace! In this way, my soul leisurely returned to my body!

In a daze, I was pulled out of the realm of the soul by Chunshe. He gently awakened me, put a jujube-red morning coat on me, and then he walked out of my study with a kind smile.

A ray of dawn shone in through the window, the night was gone!

Christmas Eve of the 35th year in Ningbo Tower, Shanghai

### Ode to the Orchid

— Liu Shi

The orchid in the empty valley blooms and releases its fragrance on its own,

Although, it has endured wind and frost for a long time;

But—

It eternally reveals its fragrance to the universe.

Orchid!

Your life is as long as the sun and the moon.

The orchid in the empty valley is naturally pure and fragrant,

Although, it has been destroyed repeatedly;

But—

It still grows proudly on cliffs and high mountains.

Orchid!

Your life is the same as pine and cypress.

The orchid in the empty valley is self-respecting and self-valuing,

Although, the months and years have changed repeatedly,

But—

It never changes color, and never withers.

Orchid!

Your life is like Dong You, permanently glorious.

National orchid, two treasures!

You grow on steep ridges and high mountains,

Elegant people would never dare to risk their lives to pick you in groups,

Vulgar people also have no interest in appreciating you;

I am only a wild beast,

Lucky to be born with you in the same lonely valley;

I have neither the ambition to pick you in groups,

Nor the reason to appreciate you;

As long as the sky does not collapse, and the earth does not crack,

It is enough to live with you forever.

### Ode to Spring

— Botticelli

Botticelli (Sandro Botticelli 1448-1910)'s "Ode to Spring" is one of his representative works in his life. The picture is decorative, with beautiful and powerful lines. Composition, color, and theme all break the traditions of the Middle Ages, moving towards a new era of freedom and exuberance.

### Excerpts from Novel Anecdotes

— Tianxing

Yuxian Cave

"Yuxian Cave" is a novel completed in the early Tang Dynasty, rumored to be the work of Zhang Wencheng. Zhang Wencheng was a person during the time of Wu Zetian, named Zhuo, and Wencheng was his pseudonym. During his lifetime, his literary reputation was very high in the Tang Dynasty. Looking at the "Tang Book" which records: "When the envoys of Silla and Japan arrived, they must come up with gold to buy his articles," one can imagine. His works also include "Chao Ye Qian Zai", "Long Jin Feng Sui Pan", etc.

Speaking of "Yuxian Cave", it has long been lost in China, but it is very popular in Japan. It is said that in the Tang Dynasty, Japanese envoys came to our country and brought back this book, which greatly influenced Japanese literature. At first, China had this book, which Dong Kang obtained from the Tokyo Classical Preservation Society and reprinted it. Later, Zhang Chuandao published it with punctuation marks, and Lu Xun also wrote a preface for it. I was the editor-in-chief of "Chinese Strange Books Series" at the Qianqiu Publishing House, and I also included this book, printed into a small booklet, which was very popular at that time.

In the "Outline of Chinese Literature" written by Wen Gu Wen in Japan, there is such a record of "Yuxian Cave": "The 'Yuxian Cave' is the number one pornographic book in Japan, but it is lost in its home country. This book records that Zhang Wencheng was sent to Heyuan, and was fascinated by the cave of immortals, and was warmly entertained by the two fairy maidens, Shiniang and Wu Sao. The article is purely four-six parallel prose, extremely gorgeous and intricate. Stories are listed, sometimes interspersed with vulgar tunes. According to legend, during the reign of Emperor Saga, he summoned Confucian scholars to receive and transmit the 'Yuxian Cave', but none of the scholars passed it on. The scholar Yi Si deeply sighed. At that time, in the depths of the forest at the head of Kojima Shrine, there lived an old man in a thatched cottage, who often read something. When asked, he replied that he was reading 'Yuxian Cave'. When Yi Si heard this, he fasted for seven days, dressed neatly, led his attendants, and personally went to the old man's place to receive training and reading. After returning, he sent all kinds of treasures, but saw that the thatched cottage was gone, and there was no old man, only feeling a different fragrance. This is the incarnation of the great god of Honshima, recorded in the preface of the article Sheng Yingfang. Today, there are many books about 'Yuxian Cave' with training and lectures, and no romantic gentleman does not read 'Yuxian Cave', leaving many impressions on Japanese literature. It is said that Murasaki Shikibu's book 'The Tale of Genji' was also influenced by it."——(According to Junzuo's translation).

After reading the above mythological text, we can see the importance that the Japanese attach to the book "Yuxian Cave".

Water Margin Sequel

Shi Nai'an's "Water Margin" is quite popular, and Luo Guanzhong's "Conquest of the Four Bandits" is relatively inferior. Chen Chen, a remnant of the Ming Dynasty, used the pseudonym Yandang Shanqiao and wrote "After Water Margin" in forty chapters, detailing how Song Jun of the Mixed River became the King of Siam. Hu Shi said that it alluded to Zheng Chenggong's righteous uprising in Taiwan to avoid the literary inquisition at that time, which is quite reasonable. Chen was a native of Pingyang, Zhejiang. He was skilled in poetry throughout his life. I saw his poem about passing the Changsheng Pagoda with a certain monk in "Ou Xiaoji" (written by Wen Shang): "The pine trees in front of the temple gate move with sparse shadows, I want to look at the western suburbs when it snows, The old ministers who survived the perished country linger, How many people know about the indignation of the New Pavilion, The sorrow is so deep that I miscalculate three years of separation, The chaos is so extreme that I still talk about one day of poetry, Although Zhigong is beyond the realm of material things, He also lowers his eyebrows in the cold hall." The lament of the perished country is mournful and desperate!

The Peng Gong Case

The popular novel "The Peng Gong Case" has twenty-four volumes and one hundred chapters in the main collection, written by Qing Xuan Mengdao Ren, and published in the seventeenth year of Guangxu. The sequel was later added to seventeen collections, which were not written by the original author. "Hua Chao Sheng Notes" says: "The Peng Gong Case was published later, and its name is comparable to the Shi Gong Case, which is a derivative of Peng Gangzheng Gong Yu Case." In fact, the Peng Gong Case does not refer to Yu Case, but records the affairs of Peng Peng in the early Qing Dynasty. Li Yuandu's "National Biography of the Righteous Deeds" says: "Peng Peng, also known as Wuzhi, also known as Dayu, was a native of Putian, Fujian. In the Kangxi era, he was an official in Sanhe. He uncovered奸诈 and managed prisons like a god. There was someone who falsely claimed to be an edict and conveyed internal旨意 in the middle of the night. Peng Peng noticed the fraud, prolonged the talk, secretly sent someone to find out the 奸诈具， and found a奸诈状, and put him to death. It is quite similar to what is described in the Peng Gong Case", not about Yu Case. Peng later served as the Governor of Guangxi. Corrupt officials resigned at the sight of him. He was known for his integrity at the time. The original name of Tan Mengdao Ren was Yang Yidian, a native of Min, who had been in the幕府 for many years, and his footprints were all over the provinces in the north and south. He was also skilled in poetry throughout his life. I saw his poem about the Chengxiang Ancestral Hall in Chengdu in Li Kefeng's "Drunk Miscellaneous Notes": "The ancient ancestral hall of the Prime Minister, the pine and cypress are lush and deep, He planned the division of the three kingdoms, and wandered in the Liang Father's chant, The partial peace of the Han Dynasty in Mian, the loyal old minister exhausted his heart, The soil of the Central Plains was not replaced, the star grieved and sank in Wuzhang."

### An Inch of Mountain and River, An Inch of Blood 137

— Ye Jingfeng

However, if this plan to search for the "seven secret weapons" fails, and one or two of the "〇" roles are caught, how can Tsurumi always maintain his innocence without being implicated? This does not need to be too worried about; because the "〇" characters have never revealed traces of contact, nor have they shown any group performance; each person has a basis for appearing on the stage, each person has a very thick smoke screen, and each person also has his own bodyguard. For example, "〇 Twelve" is an active figure in the General Staff Headquarters, Yezhu is a senior field agent in the Telecommunications Section, and is temporarily assigned to Tsurumi as a service. As for Anzaka, although he is under police surveillance, he is actually being protected. In short, in this action, if any suspicious actions are found by Tsurumi's subordinates, no matter who it is, there is a layer of "protective color" to cover up, which will not only not implicate people, but even himself will not be implicated, so it will not affect Tsurumi even more.

Or someone may say, since Tsurumi's stakes in this decision to appear on the stage are so great, he can hide behind the scenes to direct, why must he risk this great danger and appear on the stage himself?

This is not the case; the secret work that Tsurumi is in charge of is not like the Yuanrong who commands the army, who can strategize in the tent, nor is it like the great thief and giant sly, who can stay out of the matter; especially this search, the nature of the "secret letter" is extremely complicated, and the work is extremely difficult. Although he has appointed Anzaka as the commander-in-chief, that is only a temporary nature with a time limit; Anzaka is not a leader after all; if problems beyond the scope of his authority occur, he will not be able to manage.

Moreover, the only secret to Tsurumi's leading position is to contact powerful people as much as possible and develop relationships in many aspects. The more complex the relationships, the better; he only needs to have a clear mind and know how to use the only weapon, the two words "insulation": when, where, in what kind of occasion, and to what kind of person or group, he should temporarily insulate and cut off the current of relationship. Just like this time, from about half past eight, the contact with his subordinates was completely cut off temporarily.

This arrangement seems extremely easy, but in this Tokyo city with layers of counter-espionage networks, this insulation method can absolutely protect one's innocence; because the relationship is completely cut off, not even a phone call is made, without revealing a trace of suspicion; but the following play, having lost all references, how can he sing it? Konoe is not an easy character to deal with? Needless to say, this play is very difficult to sing.

Tsurumi took the official document and drove straight to Beppu. On the way to his destination, he carefully looked at the streets on both sides. They were quiet and empty, and there was not even a shadow of a person in the middle of the road. Is it under martial law? But he did not see the guards, soldiers, etc. who were enforcing martial law.

When he arrived at the entrance of Beppu, he couldn't believe it, everything was still the same as when he came last time. There was only one post at the entrance, standing there, stiff and lifeless, like an Egyptian mummy. He passed this post lightly without any problems, so Tsurumi entered proudly. When he arrived at the reception room of this outer building, Tsurumi explained his intention to the person on duty, "I received an order from the Secretary's Office to bring a document to pay my respects to the Prime Minister." The person on duty made a phone call to the inside, and after waiting for two or three minutes, the reply from the inside was "Please come in."

### All Night

— Shaofu

On New Year's Eve, I slept all night; the next night, I was away from home again all night; three hundred and sixty-five days a year, it is rare to have such two good nights of sleep, although I am not used to it yet and have many nightmares, but it is always very comfortable.

After the dance halls were banned from operating all night, I wonder how many people arranged these two good nights. Speaking of the ban on dance halls operating all night, one cannot help but admire the determination of the public security authorities! We are outsiders and do not understand the truth, but judging from common sense, it is the recognition of such a trivial matter that the authorities do not know how much effort it takes?

I am a person who loves to dance. If the dance hall can dance all night, I may go to join in the fun; but considering the overall public security of the city, the economy of the citizens...etc., the ban is still a good thing. Mr. Xuan Tiewu

The joy of the leisure class is enough to stimulate the poor who have no money. Therefore, it is stipulated that all entertainment venues should close before midnight. It should be known that the night 搶劫 of bandits is much more profitable than夺门 and施劫. Therefore, the request of entertainment venues is tantamount to making some customers the target of bandits.

Everyone should admit this reason.

It is said that the China-US Friendship Association did not comply, and the police station has ordered it to close down.

Today, the market is already so depressed, in fact, why bother to happily suffer and have fun, and make the oil run out and the lamp wick burn out! From the perspective of relieving the economy, it is better for everyone to save two good points. When the economy is prosperous and the society is stable, everyone will have plenty of food and clothing. The dance halls will be open day and night, and no one will ban them.

### To the Future Nurses' Group

— 烔年

The general public calls "Nurses" "Caregivers," but this term is actually incorrect. Because "Caregiver" is a verb, not a noun. For example, a nanny taking care of a child is also a type of caregiving. Therefore, using "Caregiver" to refer to a nurse inevitably has a somewhat dismissive implication, and nurses do not welcome this title.

The job of "Nurse" has become the most ideal specialized profession for women. The reasons are nothing more than that women have gentle personalities, are careful in everything, and most women generally have more compassion than men, therefore they are suitable for taking care of patients.

Becoming a nurse is a very difficult task. They must graduate from junior high school and be admitted to a nursing school, where they undergo three years of rigorous training before they can graduate and become official nurses. At this time, they usually still need to work for one to two years at the hospital designated by their original school before they can freely seek employment. During the training period, in addition to studying, they also need to work practically in the hospital, first as assistants to the nurses. The courses they take, in addition to the "Nursing" part, include the same "Medical" training as doctors. However, the books they use are simpler Chinese translations. Due to the difficulty of the coursework, students often drop out midway. Therefore, a class often starts with twenty or thirty students, but by the time of graduation, there are fewer than ten people left. Of course, many nursing schools with simple facilities and lax education will have lower coursework standards. Therefore, when hospitals hire nurses, they pay considerable attention to the schools they graduated from. Currently in Shanghai, graduates from "Peking Union Medical College", "Hunan-Yale (Xiangya)", "Tongji", "Shanghai" are more sought after.

Day and Night

In a society where professional women are often seen as "ornamental," nurses are the only ones who can be considered to rely entirely on "real talent and practical skills." Their daily working hours are mostly a full eight hours, which is longer than the office hours of general agencies. At the same time, their work does not distinguish between day and night. Normally, a day is divided into three shifts: from 7:00 AM to 3:00 PM for the early shift, from 3:00 PM to 11:00 PM for the middle shift, and from 11:00 PM to 7:00 AM the next morning for the night shift. There is often only one or two nurses on duty, taking turns, while there are at least twenty or more patients being cared for. Therefore, during working hours, they cannot be lazy in the slightest. The malady of "arriving late and leaving early" is impossible for them to do because, during their shift, the safety of these twenty-odd patients is entirely their responsibility.

Nurses have a strict organization—the Chinese Nurses Association—which has established various rules for everyone to follow. If there is a violation of the rules, the "Nurses Association" has the right to permanently revoke her qualification.

In the hospital, we can see many young women wearing white uniforms. However, they are not necessarily all nurses, maybe they are assistants of nurses—assistant staff. The way to distinguish them is by the distinctive hat made of a folded white cloth. This hat, held in place with two safety pins at the edge of the fluffy hairline, cannot shield from rain or wind, but its value is equivalent to a doctoral hat! Only official nurses can wear it, and assistants often cast envious and jealous glances. In military hospitals, the nurses' hats are trimmed with different colors to distinguish the levels of rank. As for the nurses' ranks, they are usually Head Nurse, Supervisor, Nurse Manager, Assistant Nurse Manager, First-Class Nurse, Second-Class Nurse, etc. Their promotion mainly depends on the number of years since graduation and the length of service. Of course, in China, where the personnel system prevails, there are inevitably many who rely on their connections and background to become Head Nurses or Nurse Managers. Regarding the issue of affiliations, it is currently causing a lot of trouble in the medical field. In all larger hospitals, from the院长 (Hospital Director) onwards, doctors or nurses in higher positions almost all belong to one affiliation—the school they graduated from. Therefore, if talent from another affiliation tries to join, not only is it not easy to get in, but those who are already serving are often squeezed out. It is hoped that the "Nurses Association" can have a good solution to this problem.

In hospitals, one can often see some patients who doubt the service methods of the nurses. Sometimes they feel that the nurses take better care of others than themselves, so they sometimes slander them, leaving the nurses not knowing whether to laugh or cry. In fact, nurses, of course, make necessary distinctions based on the severity of the patients' conditions when working. There are also some patients who do not understand medicine well and often criticize the work of the nurses with short-sightedness, and even question them. The poor young ladies, in the situation of "a scholar meeting a soldier," the only way is to cry to vent the grievances in their hearts.

Angels in White

After a patient enters the hospital and the doctor diagnoses the condition, except for important injections and surgeries, almost all the work is done by the nurses. They receive prescriptions from the doctor and give the patient medicine on time, measure body temperature, count pulse, do hot compresses, cold compresses... various different procedures, and record the patient's daily progress for the doctor's reference. In addition, they also need to be responsible for managing the cleanliness of the ward and the comfort of the patients. When a patient groans in pain, they must carefully ask in detail. Therefore, some people call nurses "Angels in White."

The nursing profession is great and arduous. Therefore, many nurses often leave their posts after marriage. Of course, many of them do so because of the initiative of their husbands, because they see their wives working hard and bitterly, and the meager salary of only two or thirty million yuan per month, who would want them to continue? Many hospitals stipulate that only unmarried women can be nurses.

Currently, there is an extreme shortage of nursing talent. Because of the difficulty of training them, the writer suggests that every nurse, whether married or not, should serve in society for at least five years after graduation, so as not to let down the difficulty of training and to fulfill the responsibility of an angel and benefit mankind!

### Lincoln's Doctor's Dog

— Translated by 景正 from Coronet

In America, according to research, books with the words "Lincoln," "Doctor," or "Dog" in the title are easier to sell. Someone wrote a book titled "Lincoln's Doctor's Dog," but it didn't sell.

Recently, the various American goods stores are no longer as popular as they used to be, and business is getting worse every day. The various stores plan to sell off. At the beginning when renting counters, they paid a tip of 500,000 to 1,000,000 yuan or so. Today, seeing that the tips cannot be recovered, it is really wanting to make a foreign fortune, but instead, the foreign fortune has been made off with!

### A Timely Transaction: Selling Spring Couplets

— 蕭亢石

According to Chinese customs, on the first day of the lunar new year, every family pastes a pair of "spring couplets" on the front door. Spring couplets are derived from "peach wood boards." Song Dynasty's Zhao Gengfu's New Year's Eve poem says: "The verses on the peach wood charms are good, fearing to disturb passers-by."

The beginning of spring couplets was when the Ming Taizu was in Jinling. On New Year's Eve, an imperial decree was suddenly issued that officials and commoners must add a pair of spring couplets to their doors. Therefore, at this time, every family pasted a red spring couplet on the door on New Year's Day. This custom has continued unabated, so it created the prank of Zhu Zhishan writing spring couplets, which has been passed down as a joke.

At the end of the lunar year, fortune tellers on the streets of Shanghai hang red spring couplets everywhere, and business is booming. It is also a happy income once a year. However, most of the verses of these spring couplets are extremely vulgar and not worth mentioning.

In recent years, there have also been down-on-their-luck literati who write many spring couplets at the end of the year and distribute them to each household on every street, and after one or two days, collect "brush money" from the shops, but there are very few buyers.

In the past few days, another ×× Literary Society has been found sending out spring couplets in separate groups, with addresses and telephone numbers, but whether they are genuine is unknown. The spring couplets they write, of course, cannot avoid a kind of extremely vulgar auspicious language, embedding the name of each shop in the upper position of each line of the couplet. After two or three days, two people in suits come to collect money with two briefcases. The price is printed on the spring couplet, which is 1,000 legal currency. If the shop doesn't buy it, they are also very forthright and don't take it back, putting on a very distressed expression, because the couplet embeds the shop's name, so it cannot be sold to others. However, this kind of sacrifice, they also have a "calculation". If three out of ten families buy their spring couplets, given the vastness of Shanghai's streets and the number of shops, even if they distribute 10,000 spring couplets and sell only two or three thousand, their income will of course be two or three million yuan. Having this income in this short period of the New Year, why not do it? Here, it can be seen that Shanghai is so big, nothing is impossible, as long as you can "use your brain". A small 1,000 yuan for a spring couplet, but knowing that the area is vast and there are so many shops, little things add up to a lot. Their "selling spring couplets" business is a timely good deal! This shows that Shanghai is not poor, and there is gold everywhere, it just depends on whether you have a "gimmick".

### Weekend

The National Assembly authorities invited Mei Lanfang's troupe to perform in Beijing. The Mei troupe rushed to Beijing on the 24th, and performed in Beijing for a total of three days. The last performance was held in the Cultural Auditorium, and President Chiang and his wife also attended the performance.

President Chiang summoned Mei Lanfang during this performance in Beijing, and also presented him with an inscription as a gift, which is truly the supreme honor for Mei.

During the three days Mei spent in Beijing, he performed the play Yu Bei Ting (御碑亭). Renowned amateur actor Zhao Peixin and all the members of the Mei troupe provided support. The play Yu Bei Ting depicts a woman maintaining her purity on a stormy night, with profound meaning. Before Mei's headline performance, there were also Lin Shusen's Guan Gong play and Li Danlin and Wang Yinqiu's Fanjiang Pass, etc.

Mei stayed at the home of National Assembly Secretary-General Hong Lanyou in Beijing, and was treated warmly. Many people in the Mei troupe had never been to Beijing before. Unfortunately, the weather was not good, and it rained for several days, so they were unable to visit scenic spots.

The President originally planned to keep Mei in Beijing for the New Year and invited Marshal Ma to see Mei's opera. Due to contractual obligations in Shanghai, he had to politely decline and rush back. The last performance at the China Grand Theater is scheduled for the 6th, with no extensions. There are still several charity performances starting from the 7th, which are expected to end around the 12th or 13th.

Starting today, are the last three days of Mei's performance this time, Mei's representative famous play "Life and Death Grievances" will be performed as a farewell.

Film: Since the victory, good naval warfare films have been scarce in the past year. Robert Taylor served in the Navy and filmed "Stand By For Action", which described the American and Japanese naval battle on the Pacific Ocean with a fictional story. There are many intense fleet gun battle scenes in the film. Charles Laughton is relegated to a supporting role, but his performance is still not bad.

If I had to choose the best movie of the week, I would definitely pick Bing Crosby's "Going My Way." Although the religious atmosphere in the film is strong (to the point of making people cry), it is not dull. Bing Crosby's bass singing is, of course, beyond words.

Conversely, the supposedly extremely stimulating and vivid "Dive Bomber" appears dull and ordinary. The story introduces the process of a U.S. Navy aviation medical officer studying high-altitude illnesses in pilots and inventing treatment methods. Apart from the colors and the boasting about the aircraft, there is nothing to gain.

Deanna Durbin is very sweet in her first color film, "Can't Help Singing". As for the plot, it is just cobbled together and not very good.

Finally, "Fantasia" should be mentioned. Disney was able to conceptualize musical art into cartoon images, expressing it concretely and rhythmically, which has to be said to be a bold attempt. The film has a total of eight musical masterpieces. My favorite is Tchaikovsky's Nutcracker and Beethoven's Pastoral Symphony. The last song, "Night on Bald Mountain," ends with Schubert's "Ave Maria," powerfully contrasting the passing of sin with the hope of new life.

Music: Recently, there has been a major event in the Shanghai music scene: the Shanghai Beethoven Society has published a book, "The Liberator of Sound, Beethoven." This is the most detailed and accurate biography of Beethoven ever, the product of thirty years of painstaking work by the modern Beethoven research expert R.H. Schauffler, containing hundreds of thousands of words, including major and minor events in Beethoven's life and valuable photographs. This book has been translated by Ms. Peng Yalu and is about to be released. At this time and place, someone is willing to do this arduous and thankless work, which makes people feel fortunate for music and culture! Saying it is a major event is by no means intentional propaganda!

Last Sunday (December 29), the Municipal Symphony Orchestra was supposed to have a wonderful performance. The conductor of the orchestra, Mrs. Margolinsky, was the soprano soloist, and the program included famous selections from operas, but there was a last-minute change, and the performance was suddenly announced to be rescheduled to the 4th and 5th. It is thought to be related to the "year-end salary" issue of the Municipal Orchestra. The life of musicians is poor, which is truly a loss for art!

The "Chinese Wind Orchestra" of the Zhongle Music Hall performed once at the Zhendan Auditorium last December. The methods and approaches have indeed been modernized as much as possible, but the number of people is too small, and the momentum is not very impressive! The crux of the problem of reforming Chinese music lies in: even when reformed to the extreme, it is still 108,000 miles away from modern progressive music! This is the truth, not "inferiority complex"!
