### Great Victory of the National Army in Jiaodong on Two Fronts: Longkou and Qixia Completely Recovered; Communist Bandits in Luxi's Kecheng and Wucheng Fled Across the Longhai Railway

[Report from this newspaper, 27th day of the month] Jiaodong

The National Army achieved a great victory on two fronts. One route, advancing north from Zhaoyuan,

formally recovered Laizhou's important port of Longkou at 4:30 PM on the 26th, and is now

turning its sails eastward to join forces with a unit advancing north from Zhaoguzhuang and Fengyidian to attack Huangxian. Another route, advancing north from

Laiyang, after breaking through the strong resistance of the communist bandits,

also formally recovered Qixia City at 2:30 PM on the 26th. The bandits suffered over 5,000 casualties, leaving over 800 corpses behind. Currently, the focus of the Jiaodong war is entirely on

Juchiya, about 20 kilometers south of Yao Louxia,

This mountain is the last and largest

base of the communist bandits on the Shandong Peninsula. After the communist bandits in this area are eliminated,

Yantai's bandits will be defeated without a fight.

[Report from this newspaper, Jinan, 27th day of the month] Most of the communist army in southwestern Luxi

retreated south to Caoxian.

The National Army captured Chengwu this morning.

[Report from this newspaper, Yanzhou, 27th day of the month] The focus of the war in southwestern Luxi is gradually shifting south again. Chen Yi and

the remnants of his forces, claiming to be three columns, took advantage of gaps between Cao and

Shan counties to flee south again. One unit

has already fled to the area east and west of Wutun and Liukou, north of the Longhai Line on the border of Lu and Yu. The National Army is

dividing its forces to encircle and suppress them.

[Report from this newspaper, Kaifeng, 27th day of the month] Military news: Chen Yi's 11th and 12th Columns, except for ten thousand men,

after fleeing south across the Longhai Railway yesterday from the areas of Ye,

Neihuang's Lu and Dangshan, advanced southward through Ningling and Suixian in a very flustered manner. Their vanguard arrived this afternoon in the area of Shiyuan, about ten miles north of Qixian,

and joined forces with Jin Shaoshan's and Wei Fenglou's units, showing signs of fleeing into southern Henan via Shenqiu and Zicheng.

[Report from this newspaper, Xuzhou, 27th day of the month] The scattered bandits in the area north of Cheng, on the southern bank of the Yellow River in Luxi, have now been completely eliminated. All ferry crossings on the southern bank of the Yellow River are now

garrisoned by the National Army. The connection between the northern bank and the bandits in southwestern Luxi has been completely severed. (War news from the Northeast, Hebei, Henan, Anhui, and Hubei provinces can be found on the second page.)

### Zhang Qun Leaves Beiping in the Rain to Personally Inspect Tanggu New Port; He Will Go to Jinan on His Return to Beijing

[Report from this newspaper, Beiping, 27th day of the month] Zhang Qun

left Beiping by special train for Tianjin at 9:00 AM on the 27th, in the rain.

Xing Jiangxin, Director of the Tanggu New Port Engineering Bureau, Tan Bingxun, Director of the Beiping Public Works Bureau, and Sun Yueqi accompanied him.

Li Zongren, Sun Yunzhong, He Siyuan, and other officials, all went to the station to see him off. Before Zhang left Beiping,

he answered inquiries from Chinese and foreign reporters as follows:

Question: Regarding Dr. Sun Ke's statement and the reaction from

the United States, what are the Premier's thoughts?

Also, Dr. Sun Ke recently stated in an interview with the United Press that China's foreign policy may

change. Does this represent the views of the Chinese government, or is it entirely his personal opinion?

Answer: Regarding our country's foreign policy, I

addressed this matter at a welcoming party at Yenching University.

That can serve as my answer to this question.

Question: What is the military and political situation in the Northeast?

Answer: I firmly believe that under Chief Commander Chen's leadership,

the military and political situation in the Northeast will soon improve.

Question: What is the Premier's opinion on the appointment of Soong Tzu-wen to preside over Guangdong,

and what are your thoughts on the reaction from the news media?

Answer: Appointing Soong Tzu-wen to preside over Guangdong is a case of having a Cantonese manage

Guangdong. Moreover, given his steadfast and responsible work ethic,

he will undoubtedly make many contributions to the province's administration. As for whether the news media's praise

or criticism is accurate, the facts will eventually prove this.

I do not intend to make any criticisms at this time.

Question: Is it rare for a Premier of the Executive Yuan to serve as a provincial

chairman? What are the inside reasons for former Premier Soong's appointment as chairman of Guangdong?

Answer: If you asked Mr. Soong to be the chairman of another province,

even if Soong had never served as Premier of the Executive Yuan, he might not have agreed. If the difficult situation in Guangdong Province was not as dire as it is after today's massive flood,

Mr. Soong would probably also have hesitated.

[Report from this newspaper, Tianjin, 27th day of the month] Premier Zhang Qun

arrived in Tanggu on the morning of the 27th to inspect the new port.

Reporters accompanied him. When he arrived in Tanggu in the afternoon, Zhang

got out of the car in the rain to review the honor guard. Xing Qixin, Director of the Tanggu New Port Engineering Bureau,

Du Jianshi, Mayor of Tianjin, and others accompanied him on an inspection of the new port. Sun Yueqi,

Shi Zhiren, and Zhang's entourage also went along. He first

inspected the second wharf of the new port, looked out at the breakwater,

and then went to the first wharf to inspect the three warehouses under construction. He continued to the ship lock for inspection. Zhang asked

Director Xing in great detail, appearing very pleased. He then

summoned all the employees for a speech, stating roughly: The Tanggu New

Port is related to the prosperity of the entire north, and the government attaches great importance to it. Two thousand years ago, Li Bing of Tai'an, Guanxian, Sichuan,

built the Dujiangyan Irrigation System, which could irrigate 3 million mu of farmland each year. To this day, the people of Sichuan still worship him

and repay his virtue. However, this largest water conservancy project in Sichuan Province

is still insignificant compared to the new port project. Currently, the country's expenditure is huge, and finances are

very difficult. I sincerely hope that all employees will work hard

on national construction. Zhang and others left Tanggu at 4:00 PM,

arriving in Tianjin at 5:30 PM. Zhang Boling, head of the local gentry from various circles,

and several hundred others welcomed him. After Zhang got out of the car,

he immediately visited Zhang Boling. At 7:00 PM, he attended a joint conference of the Tianjin Party, government, military, and civic groups,

followed by a joint public banquet hosted by various circles in Tianjin.

### Total Bank Deposits in the Country Exceed Two Trillion

The government is seeking to absorb floating capital

[Report from this newspaper, Tianjin, 27th day of the month] Premier Zhang

met with reporters in the car on his return from Tanggu to Tianjin

and answered questions. Regarding the recent trouble caused by floating capital,

manipulating prices, he said it was indeed an important

issue, giving the example that the total deposits of more than two hundred

banks across the country were only over two trillion.

The government is constantly seeking to absorb floating capital.

Regarding the government's emphasis on North China, Zhang

said: The government has placed the best quality and

largest number of troops in North China. In terms of economics,

most of the resources of the National Resources Commission are allocated to North China.

The best engineering talent is also mostly in the north.

Therefore, in terms of military affairs, politics, and personnel, there is sufficient

evidence to show the central government's emphasis on the north. Regarding rumors

of currency reform, he said that experts and scholars

were all conducting research and contributing opinions from time to time. The government is also paying close attention, but the current conditions are not yet

met. The government has not yet decided on a method, and it is impossible to say when it

can be implemented. Regarding supporting export

trade, Zhang said that the Joint Four Offices were unable to decide.

### Investigation of Foreign Exchange Usage: Four Supervisory Committee Members Carefully Draft Reports; Emphasis on Stockpiled Goods at Shanghai Wharf

[Report from this newspaper, Nanjing, 27th day of the month] The "Report on the Investigation of Foreign Exchange Usage," which is highly valued by all parties,

is being drafted by Supervisors Wang Guanwu and He Hanwen. Wang and others are

being very careful with this investigation. After returning to Beijing, they discovered that some materials still needed to be supplemented. The Commission will send

an auditor to Shanghai again to collect information. The completion of the entire report will probably

still take time. Also, the most important thing that Wang and others are focusing on in this investigation is the goods purchased

with foreign exchange prepared by stockpilers at the wharf.

The Executive Yuan's emphasis on this matter is due to the evidence cited by their investigation. A member of

the Supervisory Committee participating in this investigation said: Some of the goods stockpiled at the wharf are products and

raw materials. These types of goods should be allowed to enter, but this should not be taken as a precedent. As for large

automobiles, if

their price exceeds the government-stipulated $1,200, they should not be allowed to enter.

However, it is also impossible to force them to be shipped back to their original exporting locations in Europe and the United States. The only

possibility is to smuggle them in through Hong Kong for sale at high prices. Rather than that, it would be better to find another

appropriate countermeasure, allow them to enter, and impose restrictions.

It has been decided to tighten loans, but it has been decided to

strongly support export trade. After the foreign exchange control measures were improved,

exports have already increased dramatically. When a reporter asked about the UNRRA suspending the shipment of relief supplies to North China, Zhang said

that the government had already decided on a method and was currently negotiating.

[Report from this newspaper, Zhangjiakou, 26th day of the month] Premier Zhang,

due to his urgent need to return to Beijing to preside over the Executive Yuan meeting next Tuesday,

shortened his original itinerary. He will go to Tianjin on the 27th to

inspect the new port project and then conclude his trip to the north. On his return to Beijing,

he will go to Jinan to comfort the military and civilians of the war-torn city of Shandong and visit the newly recovered areas to

plan reconstruction and relief. His trip to Taiyuan has been

canceled, and a telegram has been sent to Yan Xishan, stating that he will visit Taiyuan when he inspects

the Northwest.

### Leaves a Deep Impression in Six Hours in Zhangyuan

[Report from this newspaper, Zhangjiakou, 26th day of the month] Premier Zhang Qun

flew to Zhangjiakou by special plane at 10:00 AM on the 26th, accompanied by his staff.

Mayor He Siyuan of Beiping came along. Fu Zuoyi

led the Suiyuan Pacification Headquarters and the heads of the provincial government to greet him at the airport. Zhang got off the plane amidst military music and reviewed the honor guard. Shan Chuanbian and Ren accompanied him into the city,

touring around. The people came to welcome him with cheers. At noon, he attended a welcome

rally of people from all walks of life and delivered a speech, first saying: The more I go to the border areas, the more I feel that my compatriots are respectable and lovable.

The spirit of vigor and vitality shown by the military and civilians of Zhangjiakou symbolizes a bright future for the country. Zhang praised General

Fu as the Great Wall of the North and felt deeply that Fu's method of governing the army and winning over the people was very effective, especially his sharing weal and woe with the soldiers,

getting close to the people, and being familiar with the sufferings of the people. The impression was very deep. Zhangjiakou has been recovered for less than a year, and

he was very impressed that all aspects could have such achievements. He also encouraged the military and civilians to make Zhangjiakou the great gate of northern national defense,

which the central government has always attached importance to, and should, under the leadership of Director Fu, concentrate their will, contribute to the country,

and complete the task of suppressing the rebellion and building the nation. Zhang was in good spirits, and his words were very sincere, which drew thunderous applause. Zhang

then met with reporters in a "dragon gate formation" style.

When answering questions about the different feelings from Nanjing to the north, he said: In North China and the Northeast, there are both foreign and domestic troubles, and the suffering of the people in deep water and hot fire is the deepest. The central government has always been concerned. The economic life in the north is difficult, and political facilities are simple, but the enthusiastic emotions shown by the people are all the more cherished.

The north is rich in resources and has a considerable scale of industry, which can be used as a base for national economic construction.

At present, attention should be paid to grasping the hearts of the people. Building the nation must first build the people. Only when the problem of building the people is solved can other construction be carried out. Comparing Beiping and Shanghai, he said:

Shanghai is China's largest metropolis, and its people are extravagant. Beiping is an ancient city with a history of five thousand years, and

its people are dispirited and in great need of changing their atmosphere. Regarding the issue of Mongolian banner autonomy, he expressed that promoting local autonomy

is the government's established policy. The Mongolian people have their own special

habits and traditions of political system. When formulating the autonomy law, attention should be paid to taking them into account. The implementation of autonomy should be prepared and have steps, and should not be hasty.

At present, the bandit troubles have not been quelled, and from the Northeast to the Northwest, everything is not stable. Under the goal of military first and safety first,

we should unite and work hard together to overcome the difficulties of the times, and in the spirit of Mongolian-Han cooperation, follow the procedures prescribed by the constitution

and gradually support Mongolian banner self-determination.

Regarding rectifying officialdom and eliminating corruption, he believed that it is necessary to rectify the root cause, improve treatment, and stabilize life. Various methods and organizations

should prevent opportunities for corruption. In addition to adopting stopgap measures such as reviewing and severely punishing, the government should also pay attention to the implementation of improving the lives of civil servants,

carefully selecting officials, strictly assessing rewards and punishments, and legally guaranteeing them, and hope to improve the public's spirit of law-abiding and shift the atmosphere so that

everyone understands and worships the law, so that corruption can be eradicated.

He finally said that he was very concerned about the frontier news industry and that the central government would provide effective support.

Although Zhang's visit lasted only a few hours, he was still able to chat with reporters for forty minutes, looking very happy. Zhang's visit, although only six

hours long, left a deep impression on the military and civilians, because Zhang was the first prominent politician to visit Zhangjiakou, and the military and civilians were filled with enthusiasm,

fully demonstrating the border people's sincere support for the government.

### Frequent Military Transport in the Southern Border of Outer Mongolia

[Report from this newspaper, Gui Sui, 27th day of the month] Recently,

military transport has been frequent in the southern border of Outer Mongolia. On the afternoon of the 22nd, ten trucks loaded with lumber

and horse grass were heading from Kulun to Zadagai Tuza. It seems they are building barracks there.

### Three Sets of Powerful Runway Lights to Be Shipped from the US to Shanghai Soon; Will Be Installed at Airports in Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Wuhan

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 27th day of the month] According to a spokesman for the Civil Aviation Administration,

three sets of powerful runway lights ordered from the United States will soon be shipped to Shanghai. These runway lights have been

widely used by the U.S. military since 1943. They can emit a very high luminous flux and can help aircraft take off and land safely

at night or during the day when "visibility" is poor. It is said that the three sets of equipment will be installed in

Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Wuhan as soon as they arrive. Once the equipment is completed,

domestic flight safety will be more effectively guaranteed.

### Ban Commercial Dance Halls

Political Committee unanimously agrees to implement government orders

[Report from this newspaper, Nanjing, 27th day of the month] The issue of banning commercial dance halls

was brought up for discussion at the Provisional Political Affairs Conference on the morning of the 27th. The Political Committee unanimously

agreed that government orders must be implemented and instructed the Shanghai

Municipal Government to handle the matter effectively.

### Extension of National Assembly Delegate Voting Period for the Election of the President and Vice President to Be Ratified; Election Procedures Also Revised

[Report from this newspaper, Nanjing, 27th day of the month] The Election Steering Committee

held its eleventh meeting on the 27th. Chairman Zhang Lisheng first reported on the process of extending the voting

period for National Assembly delegates by one month and

requested ratification. He stated: [The important progress of the election of National Assembly delegates is based on reports from all parties.

The election offices in all provinces and cities are working hard to ensure that

they can be realized as scheduled. However, the reality shows that there is no way to proceed in parallel as scheduled.

In order to quickly come up with a remedy, there is ultimately no way to have both law and reality.

The only thing to do is to appropriately extend the originally scheduled voting dates for National Assembly delegates to November 21 to 23,

which is actually an extension of one month. Although it does not

conform to the regulations on the implementation preparation procedures,

it is even more serious in showing the solemnity of the National Assembly elections.

The above opinions were submitted to the National Government for approval at the State Council meeting this week in order to adapt to the situation and catch up

with the process. It has already been submitted to the National Government for a resolution by the State Council and requested ratification. It will be approved immediately.

The request for ratification was approved. At the meeting, the candidates for committee members of the district and county election offices in Hebei, Hubei, Guangdong, Guizhou, Ningxia, Border Region, Anhui, Fujian,

Guangxi and other regions were also approved.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 7th day of the month] After the State Council

officially decided yesterday to postpone the voting date for the election of National Assembly delegates by one month,

the Election Steering Office opened its eleventh election committee meeting today.

The procedures for carrying out the election of National Assembly delegates have also been revised.

604 copies.

[Another telegram] The Wuxian Press Association has submitted a report to the county

election office with the names of its members. There are a total of 604 members, most of whom are strangers.

Correspondents and reporters stationed in Suzhou from other places account for only a little less than one-tenth.

### Shanghai Labor Groups Prepare to Welcome British Delegation to China

[Report from this newspaper] The British Parliamentary Delegation to China

[British Information Office, London, 27th day of the month]

The British Parliamentary Delegation to China is currently busy with various banquets before their departure. All members of the delegation are in frequent contact with people from all walks of life in China and the UK.

### French Navy Withdraws from South Sand Island in the Xisha Islands

[United Press, Guangzhou, 27th day of the month] According to naval circles,

the French Navy has withdrawn from Coral Island, about 70 miles west of the Xisha Islands.

### Wife of U.S. Consul General Talks About the Recent Situation in Dalian

[United Press, Seoul, 27th day of the month] The wife of

the U.S. Consul General to Dalian, Mr. Pennington Goff, recently flew to Pyongyang on a Soviet military plane due to illness,

and then arrived in Seoul by train. She declared here today that Dalian is under the supervision of the Lu army and

is now managed by Chinese people who can speak Japanese. The important positions in the city

government are all filled by pro-Soviet people, but it has not been stated whether these Chinese people are communists.

The total population of Dalian is more than one million, and about 250,000 overseas Chinese have been sent back to their country.

Most of the Chinese people have also moved to areas controlled by the Chinese government, and the current number is far less than that.

The port is used exclusively by Soviet ships, with two to seven docking per week,

apparently traveling to Lushun or Vladivostok. Traffic on the Dalian-Shenyang railway has long been cut off,

and trains only run between Lushun and the Soviet military headquarters. American citizens are allowed to move freely in the city and

can purchase food, but local prices are very expensive due to inflation.

Communications between the U.S. consulates in Dalian and Vladivostok are also delayed by the Soviet military from time to time.

### Marshal Ma's Special Plane While Staying in China Purchased by China National Aviation Corporation for Commercial Use

[United Press, Nanjing, 27th day of the month]

and re-launched for commercial aviation use.

### Postal, Telecommunications, Railway, and Military Price Increase Plan; Ministry of Transportation Submits Four Principles to the Executive Yuan to Adjust Prices by District Based on Local Index Scores

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 27th day of the month] The method of increasing the prices of public utilities such as postal, telecommunications, railway, and military services; according to

the plan submitted by the Ministry of Transportation to the Executive Yuan's provisional meeting on the 27th, the following four principles are proposed:

1. Price increases by district, adjusting the prices according to the different cost of living indices in various regions of the country.

2. Adjust prices according to costs. Currently, postal and telecommunications services are operating at a huge loss. If prices are increased according to costs, then

the postage for a regular letter must be increased to 2,500 yuan, and the price of telegrams and telephones must be doubled in order to balance revenue and expenditure.

3. Take into account the burden on the people and make appropriate adjustments. The shortfall will still be subsidized by the government.

4. Maintain the old price and continue to be subsidized by the government. After deliberation, the decision was paid and submitted for discussion at the next meeting.

### Prohibition of Sales of Foreign Luxury Goods: Regulations to be Examined by Executive Yuan
[Report from our Nanjing office, 27th] According to the provisions of the Outline of Measures for Implementing Thrift and Economy in Consumption, any goods prohibited from import will be confiscated by the government if found on the market two months after the promulgation of the outline. Based on this, the Ministry of Economic Affairs has drafted "Measures for Combating the Sale of Prohibited Imported Goods," which were submitted to the Executive Yuan and, after discussion at the temporary Executive Yuan meeting on the 27th, were decided to be submitted for review. It is understood that: The prohibited imported goods referred to in the measures include foreign wines, foreign cigarettes, complete manicure sets, parts, powder compacts, dressing cases, perfumes, cosmetics, pure silk or rayon knitted threads and ribbons, pure silk or mixed thread cut velvet, and other various luxury goods, but goods with the same name are not included in the crackdown. These prohibited items are divided into two categories: A and B. Category A will be prohibited from sale nationwide simultaneously starting from New Year's Day of the 37th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1948], and Category B will be prohibited by government order at an appropriate time. These items will be confiscated and sealed by the relevant agencies. After the period for appealing the penalty expires, they will be sold off on a fixed schedule. Thirty percent of the proceeds will be used as rewards for those who report the smuggling and the officers who seize the goods. The remaining proceeds will be used for refugee relief. The identification of prohibited imported goods will be the responsibility of a Prohibited Imported Goods Identification Committee, convened by the competent authorities and composed of representatives from local chambers of commerce, trade associations, and relevant industry guilds.

[Report from our Nanjing office, 27th] Article 9 of the Measures for Import and Export Trade stipulates that importers shall not engage in procedures to pre-order goods from abroad without obtaining a permit. It has now been decided to amend this to read: "Importers shall not enter into contracts to purchase goods from abroad or ship goods from abroad before obtaining an import permit." This has been passed by the temporary meeting of the Executive Yuan on the 27th and will be promulgated and implemented. The original regulations were difficult to implement in view of the actual situation of import businesses. The current method of issuing import permits requires merchants to provide documentation of the goods they intend to purchase, otherwise the nature and price of the goods cannot be determined, and the reasonableness of the import application cannot be reviewed. For bulk commodities traded on a forward basis, such as cotton, it has become a commercial practice for merchants to order futures, and there is no need or necessity to prevent this. For bulk commodities supplied on a long-term basis, such as diesel, gasoline, and kerosene, shipping plans must be determined several months before shipment. If advance consultation and ordering and transportation procedures are not allowed, the sale of these essential materials may come to a standstill. For these reasons, the amendment was made.

[Report from the Central News Agency, Nanjing, 27th] The Executive Yuan held its second temporary meeting at 9:00 a.m. on the 27th, chaired by the Deputy President. Resolutions on various cases were selected for publication as follows: The case of the division of management agencies and authority over state-owned land was passed according to the principles of the review amendment. The Electricity Law was amended and passed. The Commercial Registration Law was passed in principle and submitted to the Ministry of Economic Affairs for public consultation and then submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval. The amendment to the Publication Law was "submitted for review." The amendment to the National Newspaper Law and the Public Notice Regulations was amended and passed. The amendment to the Provincial Bank Regulations was amended and passed. The Measures for Implementing Thrift and Economy were amended and passed. The amendment to Article 9 of the Measures for Import and Export Trade was passed.

### Zhang Yanting is Resting in Peace; Li Tingyu Accuses Zhang of Receiving Bribes; Military and Official Supervisory Group Will Investigate
[Report from our Beiping office, 27th] Former Tianjin Mayor Zhang Yanting has been accused by Li Tingyu, Chairman of the Tianjin Self-Government Promotion Association, of receiving bribes. A spokesperson for the Military and Official Supervisory Group announced today that the group received Li's letter of accusation in early September but has not yet investigated. The investigation conducted by Zhou Zishi in Tianjin was for time-sensitive cases, and the group was unable to formally commence work in Tianjin due to the lack of funds. It will investigate later. The spokesperson also confirmed that shortly after Zhang Yanting took office, Li accused him before Chairman Chiang. The Chairman ordered Li Zongren to investigate. Director Li declined because the matter concerned supervision and requested Li Sichong to handle it. Inspector Li went to Tianjin to meet with Li Tingyu and conducted extensive investigations but found no evidence. This time, Li filed the accusation in his own name but still failed to provide conclusive evidence. Zhang Yanting is now resting and recuperating in Beiping and has issued a statement in the newspaper, stating that he has requested the Supervisory Group to conduct a thorough investigation and that the plaintiff should provide evidence. According to Li Tingyu's statement, if the accusation is false, he is willing to accept the consequences. He also stated that he met with Zhang, Lu Zhonglin, and others regarding this matter.

### Yuning Claims to Have Recaptured Luoning; No Trace of Bandits in the Southeast Area of Tongguan; The Focus of the War Between Yu and E Shifts North
[Report from the Joint News Agency, Nanjing, 27th] A telegram from Kaifeng today stated: The National Army has achieved a great victory in western Henan. As a result of fierce attacks by the army and air force, Luoning, an important city 55 li southwest of Luoyang, was recaptured, and more than 1,000 bandits were killed. Another route advanced eastward along the Haizhou Railway from Tongguan and recaptured a certain place 7 li from Tongguan, thus stabilizing the situation. However, about 5,000 Communist bandits infiltrated Shanxi from western Henan and joined other bandit units 50 li south of Tongguan, threatening the National Army positions in southern Shaanxi.

[Report from the Central News Agency, Xi'an, 27th] A portion of the 10th Brigade and the main force of the 22nd Brigade of the Communist bandits entrenched in An'anhao, Wanjialing, Shancheyu, and Dayu Street, southeast of Tongguan, suffered heavy casualties in an attack by our army. The remnants began to flee southeastward from the 25th, and there are no traces of bandits in various places so far. Outside the town of Guandi, government troops are fighting with bandits.

[Report from our Xuzhou office, 27th] The five columns of Liu's bandits, numbered 1, 2, 3, 6, and 7, in the border area of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui, have been intercepted and fiercely pursued by the National Army for the past month, resulting in the death and injury of more than three-fifths of Liu's bandits. Only small groups of scattered bandits are now harassing the Dabie Mountains. The main force of the bandit remnants has fled to the area between Huangchuan, Gushi, Shangcheng, and Guangshan. The National Army is currently annihilating them, and the focus of the war has clearly shifted to southern Henan.

[Report from our Hefei office, 27th] The main force of the bandit army in Dabie Mountains is distributed as follows: the first and second brigades of the first column are located in Xipuzhen, west of Shangcheng; the fourth and sixth brigades of the second column are located near Gushi, and the fifth brigade is located within Shangcheng County; the seventh and eighth brigades of the third column are located in the Sanhejian area of Gushi, and the ninth brigade is located in Dahua of Huoshan; the sixteenth and seventeenth brigades of the sixth column are located in Gushi, and the eighteenth brigade is located in Luotian; and the seventh column is located in the Luoshan area.

### Communist Bandits in Western Liaoning Corridor Return to Eastern Rehe; The Area West of the Changchun-Gongzhuling Section Enters the Stage of Suppression
[Report from our Panjin office, 27th] The Communist bandits in Jinxi are fleeing to the eastern part of Rehe under the pressure of the National Army, and the Liaoxi Corridor will soon be restored to stability.

[Report from our Changchun office, 27th] The war west of the Changchun-Gongzhuling section is now developing into a stage of suppression. The capture of Huaide is of great benefit to the autumn harvest, and although the bandits seem to have attempted to counterattack due to the attack by the National Army, they have had no effect so far. In the Battle of Huaide, more than 3,000 bandits were killed, and thousands were captured.

[Report from our Baoding office, 27th] The Pingbao Railway was connected at 1:00 p.m. yesterday at kilometer 131 between Xushui and Caohe.

### At the Kaifeng Press Conference, Cheng Qian Discusses Military Affairs; The Bandits' Infiltration of the Central Plains is Indeed a Good Opportunity for Individual Annihilation
[Report from our Kaifeng office, 26th] Cheng Qian held a reception for reporters from Kaifeng and other cities in Henan Province at the Henan Provincial Party Headquarters at 10:00 a.m. today. Cheng first gave a general report on the military situation. According to him, Liu Bocheng's troops, who had infiltrated Henan from western Shandong two months ago in coordination with Chen Yi's westward advance, suffered heavy blows from the National Army. The Yellow River flooded, cutting off their escape route. They had no choice but to lead the remnants of 70,000 bandits south across the Longhai Railway into the border area of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui. They suffered heavy losses in the pursuit and interception by the National Army. Among them, the backbone troops of the 1st and 7th Columns have been routed and reorganized into independent columns. They are currently besieged by the National Army in the northern part of southern Anhui, and their number is less than 50,000, making them easy to annihilate. Chen Geng's troops, numbering 50,000 to 60,000, in western Henan were originally intended to support Liu Bocheng's troops. Although they crossed the river and captured Xin'an, Mianchi, Shanxian, Yanshi, Luoning, Yiyang, Songxian, Yiyang, Yitang, and other places, looting and killing, it was only a short-term harassment and can be easily pacified. Chen Yi's troops, numbering 40,000, in the border area of Henan and Shandong, have recently been active near Heze in support of the war in western Henan. The National Army is currently engaged in fierce fighting with these bandits. In short, the villagers of the Central Plains have suffered from the bandit's invasion south across the river, and their infiltration in separate groups is a good opportunity for the National Army to annihilate them individually. Regarding the election issue in Henan Province, he said that everything is being handled in accordance with the instructions of the central laws and regulations. When reporters asked how elections would be held in newly occupied and semi-occupied areas, he replied that it would be determined after receiving instructions from the central government.

The president began to give a speech, which was earnest and lasted for forty minutes. After the speech, the students gave a reply, and the ceremony was completed. The main points of President Chiang's speech are as follows: 1. To build a new country, we must first build a new police force. The duty of the army is to defend the country and strengthen national defense, while the task of the police is to love the people and maintain social order and tranquility, so that the people can live and work in peace, and politics can have a foundation; 2. In the past, the quality of the police was poor and they could not shoulder the responsibility of building the police and building the country. The new police should have a new spirit, new academic skills, and moral cultivation. Every police officer should manage 10,000 people, influence society, and change the atmosphere, so that the foundation of society is safe, and there is hope for suppressing bandits and building the country. 3. The completion of the later revolution and the construction of a new China depend on the joint efforts of all the staff and students of the school to carry forward the spirit of benevolence and tolerance, so that we can build a new police force and accomplish our mission.

[Report from the Central News Agency, Taipei, 27th] After the Taiwan Provincial Industry and Commerce Bank, Changhua Bank, and South China Bank opened commercial remittances between Shanghai and Taiwan today in accordance with the methods stipulated by the Taiwan Provincial Government yesterday, the black market exchange rate between Taiwan currency and legal tender here has increased from 1:49 to 1:56 in one day.

### The Rape and Murder of a Female Teacher in Wujiang; Five Main Culprits Executed in Beijing by Firing Squad; Spectators Packed the Streets, Cheering
[Report from our Nanjing office, 27th] The five main culprits in the case of the rape and murder of female teacher Zou Yuee in Tongli Town, Wujiang, and the robbery of property, Liu Keming, Zhou Tianquan, Pu Yudan, Peng Hengda, and Zhang Shaoxian, have been sentenced to death by the Military Law Department of the Ministry of National Defense and executed by firing squad at the Tianjiesi execution ground at 3:30 p.m. on the 27th. Spectators packed the streets, cheering. After this case occurred, local people were outraged, causing strikes and market closures. The highest authorities were also greatly angered and repeatedly ordered the military law authorities to thoroughly investigate and handle the case. In August of this year, all the criminals in the case were brought to the Military Law Department in Beijing by the Wujiang District Court for interrogation. After collecting evidence from various sources and repeated interrogations, the proposed judgment was reported to the Chairman. Among them, Peng and Zhang were originally sentenced to life imprisonment, but the verdict was changed to death after approval. The approval order for this case was issued to the Military Law Department on the morning of the 27th. Because the 28th was Sunday and the 29th was the Mid-Autumn Festival, the execution was carried out on the afternoon of the 27th. At about 3:10 p.m., the five criminals were taken out of prison. Seeing the heavily guarded gate and the surrounding photographers, their faces changed drastically and they sweated profusely, but they still tried to calm themselves. They were escorted into the military court. Judge Zhang Xiaosheng asked for their names, ages, and places of origin, and then stood up to announce the main text of the judgment.

The chief culprit, Liu Keming, asked the court to be exempted from being tied up, saying, "If you do wrong, you should of course be punished by the national law." Peng Hengda, who was younger, quickly said: He didn't quite understand why he was dying and asked the court to continue investigating the truth even after his death. The other three criminals remained silent. After the court allowed them to write their wills, they were escorted to a row of five wooden tables prepared outside the court. Peng had just sat down when he suddenly stood up and shouted, "Long live the Republic of China, long live Chairman Chiang!" After getting into the car, Peng and Liu suddenly shouted again that they wanted to write their wills. They were silent only after being tied to the car. The prisoners' special car arrived at Tianjiesi at 3:30 p.m. They were supported to the execution ground by soldiers on the left and right. Peng was in front, and the other four criminals stood in a row behind him, facing east. As they shouted slogans, five shots were fired simultaneously, and all five criminals fell to the ground. Cheers and shouts from the surrounding crowd rang out along with the gunshots. Later, because the criminals were not completely dead, three shots or two shots were added to each, and a maximum of five shots were added before they died.

### Political Reform and the Talent Problem (Part 1)

— Du Zuozhou

The call for political reform has recently resonated throughout the land. "Poverty leads to change, change leads to progress," and now we have indeed reached a critical point where change is imperative. However, when discussing political reform, one cannot help but first think of the issue of talent.

The principles of politics are inherently simple. "Those who gain talent prosper, those who lose talent perish." This cliché still holds true for China today, which has not yet embarked on the right track of the rule of law. While we do not advocate "rule by men" or promote a "government of good people," we also believe that heroic or impulsive political reforms are by no means the fundamental solution to today's political problems. However, we have a new perspective on the importance of talent: we believe that democracy, in a narrow sense, should be a political system where "everyone can give full play to their talents." Because political problems, in the final analysis, are always inseparable from human problems. The founding father Sun Yat-sen said, "Politics is the affair of the people, and managing the affairs of the people is politics." If these "people" are all incompetent, and those who "manage the affairs of the people" are not all like Zhuge Liang, then there is undoubtedly a need for talent. This is the minimum requirement for modern democracy; otherwise, so-called "democracy" will degenerate into "dictatorship" or "fooling the people."

The approach to talent varies from era to era. In feudal autocratic times, the focus was simply on passively seeking loyalty and obedience, with the main goal of preventing rebellion. Therefore, in addition to adopting a policy of "the people can be made to follow, but not to understand" for dealing with the masses, scholars were subjected to a cage-like policy centered on the imperial examinations, with the aim of "bringing all the heroes of the world into my control." In the eyes of feudal rulers, the best talent was essentially a slave, so there was naturally no talk of "everyone giving full play to their talents." In a democracy, the meaning of everyone giving full play to their talents is threefold: first, to cultivate talent, so that everyone can freely and fully develop their individuality and genius; second, to employ talent, so that talent has an outlet and each person can find their place; and third, to maintain talent, so that each person can settle into their position and express their ambitions. Solving the talent problem not only passively promotes political integrity and stability, but the complexity and specialization of modern politics make it impossible to succeed without specialized talent. Furthermore, the true spirit of democracy can only be realized when all those who "manage the affairs of the people" have the hope of freely and equally developing their talents and ambitions in politics.

First, consider the nature of politics itself: corruption and incompetence are generally criticized by public opinion. We do not need to wait for Wedemeyer's criticism; we have long recognized the need for "political and economic reform." But when it comes down to it, human factors always play a major role. A good system from Europe and America, when brought to China, often "changes its nature when transplanted north of the Huai River"; and any good-sounding plan or program, when implemented, either changes in quality or goes wrong. Therefore, I believe that when discussing reform in politics today, personnel is the most important factor, and systems and programs are secondary. If the personnel remains the same, no matter how the systems and programs change, it is like changing the soup but not the medicine. In short, the seriousness of the talent problem is the main problem in today's politics!

However, "in a village of ten households, there must be loyal and trustworthy people." The country is not without talent, but it depends on how talent is cultivated, used, and treated. We can say that the current phenomenon is a large-scale waste of talent! The country has been running education for decades, producing many talented individuals, but they are all the result of arduous efforts. Today, we see a large-scale waste of talent, which is a heartbreaking phenomenon.

First, in terms of cultivating talent, we find errors in the educational methods. Because cultivating talent is for the needs of the country, the country should have correct plans and reasonable guidance on how much talent to cultivate in certain departments and professions, and what kind of appropriate professional training to give to certain individuals in order to achieve a balanced development of talent in terms of quantity and quality. Especially the latter, namely guidance on career selection, which we believe is a prerequisite for cultivating talent. The most advanced education systems in Europe and America require students applying to specialized schools to undergo tests in personality, psychology, intelligence, and academic performance to determine the most suitable standard for their career choice and education, which is the same intention as "teaching students according to their aptitude" in ancient China. However, we who run education have neglected this point too much. The choice of major depends only on the subjective willingness of the learner or the accidental opportunities of the environment. We simply do not have good and responsible guidance on career choices to enable students to fully develop their individual abilities. We do not know how much of their learning genius has been buried! The lack of academic freedom and research atmosphere, the general lack of equipment and teaching materials, the mechanical and rigid teaching methods, and the disconnection between education and real life are undoubtedly serious shortcomings in talent cultivation. But schools, according to the prescribed models, produce batches of "talents" in name only, considering that they have fulfilled their educational responsibilities, and graduates receive a diploma, which is considered a tool for begging for food from society. We should solemnly point out that this kind of crude and shoddy production of talent is actually the starting point for losing talent!

Second, due to the above reasons, coupled with the backwardness of social production, the entire political system being off track, and the bad habit of all parties valuing relationships over talent in employing people, it has become a very natural phenomenon that graduation means unemployment. Now everyone knows to pay attention to science and engineering, and the authorities are also trying their best to promote them, but the unemployment of science, engineering, agriculture, and medicine graduates is no less than that of other subjects. Without the backing of personal relationships, no matter how great your skills, you will not have a place to stand. Even if you are lucky enough to get a position, it is often learning not being used for what it is, or using what is not learned. For example, those who studied business become shop assistants, and those who studied mechanics handle taxes, which has become a common sight in society. We often hear about the promotion of "expert politics" and "efficient politics," but the allocation of talent is so inappropriate, experts are turned away, and efficiency is deteriorating. However, all parties often lament the situation of "everyone looking for a job, but no one to do the job." Today, talent is either wasted or misplaced, and the country's employment has long been in a state of anarchy. In this way, how can politics not be bad? How can society not be chaotic?

### Soviet Union Proposes Withdrawal of Troops from Korea, US Official Reaction Cold, Rhee Syngman Firmly Opposes, Believing It Would Lead to Civil War, Rumors of 200,000 North Korean Communist Troops

[United Press Washington, 26th] The Soviet Union's proposal that US and Soviet troops simultaneously withdraw from Korea next spring is seen by the US Foreign Office as a propaganda tactic to influence the United Nations General Assembly's discussion of the Korean issue. The Soviet Union does not want its proposal to be scrutinized. According to the 1945 Moscow Agreement, the Allied powers would administer Korea for five years before granting it full independence. The complete withdrawal of US and Soviet troops at this time would allow Korea to be controlled by the communists, who are well-organized in the Soviet-occupied zone.

[United Press Seoul, 27th] South Korean political leader Rhee Syngman declared today that if the Soviet Union's proposal that US and Soviet occupation forces simultaneously withdraw next spring were to be realized, civil war would inevitably break out in Korea, and the north would become a second Manchuria.

[United Press Tokyo, 27th] US Undersecretary of the Army Draper said today that, based on what he saw in Korea, it is very clear that the whole country needs an independent and unified democratic government. Korea is currently divided into two zones, with heavy industry in the north and agriculture and light industry in the south, and the south needs raw materials from the north, but because there is an armed border between them, they cannot communicate with each other. The United States wanted to unify Korea but was unsuccessful, so it submitted the issue to the United Nations, and the Soviet Union's proposal to withdraw from Korea followed closely, which is noteworthy.

[New Asia News Agency Seoul, 27th] Well-informed sources said, "The Soviet Union's sudden proposal for the simultaneous withdrawal of US and Soviet occupation forces from Korea is a countermeasure to the United States' proposal to include the Korean issue on the agenda of the United Nations General Assembly. If the US and the Soviet Union implement the withdrawal of troops stationed in Korea, the situation in Korea will become even more chaotic, as the Soviet Union has trained about 200,000 communist troops in the north and established a communist people's government, while South Korea has only about 50,000 police and security forces, and only a temporary legislative body politically."

[New Asia News Agency Seoul, 27th] US representative to the US-Soviet Joint Commission, Major General Brown, said today that the Soviet propaganda is false and mostly exaggerated. The Soviet representatives demanded that South Korea release the recently arrested conspirators and announced this to the world. We must know that the Soviet Union has no right to interfere in any of South Korea's measures.

### After Britain Announced its Palestine Policy, Both Arabs and Jews Expressed Skepticism, Jewish Representative Shertok Held a Long Talk

[Our Newspaper] London, 27th broadcast; The British Foreign Office announced that once the United Nations General Assembly has made a decision on the Palestine issue, Britain will withdraw 100,000 troops from the Holy Land. Well-informed sources predict that this withdrawal may be a preliminary action, and all troops will be withdrawn within two months. The British government insists that the UN General Assembly must make a decision on the Palestine issue at this session and must not delay any further, but if the United Nations needs to establish international institutions and cannot do so in a short period of time, Britain may postpone the complete withdrawal of troops, but the time cannot exceed two months. The "Daily Mail" reported that the Soviet Union deliberately moved Jews from Eastern Europe to Palestine to make it difficult for the British and supplied the Jews with marks printed in the Soviet-occupied zone of Germany, disrupting the financial situation in the British and American zones of Germany.

[United Press Jerusalem, 26th]

British Colonial Secretary Creech Jones made a statement at the UN General Assembly

, willing to hand over the mandate of Palestine, which

both Jews and Arabs heard with

skepticism. Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Jewish Agency, David Ben-Gurion, said that

the British statement did not specify when

it would withdraw from Palestine, only saying it would withdraw as soon as possible,

which is meaningless.

[United Press London, 26th] An Arab League spokesperson announced today: Britain's decision

to withdraw from Palestine as soon as possible

is supported by us, but we will oppose

United Nations institutions replacing

Britain's position and continuing to administer Palestine.

The Arab nation insists on its unwavering

position of unconditionally taking over Palestine.

[Reuters Lake Success, New York, 26th]

Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Jewish Agency and President of the Zionist Organization of America, Silver, and

Political Director of the Jewish Agency, Shertok,

visited Marshall today for an hour to

discuss the United States' attitude towards the Palestine issue.

Also, after British Colonial Secretary Creech Jones's statement in the UN General Assembly's Palestine Committee, the

representatives of the Arab countries and the Jewish Agency immediately held separate meetings to

secretly discuss future policies.

### Polish Representative Harshly Criticizes Marshall Plan

[Our Newspaper] New York, 27th broadcast: Polish representative Lange,

attending the UN General Assembly,

criticized the Marshall Plan in the General Assembly today and advocated that the United Nations institutions be responsible for

assisting the economic recovery of Europe. Lange believes that the implementation of the Marshall Plan will

divide Europe into two, and economic prosperity, like peace, is indivisible. The Marshall

Plan cannot play a significant role because it separates the eastern and western parts of Europe, but what Europe needs

is mutual assistance between Eastern and Western Europe and mutual

adjustment of resources.

### After McNeil Criticized the Soviet Union, the Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Retorted, Also Accusing Dulles, Bullitt, and Others of Inciting War

[Reuters Lake Success, 26th

] Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister and Chief

Representative to the UN General Assembly, Vyshinsky (pictured), held a grand

press conference in this

Security Council meeting room, attended by about six hundred people.

Vyshinsky continued to criticize certain leading figures in the United States, accusing Republican

foreign policy expert Dulles and former US

diplomat Bullitt of being warmongers. He also pointed out that British Minister of State McNeil's remarks

were full of fabricated lies defaming the Soviet Union. Vyshinsky said: McNeil claims to be

an expert on Marxism, but unfortunately, when discussing the issue of warmongers,

McNeil suddenly lost his ability to speak.

The list of American warmongers released by Vyshinsky today

included two more people than the last time,

one being former US Ambassador to the Soviet Union Bullitt and the other being

radio commentator Winchell. Vyshinsky pointed out that McNeil's remarks had three remarkable

characteristics: one was that he defended Churchill, one was

his accusation that Egypt was ungrateful to Britain, and one was

his theory of sovereignty. In addition to reporters, several diplomats were also present at today's reception.

McNeil was only present for five minutes, and he withdrew as soon as Vyshinsky

criticized him.

### Foreign Communist Journalists Allowed to Cover UN News

[United Press Washington, 27th] The

government today allowed foreign communist journalists to come to the United States

to cover news of the United Nations General Assembly. A reporter from a certain

French communist newspaper has now been granted permission to report to his country

on the opening of the General Assembly, but must

return to Paris immediately at the end of the General Assembly. According to the Department of Justice

, this new policy is broader than the restrictions

on American journalists at the Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference,

and will not be used beyond the General Assembly. All

communist journalists entering the country must have a formal mission.

### United States Proposes to the United Nations General Assembly to Establish a Standing Committee to Balance and Handle International Disputes with the Security Council

[Reuters Lake Success, New York, 26th] The United States

today proposed a plan to establish a 55-nation Standing Committee, which

fully recognizes that the Security Council has the primary responsibility to take prompt and

effective action to maintain international peace and security. The main functions of the Standing Committee include:

*  Examining and reporting on situations deemed likely to hinder

the general welfare and friendly relations described under Article 14 of the Charter, or issues submitted to the General Assembly by the Security Council;

*  Examining and making recommendations on general principles of cooperation for maintaining international peace and security, and studying methods of promoting international cooperation and making recommendations;

*  Examining whether any issues require the convening of a special session of the General Assembly;

*  Presiding over investigations, appointing investigation committees;

*  Studying and recommending whether the committee should be rewritten into a permanent institution after a one-year trial period.

US representative Dulles said at a press conference

that this committee may be convened to discuss treaty

issues. Marshall had previously foreshadowed in Moscow that if the Austrian treaty did not make progress,

the matter should be submitted to the General Assembly, in which case it would be studied by the

Standing Committee. The Standing Committee may also study the Korean issue and the revision of the treaty with Italy, etc.

These issues have been placed on the agenda of the General Assembly. Regarding the Italian issue,

the United States is not yet prepared to

express its final opinion on whether it is appropriate to revise the treaty. The United States' goal is to

deal with issues that can be resolved through direct negotiation. Dulles also said that the committee was originally named

the "General Assembly Standing Committee on Peace and Security,"

but the words "Peace and Security" have now been deleted, with no

special meaning. Dulles later said that the Standing Committee will also examine issues

known to be submitted to the next General Assembly. According to Article 35 of the Charter,

member states have the option of submitting issues to the Security Council or the General Assembly. Dulles also said that Vyshinsky's criticism of this proposal was

not well thought out beforehand and that he expected that after careful consideration, he would realize that his

opposition was unjustified.

### Pakistan's Hatred of Indians: Gandhi Unwilling to Stand Idly By; Resort to War if Necessary

[Special Dispatch from United Press, New Delhi, 27th] Gandhi, known throughout the world for his opposition to violence,

nevertheless, in a prayer meeting yesterday, authorized a representative to declare that if Pakistan does not acknowledge

its wrongdoing in its treatment of Indians and Sikhs, then India may "have to fight a war" against it. Gandhi is unwilling to

stand idly by until all exiled Indians and Sikhs are honorably returned to Pakistan.

The Mahatma opposes all wars, but there is no other way to

seek justice from Pakistan. If the Muslim dominion does not admit its mistakes

and instead tries to conceal them, then the Indian dominion

will have no choice but to resort to war. War is no trivial matter,

and no one wants war, but he has never advised

anyone to submit to injustice.

### French Tram and Bus Services Halt; Social Affairs Bureau's Efforts to Urge Resumption Fail; Labor Proposes Six Demands, Company Unresponsive

[Report from this newspaper] Over two thousand seven hundred employees of the French Water and Electricity Company

began a general work slowdown yesterday at 1:20 PM. French Red

buses and all levels of trams have all entered the depot and ceased operation; however, the hundred-plus workers in the electricity generation and water supply sections are still maintaining their work. The Social Affairs Bureau immediately dispatched personnel

to urge a resumption of work, but to no avail. All the workers gathered

at the company's union offices and in the square, and no resolution had been reached by evening.

The cause of this labor dispute lies in the accumulation of long-standing grievances between labor and management, and the labor organization is taking this opportunity to seek a thorough resolution. Labor has put forward six demands:

The company should clearly stipulate the standard for salary increase grades for staff. (The workers' portion was resolved by the Social Affairs Bureau's mediation at the end of last year.) Revision of the car service regulations. Undertake welfare initiatives: A, hospital for employees' families; B, employee dormitories; C, educational funds. Before these are implemented, a monthly subsidy of 15 yuan per person. Improve the facilities of schools for workers' children. Two days of leave per month without deduction of pay. Mid-Autumn Festival loan of 500,000 yuan per person, to be repaid in installments. Labor also limited the company authorities to respond before 12:00 noon. Around 1:00 PM, the company had not responded, and all French tram lines

and Red buses successively returned to the depot and went on strike.

The Social Affairs Bureau ordered the union to send representatives to the Social Affairs Bureau for negotiations, but the person in charge of the union did not go.

When the company's industrial union held a temporary meeting in the union square around 4:00 PM, the Social Affairs Bureau, upon hearing the news, dispatched inspector Zhu Chenghao to the

scene to express three opinions to the employees: The employees did not report this action to the Social Affairs Bureau in advance. All the issues raised should be resolved according to the law.

Immediately restore traffic. However, the employees did not heed the advice.

British Trams Once Obstructed

After the French trams went on strike, several dozen unidentified people

on Nanjing Road

obstructed the British Nos. 1 and 2 tram lines, claiming to be acting on the orders of Qiu Changjiang, chairman of the British Tram

Union, to halt services in support of the French employees. As a result, more than ten trams on lines 1 and 2 were obstructed. However, the British Tram Union clarified that it did not send anyone to obstruct the trams.

According to a message released by the Social Affairs Bureau last night: regarding the sudden strike by French tram workers today, the competent authorities have determined that the conditions put forward by the workers this time are

unreasonable and resemble coercion with a deadline, and the union has been ordered to immediately resume work or be considered as voluntarily resigning and be dismissed by the company. If the union cannot control the situation, it will be ordered to disband and personnel will be sent to reorganize it. At the same time, some people yesterday misused the name of the British tram union to forcibly obstruct the operation of vehicles, and they have been arrested by military and police

authorities to maintain public transport.

### Strike Before Arbitration Clearly Violates the Mobilization Order; Statements from the Mayor and Director of the Social Affairs Bureau

[Report from this newspaper] Regarding the

strike by the workers of the French Water and Electricity Company,

Mayor Wu, together with Director Wu Kaixian of the Social Affairs Bureau,

temporarily summoned reporters from various newspapers yesterday afternoon to issue a statement saying: The French Water and Electricity Company

workers are demanding a salary increase of 15 yuan and

an increase in grade level, which is clearly an increase in base salary.

Increasing the base salary violates the central government's explicit orders. Furthermore, they

went on strike without going through arbitration procedures and demanded that the company

authorities respond before 12:00 noon.

All of the above actions not only violate labor law,

but also violate the government's general mobilization order. This matter may be related to

the Shanghai Power Company's dismissal of communist workers,

so relevant parties have been ordered to investigate strictly. Deserving

workers will be allowed to return to work, while undesirable elements

will be punished. Mayor Wu also said that the British tram

company workers themselves did not want to strike, but

were incited by undesirable elements using the union's name.

At the same time, the company's trams were obstructed by criminals,

so the police bureau has been ordered to pay close attention

and arrest them immediately upon discovery. Currently, some

of the British Tram Company workers have resumed work.

The mayor also mentioned the case of the arrest of communist

activists at the Datong Printing House, saying that 13

people have been arrested, with one person surrendering, and

15 more are at large. The strike by the workers of the Water and Electricity Company

yesterday may have been instigated by the communists at large, and the municipal government will deal with it severely.

Director Wu Kaixian added to the reporters that the

workers of the French Water and Electricity Company did not report to

the Social Affairs Bureau before the strike, nor did they report

after the fact. The Social Affairs Bureau sent people to investigate upon hearing the news and warned the workers

that strike action was not permitted. The workers disregarded

the law. The union held a meeting at 3:00 PM, and

Zhu Chenghao of the Social Affairs Bureau attended and once again

warned them to resume work immediately. The responsibility should be borne by the

union. According to Zhu's report, the union representatives

asked the Social Affairs Bureau "why it wanted to disband the union,"

but in fact, the Social Affairs Bureau did not disband the union, which

is clearly being incited by others.

### Publication of September Cost of Living Index

Workers: 34,400 times; Staff: 30,800 times

[Report from this newspaper] The city's September cost of living index has been compiled

and finalized by the Municipal Government Research Office and was published yesterday. The general cost of living index for workers is 34,400 times,

an increase of 11% compared to the previous month. The general cost of living index for staff is 30,800 times,

an increase of 15% compared to the previous month. The breakdown of the indices is as follows:

Index compiled by the union is similar.

The Shanghai Municipal Cost of Living Index Compilation and Review Committee

held its fifth meeting at the Municipal Government yesterday morning

at 10:00 AM, chaired by Statistics Director Zhang Zongmeng. He reported that prices for this month

have generally increased. The reason why the worker index increased less than the staff index is that the price of

Jing rice increased more than Xian rice; workers use Xian rice and have rationed rice. Fish increased by 13%,

vegetable prices fell, oil, salt, and sugar rose, with rationing, and coal briquettes rose by 50%, but workers

have rationed coal. Cloth was stable in the first half of the month and rose in the second half, so the impact was not significant. Staff

had higher indices because of the increased price of tap water and movies, and no rationed rice or coal. Zhang

expressed great satisfaction that the labor union's independent survey and compilation of the cost of living index were similar to the index published by the Municipal Government.

Union Chairman Shui Xiangyun and Director Zhang Zhusan reported on the process of conducting field surveys in different districts, which coincided with the Municipal Government, so the labor sector can absolutely trust it.

### Humorous Case of Traitor: Genuine or Fake Zhu Ji; Members of the 1911 Revolution Comrades Association with the Same Name Implicated; Secret Accusation

[Report from this newspaper]

The Jiangsu High Court

is handling the case of the

traitor Zhu Ji. Because the defendant's whereabouts are unknown, an arrest warrant has been issued. Now, the 1911

Revolution Comrades Association has sent a letter to the court, stating that the association has a comrade, also named

Zhu Ji, who is from Xiuning, Anhui, and is 61 years old. It is unknown whether the age and birthplace of the wanted

Zhu Ji are the same, and a request is made for verification. After the High Court

examined the indictment of the traitor Zhu Ji, it was stated that he was from Ningbo, Zhejiang,

and is 40 years old, which is different from what the association stated. By coincidence, there is also a Shen Youxin who secretly informed the court, saying that

Zhu Ji is nearly 50 years old, has a rectangular face, and because he has a mole above his eyebrow, he often wears a copper basin hat

to cover it up, and uses the name of the 1911 Revolution Comrades Association as a cover. Please check whether this Zhu Ji has held the positions of

pseudo "Fengxian County Magistrate" and pseudo "Shanghai Special Municipality Fengxian District Director."

The High Court received these two letters and, because the truth is difficult to discern,

and the facts are unknown, and because Zhu Ji of the 1911 Revolution Comrades Association is in Shanghai, it entrusted

the local court of this city to conduct an inquiry. The court opened at 2:00 PM yesterday,

presided over by Judge Huang Guangyu, who summoned and questioned the 61-year-old Zhu Ji about whether he had ever worked in Fengxian.

He replied: "I have never worked there. After seeing the report in the newspaper,

I wanted to declare to the Jiangsu High Court, but I thought that there are many people in the world with the same name, such as the Shanghai Mayor, Wu Guozhen, who has fourteen people with the same name,

so I gave up. During the War of Resistance, I never went to Fengxian." The court asked where he was during the War of Resistance.

He replied that he was in the Tenth War Zone and was asked if he knew Shen Youxin. He replied that he did not know him. This Zhu Ji, who had no mole above his eyebrow, then said, "I am one of the founders of the 1911 Revolution Comrades Association.

I participated in the revolution during the Huanghuagang Uprising and have never been a district

director." Zhou Dingsan of the 1911 Revolution Comrades Association then testified to the court, "The association had an official letter sent to the High Court requesting verification,

but this Zhu Ji today is not that traitor Zhu Ji that the Jiangsu High Court wants. If this Zhu Ji is that Zhu Ji, then

we would not have written a letter to defend him."

Yesterday morning, the Public Utilities and Legal Regulations Committees held a joint meeting to discuss the draft contract and made amendments to Articles 13, 15, and 24 of the draft.

At the afternoon meeting to discuss the draft contract, Director Zhao Zengjue of the Public Utilities Bureau first explained, saying: "I believe

that this case is the most important proposal in this General Assembly. The establishment of the

Joint Power Plant will determine the future economic development of this city. The Joint Electric Power Company is proposed to be organized jointly by

Zhabei, Huashang, Pudong, Hangzhou and other Electric Power Co., Ltd., Shanghai Huxi Power Company, and Shanghai Power Company. It is a cooperative

institution of Sino-US enterprises. At present, the French Power Company has not been invited to participate, because it was not occupied by the enemy during the occupation period and cannot bear

the Japanese compensation motors. The main purpose is to reduce costs after the joint venture, so that the citizens of Shanghai can obtain

cheap electricity. The company can borrow 20 million US dollars from American businesses and can repay it over a long period of time. However,

regarding the phrase "This contract authorizes the President of the International Court of Justice" in the third line of Article 13 of the draft, just as

Councilor Ma Junshuo said, "The United Changli Company is a Chinese legal person and should abide by Chinese law, and should not authorize the President of the International Court of Justice." I also

agree with this point. Now it has been amended by the Public Utilities and Legal Regulations Committees, adding "After obtaining the consent of the Chinese judge and the American judge residing in the court, an arbitrator will be appointed" after this sentence.

Considered an Insult to National Sovereignty

Councilor Huang

Bingquan First Expressed

Support For

the formation of the Joint Electric Power Company, Councilor Bu Yongsheng

first expressed his opposition, believing that this electric power company

is purely for private profit. After the joint venture,

foreigners have an opportunity to annex the entire electric power company, so please retain this proposal and delay the contract. Fei Shusheng

continued, "After the conclusion of this type of contract, there is a loss of

our sovereignty, such as the so-called "authorization to the President of the International Court of Justice" in Article 13 of the contract, which is a disrespect for

our national laws. For decades, our country's enterprises have been bound by foreign capital.

Now that we have been slightly liberated, we should not be bound by foreign capital again in the future."

Zhang Zhihan believes that the contract clauses, especially Article 13, are simply "loss of power" and "insulting to the country."

He advocated retention, not for discussion, and asked the municipal government to send it to the Legislative Yuan for research first.

Explanation of Three Misunderstandings

Councilor Li Kaidi

Explained the Misunderstandings

of the Councilors, saying: The Joint Electric Power Company was convened by the municipal government and agreed upon by foreigners.

It was not initiated and organized by foreigners, so it cannot be said to be an attempt by foreigners to annex it. Solving the electricity shortage at present cannot be done without foreign exchange.

If the contract is not subject to the regulations of the Chinese company law, it would be considered a loss of power and insult to the country. This draft contract stipulates that it should be subject to the restrictions of the Chinese company law, so it cannot be considered a loss of power and insult to the country.

Zhu Wende also said that this draft contract seemed inappropriate at first, but after careful study, there was nothing inappropriate. It would be best to ask the central government

to study it. If no point of loss of power and insult to the country can be found, then we can accept it. But it would be best if the government could be self-reliant. Li Wenjie also said that this draft contract

is not inappropriate. Because for the organization of a legal person, if it is to be dissolved

or reorganized, the consent of three-quarters of the shareholders is required. At present, the shares invested by the Americans are less than 50%, and

the Americans really have no power to control the shares. This matter is quite cost-effective. At the same time, no point of loss of power and insult to the country can be found in it, but for the sake of careful consideration, please extend the discussion to the next meeting.

Hope for Careful Consideration

Lu Shidao said

that he picked up this

draft contract with anxiety, and entrusting such an important

organization to an organization that is not sure whether it is reliable or not for thirty-three years is really not reassuring.

Therefore, he hoped for careful consideration, and asked experts to study it first before discussing it. Jiang Huaisu also did not agree, believing that it was not easy to cancel unequal treaties after eight years of war, and now there is such a contract again.

At the same time, how could a country be a country if a local incident in one country

is turned into an international issue and a request is made to the International Court of Justice for a judgment? Wang Xianqing

said that there was not only no, but "not a single" point of loss of power and insult to the country in the draft contract. It is not against national policy for our country's people to jointly run enterprises with foreign businesses.

But Tao Baichuan firmly stated that there were indeed those who lost power and insulted the country. He solemnly requested that the discussion be retained until the next meeting, and that a thirty-three year contract should not be signed rashly in order to delay it for three months.

As a result, Zhan Wengu put forward two specific opinions: Can you please submit the original English manuscript for the councilors to refer to again.

The council will continue to study it, and please also have our country's true legal experts or seniors, such as Wang Chonghui, study it together.

Mayor Expressed His Opinion

Mayor Wu

Expressed His Opinion

Saying that self-reliance is certainly very much in favor, but looking at the facts of China, in the recent twenty or thirty years, construction projects cannot be done without foreign investment. He listed that the urban construction projects in the United States before the First World War were all invested by the United Kingdom.

Now foreign capital is not using us, but we are using foreign capital. This cannot be considered a loss of power and insult to the country, but can be called devotion to the country. In addition, when the United Kingdom invested in the United States, there were many problems that arose, and they were also adjudicated by the International Court of Justice. Therefore, in order not to strike a blow to the absorption of foreign capital, on the one hand, according to the procedure, it should be sent to the Executive Yuan to be handed over to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to study whether it is a loss of power and insult to the country, and on the other hand,

the council will study it again to allow sufficient time for consideration.

After hearing this, Councilor Tao Baichuan said that the local government should not send a proposal to the Executive Yuan before it has been resolved by the local legislative body. Mayor Changjue felt that Councilor Tao's opinion was very correct, and changed his words to ask the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to study it.

### Discussion Will Be Continued at the Next Meeting

In the end, the Speaker summarized the various

opinions:

All the opinions of the councilors during the discussion at this meeting will be

recorded. If there are any details that are not clear,

please ask the councilors to submit written supplements

to the secretariat.

The above records will be sent to the municipal government and forwarded to the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for research. The municipal government is requested to reprint the original English manuscript of the draft contract and distribute it to the councilors for research.

This case will be retained for discussion at the next meeting. The General Assembly unanimously passed the above opinions, and the debate on this case came to a temporary end.

### Opening Zhejiang Road Bridge

[Report from this newspaper] Yesterday, the Council, regarding the Speaker's motion

[Our Peiping Dispatch, 27th] Li Shuhua, vice president of the Peiping Research Institute, said upon his return to Peiping that financial difficulties are affecting the work of the institute. The institute has not added any equipment for ten years, and various departments urgently need to replenish their supplies.

The original plan to build an atomic research building in Peiping with 5 billion yuan may not be easy to realize. Even building a small atomic research institute requires 200,000 US dollars. Therefore, the relocation of the Shanghai Radium Research Institute to Peiping will be difficult to achieve in the short term. Everything depends on the central government increasing the education budget to 15% of the total budget.

Professors from Northeastern Universities Request the Ministry of Education to Improve Their Treatment and Request Foreign Exchange to Replenish Equipment
[Our report, 27th] The Professors' Association of Northeastern Universities has telegraphed the Ministry of Education requesting improved treatment, including the provision of food as in Beijing and Shanghai, free winter coal, and subsidies for winter clothing. The reason given is that cotton cloth, wool fabric, rice, flour, and daily necessities in the Northeast are supplied from within the customs, and prices are higher than within the customs, making monthly income insufficient to maintain life, facing the risk of freezing and starvation. They also requested the allocation of sufficient funds and foreign exchange to replenish the books, instruments, and equipment of Northeastern universities and colleges so that they can reach modern cultural standards. It was also stated that the Japanese gathered Japanese students from puppet universities in Manchuria near Kyushu this spring, providing them with sufficient funds to specialize in the study of Northeastern issues in our country. In contrast, our treatment is not as good as that of public servants in state-owned institutions. If people value the root and we pursue the tip, isn't the future of the Northeast sad?

### Female Thief Case: Dancing Girl Commits Robbery with Accomplices, Police Officers Disguise Themselves to Make Arrest

[Our Dispatch] A female thief case was cracked in the Jinshan Dance Hall on Hankou Road in this city the other day, which was quite like a movie plot. A dancing girl named Cao Ping (originally named Cao Ruiying, 25 years old, from Jiangsu) partnered with her lover Zhang Guanglie and friend Zhang Nianchun on the evening of July 7th this year to rob the home of Cai Zhu on Kuaiji Road No. 43, stealing gold rings, gold ingots, and other items. However, when the victim screamed for help, Zhang Guanglie fled from the front door when he heard the police arrive. Cao and Zhang Nianchun exited through the back door, and in the chaos, the two separated. At that time, police officers and passersby gathered, and Chang arrested Zhang Nianchun, while Cao escaped when the target shifted.

After finding her lover Zhang Guanglie, Cao went to the Bund Park to report the incident. She gave a pistol to Zhang to take to Pudong, and has not been heard from since. Cao had no one to rely on and had no choice but to live in the Xinle Palace Theater in the New Hostel on Hubei Road and joined the Jinshan Dance Troupe as a dance partner until now.

After receiving news of Cao, the police bureau sent police officers Shao Guanrong and Zhang Yunming, disguised as dance guests, to name Cao Ping in the Jinshan Dance Hall, sat at her table and danced with her, and were exceptionally enthusiastic, especially inquiring about Cao's background. Cao inadvertently revealed her real name during this exhaustive questioning. At that time, the two police officers showed their identities and immediately arrested her.

The pistol belonged to Zhang Nianchun, and Zhang Guanglie is now in Pudong, but his address is unknown. In addition to continuing to investigate Zhang's arrest, Cao was transferred to the prosecutor's office yesterday for interrogation.

### Summer in Autumn: Yesterday's Temperature Reached a High of 96 Degrees, Meteorological Observatory Predicts No Moon for Mid-Autumn Festival

It is late autumn, but the weather is abnormal. Yesterday, the highest temperature reached 96 degrees, and the lowest was 77 degrees. According to meteorological sources, this sudden warming is due to tropical air currents in the Pacific basin invading the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, resulting in oppressive heat that swept away all signs of autumn. However, a strong cold current from the Lake Baikal region in Siberia has been moving southeastward, and it is expected to reach the lower reaches of the Yangtze River this afternoon, where it will come into contact with the stagnant hot air. The weather is expected to cool down, and it is predicted that the weather in the city this morning will be muggy, but after 5 p.m., due to the invasion of the cold air center, the temperature will drop significantly, and there may be local showers. Tomorrow is the Mid-Autumn Festival according to the lunar calendar, and the observatory predicts that the weather may be overcast and rainy, so there will be no bright moon to admire this year.

### A Scare on the Edge of Hefei

Two Battalions of Bandit Troops Annihilated in the Battle of Taoxi Town

Because Hefei occupies an

important strategic position,

when the bandit troops occupied

Luan and Shucheng,

they actively moved

towards Hefei from the south

and southwest, reaching

a close proximity of fifty li

from Hefei. At that time, the

troops defending Hefei had more

than enough strength, but going

out to meet them was militarily a near miss. How many bandits entered Anhui has always been a mystery. Military estimates put the number at about six or seven thousand. It was not until a unit of the National Army's XXX Division arrived in Hefei, followed by the entire XXX Division, that they launched attacks from the south and southwest, and the bandit troops fled in disarray. In the Battle of Taoxi Town, as many as two battalions were annihilated.

All Agencies Ordered to Adopt Contingency Measures

When the news of the abandonment of Luan

reached Hefei,

the provincial government agencies began

contingency measures.

Each employee received two months' salary,

important documents were packed into boxes, and Chairman Li

Pinxian ordered each agency to

expedite work, store

grain and grass, and rush to build city

defenses. These were originally

should be and necessary,

but "sensitive" people thought the situation was serious, and people were scaring each other. Any rumor was not judged for truth or falsehood and was quickly spread. Every face on the street showed a look of panic. Rickshaw drivers and porters temporarily increased in price tenfold, only allowed to open their mouths to ask for money, not allowed to haggle. Those who could not leave Hefei decided to stay and stored rice and grass, so the price of rice broke the 300,000 mark, especially firewood, with the highest price being 110,000 per load. The Security Command issued a notice strictly prohibiting making please or raising prices.

Boxes and Cages in the Backflow, People's Hearts Tend to Stabilize

Until the afternoon of the thirteenth,

Taoxi Town was recovered, and

sixty prisoners were escorted. Also,

National Army troops went to the southwestern countryside to search

for scattered bandits who had disintegrated into smaller groups.

The people of Hefei began to feel

calm. Today, boxes

and luggage are gradually returning.

People no longer feel as

shocked by the military works

in the streets and alleys as they did before.

People of Hefei should remain calm

and vigilant,

and increase their vigilance.

### Recovering Shucheng

Our reporter took a car

on the 21st to Shucheng,

seventy kilometers from Hefei,

which had just been recovered

from the bandits, and was detained for three hours. When he entered the city, many shops were still not open, and there were few pedestrians on the street, like stars in the morning. A tall tower in the northeast corner of the city stood quietly in the autumn sun, and the scene appeared very desolate.

The bandit troops arrived in Shucheng at dawn on the 7th. Except for the agencies that had time to evacuate, many old people were still dreaming. When they woke up, they realized that everything had changed and turned into a world of bandit bandits!

After the bandits occupied the county seat, they sent a Shandong native named Zhao Fujian to serve as the puppet county magistrate. It is said that this Zhao had been disguised in Shucheng "waiting for a vacancy" a month ago. After "taking office," he summoned those who had not had time to escape to a meeting, talking nonsense, and pretending to be benevolent and righteous on the one hand, saying that he would not disturb the people, and on the other hand, he mobilized 2,000 people to attack Taoxi Town. However, the fox's tail could not be hidden. With a shake of the body, revealing the hideous face, extorted from the local area, asking for 150 million, and under the pressure of violence, who dared to haggle. At the same time, for those who had more food and clothing, they used the excuse of investigating the household registration to search them one by one, raping, robbing, which was more severe than the Japanese during the War of Resistance. In the eleven days, Shucheng's wealth was looted.

Li Pinxian, Chairman of the Anhui Provincial Government

[Our dispatch from Hefei on the 23rd] This time, the bandit troops of Liu Bocheng's unit roamed from southern Henan to Anhui. In twenty days, they successively broke into ten county seats, and five million people suffered direct disasters. Now, the key military county towns in central and western Anhui have been recovered one after another, and the bandit troops' momentum seems to have passed. However, the bandit troops avoid attacking fortifications, and even when there is a road to escape, they dare not contact the National Army. Its main force has not yet been annihilated and is still lingering in the Dabie Mountains.

Xia Wei, Commander of the Eighth Appeasement Zone

An elderly man told the reporter that the bandit troops in Shucheng preached that everyone had food to eat, but they looted Shucheng empty, only they had food to eat, and the common people had no food to eat. During the occupation, the common people longed for the National Army as much as a great drought longs for rain clouds. However, the bandit troops in the city fabricated rumors that their troops had reached the city of Hefei, and that more than thirty feet of the south gate of Hefei had collapsed, and that the National Army in Hefei had withdrawn, making the common people confused and not knowing when they would see the light of day again! Many wounded soldiers came down from Taoxi Town, and only then did they know that the bandit troops had suffered a loss, and they were secretly happy.

Meeting an officer of the Shucheng Protection Brigade, who had assisted the National Army in the battle, he said that there were more than 5,000 bandit troops in Shucheng, but their equipment was very bad, especially lacking ammunition. It was a pity that the local military force was too poor. The police team had a cannon, but it could not fire even after thirteen rounds. The fourteenth round was fired half a mile away, but it did not explode, and many rifles did not have bayonets. The urgent need to strengthen the local military force can be said to be an obvious fact.

Now, the XXX Division headquarters is stationed in Shucheng. The reporter visited Division Commander Zhang Shiguang for the third time. Because both were limited in time, they only had a ten-minute conversation. He told the reporter that he had fought with Liu Bocheng's troops in southern Henan and was now fighting in central Anhui. Liu Bocheng had been fleeing for thousands of miles and was already exhausted, but its main force still had remnants. We must search for its main force and annihilate it. It does not attack fortifications, to make it encounter fortifications, with no road to escape. Division Commander Zhang is from Pingjiang, Hunan, and he knows many friends in the press.

On the Shuhe Highway, from Southern Henan to Shucheng, the highway and electric wires were mostly destroyed, but the Highway Bureau and the Hefei Electric Power Bureau of the Ministry of Communications quickly repaired them, which greatly helped the military progress. (Reporter Shi Baiping)

### Liao Qiujie, Director of the Beijing Salt Affairs Administration, Inspects the Yuyao Salt Field, Says Salt Price Too Low, Should Be Increased, Assault Incident to Be Resolved by Judicial Means

[Our dispatch from Hangzhou on the 27th] The Yuyao Andong League Field Administration in Zhejiang forced the league members to submit their salt to the warehouse for inspection, causing salt farmers to be injured in the beating, arousing public anger. Liao Qiujie, Director of the Beijing Salt Affairs Administration, specially went to inspect it and returned to Beijing this morning. It is said that the current salt price is 28,000 per load, which is indeed too low and should be increased. As for the two-thirds salt loan, the salt field owes more than 5 billion, but during the slack sales season, the salt field's capital turnover is not working, which is a factual difficulty. When the peak sales season comes, this matter can be resolved. In order to facilitate the salt farmers in the meantime, funds will be raised to pay a portion of the loan after returning to Beijing. It is illegal for league members to refuse to hand in salt and should immediately restore salt handing to the warehouse. The assault incident has been sent to the judicial authorities for resolution.

### Bankruptcy of Thousands, Losses of Hundreds of Billions: Tragic Fighting in Guangji, Rumored to Be Related to Last Year's Election

[Our dispatch from Hankou on the 27th] A tragic case of fighting has occurred in Guangji again. Residents surnamed Zhou in the area gathered surnames Wei, Zhang, and Zhu on the 14th and 18th of this month to provoke Liu and Song, resulting in an unprecedented fight. Both sides were equipped with weapons such as light machine guns and rifles. The war

Captains and below were assigned to various counties and cities in the name of instructors and clerks for practical training. Only 350 officers were actually employed within a few months, and their monthly income did not exceed 400,000 yuan, which led to a petition to Chairman Deng on the 2nd of this month. Team leader Cheng Jiong made a special trip to Chengdu to solve this problem. It is reported that the central government has concrete measures, and a clear order can be issued as soon as the other five inspection team leaders return to Nanjing from all over the country.

### Fuzhou Couple Commits Suicide by Jumping Off a Cliff: One Dead, One Injured

[Our dispatch from Fuzhou on the 22nd] Hou Mingyu, from Puli Township, Linsen County, had known Ma Qiuchen, a woman from the same township, for a long time, and the two were deeply in love. After graduating from Linsen County High School last year, Hou went to Shanghai, and he and Ma had been separated for many years. The woman's father has now betrothed her to Qiu Jingguan, the son of Qiu Desan in Yuanyang Village. Qiuchen strongly opposed her father's decision because she and Hou had privately made a marriage agreement. Father and daughter often quarreled. The day before yesterday, Hou Mingyu heard the news and returned from Shanghai, and also learned that Ma's wedding was imminent. He then made an appointment with the woman to temporarily climb Gushan, a famous scenic spot in Fuzhou, and stayed at Mingyue Building. They confided in each other and neither side wanted to break the agreement. However, the environment was such that it was difficult to fulfill their wishes. They then developed a thought of厭世. The day before yesterday, in the清晨 morning, Hou and the woman together climbed the Gushan Peak, looked down at the wide area, and then jumped off the cliff together to end their troubles. The woman was too weak and jumped to the waist of the cliff, hanging on a tree with injuries to her hands and feet, screaming for help. Hou fell straight down the cliff, his head was broken and bloody, and he died immediately. The villagers at the foot of the peak heard the screams and rushed to rescue her. The woman's injuries were not life-threatening. After this incident, Shigu was in an uproar.
