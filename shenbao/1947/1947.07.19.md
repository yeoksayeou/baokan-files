Zhang Qun Attends Meeting to Explain the Significance of Mobilization

[This newspaper, Nanjing, 18th] The "Outline for Implementing Constitutional Government Upon Completion of the Suppression of Rebellion" was submitted for discussion at the State Council meeting on the 18th. Premier Zhang Qun of the Executive Yuan first explained the original proposal, stating: Since receiving the instruction to vigorously implement national mobilization to realize the policy of peaceful nation-building, the Executive Yuan has immediately followed the order to instruct its subordinates, explaining the significance of mobilization, supervising its thorough implementation, and repeatedly studying and formulating the eighteen articles of the implementation outline. The main spirit is to strengthen the mobilization of manpower and material resources to quickly suppress the Communist bandits' rebellion, eliminate obstacles to democracy, and continue to strive to refresh local politics, improve people's lives, and effectively protect the basic interests of the people. All soldiers, civilians, officials at all levels, and even friends from all nations should be clearly aware that the government's mobilization to suppress the rebellion is not only a passive strengthening of the military to suppress bandits, but also an active acceleration of national work. Suppressing the rebellion aims to achieve unity, and suppressing the bandits does not affect the implementation of constitutional government. Only by concentrating strength can the Communist bandits be quickly suppressed, peaceful nation-building be achieved, and the goal be reached as soon as possible. After Zhang Qun's report, many committee members expressed their opinions and proposed amendments, especially regarding Article 17, "Except as otherwise provided in this outline, the Executive Yuan may, in accordance with the provisions of the National General Mobilization Law, issue necessary orders at any time in order to achieve the purpose of suppressing the rebellion." Because this implementation outline only pertains to certain parts and not the whole, there are many matters outside of what is specified in this outline, making it impossible to issue orders at any time. Another opinion was that this part of the outline is based on the General Mobilization Law, and it is not necessary to repeat the General Mobilization Law in this clause. After much discussion, Chairman Chiang stood up and said: This article can be explained, that is, if the Premier of the Executive Yuan needs to issue orders, it must be approved by the State Council meeting or submitted for a report to be approved. If it is not approved, it cannot be implemented. It was then approved by unanimous agreement of all committee members.

Wang Shijie and Bai Chongxi Report on Diplomacy and Military Affairs

[This newspaper, Nanjing, 18th] Wang Shijie and Bai Chongxi presented reports on diplomatic and military affairs, respectively, at the State Council meeting on the 18th. The diplomatic part included two points: the peace treaty with Japan and the visit of Special Envoy Wedemeyer to China. Regarding the establishment of the peace treaty with Japan, the drafting of the preliminary draft, and the location and time of the peace conference, Wang said: The United States advocates that eleven countries participate in the peace treaty with Japan, and we should agree and decide to participate. The issue of veto power at the meeting has been decided to adopt a majority rule. Wang also explained Wedemeyer's mission to China. The military report indicated that the Communist army in the Northeast is relatively strong due to international assistance, but its main force has been cut off by the government army. At the same time, many areas have been affected by severe flooding, cutting off many routes, so the current war situation has seen little progress on either side. Secondly, the Communist army in Shandong has the potential to converge towards the Jinpu Railway Line and western Henan, and we are closely guarding against this. After the report, many government committee members raised inquiries, which Wang and Bai answered separately.

[This newspaper, Nanjing, 18th] The proposal to cancel the reserved quotas for Communist Party National Representatives and State Council members and to remove current Communist Party councilors was reported at the State Council meeting on the 18th. All committee members unanimously agreed that there were no objections. This action is a demonstration of the government's attitude after the promulgation of the General Mobilization Law to strengthen the suppression of the Communist army. According to Article 10 of the National Government Organization Law: "The National Government shall establish a committee limited to 40 members, selected and appointed by the Chairman of the National Government from within and outside the Kuomintang," which does not specify the number of Communist Party members nor does it have explicit provisions for reserving quotas for the Communist Party. There are currently 29 committee members, which is within the limit of 40 and therefore legal. At the same time, the majority believed that this number did not need to be supplemented, as 29 members were sufficient for the statutory number, and some believed that future elections should no longer reserve quotas for the Communist Party.

### Ningxia Province Has Strong Military Force; Communist Army's Ambitions Will Not Be Fulfilled

Ma Hongda Talks to Our Reporter

[This newspaper, Nanjing, 18th] Ma Hongda, Chairman of Ningxia Province, met with our reporter on the morning of the 18th. Ma said: He came to Nanjing to report on his duties upon the summons of the authorities because Chairman Chiang expressed particular concern about the Communist army's disturbances in the border area of northern Shaanxi. When he met with the Chairman on the 17th, he gave a detailed report on the local situation and is now awaiting instructions. The reporter then inquired about the military strength of Ningxia Province. Ma said that the local people in Ningxia Province have a good foundation in training and are sufficient to defend against the enemy. However, the Communist army's arbitrary disturbances after the victory are a cause for concern. This time, the Peng Dehuai unit of the bandit army fully disturbed the Ningxia border, with the intention of invading Ningxia Province. However, it can be asserted that even with great force, the Communist army cannot achieve its ambition to enter Ningxia because our local military force is well-trained and has a strong united force. As a result of this battle, we have eliminated three and a half regiments of the Communist army's forces, and the Iron Eighth Regiment, which they call their strongest, has also been completely annihilated. Secondly, Ma also talked about economic and educational aspects. Regarding education, there are many primary schools, but only three normal schools in the province. We will try to increase the number in the future. In terms of economy, there are several factories for handicrafts and light industry. Generally speaking, we can be self-sufficient. Ma came to Nanjing in 1936, and this is his first visit after eleven years. He highly praised the construction of the capital.

After Chen Cheng arrives, he will have important talks with the authorities in North China and Northeast China that evening.

[This newspaper, Tianjin, 18th] Shangguan Yunxiang, Deputy Director of the Bao Sui Department, Tianjin Mayor Du Jianshi, Garrison Commander Lin Weizhu, and Deputy Commander Pang Jiqing took a special train to Ping on the 18th to meet with Chief of Staff Chen. Chen's trip to Tianjin has been canceled.

[This newspaper, Beiping, 18th] Liu Duoquan, Chairman of Rehe Province, came to Ping by train via the Pinggu Line from Chengde on the 18th to meet with Chief of Staff Chen. Also, Lu Zhonglin and others of the Military慰劳团 returned to Ping from Baoding on the 18th.

[This newspaper, Shenyang, 18th] Chief of Staff Chen Cheng said at a press conference on the morning of the 18th: The people of the Northeast are eager to love the country, and there are young people and the masses, which is the best area for implementing the Three Principles of the People. During my week in the Northeast, I felt that each unit needs to do more self-examination. At present, there is too much forgiveness for oneself and too much criticism of others, forming a phenomenon of resentment against heaven and others. Suppressing bandits is a matter of strengthening the country, and a mobilization order has now been officially issued, which can also be called a punitive expedition order. If the bandits are truly suppressed, it is expected to succeed in three months, but due to international constraints, there may be delays. This is due to our own lack of ambition and effort. There is no distinction between inside and outside the pass, only a distinction between first and last. The interior is focusing on destroying the Communist army. The military center of Shandong and the political center of Shaanxi and Shanxi have turned into a favorable situation. The conscription in the Northeast will be supplemented soon. Everyone is wary of the Communist army's sixth comeback, which is a good phenomenon. Everyone is unwilling to be a slave to a lost country and does not want a third world war, nor do they want to treat the Soviet Union as an enemy. He also said: I originally planned to stay in the Northeast for two weeks, but I was ordered to return urgently. I will fly to Ping at 3 p.m. on the 18th and then return to Beijing.

### Responsible Authorities Inquire About the Truth of the Mongolian Army's Invasion of Suiyuan; Fu Zuoyi Will Go to Beijing in the Short Term to Ask for Instructions

[This newspaper, Nanjing, 18th] The official has not yet confirmed the news that the Outer Mongolian army invaded the northeastern part of Suiyuan along the Zhangjiakou-Kulan Avenue. However, according to sources from related parties, in order to avoid the concerns of Outer Mongolia and the Soviet Union, we have not stationed strong troops on the long and desolate border line in the northern part of Chahar and Suiyuan, so it is very likely that the Mongolian army entered directly. The responsible authorities attach great importance to this and have telegraphed Chief of Staff Fu Zuoyi and Chairman Dong Qiwu to inquire about the truth. If it is true, they should quickly collect evidence and report it for negotiation. According to news from related parties: Because the Mongolian side had border issues with us from time to time, General Fu Zuoyi may come to Beijing in the short term to pay respects to the authorities and ask for instructions in order to fulfill the important responsibility of defending the border.

III. Work Items

The crops for increase production are rice, wheat, corn, sorghum, millet, sweet potato, potato, vegetables, and soybeans, nine kinds in total.

### Continued Collection and Borrowing of Goods This Year; Proposal by Zhang Qun and Others Approved by the State Council; To Be Submitted to the Executive Yuan for Proper Drafting of a Plan for Swift Implementation

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 18th Dispatch] The case of continuing to collect and borrow goods this year to fill the military, has been approved at the State Council meeting on the 18th. The case was proposed by Zhang Qun, Wang Yunwu, and Weng Wenhao, and its three principles are as follows: (1) The collection of goods will be handled by the Ministry of Food according to the original plan, and the quota collection rate will remain unchanged. The provinces and counties should receive 70%, all of which will be purchased by the central government; (2) The borrowing will be carried out according to the original allocation borrowing amount determined by the Ministry of Food; (3) In areas with disaster-caused crop failures or insufficient collection and borrowing, additional purchases will be made to make up for the shortfall. According to this proposal, it is to cooperate with the mobilization to quell the rebellion. In the situation of enriching the first-line corps and establishing the second-line corps, the military food demand will inevitably increase. If calculated at 4.5 million people, the annual demand is 40.5 million dan. The Ministry of Food's original plan was to collect more than 20.8 million shi this year, which is only half of the required military food. Therefore, in order to seek sufficient food and soldiers, in addition to the collection of goods, borrowing, purchasing, and buying foreign wheat should also be carried out to meet the required amount. After the case is passed, it will be submitted to the Executive Yuan for proper drafting of a plan for swift implementation.

### Urban Economic Control Program Divided into Three Major Sectors

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 18th Dispatch] The "Draft Urban Economic Control Program" drafted by the Executive Yuan was discussed at the National Economic Commission on the 17th.

It is learned that the original case, except for the cotton yarn sector, is roughly similar to the Economic Emergency Measures. The implementation area is the 32 negotiated price areas designated by the Economic Emergency Measures Program. The content of the case is divided into three major sectors: first, the control of six major categories of important materials such as food, fuel, daily necessities, salt, cotton yarn, and sugar. Second, the control of the financial industry, divided into ten items: (1) supervision of the use of bank funds, (2) management of remittance circulation, (3) supervision of the legal circulation of bills, (4) credit control, (5) interest rate control, (6) guidance of speculative funds in legitimate activities, (7) crackdown on speculative trading, (8) strengthening of bank inspections, correction of illegal acts of banks and illegal acts of responsible persons and employees, crackdown on underground banks, (9) crackdown on smuggling activities, (10) strengthening of industry association organizations. Third, the control of wages.

### Ministry of Finance Intensifies Collection of This Year's Income Tax

Deadline Set for End of August

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 18th Dispatch] In order to implement the Economic Emergency Measures Program and strengthen the collection of business income tax, the Ministry of Finance previously stipulated that taxpayers should declare their income before April 15th, pay in advance, and then conduct investigations to verify the tax amount. However, the Chambers of Commerce in various places have repeatedly delayed the process by obstructing the inspection of accounts. In order to take into account the business community and accelerate the tax payment procedures, the Ministry has reduced the number of accounting units and expanded the scope of standard taxation. Recently, the highest authorities have reported that the profit tax of business enterprises this year has been overdue in many places. In order to meet the needs of general mobilization, they have specifically instructed Minister Yu of the Ministry of Finance to strictly limit the collection to the treasury by the end of August. The Ministry of Finance has telegraphed various direct tax bureaus and Chambers of Commerce in various places to intensify collection from now on, with the end of August as the final deadline.

### Convening of Preliminary Meeting on the Japanese Peace Treaty; We Decided to Agree in Principle; Dutch Government Announces Acceptance of Invitation

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 18th Dispatch] It is learned that after we received the invitation from the United States to convene a preliminary meeting on the Japanese peace treaty, we have decided to agree in principle. As for whether the Soviet Union agrees, it was not considered on our behalf. A certain authoritative person has stated that we are willing to make efforts to promote the successful convening of this meeting, but if in the end only ten countries participate, it would be a pity. Our opinion on the peace treaty will be in the form of itemized lists, with specific and detailed content, and will be drafted in the short term.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 18th Dispatch] The United States invited a country from the Far Eastern Commission to convene a preliminary meeting on the Japanese peace treaty on August 19th.

### Secretary-General of the Far Eastern Commission Jenson Issues Report

[Central News Agency, Washington, 17th Dispatch] Secretary-General Jenson of the Far Eastern Commission issued a lengthy report today, reporting on the activities of the eleven member states from February 26, 1946 to July 10, 1947. Jenson stated that the Commission's dual objectives are as follows: One is to formulate policy principles and standards so that Japan can fulfill its surrender conditions accordingly. One is to study any instructions issued and any actions taken by MacArthur at the request of any member state.

Jenson explained that the Far Eastern Commission does not make any recommendations on military action and territorial adjustments. The term of office of the Commission has not been determined, but once it is decided that the Commission will cease to exercise its powers, the Commission will immediately cease to exercise its powers. The Meiji Constitution of 1889, although seemingly disguised as freedom, was in fact an extremely undemocratic constitution, and at the same time had a great impact on the maintenance of the basic feudal organization of the Japanese people. During the period of military aggression, the constitution was used as a tool, and Japanese militarists and extreme nationalists were able to gain political power and exercise their power. The Commission believes that the preservation of the academic system is not entirely desirable, and we should encourage the Japanese people to reform the academic system in a more democratic direction. The report also reviewed the various achievements of the Council, such as the policies of the Japanese surrender, the issue of compensation, economic leisure, democratic tendencies, crime issues, and disarmament issues, and emphasized the implementation of the Potsdam Declaration clauses governing Japan's post-war status.

### Time Limit for Applying for the Return of Robbed Machinery Should Not Be Specified

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs Intervenes with the Allied Headquarters

[Central News Agency, Taipei, 18th Dispatch] I have just learned from the Taiwan Provincial Government that our Ministry of Foreign Affairs has raised objections to MacArthur's Headquarters' deadline for applying for the return of robbed machinery. The person in charge of MacArthur's Headquarters once stated: "The machinery robbed by the Japanese in the past is limited to applying for return before July of this year. If the time limit is exceeded, it will be transferred to compensation items." The Ministry of Foreign Affairs believes that there is no basis for this deadline in the resolution of the Far Eastern Commission, and the Japanese people generally conceal and do not report the items they have robbed, and it takes a lot of time for our country to investigate. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has telegraphed Ambassador Gu Weijun, requesting the US government to instruct MacArthur's Headquarters not to set a deadline. At the same time, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs ordered our delegation in Japan to strive nearby to cancel the deadline so that we can apply for the return of robbed items by the Japanese in China at any time.

### Northern Jiangsu Increases the Number of Security Teams; The Security Regiments in the Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Districts Decided to Change Their Names

[Our Newspaper, Nantong, 18th Dispatch] The First Pacification Area Headquarters previously strengthened the local self-defense forces in northern Jiangsu, and with the approval of the Army Headquarters, ordered the Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Administrative Regions to organize security regiments.

### Mop-Up Operation in Sanbei, Eastern Zhejiang, Initially Completed

Remnant Bandits Retreat into Siming Mountain in Separate Groups

[Our Newspaper, Hangzhou, 18th Dispatch] More than 200 bandits from northern Jiangsu and another 50 bandits landed in Sanbei, eastern Zhejiang, and disturbed the local area, obstructed government orders, robbed civilian ships, established a coastal defense team, and recruited unemployed youths.

Currently, there are no bandits in Sanbei, only lurking along the coast, intimidating towns and villages. Therefore, the future strategy is how to prevent the landing of bandits again. Chairman Shen has made overall plans for defense based on the terrain of eastern Zhejiang.

### Early Compensation for Demolition and Relocation Materials: First Appropriation of 100 Billion

### Editorial: A Comprehensive Review of Economic Laws and Regulations!

—The Key to the Success or Failure of the General Mobilization Plan—

The Outline for the Implementation of Constitutional Government through Mobilization to Suppress Rebellion, consisting of eighteen articles, was submitted by the Executive Yuan to the State Council yesterday morning, passed, and promulgated for implementation. Among them, the ones related to the economy are Articles 4, 5, 6, 10, 11, and 12, which can be categorized by nature as follows: (1) regulations for requisition and expropriation, (2) sanctions against hoarding and speculation, (3) maintenance of production and social order, (4) control of daily necessities, finance, trade, and wages, (5) assistance and construction for production and transportation enterprises, and (6) regulation of national revenue and expenditure. All departments related to finance, currency, prices, wages, trade, production, and transportation are included; moreover, in addition to passive control, it also covers active assistance and construction. In terms of economic administration, this is undoubtedly a major measure.

Article 15 of the original draft states that if detailed regulations need to be formulated separately, the relevant ministries of the Executive Yuan shall draft the measures and submit them to the Executive Yuan for approval, which shall be promulgated and implemented by order. The above articles are, of course, broad outlines, merely stipulating a framework and principles. As for how to implement these principles within this framework, it remains for the relevant ministries to formulate, and what we believe is worthy of attention and discussion are these implementation measures.

In fact, except for requisition and expropriation, which need to be decided according to the mobilization situation, the other items are not without ready-made methods. For example, in the Economic Emergency Measures Plan, the "Measures for Prohibiting Hoarding and Speculation of Important Daily Necessities in Extraordinary Times" has been restored in connection with the item of hoarding and speculation; for the control of daily necessities, the "Detailed Rules for the Implementation of Measures for the Supply of Daily Necessities" have been formulated; for the regulation and management of various production enterprises, the "Regulations for the Management of Agriculture, Mining, Industry, and Commerce in Extraordinary Times" have been restored; and for the two items of prices and wages, there are "Regulations for Prohibiting Violations of Price Limits and Price Negotiations" and "Measures for Evaluating Wages" to follow. The financial and fiscal items also have clear provisions in the Emergency Measures Plan. In addition, the implementation of production loans, the organization of farmland irrigation, and various newly established regulations can be seen at any time. Moreover, in addition to the laws and regulations promulgated by the central government, local governments have at any time and place formulated numerous measures regarding prohibiting price gouging, speculation and manipulation, and prohibiting outbound and transit trade.

Currently, various central laws and local regulations have not been expressly abolished. Now, with the mobilization to suppress rebellion and the separate enactment of an implementation outline, will a new stove be started, and a new set of rules be formulated? Or will the old rules be followed, and the current laws and regulations continue to be used? Or will more additions and supplements be made to strengthen their effectiveness? At present, these are all unknowns, but in order to support the suppression of rebellion and promote mobilization, we must hope that the authorities will thoroughly consider and reorganize these laws and regulations. Because today's economic crisis in our country, how to overcome it, is no longer a question of whether there are laws and regulations, but a question of whether the laws and regulations are too complicated and whether the execution is effective.

Generally speaking, the results of the implementation of these laws and regulations in the past have to be said to be failures or disappointments. Look at the prohibition of hoarding and the prohibition of prices in various places, which are not based on these laws and regulations? But in fact, the hoarding trend is becoming more intense, and the price increase trend is becoming more rampant, in direct proportion to the number of laws and regulations. This is obvious to everyone. For example, national banks have spared no effort to lend hundreds of billions of dollars to promote production, assist exports, and assist farmers, and the state has specially set up several institutions to promote these assistance efforts, but industry and commerce seem to be increasingly declining, and the countryside is becoming more and more collapsed. Exported goods have already risen too high before they are exported, and export trade is still forced to a standstill. It can be seen that these assistances, at least in fact, did not hit the key points and achieve the expected results. As for the mediation of labor and capital, the strict prohibition of strikes, work stoppages, shutdowns, and other behaviors that hinder production and social order, the authorities have long emphasized it repeatedly, but unfortunately, the speakers are sincere, and the listeners are indifferent. To this day, labor disputes that do not listen to mediation and do not accept arbitration still occur one after another. This cannot be said to be a lack of laws and regulations. In fact, from the perspective of some people, it seems that laws and regulations are one thing, and actual actions are another. The people's psychology and the government's expectations have become divergent, so that many actions have gone off track, and countless laws and regulations have become mere formalities! This is the biggest problem in today's economic issues and the biggest difficulty that should be overcome when implementing general mobilization!

How should these difficulties be overcome? First, it should naturally start with personnel, and second, it should also start with the laws and regulations themselves. Let's put aside the personnel issue for now and focus on the legal issue.

The biggest problem with the current various economic laws and regulations is that there are too many and too chaotic, the second is that they are too strict and unreasonable, and the third is that they are too rash and fluid, making people think that they change every day.

Let's give a few examples to prove it. Taking the suppression of rice and grain as an example: the Regulations on Prohibiting Violations of Price Limits and Price Negotiations can be applied, the Measures for Prohibiting Hoarding and Speculation can be applied, the Regulations on the Management of Agriculture, Industry, Commerce and Mining can be applied, and of course, the Provisional Regulations on Punishing Crimes Against Food Administration can also be applied. Since there are so many laws and regulations, and the degree of leniency and strictness varies greatly, the most severe can be applied to military law. If you want to be lenient, you might as well use administrative sanctions. For the same case, if one part is subject to administrative sanctions, another part must be transferred to the judiciary. Such complexity makes the parties confused, and the case handlers have to go to great lengths. As a result, people who break the law cannot help but try to escape the law. This is an example of too much and too chaos.

Take hoarding and speculation as another example, in addition to the various local penalties, Article 3 of the "Detailed Rules for the Implementation of Measures for the Supply of Daily Necessities" stipulates that those who make use of their occupation or other special relations to purchase and store daily necessities in large quantities with the intention of monopolizing or raising prices shall be punished according to the law. So, literally, those who do not purchase and store in large quantities should naturally not be in violation of the law. But what is the number that constitutes a large amount of purchase and storage? The law has no clear provisions. It also states: Storing items and not selling them on the market, but raising prices beyond legal profits, is an act of speculation. The legal profit in the preceding paragraph shall be determined by the competent authorities at any time, taking into account local conditions. (Article 4) According to this article, if the price increase does not exceed the legal profit, or even if it exceeds it, the competent authorities have not determined the legal profit for these many items at any time, should it be considered an act of speculation? Should it be punished? This also seems to be a question. According to Articles 9, 13, and 15 of the law, anyone who produces, purchases, stores, or sells such items must register or report to the trade association each time or periodically. In addition to reporting to the authorities in accordance with the law, the association must also check and correct them at any time. The procedures are so trivial. Taking the situation in Shanghai as an example, can it actually be done? Does the competent authority have so many personnel to review, inspect, and correct them? If there is no effort to review, inspect, and correct, and everything is filed away and put on the shelf, what is the point of asking businessmen to go through so many procedures?

On February 6 of this year, the export subsidy system was implemented, but it was cancelled when the Economic Emergency Measures Plan was promulgated on February 17. The Ministry of Finance formulated the "Measures for Handling Gold Ornaments for Silver Shops and Jewelry Stores" on February 20, but due to too many conflicts, it formulated the "Measures for the Management of Silver Shops' Acceptance and Manufacture of Gold Ornaments" on March 23. Other examples include the sudden tightening and loosening of the inland transportation of yarn and cloth, the sudden suspension of subsidies for public utilities, the sudden permission and rejection of foreign exchange purchases of foreign goods, and the sudden freezing and unfreezing of the cost of living index. The effective period of persistence is mostly only two or three months, and less than four or five days. Although the authorities have to adapt to the situation due to the too strong price fluctuations and the too rapid changes in the situation, it still gives people the feeling that the orders are changed every day. The damage to the people's psychology of abiding by the law and the authority of national laws is really not small. These are all examples of being too rash in legislation.

Therefore, we advocate that if you want to control to take effect and mobilization to take effect, then these laws and regulations really need to be thoroughly reviewed and reorganized. All contradictory, redundant, and unreasonable parts must be deleted, merged, and simplified quickly, so that the context is clear, neat, and uniform. Then, the people who execute the laws and regulations and abide by the laws and regulations will be clear at a glance, and there will be no trouble of being caught in a hurry. Although Emperor Gaozu of Han's three-chapter law may not be applicable to today, the simplicity and clarity of economic laws and regulations is really undeniable. If a new stove has to be started and re-established, then these restrictive laws and regulations are best to be completely destroyed and cleared, and explicitly abolished. Do not stack them on top of each other like piled firewood, more and more, so that good citizens who abide by the law are in danger of violating the ban everywhere, and unscrupulous officials can take advantage of these complexities and contradictions to manipulate and make profits. This is the key to the turning point of economic control and the key to the success or failure of the general mobilization plan, which we believe is worthy of attention.

### The United States Should Strengthen Its Position in Greece To Prevent Soviet Influence From Extending: Chairman of the US House Foreign Affairs Committee Expresses

[Reported by our newspaper] San Francisco, 19th Radio: Regarding the US actions in Greece to counter the Soviet Union, in addition to Marshal's expression, Chairman Eden of the US House Foreign Affairs Committee also made a frank statement in the House meeting today. He expressed extreme indignation at the Polish representative's request in the Security Council for the withdrawal of US military forces from Greece. It is said: "The United States must maintain its position in Greece, otherwise the Soviet Union will take the opportunity to invade, and if so, the fate of the Balkans will be in danger."

Further news: Greek planes strafed retreating guerrillas today.

[Reuters, Athens, 17th] It is learned that after the counterattack by the government forces in northern Greece, the guerrillas retreating to the Albanian border have begun to engage in strong new positions. Government forces are currently carrying out mopping-up operations in mountainous areas 3,000 feet above sea level. According to Greek Public Security Minister Chairvales, the attacking teams that invaded Greece consist of eight battalions, each with approximately 300 people, all equipped very well. These eight battalions simultaneously crossed the border at three points, of which two battalions belong to foreign-organized troops, and one battalion is a Tito unit. Two battalions advanced towards Ko Niza after invading, and the remaining six battalions advanced towards Je Nina, the capital of Epirus Province. The Albanian border was originally undefended. After Je Nina City issued a warning, it sent some police and army liaison teams to meet the enemy and surrounded the enemy in Mount Kala Yi, but they relied on the terrain to escape.

[French News Agency, Athens, 17th] The Greek Cabinet decided at its meeting today to instruct Cabinet Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Tsaldaris, who is currently in the United States, to stay in Washington to continue negotiations with the United States on aid to Greece. On the other hand, it was decided to order Interior Minister Papandreou to cancel his trip to the United States and return directly to his country.

[French News Agency, Yugoslav Capital, 17th] Rumors that an "international military brigade" has been formed in Yugoslavia to interfere in the Greek civil war have been denied by the Yugoslav government in a statement. It also said that this news is intended to deceive world public opinion and provide an excuse for foreign interference in Greece's internal affairs. According to this news, which was transmitted by the Greek side and published by several foreign news agencies and newspapers, it was specifically pointed out that a senior Yugoslav military officer is involved in this "international military brigade."

### "Free Communist Party" Propaganda Group – A "Free" Government in Greece?

[Associated Press, Athens, 17th] It is learned today that a "Free Communist Party" state is about to be declared in northern Greece, with its government potentially located in the Grammos Mountains near the Albanian border. According to the official newspaper of the National Liberation Front, controlled by the Communist Party, a guerrilla radio station will broadcast a statement by leader Vifiadis, arguing that it is absolutely necessary to establish an independent Communist government in the "liberated areas" of northern Greece "to prevent Greece from being subjected to foreign interference and becoming a flashpoint for Balkan wars." A high-ranking official in Allied diplomatic circles stated that the declaration of a Communist government may benefit the governments of various Soviet satellite states, allowing them to formally recognize the guerrillas and provide open assistance. According to Communist newspaper reports, the radio station was founded by the "Greek Democratic Army" headquarters and broadcasts for two hours daily. The Foreign Ministry stated that the guerrilla radio station has been broadcasting for two days, but its location is not within Greece, likely in Bulgaria or the capital of Yugoslavia.

### Opposition to Establishing a Balkan Border Commission – The Soviet Union Intends to Use Its Veto – Two Vassal States Wave the Flag in Support

[Report from this newspaper] San Francisco, 19th (broadcast): According to a Bulgarian official, the Soviet Union is determined to use its veto to oppose the United States' proposal for a United Nations border commission to police the Balkans. The official requested that his name not be disclosed.

[Central News Agency, Chenggong Lake, 17th] Although the United States seeks to quickly resolve the Balkan issue in the Security Council, Balkan Soviet vassal states and their supporters have clearly decided to delay the matter. During today's continuation of the Security Council's discussion on the Greek issue, representatives from Poland and Czechoslovakia delivered lengthy speeches defending Greece's three northern neighbors: Albania, Bulgaria, and Yugoslavia. Several other representatives also engaged in lengthy and fruitless debates. At the same time, Soviet representative Andrei Gromyko launched another strong offensive, opposing the US proposal to establish a semi-permanent Balkan commission. Gromyko delivered a 45-minute speech in harsh Russian, arguing that the aforementioned proposal violated the UN Charter and reality. He stated that if the Security Council accepted the US proposal, it would mean the Security Council was deciding to violate the UN Charter.

### The Greek Situation – Turkey Feels Anxious

Furthermore, qualified observers have stated that Turkey is quite concerned about the events occurring on Greece's western border. Turkey will witness the formation of a Slavic-controlled government in northern Greece, whose influence may extend to the Turkish border. Such a situation would allow the Soviet Union to control the Dardanelles Strait.

[United Press, Yogyakarta, 18th] Indonesian Prime Minister Sjahrir stated in a broadcast that the Republic has reached the limit of its concessions. A peaceful resolution of the Indonesian issue is not only related to Dutch interests but also to the interests of the entire world. "Dutch-Indonesian negotiations have now reached a deadlock. We understand what this means." Sjahrir stated that the Indonesian people can trust that the Dutch will not resort to final threats within the scope of peace. Sjahrir stated that he understands that the Dutch do not intend to use force, as the ultimatum stated in their declaration has already passed.

[Central News Agency, Batavia, 18th] Qualified Dutch sources stated after the Indonesian Republic responded to the Dutch final proposal that the situation is not as bad as generally imagined. The Dutch and Indonesian governments may send official delegations to Yogyakarta to discuss with the Indonesian Republic again to eliminate the current difficulties.

Indonesia Awaits Dutch Response

[Agence France-Presse, Batavia, 18th] The Indonesian government submitted a note to Dutch East Indies Governor-General Van Mook yesterday afternoon and is now awaiting his response. People here are mostly worried. Observers believe that if the Indonesian side wants to prevent armed conflict, it can only appeal to the United Nations or the International Court of Justice for arbitration, or ask a third country to mediate. It is reported that Indonesian Prime Minister Sjahrir met with the US and British consuls-general in Batavia yesterday.

[Agence France-Presse, Batavia, 17th] After arriving here, the Indonesian Minister of Justice immediately visited Van Mook and handed him two notes: (1) Indonesia requests the organization of a domestic security guidance committee under the guidance of the Indonesian Provisional Government, composed of Dutch authorities and representatives of various states; (2) Stop all preparations aimed at resolving the Indonesian issue by force and order the immediate cessation of similar war activities by the army, navy, and air force.

The Indonesian Central Labor Organization met in Yogyakarta and called on workers around the world to boycott Dutch goods if the Netherlands attacks Indonesian troops with 100,000 naval, land, and air forces. A Dutch headquarters communiqué stated that Indonesian troops have committed destruction for the 1,000th time since the ceasefire agreement in October of last year.

### Latent Crisis of Civil War in Italy – The Communist Party Spares No Effort in Criticizing the Government – US Export-Import Bank Loans Italy $100 Million

[Reuters, Rome, 17th] Italian Communist Party Chairman Togliatti stated in his address to the party's executive committee that the Gasperi government is laying the groundwork for civil war. He said that the enemies of the working class are doing their best to provoke workers and using the police to deal with labor leaders. Even if this is not intentional preparation for civil war, it is enough to cause a civil war. There are two purposes: one is to weaken the Communist Party's strength, and the other is to cut off the Communist Party's contact with other democratic parties. Our purpose is to consolidate and expand democratic forces, while our enemies' purpose is the opposite. We, the left-wing parties, must intensify our work to undermine the right-wing government. Italian political figures generally believe that since the Gasperi government took office a month ago, the domestic situation has become increasingly unstable. The current situation is very similar to the eve of the Fascist takeover, which makes those who care about national affairs deeply worried.

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 17th] Regarding the US loan to Italy, US Export-Import Bank officials were sent to Italy to study the country's economic situation. After several months, they returned here today. The Export-Import Bank immediately decided to allocate $100 million in loans to Italy. This loan was decided after Italian Prime Minister Gasperi visited the United States and held consultations with the US government.

### People in Thirteen Provinces of Korea Express – Willingness to Cooperate Sincerely with the United States – And Say that Opposition to Trusteeship Is Not Anti-American

[Central News Agency, Washington, 17th] President Truman today received a joint letter from representatives of thirteen provinces of Korea (including provinces in the Soviet-occupied zone), guaranteeing Korea's goodwill and sincere willingness to cooperate with the United States. This letter has been released by the Korean delegation here. It expresses opposition to the trusteeship plan for Korea, saying that it violates the principle of independence. At the same time, it declares support for the anti-communist movement.

[United Press, Washington, 17th] The Korean Commission distributed to newspapers here on the 17th the telegram from the Korean People's Congress in Seoul (an informal national congress) to President Truman and the Senate and House of Representatives, stating that the Congress is fighting against the anti-American movement of the Communist Party, which disregards the United States' neutral policy. The telegram pointed out that the rumor that the Korean people oppose the presence of people in Korea is completely inaccurate and expresses regret for this rumor. The article also stated: "Our refusal to accept trusteeship should not be regarded as anti-American. We oppose trusteeship because this move violates independence, and also because we will not be able to prevent the spread of the Communist Party." The letter continued, stating that they are now planning to hold general elections to organize a provisional government representing the entire country. The Congress expressed its gratitude for the relief and recovery assistance being drafted by the United States, saying that this assistance is indeed extremely needed.

### Raising the Level of German Industrial Production – Britain and the United States Still Have Conflicting Opinions – Britain Has Not Yet Agreed to Participate in Washington Negotiations

[Reuters, London, 17th] A Foreign Office spokesperson stated that Britain has not yet expressed its acceptance of the US invitation to discuss Ruhr coal production in Washington. London generally believes that Britain has not expressed its acceptance because it hopes that the scope of the meeting can be expanded.

[United Press, Washington, 18th] Britain's suggestion that the United States bear the majority of the expenses in the British and American combined zones in Germany has been resolutely rejected by the United States. At the same time, the United States has rejected Britain's other plan to move the German coal production conference, which was originally scheduled to be held here next week, to Berlin. Regarding the new standards of German industrial planning, due to the differences between Britain and the United States, it is still at a standstill. US officials hope that all difficulties can be overcome soon. There are countless differences between Britain and the United States, some of which are related to the basic handling of German issues, and what is currently most troubling to Britain is that it must use a large amount of gold dollars in Germany. Since the merger of the two zones last December, the two governments have agreed to share all expenses equally. This has led Britain to hope that the United States can bear more of the burden, but the United States has not allowed it. The former US Secretary of State told British Foreign Secretary Bevin that if Britain is willing to exchange occupation zones, the United States can pay more for occupation fees. The US-occupied zone is the poorest zone in Germany, while the British-occupied zone is the most substantial in Germany, as it includes the wealthiest Ruhr industrial area. US officials replied to Britain that if Britain is willing to exchange occupation zones, the United States can pay more for occupation fees. As for the coal conference, it was originally announced on July 11th that Britain agreed to send a delegation to Washington for the meeting. Since then, Britain has wanted to expand the scope of the meeting to include the financial and food situation in the two zones, as well as other economic issues, but the United States has strictly refused. Although the United States is not opposed to discussing all economic issues with Britain, the United States currently believes that the coal issue is the most important. Before a way can be found to increase coal production, there is no time to consider other issues. Finally, Britain also agreed that only the coal issue will be discussed at the meeting.

### On the German Issue – France Reaffirms Its Position

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 17th] At today's meeting of the European Economic Cooperation Committee, the Dutch representative stated that all of Germany's untapped production potential should be utilized so that Germany's industrial productivity can be increased to the maximum extent. The French representative, the Director of Economic Affairs of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Alphonse, immediately stood up and replied that France will never allow the revival of German industry without sufficient security guarantees. The French government believes that the need for security is more important than the industrial revival of Germany, and we must continue to consider this in our future work.

### US Governors Conference – Supports the Marshall Plan

[Reuters, Salt Lake City, Utah, 17th] The 39th annual meeting of the governors of the 48 US states closed today, unanimously passing a resolution expressing support for the non-partisan US foreign policy aimed at establishing world peace. The resolution stated: "The foreign policy of the United States, beyond party, individual, or political motives, should always be a US foreign policy that represents the best policy of the United States, showing the world that the United States is a country seeking peace, and unanimously decided to safeguard the inalienable rights and interests enjoyed by US citizens." New York Governor Dewey later expressed the opinion that this resolution has made the nation's governors firmly support the government in completing world peace and will never be regarded as a proclamation of isolationism. In addition, the Governors' Conference resolved to ask Congress to enact legislation for universal military training for American youth.

### US Army Personnel

Reduced by Seven-Eighths Compared to Wartime

[United Press, Washington, 18th] The US Army Department revealed on the 18th that during wartime, the United States had 8 million soldiers, but this has now been reduced to 900,000 during peacetime, and the reduction is still continuing at a rate of 385 soldiers per day. According to the Army authorities, the current number of soldiers discharged each week is 7,000, while the number of new recruits who should be enlisted in the first week of July is only 4,318. July has always been one of the months with the best recruitment results in a year, so the number of troops decreases by at least 2,682 per week. The current number of US troops is already 80,000 less than the minimum amount set by the General Staff approved by the National Power Grid for carrying out global occupation responsibilities.

### Labor Unrest Sweeping France – 300,000 Artisans Prepare to Petition

[Reuters, Paris, 18th] Paris Central Post Office employees, protesting the National Federation of Civil Servants' acceptance of the government's civil servant salary plan, unofficially went on strike for one day yesterday and resumed work today. 300,000 construction workers and carpenters in Paris are demanding that construction subsidies continue to be issued. They are gathering in various districts of the city, preparing to petition the National Assembly and Prime Minister Ramadier. The police are on strict guard around the parliament and the Prime Minister's Office. The workers' representatives met with the leaders of the parliament, and as a result, no incidents occurred. The person in charge of the National Farmers' Association stated that if the government does not increase the wheat price limit, farmers will take action after the autumn harvest and may refuse to sell grain within a week or so.

[Associated Press, Paris, 17th] The French Parliament unanimously approved the Civil Affairs Reform Bill yesterday in an all-night meeting, stipulating the allocation of 24.2 billion francs to more than one million civil servants who have repeatedly threatened to strike.

### The Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East Adjourns – The Next Session Will Be Held in the Philippines

[UN Office in Shanghai, Chenggong Lake, 17th] The Committee of the Whole of the United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East held its last meeting here today, unanimously resolving that the next session of the Economic and Social Commission will be held in the Philippines in late November. Secretary-General Trygve Lie will consult with the Philippine government to determine whether the meeting will be held in Manila, the capital of the Philippines, or in other locations in the country. The Siamese representative, Waset Ya Ganli, urged the Economic Commission to consider holding the third session in Siam and suggested that the meetings should be held in rotation in various countries in Asia and the Far East. New Zealand's application to join as a member state has been transferred by the Committee of the Whole to the Economic Commission for a decision at the next session. When the Economic Commission held its first session in Shanghai last month, representatives from China, India, Siam, and the Philippines all invited the Economic Commission to hold its next session in their respective countries.

[United Press, Chenggong Lake, 17th] The United States suggested yesterday in the Security Council that the issue of whether former Japanese vassal states are qualified to attend the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East should be directly decided by the Allied Headquarters in Japan, but the Soviet Union suggested that it should be decided by the "Allied Authorities." As a result, the US proposal was passed by a vote of seven to two. It is reported that the Soviet Union still plans to submit its proposal to the Economic and Social Council.

### Jiang Tingfu Issues Statement

[Central News Agency, Chenggong Lake, 17th] Jiang Tingfu, the Chinese representative to the UN Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East and Chairman of the Commission, issued the following statement to the Central News Agency reporter alone after the close of the Committee of the Whole of the Commission. The Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East has resolved the membership issue for autonomous countries, such as Ceylon, Vietnam, and Indonesia, by allowing these countries to be sponsoring member states, which can participate in all the work of the Commission and its various institutions, but will not have the right to vote in the Commission itself. There was a time when the debate on this issue was very intense, but the Chinese delegation, in cooperation with other countries, was finally able to reach a compromise. One encouraging thing about the Committee of the Whole was that the general public attending the meeting understood the mission it was responsible for. If the member states attending the meeting can make good use of its achievements, the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East can assume an important function in the economic development of Asia.

### A Concubine's Ardent Love, a Man's Iron Heart - A Devoted Young Woman Commits Suicide

[Report from our newspaper] At 5 PM on the 16th, a female guest wearing a blue Shilim cloth qipao suddenly arrived at the Cathay Hotel on West Xinqiao. She claimed to be from Ningbo, named Li Qihua, 22 years old, and opened room 306. The next morning at 7:30 AM, the tea server discovered that she had taken poison. She was rushed to the hospital and fortunately survived.

According to investigations, Li lived at No. 37 Zengxiang Lane, Kangding Road. Her father works on a foreign ocean liner. During the War of Resistance, Li Qihua was engaged in the single-person smuggling business. At that time, she met Qin Linhai from Benniu and married him. In February of this year, Qin lost his job and went to Hong Kong to do business with his father-in-law. Li Qihua also temporarily lived in her mother's house. A month ago, Li went to a photo studio for a photograph and met Wang Ruihua, an employee. They interacted frequently, fell in love, and became inseparable. Li lamented her ill fate, regretting that they had not met before she was married. However, Wang was already married and had no intention of taking a second wife. Recently, Qin sent a letter from Hong Kong stating that he would return to Shanghai around the 18th of this month. Li knew that the good times would not last and conspired with Wang, but they could not find a good solution. On the 16th, Li went to the Cathay Hotel and summoned Wang to discuss eloping. Unexpectedly, Wang was unwilling to leave his family and run away with Li. At this point, Li became disillusioned with life and took sleeping pills to end her life. Before taking the poison, she wrote two suicide notes, both addressed to Wang Ruihua.

### Movie Ticket Prices Double - Trade Association Makes the Request - Approval Pending Review

[Report from our newspaper] The brewing of higher movie ticket prices has been in the works for a long time. The movie theater trade association previously submitted a document to the Social Affairs Bureau requesting that the ticket price be calculated based on the base price of the Republic of China year 26, according to the cost of living index, but it was rejected by the Social Affairs Bureau. Yesterday, the trade association submitted another document to the Social Affairs Bureau, stating that current water, electricity, labor, and advertising costs have all increased, and expenses have increased. First-run theaters need to open air conditioning during the summer season. If ticket prices are not adjusted, they will be unable to maintain operations. The Dahulu Theater has already closed due to losses, so it is requested that the ticket prices of all movie theaters in the city be generally increased by 100% starting on the 24th of this month. This price increase request is currently under review by the Social Affairs Bureau.

### Murder on the Mariag - A Corpse Discovered in a Wardrobe - Cafe Owner Dies at Sea - $8,000 USD Vanishes

[Report from our newspaper] A Westerner, C. H. Heilmeir, partnered with someone a few years ago to open the "Yankee Coffee" cafe in the Hongkou District of this city. Business was not bad, and he had some savings. In April of this year, Heilmeir suddenly became tired of life in Shanghai and planned to seek development in the New World. At that time, the cargo ship Mariag happened to be returning to the United States from Shanghai. Heilmeir knew several sailors on the ship and negotiated to act as a "yellow fish" (smuggled passenger), hiding on the ship to go to the United States. Therefore, Heilmeir sold his shares in the cafe to others for $8,000 USD and packed his bags to board the ship.

The Mariag is a cargo ship. Not long after it set sail, Heilmeir's body was shockingly discovered in a wardrobe. The $8,000 USD he obtained from selling his cafe shares had vanished. After the body was discovered on the ship, the sailors all claimed not to know him, and Heilmeir's body was immediately buried at sea in the ocean.

The matter came to the attention of the Canadian Police Department. When the Mariag arrived in Montreal on the 17th of this month, six sailors suspected of being involved were arrested. Under interrogation, two of them admitted to hiding Heilmeir on the ship as a "yellow fish," but they firmly denied the murder.

The case is currently under investigation, and how Heilmeir died is still a mystery. However, it is known that the temperature in the wardrobe where Heilmeir was hiding was above 180 degrees, so Heilmeir's death may have been caused by suffocation from the heat.

### The Name is Famous, but the Person is Not the Same - How Many Wu Guozhens Are There?

[Report from our newspaper] Wu Guozhen, the Mayor of Shanghai, is a name that everyone is familiar with.

However, very few people have noticed that there are another fourteen people with the same name as Mayor Wu. Although these people may be easily overlooked among the common people, they are quite interesting in their diverse forms.

Recently, the China Electric Power Plant No. 1 (CPEP No. 1) took a liking to this subject and captured these fifteen Wu Guozhens in the "Window of Shanghai" film, which will soon be released simultaneously with "Youth by the River."

When the photographers from CPEP No. 1, led by photographer Zhang Hongkang, were photographing the various Wu Guozhens, they went to great lengths. Some of the Wu Guozhens, because they did not understand the truth of filming a movie, hid away. Some were so frightened that their faces turned pale and they were at a loss. Some even saw the photographer holding a "strange thing" in one hand and an ID card in the other, thinking that they were coming to "arrest people," and were so scared that they refused to admit their identity. Finally, after several explanations, the matter was resolved satisfactorily. However, by the time the photographers achieved their goal, they were exhausted and their lips were parched.

Among these fifteen Wu Guozhens, two have now left Shanghai. One is a 31-year-old garment worker (see photo 13), who lived at No. 18 Wengjia Branch Lane in the Nanshi District. He recently won a lottery at his boss's place, took the money, and fled to his hometown of Changzhou. His boss is jumping mad about this!

One is from Yancheng, Jiangsu (see photo 14), 36 years old, who only recently settled in Shanghai in October of the year before last. He filled out "Jiangsu Provincial Government Employee" in the household registration form. But now he has gone to Taiwan to do business. He is also the only one among the other fourteen Wu Guozhens who has received a university education.

There is also a Wu Guozhen here (see photo 5) who used to have a bit of a "history." He was summoned by the District Court on February 21 of this year because he had borrowed 700,000 yuan from a man named Lu Zhihai on November 2 and December 15 of last year, and was later sued by Lu for failing to repay the debt on time. At the time, he claimed in court that he was still a boss, running the "Ruyi Restaurant Tiger Stove" at No. 271 Hanyang Road in Hongkou. Apparently, things didn't go too "ruyi" (as one wishes) later on. He has now changed careers and set up a noodle stall at the intersection of Huade Road and East Han County Luli. Although it's a small business, it's doing quite well. He is from Gaoyou, Jiangsu, 38 years old, and has lived in Shanghai for eight years.

Wu Guozhen (see photo 11), who was once so frightened that his face turned pale because he did not understand the truth of filming, works as a partner in the Yang Zhenghe [missing character] store at No. 976 Dongyou Road. He is 25 years old, from Tongzhou, Jiangsu, and has been in Shanghai for three years.

Wu Guozhen (see photo 8), who lives at No. 537 Shundao Road, used to be a police officer, but now he has switched to being a street vendor, selling imported sundries and seasonal fans at No. 288 Huaian Road. He is from Yancheng, Jiangsu, only 21 years old this year. Since "throwing away the gun and going into business," it is said that he has a good "business sense" and is making a decent living!

Wu Guozhen (see photo 2), who is still studying at Shuji Elementary School, is from Yuyao, Zhejiang, 15 years old, has been in Shanghai for eight years, and lives with his family, Wu Chengde, in Room 16 on the 7th floor of the Riverside Apartment. When they went to his home to take a picture, Wu Guozhen had just gone out to buy soy sauce. For a moment, his mother saw many strangers coming to his house looking for Wu Guozhen and thought that Wu Guozhen had gotten into trouble outside. She was so anxious that she asked what was going on first. After explaining their intention, she was relieved. While they were talking, Wu Guozhen also jumped in happily with a bottle of soy sauce.

There is also a Wu Guozhen (see photo 12) who works as a technician at the Shanghai Electric Power Company, 22 years old, from Yancheng. It took a lot of trouble to take his picture. First, the trade union held a meeting to discuss and approve it, then they sought his consent, and finally, after the approval of the factory director and manager, he officially went on camera.

There is also a shop assistant Wu Guozhen (see photo 3), 17 years old, from Zhenhai, Zhejiang, who has been in Shanghai for three years. He is currently an employee of the Tangsheng Leather Shoe Company at No. 733 Nanjing West Road, dealing with the ladies who come to buy shoes all day long. Look! Isn't he holding a ladies' white leather shoe in his hand, smiling and talking about business?

In the Rongchang Cloth Factory on Xiepo Tulu and Houli No. 6, a worker Wu Guozhen (see photo 6), is combing cotton yarn by semi-manual and semi-mechanical means, a 33-year-old man.

There is also a small vendor Wu Guozhen (see photo 7), who lives at No. 2 Xirenmei Lane, Guangxi Road, from Chaoyang, Guangdong, 18 years old. He is carefully looking at the ledger by the wall, wondering if business will be good today.

Finally, on the street, we met another Chen Guozhen (see photo 4), selling sesame seed cakes, smiling happily, probably doing well in business. He is 17 years old this year, studied for three years of elementary school, lives in the house opposite No. 1, Sanhe Lane on the road, from Huaiyin, Jiangsu, and has also been in Shanghai for seven years.

Here, there is also one (see photo 1), he is from Jianshi, Hubei, 45 years old, graduated from Tsinghua University in Peiping, Bachelor of Arts from Grinnell College, USA, PhD from Princeton University. He lives at No. 201 Anfu Road and works at No. 209 Jiangxi Road every day. This is the current Mayor of Shanghai, Wu Guozhen.

Among the remaining seven, the owner of the leather goods store at No. 165 Daming Road (see photo 10) is the relatively wealthy one. He is originally from Shang[missing character] County and is 38 years old this year.

Two are "friends of the office." One is an accountant at Room 409, No. 1454 East Zhongzheng Road (see photo 9), 39 years old, from Shanghai. Looking at him in a suit and leather shoes, with a cigarette in one hand and an abacus in the other, you can tell that he is a very shrewd person. One is an employee of the American Asia Insurance Company (see photo 15), coincidentally also 39 years old, from Shanghai, but a good hand at the typewriter.

CPEP No. 1 went to great lengths to take pictures, going to the point of exhaustion, and many jokes were made.

### There Are Also Many Who Share Names With Huang Jinrong and Li Lihua

Among the citizens of Shanghai, in addition to the fifteen Wu Guozhens, there are also ten people with the same name as Huang Jinrong, including two carpenters, one cobbler, two dock workers, two merchants, and two workers at a tiger stove. There are also as many as ten people with the same name as the movie star Li Lihua, including a manicurist, a midwife, a dancer, and several domestic workers. This statistical work was carried out by the Household Registration Section of the Police Department using the portrait number analysis method. It only took ten minutes to retrieve the paper cards for the above two people.

### The Problem of Foreign Exchange Settlement for Self-Funded Study Abroad Has Been Resolved - The US Consulate General Has Agreed to Issue Visas - Procedures for Going Abroad Can Be Handled at Any Time

[Report from our newspaper in Nanjing on the 18th] The issue of foreign exchange settlement and the amount of US dollars for self-funded students studying abroad has been delayed for a long time. It was temporarily decided to settle foreign exchange for 900 US dollars for going abroad, but the US Consul General in Shanghai believed that this amount was insufficient for two years of use and could not agree to issue a visa. Recently, the Bank of China has obtained the consent of the United States to allow self-funded students to temporarily buy 900 US dollars in foreign exchange for going abroad. If it is not enough in the future, they can apply to continue to purchase US exchange to make up the difference. The US Consul General in Shanghai has agreed to issue visas, and self-funded students can handle procedures for going abroad at any time.

### Ministry of Education Spokesperson Refutes the Claim of Mass Dismissals of Professors

[Report from Central News Agency in Nanjing on the 18th] Recently, there have been frequent rumors that the education authorities intend to dismiss a large number of professors from various schools, and the rumors are rife. The spokesperson of the Ministry of Education stated that the appointment of professors in various schools has always been handled by the school authorities with full authority, and the Ministry has never interfered, in order to maintain academic freedom and respect the status of professors.

### The Employment Problem for Graduates in Beiping is Serious - More Than Two-Thirds are Unemployed

[Report from China News Agency in Beiping on the 18th] The problem of finding employment for graduates of universities and colleges in Peiping is very serious. Engineering students have several job options to choose from, while liberal arts students have trouble finding even one job. Most institutions refuse to employ women. Of the 451 graduates of Peking University and 269 graduates of Tsinghua University, more than two-thirds are unemployed. Half of the 110 people seeking employment at Yanjing University have already found solutions. All 240 graduates of Beiyang [missing character] of Peiping can find employment, and one-fifth have already left school for work. Less than one-tenth of the graduates of the Teachers College can become teachers, and their general livelihood will become a problem.

### Severe Book Famine in the Northeast

[Report from Dihua News Agency] Previously, when the military situation in the Northeast was tense, various universities withdrew one after another. The major bookstores in this city that had established branches in Shenyang and Changchun, including Commercial Press, China Book Company, Zhengzhong Book Company, Dadong Book Company, Kaiming Bookstore, Wenhua Publishing House, and Duli Publishing House, found it difficult to withdraw, and it had too great an impact on local education and cultural undertakings, so they continued to operate as before. However, business was extremely sluggish due to the impact of the war, especially in Sipingjie and Andong, where the losses of books and accounts were even greater. Recently, although the Northeast [missing characters] and the printing industry have discussed printing textbooks, it has not become a reality due to the shortage of paper and high costs. Although the promotion of printing national textbooks by the newly established publishing industry in this city is strong, the funds are short, the number of copies printed is very small, and they dare not risk transporting them to the Northeast for supply. As for Commercial Press, China Book Company, Zhengzhong Book Company, etc., due to transportation difficulties and the fact that they have not negotiated properly with the local government, they do not know the actual quantity needed and how to supply it, which is under consideration. Therefore, the shortage of books in the Northeast is quite serious.

It is rumored that Mr. Hang's trip to Shanghai is related to the re-employment of professors in various universities for the next semester. When reporters inquired about this, Mr. Hang only stated: "This trip is for research-style discussions with relevant personnel on various educational issues." He did not acknowledge the rumor that the Ministry of Education had instructed various schools not to re-employ certain professors. Mr. Hang mostly remained silent regarding the various questions posed by reporters. According to reliable sources, the letters of appointment for professors at Fudan University, Jiaotong University, and other schools for the next semester have not yet been issued, causing anxiety among the professors. Vice Minister Hang's trip to Shanghai, accompanied by Chen Dongyuan, Supervisor of the Ministry of Education, may lead to a final decision.

### Jinan University Library: Buildings in Two Locations

[Our Dispatch] The Jinan University Library has buildings in two locations. One is located on East Tiyu Road, serving as the Science and Engineering College Library. In addition to specializing in books on science and business, it recently received 30,000 volumes of enemy and puppet books allocated by the Ministry of Education to compensate for wartime losses. The school authorities are planning to build a library that can accommodate 400,000 books and a reading room with 500 seats. The other location is on Baoshan Road, serving as the Arts and Law College Library, specializing in books on literature and law.

### Principal Yuan Dunli of Beiping Normal College Discusses the Crisis in National Education

[Our Nanjing, 18th dispatch] Yuan Dunli, President of Beiping Normal College, who attended the education seminar, recently told reporters: "Today's national education is facing a serious crisis. According to statistics, there are fewer than 50,000 qualified teachers nationwide, which is the result of a large number of qualified teachers changing professions. Currently, national primary school teachers earn only 150,000 to 160,000 yuan per month, which is less than a university student's scholarship and only equivalent to the income of a laborer in an ordinary government agency. The central government has designated national education funding to be the responsibility of local governments, but local governments cannot afford it. For example, Zhejiang Province should spend 46 billion yuan on national education, but its entire budget is only 40 billion yuan, which is insufficient even if it is all allocated to education. However, we believe that while higher education should be strengthened, national education should be saved even more. If a country does not have good national education, how can it have good citizens?"

### Director of Shandong Education Department Requests Approval from the Central Government for 5 Billion in Educational Relief Funds

### Dong Shouyi Issues a Statement Denying Requesting That the World Games Be Held

Dong Shouyi, Secretary-General of the National Sports Association, who attended the International Olympic Committee meeting, returned to Shanghai from Hong Kong by plane a few days ago. Yesterday, Dong issued the following statement to a reporter from Guoguang News Agency regarding the trip and his impressions:

I went to Stockholm, the capital of Sweden, a month ago to attend the International Olympic Committee meeting. I had met with Zhang Boling, Chairman of the Association, several times beforehand. Because the matter was international, I decided to attend. The other Chinese members of the committee, Wang Zhengting and Kong Xiangxi, were unable to attend due to busy schedules, so I went alone. The meeting lasted for four days. The main task was to approve the location for the 1952 World Games and to determine amateur qualifications. Various countries competed fiercely to host the Games, and they brought a large number of printed materials, photos, and films for publicity. The mayor of Los Angeles personally attended the meeting and delivered a moving speech. European countries were not to be outdone. As a result, Finland won the right to host the 1952 World Games with 15 votes. As for the rumor that I requested that the 1956 World Games be held in Peiping, China, it is completely untrue. Judging from the situation of the competition among the above-mentioned countries, it is clear that it is not something that I alone could propose rashly. After the meeting, I went to England to discuss accommodation and other matters for China's participation in next year's World Games. I stayed for two weeks and then returned to China. It is said that Dong is scheduled to host a reception for the sports press in this city in the next few days to report the details, and the Municipal Sports Association will also hold a tea party to welcome Dong.

### Qunsheng Returns to the Philippines, Wins Over Mahua Before Departure

[Central News Agency, Singapore, 16th] The Qunsheng basketball team, organized by overseas Chinese in the Philippines, has been here for a month and is scheduled to return to the Philippines by plane tomorrow. The team played a charity match against the Mahua team last night and won 66-36 in a one-sided game. The ticket revenue of 4,000 dollars, after deducting taxes, will be fully allocated to the flood relief fund in South China. In the 18 matches in Malaysia and Singapore, the team won 17 matches, losing only one by a small margin. It is generally believed that the team's accurate individual shooting is one of the key factors for victory. The level of sports here is solid, but compared to Qunsheng, the Malaysian teams are far behind in terms of individual skills and the average development of the entire team.

The Location of the Three-Nation Swimming Competition Is Undecided

The China-US-UK three-nation swimming friendly competition has been decided to be held on the 23rd, 24th, and 25th of this month. However, due to various reasons, the location was initially decided to be the Municipal Hongkou Swimming Pool, but later changed to the French Chamber of Commerce. However, it was reliably learned yesterday that the French Chamber of Commerce was unwilling to assist in the competition. Therefore, the Lizhi Society has entrusted Mayor Wu to negotiate with the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce. If there is still no satisfactory resolution, it will be decided to hold the competition at the Racecourse Swimming Pool.

### Silk and Cloth Association Plans Temporary Measures Again to Simplify Cotton Yarn Distribution Procedures

Advance Orders Can Be Used to Redeem Stack Receipts and Obtain Payments

[Our Dispatch] The Silk and Cloth Association is holding a temporary joint distribution of cotton yarn, originally scheduled for national and private yarn factories to provide 10,000 bales of cotton yarn each by the 15th of this month to participate in the distribution. Now, because the private factories' cotton yarn has not been delivered in time, the association has consulted with the Six District Cotton Spinning Association to formulate temporary measures to reduce time and simplify procedures, as follows: (1) The joint distribution of cotton yarn will be settled at a negotiated price of 8.8 million yuan per bale for 20-count cotton yarn. (2) Factories that have submitted advance orders but have not yet been allocated yarn can issue stack receipts. The stack receipts can be used to redeem the advance orders from the Silk and Cloth Association according to the number of advance orders and obtain payment to avoid delays. (3) Factories that have been approved for yarn allocation but have not yet submitted advance orders must submit stack receipts (one for each bale) to the Silk and Cloth Association next Monday (the 21st) to obtain payment and do not need to submit advance orders to avoid detours. This does not apply to those who have already submitted advance orders.

### Travelers Carrying National Currency to Guangzhou Are Limited to 500,000 Yuan, Amounts Exceeding This Must Pay a Security Deposit of Equivalent Value, Which Can Be Returned After Presenting a Certificate from the Guangdong Customs

For detailed reporting procedures, please inquire at the General Affairs Section of the General Affairs Department of this customs. Furthermore, travelers leaving Shanghai to travel to various parts of the country, whether traveling by boat, train, or plane, except for those who need to pass through Hong Kong or other foreign regions, or those who fly from Shanghai to Guangzhou as mentioned above, or those who take civilian ships or boats that do not operate according to ordinary shipping regulations to neighboring foreign ports or regions, there is currently no limit to the amount of domestic currency they can carry.

### Fluctuating Stock Prices on Chinese Stocks Conclude with Slight Firmness

Chinese stocks yesterday were mediocre and fluctuating, generally following the lead of American-Asian stocks. Retail investor sentiment appeared weak, with significant short selling. Around noon, support came from an easing of credit. Major players like numbers 23, 237, and others showed increased buying interest, and American-Asian stocks rebounded after an initial dip. Some active traders abandoned Sino-French and shifted to American-Asian stocks. Towards the close, there was a clear trend towards firmness. New-Kwong and King-Fook were also actively bought by number 204 at the opening, and prices were easily pushed up at the noon close. Unfortunately, due to the overall market trend, they became unusually weak mid-session.

The morning opened steadily. After American-Asian opened, numbers 160, 19, 110, and 218 bought, slightly raising American-Asian to 585 yuan. Numbers 224, 14, 152, and 180 sold, dropping the price to 575 yuan. Simultaneously, Sino-French was sold by numbers 231, 71, 32, and 85, reaching 3710 yuan. Immediate Sino-French was quiet with no transactions. Numbers 97, 226, and 85 pulled American-Asian up to 583 yuan. Number 219 and others also bought Sino-French, bringing it back up to 3770 yuan. Numbers 165, 186, and 180 sold, and number 91 sold after buying, causing American-Asian to fall to 569 yuan. Numbers 223 and 218 tried to push it up by ten yuan, but numbers 102, 69, 152, 223, 91, and 236 sold heavily. Numbers 185 and 76 bought and sold intermittently, resulting in a hesitant and still weak market. At 10:50 AM, numbers 24, 142, 89, and 103 heavily sold, pushing American-Asian down to 560 yuan. Numbers 183, 134, 97, 84, and 24 also unloaded Sino-French, causing it to fall to 3530 yuan. At this point, the market was most fearful and weak, with New-Kwong and King-Fook also seeing low prices. Numbers 14, 180, 152, and retail investors bought, and at 11:20 AM, the price recovered to 573 yuan before slightly consolidating. Subsequently, news of easing credit spread. Numbers 160, 65, 23, 12, 226, 237, and 167 bought aggressively, raising American-Asian to 580 yuan. Current American-Asian reached a high price of 567 yuan, with a difference of over ten yuan. Number 125, Kin-Cheng Bank, and others continued to arbitrage selling. Number 61 and others also closed positions, causing a slight dip. Sino-French was bought by numbers 22, 110, 157, 224, 4, 84, and 185, rising to around 3690 yuan. At this point, most active traders abandoned Sino-French and moved to American-Asian. Therefore, American-Asian was extremely stable towards the close, while Sino-French was significantly weak. After the close, the asking price for American-Asian remained firm. The result was that, compared to the previous close, immediate Sino-French shares were slightly lower, while American-Asian and China-Wool each rose by a little less than half a percent. Yung-Kong rose by one percent, New-Kwong and New-China remained flat, Sino-French and New-Asia were slightly down, King-Fook and Keen-Hing were slightly up, and Matches and Cement rose by a little more than half a percent. Lee-An and Five-Peace were flat, and the rest only rose slightly. For deferred shares, Sino-French was slightly down, Yung-Kong rose by half a percent, American-Asian, China-Wool, Keen-Hing, and King-Fook rose slightly, and other old shares were flat and weak.

Yesterday, Yung-Kong yarn futures outside the market rose from 10,000 yuan to close at 10,030 yuan. New shares opened at 210 yuan, fell to 197 yuan, and then closed at prices of 210 yuan and 213 yuan. Interest prices were 2 jiao 1 and 2 jiao 5 and a half.

### Weakness in Cotton Yarn Market

Yesterday's cotton yarn market opened with relatively firm footing. Later, due to the opening of Spinning and Construction yarn, activity was mediocre. Additionally, the credit situation among fellow traders remained tight in some areas, and sporadic selling continued in the market. Prices were unable to hold and declined. As a result, 42-count Blue Phoenix fell by 500,000 yuan from the previous day, to 17,770,000 yuan. Special Double Horse also fell by 200,000, to 11,600,000 yuan. Double Horse yarn fell slightly by 100,000, to 10,070,000 yuan. Other coarse and fine yarns such as 40-count, 32-count, 20-count, 16-count, and Brightness all fell slightly, ranging from 22,000 to 90,000 yuan.

Cotton Cloth Continues to Strengthen

Yesterday's cotton cloth market opened flat and weak. Subsequently, due to activity by Hankou merchants and renewed buying interest from outside the industry, prices were pushed up. As a result, the closing price of 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth rose by 10,000 yuan from the previous day, to 438,000 yuan. Various grades of fine cloth such as Five Blessings Color Ball, Blue Phoenix, and Sunshine Crane also rose by 5,000 to 8,000 yuan. Hankou merchants' purchases of colored cloth and Four Gentlemen serge were transacted at 485,000 yuan, an increase of over 10,000 yuan. Other bleached cloth, coarse cloth, twill, and blue drill cloth were also relatively stable.

Spinning and Construction Yarn Allocation

[Our Report] Yesterday, China Spinning and Construction Company, as usual, jointly allocated yarn on behalf of the Spinning and Adjustment Association, allocating a total of 967 pieces, all allocated to the replication industry. A total of 446 applicants were reported.

### Government Bonds Decline, Foreign Stocks Rise

Yesterday, government bonds rose but could not sustain the gains. Toward the close, they were forced lower by profit-taking. Category C opened at 7,500, with the high price nearly approaching the 8,000 yuan mark, but then fell back to close near the 7,000 yuan level. Numbers 360 and 555 bought, while numbers 538 and 552 sold, with approximately 1 million yuan in transactions. Compared to the previous close, Categories A and B fell slightly by 200 yuan, Category C fell by 400 yuan, Category D fell by 100 yuan, and only Category E remained flat.

Yesterday, foreign stocks were stimulated by outside-industry interest and rebounded again. Guangdong merchants and Jewish traders bought aggressively. Securities firms observed, while Northern merchants and money changers sold. Ewo Cotton was raised from 68,000 to close at 74,000. Rubber stocks were slightly weak. British American Tobacco rose most strongly. As a result, compared to the previous close, British American Tobacco alone rose by over ten percent, and other stocks each rose by a little more than half a percent.

### Credit Conditions Have Eased – National Banks and Bureaus Issue 61.3 Billion

[Our Report] Yesterday, the results of the clearing at the local clearinghouse showed that the four banks and two bureaus had a net outflow of 61.3 billion yuan, with the Central Bank alone accounting for 27 billion yuan. In addition, foreign banks had a net inflow of 17.6 billion yuan, exchange houses before number 50 had a net inflow of 37 billion yuan, and those after number 50 had a net inflow of 6.7 billion yuan. Credit conditions have eased, with dark interest rates at 1 jiao 8 fen to 2 jiao. It is reported that the main reason for the large outflow from national banks and bureaus yesterday was that after the suspension of trading in Yong-Kong yarn in Chinese stocks, trading volume in the stock exchange market decreased. Additionally, due to Friday's settlement, arbitrage trading also decreased significantly, so the 50% margin deposits were also withdrawn, resulting in the large outflow from national banks and bureaus. Furthermore, after the National Bank strictly prevented the arbitrage trading between Shanghai and South China recently, and with the new regulations announced by the Jianghai Customs regarding the export of national currency to other ports, the trend of arbitrage has been curbed, which also reduces the outflow of cash from the city.

### Agricultural Bank Accepts Pawned Tea - Tea Merchants Seek to Promote Sales Abroad

Selling Price May Exceed Government Purchase Price

The Central Trust Bureau is still preparing for the purchase of tea. The purchase period was originally scheduled to end on the 20th, but the Joint Treasury considered the difficulties of tea merchants and decided to extend the deadline by five days. To date, the Central Trust Bureau has not received any applications from tea merchants. It is understood that tea merchants are demanding a price that is 50% higher than the new price agreed upon in May. The national banks and bureaus believe that merchants already have a legitimate profit and cannot raise the price further. Therefore, tea merchants are independently seeking to promote exports. They have reached an agreement with the French company Yongxing Foreign Firm to sell 80% of the stored green tea. An agreement has been reached, and progress is also being made with ordinary green tea. The average selling price can be as high as US$1.40 per kilogram, exceeding the government purchase price. Therefore, they are not interested in the government's purchase. Tea merchants are actively raising funds to redeem the tea pawned to the Agricultural Bank.

### Sluggish Tea Sales

Yesterday's tea market saw sluggish sales of various domestic teas. Apart from continuous purchases by local shops and merchants, sales in areas such as Fengjing, Songjiang, Suzhou, and Wuxi remained stagnant due to continuous rain. However, industry insiders say that sales are expected to increase sharply once the weather clears. As for various export green teas such as Chun Zhen and Zhen Mei, sellers are maintaining a firm stance due to the relatively low inventory in the market. Although buying interest remains strong, transactions are still weak, and the market remains unchanged. As for other varieties, only Chen's coarse black tea is being sought by Wuchang Tea Company, and prices are also very firm.

### Rice Supply Exceeds Demand - Minimal Fluctuations in Japonica and Indica Rice

Yesterday, a total of over 4,700 shi of rice arrived in the northern and southern markets. The market was flat and firm in the morning, but weakened in the afternoon. Both Japonica and Indica rice saw minimal fluctuations, and the market lacked the strength to rise. White Yuan Zhong and Second Grade remained sluggish. Meanwhile, rice prices in Hankou fell sharply, and the supply of rice, wheat, and miscellaneous grains in Wuxi was exceptionally strong, breaking the highest record. Warehouses were already full, so the grain situation remains prosperous for the time being.

Due to limited production from factories and wheat still en route, flour prices fluctuated slightly. Factory flour, unified flour, and mixed brand flour all saw slight increases of around 1,000 yuan. Bran sales remained sluggish, falling by another 1,000 yuan. Soybean cake sales in rural areas increased, rising slightly by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan, while Yingkou cake rose by 3,000 to 4,000 yuan. Soybean sales remained weak, with supply still coming from the Yangtze River region and some from the Northeast. Prices continued to fall by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan.

Bean sales were unsatisfactory, falling by another 10,000 yuan. Red beans were weak, falling by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan. Red sorghum was scarce in both supply and demand, and the market was mediocre. Corn supply exceeded demand, and the market was stable. After continuous declines, raw peanuts saw increased sales, rebounding by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan. Sesame supply was slightly higher, with few buyers, and prices plummeted by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan. Broad beans continued to flood the market with slow sales, falling by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan. Garden peas were stable, and wheat was flat.

The oil market continued to see mixed ups and downs. Raw soybean oil remained popular, rebounding by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan. Rapeseed oil and sesame oil sales were sluggish, falling by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan, forming a contrasting trend.

Longan Falls Steadily

Longan sales have been sluggish recently, and the market had risen too much previously. Recent declines have also been significant, with prices falling steadily by a little less than 30% in recent days, and few buyers.

### Four District Silk Weaving Industry Association Applies for Increased Production Loan Amount

[Our Report] Production loans for the silk weaving industry in this city have been approved by the Joint Treasury, with a principle of 5 million yuan per loom, a term of three months, and an interest rate of five percent. The Four District Silk Weaving Industry Association believes that the loan amount is insufficient and convened a board meeting at 11:00 AM yesterday to discuss the matter. It was decided to submit another letter to the Joint Treasury, requesting that the loan amount per loom be increased to 15 million yuan. There were two other proposals: (1) Request the Central Trust Bureau not to adopt the auction method for rayon and to continue to allocate it. (2) The association is currently soliciting opinions from its members on the rayon quota allocated by the Transportation Control Committee, and the allocation will be made after the opinions have been collected.

### Sericulture Production and Sales Guidance Association to Hold Twelfth Meeting Today

The Sericulture Production and Sales Guidance Committee of the Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of Economic Affairs will hold its twelfth committee meeting at 10:00 AM today (the 19th). It is understood that in addition to deciding on the date for autumn silkworm egg acid treatment, the meeting will also discuss the request from the Third District Silk Reeling Industry Union to issue 10% of the loan funds and 10% of the profits in raw silk or to pay only 80% in kind to repay the entire loan. This proposal is expected to spark heated debate. According to the original principles of silkworm cocoon loans, manufacturers who received loans should reel raw silk, which should be purchased by the government. However, the current market is experiencing a shortage of raw materials, and maintaining domestic sales is also an urgent task. The association may adopt a compromise solution when making a decision.

### Rayon from Barter Trade with Japan Expected to Arrive Next Month

[Our Report] According to the Central Trust Bureau, (1) the rayon handled by the bureau under the barter trade with Japan will be shipped in batches in this month and the next two months (August and September). Therefore, the allocation volume is expected to be more abundant than before. The allocation method remains the same, but the matter of adjusting the allocation price will be decided after Director Wu returns to Shanghai. A general outline is expected by next Monday.

Suspension of Hog Bristle Purchase

(2) Since the bureau started purchasing tung oil and hog bristles, the purchase volume of tung oil has been quite large. Some hog bristles have already been purchased, but the purchase has been temporarily suspended due to the revision of the purchase price.

### Industrial and Commercial Loan Syndicate Officially Announced to End

Last year, the Central Bank launched military discount and re-mortgage loans to support small-scale industrial production and export trade. The China Communications Bank and other three banks and two bureaus jointly formed an industrial and commercial loan syndicate with commercial banks and money shops. A total of 9.9599 billion yuan was lent out. Loan units in the cotton spinning industry totaled 418. This year, after the establishment of the discount committee by the National Bank in April, the syndicate's business was transferred. All loans of the syndicate were fully recovered and settled by the 7th of this month. The Industrial and Commercial Loan Syndicate was officially announced to end this week.

### Spot Cotton Stable

Yesterday's spot cotton market remained weak, with few transactions. Buyers were hesitant due to the continued decline in cotton yarn prices and mostly observed. Yarn mills in the local market offered low prices, causing sellers to be unwilling to sell cheaply. Therefore, trading became sluggish. However, after the market had stopped rising and started to fall in the past two days, the market has stabilized yesterday. The factory delivery price for each grade was: Tongzhou 1.84 million, and the warehouse delivery price was: Shandong Binzhou 2.12 million, 2.15 million to 2.17 million, Shashi 2.04 million, Hankou fine velvet 1.90 million, 1.95 million to 2.03 million, Guide 1.92 million, US Middling 2.05 million, Pudong Fire Machine 1.70 million, Zhoupu Seed Cotton 325,000 per load.

### Cigarette Transactions Become Active

Yesterday's cigarette market saw few arrivals due to continuous rain. Sales were quite brisk. Subsequently, the market atmosphere stabilized as door-to-door shops saw good retail sales. The number of people in the market was higher in the afternoon, and traders bought in low, leading to more active transactions and rising prices. The final price of 10-pack British American Tobacco cigarettes rose by 140,000 yuan from the previous day, to 8.92 million yuan. Old Knife Brand was 7.65 million, also up 100,000. Five-Flower was 6.85 million, up 60,000 to 70,000.

Throughout the day, there was a lot of buying for higher-grade cigarettes. Three-Cannon was 69,500 yuan, Da-Nan-Men was 82,000 yuan, and Shang-Za-Bu was also bought. Other Chinese brand cigarettes such as Mei-Li-Jin-Yuan, Bai-Lan-Di-Ke-Lei-Si, Red-Jin-Cross, and other brand strip cigarettes were actively sold in the afternoon, with prices rising from 500 yuan to 2,500 yuan. American Camel, Six-Root Horsepower, and other strip cigarettes and canned cigarettes remained popular, but with constant arrivals from abroad, some were being sold off at a loss, leading to lower prices.

### On the Issue of Opening Trade with Japan, Industry and Commerce Advocate Adopting a Chain System

After the Allied Headquarters decided to open private trade with Japan in mid-next month, restoring trade between China and Japan, the Shanghai industrial and commercial sectors have paid great attention to it. It is generally agreed that the National Government needs to import materials, and there are major imports and exports. Moreover, the Japanese side declared that it would obtain US$50 million in trade from our country from mid-next month to the end of this year. At a time when our country's industry and commerce are declining and costs are high, it is difficult to compete with it. Therefore, some people advocate implementing a chain system to exchange materials exported to Japan for industrial raw materials and rayon needed domestically. Others advocate adopting a subsidy system, but most industrial and commercial figures believe that adopting a chain system is more appropriate.

Wu Yun-Chu Advocates Strict Control

[Central News Agency Special Dispatch] Wu Yun-Chu, Chairman of the National Industrial Association, expressed his opinion on the resumption of Sino-Japanese trade yesterday, believing that under the current circumstances, restoring Sino-Japanese trade is not only useless to the development of our country's industry, but also harmful. Because the price of Japanese goods must be cheaper than our country's goods, the import of Japanese goods will seriously hit our national industry. Therefore, he advocates that the government should consider slowing down the opening of Sino-Japanese trade. He also stated that if the government decides to open it on schedule, it must strictly control the import of Japanese goods to ensure that our country's industrial production does not suffer losses. He also advocates that future Sino-Japanese trade should be operated by the country, with profits going to the public, to avoid manipulation and monopoly by wealthy merchants. He said that the Industrial Association will hold a meeting next Thursday to discuss the issue of restoring Sino-Japanese trade, and will provide the government with opinions after the meeting.

Some Commodities Can be Sold to Japan

[Our Report] According to Shou Jing-Wei, Secretary-General of the Chamber of Commerce, the selection method for the business delegation to Japan is still being studied by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and the announcement is pending. In principle, one representative may be produced for each type of commodity. As for how many commodities our country is suitable for exporting to Japan, it remains to be investigated. What our country hopes to import from Japan is nothing more than machine parts and industrial raw materials. The opposition of the supervisory committee members to the resumption of Japanese private trade is extremely insightful politically; but in economic terms, our country has some commodities that can only be sold in Japan. At the same time, if other countries resume business with Japan while our country adopts a passive attitude alone, it is not a good strategy.

### Supply and Demand of Cotton in China in the 36th Year of the Republic of China

— Shi Xin-Quan

China's cotton production reached 13 million dan before the war. After the war, due to food shortages, traffic obstruction, and high production costs, cotton farmers were unwilling to plant cotton, and production declined sharply. In the 34th year of the Republic of China, it decreased to 5 million dan, and in the 35th year, it increased to 7.4 million dan, but it was still far from the pre-war level.

This year's new cotton will soon enter the market. According to a survey by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, the weather was good during the sowing season in the 36th year, and the cotton fields in various provinces have increased. It is estimated that the cotton field area is 39.04 million mu. If calculated at an average production of 25 jin of lint per mu, this year's cotton production is estimated to reach 9.7 million dan.

| Year   | Cotton Field (Thousands of mu) | Production (Tens of thousands of dan) |
| ------ | ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| 26     | 59,316                         | 12,720                               |
| 34     | 22,796                         | 5,000                                |
| 35     | 29,418                         | 7,430                                |
| 36     | 39,040                         | 9,740                                |

There has been no significant change in spindle equipment in recent years. There are a total of 4.5 million spindles in the country, but due to insufficient power and lack of parts, they have not been fully operational. The current average operating rate is about 80%, which is 3.6 million spindles in operation.

Taking the production of 20-count yarn as an example, each spindle needs 1 pound of cotton per day when it operates for 20 hours, and it works for 26 days per month. Each spindle needs 26 pounds of raw cotton, and 312 pounds per year. 3.6 million spindles need 1,123.2 million pounds, equivalent to 10.21 million dan, which is 2.268 million bales of cotton.

The estimated cotton production in the 35th year was 9.7 million dan. However, the national annual demand for cotton wool and cotton clothing, as well as the sales of the hand-woven textile industry, is 2.25 million dan. The cotton used by the hand-woven cotton textile industry is about 2.5 million dan. The demand for cotton from both sources is 4.75 million dan. The cotton stored by cotton farmers is about 550,000 dan. Therefore, the cotton available to the textile industry this year is about 4.4 million dan, which is 997,000 bales.

According to a survey by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, the total cotton inventory in ten provinces, including Hebei and Hubei, is 1.14 million dan. Adding 640,000 dan in Shanghai, the total is 1.78 million dan, equivalent to 390,000 bales.

| Province | Thousands of dan |
| -------- | ---------------- |
| Shanghai | 640              |
| Hebei   | 229              |
| Shandong | 143              |
| Henan   | 120              |
| Jiangxi  | 5                |
| Shaanxi | 150              |
| Hubei   | 258              |
| Hunan   | 22               |
| Anhui   | 24               |
| Zhejiang | 23               |
| Jiangsu  | 169              |
| Total    | 1,781            |

Note: The cotton inventory in Shanghai is 580,000 dan in factory warehouses and 60,000 dan in foreign warehouses.

Based on the above situation, in the 36th year of the cotton calendar, if the national textile industry wants to maintain an 80% operating rate, there will still be a shortage of 4.04 million dan of raw cotton, which is 890,000 bales.

This shortfall will inevitably continue to rely on imports of foreign cotton to supplement. Otherwise, the 3.6 million spindles will not be able to continue operating. To reduce the import of foreign cotton and reduce the consumption of foreign exchange, the only way is to actively increase domestic cotton production and improve the quality of mechanically produced cotton. At a time when senior representatives of the US Cotton Council are on their way to China to investigate the cotton situation, I would like to briefly describe the domestic cotton supply and demand situation in the 36th year of the Republic of China for the reference of relevant parties.

### China Automobile Manufacturing Company: A Lone Struggle with a Bright Future

— Special Correspondent for This Newspaper, Sheng Zhi

(This newspaper's report) China Automobile Manufacturing Company recently borrowed five million US dollars from the United States to purchase a complete set of new automobile manufacturing machinery. This loan has already been guaranteed by our country's highest authorities and will be delivered as soon as the Executive Yuan approves the foreign exchange settlement. If so, our country's automobile manufacturing industry will make further significant contributions.

During the War of Resistance, we cannot bury the achievements of the industrial sector. Working diligently behind the scenes, they have indeed added considerable strength to the country, both large and small. Recalling the past, on several dilapidated highways in the rear, although only a few "unimpressive" diesel and charcoal vehicles were running on the surface, at their core, they were purely the result of our own hard work. Under the severe conditions of being blockaded at the time, we relied on this "point" to avoid losing the vitality of our major arteries.

Falling Down and Getting Up

Speaking of automobiles, one cannot help but think of the spirit of hard work in the automobile factories at that time. In the turbulent situation of wartime, they repeatedly fell down, but then repeatedly got back up. At that time, the China Automobile Manufacturing Company, which appeared in the rear as a lone struggler, was also one of the hardworking elements in hundreds of departments throughout the country's industrial sector. At that time, everyone may have been blinded by the drivers, the lucky ones of the "motors roaring, gold pouring in" era, and instead overlooked the hardworking staff behind the scenes. At that time, who would have imagined that while the drivers were indulging in pleasure, the engineers were eating simple vegetarian meals in the laboratory!

Moving to Guilin to Manufacture Parts

Speaking of this unique force, the history of China Automobile Manufacturing Company must be told simply from the beginning. Originally, "Zhong Qi" was established as early as the 23rd or 24th year of the Republic, with the factory located in Gaochang Temple in Shanghai. At that time, everyone was full of hope and excitedly preparing, but the "January 28th" battle brought a major blow. Fortunately, they could rely on the protection of the concession at that time, and the machinery was not damaged. However, the progress of the work was considerably hindered as a result. The company felt the pressure from external forces at the time, and in order to seek a permanent solution, it jointly established a "Joint Factory" with the Railway General Machinery Factory in Zhuzhou. When everything was ready and they were preparing to carry out power generation work, the "August 13th" battle unexpectedly broke out in quick succession. Soon, Hankou was in danger, and Zhuzhou was shaken. Therefore, the newly installed machinery was dismantled again and moved to Liangfeng, Guilin, where it barely managed to stand its ground and began manufacturing some parts.

Manufacturing Automobiles in Kowloon

While "Zhong Qi" was fleeing inland, it was still continuously ordering machinery from abroad. In order to obtain convenience in replenishing materials, it established the "Nanhua Ironworks" in Tsuen Wan, Kowloon. In terms of scale, it was already considered one of the leading companies in the domestic automobile industry at that time. Manufacturing engines and automobiles by themselves, it was the first time a brilliant flower was released in the domestic automobile industry.

Factory Bankrupt, Leaving Only an Empty Shell

The country's difficulties severely threatened the industrial sector. When the Pacific War broke out, almost all of the essence that China had left overseas went bankrupt. "Zhong Qi" was certainly no exception. More than 300 pieces of important machinery in the Nanhua Ironworks were looted by the Japanese army. Since then, the "Nanhua Ironworks" existed in name only, almost leaving only an empty shell.

Before the outbreak of the war, the Nanhua Factory already had products. After more than 200 engines and a large number of parts were transported to Chongqing, there were still a large number of parts piled up in the areas of Yangon, Lashio, and Zhefang. However, due to the "one-sided" war at that time, the materials in Huitong could not be evacuated in time, and they were all sacrificed.

Repair Shop in Chongqing

Fortunately, these more than 200 engines were transported to Chongqing in time, which indeed played a significant role in subsequent transportation.

Immediately after the National Army withdrew from Hunan, "Zhong Qi" was left with only the last stronghold in Chongqing. Fortunately, there were still some machines at that time, and work could continue, becoming a major repair shop in the rear.

Chongqing Branch Opens New Path

After the victory, everyone returned to their positions. "Zhong Qi" had a grand plan. In addition to preparing to resume self-made automobiles, in order to adapt to the urgent needs of the present, it transformed the branch factory remaining in Chongqing from heavy industry to light industry, reorganized it into the "Textile Machinery Company," and opened up a new path for the impoverished industrial sector.

Manufacturing Spinning Spindles to Seek Improvement

After the reorganization of the company in Chongqing, it began to manufacture a large number of spinning spindles. Recently, it has customized more than 10,000 spindles for the Shanghai Zhongfang Company, which are expected to be delivered in full next month. After comparing the test results with the Japanese "Sansha Style," the ratio is 82 points to 91 points. The results have reached the standard, and efforts are still being made to continue improving, striving for perfection, and hoping that the second batch of products can compete with imported products, or even surpass them.

At present, many small yarn factories in Chongqing have adopted self-made spindles. Yufeng Yarn Factory is one of them. However, Yufeng's spindles are American-style, and the difference is that American yarn spindles are larger in size, and in terms of flexible application, they are not as good as Japanese-style. (The Japanese style is imitated according to British standards)

Seeking Development in the Southwest

According to the plan of the Textile Machinery Company, future business development will focus entirely on the southwestern provinces. It is hoped that each region will have its own self-made textile factories. However, judging from the current product performance, only making spindles can reach 20,000 to 40,000 spindles per month. If making a complete set of machines, only 20,000 to 30,000 spindles can be made each year, which is just enough for a small-scale yarn factory in the interior.

Manufacturing Engines Benefits Agriculture

In addition, the factory also manufactures some one or two-cylinder engines. In terms of agriculture, milling rice, sawing wood, construction, fire fighting, etc., but because the general farmers' level of knowledge is not high enough at present, it cannot be widely promoted for a while.

A portion of the engines that remained during the war, because a large number of ready-made cars poured in after the victory, almost all lost their effectiveness. Therefore, after further research and improvement, this batch of engines became the engines for transport ships. At that time, many manufacturers who returned east relied on this point of power to solve the transportation difficulties at that time.

Confiscated Items Under Negotiation

Speaking of the "Nanhua Ironworks" stranded in Tsuen Wan, Kowloon, although the machinery was seized by the Japanese, the factory buildings were well preserved. The recently started part of the work is only sand casting and repair. Compared with the scale in the past, there is a feeling of "cannot be mentioned on the same day." However, more than 300 pieces of machinery previously looted by the Japanese army have now been found in Japan, and negotiations are underway with MacArthur's headquarters. It is possible that they will all be returned in the near future.

Engineers Go to the United States

After the victory, "Zhong Qi" sent six engineers to intern in various factories in the United States. At the same time, it borrowed 5 million US dollars from the United States to order the master machine for manufacturing automobiles. However, the condition in the United States is that our government needs to guarantee it. Although it was approved by the highest authorities at that time, due to the need to settle foreign exchange at the official price, it is still placed in the Executive Yuan. If this matter does not have much difficulty, then there may be hope of producing cars next year or the year after.

Shanghai Factory Site Under Consideration

The old factory site in Gaochang Temple in Shanghai is still partly used by the navy. In the future, after this batch of machinery is transported, the issue of the factory site is still a matter that needs to be considered. The factory site in Zhuzhou was not greatly damaged in the war. Based on past experience, setting up a factory in the interior may be safer than in Shanghai. Finally, standing in China's impoverished industrial sector and looking forward to a gratifying future, we feel that the spirit of hard struggle in the past still needs us to persist unremittingly!

While "Zhong Qi" was fleeing inland, it established the "Nanhua Ironworks" in Tsuen Wan, Kowloon, manufacturing automobiles and other items, releasing a unique brilliance in the domestic automobile industry!

### Lingnan University Affiliated Middle School: Student Murders Teacher, Overturning Truth, Previous Confession Pending Investigation

— Special Correspondent for This Newspaper, Liang Feng

Principal Resigns to Take Responsibility, Department of Education Handles Strictly

Guangzhou, 14th (Air Mail)

Speaking of Guangzhou's most prestigious schools, apart from Sun Yat-sen University, Lingnan University probably has the longest history. For decades, it has cultivated many talents, and they have retained all the excellent teaching spirit of the school. The students in all departments, including the university proper, as well as the affiliated middle school and elementary school, are mostly children from wealthy families. They are well-fed and clothed, and the academic atmosphere has always been the best. They do not cause trouble and do not strike. Although they have the nickname "Lingnan Bulls," they usually behave well, except for sometimes showing a bit of their bull nature on the sports field. Unfortunately, in this peaceful atmosphere, this highly regarded school suddenly experienced a shocking and sensational murder case that shocked the country.

When the incident occurred, the reporter had previously reported the process via telegraph. However, although the incident occurred several weeks ago, and three students have surrendered, the main perpetrator is still at large, so the case has not yet come to an end. Moreover, it is not only a matter of the life and death of individuals, but it is actually related to the entire education system and social atmosphere. Therefore, the reporter will make a detailed report on the inside story of the incident.

Fists Rained Down, Kicks to the Back

The incident occurred on the evening of June 28th. At that time, summer vacation had already begun, and only more than 30 high school students were left in the school to review their coursework in preparation for the graduation exam. Because Cai Huifu was the Dean of Studies of the affiliated middle school and a teacher of the senior three students, he was invited by the students that night to tutor them in chemistry. Mr. Cai was kind and amiable, but he never condoned students and misled their future. Because there were sixty practice questions in the chemistry textbooks of the senior three classes, and a total of one hundred questions in the three books from senior one to senior three A, B, and C, one-fifth of them had not been taught due to the wartime evacuation. Therefore, the students requested that this part be exempted from the exam and the number of practice questions be reduced to forty. However, Mr. Cai believed that this was agreed upon by the school and he could not make the decision personally. At the same time, he sincerely advised them, saying that the graduation exam was just a formality, and even if they graduated in this way, they would still not be able to pass the university entrance exam. He encouraged them to study hard so that they would have a way. Who knew that as soon as he finished speaking, a flute suddenly sounded from the student crowd, and at the same time all the lights went out, and strange noises rang out. Cai immediately rushed out of the classroom, intending to go downstairs and leave. Unexpectedly, in the darkness, fists rained down, and they fought from the third floor to the second floor. In the chaos, he was suddenly kicked in the back, so he could not stand firmly and fell down eight steps from the second floor steel staircase to the platform between floors. The students knew that they had caused trouble, so they quietly dispersed.

Pre-emptive Table Blocking, Planned Conspiracy

At that time, it was about 10:30 pm. The school's electrician discovered that the lights in all the classrooms were off, so he planned to go to the second floor to check the main switch. First, he found that someone had pre-placed a chicken coop-style chair and table used in a classroom at the entrance to the staircase. When he reached the platform between floors, he found Mr. Cai lying diagonally on the ground, so he helped him up. Then, he inspected the switch box and found that the box door had been pried open, and a Boy Scout rope was tied to the main switch, presumably used to pull the switch open at that time. At the same time, next to the electrical box was originally a teacher's dormitory, and at the entrance of the dormitory, someone had also pre-placed a table and chair, looking like they were attempting to prevent people inside from coming out to rescue him. From this, it seems that their humiliation of the teacher was a planned conspiracy!

Instructing Family Not to Announce, Only Saying: "Students Hit Me!"

Mr. Cai's dormitory was less than fifty yards from the scene of the incident, and it would not have taken more than three minutes to arrive, but at that time, Mr. Cai only returned to his residence at twelve o'clock. According to Mrs. Cai, Zhang Biyin, at that time, Mr. Cai was in unbearable pain and vomited all night. He only said, "Students hit me!" and did not mention anything else. He also instructed his family not to announce it to avoid losing the teacher's dignity. The next morning, his injuries worsened, so he was sent to the city by ambulance for treatment, and he died of his injuries at eleven o'clock!

Pregnant Widow, Pitiful Orphans

Mr. Cai was from Jieyang County, Guangdong Province, and was forty-six years old. His family was poor when he was young, and he made a living as a peddler. He studied while working. At that time, Mr. Yao, the pastor of the Baptist Church in his hometown, believed that Cai was intelligent, so he funded him to study at Guangyi Middle School in Hai County. He studied diligently and was always ranked first in every exam. Later, he was funded to go to the Physics Department of Shanghai Hujiang University, where he still studied while working and obtained a Bachelor of Science degree. He then went to the University of the Philippines for further studies and obtained a Master of Physics degree. After returning to China, he served as a teaching assistant in the Physics Department of Shanghai University, the principal of Wuchang Bowen School, and other positions. He taught at Lingnan University Affiliated Middle School from the 27th year of the Republic and was promoted to Dean of Studies due to his excellent performance, which he has held for ten years now. It is unfortunate that he sacrificed himself in this way. His funeral arrangements were desolate, and the situation was extremely tragic. He left behind three sons and one daughter. Mrs. Cai is still pregnant, and we can imagine the extent of Mrs. Cai's grief!

Three Surrendered, Main Perpetrator at Large

Because the incident was a murder case, the police sent people to guard all the students in the class. However, after three days, there were still no clues, and during the custody period, Shen Zhizu (nephew of the traitor Shen Yi), a student in the class, had already absconded. Later, on July 7th, five prosecutors and clerks from the court, along with several inspectors and police officers from the police station, and Mr. Yao, the Director of Education, investigated with all their strength for the whole day, using various methods of persuasion. Director Yao also gave a half-hour speech, encouraging the perpetrators to confess, and saying, "Being brave in admitting mistakes is a behavior that young people should have. Their motives are probably due to a moment of impulse!" Under this persuasion, the students were moved to tears, and Gong Jinzhou, Guan Huiming, and Du Kunye surrendered. Gong confessed to opening the lock of the electrical switch box, Guan confessed to turning off the electrical switch, and Du confessed to hitting Cai with a punch. Liu Shangzhi also surrendered on behalf of Shen Zhizu, confessing that Shen was the main culprit. The court then took the three students back for interrogation, and Liu Shangzhi was instructed to immediately inform Shen Zhizu to quickly surrender to the authorities. The remaining students could regain their freedom that day, but their graduation exams were therefore shelved, waiting for the approval of the Department of Education to be held.

Three Detained Students Retract Previous Confession

The case can be considered to have some clues, but on the 7th, when the court opened a hearing, the three detained students suddenly retracted their previous confessions, only admitting that their initial confession was only out of righteous indignation to avoid the suffering of all the students being detained. So the truth is still worth pondering.

As for the school authorities' handling of the aftermath, the general public here has quite a few criticisms. Because after the secret meeting of the school's board of directors, there is still no definite guarantee for the family of the deceased. As for the students, Li Yinglin, the principal of the school (currently also the Director of the Guangdong Branch of the Executive Yuan), emphasized that the students' crime was a personal problem. However, the family of Du Kunrong, the student who surrendered, said that the student had been boarding at Lingnan University Affiliated Elementary School since the second grade of elementary school. Over the years, he moved with the school. He was indeed nurtured and raised by Lingnan. The school should also be responsible this time. And a certain educator here also said: The occurrence of this incident is actually due to the failure of moral education, and those responsible for moral education in the school should bear full responsibility.

School Principal Resigns to Take Responsibility

Therefore, the principal and director of moral education of the school's affiliated middle school have both resigned to take responsibility, but whether they will be approved remains to be decided by the school board of directors.

Indeed, this tragic case is not only an educational problem, but also a very serious social problem. During the years of the War of Resistance, schools moved and relocated, and the students' education greatly declined. Due to the influence of the social atmosphere, moral concepts also declined, and the future feels even more terrifying. Therefore, the Provincial Cultural Association also said in its letter to the Department of Education regarding this case: "This unfortunate tragic case not only violates the Chinese people's respect for teachers and the importance of morality for thousands of years, but also creates a trend of students making trouble and defying superiors. Its impact on the world and people's hearts is no less than that of the Communist Party, which kills, sets fires, and harms people..."

The Department of Education Expresses Strict Handling

As for the Department of Education's handling of the matter, the main points are: (1) Students Shen Zhi and other four, and student representatives Liu Shangzhi and Cen Xiaoxiao, are all expelled from school. The reason for the expulsion of the student representatives is the improper handling after the incident occurred; (2) All students in the class, except those who did not attend class on the night of the incident, will be given a major demerit once; (3) If other students have criminal behavior, the school will investigate and determine the severity of the case separately and give them punishment; (4) The students who have been handed over to the court will be tried separately by the court. And Yao said sternly: The beginning and end of the case have been reported to the Ministry of Education for record. As for his personal expression on this case, he said: "Extremely painful and regretful. This cannot but be said to be a failure of education. We must never condone the criminal students. We must face the ugliness and handle it strictly." And said: "Hope that the educational system will gain opportunity from Mr. Cai's sacrifice."

### Swine Fever Spreads on Taiwan Island

— Reporter for This Newspaper, Yang Yu

Taipei, 4th (Air Mail)

In late November last year, when the reporter introduced the Danshui Veterinary Vaccine Manufacturing Institute in Taiwan to readers, I remember writing at the end: "Although this institution is costly, its power is worth emphasizing." I hope that the authorities will give strong support. Today, the facts have given me the answer: the entire island is spreading with a terrible swine fever, and the amount of vaccine serum produced by the institute due to limited funds is only one-tenth of the amount needed by various counties. Prevention is impossible beforehand, and treatment is impossible afterward, creating a severe new threat to farmers on the island.

Cattle Plague

Fortunately Did Not Occur

In the past, when farmers in this province encountered swine fever, as long as the plague envoy arrived, the people would habitually lead out all the pigs to receive injections. However, at present, quarantine at the seaports is not thorough, and smuggled pigs bring in germs, which easily infect the island's hybrid pigs with no resistance; political epidemic prevention is unsound, and epidemic prevention administration is as if it is non-existent. In addition, vaccine serum cannot be supplied in large quantities. According to statistics, at least hundreds of thousands of pigs have died from epidemics since the restoration.

Dr. Liu Rongbiao, Associate Professor of National Taiwan University, spent two weeks investigating the veterinary epidemic situation in the entire province: the most terrible cattle plague, which had been extinct for nearly twenty years, fortunately did not occur. Otherwise, more than half of the cattle in Taiwan may have died, affecting rural farming and food production, which would have been unthinkable. Not long ago, the Shanxi Relief Association sent a batch of dairy cows. At that time, they were detained at the Zhu Cuo Lun Ranch outside Taipei for as long as a month and subjected to strict quarantine. As a result, cattle plague and bovine babesiosis were not found, but thirteen of them were infected with the cattle grub disease (Hypodermabovis) that had never been seen in Taiwan Province before. After thorough removal, they have been declared safe.

Slaughterhouses

Major Medium

Among swine epidemics, swine fever, swine plague, and paratyphoid fever are the most rampant, followed by the sporadic spread of swine erysipelas. Most smuggled pigs stay in the coastal areas, and swine epidemics originate from here and gradually invade the interior. Now they are gradually approaching the mountains. These infectious diseases not only bring about the doom of pig extinction, but also can infect the human body to a considerable extent. Farmers secretly slaughtering sick pigs for food or trade further increases the chances of artificial swine disease. According to Dr. Liu's investigation and inspection of four slaughterhouses, he determined that 100% of the slaughtered pigs were infected with swine fever and swine plague. However, there are no inspection regulations at present, nor are there dedicated veterinary doctors to inspect them. Slaughterhouses have become the main medium for infectious diseases.

The death of pigs certainly causes panic about meat food, and it is difficult for farmers to obtain manure fertilizer, but especially the death of breeding sows leads to the hopelessness of future reproduction. Perhaps swine epidemics are ignored in the country because the land is too vast, but on this small island, it has become a major event, and no farmer is not anxious.

Talking About Increasing Production

Thorough Epidemic Prevention

There are countermeasures: strictly implement seaport quarantine to prevent smuggling; urgently allocate a large amount of funds to increase the production of vaccine serum; the first step in epidemic prevention administration starts from the township offices. The solid foundation of Taiwan's food policy in the past was partly due to the thoroughness of livestock epidemic prevention. Now, it is even more urgent to deal with it.

### United Nations Two-Year Work Review (2)

July 8, Shanghai United Translation

In accordance with the resolution passed by the United Nations General Assembly in the London Conference, the Economic and Social Council established a subcommittee in February to formulate recommendations for the international institutions necessary for reconstruction. The subcommittee's report indicated that the need for reconstruction was enormous. Last autumn, the General Assembly reviewed this report and recommendation at the New York Conference. On March 27, 1947, the Economic and Social Council established two economic committees for Europe and Asia and the Far East. These two regional groups had broad powers to investigate reconstruction issues and consult with governments in the region. The European Economic Commission began its work in Geneva in May, and the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East held its first meeting in Shanghai on June 16.

After the liberation of occupied countries, the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) immediately responded to the relief and rehabilitation needs of war-torn countries. This international organization was scheduled to cease operations in 1947, so the United Nations urgently needed to decide how to continue providing relief to countries still in need. The General Assembly discussed this issue last autumn and agreed that the need for relief was coming to an end and that, although urgent, the problem was only short-term. Therefore, the General Assembly did not establish a new international organization to handle relief matters, but resolved that countries should consult with each other to obtain relief. Soon after, a committee was established to determine the needs of countries requiring relief and the ability of those countries to meet those needs themselves. Over the past five months, the Secretary-General has arranged informal consultations to help countries avoid duplication of their relief plans, while also notifying donor countries of the locations and types of relief needed. On May 23, the Secretary-General requested member state governments to provide more information on relief needs and plans.

During the post-war period, the suffering of countries afflicted by famine was exacerbated by the global food shortage. The food crisis still exists today. At the London Conference, the General Assembly urged governments to take strict measures to help conserve food and increase food production. Last autumn, the General Assembly studied the food situation again in New York and put forward detailed recommendations for governments to adopt in order to reduce the food shortage and allow food to be transported to areas where it was most urgently needed.

In Europe, at least 30 million children are poorly clothed, underfed, and on the verge of starvation. In the Far East, there are just as many, or perhaps even more, children in the same situation. They need food, housing, clothing, and medicine. Last autumn, the General Assembly resolved to establish an International Children's Emergency Fund to provide assistance. This fund is made up of voluntary contributions from governments, organizations, and individuals and is now operational, soon providing a steady stream of food and welfare assistance.

In addition, the United Nations has also drawn up plans to appeal to the world to meet the urgent needs of children, adolescents, and pregnant women. This appeal will benefit the International Children's Emergency Fund and other organizations.

Last autumn, in December, the General Assembly also resolved to take over the social welfare activities of the UNRRA Advisory Social Welfare Services, including child welfare, training social welfare workers, restoring social welfare organizations and groups, assisting the disabled, and coordinating the activities of various volunteer organizations.

United Nations Administered Territories

Although representatives of more than 80 percent of humanity attended the San Francisco Conference, the voices of tens of millions of people living in non-self-governing territories were not directly heard when the Charter was drafted. However, their interests were by no means ignored, and the major powers administering these territories took the lead in formulating the Charter's provisions on the political, economic, and social progress of these peoples, as well as their progress toward self-government or independence. A major body, the Trusteeship Council, has been established to administer or supervise territories entrusted to the United Nations.

However, the Trusteeship Council cannot begin its work until non-self-governing territories are voluntarily handed over to be administered under the new international trusteeship system. The major powers administering non-self-governing territories must submit trusteeship agreements stipulating the conditions for administering non-self-governing territories. These agreements must then be approved by the General Assembly, or by the Security Council if they involve strategic areas. Finally, the Trusteeship Council must wait for the General Assembly to elect its member states, half of which are to be countries administering trust territories and half of which are not.

The General Assembly, meeting in London, called on all countries to fulfill the Charter's provisions in this regard. In the autumn of 1946, the General Assembly, meeting in New York, discussed the draft agreements submitted by member states on the eight mandated territories of the former League of Nations. These drafts were thoroughly reviewed and finally adopted, with the result that Tanganyika, British Cameroons, British Togoland, Ruanda-Urundi, French Cameroons, French Togoland, New Guinea, and Western Somoa were all placed under the international trusteeship system. The General Assembly also elected two additional members to the Trusteeship Council to equalize the number of members administering and not administering trust territories. Currently, the members of the Trusteeship Council are Australia, Belgium, China, France, Iran, Mexico, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, and the United States. This important body convened its first session in March and April 1947.

What is the work of the Trusteeship Council like? The records of the first session, although largely concerned with organizational matters, in fact demonstrated the various main activities of the Trusteeship Council. First, the Trusteeship Council drew up a detailed "Provisional Questionnaire" containing 247 questions covering all aspects of activity in the trust territories. This questionnaire is a form to be used by the countries administering non-self-governing territories to submit annual reports on the progress of the residents of their administered territories for review by the General Assembly, so that all 55 member states can understand how the administering countries are implementing the provisions of the Charter.

Second,

the Trusteeship Council reviewed

dozens of petitions from Tanganyika, issued by German and Italian expatriates who now or formerly resided in the trust territory, requesting the Trusteeship Council to intervene in their deportation back to their countries of origin. Accepting and reviewing these petitions is one of the Trusteeship Council's primary duties. After carefully reviewing the issues raised in the petitions, the Trusteeship Council generally endorsed the British government's policy of deporting undesirable expatriates to their home countries.

Leaders of the Samoan Islands also submitted a petition requesting permission for Samoa to become self-governing and to end the "unnatural division" of the Samoan Islands into American administration and New Zealand trusteeship. The Trusteeship Council unanimously decided to send a fact-finding mission to the area. On July 3, just three weeks after the Trusteeship Council convened its first session, a three-member fact-finding mission set out for Samoa to study what measures the United Nations should take to fulfill the wishes of the people there.

Related to trusteeship, another important event

was the disposal of the Marshall, Caroline, and Mariana Islands, formerly mandated to Japan. These four island groups were extremely important during the Pacific War. On February 17, 1947, the United States government submitted a draft trusteeship agreement for these four island groups, designating them as "strategic areas" under American administration. The draft agreement was discussed by the Security Council, which handles strategic area trusteeship matters. On April 2, the Security Council unanimously adopted the agreement, which is now awaiting approval by the Chinese government. Once approved, the United States will administer these strategic areas under the conditions of the agreement, in accordance with the international trusteeship system.

The provisions of the Charter on the trusteeship system apply to 14 million people in eight trust territories. What about the hundreds of millions of people in non-self-governing territories that have not been placed under the protection of the United Nations? The Charter also has provisions for the interests of these people, requiring member states responsible for administering these territories to regularly report to the Secretary-General on the economic, social, and educational conditions in those areas.

The United Nations originally had 51 member states. At the second session of the first General Assembly in 1946, Afghanistan, Iceland, Siam, and Sweden were admitted as new member states, bringing the total to 55. Last November, the General Assembly recommended to the Security Council that it re-examine the applications for membership submitted by Albania, Ireland, Outer Mongolia, Portugal, and Transjordan. Subsequently, Hungary and Italy also applied for membership. The Security Council's Committee on Admission of New Members will examine these applications. Currently, the Security Council and various committees of the General Assembly are jointly drafting new rules for the procedure for applying for membership for new member states.

Refugees and Trade Issues

The Second World War created nearly a million refugees and displaced persons who still live in refugee camps in Germany and other locations in Europe. At its initial meetings in January 1946, the General Assembly paid attention to the seriousness of this problem. Before the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration and the Intergovernmental Committee on Refugees cease operations, there must be an appropriate way to settle these wartime refugees.

### Reader Consultation

Legal Interpretation

(1) Pledge Issues

Wu He asks: Legal provisions state that for any term pledge, if it is not redeemed upon expiration, the pledgor loses the right of redemption after three years. If the above overdue situation occurs, should the pledgee directly file a report with the local court, or wait for the pledgor to redeem before processing?

[Lawyer Fu Kuang replies] If the pledgor does not redeem at the original pledge price after two years have passed from the expiration of the pledge, the pledgee obtains ownership of the pledged item. To complete this procedure: (1) The original pledge agreement and the pledgor's attached title deed must be sent to the Land Administration Bureau for transfer of ownership registration and payment of deed tax. (2) Registration of ownership of the real estate with the court does not require litigation proceedings.

(2) Forced Eviction

Kuai Yixin asks: The old house where I live has two rooms and has been inhabited for more than 20 years. Recently, a house dispute arose due to a change of ownership. Please advise: (1) If the landlord uses the excuse of not collecting rent for three months to reclaim the house, can the tenant propose to the landlord to sign a lease agreement and request to continue living there (there was no lease agreement in the past)? (2) If there is no lease agreement and the landlord orders the tenant to move out, is it illegal to refuse to move out? (3) What should be done if the landlord uses coercion to force eviction? (4) If the landlord forces the tenant to move out simply to increase income, what should be done if the landlord intends to increase the rent?

[Lawyer Cao Yaxia replies] (1) It is not necessary to propose a lease agreement. Since the lease was not established in writing, it is regarded as a lease with no fixed term. As for the landlord not collecting rent, it should be deposited according to law. (2) As long as the lease is legal, it does not violate the law. (3) You should file a lawsuit for relief according to the law. The landlord cannot force eviction by coercion. (4) If the landlord needs the tenant to compensate for repairs to the house, and if the amount is not large, it is advisable to give it a little in the current circumstances, in order to settle the matter and appease the person.

### Telecommunications Q&A Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau Business Department Answers

[Yonghe Industrial Company, Tokyo Road asks] Our company intends to send codes to branch companies in Nanjing, Hankou, and Tianjin to transmit business messages. What are the procedures for registering these codes? (Answer) There is no registration procedure for code telegrams. All business offices of this bureau can accept them. The price is 2,000 yuan per Chinese code word, and 2,000 yuan per English word, regardless of whether it is clear or coded.

[Huang Yiqing, Dafeng Firm, Zhonghua Road asks] (1) What is the shortest time for an ordinary telegram and an express telegram to Hanjiang to be delivered? (Answer) An ordinary telegram takes about ten hours to arrive, and an express telegram takes five hours. (2) What are the hours for night letter telegrams? (Answer) Night letter telegrams are accepted at any time, but the transmission time must be after 7:00 PM. (3) Are there express night letter telegrams? (Answer) No. (4) Can a night letter telegram to Hanjiang be delivered by noon the next day? (Answer) Night letter telegrams to Hanjiang have not yet been opened.

[Zhu Cailiang, Huangnong Road asks] (1) Applying for a phone line transfer is slow due to the slow exchange of official documents. Can this accumulation of habits be eliminated? (Answer) The application for a phone line transfer must be stamped with the original seal of the user and accompanied by documents proving that the transfer is for self-use. The bureau will send personnel to investigate and verify before the transfer can be processed. However, some users are unaware of the above regulations, which inevitably leads to delays in the procedure. As for the elimination, it is temporarily impossible in order to prevent unauthorized substitution. (2) At night, when making long-distance calls or reporting phone line repairs, there is often no one in charge. Why? (Answer) If there is no response when calling for a long-distance call at night, please call the bureau's number 61443 or the Shanghai Telephone Company's number 42678 to inform the operator of the time, and we will investigate and reply. If a telephone malfunction occurs at night, you can call the 101 telephone measuring station to report the repair. If there is a case of irresponsibility, you can also write a letter to the bureau stating the facts and time, and we will investigate it.

[Li Simi, Fanhua Dulu asks] Why is it more difficult to register for a China-America wireless call than a long-distance call? (Answer) According to the provisional opening locations for China-America wireless calls, they are currently limited to Beijing and Shanghai. However, due to the insufficient number of communication circuits and time, channeling them is difficult, resulting in a congested phenomenon in outbound call records. In order to maintain a balance between the record and the call, it is necessary to limit the number of telephone registrations each month. Moreover, frequent military and government communications between China and the United States should be connected in advance according to regulations, which affects the registration of ordinary users. Currently, the number of requests for registration exceeds the telephone's capacity. The bureau is currently seeking improvements.

[Substitute Mail] Mr. Zhang Yingjing, Tangqi: Your letter has been forwarded to the Nanjing Second District Telecommunications Administration for an answer.

Spring and Autumn

### Mezzanine Ramblings

— Mei Lin

He is a section chief, a man with considerable talent in social affairs; therefore, he dresses very carefully, wearing a pullover suit, patterned leather shoes, a fifty-one type gold pen, an automatic swimming luminous watch, and a diamond ring, just like a diplomat. He says "haha" three times every five sentences; after eating, he covers his lips with his palm to pick his teeth, his demeanor is completely upper class. But he has a bad habit, habitually spitting thick phlegm from his nose out of his mouth. This is considered the most terrible thing by hygienists, more disgusting than holding phlegm and not spitting when listening to others. When I pointed out to him this bad habit that could make his girlfriend turn her head and leave, he laughed loudly and said:

"This is very common. Many great people spit in the same way." Then, with a laugh, he told a joke: "Women will never turn their heads and leave because you spit thick phlegm from your mouth, it doesn't matter if you are covered in fox odor or have other bad smells. As long as you have a great aura and dress luxuriously. For example, if you are wearing a pullover suit worth millions of yuan, and you curl your lips arrogantly and fiercely, women will throw flirtatious glances at you. You, old brother, only pay attention to small details, not big scenes. Ha, ha, ha."

This may be his experience, not purely a joke. I don't need to be surprised, what I am surprised by is his explanation and supplement to the "spitting method".

"In fact, spitting depends on each person's habits. It is certainly wonderful to cover your mouth and nose with a handkerchief to cough up, but the thought of having some slippery phlegm in your pocket is really uncomfortable. Pinching your nose with your fingers and flicking it? It's like a country bumpkin, very ugly. Only spitting out both phlegm and mucus from the mouth at the same time is the simplest. Many people adopt this "spitting method" not by chance, there is a great reason for it, ha, ha, ha."

I had to open my eyes wide and stare at his smug face, and I couldn't help but marvel.

He talked about the spitting method, about the "philosophy of following". According to him, human history is a history of "following", the followers following the generals, the generals following the emperor; thus success and failure, rise and fall, are acting out "historical dramas". The so-called knowledge is only useful if it is applicable to "following", otherwise to hell with it. He said that the reason why he was able to wear a pullover suit worth millions of yuan was because he "followed". He will continue to "follow" until he has a car, a foreign house, and a concubine.

I fell into deep thought, I seemed to see a "great person" growing up.

In Huangjiacun, people with the surname Huang lived together in a clan. They were living in houses left behind by their ancestors. They were fighting over and damaging the few public courtyards belonging to each house.

So, the following happened:

Aunt Huang washed her face and splashed the water into the courtyard, and the dirty mud immediately splashed everywhere, many splashes landed on Aunt San's chicken coop.

Aunt Huang San immediately turned pale and cursed:

"Are you blind? Splashing face water randomly!"

Aunt Huang could not bear it and retorted:

"I just want to splash it, the courtyard is public, what's it to you!"

So they cursed at each other, cursing to the point of white heat. Uncle Huang San could not bear the anger and came to help curse, while Big Brother Huang naturally could not let his wife fight alone.

"You stinking thing! Cursing a few more words, I'll break your dog legs!"

Big Brother Huang stared with big eyes like a yellow cow and replied fiercely for his wife;

"You castrated bull! You deserve to be slaughtered; if you have the ability, let's fight!"

Uncle Huang San really found a hoe and went straight at Big Brother Huang; Big Brother Huang then grabbed a carrying pole. So, the two sides danced at each other, and a war broke out.

"They're fighting again! Why bother? Alas!"

Uncle Huang, who lived next door, came over to mediate. He had a head full of "neutrality" and a belly full of "peace"; but in his home, because of the public courtyard, the younger generation who had separated from the family often quarreled with him.

The war stopped, but the infighting intensified greatly, and the dirty mud water in the courtyard increased every day. Everyone held this principle:

— If your chicken coop can be placed in the courtyard to poop, so can mine; if you throw things into the courtyard, don't think I won't do the same? Hmph! The courtyard is public!

So, this courtyard became a stinking pit, flies and infectious germs bred there, and the dirty mud water, exposed to the scorching sun in June, evaporated a smell even stronger than ammonia.

Aunt Huang's precious Ah Fu suddenly fell ill, didn't want to eat, didn't want to drink, was always feverish, and talked nonsense. Aunt Huang was so anxious that she called on the bodhisattva, but Aunt Huang San was secretly saying:

"Good! You deserve it!"

But when Aunt Huang's precious Ah Fu was about to die, Aunt Huang San's darling Gui Cai also fell ill, also with a fever, talking nonsense, exactly like Ah Fu's symptoms.

Aunt Huang San no longer gloated, and her heart was also anxiously beating wildly. At the same time, all the people in the village, young and old, heard the news about this plague? This was truly a "natural disaster"!

Uncle Huang had experience and hurriedly went to find old men of his age. After frowning and discussing, they decided to follow the ancient method of "suppressing the disaster".

Auspicious day on the Yellow Calendar was chosen. They built a blessing altar at Fang Niu Ping. A Bodhisattva was brought from San Sheng Temple and placed on the blessing altar for worship. Several shaven-headed monks, wearing cassocks, were knocking on wooden fish and chanting sutras there.

Incense smoke curled up, paper ashes flew around, and the Bodhisattva sat solemnly, but with eyes closed. An endless stream of Huang descendants went to kowtow, seeming very pious.

Uncle Huang San and his wife came back from the blessing altar with dirty heads, praying in their hearts that their darling Gui Cai's illness would get better. On the way, Aunt Huang San saw many large pieces of yellow paper with black characters pasted on the wall. She hurriedly asked her husband what they meant. Uncle Huang San piously read:

"Clan members, start eating vegetarian food!"

"Go to the blessing altar to kowtow sincerely!"

"Support the Bodhisattva to eliminate the plague!"

"Long live the Bodhisattva!"

### Summer in Beidaihe

— Yi Feng

Last summer was the most leisurely summer of my life. As the pomegranate flowers were just beginning to turn red on the branches, my family from Fujian went to Beidaihe to escape the summer heat, or perhaps it could be said, to escape trouble! We rented three bungalows in Dabohezhai, choosing it for its proximity to the sea and the tranquility of rural life. With nothing to do during the long summer days, we had plenty of leisure, plenty of freedom, and the opportunity to travel together as a family. How could I forget this summer?

In the early morning, a window of morning light shone through the sparse peach branches in the backyard, and the tomatoes, corn, and sunflowers in the garden were all glistening with morning dew, vibrant and green. I busied myself watering and weeding, grooming this little enclosure for a while, then took the children along the broad path of the fields, walking up and down the undulating mountain trails. Along the way, we picked wildflowers, summer chrysanthemums, wild asters, mountain azaleas, rock narcissus, and other nameless mountain blossoms, filling the little girls' hair and lapels. Below the mountain, the waves of wheat rippled in the wind, like a young girl's soft hair just beginning to show a touch of charming ripples. In the distance, the majestic peaks beyond Shanhaiguan guarded the strategic pass, arranged like a protective screen, hidden in the clouds and mist. Sometimes, one could vaguely make out the dragon-like Great Wall, as if it were boasting of its historical greatness and glory. Looking closer, the east and west mountains were densely dotted with villas of various styles and colors, with the serenity of the villas peeking through the lush greenery, like fresh blossoms blooming among green branches and leaves, or like countless colorful embroideries woven onto a green velvet carpet.

Coming down the mountain and out of Liuzhuang, we were at the seaside. The sea breeze and waves were playing a rhythmic and magnificent music, delighting the children so much that they danced and shouted in unison, "Ah! The magnificent sea!" The younger ones sat on the beach, picking up seashells and building pyramids of fine sand, while the older ones ran into the sea, chasing and playing with the waves. I lay naked on the beach, silently facing the sea and sky, looking up at the few white clouds, freely drifting and unfurling. Suddenly, I heard the children in the sea waving and calling for me to join them, so I plunged into the embrace of the sea with them, washing away the dirt and grime from my body and mind, feeling light, refreshed, and almost like an immortal. Clear mountains and green waters are inherently welcoming to all, but those who are caught up in the pursuit of fame and fortune, indulging in air-conditioned comfort, can only blame themselves for distancing themselves from nature and forgetting nature. This disordered world makes it seem as if there is nothing to enjoy!

Among the four seasons, spring only offers intoxicating temptation, autumn hints at feelings of decline and sadness, and winter is especially harsh and threatening to the poor. Only summer, with its light and warmth, encourages people and is willing to give the poor more opportunities to connect with nature. To show our gratitude for summer's generosity, we should accept its gifts!

As the setting sun sinks in the west, the summer heat completely dissipates. All the children, including myself, still linger, reluctant to return, until the sky is filled with stars.

Sparse and scattered village lights, along with shepherds and fishermen, head home on the same path.

Lu You wrote in his poem, "Occasionally I call for a fast horse to greet the new moon, but instead I board a light carriage to enjoy the evening breeze." This was Lu You's leisure when he was an official. Although I have no fast horse to ride or light carriage to sit in, I hold my soaking wet bathing suit in one hand and my shoes in the other, walking barefoot on the rustling sandy beach, with the waves constantly washing over my ankles, which is also quite a unique and interesting experience!

Being barefoot and half-naked is very common in Beidaihe. Women can wear bathing suits and walk around freely and comfortably on the streets, everyone equally sharing the natural life of the countryside.

Beidaihe is the summer girl of the North, but she possesses the charm of a Western beauty and the graceful posture of a Jiangnan maiden. However, after being away for a year, she is now resting amidst the surrounding fires of war. How can I not care about her safety?

### Flowers and Trees

— Qing Guo

Yang Locust Trees

A long road lined with Yang locust trees on both sides looks beautiful enough.

Looking from afar, it's like a tunnel formed by two green walls. The turning points seem to hide endless tranquility and mystery, and a sense of remoteness will tickle your heart. Walking there, you will forget your fatigue, you will lose your ability to calculate distances and stop your steps, just like pursuing a hope, just moving forward.

Several times, I thought, suppose there was a girl in green gauze under the Yang locust tree, our passionate singing and burning loving eyes flowing through the branches and leaves, melting together...

Several times, I thought, suppose there was a red lantern under the Yang locust tree, slowly floating from the dark night waves, accompanied by wanton laughter and light footsteps...

To be honest, I like Yang locust trees very much.

I wonder how vast it would be to have a green dream under the Yang locust trees.

Now the flowers of the Yang locust tree are blooming again, and the road is filled with an intoxicating fragrance.

I strolled, stepping on fallen flowers, stepping on fragrance; I was thinking of a person, a story...

I wish I had a real green dream, and one that was covered in Yang locust flowers.

Rose

Outside the window is a small garden.

When dawn brushes away the dream shadows pressing on my eyelids, a light fragrance gently caresses my face.

I know that the roses that have crept over from the night are blooming again.

The rose is under the window, and when I open the window, it is the first thing that jumps into view. It will tether my gaze, letting the blooming flowers and the unopened buds both be knotted in my sight before letting me look at the trees and grass that form a green curtain.

On the table, I have a pitifully small vase with roses in it. Every day, I diligently change the water and enthusiastically change the flowers; the water that has been changed is poured at the base of the rose bush under the window, and the wilting flowers that have been changed are also thrown at the base of the rose bush under the window.

Sometimes, I also feel a little sad: don't the dead flowers also have an unforgettable past? However, the newly born flowers are decorating a beautiful future.

One day, a few children ran into my room and snatched the roses in the vase, leaving me only a dying flower.

But they all smiled happily, each with a rose in their mouth, and said to me:

"These are ours."

Just as I was about to go forward to snatch them back, they all swallowed the flowers.

Then, roses bloomed on their faces and mouths, blooming so brightly and brilliantly.

### Poems by Fan Jun of Xiangxi

— Zhu Wen

The prose of Fan Jun of Xiangxi is abrupt, vigorous, and clear, establishing him as a master in his own right, but his poems lack originality. However, the chapter on Listening to the Qin says: "The listeners all hear the qin, but may not know the qin's sound. Acquaintances fill the eyes, but may not know the heart. Knowing sound is like Ziqi, knowing heart is like Bao Shu. This way has long been desolate, who can follow their high footsteps? Ancient sounds should not be played again, ancient hearts are only for self-pity; only the moon and dew know the sound, only Heaven knows me. Do you not see, today's human feelings are as thin as paper, today's worldly paths are as treacherous as streams. Hmph, such things are not worth discussing, the traces of birds are faint, passing through the vastness." It uniquely expresses a deep sigh.

### Aphorisms on Poetry

— Wei Yong

Poetry is the sound of feelings expressed with color.

So-called poetry is the art of arranging words – it is also the art of using words to create an illusion in the mind.

Poetry is [unclear] character.

It is music of thought, woven by [unclear] real [unclear].

Poetry is the record of the mind that prioritizes career at its highest and most [unclear] moment.

Poetry is the words of profound, sincere and true truth.

Writing poetry is choosing the best fruit.

Poetry is the recollection of emotions in their state of tranquility.

In the creation of poetry, the representation of words accounts for one-tenth, and the other nine-tenths is the reflection of your life. Poetry is the resonance of emotions.

### Young Bullfighter

— Manet

Manet (Edouard Manet 1832-1883) was the precursor to Impressionism. As a youth, he studied under T. Couture, but dissatisfied with his teacher's dull style, he sought his own path and engaged in studying impressionistic techniques. In 1863, he submitted "Le Déjeuner sur l'herbe" to the Salon, but was unfortunately rejected. Thereupon, he invited young artists of similar style who had also been rejected to hold a joint "Exhibition of Rejected Artists." Although they were ridiculed by the general literati of the time, they established a new theory of painting regardless.

The characteristic of his style is the pursuit of outdoor light and the capture of the impression of things in a flash. The name "Impressionism" was thus derived. Representative works include "Olympia," "Le Déjeuner sur l'herbe," etc. (Liu Shi)

### One Inch of Mountains and Rivers, One Inch of Blood 349

— Ye Jingfeng

I did a quick calculation and asked Dingyuan: "You and Miss Yaoqun have no agreed place or method for seeing each other again?" I decided to go to Shuangyi Bridge too.

"She said she would come find me, but she didn't specify a time. She already memorized my location... it's the same place where Captain Sun met me in the evening..." Dingyuan said, glancing at the big guy standing beside him, revealing a hint of a smile.

"How did you meet Mr. Wu?" I looked at "Zero Four."

"Reporting to the Chief Secretary, I didn't meet Mr. Wu... Mr. Wu met me, rushing to call me Captain Sun; I was startled and didn't recognize any monk. Later Mr. Wu said, 'I am Wu Dingyuan, the engineer from Changxindian, and now I have become a monk!' Then, I looked carefully and realized it really was Engineer Wu... and he returned the pistol to me."

I was just about to tell Dingyuan and Da Shazi that we were preparing to leave for Shuangyi Bridge to inquire about Yaoqun's whereabouts when another telegram arrived. This was from "Zero Twelve" in Tokyo:

"Confirmed. KCC will reach Ping within two days, please prepare for all senior staff to meet and discuss; urgent."

The word "Confirmed" refers to the content of the previous secret telegram; KCC is a code name for Tsurumi. The previous telegram reported Tsurumi's experiences in Tokyo over the past two days, which were dangerous and complex; because he took advantage of the special circumstances of "training" to redeploy the search for "Seven Secret Letters," this move was almost discovered by the joint front of the German Fifth Column and the Matsu Group cadres. But finally, Tsurumi and Pingzi's group discovered another new route; now they are preparing to unite all their troops and W Jun's subordinates to carry out large-scale work in Guanyang, what kind of work is not specified, only saying "continued disclosure," and also saying that KCC plans to fly to Ping within two or three days and is arranging the "route."

According to my guess, this "work" seems to be unrelated to the "Secret Letters," perhaps referring to formally breaking up with the Matsu Group and fighting them, otherwise why go to Shenyang, why gather all the troops and unite with W Jun's subordinates? But there is no way to inquire about the meaning of the word "work" from "Zero Twelve": With the habit of exchanging secret messages, whenever there is a question that is not fully understood, or when the time has not yet come to publish the question, I always use the three words "continued disclosure" to indicate that the other party does not need to ask further, as asking would be useless.

I immediately relayed the contents of these two telegrams to W Jun's headquarters in Beiping, and also briefly told Dingyuan and "Zero Four," and ordered "Zero Four" to prepare writing materials; in any case, Dingyuan had to return to his "residence" that night, so we could just send him back and then go inquire about Yaoqun's whereabouts. I believe there is no more important matter than this at present. I also told "Zero Four" to tell Liu Wu to pay attention to receiving the report at four o'clock in the morning.

But my plan was opposed by Dingyuan and "Zero Four." They believed that it was already past midnight, and I, as the acting chief of the general team, should be stationed at the radio station, and should also rest a little. Another reason was that my personal movements were more likely to attract attention – assuming that someone was already paying attention! It was best to remain still. Moreover, "Zero Four" could go to any place I wanted to go, and "Zero Four" could also act on my behalf in inquiring about things; he was even more familiar with the route than I was, because of his daytime experience. The last reason was that although Liu Wu said he could receive reports, it was limited to mechanical work; in case he encountered a problem that needed to be solved immediately, he would be unable to do it.

### Prices Fall!

— Shilang

Prices are generally falling, and this is something that has been happening in recent months.

It's like a whirlwind and torrential rain suddenly blowing in the middle of a scorching heat.

This whirlwind and torrential rain explains a few things: (1) The special envoy Wei [unclear] from the United States has already departed from the United States. His arrival indicates that the United States is actively assisting China, and China's economic situation will transition into a new stage. (2) Sino-Japanese trade is about to resume, and Japanese goods are coming immediately. Japan's wartime industry has not been damaged, and its costs are much lower than China's. (3) In the past two days, credit has been tight, and commercial firms have had to throw out goods in order to absorb cash.

So you see: rice has almost retreated into the 400,000 range; rayon is plummeting; Chinese stocks are falling to the limit; cotton cloth and cooking oil are also declining, and even the black market for gold and currency has to retreat in the face of this trend.

Falling prices are always a good sign for small citizens, but for industry and commerce, it is a serious signal! During these times, because prices were rising, the chips of industry and commerce were all placed on the "speculation" gambling table, because that could give them even thicker interest margins. One turn of the hand could immediately bring in tens of millions or hundreds of millions, but when the basic factors of these speculative markets completely disappear, that is, if China's economic situation truly transitions into a stable stage, the black market for gold and currency will no longer be a black market, and cotton cloth and rayon will plummet due to the dumping of Japanese goods, then, I ask you, the industrial and commercial magnates who are keen on "speculation," what will you do?

This is not a beautiful prediction. Sino-Japanese trade will soon be implemented, and Wedemeyer will soon bring economic aid to China. Our industrial and commercial magnates, you should see how others are restoring production. Now is no longer the time to stay on the "speculation" gambling table, turning clouds and overturning rain.

Free Talk

### America, Soviet Union, Korea

— Meng Ping

After Japan surrendered, the United States and the Soviet Union occupied Korea according to the Potsdam Agreement, with the US in the South and the Soviet Union in the North, each going its own way, and political, economic, and cultural development followed their respective主張.

Probably both sides realized that this approach was not right, so they agreed to form a US-Soviet Joint Committee, wanting to unite North and South Korea to establish a Korean provisional government. Negotiations were progressing smoothly last month, but today's newspaper reports that US General Brown issued a condemnation of the Soviet Union's use of its veto power, causing a stalemate, and the establishment of the Korean provisional government may be stillborn.

In 1884 (the tenth year of the Guangxu reign), during the Kim Ok-gyun incident, a pro-Japanese cabinet was formed in Korea. Yuan Shikai quelled the unrest, and Japan sent troops to Korea, forcing Korea to sign the Treaty of Seoul in January 1885 (the eleventh year of Guangxu). On April 18 of the same year, Ito Hirobumi and Li Hongzhang signed the Treaty of Tianjin, withdrawing Chinese and Japanese troops stationed in Korea. In 1894 (the twentieth year of Guangxu), the Tonghak Peasant Revolution broke out in Korea, and both countries sent troops to quell it, leading to the Sino-Japanese War. In 1895 (the twenty-first year of Guangxu), China and Japan signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, making Korea nominally independent and transferring diplomatic relations to Japan alone. In the same year, Russia, Germany, and France intervened, returning the Liaodong Peninsula, and China withdrew, with Russia officially taking the stage, and the Sino-Japanese contest for Korea turned into a Russo-Manchurian competition.

In 1904 (the thirtieth year of Guangxu), the Russo-Japanese War began, and Russia was defeated. In 1905 (the thirty-first year of Guangxu), Russia and Japan signed the Treaty of Portsmouth, with Russia ceding all its rights in Southern Manchuria, obtained from China, to Japan. After the end of World War I, Russia underwent revolution, and Japan rose to become one of the five great powers. After the September 18th Incident in Manchuria, the Japanese created the puppet state of "Manchukuo," and Russian influence in Manchuria was completely expelled, with Japan dominating Korea and Manchuria. Two years ago, at the end of World War II, the Soviet Union regained and even surpassed its Tsarist Russian influence in Manchuria and Korea, and Korea became a battleground for US-Soviet occupation.

Sixty years ago, the protagonists vying for Korea were China and Japan. Sixty years later, although the protagonists vying for Korea cannot be said to be the US and the Soviet Union, the two countries have different ideologies, and their occupation and governance policies are inconsistent. If this continues for a long time, the boundaries will become increasingly clear. General Wedemeyer recently came to inspect China and Korea, and after seeing the current state of Korea and the situation in Northeast China, he will prepare a report in the future. I wonder what the White House master will do?

We are thinking for the sake of the US and Korea, we are thinking for the sake of Korea, hoping that the US-Soviet negotiated Korean government will be established immediately, and that the US and the Soviet Union will withdraw from Korea; at the same time, we hope that the Soviet Union will abide by the Sino-Soviet Treaty, so that the situation in Korea and Manchuria can be clarified and that the US and the Soviet Union will not stage the old drama of China-Japan and Russo-Japanese conflicts.

### Good and Evil in Human Nature

— Zhuo Sheng

There are many incredible things in the world, and there are also many non-unique things in the world. The former is the manifestation of metaphysics and ghosts, and the latter is the representation of the scientific spirit.

During the Warring States period, Mencius and Xunzi of China each guarded a solid fortress, resisting and attacking each other. Mencius's fortress was the goodness of human nature, and Xunzi's fortress was the evil of human nature. It was difficult to determine the winner, and so it remains to this day. Although they are both dead, the two fortresses are still guarded by their disciples who inherit their teachings.

In sixteenth-century France, the same thing happened. François Rabelais and John Calvin were both representatives of the academic world at the time. Rabelais said: Human nature is good. Calvin said: Human nature is evil. His doctrine of the evil of human nature had an unparalleled emphasis and sharp theory. The two can be said to be powerful disputants about the soul during the Renaissance: Rabelais regarded God as a compassionate manager of the universe, while Calvin regarded God as an impartial judge.

Although the periods were one before the other, research from a historical perspective shows that Rabelais and Calvin were not influenced by Xunzi's remarks at all, but completely came from themselves. This kind of academic "ten thousand miles of predestined connection without a line," "a match made in heaven," is precisely an incredible thing.

Rabelais's value is very shaky today; Calvin is still respected as a great figure with the highest ideals. Old Master Meng was fortunate, and the East is different from the West after all, and China is different from France after all.

Flying Saucers

Flying disc craze makes noise abroad, I am also bewitched by flying saucers! Disc and saucer are originally the same, thought to be tableware inseparable from eating?

Eating is what we boast as number one! Perhaps a wonderful food flies here? No sight of flying cups and guests, sitting among flowers, drunk on the moon, competing in fists!

Note: "Fists" refers to Qingquan.

### The Beitashan Incident

— Pu Lun

Including Geographic and Ethnic Factors

Beitashan is in the northeast of Xinjiang, close to the west of Mongolia, and is a hilly mountain range with an altitude of around 1,000 meters. This area is sparsely populated, with hundreds of miles of fertile grassland, belonging to the Junggar Basin. The basin is located at a very high latitude and is extremely far from the sea, so the difference between hot and cold is extreme, and rainfall is scarce, forming a dry area. Therefore, animal husbandry has replaced agriculture; but agriculture is not undeveloped. Most of the residents are Han Chinese, who are not accustomed to animal husbandry and have to engage in agriculture, making the area the largest grain-producing area in the North. In addition to animal husbandry and agriculture, the area also produces minerals such as gold, petroleum, and uranium. To the east of Beitashan is a large sand desert called the Gurbantunggut Desert. Because the light in this desert is easily refracted, parallax often occurs. At night, the starlight feels particularly bright, and during the day, distant mountains and forests seem to be right in front of you, hence the saying, "Gazing at the mountain tires the horse to death, taking things is a vague question." Because the area bordering Outer Mongolia is quite long, with only the Altai Mountains in between, the Altai Mountains stretch from northwest to southeast, from [Zha Ke] to the Junggar region on the north side of the Tianshan Mountains. The flat sands stretch as far as the eye can see, with no high mountains or large rivers to defend, and the people living in this area are all nomadic peoples. This is the geographic factor in the Beitashan Incident.

Beitashan is only 900 li away from Dihua, the capital of Xinjiang Province. If Beitashan is not defended, enemy cavalry could advance 300 li south and occupy Qitai County, which lies between Hami and Dihua, cutting off the only route from Xinjiang Province to Lanzhou. Xinjiang Province's international transportation route west from Yining to the Soviet Union, and the two routes from Hotan to India, have long been closed; the only route to the interior passes through Lanzhou, Jiuquan, Lixingxia, Hami, Zhenxi, Qitai, and Dihua, a total length of about 4,000 li. Qitai is the trade hub of this route, as well as the commercial center of the entire province, and more importantly, a strategic military location.

The southern end of the Soviet Central Asian heavy industrial heartland, the U.K.K. area of Karaganda, is only 500 nautical miles from Tacheng in Xinjiang, and the huge steel and coal industrial area of Stalinsk in the Kuznetsk Basin is only 400 nautical miles from Chenghua Temple in Altai.

The Tianshan Mountains, which run across Xinjiang, divide the province into northern and southern parts. The protruding tip of the northern part is the Altai Mountains mentioned above, where Kazakhs and Mongolian nomadic people live. It is the base of past disturbances in Xinjiang Province and a place coveted by foreigners. In the past decade or so, no incident in Xinjiang has not originated in the Altai Mountains. The Altai Mountains are the fifth administrative region in northeastern Xinjiang Province. The district government was initially located in Chenghua. The Altai region has a vast area, rich mineral resources, and a population of 63,040 people, of whom 53,352 are Kazakhs, accounting for about 75 percent. Others include Han Chinese, Uyghurs, Hui people, Kyrgyz people, and Mongolians. The Kazakhs and Uyghurs were the main actors in the Yining Incident, due to their large population and their hostility towards the Han people. These people cherish a deep feeling of yearning for their motherland, but also harbor a long-standing feeling of disappointment, and cannot help but turn to [foreign country]'s embrace; they have obtained Soviet citizenship and become people with dual nationalities, which is so painful! The Kazakhs were originally called Turkestan. The so-called "East Turkestan Republic" in the past was also instigated by the Uyghurs and Kazakhs, thus leading to the "Yining Incident." Now, the flags and insignia of the "East Turkestan" government can be seen everywhere. Yes, the phenomena of the "East Turkestan" era not only still exist in the three districts of Yining, Tacheng, and the Altai Mountains, but have also moved to Dihua. In addition, the Mongolians are also worth noting; because the Mongolian people had a period of considerable influence ruling Xinjiang, and there are still 150,000 people of Mongolian origin remaining in Xinjiang, scattered in Yanqi District, Tacheng District, Yili District, Altai District, Usu District, etc. Because their number is smaller than other ethnic groups, conflicts with other ethnic groups may be unavoidable.

The ethnic composition of Xinjiang is very complex, and the Altai Mountain region is even more so.

### Miscellany from America

Dancing Education in America

Education in a broad sense is not limited to rote learning, to being bogged down in books, or to dying by books; rather, it encompasses everything and lacks nothing. Therefore, American-style education includes sex education talks, atomic energy talks, and dance training. Besides each university having a dance course dedicated to teaching stage performance dance, there are also many specialized dance schools. These schools are generally quite large in scale. When I was in Houston, I visited Abe's Dancing School. It was located upstairs, with shops below. You walked up the stairs from the side door directly to the principal's office. From the principal's office, you could access the dance floor and dressing room. The dance floor was very large, even larger than the dance floors of professional dance halls in Shanghai. And this dance school was not the largest in Houston. The dance floor was surrounded by large glass mirrors, so beginners could see their postures. It could accommodate forty or fifty couples dancing. The tuition fee was divided into two types: single lessons were two dollars per half hour, payable each time or in full for a term. Paying once counted as one lesson, but if you made an appointment and didn't show up, it still counted as one lesson. Group lessons were one dollar each time, and group dances were held twice a week, practically like holding a dance party. The head teachers were the principal and his wife, and talented students served as teaching assistants, all of whom were high school girls aged seventeen or eighteen. They were not only patient and encouraging but also considerate in every detail. On the third floor, there was a class dedicated to teaching stage performance dance and Russian dance. The students all took off their outer garments, leaving only triangular briefs and bras. Along the window was a handrail about two zhang long. Beginners held onto the rail with one hand, so they could practice raising their legs without wobbling. Powders chests and legs, a wonderful movie setting. This is extremely effective for various dance skills, guaranteeing success. The instruction is extremely strict. Those learning stage performance dance must practice diligently for at least two hours each day, dancing until they are covered in sweat and panting heavily. Americans consider dancing to be a wonderful way to stay healthy, not just an art form. And the beauty of American women lies in the beauty of their legs, which are longer and stronger than those of Eastern women, largely due to dancing. Chinese women lack proper exercise. Those who are congenitally deficient are often melancholic and prone to illness, like Lin Daiyu. Some who are pampered and well-off become grotesquely obese, like water buffaloes. I oppose using dancing as a tool for profit, but I support using dancing as a department of aesthetic education. (23)

### Summer Records by the Light of a Firefly Window

— Fengren

Different Tunes, Same Melody

I happened to read a passage in "Worries of Weilu" (畏廬瑣記), which records a story about Liu Xiaoyi (劉孝議):

"Liu Xiaolian (劉孝廉), whose name is omitted, claimed to be unfortunate in marriage. After his wife died, Liu wrote a poem: 'Let our karmic bond not be mistaken in the next life; may we meet again in this life's dreams.' At night, he would embrace his wife's wooden tablet as he slept and woke. He also made a small wooden tablet of his wife, with a small ivory pendant, hanging it on his chest. Every time he spoke, he would mention his wife. After a while, people became quite tired of hearing it, and Liu himself became despondent. One day, a friend visited Liu's house, thinking that Liu must be sleeping alone since he had lost his wife. He pushed aside the curtains to check his bed, only to find him sleeping in the same bed with the maidservant. The wooden tablet was under the bed. The friend laughed loudly."

It seems to me that the so-called "hypocrite" is probably this kind of person. On the surface, they are perfectly benevolent and righteous, like true gentlemen, but secretly they have many unspeakable deeds. I remember the story of the "Filial Son's Archway" (孝子坊) at South Ping Mountain (南屏山) in Hangzhou, which has a similar melody. It is recorded as follows:

"Initially, the filial son mourned his mother's death, shutting himself in his room in grief. Every time he cried, flocks of birds would gather, and this continued undiminished for three years. As the birds gathered in increasing numbers, the neighbors were astonished by his extraordinary filial piety. The county official petitioned for him to be commended, and the emperor granted him a "Filial Son's Archway." The entire county marveled at this revival of ancient virtues. But the filial son continued to shut himself in and mourn as before. Some doubters, disbelieving, peeked through his door one day while he was crying. They saw the filial son walking in the courtyard, crying and scattering rice. The birds heard the sound of his crying and knew they would get food, so they flocked together by the thousands. The person then laughed loudly. Because the crying caused confusion and strangeness, the filial son moved away, but the stone archway remains to this day, recording the filial son's story."

This play is indeed very brilliant. This filial son certainly had an immense theatrical talent. Liu Xiaolian should feel ashamed of himself in comparison. In fact, these kinds of hypocrites are not limited to Liu Xiaolian and a few others. However, because their techniques are more sophisticated and their methods are more clever, everyone has been deceived, and they are regarded as mirrors of brilliance. If someone were to tear through their facade and expose them, I am afraid that hatred of truth would be worth nothing!

### General Overview of the Antarctic

— Ning Xuren

In the world we humans inhabit, in addition to the five continents of Asia, America, Europe, Africa, and Oceania, there is also Antarctica. We can see both poles and the eastern and western hemispheres of the Earth on the terrestrial globe. The upper end is the Arctic, and the lower end is the Antarctic. Most of Antarctica is within the Antarctic Circle, spanning both the eastern and western hemispheres. It was only recently discovered and can be called the newest continent.

Antarctica is farther from the places where humans live than the Arctic, so exploration began hundreds of years later than that of the Arctic. In 1773, Cook circumnavigated the Antarctic, and the following year discovered South Georgia and the Sandwich Islands, becoming the first person to explore the Antarctic. In the early 19th century, successors emerged in an endless stream. In 1839, the British Ross, aboard his flagship, entered the Antarctic Circle and discovered the Ross Sea, King Edward VII Land, and Mount Erebus, opening the way for today's exploration and becoming the most prominent figure of the 19th century. Later, many others went to Antarctica. Recently, with the development of aviation, U.S. Rear Admiral Byrd became a great figure in Antarctic exploration. In 1925, he flew to the Antarctic, and in 1928, he made a second expedition, flying over mountains 3,600 meters high and passing through plateaus 3,000 meters high. He discovered that there were many mountain ranges in Antarctica, confirming that Antarctica is indeed a continent. Since then, Antarctica has begun to attract people's attention.

Antarctica is a vast ice and snow plateau, covering more than 14 million square kilometers. The periphery of Antarctica is surrounded by the Southern Ocean. The Southern Ocean is connected to the Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian Oceans without boundaries. Its distribution of land and water is the opposite of the Arctic. The Arctic is centered on water, with the Arctic Ocean surrounded by the three continents of Europe, Asia, and America, while Antarctica is centered on land. The day and night in the Antarctic are also the opposite of the Arctic. From April to August, the sun is below the horizon, with night but no day. From August to April, the sun is above the horizon, with day but no night. When it is summer in the Antarctic, it is winter in the Arctic. The average temperature is below zero degrees, and rainfall is very scarce, averaging 300 mm.

Both the North and South Poles have a strange glow called the aurora, which is caused by the phenomenon of electrical bands radiating from the sun in the sky. The Antarctic aurora is shaped like a circular arc, with yellow-purple colors, extremely brilliant and beautiful. Its luminosity is not as strong as the Arctic aurora, and its frequency is also less.

The vegetation in the Antarctic is not as abundant as in the Arctic, because it is surrounded by large oceans, separated from other continents, and the climate is also cold. The only discoveries are mosses and algae. There are no residents in Antarctica, and there are few animals. However, there are whales, sea dogs, and sea elephants in the sea. Birds include petrels and seagulls. On land, there are many penguins. Besides these, there are no other plants or animals.

Antarctica was discovered by explorers from countries such as Britain and the United States. The issue of sovereignty over the territory has not yet been resolved. Therefore, countries do not easily give up. Because Antarctica has many good harbors that can become fishing ports or naval ports, and there are also many treasures waiting to be developed.
