### The Government Is Currently Seeking a "Key" to Reopen the Door to Peace Talks; The National Government's Executive Yuan Decides to Reorganize First

[Report from Our Newspaper] When Wu Tiecheng met with reporters on the 4th, he said: The government is determined to reorganize the Executive and National Government, but the National Assembly has just concluded and it is also the New Year holiday, so time is short. Therefore, consultations with various parties participating in the National Assembly on the reorganization of the government are still in the initial exploratory stage. The government has not yet had formal contact with the Nanjing delegation of the Chinese Communist Party, but the government would sincerely welcome the CCP and the Democratic League if they could participate in the government. The government has always hoped to reopen peace talks in order to achieve peaceful unification, and hopes that parties that did not participate in the National Assembly can also participate in the government.

The government has decided to reorganize the National Government Committee and the Executive Yuan first, according to the established steps. Whether the Legislative Yuan will be expanded is still under consideration by the government. Regarding the reports that opposition parties advocate expanding the Legislative Yuan to formulate various regulations related to the constitution, Wu said: The Legislative Yuan is part of the government, so participating in the Legislative Yuan also means participating in the government. As for the reorganization of the National Government Committee, some people believe that if the CCP and the Democratic League fail to participate and the seats on the committee remain vacant, the number of members from other parties participating in the reorganized government will be very small, and they will not be able to compete with the overwhelming majority of KMT members on the committee. Wu said: The government did not decide everything by an overwhelming majority when the Youth Party and the Social Democratic Party participated in the National Assembly. Based on past cooperative experience, he firmly believes that cooperation will not be impossible in the National Government Committee. After the National Government Committee is established in the future, the Supreme National Defense Council will be abolished, and how to reorganize the Executive Yuan will be decided in the National Government Committee meeting. There will be no changes in local governments for the time being, because local governments can be reorganized at any time as long as the central government deems it necessary.

Wu said: The work of the government cannot be suspended for a single day. Peace talks and the reorganization of the government should proceed simultaneously. We are now seeking a "key" to reopen the door to peace talks.

[Report from the Central News Agency in This City] Zeng Qi, Chairman of the Youth Party, and Standing Committee members Chen Qitian, Yu Jiaju, and Chang Naide, have arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing separately. It is reported that the party's standing committee regular meeting will be held in Shanghai within days to discuss the issue of participating in the government reorganization. When the reporter asked Chen Qitian yesterday whether he had met with Secretary-General Wu recently, he said: Party members in Nanjing had contacted Wu, but they have not met since returning to Shanghai, but they will definitely have the opportunity to meet again within days. Zhou Qianchong also said that recently, members of the party met with Zhang Junmai and Zhang Dongsun of the Social Democratic Party to exchange views, mentioning that Ambassador Stuart Leighton hoped that China could quickly restore a peaceful environment to facilitate the implementation of the constitution. Therefore, the party is now working hard to promote the resumption of peace talks between the KMT and the CCP. Zhou also said: We hope that if peace talks can be resumed, they must achieve true and lasting peace, and not create the dragged-out situation of the past, so as to actually benefit the overall situation.

[Report from Our Newspaper in Nanjing on the 4th] The new chairman, Zhang Zhizhong, has become the center of political activities in the current capital. Zhang has been meeting with various parties all day, and it is rumored that he is currently studying ways to resume peace talks. Zhang, accompanied by Pi Zonggan, a staff officer of the National Government, visited Special Envoy Marshall on the afternoon of the 4th and had talks. Zhang also visited Ambassador Marshall on the 3rd. It is rumored that Zhang's arrival in Nanjing is related to peace talks, which is not without reason.

[Report from the Central News Agency in Nanjing on the 4th] General Zhang Zhizhong, Chairman of Xinjiang Province, arrived in Nanjing the day before yesterday. Reporters specially went to meet him on the 4th. Zhang first explained that his return to Nanjing was purely to report on his work. He continued: Although he had only been in office as chairman of Xinjiang for nine months, he had been away from Nanjing for more than ten years, and it was difficult to avoid a sense of estrangement from the recent political developments. Zhang also told reporters in a humorous tone that the reports that he planned to play the role of a matchmaker again and mediate peace were new tasks assigned to him by the press. Zhang also said that the future administrative policy of Xinjiang Province would be carried out entirely in accordance with the drafted administrative program. At the same time, he would pay attention to the national spirit of the Three Principles of the People, protect the educational, economic, and political interests of ethnic minorities, and the current priority was to assist in improving the lives of local people and stabilizing prices. Since Chairman Zhang arrived in Nanjing, he has been very busy with socializing. He visited the Chairman on the 3rd and attended a luncheon at the invitation of Special Envoy Marshall today.

### The American Christian Science Monitor Analyzes the Relationship between the KMT and the CCP in Detail

It is said that although the CCP claims to boycott the new constitution, the door to participating in the government has not been closed, because there is still a cautious hope for resuming negotiations to end the internal strife. The newspaper also has another article discussing China's long and painful journey toward a constitutional government.

### President Yu's Broadcast

Encouraging Citizens to Fulfill Their Responsibilities

[Report from the Central News Agency in Nanjing on the 4th] President Yu was invited by the Central Broadcasting Station on the 3rd to speak on "The New China After the Promulgation of the Constitution." Yu believed that the formulation of the constitution was the cornerstone for the success of national construction. Yu pointed out that after the implementation of the constitution, the Kuomintang would formally transfer political power to the people to fulfill their long-held aspirations. In the future, the rise and fall of the country will depend entirely on the people's ability to fulfill their responsibilities as masters of the country. From the date of the promulgation of the constitution to the date of its implementation, during this period, the National Government will naturally implement the preparations according to the procedures of the constitution, but how to carefully select the worthy and capable to represent the people in supervising the government depends entirely on all the people. If we want to succeed in building a truly democratic country, every citizen must fulfill their responsibilities, especially the responsibility of upholding and implementing the constitution.

### The Executive Yuan Issues Circular to All Agencies and Schools: Do Not Insult Our Friendly Nations; American Soldiers Who Commit Crimes Should Be Sanctioned

[Report from the Central News Agency in Nanjing on the 4th] Regarding the incident of American soldiers raping female students in Beiping, the Executive Yuan's instructions to the Ministry of Education and local governments are as follows: "It is reported that two American soldiers in Beiping committed the act of raping Chinese female students. It is now learned that the American side has handed over the offending American soldiers to military trial in accordance with the law, and our Beiping Municipal Government is also negotiating on the spot. This matter is the personal behavior of the offending American soldiers, and the offenders should be sanctioned by law. As for the friendship between China and the United States, it should not be damaged as a result of this. No one should use this kind of personal behavior as an excuse to damage our friendly nations or the people of friendly nations. All school authorities and local administrative agencies should earnestly follow this principle and be responsible for dissuading. If there are any actions that may be out of line, they should also be responsible for stopping them."

### The Ambassador Lacks an Opinion

This Matter Is Not Related to the Overall Issue

[Report from Our Newspaper in Nanjing on the 4th] Howard, Commander of the U.S. Military in the Beiping-Tianjin Area, arrived in Nanjing on the 3rd to report the incident involving the U.S. military in Beiping to Ambassadors Marshall and Leighton. He also visited Bai Chongxi in the morning and had talks before returning to Beiping. When our reporter visited Ambassador Stuart Leighton recently and asked for his opinion on this matter, the ambassador said: This is a matter of American military law and is not related to the overall issue.

[Report from Our Newspaper in Nanjing on the 4th] Students in Nanjing launched demonstrations for the past two days regarding the rape of female students by American soldiers in Beiping. The schools have returned to calm on the 4th. Minister of Education Zhu Jiahua visited Ambassador Stuart Leighton at 11:30 am and discussed the matter. When reporters visited Zhu in the evening and asked for his opinion on the incident, he said: This matter is a legal issue and should be handled according to law. The students' march and petition were not mentioned to him and are now in the past.

### Fu Sinian's Remarks

[Report from the United News Agency in Nanjing on the 4th] Fu Sinian, director of the Department of History at the Academia Sinica, told the United News Agency reporter today regarding the student demonstrations that the students in various schools mistakenly treated an event unrelated to politics as a political event. This case is certainly extremely regrettable, but it is purely a legal matter. When the reporter asked him about the students' request for the withdrawal of American troops from China, Fu replied: Allowing American troops to stay in China is entirely a matter of the Chinese government's policy. If students are dissatisfied with this policy, they can petition the government. Sixteen months ago, American troops fought side by side with the Chinese army against a common enemy. In the past ten months, American troops have also assisted the Chinese government in repatriating Japanese prisoners. This task has not yet ended, and there are still a large number of Japanese soldiers in China who have not been disarmed. Chinese intellectuals should have a long-term vision of international politics and must recognize that China cannot be isolated internationally.

[Report from the United Press Agency in Nanjing on the 4th] Thousands of students from various universities in Nanjing held demonstrations on the 3rd, demanding the withdrawal of American troops from China. Afterwards, the organizers hosted reporters from various newspapers. When the reporters raised various questions, the three student representatives who spoke were unable to answer fluently. One reporter insisted on explaining the true meaning of their demonstrations. The student representatives conferred and whispered to each other for a long time. Finally, one of them stammered, "You reporters cannot interrogate us with this complicated question. We are just students, and what we know is limited." The reporter then raised a question saying: They demanded the withdrawal of American troops from China, is Special Envoy Marshall also included in this case? Why did they not mention a word about the Soviet troops still stationed in various parts of the Northeast in the demands they put forward? The student representatives hesitated and replied, "We have not yet considered that question. This question needs to be decided by all the students?" Afterwards, the reporters raised a number of questions, but could not get to the point, and left in disappointment.

It is rumored that the opium is purchased from Korea, with each ounce costing about 800 yuan in circulating notes and 4,000 yuan in the Andong black market.

### Li Sichong Discusses the Powers of the Control Yuan: Great Changes After the Promulgation of the Constitution Compared to the Past

[Report from Our Newspaper in Beiping on the 4th] Li Sichong, the Hebei Inspector, returned to Beiping the day before yesterday and met with reporters today, saying: Outside rumors about the Control Yuan being reorganized are inaccurate. He had not heard of this matter when he met with President Yu in Nanjing. However, after the promulgation of the Constitution, the powers of the Control Yuan have greatly changed compared to the past. Before leaving Nanjing, the Control Yuan had held several meetings to discuss changing various laws and regulations to adapt to this new situation. According to reports, the changes in the Constitutional Control Yuan are as follows: (1) A new power of consent has been added. The appointment of the Grand Justices of the Judicial Yuan and the members of the Examination Yuan of the Examination Yuan must be approved by the Control Yuan. (2) In the past, the Control Yuan had a temporary power of impeachment. Now this power is formal. Those who are impeached must be dealt with or replied by their competent authorities within one month, which is faster than impeachment in the past. (3) The past suggestions have been changed to the power of correction.

### The Council of Advisors Resident Committee Continued to Meet Yesterday; The General Budget Was Largely Reviewed; Three People Were Assigned to Investigate the Shanghai Plane Crash

[Report from Our Newspaper in Nanjing on the 4th] The Resident Committee of the Council of Advisors held its third temporary meeting at 9 am on the 4th. Only Si Nian, Zuo Shunsheng, and others attended. Wu Yifang presided over the meeting. First, Lin Wei, Vice Minister of National Defense, reported the main points of the National Defense Budget. According to the administrative policy, the number of soldiers should be reduced, and the demobilization and demobilization work should be completed. The total amount is more than 3 trillion, accounting for 40% of the total budget. Then, Zhao Zhuanyao, Director of the Budget Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense, supplemented the explanation. Councilors Meng Ge Chen, Yin Shuxian, Zhang Boling, and others spoke one after another, raising questions. Their opinions were roughly as follows: (1) Reduce military spending. The current budget and the number of people do not match. (2) There are too many officers and soldiers, and the cost of food and fodder is not enough. (3) The budget compilation is not a matter of percentage and the size of the amount, but whether the content is reasonable or not. (4) Non-combat personnel should be reduced. (5) Improve the treatment of soldiers. (6) Abolish the conscription of military grain? (7) Demobilized officers and soldiers should be guaranteed. (8) The military budget does not need to be reduced, but it is hoped that it will not exceed the budget. (9) There are many abuses in conscription, and the treatment of civil and military officials is very different. The above questions were answered separately by Lin and Zhao. Then it was decided to divide into three groups for review. The first group reviewed national defense and military affairs, the second group reviewed finance and finance, and the third group reviewed other matters. Regarding the Shanghai plane crash, the previous meeting decided to organize an investigation committee. Today, Jiang Yong, Yin Shuxian, and Zheng Kuiyi were appointed as investigation committee members to be responsible for investigating the cause of the accident. The meeting adjourned at 1 pm.

### Minister Peng Discusses This Year's Characteristics: In Politics, It Will Be the Beginning of Constitutionalism; In Economics, It Will Be Diligent Work

[Central News Agency, this city report] Peng Xuepei, Minister of the Central Propaganda Department, in order to celebrate the New Year and the promulgation of the Constitution of the Republic of China, held a cocktail party at the Hua Mao Hotel on the 8th floor yesterday afternoon to entertain famous Chinese and foreign figures in this city, major figures from the Minshe Party, the Youth Party, and people from the Chinese and foreign press. Xu Jiguang, Wang Xiaolai, Chang Naixian of the Youth Party, Chen Qitian, Zhou Shuichong, Cui Wanqiu, and British Naval Liaison Officer Colonel Zoss were present, as well as News Office Director Lieutenant Oder, US News Office Director Cowell, French News Office Director Gan Mo, and more than a hundred people in charge of Chinese and foreign newspapers, news agencies, and magazines in this city. Minister Peng was the target of interviews by journalists at the meeting. Mr. Peng mingled among them and answered some questions from reporters. The grand event ended at 5:30. Minister Peng issued a written statement at yesterday's reception, the original text of which is as follows: "A country with a population of 400 million, including many ethnic groups such as Han, Manchu, Mongolian, Hui, and Tibetan, unanimously agreed to enact a constitution in 40 days. This has to be said to be an astonishing fact. Even the Chinese Communists, who oppose everything, signed and approved the basic principles of this constitution during the Political Consultative Conference. The smooth passage of this constitution may seem easy, but it is actually the result of the six decades of revolution and resistance led by the founding father Sun Yat-sen and President Chiang Kai-shek. Now that we have this constitution, we can only achieve peace, unity, and democracy by adhering to it together and resolving all disputes in accordance with it.

China's economic life has not seen significant improvement one and a half years after the victory. The reason is very simple. The destruction in various places during the eight years of the War of Resistance and after the war was severe, which is beyond the imagination of ordinary people. Let me give a few examples to illustrate.

In terms of transportation, there were 112,000 kilometers of highways within the passes before the war, and 14,000 kilometers were newly built in the rear during the War of Resistance. Now, at least 50,000 kilometers of these highways need to be repaired. Before the war, it cost about 10,000 yuan to repair one kilometer of highway. Now, it costs 100 million yuan per kilometer, a price increase of 10,000 times. The repair cost is also at least 20 million yuan per kilometer on average before the road can be used. That is to say, just repairing the existing highways will require one trillion yuan.

The railways were damaged during the war, and 2,700 kilometers have not been repaired yet, all of which are south of the Yangtze River. Another 1,900 kilometers were destroyed by the Chinese Communists after the war and have not been repaired, all of which are north of the Longhai Railway. In total, about 4,600 kilometers of old roads need to be repaired. Before the war, the average construction cost per kilometer of railway was 100,000 yuan. Now, it is an average of 1 billion yuan per kilometer. The degree of damage to each road is very severe, and repairs are almost equivalent to reconstruction. Just repairing the old railways will cost about 4.8 trillion yuan.

The only important industry left over from the War of Resistance is the textile industry. Two years before the war, domestic cotton production had reached self-sufficiency. Now, the number of spindles has decreased, and three-quarters of the cotton relies on foreign imports, consuming huge amounts of foreign exchange.

Before the war, the annual coal production within the passes was 20 million tons. Now, it has fallen to 8 million tons. The loss of power and transportation equipment in the coal mines within the passes is about 80 percent. Recently, the Datong Coal Mine, which was in very good condition, was completely destroyed again.

Of course, we took over some factories from the enemy and puppets. These machines were quite useful during the wartime blockade. Now that the country is open, given the competition from new foreign machines, most of those machines can probably only be regarded as scrap iron.

The seriousness of housing shortages is no less than other items. Taking Jiangxi as an example, three-quarters of the houses in the provincial capital Nanchang were destroyed. Among the 83 counties in the province, more than 30 counties lost one-fifth of their residential buildings. As a result, refugees who have been displaced cannot return to their hometowns. Full recovery may take a century. If one province is like this, others can be imagined.

Before the war, three major rivers in central China flowed into the ocean: the Yellow River, the Huai River, and the Yangtze River. As a result of various destructions during the War of Resistance, the Yellow River and the Huai River both carry huge amounts of sediment into the Yangtze River, causing a gradual silting hazard. Now, the first thing to do is to move the two rivers back to their original courses separately. The funds required are difficult to estimate.

After these damages and losses, recovery requires first cash, second materials, third manpower, and fourth time. None of these four can be done overnight. Under the current situation, ruins are everywhere across the country, factories and mines are destroyed, transportation is blocked, fuel is scarce, and raw materials are lacking. The national economic problem is a material problem, a difficult problem, and it cannot be solved simply by adjusting exchange rates, tariffs, tax systems, or other theoretical policies on paper. The only way out is to work hard in construction with blood and sweat under extreme austerity.

The characteristics of this year will be the beginning of constitutionalism in politics and a life of hard work and diligent work in economics."

Minister of Propaganda Peng Xuepei tells all sectors in Shanghai that the one being interviewed is Mr. Peng (China News Agency)

### The Siege of Jinxiang, Western Shandong, Is Lifted; The Communist Army's Attack on Xuzhou Fails; The Plan to Emulate the Japanese Army's Death-Defying Encirclement Is Shattered; The National Army in Jixiang Withdraws Automatically to Avoid Damage

[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 4th dispatch] The Communist army emulated the old trick of the Japanese army in the Battle of Xuzhou, attempting to launch a circular offensive against the National Army in Xuzhou from the east and west. Now, it has obviously failed. The Yang Yong Column under Liu Bocheng's command on the western route captured Juye on the 2nd and occupied Jiaxiang. After the Jinxiang National Army, they intended to go straight to Dangshan, following the example of Doihara, to cut off the Longhai Railway. Unexpectedly, the National Army of Caozhou launched a joint counterattack, and by the 4th, the siege of Jinxiang was lifted. The remnants of Yang Yong's army have also begun to flee north. The Chen Yi's troops on the eastern route launched a fierce attack on the National Army's positions near Xiangcheng southwest of Linyi before dawn on the 3rd, also intending to imitate the attacks on Zaocheng and Iitani, directly taking Taierzhuang and threatening the northeast of Xuzhou. The National Army in that area took rapid action and fought a bloody battle with the invading Communist army for a day and night, and by the 4th, their attempt was also shattered.

[Central News Agency, Jinan, 4th dispatch] Kuoxian County in western Shandong was once recovered by the National Army and local militias last month. However, due to the Communist army's Liu Bocheng's troops transferring a large number of troops from Fanxian Guancheng and other places to attack, the National Army transferred to outposts outside the city to avoid sacrifices. Now, the National Army re-entered the city on the afternoon of the 2nd. Except for a small number of Communist troops fleeing, the rest were captured. In addition, Guancheng County was also recovered by the National Army on the afternoon of the 2nd. The Communist Army's Yellow River Detachment and the Sixth Regiment of the Fourth Column fled to Chaocheng.

[This newspaper, Nanjing, 4th dispatch] It is learned that: (1) The National Army stationed in Jiaxiang on the right wing of Juye withdrew from the city automatically on the 2nd to avoid being attacked by the Communist army and causing damage. (2) The Communist army increased its troops and fiercely attacked Jinxiang. The defending National Army stubbornly resisted, and the battle was extremely tragic. The National Army's support team outside the line has advanced to Xiaobian, about ten kilometers southeast of Jinxiang, and the crisis in the city has been lifted. (3) The Communist army's Fourth and Ninth Divisions, the New Seventh and Tenth Divisions, and the First and Eighth Divisions, totaling more than 30,000 people, suddenly attacked the National Army's positions in Jia Village, Ka Village, and other places on the outskirts of Yixian at 10:00 p.m. on the 3rd. The battle was extremely fierce. In order to reduce losses, the National Army withdrew the guard posts stationed in Shangyan, Qingshan, Shicheng, Chuanshankou, and other places, and is now fiercely fighting on the Xinxing, Yulou, and Xingming lines.

[This newspaper, Xuzhou, 4th dispatch] The Communist army's New Tenth and Eighth Divisions, with about three to four thousand people, are currently fleeing to Xiadian Baojiagou, east of Peixian, and there is a trend of crossing Weishan Lake and attacking westward.

### The Ordeal of the Breakthrough from Liaocheng; Mr. Wang Jinxiang's Account

[Central News Agency, Jinan, 4th dispatch] The soldiers and civilians who broke through from Liaocheng arrived in Qihe on the evening of the 3rd.

At noon, he attended a banquet hosted by the heads of the provincial government departments, and in the afternoon, he led personnel to carry comfort goods and food to Qihe to comfort all the soldiers and civilians. The provincial government rushed to provide emergency relief, distributing a bag of flour and a set of cotton clothes to each person, and set up three refugee shelters and a temporary middle school to provide accommodation and relief. Mr. Wang told reporters about the ordeal of the breakthrough, saying: The city was besieged on New Year's Eve of the 34th year and lasted for a year. On New Year's Eve last year, the National Army's reinforcements arrived in Liaocheng. At 12 o'clock that night, it was decided to break through. At 2:00 a.m. on New Year's Day, the troops led a breakthrough from Dongguan, including 2,000 officers and soldiers, more than 100 party and government personnel, and 800 civilians. They encountered the Communist Army's Seventh Column and Thirteenth Column twice on the way to Dinghui, northeast of Liaocheng. The Communist army suffered more than 2,000 casualties. On the evening of the 2nd, they stayed in Ershilibao, Hongmiao, and Baigang (near Renping). During the siege of the city, the Communist army launched many fierce attacks, and the soldiers and civilians of the whole city worked together to defend it, and fortunately, they were able to preserve the isolated city. At this moment, almost all the houses in the city have been destroyed by the Communist army's artillery fire, but there are still four priests and more than ten elderly, sick, and disabled people left in the city.

### The Communist Army in Hebei Holds a Meeting in Yixian, Planning to Launch a Spring Offensive; The Communist Army Gathers on the Banks of the Wuding River, Preparing to Attack Yulin

[This newspaper, Baoding, 4th dispatch] The National Army and the Communist Army near Baoding have been frequently mobilized recently, seemingly preparing for an offensive and defensive battle. The Communist army is gathering between Baoxi and Yujiazhuang Wangdu, and a major battle may break out again. The Communist army on the bank of the Jinhe River sneaks into the suburbs of Baoding late at night, and there are occasional small clashes. Senior generals of the Communist army in Hebei recently held a meeting in Yixian, planning to launch a spring offensive in Hebei, Chahar, and Shanxi. It is said that Mao Zedong has arrived in western Hebei, and it is also rumored that Liu Bocheng went to Lu'an to instigate Gao Shuxun to participate in the war.

[This newspaper, Beiping, 4th dispatch] According to Sun Changguan Suzong, there are 120,000 Communist troops in the northern section of the Pinghan Railway, but there has been no major action recently. Communist militia have been constantly surrendering recently, and more than 10,000 people have returned in Hebei alone, which is very noteworthy. The headquarters of the Eleventh War Zone moved to Baoding to handle most of the affairs.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 4th dispatch] In response to the Xinhua News Agency's propaganda that the National Army's Hu Zongnan's troops are currently attacking Guanzhong in three routes, this reporter specially visited the military spokesperson of the Ministry of National Defense. According to the answer: The Communist army is currently drawing six infantry regiments and more than 40,000 militiamen from Yan'an and gathering in the area west of the Wuding River, preparing to launch a large-scale attack on Yulin. The statement that the National Army is attacking Guanzhong is completely untrue and is thought to be a fabrication to cover up military actions.

[This newspaper, Beiping, 4th dispatch] The situation in the north has been uncertain in recent weeks, and the war news is constant, but the Pinghan Road is still being damaged. A section between Liulihe and Yongle was damaged by the Communist army both yesterday and the day before yesterday, and was immediately repaired. Passenger transport between Ping and Bao is still not open.

[This newspaper, Beiping, 4th dispatch] Since the night before New Year's Day, Jicheng in southern Shanxi has been fiercely attacked by the Communist army from the east, west, and south, and the city is now heavily surrounded. Beiqu Village, north of Quwo County, has also been under attack by the Communist army since New Year's Day. In addition, four brigades of the Communist army have gathered on the periphery of Guangling in southern Shanxi, preparing to attack the city.

[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 4th dispatch] Three brigades of the Communist army and Wang Tang's troops, as well as militia brigades from various counties, totaling more than 10,000, are gradually advancing towards the north and northeast of Quwo. They are now only ten kilometers away from the city walls. More than 2,000 Communist troops who fled west from the southern foot of Ershan Mountain in the northern district of Jicheng, one part arrived at Dicun De (six kilometers northeast of Quwo), and another part arrived at Guhui Jiao (northeast of Quwo), with the potential to attack Quwo and Houma in separate ways. More than 600 Communist troops who fled from Wenxi on the 29th of last month are currently engaged in fierce fighting with our police force near Tanjiagou. The Communist army in Wuxiang recently set up an arsenal in Bangou Village, five kilometers southeast of the city, destroying the rails of the Dongqin Line and allowing them to be used as materials.

### Anti-Chinese Actions by Bandits Intensify; It Is Announced That Overseas Chinese Will Not Be Allowed to Enter the Country Temporarily; We Will Adopt Further Measures Against the Bandits

[United Press, Manila, 4th dispatch] The Philippine government announced today that it will temporarily suspend allowing overseas Chinese to enter the country until a general treaty is concluded between China and the Philippines. The Philippine government did not explain this move, but it is heard that Philippine President Roxas strongly opposed a certain clause in the draft treaty carried by the Chinese envoy to the Philippines, which is related to this matter. However, the nature of this clause is unknown. Roxas will reorganize the expulsion committee, intensify the implementation of immigration laws, order each case to be thoroughly investigated within fifteen days, and has ordered immigration commissioner Faber to report in detail on the illegal entry of overseas Chinese along the northwest coast of Luzon and the Sulu Archipelago.

[United Press, Manila, 3rd dispatch] Philippine Immigration Commissioner Faber announced new rules today, prohibiting all overseas Chinese immigration agencies from directly or indirectly handling immigration matters with the bureau. From now on, those who wish to enter the Philippines do not need to go through such intermediary agencies and can directly apply to the immigration bureau. However, from January to October this year, only 50 foreigners will be allowed to immigrate and reside each month.

[This newspaper, Nanjing, 4th dispatch] Since the first President of the independent Philippines, Roxas, took office, the anti-Chinese movement of bandits has sprung up. After the implementation of the Filipino Market Law in Manila, the Filipino Retail Law and the Filipino Labor Law were successively passed. The Filipino Retail Law was implemented on New Year's Day this year. The official protest submitted by our envoy to the Philippines, Chen Zhiping, on December 19 last year regarding this law has been completely ignored and has not received any response. It is heard that our relevant authorities, if this continues, our many overseas Chinese in the Philippines will inevitably find it difficult to make a living, and there will be no place to stand. In order to ensure the rights and interests of overseas Chinese and safeguard national dignity, they are considering necessary further measures.

### The Blocking and Repair Project of Huayuankou Has Been Delayed to This Day Due to the Obstruction of the Communist Army; If There Are No Accidents, It Can Be Closed Before the Spring Flood

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 4th dispatch] After the Yellow River burst at Huayuankou, Zheng County, in the 27th year, the floodwaters flowed south and entered the Grand Canal, flooding an area of 29,000 square kilometers and affecting more than 6 million people, resulting in an unprecedented disaster. Before and after the victory, local governments in Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu, as well as provincial and county public opinion organs, have petitioned for the completion of the breach sealing work as soon as possible. The central government, in order to address the suffering of the people and seek to restore production in the vast flooded area, decided to proceed with the policy of sealing the breach and restoring the embankment. The work officially started on March 1 last year, but because the Yellow River embankment is as long as more than 1,400 kilometers, two-thirds of which is under the control of the Communist army, not only is construction impossible, but even preliminary reconnaissance and surveying cannot be carried out. In order to save the more than 6 million victims in the flooded area, the government repeatedly discussed the methods of sealing the breach and restoring the embankment with the Communist army. Since the principle of implementation was agreed upon with the Communist army representatives in Beijing on May 18, the Water Conservancy Committee has proceeded in accordance with the agreement. During this period, the Communist army repeatedly obstructed and violated the agreement. The destruction of the Wangfen Stone Factory in Xinxiang, the capture of employees of the Shandong Repair and Defense Office surveying team in Jiyang, and the recent abduction of employees at the Changyuan construction site in Hebei, and the destruction of the Wangfen Stone Factory again, are all clear evidence, but the Water Conservancy Committee has always proceeded carefully in accordance with the principles of the agreement. Now, the construction of the breach-sealing piles has been completed, and the embankment protection work is being rushed, and the progress is still smooth. If there are no unexpected obstructions, it can be closed before the spring flood.

According to the principles of the agreement, the embankment restoration project downstream in the Communist-controlled area should be handled by the Communist army. The funds for this project have been reviewed by the Water Conservancy Committee based on the suggestions of American consultant Todd, and 8 billion yuan has been approved and allocated to UNRRA in the sixth and seventh months to be paid according to the value of the work completed. According to the consultant's inspection report, it is believed that the payments already made and the food issued by UNRRA can offset the costs of the unfinished project. As for the restoration of the embankment in the National Army's territory, the earthwork that has been completed now totals more than 3 million cubic meters, and it will also reach the completion stage. In addition, regarding the embankment restoration project in the area bordering the National Army and the Communist Army, because the staff cannot go there, the Yellow River Blocking and Embankment Restoration Project Bureau sent personnel to accompany consultant Todd and Communist Army representatives to inspect the project in order to speed up the progress. According to the report on December 25, after the members entered the Communist Army area, they were intercepted by the Communist Army five times in three days, and more than a hundred shots were fired, making it impossible to carry out the inspection mission. They stopped advancing after reaching Zhangqiuji, Shandong Province, similar planned obstructions have a serious impact on the entire Yellow River blocking and embankment restoration.

Regarding the relocation and relief expenses for the residents of the old riverbed of the common river under the jurisdiction of the Communist Army, because the old riverbed originally belonged to the riverbed, the people should not live there. In order to take care of people's livelihoods and ensure the smooth progress of the project, the government has approved and allocated special funds to UNRRA to host the matter in accordance with the agreed-upon methods, in order to benefit the people, and it is now actively proceeding.

### Sir Cripps Sends a Letter to Thank the President and His Wife

### Japanese Cheap Textiles Will Seize the World Market - New York Business Week Issues Warning

[Central News Agency, New York, 4th] According to Business Week magazine: with the assistance of the American military authorities, Japan's cheap textiles will quickly gain a dominant position in world markets, while China's poor economic situation makes it impossible for its domestic factories to obtain the textile trade once controlled by Japan as they hope. Business Week also stated: The American military authorities stationed in Japan are strongly advocating a rapid increase in the production of Japanese textiles to pay for the Allied occupation costs. At the same time, members of the textile industry in the British trade delegation, currently visiting various Eastern countries, have warned that Britain will block any plan to allow Japan to restore its textile market in Southeast Asia. The weekly also predicts that the prolonged instability of French-controlled Vietnam will prevent the large-scale production of rice and coal from Vietnam, which are urgently needed by various Eastern countries.

### The New Great Wall Beyond the Frontier (Part 1) - A Record of an Interview with General Fu Zuoyi

— Our Reporter Yu Zhenji

Aspiring to Serve the People's Will

At a rare gathering in Zhangjiakou, a foreign reporter, flushed with excitement after drinking, raised his glass to General Fu Zuoyi and offered a toast, saying, "Marshal Marshall praised you, saying that every inch of you exudes the air of a good general. It is truly an honor to witness your demeanor today." These well-chosen words of praise and blessing would presumably have earned General Fu's nod of approval. Unexpectedly, the words revealed by General Fu expressed a sense of uneasiness, and he stated: "I myself cannot see anything special about myself. I only feel that I am a rustic old country fellow, a commoner from the people. If I, Fu Zuoyi, have achieved anything, it is entirely because everything I have done has been in accordance with the will of the people. I will do whatever the people want to do, and I will never do anything that goes against the will of the people. For example, the War of Resistance Against Japan was what every citizen wanted at the time. I resisted Japan according to the wishes of the people and defeated the Japanese. Other generals who fought against Japan also defeated the Japanese invaders. Everything I am doing now is also entirely in accordance with the will of the people." These words from the bottom of his heart were fully confirmed during the reporter's short stay in Zhangjiakou.

The Need for Stability and Food

What the people need most at the moment is stability and food. What General Fu Zuoyi is currently doing in Chahar Province is to achieve these two goals. He said: "In the future, the administrative policy of Chahar Province will mainly be to stabilize public security and improve the people's lives. Chahar Province is not poor. Saying it is poor is no different from saying it is rich. If it is properly developed, it has unlimited prospects."

What makes him most sad is that Chahar Province has been damaged too severely. Because talking about this point leads to the future of the entire country, he is very concerned about national affairs. He repeatedly asked the reporters for their thoughts on this National Assembly. He believes that the constitution drafted by this National Assembly is the result of decades of struggle and resistance against Japan by the people of the country. The new democratic elements are very numerous. Even if the Communist Party does not endorse it, it will not have much impact, because it is impossible for the constitution to be approved by everyone. The current constitution is based on the will of the majority of the people, so it should not be affected by the opposition of a few people.

Hoping for Cooperation from the CCP

Although he holds this view of the constitution, General Fu has always hoped that the CCP can work hand in hand with the government. The group of Chinese and foreign reporters visited Zhangjiakou four times, and in each conversation, he emphasized this point. On the evening when the reporter group returned to Zhangjiakou after visiting the bloody facts in Chongli, he expressed his feelings about the tragedy in an extremely sorrowful tone, but still said: "The government hopes for peace. For the sake of the people, I also desperately hope for peace. As long as the negotiations go well, no problem is difficult to solve."

One reporter asked him to guess where the CCP would finally relocate to, as newspapers in Nanjing speculated that the CCP might launch another Long March, relocating its base from Yan'an to Jiamusi in the Northeast, Shanxi, or Ningxia. General Fu's reply was: "I hope they don't run away, but come and cooperate with us for the sake of the country's future. We hope to embark on the path of democratic unification." These frank and sincere words moved all the reporters present at the time. I believe that the other party will not be indifferent after hearing these words. (To be continued)

Editorial

### A New Dawn for Burmese Independence

A relatively gratifying piece of news from London on New Year's Day 1947 was that U Aung San, Vice-Chairman of the Burmese Government's Executive Council, had been sent to London to attend a meeting convened by Prime Minister Attlee regarding the future of Burma. According to news from Yangon, the Burmese interim government has decided to send a delegation to London to attend talks on the future of Burma and Anglo-Burmese relations, with U Aung San, Vice-Chairman of the Executive Council, as the head of the delegation, which will leave Burma for England on January 1st. On the eve of his departure, U Aung San delivered a speech to 40,000 people attending the mass meeting in Yangon, urging the Burmese people to make a final struggle to prepare to achieve their goals, and specifically pointed out, "Revolution is not the true will of Burma." U Aung San also said: "At this moment, it is impossible to predict the success of the Anglo-Burmese talks in London; perhaps we can get what we want, but if we cannot get what we want, then we must be prepared for decisive action." Now that U Aung San is on his way to England, regardless of the outcome of the Anglo-Burmese talks, the very fact that this meeting can be convened is gratifying; especially as we see this good news coming in the New Year.

Why is this news good news? It indicates that a ruling nation and a ruled nation are willing to resolve all issues regarding the adjustment of their future relations through negotiation. It indicates that a ruling nation is willing to change its position in a peaceful manner in order to satisfy the aspirations of the ruled nation, and at the same time, it also indicates that a ruled nation is willing to fulfill their aspirations in a peaceful manner. The convening of these Anglo-Burmese talks is itself a manifestation of the spirit of cooperation and is worthy of our praise. We cannot help but praise Prime Minister Attlee's enlightened policy and the legitimate path taken by the Burmese leaders in achieving their national aspirations. At a time when the situation in the Far East is still turbulent and the national movements of various ruled nations are gathering momentum, the imminent convening of the Anglo-Burmese talks has a demonstrative effect on determining the future of various ruled nations in the Far East. We believe that since both the British and Burmese sides have the desire to resolve the Burmese situation peacefully, the Anglo-Burmese talks to be held in London will definitely be successful.

The convening of these Anglo-Burmese talks was initially announced by Prime Minister Attlee in Parliament on December 20th and scheduled to be held in London from January 3rd. The announcement of the convening of this meeting came just after the Indian representatives had gathered in London to discuss the constitution, which immediately aroused sharp criticism from the Conservative Party and its leader Churchill, who believed that the establishment of the British Empire was the result of centuries of hard work by the British people, and should not be accelerated the destruction of it by the Labor government. However, Churchill's roaring lion could not shake the Labor government's decision; judging from the facts, the British government had no other way to go except to help India and Burma gain independence and autonomy. Churchill was engaged in the war to establish the British Empire in South Africa and witnessed the decline of the empire, so he could not help but have many feelings. However, for the sake of Britain's own interests, it is not necessarily beneficial to its own country to rule over a nation that is unwilling to be ruled, and on the contrary, it will inevitably be a burden. Therefore, the Attlee government's adoption of an enlightened policy at this moment, allowing the people of India and Burma to fulfill their aspirations, is indeed a wise decision, which is also beneficial to Britain itself. The British Empire has gone through many historical stages; from a prisoner colony to the highly autonomous "dominion" of today, which is virtually independent. There have been many changes in the meantime. If the British Empire has strength, this strength is not produced by the severity of the rule, but by the abandonment of the rule. This can be seen from how Canada, Australia, and other places are loyal to the empire, and how Britain itself has gained their new support by abandoning its rule over them.

Since Burma fell under British rule, due to the ignorance of the British-Indian authorities at the time, the rule of Burma was assigned to the Indian government in New Delhi, which caused Burma to become a colony of a colony, and all aspects of Burmese society and economy were covered with a very strong Indian color. This is a very unnatural development in Burma. Although India and Burma are geographically connected, the people of India and the people of Burma have differences not only in race and language but also in history and culture. As early as before the outbreak of the Pacific War, the British government decided to separate India and Burma and prepared to grant Burma the status of a "dominion." Unfortunately, the war broke out suddenly, and the Burmese situation has not been resolved to this day. Now that the British government has convened Anglo-Burmese talks, and U Aung San said on the occasion of leaving Burma for England that "revolution is not the true will of Burma," then the convening of these Anglo-Burmese talks may be able to satisfy the aspirations of the Burmese people.

Here, what we cannot help but think of is the situation in Vietnam. Since armed struggles have broken out in the Hanoi and Tonkin areas, the French government has adopted a tough policy in handling the Vietnam issue. As recently as the 2nd of this month, according to a report from Paris by the Associated Press, a French government spokesperson refuted the peace proposals made by Ho Chi Minh, President of the Republic of Vietnam, saying that it was impossible to negotiate under the current circumstances. It can be seen that the French government still believes that a high-pressure policy can quell everything. This truly shows the face of the past imperialism; it is really regrettable. With the new development of the Burmese situation, we hope that the French authorities can also adopt a more enlightened policy in handling the Vietnamese situation so that the Vietnamese situation can tend to stability. This is not insignificant in relation to the maintenance of peace and stability in the Far East. The Blum government, which prides itself on progress, should no longer have the remnants of imperialism.

### Deadline for Third-Party Reporting of Traitors - The Jiangsu High Court Has Received Telegram Orders - Cases Accepted Before the Deadline Will Still Be Prosecuted According to Law - Cases Eligible for Amnesty Are Being Sorted Out

[Our newspaper Suzhou 4th] Various parties are paying close attention to the deadline for third-party reporting of traitors. It was previously rumored that the deadline would be December 31, 1946, but because the judicial authorities had not received orders, it was difficult to confirm. Recently, the Suzhou High Court received a telegram order from the Ministry of Justice at 6:25 pm on the 4th, which stated: After the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, large and small traitors have been arrested one after another. Among them, there are also many who have made false accusations due to revenge. In order to maintain judicial dignity and eliminate such arbitrary reports, it has been decided after a meeting that all cases of third-party reporting of traitors after December 31, 1946, will not be accepted. You are hereby ordered to instruct your subordinates to comply accordingly. This newspaper reporter specially visited Chief Prosecutor Han Xun of the Suzhou High Prosecutor's Office at night to inquire about this matter. He was informed: Traitor cases that have been accepted and are being handled by third parties before December 31, 1946, will still be prosecuted according to law. However, in the future, all cases where a non-victim brings evidence to court to sue should be rejected. As for the promulgation of the Amnesty Ordinance, this office has only seen it in the newspapers and has not yet received an order. However, this court is now sorting out cases that are eligible for amnesty, and it can be implemented as soon as the central government issues a clear order.

[Our newspaper Hangzhou 4th] Because of financial difficulties in Zhejiang Province, major construction plans cannot be carried out. Last year, construction work relied entirely on the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration's relief flour and national compulsory labor. Small-scale water conservancy projects and highway roadbed construction were able to proceed smoothly. This year, most of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) supplies transported to China are industrial machinery, and it is difficult to allocate the work-relief flour that Zhejiang Province originally approved. Panic has arisen everywhere, and construction is bound to be hindered. Therefore, the Construction Bureau should convene relevant personnel to discuss and determine the minimum amount, and Bureau Chief Pi and Zhejiang Branch Director Sun will go to Shanghai tomorrow to appeal in order to save the construction of Zhejiang Province.

### Jinhua Rice Prices Skyrocket, Like a Mad Rush for All Goods

[Our Newspaper Jinhua Dispatch] Rice prices in this county have recently begun to rise sharply. It is said that some unscrupulous merchants entrusted rice shops to purchase and transport rice in large quantities for export, resulting in supply falling short of demand, and prices rising again and again, soaring upwards. Not long ago, it had not broken the 30,000 yuan mark, but now it has jumped to 34,000 yuan per dan. Ordinary citizens and low-income people are all crying out in hardship.

[Our Newspaper Rugao Dispatch] The recent skyrocketing gold prices in various places, including Beijing and Shanghai, have triggered a sharp rise in commodity prices in the inland areas. In Rugao, kerosene prices have increased more than tenfold in recent days, foreign goods have increased by 40% to 50%, and fabrics and general merchandise have increased by 30% to 40% and 50% to 60%. Although the Shanghai gold price has fallen recently, merchants are using transportation difficulties as an excuse to continue raising prices on all incoming goods. In these difficult end-of-year times, the lives of ordinary people are greatly affected.

### Strict Prohibition of Disguised Levies in the Recovered Areas of Northern Jiangsu, Smooth Transportation from Nantong to Dongtai Yancheng

[Our Newspaper Zhenjiang Dispatch on the 4th] According to reports: Although the recovered areas of Northern Jiangsu are said to be exempt from taxes, the counties are short of funds due to the initial stage of restoration, and the expenses are huge. It is still inevitable that there will be incidents of forced levies, causing many wealthy shops that fled to Jiangnan to remain hesitant and unwilling to return home and resume business. The authorities believe that this matter greatly affects the entire industrial and commercial sector and the rural economy of Northern Jiangsu. They have sent personnel to secretly investigate in various counties and strictly prohibit disguised levies.

[Our Newspaper Zhenjiang Dispatch on the 4th] After the recovery of the salt-producing areas, the Tongyu Highway has continued to extend northward by more than 100 kilometers from Dongtai under the joint efforts of the national army's engineering corps and the local government.

However, the rural areas of Yancheng and Huai'an have suffered the most damage, and winter cultivation has been delayed by half, requiring urgent relief.

### First Meeting of the New US Congress, Martin Elected Speaker of the House, Calls for Bipartisan Cooperation to Solve Various Problems, Senator Bilbo's Bribery Becomes the Target of Public Criticism

[Central News Agency Washington Dispatch on the 3rd] The 80th US Congress officially opened today, with sessions in both the Senate and the House of Representatives. Members were sworn in and vowed to handle national affairs in accordance with the US Constitution for the next two years. The venue was divided into two rooms, with more than a thousand spectators. The opening of Congress began with a prayer ceremony, followed by speeches by various members and the introduction of many proposals, which will be the subject of investigation and heated debate in the coming months. After the formal ceremony, both houses will hear President Truman's year-end State of the Union address. However, the biggest performance in American politics is the issue of Senator Bilbo's retention in the Senate, which is the biggest issue raised in the Senate on the opening day of Congress, overshadowing all other important issues. The visitor seats and diplomatic staff seats were all full, and their attention was focused on Bilbo rather than the opening ceremony.

[Associated Press Washington Dispatch on the 3rd] The 80th US Congress opened today, and the Republican Party, after fifteen years in the wilderness, regained control of the House of Representatives amidst shouts. Martin was elected Speaker, and a 20% reduction in income tax was proposed as the first bill. A commotion broke out in the Senate when Missouri Democratic Senator Bilbo was sworn in. As Bilbo was approaching the podium to be sworn in, he was blocked by Idaho Democratic Senator Taylor and returned to his seat. Taylor proposed not to recognize Bilbo's qualification as a senator, saying that his certificate was stained with fraud. Democratic senators from the southern states stood up to defend Bilbo, and Louisiana Democratic Senator Overton proposed to allow Bilbo to be sworn in, leading to a fierce debate. In the afternoon, Ohio Republican Senator Taft proposed to dismiss the motion against Bilbo, which passed by a vote of 38 to 20. The new Republican senators were then sworn in, while Bilbo must be sworn in after his certificate is reviewed by the Senate Rules Committee.

[Agence France-Presse Washington Dispatch on the 4th] Republican senators have issued an ultimatum to the Democratic minority, saying that if Democratic senators continue to obstruct the expulsion of Senator Bilbo from the Senate, they will amend the Senate's rules of procedure. It is reported that Bilbo was reprimanded by the Senate Investigation Committee for intimidating a person and prohibiting blacks from voting. At that time, two major Republican senators, Taft and Morse, said that the debate was lengthy and impatient, and the majority party would have to amend the rules of procedure.

[Agence France-Presse Washington Dispatch on the 3rd] US House Speaker Martin said in his inaugural address that the government should immediately stop interfering in the private affairs of the people, and the system of the people supervising the government should be restored immediately. The current American system has made the United States the greatest country in history, and there is no room for a system that accommodates communism in the US government. In short, the government should reduce spending, and the Republican and Democratic parties should work together, he said. When Speaker Martin spoke, applause was continuous, and the anti-Roosevelt and anti-communist sentiment in the US House of Representatives can also be seen here.

### Two Parties Launch Public Campaign to Amend Labor Law

[Associated Press Washington Dispatch on the 3rd] Members of Congress from both major US parties today launched a public campaign to prevent strikes that affect public health or safety, such as coal mine strikes. However, this campaign will face strong opposition, and labor groups and large industrial circles will strongly oppose any proposals to force the resolution of labor disputes without allowing strikes or lockouts. Democratic Congressman Smith has proposed a certain labor bill, saying that public interests must be valued, and it would be wrong to pay too much attention to the special wishes of labor or industry. Smith's bill stipulates that in the event of labor disputes in various most important industries, compulsory arbitration should be enforced, prohibiting store closures and collective bargaining for the entire industry. Five Republican members have proposed another method, stipulating that compulsory arbitration should be implemented in industries that affect public health and safety. According to Massachusetts Representative Herde, we firmly believe in the necessity of this bill, and otherwise, it will be impossible to protect public interests. Compulsory arbitration is to resolve the dispute between the two parties by a third party. Michigan Republican Senator Ferguson has drafted a bill that will directly resolve labor disputes through the labor court, believing that the proposal for compulsory arbitration has less chance of passing, and it is easier to pass a bill that only restricts labor unions in various ways without depriving them of the right to strike. Congress will amend the labor law in some way within three months, which is practically certain, but whether strikes will be prohibited is another matter.

I and you both have the same idea, that if you defeat us by force, even if you win, you will tarnish your dignity. We still have the opportunity to achieve a just peace. I frankly and openly dare to state to you that it is heartbreaking to see French and Vietnamese youths killing each other. Admiral Thierry d'Argenlieu, the French High Commissioner in Vietnam, is "a general who loves war."

[Central News Agency Paris Dispatch on the 3rd] French Colonial Minister Moutet did not discuss a peaceful resolution with Viet Government Chairman Ho Chi Minh during his 24-hour inspection of the conflict in the Hanoi area. He declined to state why he did not meet with Ho Chi Minh.

Cunningham may have requested the Cabinet to approve a full-scale offensive against Jewish underground resistance fighters. Montgomery recently inspected Palestine, so his participation in the meeting is of great significance. A spokesman for the Jewish Agency said: All government officials know that if the Palestinian army is dispatched, the last hope of reconciliation between Britain and the Arabs and Jews will be eliminated.

[Agence France-Presse London Dispatch on the 3rd] British Commissioner for Palestine Cunningham is scheduled to succeed General Barker as Commander of British Forces in Palestine on February 1.

### An Old Man in the Soviet Union Accumulates Huge Wealth Through Begging

[Associated Press Moscow Dispatch on the 4th] Today's newspaper reported that Vasilyev, a 71-year-old Moscow beggar, has accumulated private wealth of 260,000 rubles after begging on the streets for many years. The old beggar was originally a monk and begged in Moscow's Belokov Square, arousing suspicion, so an investigation was launched. It was learned that he was a farmer in a collective farm near Vologda City from 1930 to 1940. Dissatisfied with the status quo, he sneaked to Moscow to beg and was only discovered now.

### Scenery of Delhi, the Capital of India

Delhi is the capital of India, and everyone who has been there feels that there are particularly many bicycles, making it one of the best in the Far East. During commuting hours, the streets are filled with bicycles, and the riders are all dressed in white, creating a unique scene. In fact, Delhi is two cities: New Delhi and Old Delhi, separated by five miles, but there is no clear boundary between them, so a newcomer has no way of knowing whether they are in the new city or the old city. The total population of the two areas is approaching one million.

Returning to Normal

All the wartime military activities have vanished with the end of the war. Delhi was originally the headquarters of the U.S. China-Burma-India Theater, where U.S. troops were gathered. Now, some have returned home, and others have been transferred. General Stilwell's headquarters was once located there, but he did not stay there often, preferring to live in Chongqing, where the climate was cooler, or in the tents of the northern Burmese jungle. Today, only 50 U.S. military personnel remain in Delhi, responsible for handling the remaining U.S. military supplies.

Many white, single-story houses in the city center, which used to serve as U.S. military headquarters, have now been converted into offices for the British military and civil government. The "Curzon" barracks, once famous during the war, where many American soldiers sweated profusely and spent several years, has now been converted into the meeting place of the Indian Constituent Assembly.

Since the end of the war, prices in some parts of India have fallen, but Delhi is an exception. The cost of living has not only remained high but has continued to rise.

Juma Masjid Mosque

Among the many attractions in Delhi, one of the most attractive to tourists is the "Red Fort." The fort was built in the 15th century, and the world-famous golden throne of the Peacock Dynasty was once located there. Behind the throne were two peacocks, with tails inlaid with diamonds, rubies, sapphires... a display of extreme luxury and splendor. Another building of particular interest is the "Juma Masjid" (Pearl Mosque), also a relic of the 15th century, and highly regarded in the Muslim world.

New Delhi, however, was created by the British. The architectural style is modern European. The Governor-General Wavell governs four million people of India there. In general, the Indian people recognize him as a good Governor-General and hope that he will be the last Governor-General. The government buildings are magnificent and grand, full of Indian color. The only regret is that around these huge buildings are gathered thousands of poor people struggling on the verge of starvation.

Brown and Healthy

India is located near the equator, with strong sunlight. Therefore, white skin often becomes covered with a layer of oily tan. In Europe, women consider tanned skin fashionable, believing it to be a sign of health and beauty. But in India, no one likes this color. Women always wrap themselves tightly when going out to protect themselves from the sun. Is this due to the geographical environment? Or is it due to the contempt for people of color?

[Report from Our Newspaper] The conveners of all committees of the Municipal Senate held their third joint meeting at the Senate at 3:00 PM yesterday to discuss the agenda of the second general assembly and to draw lots for the seating arrangements of the senators. The meeting was presided over by Speaker Pan Gongzhan, and a total of 26 senators attended. The agenda of the general assembly was decided as follows:

January 6th, 9:00 AM to 10:00 AM: Commemorative Week and opening ceremony. 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM: First meeting, after the Mayor's policy report, senators will raise questions.

When the Second General Assembly of the Senate holds its opening ceremony, Chinese and foreign guests will be invited to attend and observe.

Seating Arrangements of Senators Have Been Decided by Drawing Lots

Regarding the seating arrangements of the senators, Lu Shidao, Tong Xingbai, and Shen Dingsan were publicly elected at the joint meeting yesterday to draw lots to decide. The joint meeting also discussed the handling of proposals. As of yesterday, the Senate had received a total of 58 proposals. It was decided that the deadline for collecting proposals for the General Assembly would be the 5th of this month, and any proposals received after the 6th would be treated as temporary motions. At the same time, the opinion of Senator Wang Weisui was adopted, that each committee, when reviewing reports or proposals, should prepare a general report, and divide the proposals into the most important, secondary, urgent, and delayed matters, and then submit them to the General Assembly for discussion, to save the General Assembly's time. In addition, Senator Tang Shichang proposed that the review of proposals should no longer conclude with "consideration for handling," but should put forward specific measures for the municipal government authorities, otherwise, the municipal government could formulate its own regulations for handling, which would be completely different from the decisions of the General Assembly, losing the spirit of the General Assembly, just as the authorities' handling of restrictions on electricity and cremation were quite unfair.

The Municipal Budget for This Year Is Considered Too Large

During the meeting, Senator Fei Shusheng expressed his opinion on the municipal government's budget for the 36th year, believing that the budget amount was too large and unreasonable. Compared with Nanjing, Nanjing's budget for this year is only over 200 million yuan. The ratio of the population and area of Nanjing to Shanghai is 1:4, while the ratio of Shanghai's budget is 1:10. Therefore, it is hoped that the municipal government's administrative expenses should be reduced as much as possible, and the number of reviewers and their need should be requested. Speaker Pan immediately reported on the joint meeting of the Finance and Budget Committees, believing that it was necessary to give careful consideration to the municipal government's budget for the 36th year. The Finance and Budget Committees are scheduled to hold another meeting today to study this issue. Regarding the municipal government's subscription to policy regulations, the municipal government will be notified to pay attention. In the future, they must be reviewed by the Senate before they can be announced and implemented.

### Propose to Stipulate Principles for Policy Implementation and Revision of Regulations

Senator Pang Jingzhou also put forward a temporary motion, saying that the general public believes that the Municipal Senate is close to the Municipal Government and does not represent public opinion, which is regrettable. The Municipal Senate must clearly understand its responsibilities in the future, serve the citizens, and sympathize with the citizens. Therefore, it is proposed to stipulate the basic principles of the city's recent municipal measures and revised regulations as the scope of discussion for this session of the General Assembly and to live up to the expectations of the people. The methods are roughly divided into: A. Matters related to municipal administration and reform: (1) Those that have a direct relationship with the interests and livelihoods of the people should be discussed first. (2) The construction of beautifying the city and pursuing the standards of European and American metropolises should not be discussed. (3) Emergency projects that must be started immediately should be specially studied. (4) The municipal government's budget should underestimate the people's ability to pay taxes, and the procedures should be simplified. B. The spirit of revising general regulations: (1) The original regulations that are effective should not be changed too much. (2) The method of execution should intend to avoid severity. (3) Single control orders and police regulations should be mainly persuasive. It was decided that item A in the method should be adopted by the Budget Committee, and item B should be adopted by the Regulations Committee.

### Vegetable Vendors on Yangzhou Road Petition, Requesting Permission to Delay Relocation Slightly

[Report from Our Newspaper] The vegetable vendors on Yangzhou Road in this city, because the Yulin Road Police Station ordered them to relocate and concentrate their business on Xuchang Road, which is located in a remote area and affects their livelihood during the year, specially sent representatives Wang Jinyun and others to the Municipal Senate at 4:30 PM yesterday to petition, requesting an extension until after the end of the lunar year before relocation. Senator Cui Yongxiang received them and reported to the joint meeting for discussion. It was approved that the vegetable vendors' request be granted, and a letter was sent to the Police Station to allow the postponement until the end of the year before relocation.

### Tiered Collection of Banquet Tax, Restaurant Industry Expresses Opposition

The Shanghai Wine and Vegetable Commercial Guild and the responsible persons of 520 Chinese and Western restaurants in the city, in order to support the central government's revised and promulgated new law on banquet and entertainment taxes and oppose Mayor Wu's proposal to the Municipal Senate to collect banquet taxes according to the business equipment of restaurants, classified into A and B levels, issued an urgent notice yesterday, stating that the various restaurant guilds in the city will gather at 8:00 AM on the 6th of this month and prepare to go to the Municipal Senate at 9:00 AM on the morning of that day to petition all senators during the second session of the General Assembly.

### Private Hospitals in This City Appeal for Exemption from Taxes

Regarding the issue of the Ministry of Finance and the Municipal Government of this city levying business tax and income tax on hospitals in Shanghai, the private hospitals in this city believe that after the victory, the population of Shanghai has increased sharply, and the number of patients is increasing daily. Hospitals are inherently charitable and provide relief, and the fees are extremely low. Poor patients are treated free of charge, resulting in unusually difficult funding. Therefore, the Shanghai Hospital Federation stated the reasons and submitted them to the Executive and Legislative Branches, the Ministry of Finance, and the Department of Health, appealing for exemption.

### The Process of Wang Renshan's Surrender Reported to the Ministry of National Defense

[Report from Our Newspaper] Wang Renshan, the chief culprit in the explosion case of the Jiangwan Ordnance Medical Team in the First Supply Region of the Logistics Command and the director of the branch depot, surrendered himself late at night on New Year's Day. After interrogation by the relevant authorities for several days, Wang confessed that he fled out of fear of crime and went to Puyang, Hebei Province. There were no other new findings. It is reported that the Shanghai East Investigation Office of the Garrison Command, which assisted in the investigation, will investigate and verify the facts based on Wang Renshan's confession. The First Supply Region Command has reported Wang's surrender to the Ministry of National Defense, and will send him to Nanjing for investigation if necessary. The full conclusion of the case is still pending the return of the two missing warehouse managers, Wu Rulian and Chen Hanwen.

### Sino-British Airmail Can Arrive in One Week

According to post office news: Mail to the United Kingdom is now transported by China National Aviation Corporation planes from Shanghai to Calcutta, and then transferred to British Overseas Airways to London. China National Aviation Corporation has two flights a week, and British planes have eight flights a week, so airmail from Shanghai to London takes only five to seven days, which is extremely fast. In addition to carrying airmail to various parts of the United Kingdom, this airmail service can also carry mail to other European countries, including the Soviet Union, to London and then forward it to various countries. However, it is necessary to affix sufficient airmail postage to the United Kingdom (currently 650 yuan in national currency per five grams). In addition, for airmail to the Soviet Union, if the sender still wishes to send it to the Ha'a Line (Hami to Almaty in the Soviet Union) as before, they can indicate (By Hami—Alma Ata Air Line) on the envelope, and the post office can also do so.

In the case of the fisherman's mate Rogers stabbing the pedicab driver Cheng Rongfang, the perpetrator Rogers was transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for interrogation by the Tilanqiao Police Station at 2:00 PM on the 3rd. Because it was a holiday, the on-duty prosecutor Quan Tao accepted the case, interrogated him briefly, and detained him in the District Prosecutor's Office detention center. According to Prosecutor Quan yesterday, the perpetrator who stabbed the pedicab driver Cheng Rongfang has been accepted by this office, and the US Consulate has been notified yesterday in accordance with international practice.

After the prosecutor in charge of the case is determined by the Prosecutor's Office, the interrogation will continue, and a public prosecution will be filed.

In addition, the highest American naval authorities stationed in Shanghai issued a statement yesterday, pointing out that the stabbing of the pedicab driver Cheng Rongfang has nothing to do with the American naval authorities. The fisherman Rogers is not a member of the American navy.

### Ambiguous Relationship Between Classmates, Unsuccessful Mediation Leads to Lawsuit

[Report from Our Newspaper] Wang Qiuliang, a 19-year-old youth from Wuxi, lives at No. 268 Haifang Road, Shanghai West. Chen Meiling, a 17-year-old girl from Suzhou (lives at No. 4, Lane 278, the same road), had a classmate and neighbor relationship. They went in and out together, and their affection exceeded the norm, eventually leading to intimacy. On July 11th last autumn, Wang took Meiling to Pudong to live together for several months until December 27th, when they returned to Shanghai together, accompanying Meiling to her brother Qilin's home, and explaining that they were in love with each other and willing to fulfill their lifelong commitment. Qilin then sent Meiling to her mother, Chen Li's, home for one night, and then her mother accompanied Meiling to her cousin Lu Xiuyue's home at No. 51, Meifang Lane, Changshou Road, for a short stay, and entrusted her to persuade Meiling to sever her relationship with Qiuliang. However, Meiling was passionately in love and suddenly escaped on the evening of New Year's Day, taking refuge with her close friend on Macau Road. Later, her mother, Li, found out and thought she had been seduced again, and went to Qiuliang's house to make a scene, and grabbed and beat his mother, causing both parties to be taken to the Jiangning Branch, and the bureau summoned both the male and female protagonists to the case. Later, because the mediation was unsuccessful, they were transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation.

### Coal Price Review Meeting Resolves That Retail Sales of Coal Balls by Each Coal Ball Factory Shall Be Subject to Supervision and Inspection; Coal Cinder Delivered Can Only Be Used to Manufacture Coal Balls

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Coal Price Review Committee held a meeting yesterday afternoon at the Bureau of Social Affairs and resolved the following important issues: (1) The principle of coal ball allocation and the allocation ratio. It was resolved that: 1. If each coal ball factory has a retail department that operates retail sales, its retail business shall be subject to the supervision and inspection of the Review Committee, and the joint office of retail representatives may be entrusted by the Review Committee to assist in handling. 2. The transactions of the retail business of each factory's retail department shall not be in units of tons, otherwise, the right to retail sales will be canceled. 3. The wholesale volume of each factory's wholesale business shall be more than one ton. 4. The coal ball distribution ratio is 35% for Guohua due to special circumstances, and 20% for the rest. The above standards will be tried once, and if each party believes that adjustments are necessary, it will be submitted to the Review Committee for discussion. (2) The coal ball retailers' distribution method will be formulated by the joint office of retailers and submitted to the Review Committee for discussion. The retail portion of each factory should also follow this distribution method. (3) The coal balls manufactured by each factory through self-mining and self-transportation, in addition to the cost price being negotiated separately, retailers also have the right to enjoy the proportional distribution and sales determined this time. (4) Supervision methods for the production of coal ball raw materials: 1. After the coal cinder allocated to each factory by the Fuel Management Committee is transported to the factory, it should be reported to this Committee immediately for verification. This coal cinder is only for the manufacture of coal balls and shall not be transported out of the factory. All of these shall be supervised by this Committee. If there is any violation, it will be submitted to the meeting for handling. 2. Each time the white coal cinder is received from the Fuel Management Committee, this Committee will send personnel to the factory to extract coal samples for testing to determine the standard of B.T.U. (the heat unit of coal). 3. Each time coal balls are made, it should be reported to this Committee, and this Committee will send personnel to the factory to extract samples and send them to the Fuel Management Committee laboratory for testing. If the B.T.U. of the coal balls is exactly half of the tested coal sample, it meets the standard. Those that do not meet the standard will be submitted to the meeting for handling. 4. After each factory receives coal and manufactures coal balls, it should report the quantity manufactured to this Committee for review.

### Cultural Merchant Detained for Raping Friend's Daughter

[Report from Our Newspaper] Li Yixin, a Jin Hua native, is forty years old and runs Kongshan Bookstore at No. 719 Beijing West Road. In August of the year before last, because his family had many children and no one to take care of them, he discussed it with his friend Xie Youde (from Changshu, living at No. 32, Hongfuxing, Xinza Road), requesting his daughter Yilin (16 years old, studying at Dajiang Middle School on Xinzha Road) to stay at his home to take care of chores and look after the children. At that time, Xie had no suspicions and readily agreed. Until March of last spring, when Li's wife returned to her hometown in Jinhua, Li raped the girl at midnight, and then repeatedly thereafter. Unexpectedly, a month later, her mother, Han, found out and called her daughter home, and interrogated her harshly. The girl then revealed the truth. After several negotiations with Li, Li hired Xu Fubao, a peddler, to mediate, willing to pay 2 million legal currency to settle the matter, and made a written statement as proof. However, after delaying for a long time, he never paid it. On New Year's Day, her mother led her daughter to Hongren Hospital, where it was confirmed that her hymen had been broken. The hospital then reported to the Xincheng Branch, which sent police to rush to the scene and brought the two to the branch for interrogation, and then sent them to the judicial authorities for verification.

### Schools Held Classes as Usual Yesterday, Only a Few Students from Jiaotong University and Other Schools Continued to Publicize in the Streets; The Student Self-Government Association of Datong University Issued a Solemn Statement

[Report from Our Newspaper] The student community in this city has expressed indignation at the incident of American soldiers in Beiping insulting female university students. A few days ago, various university student unions issued declarations one after another to express their protest and urge the government to file a protest and demand punishment for the perpetrator. At the same time, because this matter is purely a legal case, it should be resolved through proper diplomatic channels. Therefore, it does not advocate taking strike actions or other irrelevant actions to avoid increasing difficulties and neglecting studies. However, a few students have spontaneously organized a "Committee to Protest American Military Atrocities" to launch strikes and parades, hoping to expand the situation.

Yesterday was the first day after the New Year holiday. Most schools in this city have resumed classes as usual, but a few students from Jiaotong University and other schools who participated in the "Shanghai Student Federation to Protest American Military Atrocities" implemented a "general leave" for one day to engage in publicity work, dividing into several groups to go to universities, middle schools, and elementary schools in this city that have not participated in the association to launch publicity and signature campaigns to win over the masses, but the students of each school were unmoved.

It is reported that the student self-government associations of various universities believe that the so-called "Committee to Protest American Military Atrocities" is only organized by a few students and is not enough to represent the school. In addition to the Fudan Self-Government Association's early statement, the Datong University Self-Government Association also issued a statement yesterday stating: "This Association is deeply indignant at the atrocities committed by American soldiers in Beiping this time. In addition to publishing a letter to students, it has also decided to convene a general assembly of all representatives on the 6th of this month. However, regarding the establishment of the so-called "Datong University Student Support Committee Against American Atrocities," this Association was not informed in advance, nor was it consulted afterward, and the association is only organized by a few students, and its actions cannot represent this school. We hereby solemnly declare."

[Also Reported] The New Year holidays of various schools in this city ended yesterday. All universities, except for Jiaotong University, which has not fully resumed classes, have resumed classes and are preparing for the semester exams. The situation is calm as usual. Student organizations such as the Guanghua Political Research Association, the Fudan Political Society, and the Datong University General Branch, and schools such as Mingde Girls' High School, Dezhi Middle School, and Minli Girls' High School, in response to the joint declaration of student organizations, issued a statement yesterday, which roughly stated that "We hope that our students will recognize the situation, distinguish between right and wrong, and not be incited by a few people to participate in strikes, parades, and riots, so as not to neglect their studies, or even damage their bodies, causing unfortunate consequences and being criticized" and so on.

### Numerous Robberies in Cold Weather: A Thief, Recently Released from Prison, Is Shot and Captured

[Reported by This Newspaper] At around 9:25 AM yesterday, five robbers arrived at the Kombu Factory Distribution Office at No. 6, Lane 599, Zhejiang Middle Road. Two of them stood guard at the entrance, while the remaining robbers entered the building and falsely claimed to be from Fujian to buy cloth. Suddenly, they pulled out guns and threatened the owner, Xia Zhifang, and the shop assistants, driving them into the back room. They began searching after covering them with cotton blankets. As a result, they robbed one large gold bar, 600,000 yuan in cash, three gold rings, one raincoat, one melton robe, one watch, and two pens, and then fled. Afterwards, the owner reported the incident to the Lao Zha Sub-bureau, and Sub-bureau Chief Shi Sijian immediately ordered Section Chief Jiang to lead officers to search the area near the scene of the incident. However, they found no trace of the robbers, but they did discover a fingerprint, which is currently under strict investigation.

At 10:00 AM yesterday, three robbers also occurred at the intersection of Gujia Lane and Beijing Road, and they held up Chuan Ming, a 15-year-old apprentice at a rice store. They stole 3,000,000 yuan in cash and a check for 6,400,000 yuan. The robbers fled westward after pushing the apprentice aside, but the apprentice pursued them, shouting "Robbers!" One of the robbers fled to the intersection of Guizhou Road, where he was apprehended by guard officer No. 3345. During the arrest, the robber resisted by drawing a gun, so the police officer fired a shot, hitting his left shoulder. After being taken back to the Lao Zha Police Station, he identified himself as Li Zhixue, 38 years old, from Jiangbei. He had a long criminal record and had been sentenced to ten years in prison, having just been released recently. Because the robber's wound was bleeding profusely, he was escorted to the police hospital for treatment. At the same time, an accomplice in the case, named Xu Jiangong, was arrested at the Xiamen Road intersection. Another escaped robber was still being pursued as of the evening.

At approximately 1:30 AM yesterday, three robbers broke into No. 463 Huaide Road, Shanghai East. Two of them were armed with Mauser pistols, ordering everyone not to make a sound. They stole 930,000 yuan in legal tender and other items of clothing.

At the Racecourse Apartments, six robbers also broke into the home of a Rong family at the apartment on the afternoon before yesterday. They stole three diamond rings, two taels of gold, a gold pocket watch with a gold chain, and overcoats, resulting in a loss of approximately 5,000,000 yuan.

### Unemployed Workers Returning from Abroad: Living in the Reception Center, Passing the Time Eating and Sleeping, Waiting for Tomorrow with Vague Expectations

[Reported by This Newspaper] Workers who were deceived and forcibly conscripted by the Japanese in the past, or captured and transported abroad to do hard labor, are now returning to the country one after another. Traveling tens of thousands of miles, some worked in the snow-capped coal mines around Hokkaido, while others served as forced laborers in Southeast Asia, Burma, and Australia. Life was full of danger, bloodshed, sweat, hunger, cold, and whipping. After enduring this inhuman life of darkness, they have returned to their homeland. Their lives seem to have been snatched from the clutches of death.

After returning to the country, this group of workers is sent by the port headquarters to the relief sub-office, which then transfers them to the "Reception Center for Unemployed Workers Returning from Abroad" for shelter. Since its establishment on April 1st of last year, the reception center has first taken in more than 80 workers who returned from Japan. Later, workers stranded in Australia and Burma also returned to the country one after another. A total of more than 300 people have been accommodated, more than 100 of whom have already been sent back to their hometowns or introduced to jobs. There are still more than 160 people living in the reception center. The expenses of the reception center are allocated by the municipal government, and some food and clothing are provided by the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration. There are more than 30 rooms of various sizes, each accommodating five to six or seven to eight people. Their lives, apart from three meals a day, are spent sitting idly and sleeping. The rooms are poorly lit, the air is turbid, and the bedding and belongings are piled up in disarray, but for them, it is a temporary respite after a long period of hardship.

Respite is respite, but they still need to work. Apart from a dozen or so female workers, most of them are strong men, and this kind of stagnant and rigid life is a waste of energy.

They hope to find a career in their homeland, to get a job, but their homes have been destroyed and they cannot return home. Their jobs seem even more distant. This life that has been snatched back is not a happy one, and there are countless twists and turns and hardships to come.

Their only goal is to find work, but they lack specialized skills, and the domestic industry and commerce are in recession. There is a surplus of labor, and it is difficult to make progress. They can only pass each day eating and sleeping, waiting for each tomorrow with vague expectations.

The establishment of the reception center is commendable, but it lacks a rational organization and a positive driving force. If the strength of these workers were transferred to production, there would still be a need for manpower in the country. If they lack specialized skills, they should take this opportunity to strengthen training. At the very least, their lives should be more regular and orderly, which seems to be a point that the reception center has neglected.

[Reported by This Newspaper] The amnesty decree was formally promulgated by the National Government on New Year's Day. Although the local judicial authorities have not received detailed implementation measures, the scope of this amnesty is extensive. Except for those who have violated Articles 2, 3, and 4 of the Regulations for the Punishment of Traitors, Articles 2, 3, 5, and 8 of the Regulations for the Punishment of Corruption, those who have murdered direct ascendants, and those who have committed crimes under the Provisional Regulations for the Punishment of Drug and Opium Offenses that are specifically subject to the death penalty or life imprisonment, all crimes committed before December 31, 1946, for which the heaviest sentence is imprisonment for a term of years or less, are subject to amnesty. There are approximately 500 ordinary criminal cases currently under investigation by the local district court's procuratorate. Most of these cases will be eligible for the grace of amnesty.

### Female Secret Agent Gu Gu Xue Jinnuo: After Trial, Still Released on Original Bail

[Reported by This Newspaper] Zhan Zhan Xue Jinnuo is a Soviet female citizen, 26 years old, who works as a hostess at the "Qiao Qiao Paishi" bar on Lin Sen Middle Road. She is accused of providing information to the Japanese during the occupation of Shanghai. She was tried at the High Court yesterday afternoon. According to her testimony, she came to Shanghai from Harbin in 1940 and initially lived with an Italian sailor named Le Lai. In 1942, Le Lai was detained in a concentration camp by the Japanese army, and she became a secret agent under the Japanese spy Yuegong at the "Qiao Qiao Paishi" bar on Lin Sen Middle Road. She firmly denied having contact with high-ranking Japanese military and political officials. Regarding the fact that the Soviet consulate refused to issue a certificate of proof, she argued that if the Soviet consulate considered her actions suspicious, it had the right to revoke her passport, so there was no need to issue a separate certificate. At the end of the trial, it was announced that the owner of the "Qiao Qiao Paishi" bar would need to be summoned to testify, and the defendant remained on her original bail. When Zhan Zhan Xue Jinnuo left the courtroom, Mona Tuo followed closely behind, appearing quite intimate.

### Year-End Bonus Disputes: Still Unresolved in the Silk Weaving Industry; Standards Set in the Cigarette Industry

[Reported by This Newspaper] The year-end bonus issue in the Shanghai silk weaving industry has not been resolved as of yesterday. The employers are sticking to their previous proposal. The workers' demands have changed slightly, requesting that those who have worked for less than three months be given a six-day year-end bonus, with one more day added for each additional month of service. Those who have worked for nine months should be given eleven days, and those who have worked for ten months or more should be given twelve days. The Bureau of Social Affairs is drafting a compromise plan and is doing its best to mediate. However, the two silk factories of the China Silk Company have reached an agreement in principle on the year-end bonus issue. The two parties agreed that workers who have worked for less than one month will not receive a year-end bonus, and those who have worked for one month will receive a temporary payment of 135,000 yuan. Also, the two factories have been on strike since December 28 of last year, and the public has suffered heavy losses as a result. Therefore, wages will not be paid during this period, but holidays will be paid as usual. As for the exact amount of the year-end bonus, it will be issued in accordance with the standards of the private silk industry after the issue is resolved.

[Reported by This Newspaper] The year-end bonus dispute in the Shanghai cigarette industry has been resolved, except for the Yizhong, Huacheng, Zhonghua, and Fuxin factories, which have resolved the issue themselves. The general standards have been set by the Bureau of Social Affairs as follows: (1) Those who have signed written records will continue to fulfill them in accordance with the written records. (2) Male and female daily-wage workers and monthly-wage workers will receive a bonus equal to 30 days' pay. If there are special profits, an additional 15 days will be added, but this should be distributed in proportion to the December pay. (3) The year-end bonus for female piece-rate workers will be 5% to 9.5% of their total annual income (calculated based on the cost of living index in December of last year).

### Symphony Orchestra to Suspend? Mayor Wu Clarifies Denial

[Our Dispatch] Due to the municipal government's failure to pay salaries for one and a half months, the city's symphony orchestra musicians refused to participate in performances, leading to the cancellation of concerts at the Lyceum Theatre for the past two weeks. Numerous rumors circulated, including the orchestra's potential closure due to municipal funding shortages this year. Yesterday, our reporter met with Mayor Wu to inquire about the validity of these claims. Mayor Wu responded that there was absolutely no such thing. The symphony orchestra is the only cultural and musical group of the municipal government and must be maintained. Regarding the salary arrears of one and a half months, it is true, but there are special reasons. It is not due to the city's lack of funds that it could not be released on schedule, because there were some problems with the internal accounts of the group, and the municipal authorities are sorting it out. The reporter further asked whether it was possible that the current principal of the National Conservatory of Music, Dai Cuilun, would take over as the head of the symphony orchestra. The response was: This is possible. The municipal government has had preliminary discussions with Mr. Dai and has already submitted a report to the Ministry of Education. If the Ministry of Education approves his concurrent position, then with Mr. Dai's qualifications and achievements in music, he will certainly be able to fulfill the role happily.

It is also learned that the municipal symphony orchestra received the second half of November's salary a few days ago, and last month's salary will also be received within days. Therefore, today's Sunday concert will be held as usual at the Lyceum Theater at 5:00 pm. The program includes a solo performance by soprano Aili, Mrs. Magolinski. (Mrs. Ma is from Vienna, and her mother is a professor at the Vienna State Opera.) As well as Mozart's Croupierini song, Annie's Romance, G minor symphony, etc.

### Airplane Accidents and Weather - Director of the Central Meteorological Bureau

— Lü Jiong

Unfortunately, there have been two airplane accidents last month. The first one was reported in the Shanghai News on the 14th of last month:

The passenger plane XT-T26 on the Ping-Hu route flew from Beijing to Shanghai on the afternoon of the 14th, carrying 33 boxes of banknotes, totaling 1.2 billion yuan, five boxes of gold, and a Jeep. At 4 p.m., it arrived in Changxing, but due to bad weather, it could not continue to fly. It seemed to intend to land at Changxing Airport, so it circled several times over the county, but at that time it encountered strong winds and heavy rain, and the sky was dark, causing it to collide with Bingshan Mountain. The fuselage caught fire, and the pilot and two passengers were all killed. Some of the legal tender inside the plane fluttered in the wind for more than ten miles... Also, China Airlines Flight 67 flew from Beijing to Shanghai at 5:20 pm that afternoon and landed at Longhua Airport. Due to the excessive wind, it collided with other parked airplanes in the field, fortunately no major disaster occurred...

The second airplane accident was on the 25th of last month, reported in the Shanghai News:

On the 25th, it was drizzling and foggy all day in this city (Shanghai). The fog was so thick that it was difficult to see anything beyond five feet. Due to this bad weather, three passenger planes crashed at the same time. Two of them were China Airlines passenger planes flying from Chongqing to Shanghai, and one was a Central Airlines passenger plane. ...China Airlines flight 140 could not find the airport due to the dense fog. After circling for more than an hour, it was forced to land due to running out of fuel. With a loud crash, the plane crashed to the ground and caught fire. The nose and front of the plane were completely shattered... Another China Airlines passenger plane, No. 115, also took off from Chongqing, with 33 passengers. When it arrived over Shanghai, the weather was so bad that it was destroyed outside the airport, one mile southwest of the Huangjiadu River Temple Tower. In addition, a Central Airlines C48 passenger plane was also forced to land at the Shanghai North Jiangwan Airport that evening due to bad weather. Due to the difficulty of distinguishing the dense fog, the direction went out of the airport and crashed into a farmer's house near Zhanghuabang, causing a fire.

We analyzed the weather conditions of these two airplane accidents. On the 14th, there was a strong cold wave (that is, a cold air mass) southward, so the wind was strong and the rain was heavy, and the airplane lost control. The reason was that the wind force was too great, and the sky was dark, the Central aircraft actually collided with the mountains, and the China Airlines aircraft collided with other aircraft parked on the ground when landing. The weather in Nanjing was also very bad that day, with a strong northeast wind, which was not suitable for flying. As for the weather conditions on the 24th, it was in the warm front, although the wind was calm and the rain was not strong, but it was drizzling, with dense fog covering the sky, and the visibility was extremely bad, which was also not suitable for flying.

Seven or eight out of ten airplane accidents in our country are due to unfavorable weather. I still remember that Mr. Dai Yunong flew from Qingdao to Beijing in mid-March this year and crashed near Banqiao Town, Jiangyin, due to bad weather, losing his life. However, unfavorable weather conditions are not unavoidable. As long as you can know the overall weather situation in the country that day, you can judge whether the weather is suitable for flying on that day. Generally speaking, the weather that is not suitable for flying is nothing more than the following: (1) When a strong cold wave goes south, the aircraft is difficult to control due to excessive wind force. This type of weather is more likely to occur in the winter half year, especially in winter. Even if the cold wave has just passed and the wind has weakened, but if the high-altitude temperature is too low, you still need to be careful when flying, because there is a danger of icing on the wings of the airplane, especially when traveling northeast or northwest, you must pay extra attention, because the temperature in the north is lower than in the south in winter. (2) When a warm front arrives, although the wind and rain are not strong, dense fog covers the sky, and the visibility is poor, the aircraft is most likely to lose its direction and not be able to find the airport. This type of weather occurs most often in winter and spring. (3) Summer thunderstorms are not suitable for flying. The reason is obvious and does not need to be explained. (4) It is also not suitable to fly within the scope of a typhoon, because the wind and rain are too sudden and it is difficult to control. This type of weather is most likely to occur in summer and autumn. In addition, mountainous areas have more dense fog in winter, and coastal areas can have fog in all seasons, winter, spring, and summer, depending on their location. The above are all common sense of meteorology in our country. As for the fundamental way to protect airplanes, of course, it is not enough to rely on common sense of meteorology. It is necessary to set up meteorological observation stations throughout the country, quickly transmit meteorological communications, and draw weather maps two or three times a day. If the number of times can be increased, it will naturally be better. A meteorological station should be set up on each airport, each station needs more than ten meteorological personnel, and senior personnel should be in charge of weather reports. In addition, airplane drivers should also be instilled with basic meteorological common sense, so that they can understand the changes in ordinary weather and be alert, so as not to take risks. European and American countries have already done this, so airplane accidents caused by weather reasons are rare. It is really too tragic for three airplanes to crash in one day. If the country spends a little more money and does a little meteorological work, thereby reducing the number of airplanes that crash each year and reducing the loss of life and property, I believe it is not a loss, and the effect can be seen immediately.

### Reader Inquiries - Legal Questions

(1) Coercive Eviction

Gui Yun asks: I am a third-hand tenant. Two years ago, I rented two rooms from a second-hand landlord. At that time, the term was one year, and I paid a deposit for six months. After the term expired, I continued to live by increasing the rent. After half a year, the rent was increased again, and a verbal lease was signed for another six months. In fact, it has become an indefinite lease, but now the lease has not yet expired (the rent is paid for six months in advance). The second-hand landlord is actually preparing to move out under the superior conditions of the first-hand landlord's promise to pay his moving expenses and not pursue the rent owed. He must force me to leave the house, but I cannot find a fort for a while, so it has become a stalemate. I have several questions here that I would like to ask for answers: (1) There are no special regulations on renting houses in Suzhou. Now that I cannot find a house to move into, I don't know how long I can live. (2) I prepaid a deposit for six months in September of the 33rd year. Is there any legal conflict in requesting a refund of the deposit now? (3) After the expiration of the contract, a new contract has not been revised since then. Each time the rent is increased and the rent is paid, it is only noted on the original rent book. Can all the conditions stated in the contract not be responsible? Can the guarantor also not be responsible? (4) If I still pay the rent after the term expires, and the second-hand landlord does not accept it, can I deposit the rent due in the bank? So as to prepare for legal negotiations.

[Lawyer Cao Yaxia signs] (1) If the lease has not yet expired and the tenant is forced to move out under a legitimate lease, he can be accused of the crime of violent coercion to move out. (2) Cannot be used as a reason for renewal. (3) Should be regarded as a continuation of the contract with an indefinite term, and the guarantor can not be responsible. (4) You should apply to the court for a deposit in accordance with the law.

Inheritance

Wang Zhongwei asks: A has three daughters. The eldest daughter is recruited as an heir, the second daughter is engaged to B, and the youngest daughter is still unmarried but is also planning to recruit a son-in-law. I would like to ask, regarding A's property inheritance, does the second daughter have the same rights as the first and second daughters?

[Lawyer Cao Yaxia answers] The second daughter has the same rights to inherit property as the first and youngest daughters after the death of her father, but before Mr. A passes away, he has the right to freely use, benefit from, and dispose of his property within the scope of legal restrictions. No one else may interfere.

### Government to Purchase Surplus Yarn and Cloth Factories Can Sell Freely but Cannot Arbitrarily Raise Prices or the Government will Order a Complete Purchase President Song Expressed Sincerity to the Cotton Spinning Industry Yesterday

[Our Dispatch] Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 p.m., President Song of the Executive Yuan convened a talk with all the directors and supervisors of the Machine Cotton Textile Industry Association of the Sixth District at the Executive Yuan Office in the Bank of China Building on the Bund. Wang Qizi, Rong Hongyuan, Shu Yunzhang, Wu Weijing, Guo Dihuo, Liu Guojun, Xi Yushu, and others, totaling eighteen people, attended. Minister Wang of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, Wu concurrently Chairman of the Textile Control Committee, and Liu Wensheng, Director of the Business Department, also attended. First, Wu, concurrently Chairman of the Wuguan Committee, reported: In order to stabilize the market price of yarn and cloth, he has repeatedly negotiated with the Cotton Spinning Association of the Sixth District, and the circumstances of the meeting convened by the Wuguan Committee. The main points are: (1) It was decided to purchase 50% of the cotton production volume of each yarn factory in the Shanghai urban area. (2) The assessed price of the best-grade 20-count standard yarn is 1,975,000 yuan per piece. After Chairman Wu finished his report, President Song immediately asked Wang Qiyu, Chairman of the Sixth District Association, whether the fellow industrialists in the association had any opinions on the new negotiated price agreed by the Textile Control Committee. Wang Chang replied: Each fellow industrialist expressed satisfaction with the new negotiated price.

President Song was quite gratified after listening to Wang's reply and said: From this, it can be seen that each fellow industrialist can cooperate with the government, and the government has actually given the textile industry more special treatment than other industries. In addition to the stipulated profit of 20%, the government must also provide huge amounts of foreign exchange required to purchase foreign cotton. Now that the government has decided to collect half of the yarn and cloth, the remaining half will still be sold freely by each factory on the market. However, it is hoped that the half of the yarn and cloth sold freely must consider the policy of stabilizing prices and cannot be allowed to rise arbitrarily. This is because the price of yarn and cloth has a great impact on other prices. Moreover, the original intention of the government was to purchase all yarn and cloth. Now it only purchases half of it, and its intention is to control the market price of yarn and cloth with this half purchased. If the market price of yarn and cloth still rises sharply in the future, the government can order the purchase of all yarn and cloth at any time, so I hope everyone will cooperate, this is one. Also, each factory once requested to only pay the government the production volume of two months' worth of cotton. President Song entrusted it as a rigid and time-limited regulation, which seemed unfair. The government decided to still collect half of the actual cotton production volume of each factory. From now on, the situation of yarn factories will definitely develop. In the future, no matter how low the price of foreign yarn is, the government will never allow it to be imported, so as to protect the interests and development of our country's textile industry.

Finally, Minister Wang stated: The price of the half of the yarn and cloth sold freely by each factory cannot be too high. At the same time, it is hoped that each factory should pay attention to production costs, for example, wages for workers and treatment for employees cannot be treated excessively without limitation. If production costs can be reduced, they can compete with foreign yarn. The profits gained should not be distributed immediately, but should be used to expand their own equipment. If costs are not taken into account and the treatment of employees is too generous, it will affect other industries.

### Solid Sales Seen Gold Prices Rise Results are 70,000 Higher than Before the Closure

In addition to yesterday's explicit distribution by the Central Bank, there were very few underground sales. During the closure period, solid sales compensated, were firm, and opened in the morning with a leap to 3.55 million. From 3.58 million, some people sold to realize profits, and immediately fell back to within the 2.5 million mark, with the low price reaching 3.46 million and stabilizing. After ten o'clock, the Central Bank distributed 202 taels at a price of 3.48 million. The pressure on the Central Bank was very small. Silver shops and solid sales in various places were heavy, and it rebounded to 3.56 million. Near noon, it hovered between 3.52 million and 3.55 million, and then pulled up to 2.58 million again in the afternoon before stabilizing. As a result, it rose 70,000 from before the closure, ornaments were 375,000, silver dollars were slightly more expensive, and black market interest was between 1 jiao and 5 fen and 1 jiao and 8 fen.

Foreign currency was very stable yesterday. The black market for US dollars initially ranged from 6,300 to 6,500 in the morning, and then ranged from 6,200 to 6,400. In the afternoon, it rose slightly due to the rising spot price of gold, and hovered between 6,300 and 6,500 again, slightly more stable than before the closure. Hong Kong dollars once rose to 1,280 yuan with the price of gold, and finally sold for 1,250 yuan. The result was also dozens of yuan better. Exchange rates were 1,170 yuan to 1,200 yuan, Indian exchange rates were 1,400 yuan, and British exchange rates were around 18,800 yuan. Except for Hong Kong, which was relatively traded around 1,180 yuan, the rest were still mostly available but not marketed.

### Public Bonds Slightly Decline

Public bonds also saw a slight decline yesterday. The Tong Bing opened at 1,450 yuan in the morning. Although 652 rooms were purchased, 360 rooms were sold. From 1,460 yuan, it fell to below 1,420 yuan. As a result, it fell 130 yuan compared to the previous close. Jia and Yi also fell 100 yuan. Tong Ding was flat, while Tong Wu rose 20 yuan. The transaction was about 3 million yuan.

### 42-count Double Strand Yarn Jumped Nearly 100,000

The yarn market rose steadily yesterday. It opened at a low price in the morning, and all parties took risks. 10-count yarn rose slowly by 350,000 yuan, and 32-count yarn was even more popular, about 100,000 yuan. The 42-count double strand yarn was the most outstanding. Under the search of pure weaving factories, it jumped to 100,000 yuan. The trend was firm and the people were happy and prosperous.

### The Tea Market Still Shows No Improvement

Yesterday, all industries resumed trading as usual. The tea market in this street and the Kezhuang from all over the place was still lifeless. As for the foreign company transactions, the green tea such as Zhuzhen Zhenmei, which is mainly sold to French Africa, was the most active, and the selling price was also extremely profitable. The British company Renji Yangzhu watched the high-end Chen Qimen tirelessly. Under the sellers' insistence on scarcity, the process was not clear, and the market remained strong. Other varieties continued to lack improvement. According to people in the industry, Japan is currently preparing to actively sell a second batch of new tea to Casablanca, Africa. If it can be realized, Chinese tea will be further hit.

### Sugar Prices Turn Upward

Yesterday, the sugar market trend turned firm, and all saw improvement. The public association's disk prices for existing white sugar were 141,234,000 yuan, stack orders were 133,457,000 yuan, raw sugar was 127,000 yuan, 65,000 yuan to 78,000 yuan, and stack orders were 120,000 yuan to 122,000 yuan. The increase in stack orders was higher, reaching 56,000 yuan. Other types of goods were also firm. Shunde Qing opened at 118,000 yuan to 120,000 yuan, Tiqing called for 125,000 yuan, Huanggang Qing was 120,000 yuan to 1223,000 yuan, Diao Qing called for 125,000 yuan, Che Baijing was 210,000, Che Baimi was 175,000 yuan, Xinghua Bai was 169,000 yuan to 45,000 yuan, and Xing Chi was 157,000 yuan to 162,000 yuan.

### Rough Yarn Pricing Too High Proportions to be Recalculated

[Our Dispatch] The six-point plan on stabilizing yarn and cloth market prices, after being approved by the Textile Control Committee and reviewed by President Song, was officially implemented on January 1 of this year. Currently, the Textile Control Committee and the Sixth District Cotton Spinning Association are negotiating the procedures and methods for purchase. The purchase price has also been submitted to President Song for review, with the best-grade 20-count standard yarn priced at 1,975,000 yuan per piece. As for the prices of other counts of yarn, the original calculation ratio resulted in a price that was too high for coarse count yarn, which was not in line with the actual situation. Therefore, it was decided that Shu Yunzhang, Wang Qiyu, Wu Weijing, Liu Wensheng, and others will discuss and set a percentage for calculating the prices of each count of yarn today.

### Underground Banks Not Eradicated Funds Escape to Hong Kong Not Prevented Financial Situation Difficult to Improve

According to authoritative sources in the financial industry, in this environment of overall recession, financial institutions with stable operations are spending in a state of relatively high surplus. Looking back at the situation last year, the second half of the year was affected by the recession in the industrial and commercial sector, the dumping of foreign goods, the absorption of floating funds by underground banks and high-interest loans, and the massive escape of Yan Jin to Hong Kong. The financial business was not as prosperous as in the first half of the year. At present, although the authorities have strictly prohibited underground banks and the escape of floating funds to Hong Kong, various parties are still carrying out these bad businesses in a slippery and secret manner. It is not yet possible to predict whether the financial industry will be able to progress and prosper more firmly than last year. It depends on the effectiveness of the crackdown on these two bad businesses, and whether the industrial and commercial sectors can turn around and become active after accepting loans. In short, it depends on whether the decisions of the authorities can achieve results.

### Silk Market Conditions Firm

After three days of market closure, the silk market conditions were quite stable yesterday, with no significant changes. Factory quotes remained unchanged, around 4.8 million yuan for D-grade, and a starting price of 4.5 million yuan for open goods. Canjing was priced at 300 million yuan. Not much happened in Zhuzuo, and the price of 120-count bright rayon was slightly better. Xuzi Zuo priced at 3.18 million yuan, and Gaoshan brand was priced at 1.67 million yuan, a big increase of 560,000 yuan compared to before the closure. Other semi-gloss goods did not do much, and the quotes were firm. The silk market was quite quiet, and the factory disks mostly maintained the original price. Huazhong Crepe was still priced between 3.45 million and 500 yuan yesterday.

### Vermicelli Rebounds

Vermicelli, which was previously slack due to low sales, rebounded slightly. The local annual goods turnover has increased, and the price has recovered. Yesterday, high-quality vermicelli was priced at 230,000 yuan higher, reaching 3560,000 yuan.

### Rice Market Rises Sharply Indica Rice Rarely Seen on Formal Market Mixed Beans and Soybean Cake Rise and Fall Unevenly

Yesterday was the new year's red market trading in the rice market. The total volume in the northern and southern markets was about 9,000 stones. Because the stores closed for three days at the beginning of the year, the stores were more eager to enter the market, and the weather was cloudy and rainy. The northern and southern japonica rice rose by 230,000 yuan uniformly. Baiyuan was in the period of Xiao Ling, and the turnover turned smoothly, and it rose by 230,000 yuan. Yinyuan was profitable, and it also rose by 340,000 yuan. Indica rice was scarce and still rarely seen on the formal market. Soybeans also rose by 120,000 yuan due to the strong absorption of this street. Mung beans were weak in both arrival and sales, and there was not much honor or disgrace. Red beans were firm, corn was the opposite of supply and demand, and it was unwilling to open. The ground was quite solid. Sesame was strongly taken by Guangbang, and it continued to rise by 340,000 yuan. Raw peanuts were also bought happily by Guangfang, and continued to rise by 560,000 yuan. Soybean cakes were traded in Shantou, Xiamen, Jianzhou, and Taiwan. Mainland and Shenfang oil factories all had supply sources. The situation was prosperous in both arrival and sales. Oil prices rose and fell unevenly. There were many green island imports of raw oil, and the raw oil fell back by 230,000 yuan. Soybean oil was firm at first and then tired. The result was similar to the previous year's closing price. Clear oil also had no rise or fall. Only sesame oil rose by 350,000 yuan due to scarce goods and active sales. Flour rose by 220,000 yuan due to the unresolved factory strike and temporary suspension of work. Imports were scarce and the stores were very greedy. Bran rose by 1200 yuan.

### Silk Weaving Industry Joint Venture Company Funds Raised 400 Million Working Loans Approved 4.5 Billion

The deadline for raising funds for the silk weaving industry production and sales joint venture company is the day after tomorrow. The funds raised have exceeded 400 million yuan, which is very close to the original target. It is heard that almost all silk weaving and silk weaving factories in this city have participated. The company will convene representatives of participating manufacturers in the shortest possible time to listen to suggestions in order to develop business. It is also heard that the industry's original request for a working loan of 1.5 trillion yuan has now been approved by the China Communications Bank for 450 billion yuan, and the remaining amount can also be loaned out in the shortest possible time.

### Many Hua Stock Swap Transactions; Commercial Press Listing Immediately Hits Limit Down

Hua stock debuted yesterday, but trading was not seen to develop, and the market situation was bleak. Many who followed the gold market in speculation were too crowded. A large yarn and cloth group suddenly closed out a portion, and near noon it suddenly plummeted drastically. The future is not promising. The swap discount started with someone bidding at thirty yuan, and gradually decreased to around twenty-two yuan. The daily interest was less than 1.5 cents. The financial sector, such as Xingye, Xinhua, and Tongshang, all participated in the bidding. Yarn and cloth securities bulls, as well as Shengda, all swapped around twenty-seven yuan. Therefore, the situation was very calm. The morning opening was high due to the gold market looking good. After the opening, there were profit-takers emerging. No. 177 sold spot Yong yarn, and Nos. 198, 76, 47, and 152 sold forward Yong yarn. The market dropped to 617 yuan for spot transactions and 643 yuan for forward transactions. After 10:00 AM, the gold market stabilized again. Nos. 145 and 232 bid for spot Yong yarn, and the price once rose by more than ten yuan. Liann Department Store was listed at the upper limit by No. 31, but because Guangbang's No. 155 vigorously sold spot Yong yarn, the upward momentum was repeatedly blocked. Nos. 152, 212, and 47 all sold off, and the price remained depressed. Commercial Press was sold by No. 160 to the lower limit. However, midway through, due to the strength of gold and cloth, many retail investors maintained their positions. After 11:30 AM, Nos. 16, 137, 212, and 47 all sold spot Yong yarn, and Nos. 212 and 47 also sold forward Yong yarn. Near noon, speculative longs frantically cut their positions, and the market closed at a low price. As a result, compared to before the opening, Yong yarn and Xinhe each fell by 3-4%, Jingfu and Qinxing fell slightly, Huafeng was flat, and Xinguang and Meiya each fell by slightly less than 10%. Cold stock matches rose slightly, and the rest were relatively stable. Forward Yong yarn and Huafeng fell slightly, Xinhe fell by slightly less than 5%, and Xinguang fell by slightly less than 10%. Outside the market, various stocks in Zhabei rose slightly, Nanyang fell slightly, and the rest were flat.

The assistance of the gold market to foreign stocks yesterday was only able to show a little bit of shine. After Yi yarn traded at 7150 yuan, new buyers were on the sidelines. Except for Jardine Matheson and Wheelock & Co. (copper) rising slightly, the rest declined a little.

### Soap and Candle Factories Endangered Under Pressure from Foreign Goods

The local soap and candle industry suffered a slump last year due to massive imports and dumping of foreign goods. Currently, out of more than 50 companies, half have already been shut down. According to Liang Songling, chairman of the industry association, the soap production volume is: (1) 1.5 million boxes of laundry soap, 46 pounds per box, totaling 6.9 million pounds; (2) 300,000 boxes of toilet soap, 30 pounds per box, totaling 900,000 pounds. The raw materials required are 80% tallow, 20% coconut oil, 18% caustic soda, 5% salt, and 48,750 dan of fuel. To increase production, government assistance is needed to supply raw materials, especially caustic soda. In addition, a large amount of funding is needed, and the collection of business tax should be improved so that the tax is based on the capital amount, not the turnover. The raw materials for candle production are also in great need. If imports of foreign candles can be restricted, then domestic candle production will have a chance to survive.

### Zhongfang Rayon Price 30% Lower Than Market Price

After the New Year holiday, China Textile Construction Corporation announced the listed prices of rayon yesterday morning, which were 30% lower than the market price. The prices are as follows: (1) Plain cocoon, 28 inches, white, 2,700 yuan per yard; (2) Spun silk, 36 inches, white, 4,500 yuan per yard; (3) Cotton fabric, 29 inches, beige, 2,800 yuan per yard.

### Woolen Fabrics Arrive in Abundance, Transactions Abnormally Quiet

Recently, the sales of woolen fabrics and melton have been sluggish due to seasonal factors and various environmental conditions. The demand from customers on Tai Street is quiet, and retail and wholesale transactions are weak. The goods ordered from abroad previously have now arrived one after another. The influx is the largest seen in a year. However, the issuance of permits is quite slow, and trading companies are not optimistic. Currently, there are very few new orders from abroad, so the Shanghai market price, except for heavy goods, has gradually increased for light goods.

### China-Siam Shipping Route Successfully Opened; "Hai Lie" Ship Carries 3,000 Tons

According to news from the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company yesterday: The "Hai Lie" ship, which sailed on its maiden voyage on the China-Far East route in mid-December, has completed its glorious mission. The voyage lasted 18 days. The ship has already loaded 3,000 tons of Siamese rice in Bangkok for shipment to Shanghai. This batch of rice is part of the 30,000 tons of foreign rice ordered by our country from Siam. Therefore, the source of foreign rice will be more abundant in the future. The food supply in our city is not expected to be lacking. Before the War of Resistance Against Japan, our country's ships only sailed on the North and South Ocean and Yangtze River routes and were often squeezed out by foreign companies. After the victory, in addition to the China-Philippines route between Shanghai and Manila, which is already served by the "Hai Xia" ship, the opening of the route between our country and Siam has also been successfully completed, which is a pioneering achievement in the history of our shipping industry.

### New York Silver Price Falls

[Reuters, New York, 1st] Approximately 150,000 ounces of silver were sold in New York today at 83 cents (US) per ounce, reflecting sellers' efforts to sell off year-end inventory amid calm demand. Consumer factories are not expected to resume work until after January 6.

Another report: Handy & Harman, a gold and silver broker, today reduced its New York silver price by one cent (US) to 82 and 3/4 cents per ounce.

Another report: Amid recent silver price declines, daily sales of silver in New York have averaged around 100,000 ounces, while the amount offered for sale has been around 200,000 ounces per day. Buyers have shown no further interest in purchasing the large quantities of foreign silver recently shipped to New York from China, India, the United Kingdom, and the Near East. Most of this silver is forward-dated and needs to be refined, so there is clearly no demand. A U.S. silver consumer sought to purchase a considerable quantity of refined foreign silver from the Near East but has not received a response. Six million ounces of Spanish silver coins are being prepared for refining. It is suspected that around three million ounces of Spanish silver coins have already been shipped to the United Kingdom for refining. It has been announced that these downward trends only occurred when silversmiths stopped purchasing. At that time, they had already produced goods for the Christmas market, cleared factories, reduced product types, and sold large amounts of scrap silver. However, the trade hopes that consumers can quickly resume their normal daily purchases.

### Central Cooperative Treasury; Shanghai Branch Opens Tomorrow; Multiple National Branches Already Established

The Central Cooperative Treasury was established in Chongqing in the autumn of the 29th year of the Republic (1940) by the government to assist in rural economic construction. At that time, due to the wartime situation, all business could not be promoted smoothly. Last year, after approval by the Ministry of Finance, an additional 10 billion yuan of funds were allocated. It officially started business in Beijing on November 1, and promoted work. At the same time, branches were set up in various places. Branches have been established in the Northeast, as well as three sub-branches in Changchun, Jinzhou, and Shenyang. Four sub-branches have also been established in the pacification zone, such as Xuzhou, Huaiyin, Taixing, and Bengbu. Branches are still being planned in Henan and its sub-branch in Kaifeng, Shandong, Rehe and its two sub-branches in Chifeng and Chengde, Chahar and its sub-branch in Zhangjiakou. It is planned to set up branches in Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Hunan, Guangzhou, and Chongqing this year. It is learned that the Shanghai branch of the Treasury has been prepared and will open on the 6th of this month. Gu Zhuqi and Ma Ran will serve as the general manager and deputy manager, respectively. It is heard that its main business at present is to assist in the establishment of county cooperative treasuries and to provide loans for cooperative businesses.

### Japanese Cocoons Continue to Be Shipped to China; Still Hoping for Successful Negotiations

According to Ge Jingzhong, general manager of China Silk Corporation, regarding the news from General MacArthur's headquarters in Tokyo that the shipment of Japanese dried cocoons to China can continue to be negotiated, the company has not yet heard anything. However, at present, silk reeling factories in various parts of our country have stopped work due to insufficient raw materials. Even if the negotiations for this batch of Japanese cocoons are successful and they are shipped to our country, it will take at least two months, that is, after the Spring Festival. At that time, our country's domestically produced dried cocoons will also be supplied, so there is not much need for them. However, if they are cheap and of good quality, and they are verified by our country, we still welcome their shipment and sale to our country.

### United Credit Bureau Relocates

The United Credit Bureau, originally located at 6th Floor, No. 74, Dianchi Road, has moved in its entirety to 9th Floor, Zhongxing Daqing Building, No. 23, East Zhongzheng Road, and No. 303, Henan Road, starting from New Year's Day of the 36th year of the Republic (1947), due to business expansion and the original address being insufficient for office space. The internal organization of the bureau includes the following groups under the deputy manager: investigation, news, English, and general affairs, as well as a printing department. Currently, the manager's office, the investigation and general affairs groups, and the data room are located at the new address on East Zhongzheng Road. The news and English groups are located at the new address on Henan Road. The printing department is located in Huishanli, Tilanqiao.

### Guoxin Bank Expands Business; Adds Commercial and Trust Departments

### Private Elementary Schools in the City Hold Separate Meetings to Discuss Teacher Salary Issues; Private Elementary School Teacher Monthly Salary Set at 500,000 Yuan for Next Semester

The Private Elementary School Teachers Association of this city held a representative meeting at the New Life Club on Weihaiwei Road yesterday morning. More than a hundred representatives from various schools attended. Chaired by Wang Weiqun, it was resolved that the monthly salary for teachers in the next semester would be 500,000 yuan. At noon, Speaker Pan, Director Fang, Deputy Director Gu, and Deputy Director Li, as well as Councilors Zhou Feicheng and Chen Baotai, were invited to a banquet to preside over the meeting. Director Fang first expressed sympathy. Director Gu and Deputy Director Li also said that teacher salaries should be increased.

Speaker Pan Expresses that Private Schools Must Charge Fees

Speaker Pan stated that the educational expenses of the national schools in this city are fully borne by the government, which requires 80 billion yuan per year. The municipal budget proposed by the municipal government for this year is 230 billion yuan. If 35% is allocated to educational expenses as stipulated by the Constitution, it may be sustainable. However, the city is currently unable to bear this huge amount of taxes, so private schools must charge tuition to maintain the livelihoods of teachers. Finally, Jiang Jizhou stated that the lives of private school teachers have been more stable this semester, and their work efficiency and interest have improved significantly. The treatment of 500,000 yuan for the next semester is quite fair. However, the treatment of municipal school teachers in the next semester is only 340,000 yuan. It is hoped that the Municipal Council and the Municipal Government will plan a welfare fund of 160,000 yuan per month for each municipal school teacher, so that the lives of municipal school teachers can also be stabilized. It is also heard that the Private Primary and Secondary School Joint Association has set the amount of tuition for the next semester based on this standard.

City Middle School Friendship Association Discusses General Leave

Whether to implement or cancel the case of general leave starting from January 6 decided by the previous meeting will also be decided at the representative meeting this afternoon. In addition, five standing directors of the association, Xi Zhen, Zhang Zhihua, Li Xianzhang, Zhu Lie, and Gu Risan, will accompany representatives of municipal middle school principals to appeal to Speaker Pan of the Municipal Council at 10:00 AM this morning (5th), hoping for a reasonable adjustment of the treatment of municipal middle school teachers to stabilize the lives of teachers and support secondary education.

### Minister Zhu Jiahua Reportedly to Inspect Guangdong

### National Teachers College Establishes Education Research Office; Exchanges Research with American University

[This newspaper, Nanyue] The National Teachers College in Nanyue, Hunan, has established an Education Research Office to promote international cultural cooperation and exchange educational research materials.

### Key Battle in the Second Round of Group A; Donghua and Qingbai Meet Again; Listen to the Radio to Find Out if It Will Be Held Due to Rain

The original four matches in the football league yesterday, including Longjie vs. Youyou in Group A, were all postponed due to bad weather and rain all day. There will be another five matches in the league and the Youth Cup today. However, the match between Railway and Soviet B has been postponed due to water accumulation at the Jinyuan Park venue. Only nine matches remain. If the weather is rainy, the audience can listen to the Qingnian Cultural Radio Station (frequency 1220 meters) or the Shanghai Radio Station (frequency 900 meters) at noon, or call Yiyuan, Zhengzheng Park, and the Football Committee for inquiries.

One match in the second round of Group A today, the two Chinese giants Donghua and Qingbai will meet again at Yiyuan at 2:30 PM. The referee is Wu Shouheng, the linesmen are Chen Jixiang and Huang Renyi, and tickets are sold for 2,000 and 5,000 yuan at the Municipal Stadium.

Donghua has won all five matches since its debut, leading the pack, and has a high hope of winning the championship. Qingbai lost to Donghua in the first round and drew twice with Youyou, dimming its championship prospects. However, for the sake of revenge, it will do its best, so this battle is still a wonderful one.

Donghua has a Neat Combination

The Donghua lineup with a neat combination was announced by captain Jia Youliang yesterday. Zhuang Youren has returned to Shanghai and decided to play as a defender. The rest is the same as the previous week against the Jews. Bang Lun is the goalkeeper, Lin Gen assists A Zhuang as the center back, Fu Zhen, Long Bo, and Qia Xing are the forwards, A Dai is still the lead, Jin Shun and Li Yao are on the left, and Long Hai and Youliang are on the right. With a neat combination, they should be able to win again.

Qingbai has a Incomplete Lineup

Because Qu Yongfu and Luo Shoufu are in Hong Kong, and Fei Chunhua is injured, the Qingbai lineup will still use Tong Bei, Huang Zhendong, Zhang Renyi, and Jiang Guanqing to fill the lineup. However, the defenders have a pair of iron gates, Yan Shixin and Wu Qixiang, and the forwards have three musketeers, Li Yichen, Song Lingsheng, and Gu Yisa, so the combat effectiveness is still considerable. The schedule for today is recorded below:

Donghua - Qingbai (Group A) 2:30 PM Yiyuan

Maoxiong - Shenxin (Group C3) 9:00 AM Middle One

Youth Grade - Telephone (Group C5) 9:00 AM Middle Two

### A Splendid Scene in College Basketball: Datong Dramatically Defeats Jiaotong; in the College Group, Fazheng Defeats Tongde

[Our Own Report] The college basketball league matches started at 3:00 PM yesterday at the city gymnasium. Originally, there were three matches scheduled: Fazheng vs. Tongde in the college group, Tizhuan vs. Jiaoda in the women's group, and Jiaoda vs. Datong in the "Xue" (student) group. However, the Jiaoda women's team was absent on short notice, which was ruled as a forfeit. Instead, a friendly match was held between the Women's Youth team and Tizhuan. Despite the rain yesterday, over 2,000 spectators were present. The final match between Jiaoda and Datong was extremely exciting. The audience cheered and rooted for their teams, creating a lively atmosphere, which was an unprecedented spectacle in the college basketball league.

Fazheng Defeats Tongde

In the first match, Fazheng faced Tongde in the college group. The referees were Li Zhengzhong and Zhu Mingxing. After the whistle blew, both sides adopted strict formations. For six minutes, the scoreboard remained at zero. Tongde's center Dai Jin seized an opportunity to jump up and score a basket, creating the first record. Fazheng's forward Zha Jingshan was not to be outdone and scored a basket as well. The first quarter ended with Fazheng trailing Tongde by one point at 5-4. At the beginning of the second quarter, the difference between the two sides remained minimal. After tying at 7-7, Tongde briefly took the lead at 11-10. Later, Fazheng's Xiang Ting and Sun Zhenlin each scored with long-range shots, allowing them to take the lead at 14-11 by the end of the first half. After switching sides, Fazheng's offense intensified. Tongde only managed to score two points, while Fazheng increased their score to 33. In the final quarter, Tongde's Zhuang Ren'an repeatedly scored with long-range shots, but the overall situation was already beyond recovery. In the end, Fazheng defeated Tongde with a score of 44-33.

Women's Performance

In the second match, the women's group game, Jiaoda forfeited. The Women's Youth basketball team played a friendly match against Tizhuan. The Women's Youth team was petite and delicate, while Tizhuan was strong and powerful. In the end, Tizhuan narrowly defeated the Women's Youth team with a score of 20-14.

Datong Leads All the Way: In the final match, Jiaoda faced Datong. The Jiaoda team has made significant progress under the guidance of national team player Li Zhengzhong. Unfortunately, they did not use man-to-man defense at the beginning and their offense was slow, which allowed Datong to capitalize on several opportunities. Datong's Wang Bowen scored the first point, followed by Lin Weicong and Xu Zhongyi, who successively broke through the basket. Jiaoda's Shen Beijun and Ni Ziqi tried hard to catch up. At the end of the first quarter, Datong was leading with a score of 20-12. In the second quarter, Jiaoda played more calmly, but Datong's Xu Zhongyi was tall and had long arms, and Lin Weicong ran all over the court. At the end of the first half, Jiaoda was still behind with a score of 18-26.

Jiaotong Fights Hard but Suffers Defeat

After switching sides and resuming play, Jiaoda changed its strategy and managed to tie the score at 31-31. Datong's main player Xu Zhongyi committed his fifth foul and had to leave the court. The quick-footed Lin Weicong seemed to have little support, but Datong was still leading with a score of 40-35 at the end of the third quarter. In the final quarter, Jiaoda's Shen Beizhang scored continuously. Datong's Lin Weicong also fouled out of the game. Jiaoda was only one point behind Datong. Seeing the end of the match approaching, Jiaoda launched a fierce attack. Datong's defense was under immense pressure. Datong's Wang Bowen made a three-point shot before the end of the match, securing the victory. When time ran out, Jiaoda lost to Datong by one point with a score of 49-47.

### The Bright Side of Military Reorganization and Nation Building: From Consumption to Production, Turning Destruction into Construction

— Special Correspondent for This Newspaper, Fang Canglang

It has been over a year since China's victory, but due to ongoing internal conflicts, disrupted transportation, semi-abandoned agriculture, and declining industry, at least 200 million people in the country are still struggling on the brink of starvation. This situation is indeed distressing and disappointing. In this time of economic hardship, concerned individuals are deeply worried about the crises in finance, banking, industry, and commerce. They hope that the internal conflicts can be resolved as soon as possible, transportation can be restored quickly, and all the destroyed industrial and mining enterprises can be rapidly rebuilt, so that the government's plan for military reorganization and troop reduction can proceed smoothly. The vast and astonishing amount of military spending can be saved and diverted to reviving rural areas, helping industry and commerce, and promoting general education and cultural undertakings, in order to alleviate the current pressing economic crisis. At the same time, it should also give some respite to the people who are groaning, trembling, and fearing the harsh policies of conscription and grain requisition. This is not a luxury; it is indeed the insightful view of concerned patriots. If our military reorganization and troop reduction, our plan to turn destruction into construction and change consumption into production, cannot be carried out in today's bankrupt rural areas and struggling industries and businesses, and we continue to support more than 200 divisions of troops (according to recent reports, the current troop strength of the KMT and the Communist Party), the future of China's economy is truly unimaginable. Fortunately, amidst the disappointment, we can still see a glimmer of hope for the future of nation-building in the government's implementation of the military reorganization plan. This is what we have seen and heard from autumn to winter this year: the various expressions of more than 10,000 demobilized officers of the Sixth Army Officer General Headquarters in Nanchang during their training period before transferring to civilian life. If the achievements of this demobilized officer retraining can become a trend and be widely seen in every corner of China, we firmly believe that not only will all the military post-war problems arising from military reorganization and troop reduction not be a problem, but also those unruly behaviors such as disliking people, not listening to ears, hitting theaters, rushing to brothels, and destroying stations may gradually decrease and eventually disappear.

### Officers Changing Careers, Rising Rapidly

Last October, when the victory had just been won and the sound of cannons had just stopped, people who were keen on internal warfare were taking the opportunity to expand their armies, seize roads, destroy mines, compete for surrender, and grab land. The wise Chairman Chiang finally began to implement his plan for military reorganization and nation-building, regardless of everything else. The senior generals who assisted in planning this military reorganization plan at that time were Generals He Jingzhi, Bai Jiansheng, and Chen Cixiu. During this period, the General Headquarters of the Sixth Army Officer General Headquarters, in an unprecedented scale, was born in Qingyunpu, the only scenic area in the suburbs of Nanchang. The construction began in mid-October. The initial name was the Ninth War Zone Officer General Headquarters, and it began to recruit over 2,000 demobilized officers. On January 9th of this year, the war zone was abolished and it was transferred to the Ministry of Military Administration, and it was named as it is today. At that time, the first batch of demobilized officers from various army divisions and unemployed officers in the Jiangxi area totaled more than 3,900 people. By mid-April, the former General Commander of the General Headquarters was ordered to return to work at the Military Commission, and then Chen Pei, a lieutenant general who was both academically excellent and had made great achievements in the Anti-Japanese War in the Xiangbei Battle, was appointed as the General Commander of the General Headquarters. Chen had graduated from the military academy and the Army University. In the early days of the Anti-Japanese War, he was known to Generals Chen Cixiu and Xue Bailing for his role in defending Jinji Ridge to the death. General Commander Chen's strengths are perseverance, calmness, the ability to share the joys and sorrows of officers and soldiers, and a lack of desire for fame and wealth. He is an excellent military education talent, so he was able to gain the trust of his superiors and the love of his students.

### Second Lieutenants and Lieutenant Generals, Up to 12,000

After Chen took over as the head of the Sixth Army Officer General Headquarters, he soon received the Twenty-seventh Army Officer General Headquarters and recruited more than 5,000 unemployed officers with military school qualifications for the second time. By the end of July, the Sixth Army Officer General Headquarters had recruited as many as 12,000 officers who were preparing to transfer to civilian life, making it the largest officer general headquarters in the country and gradually becoming the largest military education group in the country with the most students and the most diverse subjects. The officers who were receiving transfer training in this large group ranged in rank from second lieutenants to lieutenant generals. Most of them were generals who had fought hundreds of battles in the Third and Ninth War Zones, and even platoon leaders, company commanders, and battalion and regimental commanders who had always been in the vanguard.

### Army Commanders and Platoon Leaders Relive School Life

They never dreamed that after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, they would be "demobilized" immediately and quickly assigned to the Officer General Headquarters. Whether they had been army commanders, division commanders, or even company or platoon leaders, they were treated equally, reliving the most disciplined school life and receiving basic training in nation-building such as police administration, transportation, industry and mining, agricultural reclamation, land surveying, local administration, health, labor, civil training, and education. As of early September, the General Headquarters had selected more than 2,100 officers to receive the above-mentioned vocational training at the Jiangxi Provincial Training Corps. Over 80 generals were sent to the General Officers Class of the Central Training Corps for training. Over 500 officers were trained in land surveying, finance, banking, and at police academies. In addition, over 500 people who had participated in civil service work in the army during the Anti-Japanese War have resigned as ordered. Many of them are college and high school students with excellent character and scholarship. Some of the outstanding officers who remain in the team have been selected to serve in various army divisions. Currently, over 6,000 officers remain in the team. Among them, 1,500 are processing their first retirement, and the rest are strengthening their transfer preparations. It is expected that by the end of this year, they will be able to take up new positions and engage in nation-building work in various departments to achieve the goal of demobilization.

### Chairman Visits the School and Praises the Achievements of the General Headquarters

Since Chairman Chiang personally visited Nanchang in early autumn to inspect all the officers receiving training at the General Headquarters, and publicly praised the great achievements and excellent military discipline of the General Headquarters at the Nanchang各界 (all circles) Welcome Chairman General Assembly, based on reports from all walks of life in Jiangxi and the speakers and vice speakers of the Provincial Senate, the reputation of the Sixth Army Officer General Headquarters has spread throughout the country, and intellectuals who are concerned about the important issue of China's reconstruction also believe that the government's military post-war measures have achieved considerable success. However, the fact that 12,000 officers were concentrated near Qingyunpu in Nanchang in the past, within a radius of 30 li, and the General Headquarters was able to complete such a complex and difficult officer retraining work in a short period of time with simple equipment, truly shows the hard work and effort of General Commander Chen, Deputy General Commanders Zhang, Deputy General Commander Li, and hundreds of generals and school instructors. The key to its success lies in the thoroughness of spiritual education and the proper application of the work system. According to some of the officers who received training, they came to the team with a lot of complaints and reluctance. Everyone inevitably felt a little uncomfortable. Later, they were moved by General Commander Chen's example of setting a good example in everything and publicly disclosing finances first, and they also admired his personality. In addition, the General Headquarters had long developed a spirit of self-awareness, autonomy, and self-government. Everyone knew to be ashamed and study hard, and to do their best in the face of difficulties. Therefore, even on holidays, most of the students stayed in the team to study and raise funds themselves, and rarely went out for entertainment. Therefore, in any public entertainment venues in Nanchang, there were few cases of students making trouble or fighting. The fact that soldiers in a provincial capital with a large population did not occupy civilian houses, watch free shows by force, or commit incidents such as beating up innocent civilians and disrupting military discipline is rare and valuable today.

### A Good Story in the Military: Five Generations Under One Roof

In addition, some interesting anecdotes about the officers of this Officer General Headquarters during their training are also worth reporting to readers. In class, they sometimes discovered good stories of four or five generations under one roof. Many platoon leaders discovered that their past battalion commanders, regimental commanders, division commanders, and even army commanders were receiving training with them, which made them feel very interested and unusually close. This kind of collective training method is indeed unprecedented in ancient and modern times, both at home and abroad. Therefore, such a complaining group finally merged into a great and lofty nation-building cause, regardless of age or rank, and naturally and happily forged some new talents for nation-building, each according to his own preferences and needs. Although at that time, it was necessary to select a group of suitable trainees to go to Northeast China or Shandong and other places in order to maintain local order and protect the interests of the people, and to relive military life, which occasionally caused them to ask a little doubt: "Eh, you said we were building the country, why are you just calling a few of us to lead troops to fight?" However, after General Chen Pei, who was sincere, straightforward, and gentle, explained this way: "For example, to lay the foundation for building a house, you must first clean up the garbage. Looking at road construction, you must also level the dirt. Now, when we are building the country, treacherous and deceitful people are deliberately creating obstacles and causing hardship to the people. If we don't remove these obstacles, not only will the achievements of the eight-year Anti-Japanese War be wasted, but the country will not be a country in the future!" Before the speaker finished speaking, the listeners also expressed their eagerness and begged with clenched teeth: "Since we have dedicated ourselves to the country, we will do whatever is needed. We are willing to be policemen, and it is also a great thing to change careers to transportation. It is a man's joy to open up a new world from industry, mining, agriculture, and reclamation. If we are transferred to local administration and given the work of township chiefs to be at the forefront of the people, this is also something we should do. We are not afraid of death, and even if we carry soil and stones, we will be happy to do so. Now, if the future of nation-building is full of obstacles, we dare not refuse to go to the Northeast, which is below freezing in the dead of winter!" How heroic are the soldiers, donning and doffing their armor, living and dying according to the country's commands. The achievements of education are like this, and it does not betray Chairman's hard work and concern for the country's talent reserves!

### Self-Improvement and Striving for Revival

— Cai Wenzhi

Time flies, and the New Year is upon us again. This time last year, the whole country was celebrating the New Year in a frenzy of victory, thinking that after eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, we had finally won and could strive for strength and construction, and place the country among the ranks of the great powers. Who knew that some people would seize military power and create internal strife, so that even though it has been more than a year since the victory, the people have not enjoyed the fruits of victory at all. Domestic rebellion has become increasingly serious, and most of our compatriots are still in deep water and fire, and their suffering has not been relieved. This is the reality before our eyes.

Current Objectives

As we celebrate the New Year amidst this turbulent domestic and international situation, our hearts are filled with heavy emotions. However, the revolutionary cause cannot be achieved overnight. The closer the revolution is to success, the more stubborn the forces hindering the revolution will be, trying to put up a last-ditch struggle. As long as we can strengthen our faith, march in step, and use the spirit of a strong man cutting off his wrist to eliminate the forces of counter-revolution and pseudo-revolution, eradicate all feudal remnants, separatist warlords, corrupt officials, local bullies, and evil gentry, then the revolutionary cause will surely succeed, and the revolutionary future will be bright.

As the saying goes, "The plan for the year lies in the spring." This is true for individuals, and it is also true for the country. On this auspicious day, I would like to offer a few points as goals for our efforts this year, and I hope to encourage all our compatriots:

Complete Unification

First, if we want the great cause of nation-building to succeed smoothly, we must first complete the unification of the country. If the country is not unified, society cannot be stable, internal conflicts will inevitably be frequent, and there will be no way to start any construction work. The unification of the country must be based on the unification of military and political orders as a prerequisite. Within a country, there cannot be two opposing armies or local governments that form separatist regimes. If all parties have the sincerity to serve the country and the people, they should join the government organization and strive for political power through political means. If they seize power by force, it will not only increase the suffering of the people, but also lead to the demise of the country. In order to safeguard the survival of the country, we must firmly oppose any behavior that undermines unification, and we must not fall for their propaganda tricks or be deceived by their beautiful slogans.

Complete Constitutional Government

Second, the current international trend is democracy. The theory of democracy is government of the people, by the people, and for the people, and the purpose of the Three Principles of the People is to transform China into a country of the people, by the people, and for the people. If we want to save the people from their plight, the most urgent task is to thoroughly implement the Principle of Democracy and the Principle of People's Livelihood. The current important tasks of political construction under the Principle of Democracy are to complete constitutional government and realize political democratization. We must support the government in convening the National Assembly, promulgating the constitution, and expanding the government organization so that the people can participate in politics and lay the foundation for the long-term stability and peace of the country.

Promote Construction

Third, the purpose of human life is to improve life and satisfy the enjoyment of people's lives. To achieve this goal, we must move towards industrialization and machine production. The United States has only been established for 200 years, but because of its attention to industrial construction, it has become the richest and strongest country in the world. China is very rich in resources, but it does not know how to use them, resulting in national poverty and people's poverty. In the future, the economic construction of completing the Principle of People's Livelihood should focus on promoting industrial construction, developing machinery, and using machine production as the first priority.

Develop Science

Fourth, since this war ended with the use of atomic energy, we must be aware that we have entered a new era. China has fallen behind two eras, one is the machine age and the other is the atomic energy age. If we want to catch up with the United States and the Soviet Union, we must actively promote science. China has not always ignored science in the past, but because of a lack of firm belief and vigorous implementation, it has often been a case of one day's effort followed by ten days of neglect, so there has been little success. Japan's promotion of science did not start earlier than China, but because of its firm belief and universal education, the usefulness of science has been greatly seen. China's current industrial backwardness and weak national defense are due to the underdevelopment of science. In the future, regardless of how the country's fortunes change, we must promote science on a large scale and universally, enlighten it from daily life in society, so that everyone can investigate things and explore principles, and gradually move towards using things to improve people's lives, enrich the people, and strengthen the country. Only in this way can we catch up with today's era.

The General Headquarters is located in Qingyunpu, the old site of the Tang Dynasty Taiyi Temple, which is also the place where Bada Shanren lived in seclusion in the late Ming Dynasty. It is the number one Taoist temple in Nanchang. Chairman Chiang used to be stationed here when he was suppressing bandits and suppressing rebellion. (Sent by special correspondent Fang Canglang)

### Northeast Education

— From Shenyang Air Dispatch on the 28th of December. Special Correspondent for this Newspaper, Han Qingtao.

Merchant Marine Mongolian Banner School

The Ministry of Education's established rehabilitation plan includes setting up a "National Changbai Normal College" in Yongji. In August of the 35th year of the Republic, the Ministry appointed Fang Yongzheng as the director in charge of preparations. The original site of the puppet Manchukuo "Jilin Shida University" was allocated for the college. Enrollment is now complete, and procedures for students to commence their studies are being handled. Classes should begin soon.

The Ministry decided to establish a National Changchun University in Changchun. The Guidance Committee sent three members—Yang Zhihuan, Yao Pengling, and Gao Shijia—to Changchun in June to take over various puppet Manchukuo universities. They will utilize the complete school buildings as the preparation office for Changchun University and carry out preparatory work. In August, the Ministry of Education appointed Huang Rujin as the director in charge of preparations. Huang arrived in Changchun in late August and immediately began preparatory work, including hiring professors, repairing school buildings, and handling student admissions and examinations. Preparations are now largely complete, and the school will soon open.

The entire premises of the "Huludao Merchant Marine School" are currently occupied by the U.S. military and the UNRRA (United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration) office in Huludao. The U.S. military can only withdraw after completing its repatriation work, and the UNRRA work is expected to conclude by March of next year. Currently, the entire facility cannot be vacated. After repeated negotiations, UNRRA has released a portion of the buildings as dormitories for the personnel guarding the school. The entire facility will be taken over once the above two groups have vacated the premises. Furthermore, the school's original 132 students urgently need to be properly settled to avoid losing their chance at education. Considering that maritime talent is urgently needed by the country, the Ministry has approved the establishment of the "National Huludao Merchant Marine School" at the original site. The Ministry has appointed Wang Shize as the principal, and Principal Wang has already arrived in Panjin to discuss preparatory matters.

Mongolian Banner compatriots live in remote border areas and are often disconnected from central government policies. To improve their knowledge and consolidate the border defense, a request was submitted to the Ministry of Education to establish a Mongolian Banner Normal College. The Ministry ordered the temporary establishment of a "National Liaomeng Normal School" in Sipingjie or Changchun. Qi Binru has been appointed by the Ministry as the head of the school, with plans for a formal opening in the spring of next year, which will contribute to national reconstruction.

Andong Province has been recovered, and educational undertakings urgently need rehabilitation. Regarding higher education, the Guidance Committee previously requested and obtained approval from the Ministry of Education to establish a "National Andong Agricultural and Industrial College" in Andong, capable of accommodating 500 to 700 students. College takeover commissioner Liu Yuwu has been dispatched to Andong to handle the affairs of the unified takeover committee and the education group of the Andong branch, as well as to survey the site for the Agricultural and Industrial College. Furthermore, the Ministry has ordered Supervisor Sun Aitang to travel to Andong to inspect and prepare for the establishment of the college.

Students have been actively protecting the school, so the original equipment has largely remained undamaged. Based on the original scale, it has been renamed the "Ministry of Education, Shenyang Youth Re-enrollment and Employment Guidance Center Secondary School Preparatory Class" to accommodate the original students. Guo Xinqiu has been appointed as the director, responsible for reorganization.

### An American's View of China

— By Mr. Gold, Editor-in-Chief of the Shanghai English-language "China Press"

Any well-meaning American who looks at China has only one view, which must be based on close friendship and place high hopes on the future.

I say this not with flattery, as many such articles do, nor am I being sentimental. My belief is that the United States and China have always been very good friends, so we not only can but should be frank with each other.

Views on Chinese People - Daring Not to Be Arrogant

The beginning of this article is truthful, and it is pleasing that these words are pleasant. In fact, there are also many unpleasant truths that, if both sides could openly acknowledge, might further benefit both countries.

Although I am not writing this from the perspective of a Chinese person looking at America, it might not be without value if, at the outset, I could first consider what criticisms the Chinese might have of me and my fellow countrymen. I feel that we Americans seem more susceptible to criticism in psychological aspects than in material ones. We have repeatedly given China large amounts of materials and money, far more than we have received from China—whether as gifts or from what the Chinese often criticize as foreign economic aggression. We substantially helped China win the war of resistance against Japan, although many Chinese criticize us for helping too slowly. However, it may be unavoidable that our attitude is sometimes less than humble. We Americans, as guests in foreign lands, may not all be careful in our actions everywhere. Undoubtedly, our attitude is sometimes seen as arrogant, although we never intentionally mean to appear so; it is just how others perceive it. Our entire nation indeed has a tendency towards impatience and intolerance. If things do not start smoothly, we often become angry or frustrated, which may be very important now that China's post-war recovery is rather slow.

These words cannot include all the criticisms the Chinese have of Americans, but I hope I have at least shown that I have considered this aspect and that I do not view the Chinese with arrogance. I first arrived in what was then Beijing in 1924, and I have spent most of my time in China since then. After living here for so many years, I have had ample opportunity to see many things that should prompt criticism from myself and us Americans, while at the same time seeing that the Chinese are often content and satisfied. An average Chinese person enjoys much less than an average American, but is better at enjoying happiness.

Though Rich in Creativity, Poor at Managing Enterprises

If I were to say something about China from an American perspective, I could not help but admit that seeing the Chinese people's contentment sometimes makes me impatient. If the Chinese were more discontented, perhaps building a better China would be quicker. They accept things that could clearly be improved too easily. In my view, this is one of the things that urgently needs to change if China is to modernize.

Why are the Chinese so creative when inventing things but unable to promote those good enterprises? This is a question I have never been able to answer. Many good beginnings are to the credit of the Chinese, but they have not been able to sustain the original achievements. Take printing, for example. China was the first to know about printing, but this extremely important enterprise has not been made available to all the Chinese people, benefiting only a small number of highly educated individuals. Compared to other countries, the circulation of Chinese books, magazines, and newspapers still seems insufficient. We are told that many Chinese are too poor to afford books, which shows that printing has not been fully utilized. Printing is a tool for disseminating knowledge, and it will surely help China prosper in the future. China should have been able to do this centuries ago, but China has sat idly by, allowing this useful invention to become too specialized and eventually decline.

One of the Greatest Weaknesses - Inability to Employ Talent

China had an imperial examination system very early on, which was the earliest civil service system. However, this system also eventually declined and became useless. From an American perspective, one of the greatest weaknesses in China, whether in government or private enterprise, is the preference for relatives and friends and the inability to employ talent. Now they should return to the system that China itself once led.

China is mainly an agricultural country with the most farmers, and farmers are practical. The Chinese have historically been a practical people, which is why. However, I feel that in the current new environment, they seem somewhat less practical, especially in the industrial sector. Previously, Shanghai workers were often oppressed because many employers did not understand that if workers had shorter working hours, better meals, and higher wages, it would increase work efficiency, and the employers themselves would profit more. Now, we feel that there is an opposite trend. Workers often make demands on employers that the employers cannot realistically afford, and any explanation is disregarded as long as the workers believe it violates their interests. As a foreigner, I have heard that in some foreign-owned factories, workers demand extremely high wages from foreigners, saying that if the employers do not pay the wages, they should send some foreigners back. This is completely impractical; people come to foreign countries to do business, not to give money away. Missionaries come to do good deeds, which is different, and perhaps many Chinese people are somewhat confused. A better approach would be to compare foreign businessmen in China with Chinese businessmen abroad. Their main intention when going abroad is simply to do good business!

Which Path to Take - The Time for Choice is Now

Now, I want to mention a question that is of greatest concern to me right now. That is: is China preparing to take a strict nationalist path, or does it want to adopt a more internationally-oriented attitude? If the idea is "China for the Chinese," then it may be difficult to expect much help from other countries in the future. The United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) is about to end, and most of the countries that donated materials seem to have an unfavorable impression of the practical results. Among these countries, the United States is in a leading position. Many Americans and others feel that the best way to help countries like China in the future is to treat such help as a business, rather than continuing to simply give things away. So, China must now choose; it cannot adopt a nationalist stance while simultaneously wanting to receive the materials it needs for its recovery.

Establishing Fair Treaties - Mutual Benefit for Both Countries

If China still wants help from other countries, it is to be expected that these other countries will demand certain benefits. I am not saying that they necessarily want any privileges that would harm China's sovereignty. In fact, there are no signs of such developments. Many Chinese people's attitude toward the Sino-American Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation really surprised the Americans. This is a traditional and conservative treaty, intended to establish fair provisions to be followed in Sino-American trade, aiming for mutual benefit for both countries. Many Americans believe that China would initially benefit more from this, as the United States has abundant resources and suffered relatively less damage during the war. However, several Chinese newspapers expressed doubt, saying that the intention of signing this trade agreement was a form of American aggression against China. However, no one has ever explained how this aggression could succeed. The United States has been "giving" more than "taking" in these years, and many believe that if China is to stand firm, the United States still needs to donate a great deal of wealth. However, it is painful to see that some Chinese people still harbor such doubts, because this kind of mentality can prompt the United States or other countries to withdraw from China and find other uses for their wealth.

Maintaining Cordial Mutual Trust - Controlling Trade Trends

From the position of an American, I do not want others to think I am too sensitive, and I am not afraid of others putting America's commercial plans to the most detailed examination to see if they are good or bad. I only hope that the United States and China can maintain the cordial mutual trust of the past, because this kind of ordinary psychological issue may have a considerable impact on controlling future trade trends. I hope that China can not only show that it trusts the United States, but also that China can see that it really needs to offer special incentives to make American capital and technology willing to come to China. The current China is not a place that is pleasant to invest in. The opportunities to lose money are many, this is a clear fact. The Chinese themselves also understand this point, because when they do business themselves, when lending a somewhat risky loan, they usually ask for a large interest rate first. Similarly, if you call on foreigners to invest in China, foreigners will naturally expect to receive better profits than in places where investment is safer. However, we cannot find the incentives that would make Americans come to China to take this risk. Not only do they see that there is not much opportunity to make money, but in fact, China's current laws do not allow them to remit the money they earn back to the United States. They are subject to many Chinese government regulations, such as regarding obtaining foreign exchange, import rights, and many, many other items, and these regulations are increasing daily. So, in this situation, we hardly see any new American or other foreign companies willing to take risks in China. Some people are continuing to operate companies established before the war, but they find it very difficult to maintain.

Working Together - Hope for Revival

So, according to an American's view of China, I only feel quite lonely, except for the many personal friends I have known in these years. And these Chinese friends of mine are also suffering the same misfortune as American and other foreign companies. They often have to compete with government enterprises and are often constrained by various regulations. They are suffering from inflation. I sympathize with them very much, and I do not want to suggest any reforms that would put American interests in China above those of the Chinese. The current situation is a difficult moment for all of us. I only suggest that when dealing with China's various problems, the Chinese should, on the one hand, utilize the experience that foreigners already have, and combine this experience with all the good talents they possess. For example, we have discovered in America that too many regulations only hinder business. Recently, the United States was very short of meat, and someone suggested that President Truman control national ranches and confiscate privately owned livestock. He did not adopt this suggestion, but instead canceled all rationing limits. Of course, this had the adverse consequence of raising prices, but at least some meat appeared on the market, and the meat industry gradually flourished. I think the Chinese also respond better with less control. If someone can encourage Americans to come to China, and can make them feel welcome after they come to China, I think they can find many Chinese who are willing to work with them. As long as everyone can cooperate, China's commerce can be revived. Only after commerce can proceed quickly is there hope for restoring prosperity. The Chinese are the same as the Americans; only by restoring prosperity can they enjoy all the pleasures of life.

Movies and Drama Published Every Sunday

### Comedy Talk

— Guan Yu

Since the performance of "Promotion Chart," comedies have been continuously staged. It is said to be a transitional period for spoken drama, using comedies to maintain this crisis. However, the reason why "Promotion Chart" was able to sell out was not entirely because it was a comedy, but because its content was closely related to the audience's lives and spoke the words that the audience wanted to say, thus creating its unprecedented box office record.

Although the eight-year War of Resistance was victorious, flames of war are still everywhere; in people's minds, everyone has a shadow. Therefore, "laughter" has become a spiritual need. However, meaningless "laughter" cannot dispel the darkness in people's minds; only "laughter" that speaks out the worries and sorrows in people's hearts is what people need.

The currently playing "Wedding March" and "Nepotism" are two comedies.

"Wedding March"

This describes single women who have not married cannot find housing, and married women cannot find jobs. Although the author uses a tragedy in the last act to end the play, he did not depart from the theme of the play.

Huang Ying is a young girl who is new to the world and full of hope for her future. She has bright ideals and rich fantasies, but the real society gives her disappointment and setbacks everywhere. This is not Huang Ying's fault, but the strange phenomena in society that are preventing her, deceiving her, and not letting her take the path she hopes for.

Many intellectual housewives had great plans during their school days, but after marriage and having children, these plans are all in vain. They intuitively place the responsibility for destroying their plans on marriage. Since watching this "Wedding March," they will see that the responsibility lies not in marriage, but in "social problems."

"Nepotism"

The author uses a satirical pen to ruthlessly draw this ugly picture, telling countless unemployed intellectual youths the reasons for their unemployment. He writes about officials using the nepotistic relationships of their wives as stepping stones to promotion and wealth; he also writes about using nepotistic relationships as a means of seeking employment and promotion. It is because these shameless officials employ people based on nepotistic relationships that talented and specialized personnel are unable to realize their ambitions.

It also incidentally writes about the stupidity of officials: acting as soon as they have a concept. So many jokes come out of it.

The actors in this play all perform well, but the actress playing Chen Baiqi often cannot help but laugh, which greatly disrupts the mood of the play.

### On the Missteps of Tianchan

— Feng Chang

After Cheng and Tan's performances at the Tianchan Stage, Gao Shenglin took the lead, supported by Yuan Shihai and Yang Juping, and they have already taken the stage in recent days.

In fact, this decision-making plan is smart in its general outline. Mei Lanfang sells 20,000 at the "China" theater, Qilin Tong sells 12,000 at the "Golden" theater, and Gao Shenglin only sells 6,000—even more discounted than Qilin Tong. The Tianchan has many seats, so selling more at a lower profit can defeat Qilin Tong and not lose to Mei Lanfang.

However, they made missteps in the details, because they gave up Yan Shishan and replaced him with Yang Juping. Let's not talk about the benefits of Yan Shishan yet, and talk about the inappropriateness of Yang Juping.

First, Yang Juping lacks both the charm of a courtesan and the beauty. In terms of her appeal, she has long lost this point in Shanghai-style opera, let alone her Beijing-style opera? She can "Spin Cotton" and "Split the Coffin," but has never become "famous" for it. In terms of attracting audiences, she is even less capable. At the same time, she is Guo Yukun's wife. The "viewing" public is even less interested in her, unless Tianchan lets her dance a "Five Strips Dance" (one more strip than Wu Xiaolan) on stage every evening performance, perhaps she can still attract dozens of spectators. But this is absolutely impossible.

Second, regarding Yang Juping's singing, the fundamental skills and other descriptive terms of true Peking Opera art, I think it is best not to use them. The simplest sentence is that Yang Juping is in no way up to the current Tianchan lineup of Wei Lianfang on this point.

Third, perhaps one of the reasons Tianchan hired Yang Juping was to pair her with Gao Shenglin. What can she pair with him? The most common is nothing more than "Cui Ping Mountain" and "Wu Song and Pan Jinlian." Let me ask, in the case of these two plays, in today's Shanghai, does Gao Shenglin have a strong appeal when he sings? Or does Yang Juping have a strong appeal when she sings? Or do Gao and Yang together have a strong appeal when they sing? The answers to these three questions are naturally all "no." Just look at the opening night to know; Gao and Yang's "Wu Song and Pan Jinlian" can only be sung as the final play, and a "Chain Scheme" is added behind it. From this, we can know that "Wu Song and Pan Jinlian" is at most a "gift play" or "subsidiary play" in Gao Shenglin's appeal (I am not talking about his art here). Since this is the case, a play without appeal should save some money in terms of business, and also pay attention to matching in terms of art, so it is already sufficient to use Wei Lianfang, why bother hiring Yang Juping?

From the above three points, it seems that Yang Juping should not have been hired. Let's now talk about the benefits of Yan Shishan.

First, he has the best martial dan foundation (the number one martial role in both the north and south). In terms of art, he should be hired.

Second, he has an absolute appeal to the audience on the three floors and back rows of Tianchan. The Tianchan Stage has many and wide seats on the three floors and back rows. If Tianchan's prices are cheap, it also has a considerable appeal to the front-row audience. So, if Yan Shishan can be used well, there must be many people at the Tianchan gate buying tickets to see Yan Shishan.

Third, if his play is listed as the finale, he will definitely put in effort; the more effort he puts in, the more people will watch, regardless of whether they are in the front or back rows. Only when Gao and Yuan are on the same stage does he not have the opportunity to be listed as the finale. When other sheng and dan come, he is relegated to Ban Shichao's position, which loses the effectiveness of the land. So Yan Shishan should be used cleverly.

Also, when it comes to plays such as "Da Sizhou City" and "Yang Pai Feng," he also has a special appeal, and should be placed in the finale, with Gao Shenglin playing the monkey and Yang Liulang: it should be a smarter way for stars to support stars. Moreover, to make Yan Shishan more appealing, and to make Yan Shishan's plays sell more, only when Gao and Yuan cooperate, because Gao Shenglin is willing to play a supporting role today. In a few days, when he becomes popular, he may not be willing. All famous and unique works should use the method of listing them as the finale to promote him, so as to reveal the most artistic aspect of the play.

Previously, when Li Wanchun and Mao Shilai were on the same stage, this method was used. Li played Huangfu Gang in Mao Shilai's signature play "Da Ying Jielie," and only received unanimous praise; no one said that Li Wanchun had lowered his status.

Naturally, Gao Shenglin is also willing to play a supporting role, and should also play a supporting role, as long as Yan Shishan has true art.

### Finding Character Personas

— Gao Heng

Typical Creation: A "typical" character is one who, due to specific economic conditions, professional lives, etc., is grouped together with others in society. For example: groups of farmers, groups of workers, groups of merchants... Within each group, because of the similarities in their professions, lives, habits, etc., there are commonalities in their speech, actions, and even skin and clothing. These all represent the characteristics of their group, and these characteristics are the best material for authors. At this point, the embryo of creation is the "typical" character.

Individual Creation: In addition to the characteristics shared by each character with their own social class, their unique background, age, strengths, weaknesses, temperament, etc., produce their individual actions, language, and temperament. Therefore, besides creating typical characters within a group, an author must dig deep into the unique aspects of each character.

External Creation: Humanity has a vast variety of types: tall and short, fat and thin, kind and cruel, handsome and ugly... And in terms of manners and habits of action, each is unique. Robbers have the appearance of robbers, petty thieves have the behavior of petty thieves, hypocrites have the attitude of gentlemen, enchanting women have the allure of enchanting women, and gentle ladies have the tranquility of gentle ladies. Therefore, if you want to make your character leave a deep impression on the reader, you must also pay attention to the external creation of your character.

Internal Creation: It is not enough for an author to only focus on the external appearance of a character; they must go further and pay attention to the inner life of the character. A person's external behavior and speech must be rooted in their inner thoughts and emotions. The inner emotions of a melancholy woman and a joyful wealthy merchant are fundamentally different. Similarly, two farmers may both be thin, but their experiences are different, so their inner expressions will never be the same. A character with only external form is just a shell; only with an inner life does it have a soul.

### About Kunqu Opera

— Xiang Peiliang

(Editor's Note): This is a letter from Mr. Xiang Peiliang, discussing Mr. Xuanlu's article "Observations on the Rise and Fall of Kunqu Opera" published in this journal on December 15th of last year. The editor has published a section of the letter related to the article as an academic discussion.

Mr. Xuanlu's article "Observations on the Rise and Fall of Kunqu Opera" was partially deleted by the editor due to space constraints. For example, in point five raised by Mr. Xiang Peiliang, Mr. Xuanlu added an explanation in parentheses after "several acts," namely the words "several songs," which were deleted by the editor. We sincerely apologize! My knowledge of this field is quite lacking, but I can point out that Mr. Xuanlu's writing has errors in almost every section.

1.  There is a great distance between the Chu Ci (Songs of Chu) and the Han and Wei Yuefu (Music Bureau poetry). The so-called Chu songs are not included in the Chu Ci. Early Western Han Dynasty Yuefu, such as the Fangzhong Ge (Songs of the Chamber), suburban sacrifices, and Naoge (Military Songs), have no origin in four-character poems. How can one broadly say: "It repeatedly changed and became the Han and Wei Yuefu?"

2.  "Song Ci evolved into Yuan Qu (Yuan Dynasty Songs)" I don't know what the basis for this is. Qu such as Guzici, Zhuantata, and Liling existed as early as the early Northern Song Dynasty.

3.  There are many documents on the Canguan Huanghu Xi (Adjutant Huanghu Play), so how can one say: "What the content is like, there is no way to verify?"

4.  Qu includes Ju Qu (Dramatic Songs) and San Qu (Aria Songs). San Qu is not in the third-person form. The Yuan and Ming Dynasty authors were very prosperous, so how can one say: "Qu is in the third-person form, with lyrics and dialogue?" Lyrics are Qu, dialogue is not Qu.

5.  "Each play is divided into several acts" I don't know what kind of Chinese drama this is (except for spoken drama).

6.  "The Kunqu Opera that is now transmitted is no longer a return to Yuan Qu" I don't know what this is saying. The Kun character in Kunqu refers to a type of singing style, not a dramatic genre, so it cannot be compared with Yuan Qu at all.

7.  "Although the Ming people wanted to restore the ancient, they could not escape its clichés. Therefore, Qu has a distinction between North and South." I don't know that South Qu actually predates North Qu. Southern Song Yongjia Zaju, also known as Xiwens, developed before Yuan Qu; why did it only become "divided into North and South" in the Ming Dynasty? Even the Pipa Ji (Lute Song), which Mr. Xuanlu considers to be its pioneer, was written before the end of the Yuan Dynasty.

8.  "Zaju is called North Qu, and its system mostly imitates the works left by the Yuan people." I don't know what else "Yuan people's works" are called if not Zaju?

9.  "Chuanqi is called South Qu, and Gao Zecheng's Pipa Ji opened its pioneer, followed by Jing Liu Bai Sha in the early Ming Dynasty." These few sentences have made two major mistakes. There are many extant catalogs of South Qu (Xiwens). There are also three types of Southern Song works passed down, such as Xiaosun Tu. The four types of Jing Liu Bai Sha, except for Chugui Ji (Bai Yue Ting), were all before the Pipa Ji, that is, before the establishment of the Ming Dynasty.

Alright, I've already written nine points, no need to write any further, in our country, nine is considered the extreme number, so no need to write ten points; but what I've recorded is less than a third of the original text!

### A Protagonist of "Nepotism": Feng Zhe

### The Nature of Light

— Wenquan

More than two thousand years ago, Aristotle explained the nature of light, saying: a luminous body is the starting point of motion, and generates waves in the "medium" around it, gradually spreading farther and farther until it reaches the human eye. Newton initially did not believe this either. In 1678 AD, the Dutchman Huygens also reiterated this theory. Later, the Englishman Young and the Frenchman Fresnel elaborated in detail and explained all optical phenomena, and only then did the current conclusion arise.

The occurrence of light may be due to electricity or chemistry, but the most important and common reason is that the body heats up and everything rises together. Heat is essentially the rapid vibration of matter. This movement waves to the surrounding medium, forming radiating ripples. Like a stone thrown into water, ripples rise suddenly. The faster the movement, the higher the heat, the shorter the wavelength, and the human eye sees its light, from orange to yellow to pure white. Depending on the wavelength of that light, the color perception varies.

Usually, when light travels to the boundary surface of a second medium, it must reflect a part of it, which is the reflection of light. If the light-receiving surface is extremely smooth, like a mirror or water, the measured reflection is also very regular. That is, how large the angle of incidence is, how large the angle of reflection is. If the light-receiving surface is slightly uneven, the direction of reflection is not specified. Because of this irregular reflection, we can get so many conveniences in our lives. For example, even if no sunlight enters the room, it is reflected by the blue sky, and then reflected by the floating dust, and all object surfaces reflect in a complicated way, still maintaining an appropriate brightness, and all objects are not black shadows, but rely on this to fully reveal their shapes.

The larger the angle of incidence of the object surface reflection, the stronger the reflection amount. When light shines perpendicularly on the water surface, the reflected light is 18 per thousand; when it is 30 degrees, it is still only 19 per thousand; at 80 degrees, it reflects 333 per thousand, and at 90 degrees, it reflects 721 per thousand. When we are by the sea, we see the nearby area as blue, but the distance is blurred; also, the shadows of trees in the river are clear nearby but blurred in the distance. These all belong to the same principle.

When light rays pass through the second medium, their direction must be slightly refracted, which is the refraction of light. With this physics of refraction, we can use a prism to disperse white light and obtain a color band of red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and purple. Let us know that the above pigments are related to the three primary colors of red, green, and blue. The morning dew reflects the sun and emits strange colors, and the sky is blue after the rain, and there is also a rainbow. Even the spray and flowing waves become a mystery of different colors, which is broken through by this. It turns out that it is the action of water droplets in the air separating light.

In addition to the light separation effect, light can also be separated by microscopic particles and molecules in space, and transformed into various colored lights. For example, if you drop milk into water and mix it, it becomes turbid, and if you then shine light on it, you will see that the surface of the water is slightly bluish, and the bottom of the cup is slightly orange-yellow. This principle is that the longer red, orange, and yellow colors in the light wave do not conflict with the smaller particles, but pass by peacefully, while the shorter blue and purple are blocked and folded back. Also, if cooking smoke is set off by village houses and trees, it is dark and blue. If it is supported by outer space, it will be warm and yellow. This is also the light separation effect of carbon particles in the smoke. Similarly, when the night air is turbid, or there is fog, the light seen from a distance is red, gradually becomes orange as it gets closer, and becomes yellow as it gets closer. Therefore, it is difficult to see pure colors in distant scenes, and they are diluted by the microscopic particle separation. In American dance stages and color movies, microscopic particles are often sprayed under colored lights to exchange for the illusion of colored mist. And what can be found on our country's stage is only extremely unsanitary dust.

### Roosevelt

— Xinfang

Who Plays This Great Statesman?

The late American President Roosevelt dedicated his life to seeking world peace. His deeds will of course be immortal in world history. Hollywood companies in the United States had long had plans to put this world-renowned great man on the screen, but the reason why it has not been realized until now is, on the one hand, because it cannot be done hastily; on the other hand, it is because it is not easy to find a suitable and competent actor to play this "Roosevelt" on the screen. It is said that Lyon Barrymore was initially selected; but it was abandoned due to the resolute opposition of Mrs. Roosevelt. Her reason for disagreement was that when her husband ran for the last presidential election, Lyon Barrymore was on the side of the opposition party. The MGM company in Hollywood finally selected a British actor residing in New York to take on the role, Todfrey Tearle. Whether in appearance or posture, he looks very much like Roosevelt. According to public opinion from all walks of life, it is believed that he will definitely be able to satisfy the role. Mrs. Roosevelt also did not object; but she requested that the film company pay attention to not shooting the "Roosevelt" on the screen head-on, but shooting it at a three-quarter angle would be best. The company accepted her suggestion. Finally, this great biographical film is now named (The Begiming & the End). Although Mr. Roosevelt is dead, his spirit is immortal, and his career is worthy of admiration by future generations, so this naming is also very well chosen!

### New Film Ramblings

— Ma Boliang

"The Pirate"

Charles Laughton's More Than Ample Acting Skills

It was that string of the same shadows that enveloped him: cruel, vicious, mean, cunning, insidious, and hypocritical. This pirate leader is not much different from other pirate leaders. There is only one difference: he wants to be an aristocrat, a gentleman, and tries to get rid of his superficial rudeness everywhere, without the straightforward recklessness and uninhibitedness of Pan Zhuoweila in "Long Live Freedom." So he is not a hero, and a huge shadow sweeps across his life, and Captain Kidd is finished. This character is quite common, not as fleshy as Pan Zhuoweila. There is not a single spark of humanity here. If we list it as the best New Year's play, it is still because of the adventurous curiosity hidden in our childhood. The director followed the intention of the screenwriter, and did not use climaxes, but only introduced it in an orderly manner, scene by scene, which can be regarded as neat and tidy. The most striking thing is the black register, with names crossed out one after another. It is a pity that the director did not add a trick, let others add and then cross out Kidd's name, otherwise it would be even more powerful.

Kidd's personality is so special that Charles Laughton finds it really easy to play, but it is too easy, so there is no majestic and strange place in the depiction, it is just competent. Randolph Scott's Macy and Barbara Britton's Annie are purely supporting roles, embellishments. Randolph is still conservative and stereotyped, and Barbara is not as good as the refined nun in "Virginia." On the other hand, the other supporting actors are very good. Leitchino Owen's "gentleman's gentleman," the long-faced man playing the pirate leader Pffe, and the one playing the pirate leader Lorenzo, are all colorful.

Colorful Phoenix Sings

Joan Leslie, the Successor to Deanna Durbin

Girlish stars with a charming and coquettish style are still popular, but those who liked Deanna Durbin in junior high school are now beginning to prefer the new style of Joan Leslie. Deanna Durbin, Diana Barrymore, and Donna Reed, the sparks of Deanna Durbin are gradually extinguished, and we have now lost our past expectations for her and no longer dream of her fat face. "Where Do We Go from Here?" has a comedy style, and Deanna is still considerable, but in "Lady on a Train" and "Christmas Holiday" she has already become mediocre. The five colors of "Colorful Phoenix Sings" cannot save her either. Her face is not suitable for color, and it is more graceful and lovely in black and white films. Director Robert Lynen is just a junior after all, unable to use the camera, and the introduction of the story is extremely flat. The screenwriter's handling of the subject matter has only one unconventional point, that is, after taking a bath, he sings to the girl in the room next door, mistaking her for an old woman, and turning the story around a corner. Jerome Kern's composition is still pleasant to listen to, so Deanna sings on the carriage, light and free, the male lead Robert Benchley is mediocre, and this pair of treasures, Akim Tamiroff, although they are clowns, are not annoying.

I just like one scene of it, just like I love this musical film "Meet Me in St. Louis." That is when the flowers and trees are luxuriant, and the sun comes to play in the mountains and fields. Deanna, wearing a white shirt, is surprised by the beautiful natural scenery and can't help but sing out loud. When we arrive in a place with beautiful mountains and clear waters, we often have the feeling of singing freely, and Deanna's singing is exactly what we have in mind. Secondly, in a love song by the stream, there is indeed a light of love on Deanna's face. It is the only remaining bud of her past glory, and it is youth shining beautifully.

Double Phoenix Fate

The Screen Lacks Five Colors, and Marie Monteil Loses Color.

The black dance fan is half-covered, the black dance shirt flutters, and the black starry eyes are vaguely opened. Marie Monteil is a little alive, not an idol like a princess in a fairy tale world, but without five colors, Marie feels diminished. The too long face and unattractive new clothes, we regret Marie Monteil's stagnant eyes. Leaf Fengdai Carlo really won. "Double Phoenix Fate" is several times more dilapidated than "Salome," scattered and sparse. As a detective film, it is not tense, mysterious, has no atmosphere, and no climax. Only the scene where Louis Hayward forcibly drags the police sergeant down the elevator to perish together is more powerful. Compared to "The Bribe," "Double Phoenix Fate" is really bad. This cannot be blamed on Marie Monteil. The director, screenwriter, and producer cannot escape the blame. For example, the role of Sapo is completely redundant and annoying!

Harem Soul

"All the King's Men" pulls back the black curtain of the Arab harem. The slim and plump, the warblers and swallows, are really beautiful. Marlene Dietrich's erotic dance is deeply seductive. Secondly, let's talk about "A Thousand and One Nights," there are also many concubines in the harem competing for beauty. "Harem Soul" does not have these confusing scenes, there are no beautiful women, and no pleasant songs and dances. James Tinling is worthy of his name, but he is also powerless, and Marilyn Maxwell is only beautiful. Leaving these aside, Albert S. Rogell's gimmicks are still many. Just talking about being hilarious, although not as good as "Charley's Aunt," it is also acceptable. That's all. Hollywood's slapstick comedy is at a crossroads, I don't know where to go.

### Rambling Talk about Cursive Script

— Zhang Zhenlü

"Characters like earthworms are dragons and snakes, everyone says that Celestial Master Zhang is their ancestor. I also have no other way to turn copper into gold, just塗(tu) up with ink and exchange for white blossoms." This is a short poem that I wrote in front of my fee schedule in previous years, because a colleague jokingly called my calligraphy as Celestial Master Zhang's drawing of talismans. Indeed, cursive script is written continuously, and it looks like a talisman. It is a fact that it is not easy for everyone to recognize and is difficult to be widely used. Most of the cursive characters written by ordinary people are sloppy and disrespectful, and each person just writes their own cursive style.

To give an example: Even a wise man like Mr. Lin Yutang once published my "Rambling Talk about Cursive Painting" (signed Zhang Huang) in his edited "This Human World." All the titles, catalogs, and various newspaper advertisements were all transformed into "Cursive Script Theory." It was clearly miscellaneous essays, but it was transformed into a solemn theory, probably because the second "cursive" character I wrote was too cursive and was mistaken.

As a cursive script lover like me, I also hope that cursive script will become popular. But the cursive script that everyone uses is mostly mixed with broken characters, lowercase, simplified characters, and even the writing style of account books. The regular cursive script of "Shrimp and Egg Fried Rice" is far less convenient than "Shrimp and Egg Fried Rice" under the busy pen of a restaurant's ledger, and is familiar to diners. The fancy names on pawn tickets are habitually written in cursive, and ordinary people are stunned and don't know what to say. The Ministry of Education once promoted standard simplified characters, but immediately withdrew its order. Today's wise men advocate cursive script to save time, and I absolutely express my admiration, considering it a superior statement.

From an artistic point of view, calligraphy is originally a unique art in our country, and cursive script undoubtedly occupies the best of all calligraphy. Since cursive script is more in line with the principles of painting, the aesthetic conditions are also more complete. Without great artistic talent and the skills of learning and cultivation, how can one write a beautiful cursive script work? Therefore, cursive script is a matter for artists, and they can devote their lives to it. What we must first advocate is how to increase everyone's interest in cursive script.

The ancients said: "Regular script is like sitting, running script is like walking, and cursive script is like running." It is true that cursive script should be written quickly like running, but this only indicates a part of it. There are many ways to write a cursive character, and it must be adapted to local conditions. The size and density between characters should be matched, and the encroachment and concession between lines should be carefully considered. It is not enough to just run. Moreover, the posture of cursive script is either unrestrained like river waves, or firm like mountains, or flowing like gossamer, or ancient and clumsy like mottled moss stones. It is indeed that the intention arrives and the pen follows, with no doubt or stagnation, and the twists and turns, and the bone strength are sought to be complete, which cannot be exhausted by just running. Thinking that Zhang Xu's cursive script improved after watching a sword dance, and Wen Yuke realized the principles of cursive script after seeing snake fights, both have nothing to do with running. I think it is better to say: "Regular script is like sitting, running script is like walking, and cursive script is like dancing."

Su Shi felt that the air of wine was coming from between his ten fingers after writing cursive script after drinking. Huaisu's autobiography said: I write two or three lines at will when drunk, but I can't collect the book after waking up. The divine strokes are mostly produced in a state of intoxication, which is common among literati and artists, not only cursive script masters.

Although cursive script masters are not born every generation, if we take the norms of the predecessors and develop our own ingenuity, we should get modern people who are better than the ancients. Why are there so few cursive script talents in recent times? And people in Japan are studying and researching it more and more. They have extensively collected and printed our country's calligraphy, painting, and inscriptions, doing their best to collect and extensively learn, and there is a great trend of cursive style spreading eastward. Looking at it this way, we might as well not ask for outstanding cursive script masters, but make it an urgent task to improve the intellectual level of ordinary compatriots.

### On the Lake —Third Notes of a Trip to Yunnan—

— Lin Yongquan

It's autumn.

The flat rice grains all bow their heads because of the burden of their abundant fruits. Their faded and residual yellow clothes are torn by the autumn wind in a chaotic manner, and some are lying together. Some green and vibrant Chen dreams; the sound of gurgling raindrops playing in the rice paddies when they were young, and the scene of dragonflies hovering and looking around, can only be recalled in the old age of this species.

The stone lion sitting in Sanpai Fang is now moved to the front of Kunhu Elementary School. In the past, it overlooked the pedestrians on the street and seemed to be an inanimate object cheering for the one or two officials who called themselves "kings" at that time. Now, it can only squat at the low doorway, allowing the children who are just beginning to know things to play with and mock it. The changes of the times are like this, will the changes of thought also be like this? We don't know if there will be children who want to ride the lion and become kings in the future?

When I arrived at the gate of Daguanlou, it was still quiet. Perhaps because it was not a holiday, there were almost no tourists. Some were just one or two couples talking affectionately, who were unwilling to socialize with others and specially chose a quiet place to whisper and prepare for some possible developments. There were also young men and women who were hurrying to take a small boat, making aquatic dreams and looking for another kind of warm affection. Tang Jiyao's equestrian bronze statue; the long couplet of the Qimen; the tigers, leopards, peacocks, apes, and black bears in the zoo; as well as all the arrangements and buildings, and all the flowers and plants, were not noticed by them.

The grassy sea near the building is often the destination of tourists, and mostly because they can take a boat there, in order to taste the taste of "setting sail" and "riding the wind and waves" in this vast sea—Yunnan people call Dianchi Lake the sea. A dozen small sampans were parked under the willow shade of a small pier that had not been specially built, quietly waiting for customers, and their owners were soliciting business on the narrow road by the lake. The lonely lakeside was often disturbed by the arguing over prices.

When on the lake, the calm lake water was wrinkled by the casual and inadvertent breeze. Also, because of the boat's propulsion, there were always two slightly curled locks of hair separating on both sides of the bottom of the boat. Sometimes the wind blew stronger, and all the water surface was laughing passionately. Like a group of playful children, holding on to each other and hugging each other; forming a wall, forming a long embankment. But then it collapsed and fell into a pot-shaped round bottom, and the complicated laughter had a temporary respite. But the arms of those who came later continued to rush up, and the chuckling laughter seemed to never end.

These boats, these pieces of wood that often hoisted a small sail, were always drifting silently on this lake, and even attracted those white gulls that were always bathing their white feathers. Sometimes they circled above the bottom of the lake; sometimes they kissed the clear face of the bottom of the lake. The lonely lake water, the lonely boat, and the lonely distant mountains, and the lonely village on the lake shore; all seemed to show joy, liveliness, happiness, and peace because of their comfortable game.

The lake water rises and falls with the seasons; the lake shore and the distant mountains wither and flourish, and become desolate and familiar with the seasons. But the lonely, unchanging boats are forever moored on the lake shore and drifting on the lake. Even though they also have irregular reproduction and death, new manufacturing and destruction, we, who are transient passers-by touring the lake, cannot think of these things.

Gradually it was dusk, and the evening wind on the lake became urgent. From afar, the faint returning sails floated towards the building and gathered towards the misty bay of tall trees and long bamboo. The quiet lakeside was lit with stars of fishing fire.

### The Finger Painting Artist, Teng Baiye

— Xu Shiqi

More than a decade ago, when I lived in Nanjing, art enthusiasts organized a painting and calligraphy society named "Hui She." We met twice a week to discuss and learn from each other, which was immensely enjoyable. The friends in the society were all outstanding talents of the time. Mr. Teng Baiye was renowned in artistic circles for his versatility and skill in creating finger paintings and calligraphy. When the War of Resistance against Japan broke out, the national government moved west, and the members dispersed. Baiye went far to Guilin, where he absorbed the beauty of the southwestern mountains and rivers. Although he endured many hardships, his understanding broadened, and his art became more refined, largely due to the help of nature. After the victory, we met again in the wartime capital, Chongqing. Surviving the war felt like another lifetime. Then we met again in Shanghai.

Baiye grew up in Jiangnan and was known as a child prodigy. He had great artistic talent and excelled in various forms of visual arts, such as sculpture, painting, and architecture. However, he was particularly skilled in finger painting. He could create landscapes, flowers, and birds with a single stroke, completing as many as a dozen or twenty paintings a day with such speed. Years ago, he studied in America, attending Harvard University. His exhibited works received great acclaim. After returning to China, he taught Chinese art history at Yenching University in Peiping.

In addition to his painting skills, Baiye was also highly skilled in sculpture. His works were displayed in national art exhibitions and admired by connoisseurs. In the spring of 1937, the capital city proposed erecting a bronze statue of the founding father, Mr. Sun Yat-sen, in Xinjiekou Square. Designs and models were collected from artists nationwide, and leading figures in the party and state anonymously voted to select the winner. Baiye was chosen as the top candidate. However, as preparations were underway, the Marco Polo Bridge Incident broke out, engulfing the entire country, and the project was halted. Now, with the victory of the War of Resistance, it is hoped that the project can be revived, his plan realized, and the work completed, leaving a lasting memorial in the capital.

This exhibition features over a hundred recent finger paintings, including the richness of peonies, the elegance of bamboo and rocks, the secluded beauty of cloud-covered peaks and waterfalls, and the vigorous strength of wisteria. The works are vivid, like living beings, full of natural life, and create a new style in Chinese painting, making them highly valuable. The Qing Dynasty painter Gao Qipei, styled Qieyuan, from Liaoyang, was skilled in poetry and finger painting. He was adept at painting figures, flowers, trees, fish, dragons, birds, and animals, fully mastering the art. While Baiye was influenced by him, he has truly surpassed his predecessor. Connoisseurs who see his work will surely believe that my words are not exaggerated.

### Painting of the Xiao and Xiang Rivers

— Xu Bangda

Mr. Xu Bangda is skilled in poetry and painting, and his calligraphy is also exquisite. He has a rich collection, studying and learning without blindly imitating, allowing his natural talent to shine. He is now acceding to the request of fellow enthusiasts by holding a solo exhibition for a week. The above image is one of the exhibited works, with its free and elegant brushwork, mellow and rich artistic flavor, and profound and refreshing artistic conception, both vast and charming.

### Reading Notes on Hou Xiang's Paintings

— Yang Kailing

Life is but a few decades. To prolong it, one must rely on external forces; otherwise, one will decay like grass and trees. The means to pass down one's legacy include achievements, writings, or remarkable and exceptional actions. Therefore, talented artists strive to learn, not caring whether their names are remembered, but hoping that their actions will be outstanding in their time. They exhaust their minds and hearts, enduring hardship, to pursue boundless knowledge with their limited lives, relishing the bitterness like sweetness.

Mr. Hou Xiang, styled Huahua, is from Dongli, Wuxi. His family, starting with Qi Zhuweng in the early Ming Dynasty, became known for their literary and political achievements, and the prosperity of scholars and officials continued for fourteen generations. Mr. Hou's ancestors and father were all skilled in poetry and painting, deeply influenced by the family's scholarly traditions. From a young age, he immersed himself in the study of classics, history, and literature. His parallel prose already amazed his elders. Later, he joined the army, traveling through Yan, Qi, Wu, and Yue. However, his proud nature prevented him from pandering to others. He returned to his hometown on foot and devoted himself to reading and studying, often staying up all night. After the age of twenty, he began studying painting with Mr. Ding Yunxuan, learning from Lin Liang, Zhou Zhimian, Yun Nantian, and Jiang Nansha, eventually reaching the level of Hua Xinluo. Therefore, his brushwork is ancient and elegant, and his compositions are deep and stable. Renowned figures such as Qiu Kefu and Wu Zhihui have praised him. Recently, Mr. Wu Zhihui and Mr. Ding Fubao selected over fifty of his works and exhibited them at the Yunlin Painting and Calligraphy Society on Rue Lupan and Rue Paul Beau for seven days. Among them are over twenty works of flowers, birds, insects, and fish, with powerful and profound brushwork and ancient and secluded colors, blending the styles of Baiyang and Xinluo into one. His occasional small poems are reminiscent of the late Tang Dynasty and Lu You's style, with elegant rhymes and careful adherence to meter, truly establishing him as a master. The over ten figure paintings, especially the paintings of children playing, celebrating the Lantern Festival, and carrying dragon lanterns, are full of natural charm, without any worldly or historical airs. His calligraphy follows the styles of the two Wangs, with Wen Zhengming and Wang Yayi as his models. The over ten landscape paintings are mostly in the style of Huang He Shanqiao, with layered mountains and peaks, emerald cliffs and green peaks, and a misty and moist atmosphere, following the ancients without being constrained by them. Other works, such as his copies of Shi Xi and Shi Tao, all reveal unique and captivating scenery. The two handscrolls, one copying Shen Zhou's landscape and the other Zhou Zhimian's flowers, transform their original styles, with a simple, unadorned, and honest air, deeply capturing the essence of the ancient masters. After quickly reading this several times, I jumped for joy and praised him.

Since the national crisis, Mr. Hou has secluded himself for ten years, using poetry, painting, and calligraphy to express himself. From morning to night, he took out his treasured collection, studying and imitating them, like a hermit in the mountains. Even the cries of his children, the cold, the sounds of airplanes, and the terrifying bombings did not disturb him. Later, he traveled to the outskirts of Cheng and Xi, to the shores of the Yangtze River and Taihu Lake, capturing the ever-changing smoke and clouds and the vast waves with his brush. Therefore, he can transform the unpredictable and reveal the secrets of nature. Now, Mr. Wu Zhihui, at the age of eighty-two, personally inscribed his works, greatly encouraging future scholars. The peonies and green leaves complement each other, making Mr. Hou deeply grateful and further encouraging him to strive in his art to live up to the expectations of his predecessors.

### An Inch of Mountains and Rivers, an Inch of Blood 138

— Ye Jingfeng

There was no one to relay messages, no one to lead the way. Hejian could only follow the small path taken by that monocled gentleman, crossing the garden. Everything was exactly the same as the previous visit. Hejian felt that the guard at the entrance of Beppu's residence was the same old friend from the previous night. Hejian had a good memory, having received special training, so he was sure he wasn't mistaken.

"How can things be so coincidental?" Hejian thought to himself. The tranquility on the road outside Beppu's residence, the calmness within, and the same guard at his post made Hejian feel somewhat suspicious and strange. According to the investigation, there were more than twenty guards stationed at Beppu's residence. Due to the "isolation" policy, these guards must be rotated daily. Hejian's two visits were only two days apart. How could he have been assigned the same person again? Although the matter was small, it was a noteworthy issue in the eyes of an intelligence operative.

Hejian nodded at the guard and was about to ask a question when he heard footsteps from inside the hall. Under the dim light, someone hurried out.

"Good evening, Mr. Hejian." It was Beppu's secretary again.

"Good evening... Good evening, sir," Hejian had not inquired about his name and could only offer a vague greeting.

"Pardon my tardiness," the secretary said, gesturing an invitation. He turned and walked ahead, passing the door of the waiting room from the previous visit. He didn't stop but turned a corner and led Hejian into a larger reception room. This reception room was not only twice the size of the previous waiting room, but it was also decorated in a completely Western style, quite luxurious, likely used to entertain foreign guests and confidants.

"Please, sit wherever you like, Mr. Hejian," the secretary's attitude was much friendlier than the first time, as if he were entertaining a friend. "The minister is currently busy with official duties. He will not be free for at least half an hour. When it's time for your audience, I will naturally come and invite you... If you have any documents, please hand them over first..." He then offered a slight bow.

"Regarding the documents, I have a letter here from the General Staff Headquarters' Secretariat, ordering me to present it," Hejian said, handing the document to the secretary with both hands.

"Thank you for your trouble, please make yourself comfortable." The secretary took the document and was about to leave, but he saw that Hejian seemed to have something more to say, so he stopped.

"I was negligent last time and didn't inquire about your name. I apologize." Hejian said, also giving a bow.

"Nishihara Hisaji. I dare not ask for instruction. I hope you will enlighten me." He said, returning a bow, adhering to the saying, "More courtesy is never wrong."

"Mr. Nishihara." Hejian quickly took out a cigarette, preparing to launch his offensive. "I know you are very busy. I have a few questions I would like to ask. I wonder if you would be willing to spare a minute or two?"

"Thank you. I am not a fan of cigarettes or alcohol!" Nishihara refused Hejian's cigarette. "I dare not give instruction. I am willing to explain anything within my duties. As for other matters, I am very foolish and understand nothing."

To pry even a few secrets from a Japanese person's mouth is equivalent to hoping for a mute to sing, absolutely impossible. Unless this fellow is a drunkard, perhaps one could get something out of him after he's drunk. But Hejian wanted to try his luck with his clever skills.

"The military affairs on the mainland are very busy. You know that," Hejian said, looking at his watch. "It's already 10:30. According to my calculations, I should already be flying over the strait. But in fact, I'm still standing in Tokyo. Perhaps you can shed some light on this matter?"

"Ah,... um... oh,... yes..." This was Nishihara's reply.

"It's 10:30 now," Hejian refused to give up and launched another offensive. "You said the minister will be busy for at least another half an hour. If I calculate correctly, I probably won't be able to see him until after 11:00?"

"Half an hour is just an estimated guess," the mute finally spoke. "That's what the minister said. I can only relay his instructions. Other than that, I probably don't know anything." He said, giving another half-bow, formally turning around, exiting the room, and closing the door behind him.

"Half an hour?... Humph!" Hejian watched the fellow leave, thinking to himself. "Wait and see, I don't think it will take half an hour, unless my plan completely fails!" With a sneer, he chose a large single sofa, sat down comfortably, leaned back, assumed a half-sleeping position, looked up at the chandelier hanging in the center of the room, and took several deep drags of his cigarette.

### Public Buses

— Shaofu

Since the launch of the public bus management office, the main transportation in the city has become much more convenient, and the citizens have benefited greatly. This is worth praising.

However, we have some opinions regarding the route issue. Take Route 7 as an example, from Zhongzheng Park to Zhabei Road Bridge, passing through Avenues Foch, and Jiaxing Road, etc. This avoids conflicts with trolley Routes 1 and 2, which is a good design, but why does it stop at Zhabei Road Bridge? Why not cross the bridge to the Bund on Beijing Road, or Renji Road on Yuanyuanmingyuan Road? Because crossing the bridge would provide more convenience for the citizens in the Hongkou area. It would also reduce the congestion of trolley Route 1.

Many people have this opinion, and we hope that the management office can consider improvements.

Secondly, Route 10 runs from Jing'an Temple to the Bund. On this route, there are trolley Routes 1 and 2, especially Route 2, which is particularly frequent. Therefore, most people advocate avoiding the same routes as the above two trolley routes, while the starting and ending points can remain the same. There are also too many vehicles on Nanjing Road, which can also reduce traffic congestion.

We wonder if the management office can also consider this point?

### Starting with the Price-Revised Stamps

— Zi

"All stamps are revised in price, and without revision, there is no increase."

It should be a pleasant thing to receive some mail every day. Even now, I often look forward to letters and printed materials from afar, like waiting for a love letter in first love. But this joy sometimes only "flashes in the pan" and disappears. Because I often receive express airmail that is slower than regular mail, and special issues of newspapers from other places for the Double Ten Festival and the Premier's birthday surprisingly arrive together on the same day!

I started "collecting stamps" at the age of six and have continued to collect them every day for more than twenty years. Although my stamp albums have been lost several times, I have still been "building a home from scratch" as much as possible in the past two years. Perhaps this is a person's hobby. To outsiders, what's the point of collecting a few stamps from domestic letters? But I think there is some meaning in it, or rather, some big problems can be revealed in these stamps.

In the "terminology" of "stamp collecting," there is something called "price-revised stamps," which refers to those whose face value when used is different from the original. Stamp collectors regard "price-revised stamps" as a new version and collect them as well, and they are often more expensive than the original stamps. Recently, what I have seen in the mail I received are these "price-revised stamps."

I remember that in my lost stamp albums, there were "price-revised stamps" during the reign of Empress Dowager Cixi, with the imprinted lead characters seeming to be "temporarily used as one cent in silver dollars." There were also "price-revised stamps" in the early years of the Republic of China, the first of which seemed to be three cents revised to two cents. Afterwards, there were more, but they always revised larger values to smaller ones, seemingly to counterfeit and cheat. Each issue only had one type, and the circulation time would not last longer than two or three months, unlike now, when almost "all stamps are revised in price, and without revision, there is no increase." To be clear, now the price-revised stamps are all small stamps revised to large ones, and the multiples are shockingly large. The variety is astonishing.

We often talk about inflation, but we are not sure to what extent it has inflated. But every time I see that the yellow one-cent martyr image stamp has been revised to one hundred yuan, I calculate it as 10,000 times, which stuns me. And there is more, the three-cent stamp is revised to five hundred yuan. Perhaps there are even greater multipliers. This kind of "price revision" can be used as an illustration in modern financial history.

In the more than 20,000 stamps I have collected, in terms of country, the most are of course from China, followed by Germany. The large number of German stamps is also due to the unspeakable number of "price-revised stamps" after the First World War. Later, the Germans couldn't keep up with the revisions, so they only printed blank stamps, with only the design printed on the stamp and an empty frame in the center, with a blank line below. The number of "marks" was temporarily printed with a lead character number in the central frame, and below that was an array of "〇" characters like soldiers in formation?

The face value of one of the German stamps I collected reached tens of billions of marks!

At that time, my older brother often brought back many used old envelope covers from a German foreign firm. I remember very clearly that although the postage for each letter sent to China was constantly and sharply increasing, eight or nine out of ten stamps on each envelope were only one stamp—a "price-revised stamp" or a stamp with a temporarily added number—and rarely more than two.

(More than ten years later, hearing that the Nazis' propaganda and securities for the invasion of Czechoslovakia were all printed and prepared one or two years before the incident, I therefore did not find it strange.)

Looking back at our China, the post office repeatedly asks senders not to affix countless small-denomination stamps to make up the postage for a mailing, but recently, in order to buy stamps for an overweight airmail letter requiring 750 yuan, the postal worker handed me as many as seventeen through the window? And all of them were "price-revised stamps"! I patiently affixed all seventeen stamps, one by one, while thinking about the fact that the country had to pay thirty-four times the printing costs, and the postal worker had to make sixteen extra stamping motions! I felt very sad.

The story is not over. This overweight letter of mine was already the required forty centimeters in size (because I wanted to save on postage, so I always weighed it on a balance before sending it). I don't know if I used too much glue, but heavens, after the seventeen stamps were glued on, the weight had already exceeded forty centimeters, and I had to add another 250 yuan in postage. But it was not easy to stick these seven stamps on the bottom of my envelope.

The letter had to be sent, so I had no choice but to write on the bottom of the envelope: "Please forgive the postal worker, because the postal window didn't have hundred-yuan stamps, so I had to combine two to make the amount."

I also wrote a line on the envelope, asking the recipient to return this envelope to me. At first, I only wanted to use it as one of my stamp collections, but after thinking more deeply, it seemed that I could also prepare it for someone to use as an illustration when writing about "old master politics" or "bureaucracy."

From now on, I vow never to collect any "price-revised stamps" again. From now on, I will regard them as a shameful mark of delay, waste, and incompetence.

### Rhapsody

— Pingzhang

There is "Wang Baochuan," who is a "beauty that could topple kingdoms" and a "gone with the wind" in a time of chaos, bearing the "secret mission" of "counterattacking Burma" and "directly attacking Tokyo."

One day, "Wang Baochuan" carried "secret weapons" to investigate the "secrets of the Nazis." Unfortunately, she was trapped by "Japanese spies" of the "Black Dragon Society." Fortunately, she was saved by the "number one sharpshooter" and was able to "escape."

"Wang Baochuan" looked like a "lotus emerging from water." Although she had a "heart of iron," she could not help but fall into the "abyss" of "love." "Wang Baochuan" also had thoughts of "flying wing to wing," but "a fallen flower has an owner." She had already dedicated herself to "serving the country," so she did not want to "seek trouble." However, the "sharpshooter" was a "stubborn and affectionate man." He invited his "lover" to "Girl City" in a letter during "Christmas" to spend this "carnival" together and prepared "diamonds" and "jewel flowers" as gifts. But "Wang Baochuan" replied:

"Sharpshooter":

You are a "good young man," please don't have "romantic troubles"!

Our motherland is at a "critical moment," and now is the "time for young people to aspire"! Please join the "Intelligence Suicide Squad" or the "Guerrilla Suicide Squad" to bring glory to "unyielding China," ignite the "spark of national revival," and "walk with me," then "we will meet again one day! I wish you

"A bright future"!

The "sharpshooter" indeed became a "passionate man," "brave and unmatched in the three armies," "recaptured Midway Island," and opened a "bloody path" for "advancing China"!

### Morning Tea

— Fangwen

Getting up early in the morning, a cup of morning tea can clear the mind and prolong life.

Chinese morning tea, scallion pancakes, soy milk, fried dough sticks, and porridge are the most common. Foreign morning tea, milk, toast, eggs, and oatmeal are similar. Although Chinese and foreign customs are different, the ingredients should be light and simple.

There is an ancient secret to preserving health: "Breakfast should be early, lunch should be full, and dinner should be light." It can be seen that morning tea should be early, in addition to being light and simple.

Wealthy families in Shanghai like to eat ginseng soup, white fungus, bird's nest, and chicken juice every morning instead of morning tea. It is said that tonic in the morning is especially effective.

Farmers in the countryside have long had the custom of eating morning tea. In small teahouses in towns and villages, thatched houses, paper windows, wooden tables, and long benches, all the talented people gather early in the morning. As the saying goes: "The seats are always full of guests, and the teapot is never empty." A pot of clear tea, a few puffs of yellow smoke, high-spirited discussions, north and south, without restraint.

Guangdong people are as particular about supper as they are about morning tea. Suzhou people are also very authentic about morning tea, making it a daily must-do. Nanjing people have long had a reputation for eating morning tea. Although Shanghai people have the habit of eating morning tea, they are too late, and it always feels like they have lost the meaning of the word "early."

### The Organization of Beggars 24

The Secrets of Snakes and Beggars

Snake beggars often catch venomous snakes for people's homes in return for payment. Whenever a wealthy family has a snake problem in their yard, they hire them to catch it, and they never fail. Snake beggars are also happy to do this and do not ask for exorbitant prices. This is not because snake beggars value righteousness over wealth, but because the snakes they catch are sometimes extremely valuable, and the people always give them away unconditionally. In each area of the inland, there are always fixed snake beggars patrolling through each town and village every month.

Everything that has advantages also has disadvantages. Some snake beggars are cunning by nature. Sometimes, because business is slow, they secretly put trained snakes into the yards of wealthy families. Even if they are not poisonous, they can harm children and livestock, often causing chaos. So the wealthy family has no choice but to ask them to catch them, thereby obtaining a large profit. Sometimes, if the wealthy family does not ask, the snake beggar takes the initiative to knock on the door, claiming that there are venomous snakes in their residence and that if the people do not believe him, he can identify the smell of snakes and never fail. He is willing to catch them first and then be paid, to eliminate endless harm. The people naturally agree out of fear of disaster. So the snake beggar shows off his skills, first playing a short flute, the melody melancholic and moving. The snake hears the sound of the beggar's flute, uses the food to lure it, and the snake automatically comes out to be bound. After receiving the payment, the snake beggar leaves with the snake in his bag and can release it again in another home. The time between catching and releasing is probably no more than ten days. If it is too long, the snake will find a new hole or go elsewhere. People in the gang call it "losing the earth dragon's nest." Then they have to admit their bad luck, as the saying goes, "Trying to steal a chicken but losing the rice."

Snake beggars also automatically catch snakes to kill and sell the snake gall and snake skin to passersby. This is also a regular business, called "copying goods."

Kind men and devout women have the habit of releasing animals. Snake beggars take advantage of the mentality of Buddhist disciples to sell the caught small and medium-sized snakes to people for release. On the banks of West Lake, during Buddhist festivals, when crowds of people are worshipping and offering incense, it is their golden day. The business of selling snakes is very prosperous. These are all non-venomous water snakes. They are released today and caught by the snake beggar tomorrow to be sold again. The monks who manage the release pond of the Buddhist temple inevitably collude with the snake beggars, allowing them to catch the snakes again to sell. In the end, they are just deceiving the money of kind men and devout women.

Snake feces are the most valuable thing on a snake's body. But because snake feces are hard to come by, they are valuable because they are rare. When snake beggars obtain snake feces, it is said to be turning into gold. Originally, snake feces are "serpentine yellow." In addition to being a valuable medicine in the Chinese pharmacopoeia, it is also the best natural yellow color in pigments, and its value is very high. Every time they "turn into gold," it is a wealthy day for snake beggars to look down on their peers.

The most powerful gang of snake beggars is called the "Panhua Pole." The gang's ancestral snake medicine travels throughout the north and south of the Yangtze River. They have rich experience in capturing large snakes. Their active areas are all the temperate regions of central China. Their footprints do not cross the Guandong region north of the Great Wall. The gang calls this "not going to the village." The "village" refers to Shanhaiguan and Hangu Pass. This is because the climate outside the pass is cold, and snakes are not easy to survive. New beggars entering the gang have very strict rules. They must first apprentice to a teacher and worship their ancestors, and first follow the teacher for three years doing the work of an assistant "holding the pole," which means catching and raising snakes. Only after they have mastered the art can they go out on the streets to beg, starting to appear to the world as snake beggars.

### Reflections on Returning Home

— Kang Shi

The New Year's Day of the thirty-sixth year (1947) suddenly saw the heavens smiling, radiating "brightness"—truly an auspicious omen. Taking advantage of the holiday, I returned to Min (Fujian) for a family visit. Among my observations, I formed two main impressions.

The first is the deep suffering of the farmers. Rice prices are so low that they hurt the farmers, and cotton is even cheaper than rice. Consequently, the purchasing power in the rural areas around the towns is drastically lower than in previous years. Originally, Minhang relied heavily on the rice and cotton industry due to its strategic location as a hub for both water and land transport. Now, affected by the economic downturn, although no "bankruptcies" have occurred, it is said that several businesses are struggling to survive. Observing the decline and desolation of commerce throughout the town, I cannot help but lament the contrast between past and present. As the thirty-sixth year begins, the situation of "one farmer's failure bringing down a hundred merchants" is truly worrying!

The second impression is that the Resources Committee is said to have requisitioned 500 acres of farmland in Pubin, west of the town, to build a machinery factory. This has been brewing for half a year, and is now being implemented. The "private farmland," "private houses," and "graves" within the requisitioned area are being purchased or relocated with compensation. Most of the farmland has already been acquired with payment, posing no significant issue. However, the "private houses" and "graves" have caused unrest among the local people. It is said that the "relocation fees" are too low, and the people are already impoverished. Although the establishment of a machinery factory would contribute to national construction and boost the local economy, how can these many "private houses" find new homes with such minimal compensation? Moreover, the relocation fee for "graves" is only tens of thousands of yuan. Chinese customs place great importance on the remains of ancestors. For the sake of national construction, we may not dwell on superstitious Feng Shui beliefs, but are tens of thousands of yuan sufficient to cover labor costs and public cemetery fees for relocation? Therefore, the affected residents are voicing strong opposition. The authorities have reportedly changed their approach, allowing residents of the requisitioned "private houses" to work in the factory, and planning to designate a public cemetery for the relocation of graves. However, whether this can be realized depends on whether the authorities can truly "understand the people's hardships." We believe that "the way of governance lies in benevolence," and that we should not gain in one area while losing in another!

### On Chinese Characters

— De Cai

The issue of polysyllabic words has been repeatedly discussed in "Free Talk." However, in my humble opinion, before discussing this issue, it seems valuable to first research and discuss the essential meaning and connotation of Chinese characters.

According to my presumptuous view: The Chinese language is the most excellent language in the world; Chinese characters are the most excellent script in the world.

Simplicity

Language is the use of sounds to represent a meaning or thing. Writing is the use of symbols to represent a meaning or thing. The most important requirements are simplicity, clarity, and lucidity. Our language completely uses monosyllables to represent single characters, and single characters to represent a single meaning or thing, making it as simple as it can possibly be. For example, 桌 (zhuō, table) is a single syllable, while in English it is "Table" and in Japanese it is "芝柯哀 (kikazari)" (stool), both consisting of three syllables. The speed comparison is three to one. Therefore, when delivering a speech expressing the same meaning, speaking in Chinese can save at least half the time compared to any other country in the world. This advantage is beyond the reach of any other country.

The same applies to writing: The writing systems of all countries in the world are linear, capable of indefinite extension backwards. Only our writing is planar, with very strict restrictions. It designates a small square space as a character, representing a meaning or thing, and that character is limited to a single syllable. Therefore, if a Chinese text is translated into the writing of any other country in the world, it will be longer than the Chinese text, and will never be shorter. Using the same method to record the same meaning, Chinese should be the first choice in saving time and materials in terms of writing.

Simplification

Based on the above reasons, creating polysyllabic characters not only seems to be blindly imitating Europeanization, but actually seems to be a step backwards. "　", creating new characters is one thing, this word can sound like "馆" (guǎn, building), and the meaning is library. Applying it in writing can indeed save time. If it can be universally recognized, we might as well create several similar characters: 圈，　，　，　，　，　，　， These numbers all sound "馆" (guǎn, building), but have different meanings: (1) Photo studio, (2) Restaurant, (3) Teahouse, (4) Movie theater, (5) Opera hall, (6) Funeral home, (7) Gymnasium. In this way, □ obviously succeeds in becoming another new radical in the dictionary, but the meaning is a group.

As for the commonly used compound words in our country, such as: "鳳凰 (fèng huáng, phoenix)", "鴛鴦 (yuān yāng, mandarin duck)", "梧桐 (wú tóng, Chinese parasol tree)", "枇杷 (pí pá, loquat)", which are different analyses of male and female of the same category, is also a precise feature of Chinese characters, and now forcibly merging them into 　,　, seems to be superfluous and confusing.

However, inspired by the previous section, we feel that the simpler the characters, the better, and the fewer the strokes, the better. Simplifying the current complex Chinese characters as much as possible is definitely worth promoting. For example: "价 (jià)" to replace "價 (jià, price)"; "　" to replace "門 (mén, door)"; "　" for "時 (shí, time)"; "鉀 (jiǎ)" for "鐘 (zhōng, clock)"; "步 (bù)" for "歲 (suì, year)"; "斷 (duàn)" for "斷 (duàn, cut)"; "点 (diǎn)" for "點 (diǎn, point)"; "鉄 (tiě)" for "鐵 (tiě, iron)"; "獻 (xiàn)" for "獻 (xiàn, dedicate)"; "　" for "戲 (xì, play)"; "双 (shuāng)" for "雙 (shuāng, double)". The above is just a brief list of examples, but there must be many more characters that can be simplified. Such a change will definitely have great benefits for saving time.

Furthermore, the function words in our language are also considered mysterious and rigid. In fact, function words are the punctuation marks in vernacular language: "也 (yě)" — . "乎 (hū)" — ? "耶 (yē)" — ? "焉 (yān)" — ; "歟 (yú)" — ?! "哉 (zāi)" — !? "之 (zhī)" — , "者 (zhě)" — ; "耳 (ěr)" —…

Therefore, the function words in classical Chinese are actually our old-fashioned punctuation marks. Compared to the new style, they are not as simple and should be eliminated.

Furthermore, there is a difference between classical Chinese and vernacular Chinese. Classical Chinese is a shorthand form of vernacular Chinese. Although it is not colloquial, it is indeed inappropriate to use it as introductory teaching material for popularizing general education, but it has its own undeniable place and value for shorthand. The decline of classical Chinese is due to (1) the decline in general cultural standards, and (2) the immature shorthand skills of those who write classical Chinese, as well as their punctuation - namely function words. After the promotion of Chinese culture, if we want to save time and simplify articles, we will still get closer to classical Chinese.

Excellence

Chinese characters are actually too excellent. Not only do some people not cherish them, but they despise them and think they are outdated. Chinese characters do have their inherent value. I hope that "Free Talk" can submit this to the Weekly Miscellany as a special topic, so that everyone can express more opinions to discuss and research, in order to determine whether Chinese characters are excellent or not!
