### Zhu Jiahua Issues a Stern Statement Condemning the Soviet Foreign Minister's Suggestion, The Youth Party Also Issues a Solemn Statement

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 12th] Zhu Jiahua, Chairman of the United Nations Chinese Association, issued a statement today regarding the Soviet Foreign Minister's suggestion to discuss the Chinese issue at the Moscow Conference. He stated that China joined the World War earliest and contributed greatly. Before Japan's impending surrender in the autumn of 1945, the Soviet Union was still acting as a mediator for Japan, requesting conditional surrender from the Allied nations. Today, it has taken such an insulting action against China, its most loyal ally, violating laws and infringing on rights. Nothing is more outrageous than this! It is already a violation of the Potsdam Agreement that China was not invited to participate in the Foreign Ministers Conference, and discussing the China issue is even more a violation of the United Nations Charter.

[Central News Agency, This City] Regarding Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov's proposal to include the "China Issue" on the agenda of the Four Foreign Ministers Conference, the Chinese Youth Party issued a solemn statement yesterday, the original text of which is as follows:

"China is a nation that, after eight years of arduous struggle, finally brought about the downfall of Japanese fascism. Its position in the Far East is to protect its allies, without any hesitation, and to fight to the death against both Eastern and Western fascist nations, ultimately achieving success. The qualifications it has obtained as an independent nation and its inclusion as one of the world's five major powers are not to be infringed upon or harmed by any nation. We wish to point out that China's current situation has an extremely unpleasant international background. We do not expect any international forces to resolve our disputes for us. We only hope that the international community does not exacerbate China's current situation. In other words, excluding international factors, the Chinese people can resolve China's own affairs themselves, without the need for excessive concern from friendly nations. Therefore, we believe that the Chinese nation cannot be bound by any discussions among the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union outside the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference, regardless of whether their nature is well-intentioned or ill-intentioned, and whether their form is open or secret, and as an independent country."

### Public Outrage Against Interference in Internal Affairs [Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 13th] In opposition to Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov's difficult proposal to interfere in China's internal affairs, there is widespread outrage in the capital from all sectors of society. Chairman Jiang and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs have received telegrams from the Guangzhou, Baoding, and Hefei City Councils, student bodies, and mass organizations, firmly supporting the government, safeguarding sovereignty, and students in the capital and elsewhere are preparing to hold patriotic demonstrations to protect their rights.

[Central News Agency, This City] The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, General Labor Union, Municipal Farmers' Association, Women's Association, Municipal Education Association, and other organizations, representing the four million citizens of Shanghai, jointly telegraphed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the 12th, requesting that it be forwarded to the Four Foreign Ministers Conference in Moscow, making a solemn statement firmly opposing the discussion of the Chinese issue, whether inside or outside the meeting, and urging them to recognize that the will of the Chinese people is not to be trifled with. In addition, they telegraphed compatriots across the country to respond in unison, rising up to safeguard the nation's dignity and sovereignty.

### Informal Discussion of the Chinese Issue Strongmen Issues, The Soviet Union Agrees to Invite Our Representatives

Molotov Notifies the US and British Foreign Ministers, Some Legislators Suggest the Government Participate in the Foreign Ministers Conference

[United Press, Moscow, 13th] Molotov notified Marshall and Bevin today that he agreed to discuss the Chinese issue informally outside the conference and also agreed to have Chinese representatives attend. According to Marshall's suggestion, this negotiation should be completely unrelated to the Foreign Ministers Conference, and no communiqué should be issued after the negotiation ends. The content of the talks is limited to reviewing the implementation of the 1945 Moscow Agreement among the three countries. According to US sources, Molotov's notification did not mention the date for discussing the Chinese issue or whether a communiqué would be issued after the discussion ended. It is generally believed that the Soviet Union still won a victory on the Chinese issue. Although the Chinese issue was not included in the agenda, since the three powers are discussing it, the Soviet Union can question the United States about its Far East policy, which is the Soviet Union's goal.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 13th] It is reported that some legislators will submit a proposal, based on the resolution of the Potsdam Conference of that year, suggesting that the government request to join the Foreign Ministers Conference.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 12th] There is great satisfaction here today that Marshall has rejected Molotov's suggestion to include the Chinese issue on the official agenda of the Foreign Ministers Conference. A Washington evening newspaper ran the headline "Great Powers Prevent the Soviet Union from Discussing the Chinese Issue." According to US broadcasts received here from Moscow today, Marshall contacted Washington after Molotov suggested discussing the Chinese issue yesterday. It is also known that Ambassador Gu Weijun held talks with US Deputy Secretary of State Acheson.

### American Newspapers Oppose Interference in China

[Central News Agency, New York, 12th] The Howard-owned newspaper, the World-Telegram, published an editorial today titled "Interfering in China," opposing the informal discussion of the Chinese issue by the three countries in Moscow. The newspaper stated that interference in China by the three countries would lead to another world war.

[Another Dispatch] The New York Times praised the three powers for rejecting Molotov's suggestion not to discuss the Chinese issue in a meeting without China's participation. The article stated that acceding to the Soviet Foreign Minister's request would be an unreasonable insult to a country that is one of the five major powers and a permanent member of the Security Council. There have already been too many things done without China's participation, and it is unacceptable to discuss the Chinese issue without China's participation again. According to reports, Stalin forced Roosevelt and Churchill to secretly recognize the gains in Northeast China at Yalta in Soviet territory, as the final price for the Soviet Union's participation in the war against Japan.

### Marshall's Statement Not Published in Soviet Newspapers

Yan'an Radio Accuses the United States

[Central News Agency, Moscow, 12th] Today, none of the local newspapers published Marshall's statement on the Chinese issue made at the Moscow Conference yesterday.

[United Press, Nanjing, 13th] Yan'an Radio quoted an editorial from the Liberation Daily on the 13th, saying, "The current Moscow Conference is bound to achieve success. No matter what means the reactionary elements use, they will inevitably fail." Yan'an Radio compared the United States' policy toward China to Hitler's policy toward Spain.

### The Central Committee Accepts Our Proposal, UNRA Purchases Cotton to Ship to China, The Relief Plan for China Continues

[Central News Agency, Washington, 12th] UNRRA Director Rooks announced today that the Central Committee has accepted China's proposal to use the funds not yet designated for use in the relief plan for China to purchase cotton, and has authorized the Chinese government to use the proceeds from the cotton to assist in the distribution of other relief supplies from UNRRA. The acceptance by UNRRA was based on the recommendation of the UNRRA Far East Committee after consultation with the Chinese government and the UNRRA branch office. The purchase of cotton will depend on the funds available, which also stipulates that, if necessary, the Far East Committee may, with the consent of the UNRRA branch office, approve the work of free distribution, starting from March 15th and extending for six weeks. Rooks continued: UNRRA may provide China with an additional supply of cotton worth approximately US$5 million. The US supply of cotton to China has been set at 13,810 metric tons, worth US$53,626,000, of which 81,651 metric tons have been shipped, worth US$39,700,000, 8,222 tons are currently being shipped, and 13,917 tons will be shipped in April and May. UNRRA officials told reporters that Brazil and India also have plans to ship cotton to China, but official figures have not yet been released. Rooks said: According to the State Department's order, all UNRRA supplies shipped to China must be delivered to retailers by May 31st. In addition to the additional US$5 million of cotton, it may be possible to purchase cotton worth US$10 million for shipment to China. The relief plan for China has been severely hampered due to its late start and the paralysis of the distribution system since China's eight-year war. Rooks said: Due to China's financial situation, the Chinese government must raise huge sums from its own resources, rather than from the proceeds of selling food, medicine, and other relief supplies, to support distribution work. The Chinese government had previously indicated to UNRRA its agreement to distribute cotton cloth and cotton yarn worth 45% of the total value of the cotton to the poor free of charge. The Chinese government has requested that these regulations be eased in order to raise funds needed to distribute other relief supplies. UNRRA's general relief work plan has been 85% completed. The relief plan for China, which started later, is only 66% completed and will continue.

Increased Supplies Shipped to Communist Areas

[United States Information Service, Washington, 12th] In response to questions, Rooks said: UNRRA in China is "still trying to provide relief to the Communists and has achieved some success." He said that the amount of supplies shipped to the Communist-controlled areas of China in January of this year was more than in any previous period, including 500 tons of medical supplies and clothing. These supplies were not dropped from airplanes, although other medical supplies were airlifted in this way for a short time.

### Taiwan's Martial Law Time Shortened, Most Taipei Shops Have Resumed Business

[Central News Agency, Taipei, 13th] Most shops in Taipei City have resumed business today. There are also more pedestrians on the streets.

### Representatives of Taiwanese Groups in Beijing and Shanghai Report on Their Trip to Taiwan

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 13th] Representatives of six Taiwanese groups in Beijing and Shanghai, including Yang Zhaoxi and Chen Bisheng, a total of thirteen people, previously, due to the February 28th Incident in Taiwan, voluntarily requested the government to provide transportation to Taiwan to assist the government in comforting the Taiwanese people and resolving the incident. They flew to Taiwan on a special plane on the 11th, but due to discrepancies between the plan and reality, they were hastily urged to return to Beijing on the 12th. Without contacting government authorities during their one-day stay in Beijing, they invited reporters at 4 p.m. on the 13th to report on the actual situation in Taiwan and the course of their trip. The main points are recorded as follows:

(1) Motivation for going to Taiwan: Before departure, they met with Bai Chongxi twice to discuss Taiwanese affairs, requesting several points: (A) Abolish the special administrative governor system and change to a provincial government system. (B) Abolish the monopoly system and the provincial trade. (C) Dismiss Chen Yi and punish corrupt officials. (D) Do not send troops to Taiwan to deal with the Taiwanese people with force. Bai replied at the time that sending troops to Taiwan was a matter of national defense and that he would never use force against the Taiwanese people. The special administrative governor system in politics would be abolished, and the monopoly system could also be abolished. Regarding Chen Yi's leadership in Taiwan, since such a major event occurred, Chen could no longer stay in Taiwan. Therefore, these conditions were accepted by the government, so they decided to go to Taiwan.

(2) Itinerary: On the 11th, a special plane flew to Taiwan via Shanghai in the afternoon, arriving at 5:15 p.m. By the time they rested at the hotel, it was 5:30 p.m., and they immediately contacted and met with Taiwanese people. However, starting at 7:30 p.m. that evening, they were surrounded by military police dispatched by the Administrative Governor's Office, losing their freedom to contact the outside world. Subsequently, through the results of the liaison between Division Commander He, who was sent by the Ministry of National Defense, and the Governor's Office, Chen Yi stated that he could not protect the safety of the delegation. They discussed that night and decided to return to Beijing as soon as possible on the 12th for further discussion. They arrived in Beijing at around 3 p.m. on the 12th.

(3) Actual situation in Taiwan: After the February 28th Incident, until today this month, Taipei was under the control of the people, and mainlanders could not go out. After the 8th, the opposite was true, and the authorities took repressive measures. Outside of Taipei, the government transported troops by plane. In terms of the entire Taiwan, the government can control seven cities, so if the government uses force to solve the incident, it is impossible to achieve it in the short term.

(4) Inside story of the incident: In a nutshell, this incident was a resistance by the people to the suppression of politics. The disappointment in life for more than a year and the extreme hatred for officials have now erupted in total. In addition, there is another major driving force, that is, more than 50,000 young men who had just returned to Taiwan from Hainan Island and were forcibly conscripted by the Japanese participated in the action. These more than 50,000 people are distributed in various parts of north, central and south Taiwan. This time, it was a cooperation between the people and the young men.

(5) Chen Yi's style: Chen recently drafted a three-year policy plan and decided to extend the implementation period of Taiwan's constitutional government to the 38th year of the Republic of China, because if constitutional government were implemented and the governor were elected by the people, Chen would not be able to be elected. In military affairs, Chen has been the garrison commander. In the past, the government sent the 70th Army to Taiwan, but it was not under Chen's command. Therefore, he used disguised methods to expand the army, expand the police brigade, and establish an organization of three brigades, with one brigade having 1,800 people. At the same time, he strengthened the anti-smuggling police, such as the Monopoly Bureau police and the Trade Bureau police, and established a special service regiment. Chen wanted to use this as his private force and become a disguised army. However, after the February 28th Incident, the police brigade could not fight, so almost all of the people's requests were accepted, and even the functions of the Governor's Office could hardly be carried out, and members sent by the Governor's Office and the people's organizations were responsible for handling it. Until the arrival of the National Army, Chen's attitude immediately changed, all promises were overturned, and the handling committee was dissolved.

(6) Hope that the government urgently hopes that the government can agree to our requests and fulfill its promises. If the chairman's announcement can be realized immediately, the Taiwan issue can be ended immediately.

(7) Future trends hope to meet with the chairman to report on this matter, and hope that the chairman can fulfill his promises. Finally, Yang and others, following reporters' questions, said: Chen Yi must be transferred back first, and then Bai sent, then the overall situation can be determined.

[Another Telegraph] Taiwanese representative Chen Bisheng stated at a press conference on the 13th: The report stated that Taiwanese compatriots in Hong Kong advocated for a telegram to the United Nations Conference requesting that Taiwan Province be a United Nations-mandated territory. I believe that the Taiwanese people have no such intention. If Taiwan Province wants to seek progress and reform, it must be a part of the Republic of China and must not leave the Republic of China.

### Dalian Can Be Received Next Week, Soviet Union Has Sent Notification to Our Country, Communist Troops Withdraw from the City, Most Supplies Were Transported Away

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 13th] The rumor that our country will receive Dalian on the 15th has not been officially confirmed. It is expected that the date of receipt may be within next week.

Xi went to Shanghai two days ago and will return to Beijing before the 15th. The Communist troops in Dalian have already withdrawn, but most of the supplies in the city have been transported away, and important equipment has also been damaged. Regarding the security of Dalian, Dong Yingbin, Chief of Staff of the Northeast Headquarters, also made a request to the central government when he came to Beijing on the 11th.

Editorial

### Truman's Stern Warning!

As the British and Soviet foreign ministers argued heatedly at the Moscow conference, President Truman was delivering a startling speech to the U.S. Congress, frankly warning the American people and peace-loving nations worldwide that "world peace and American security are threatened by the rise of Soviet totalitarianism." This not only dealt a severe blow to the high hopes we held for the Moscow foreign ministers' conference, but also made us hesitant to be overly optimistic about the prospects for the post-war international political situation.

I recall the harmonious atmosphere at the four-nation foreign ministers' meeting in New York last December! In particular, there seemed to be a great possibility of reconciliation between the U.S. and the Soviet Union, and it was eventually decided to draft peace treaties with Germany and Austria at the four-nation foreign ministers' meeting in Moscow today. At that time, international observers were celebrating world peace, believing that the turbulent post-war world political situation had finally found a peaceful resolution, and they harbored great hopes for the international politics of 1947, especially for the four-nation foreign ministers' meeting being held in Moscow today, predicting that genuine peace would be achieved this year. Unexpectedly, after the opening of the Moscow conference, Molotov first raised the China issue, causing an international uproar; then, at the second meeting, he arbitrarily attacked the administration in the British-occupied zone of Germany, prompting British Foreign Secretary Bevin to retort, resulting in a verbal battle at the third meeting. This gave the world a very negative impression of the Soviet Union, with everyone believing that, although the Soviet Union was chanting about world peace, its actual actions were not heading towards world peace; everyone believed that, although the Soviet Union had loudly proclaimed democracy, in practice, it still retained its totalitarian system. Therefore, President Truman's speech was not groundless but was born out of genuine concern.

After reviewing the full text of President Truman's speech released by the Associated Press, we can summarize the following key points: (1) World peace and American security are threatened by the rise of Soviet totalitarianism, so the United States should immediately send arms, money, and military advisors to Greece and Turkey to deal with communist provocations in those two countries. (2) The initial aim of American policy is to maintain the current government of Greece, making it the last bastion against communism in the Balkan Peninsula; otherwise, communism will spread to the Middle East, and the consequences will be unimaginable. (3) If the United States cannot promptly aid Greece and Turkey, the consequences will affect the West; even in the East, it will be affected, so we should immediately take decisive action. (4) The people of some countries have recently been subjected to the rule of totalitarian regimes, which have been imposed upon them by force against their will. A certain country does not hesitate to violate the Yalta Agreement, frequently resorting to coercion and intimidation against certain countries, especially Bulgaria, Romania, and Poland, and the U.S. government has lodged protests against this.

Although President Truman did not directly mention the Soviet Union in his speech, it was undeniably aimed at the Soviet Union. President Truman's issuance of such a strong diplomatic statement was unprecedented since he took office, and no matter how it is interpreted, it is ultimately not a friendly gesture from Moscow's perspective. Therefore, we must ask, why did President Truman dare to deliver this strong diplomatic speech? Is he not afraid of deteriorating U.S.-Soviet relations? Regarding the former, we believe the reason is simple: because President Truman believes that the American people share similar views with him, and they will definitely support his diplomatic policies, so he is fearless. As for the latter, for the sake of world peace and also for the sake of American security, President Truman sincerely hopes to work with the Soviet Union to jointly create world peace; at the same time, he believes that if the four major powers can still maintain the spirit of fighting side-by-side during the war, then the creation of peace will undoubtedly succeed; however, the current turbulent world political situation is ultimately due to the Soviet Union. After the war, the Soviet Union not only has ambitions in Europe, but also has its designs in the Far East; wherever Soviet power extends, there is its "Iron Curtain." Therefore, there are only two options for the U.S. and Britain to deal with the Soviet Union: one is to adopt a policy of appeasement, satisfying the Soviet Union's demands in every way in exchange for Soviet cooperation; the other is to adopt a tough policy, making it wary and preventing it from crossing the line. Considering the failure of British Prime Minister Chamberlain's policy of appeasement towards Germany before the war, it can be seen that President Truman is determined not to repeat the same mistake. According to public opinion in the United States, the majority of the American people do not support adopting a policy of appeasement towards the Soviet Union; moreover, they believe that a policy of appeasement only increases its desires and is harmful rather than beneficial. Conversely, adopting a tough policy, while it may worsen U.S.-Soviet relations, the Soviet Union's foreign policy emphasizes realism and views international relations as a balance of power, so it cannot but take the U.S. warning seriously and reconsider its attitude.

Therefore, we believe that although President Truman's speech is sufficient to become a factor in the deterioration of U.S.-Soviet relations, the only way to make the Soviet Union change its diplomatic style is for the U.S. to adopt this kind of attitude. According to a Moscow dispatch from the Associated Press, after Molotov learned of President Truman's speech, his attitude at the foreign ministers' conference became more moderate; he also made many concessions to the British Foreign Secretary. If this dispatch is true, then it is sufficient to prove that President Truman's choice was very wise.

In conclusion, it is truly unfortunate that the opening of the Moscow conference caused an international uproar. Mankind has longed for peace for a long time, and the expectations for this foreign ministers' conference are even more eager; however, once the conference opened, it caused an international uproar, how can it not grieve us? President Truman has issued a warning, and all peace-loving people should unite to defend world peace and no longer be threatened by any totalitarian regime; at the same time, the Soviet Union should also reconsider and deeply reflect, if it wants the world to maintain peace, it should have a spirit of tolerance in any international conference, focus on the big picture, seek international coordination, and thereby complete the great task of creating world peace. This foreign ministers' conference is truly too important for the safety of the world and the happiness of mankind; we have long said that this international conference can only succeed and cannot fail; and now the key to success or failure is entirely in the hands of the Soviet Union, so we sincerely hope that the Soviet Union will deeply reflect on President Truman's warning and change its attitude! This is not only fortunate for the world, but also fortunate for the Soviet Union!

### Limiting the Continued Expansion of Soviet Power - The U.S. Shifts to a Tougher Diplomacy - Marshall Will Meet Directly with Stalin

[Report from our Office] San Francisco Broadcast, 13th: According to reliable American sources, Marshall has been ordered to adopt a tougher policy towards the Soviet Union at the foreign ministers' conference, and President Truman's address to Congress is clear evidence of this.

[Associated Press] (Moscow, 13th) According to information here, Marshall will soon meet with Stalin to explain the new American policy. However, it has not yet been decided whether Marshall will take the initiative to request a meeting or wait for an invitation from the Kremlin. The Kremlin's banquets for foreign guests also provide an opportunity for talks, or at least for arranging a formal meeting. Everyone is exploring "what impact this may have on the foreign ministers' conference."

[Reuters, London, 12th] President Truman and Foreign Secretary Bevin today issued speeches in Washington and Moscow accusing the Soviet Union of activities in Eastern Europe and Germany, which are the strongest expressions of the U.S. and Britain since the war. Regardless of whether their simultaneous release was a coincidence, their combined effect is to announce to the world that the U.S. and Britain "will not sit idly by." Truman's request to Congress indicates that the U.S. only allows the Soviet Union's sphere of influence to stop at the borders of Greece and Turkey. He further accused the Soviet Union of forcing totalitarian regimes on the Baltic countries within its sphere of influence. Bevin, at the Moscow conference, directly pointed out to Molotov that the Soviet Union had not fulfilled the Potsdam Agreement. What should be noted now is what impact the remarks of the two major leaders of the U.S. and Britain will have on the Moscow conference. London diplomatic observers believe that Truman's speech shows that the U.S. diplomatic policy has become increasingly tough since Marshall took office as Secretary of State, based on three new principles: (1) The U.S. recognizes itself as the world's leading power and will fulfill its responsibilities from now on, no longer relying on other countries such as Britain. (2) The initial method of the U.S. is economic and financial assistance. The President has broadly interpreted aid, so other forms of assistance can also be adopted. (3) The basic policy of the U.S. is to assist free people and oppose 武大 total governance or external pressure.

### Molotov Makes a Demand - International Control of the Ruhr Area - The Four Foreign Ministers Begin Reviewing the Allied Control Council Report

[Report from our Office] London Broadcast, 13th: Molotov convened a preparatory meeting for the four foreign ministers' conference at the Aviation Club at 4 PM (Moscow time).

The first group organized and simplified the Allied Control Council's report on the German problem, the second group organized the report on Austria, and the third group of experts studied the economic problems of the Austrian peace treaty, including the issue of compensation.

[Report from our Office] London Broadcast, 13th: Regarding the issue of speeding up the economic unification of Germany, the U.S. is determined to obtain the Soviet Union's approval. This determination has been secretly warned the Soviet Union at the foreign ministers' conference that if it does not agree, the industrial equipment used as compensation will be reduced.

[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 12th] The Moscow Broadcasting Station recently issued a message stating that the four foreign ministers held their third meeting today and immediately decided to review the important clauses of the report submitted by the Allied Control Council for Germany. According to this report, the meeting of the foreign ministers of the four countries has reviewed and approved it, and it is expected that the foreign ministers' conference will begin reviewing it at the fourth meeting, which will take several weeks. This resolution was proposed by Molotov, and U.S. Secretary of State Marshall and French Foreign Minister Bidault both expressed their approval. Molotov also requested that the Ruhr area be placed under international control, and said that the German problem must not be confused with the German economic unification problem. In addition, it is learned that the Bulgarian government has sent a letter to the foreign ministers' conference, requesting that a Bulgarian delegation be allowed to attend the meeting and report Bulgaria's views on the German peace treaty.

### Bevin's Sharp Rhetoric

The Soviet Union Agrees to Announce the Number of German Prisoners of War

[Associated Press, Moscow, 12th] At today's four-nation foreign ministers' conference, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov first decided to take a defensive position, accepting the request of British Foreign Secretary Bevin to announce the number of German prisoners of war held by the Soviet Union, and admitted that the Soviet Union had not "completely destroyed" the German battleships, but denied that the Soviet Union held three million prisoners of war. He stated that the exact number would be revealed only after all the allied countries had announced it simultaneously. The other three foreign ministers agreed to this. British Foreign Secretary Bevin's speech lasted 45 minutes, and Molotov did not answer all of the requests he made. Bevin also defended the detention of factory equipment in the occupied areas, arguing that Germany must first become economically unified, which is the same as what Marshall expressed yesterday. The various requests made by Bevin in his speech are listed as follows: (1) The allied countries should announce the exact number of German prisoners of war they hold; (2) Announce when they can be allowed to return to their homes; (3) The four countries had previously agreed to destroy the German battleships, but now the Soviet Union has not followed through, and should be asked to explain the reason; (4) The type of industrial equipment that the Soviet Union has removed in the occupied areas should be explained; (5) What is the current production ratio in the Soviet-occupied areas; (6) How much of the German industry in the Soviet-occupied areas has the Soviet Union taken over; (7) The plan for the normal economic standards of Germany after March 1946 set by the Allied countries has been abolished. After Bevin's speech, Marshall also continued to speak, expressing his agreement with all of this.

### The U.S. Trusteeship of the Former Japanese Mandated Islands - Five Countries Will Present Their Views - The Issue is Postponed Until Next Monday for Further Discussion

[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 12th] The United Nations Security Council today unanimously decided to invite India, New Zealand, the Netherlands, Canada and the Philippines to participate in the discussion of the U.S. trusteeship of the former Japanese mandated islands in the Pacific. At the same time, it was decided to postpone the issue until next Monday for further discussion, so that the governments of these countries can notify the Security Council whether they are prepared to attend and present their views. Australian representative Hasluck proposed an amendment stating that the current agreement should be submitted for approval in the Japanese peace treaty. British representative Jebb also proposed an amendment, advocating that preferential treatment for American commerce in the trust territory should be prohibited. At the meeting, Secretary-General Lie submitted for discussion a telegram from New Zealand Prime Minister Fraser on the 13th of this month, requesting permission to participate in the discussion of the former Japanese mandated islands. The Indian liaison officer also sent a letter to the Security Council, requesting that India be invited to participate in the discussion, and requesting that the discussion be postponed so that other non-member countries could also present their views. At this point, U.S. representative Austin said that he would also like to express his agreement to the fact that New Zealand, India and other members of the Far Eastern Commission would send representatives to the meeting to present their views, but the U.S. could not accept the reasons put forward in the New Zealand Prime Minister's letter.

### Japanese People's Desperate Delusion - Hoping to Obtain American Loans

[Associated Press, Tokyo, 13th] According to information obtained by this agency, senior Japanese officials are already discussing that Japan may follow the path suggested by the U.S. for aid to Greece and Turkey, and request a kind of "anti-communist" loan from the U.S. The reporter said, "President Truman's speech indicates that the U.S. will act as the protector of democracy around the world, so if we can prove that if we do not get foreign aid, we will tend towards communism, then we seem to have a very good opportunity to obtain a revival loan." A senior Japanese financial official said that if Congress approves Truman's request, it will inevitably divide the world into two camps, one camp gathered under the U.S. and another camp gathered under the Soviet Union. He also said that Japan had long feared the Soviet Union's power in this part of the world and hoped for American aid. He also strongly stated that Japan would rather be under the American camp.

### Soviet Representatives Arrive in Norway to Continue Boundary Demarcation Negotiations

[Agence France-Presse, Oslo, 12th] Soviet representatives arrived here today, and their mission is to continue the boundary demarcation negotiations that began in Moscow last August.

### Turkey Needs American Aid to Guard Against the Soviet Union

[Associated Press, Ankara, 12th] Qualified government officials declared today: If Turkey wants to maintain its army of one million men in full mobilization to guard against a possible Soviet invasion, it must obtain American aid. For seven years, Turkey has been in a state of full mobilization, with more than 60% of its national income used for military expenditures. Most of its troops are currently stationed along the Turkish-Soviet border east of the Black Sea and the Turkish-Bulgarian border. The huge expenditures have caused a drain on financial resources and have put the entire economic system in danger. The Turkish army is not well-equipped. If Turkey becomes a weak country, it will only invite all kinds of disputes. Therefore, providing aid now is less sacrificial and more far-sighted than trying to save it later.

### U.S.-Philippines Military Agreement to Be Formally Signed Tomorrow

[Central News Agency, Manila, 13th] The four treaties and agreements between the U.S. and the Philippines (including the U.S.-Philippines 99-year military alliance agreement for the U.S. to establish 23 land and sea military bases in the Philippines) are scheduled to be signed on the 15th by U.S. Ambassador to the Philippines McNutt and Philippine Foreign Minister Quirino on behalf of the two governments. The other three agreements are the consular treaty, military aid, and extradition measures. After several months of negotiations, the U.S. finally decided to reduce its military bases in Manila and reduce the total number of military bases in the Philippines from 70 to 23, of which 7 are emergency bases.

### British Government Survives Crisis, Conservative Party's Impeachment Motion Rejected

[United Press, London, 12th] A vote of no confidence in the government, proposed by Conservative Party leader Churchill, was rejected by the House of Commons today by a vote of 374 to 198. The House of Commons then approved the Labor government's economic recovery plan by a vote of 371 to 204. Earlier, Churchill accused the Labor government of "misleading the country and harming the people," and that Labor officials placed the interests of the party above the interests of the government. He also stated that before nationalizing British industries, the Labor Party itself should be nationalized first, placing the nation before the party, and declaring that Labor cabinet members were first and foremost British citizens, and only then considered themselves socialists. Churchill loudly proclaimed, "In less than two years, our country has fallen from a glorious position in the world. The lack of bread should not exist, nor should the coal shortage occur. If the government had foresight and carefully managed affairs, these situations could have been easily prevented. The British people are now all undernourished." Cabinet members responded by shouting "Nonsense!"

### U.S. Adopts New Diplomatic Approach, Key Points of Truman's Speech

The President strongly urged Congress to approve the allocation of $400 million to aid Greece and Turkey and to assist their recovery in other ways, in order to support free nations and resist external coercion... (Full text on page 7 of tomorrow's newspaper)

[United Press, Washington, 12th] President Truman addressed a joint session of Congress today, calling on the American people to use money, materials, and military force to stop the advance of world communism. Although the President did not directly name the Soviet Union, his meaning was very clear. He proposed a new diplomatic policy, specifically requesting Congress to allocate $400 million in aid to Greece and Turkey. Truman also stated that, if necessary, he would not hesitate to request additional funds to assist free nations in maintaining national unity, to prevent aggressors from attempting to impose totalitarian regimes on them. We are now in a position of world leadership, and any hesitation could endanger world peace and undoubtedly endanger our own well-being. The President suggested four points: (1) Approve the allocation of $400 million in aid to Greece and Turkey until June 30, 1948; (2) Authorize the government to send civil servants and military personnel to the two countries to assist in recovery and supervise the use of the funds; (3) Pass legislation authorizing the government to freely use the funds to utilize daily necessities and other supplies and equipment in the most effective manner; (4) Authorize the government to educate and train selected personnel from Greece and Turkey. The last point refers to military training in the United States, similar to the British military advisory group during the last World War. The President's speech was met with cheers from the members of Congress three times. Once when he urged that attention be paid to supervising the use of aid funds, twice when he attacked totalitarian regimes, and once when he said that the situation would become more serious if assistance was not provided. According to Republican Deputy Leader Senator Wileish, this speech was tantamount to a declaration of war against totalitarian forces, but there seemed to be no other way to go.

Washington's Reaction [Reuters, Washington, 12th] The release of Truman's speech comes at a time when diplomatic relations are unusually strained due to the recall of the Soviet ambassadors to Britain and the United States. Although the President did not directly name the Soviet Union, his stern warning that "the current political landscape of the world must not be forcibly changed by coercive political means" was clearly directed at the Soviet Union. The President used the strongest possible language to condemn the Soviet Union for violating the Yalta Agreement and forcing totalitarian regimes on the people of Poland, Romania, and Bulgaria against their will. Veteran observers pointed out that President Roosevelt used similar terms to attack Hitler before the outbreak of World War II. President Truman specifically pointed out that the phenomena of wartime Germany and Japan have reappeared today, and his intention is to classify the Soviet Union's diplomatic policies towards its neighbors in the same category as the policies of Germany and Japan. It is recalled that during the Soviet-Finnish War of 1939-1940, Roosevelt and Churchill used similar phrases to attack the Soviet Union's aggressive policies. The most important point of Truman's speech was the call for Congress to take immediate and decisive legislative action to curb the Soviet Union's aggression and expansionist policies in a specific part of the world. This request is unprecedented in American history. Members of Congress also stated that if Congress approves Truman's request to guarantee the freedom and integrity of Greece and Turkey, its nature will be equivalent to the guarantees given by Britain to Romania and Poland before the outbreak of the Second European War. Truman and Marshall had previously stated clearly in secret meetings with congressional leaders that once the United States accepts its foreign responsibilities, it will never abandon them. In addition to Greece and Turkey, the United States should provide the same guarantees to other countries that are being coerced by Soviet diplomatic policies to force their people to accept pro-Soviet totalitarian regimes.

Congressional Views [United Press, Washington, 12th] The reaction in Congress to President Truman's speech was a mix of praise and criticism. Senator Vandenberg, President of the Senate and Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, stated: "At this time, we must support the President, although there are countless subtle issues to be decided by Congress in detail." Vandenberg also stated that Congress could make a decision by the end of this month, as the President requested. However, American diplomacy should adopt a comprehensive policy, avoid imperialism, sincerely fulfill the Charter of the United Nations, and be suitable for the entire world, so that the same results can be achieved everywhere.

Britain, Greece, and Turkey Welcome [United Press, London, 12th] Regarding President Truman's speech to Congress requesting aid to Greece and Turkey, people in Britain, Greece, and Turkey unanimously expressed their warm welcome tonight. However, a spokesman for the Greek left-wing liberation front expressed dissatisfaction, believing that the United States' move was to replace the "fascist regime" in interfering in Greece's internal affairs and would intensify the Greek civil war.

[United Press, Moscow, 12th] Well-informed sources told a United Press reporter today that the United States has implemented a new policy towards the Soviet Union, which happens to be in effect at the time Secretary of State Marshall is attending the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference. The United States' policy is not intended to disrupt the Moscow conference, but to show the Soviet Union that the United States is taking a new approach. If the Soviet Union is willing to follow this approach in consultations, then the person in charge is currently attending the conference, namely Marshall himself.

Gromyko Silent [Reuters, New York, 13th] United Nations officials do not hide the serious situation caused by President Truman's speech. Soviet representative to the Security Council Gromyko declined to comment, while United Nations officials believe that Truman's speech shows that the United States has recognized the extreme seriousness of the situation, which is already beyond the handling of the United Nations. Polish people feel that the difficult situation in Greece will become more complicated due to Truman's actions, which is most unfortunate. Democratic Senator McCarthy said, "If the United States interferes in Greece and Turkey, it means war," while Republican leader Senator Taft said, "Whether or not interference in Greece will lead to war with the Soviet Union depends on many other circumstances."

Truman in Florida [United Press, Key West, Florida, 12th] President Truman, feeling very tired after delivering an important speech in Congress today, has arrived at this naval base aboard the "Sacred Cow" aircraft for a short rest. The President, who is 62 years old, was instructed by his personal physician, Dr. Graham, to take four days of walks, swimming, and sunbathing to adjust his body and mind in preparation for dealing with the future situation. American foreign policy will face the most severe test in the future. When the President got off the plane, reporters asked if he had received any reports, and the President replied: "No reports at all. I don't know what the reaction is in Moscow or anywhere else."

### Government Officials and Merchants Collude in Corruption and Manipulation of Gold, Lin Fengbao and Yang Anren Arrested, Temporarily Granted Bail to Complete Handover, Departed for the Capital by Night Train Yesterday, Zhan Liansheng to Be Transferred to the District Court Today

[Our Newspaper] The authorities' determination to "fight tigers" in the gold rush case is now a reality. Zhan Liansheng, manager of Tong Feng Yu Gold Store and chairman of the Shanghai Gold Exchange, Lin Fengbao, former director of the Business Bureau of the Central Bank, and Yang Anren, former deputy director of the Business Bureau, took advantage of the Central Bank's distribution and sale of gold, colluding between government officials and merchants to manipulate and engage in corruption. After the supervisory committee filed an impeachment, Chairman Chiang was shocked and angered, and on the evening of the 12th, he telegraphed the Songhu Garrison Headquarters to arrest them and hand them over to the court for handling. Zhan and the other three were arrested at 11 o'clock that night. Because Lin Fengbao and Yang Anren had not yet completed the handover of Central Bank business, Zhang Qun and Zhang Jia'ao, the new president of the Central Bank, met with the Chairman and asked for temporary bail, guaranteeing that they would surrender to the court after the handover was completed. With the Chairman's approval, the adjutant's office notified the garrison headquarters by long-distance telephone on the 13th, and Lin and the other two were temporarily released on bail. It is reported that they have already departed for the capital by train last night with Bei Yitong, the former president of the Central Bank. As for Zhan Liansheng, he will be transferred to the District Court this morning. The garrison headquarters has completed all the procedures yesterday.

### Deputy Commander Yang of the Garrison Headquarters Talks About the Inside Story of Collusion and Manipulation

Deputy Commander Yang of the Garrison Headquarters told reporters yesterday the details of the case, saying: Regarding the facts of collusion and corruption by Lin and others, the following have been verified: First, the quantity of gold secretly sold by the Central Bank daily and the account books of the entrusted sales firms were not true. Taking January 27 of this year as an example, the Central Bank sold 1,820 gold bars to Tong Feng Yu, but Tong Feng Yu's accounts recorded 820 bars. The remaining number was listed on the second or third day, leaving loopholes for speculation and opportunities for manipulation. Second, the original application forms for the Central Bank's gold customers were later abolished, and Zhan Liansheng alone could decide who could purchase gold. Any other firm had to go through Zhan's hands to purchase gold. However, Tong Feng Yu, which was opened by Zhan Liansheng, had a total capital of only 15 million yuan, divided into 15 shares. Zhan obtained two shares, and one share was held on behalf of a friend. The identity of this person and the names of the shareholders of the remaining twelve shares were not revealed. A commercial firm with such a small amount of capital undertook the important task of regulating government finance. From January 23 to February 15 alone, it distributed more than 20,000 gold bars. The facts of collusion are very obvious. Third, on the day before the Central Bank stopped distributing gold, Tong Feng Yu purchased as many as 313 gold bars. Usually, when the price of gold rose, Zhan also used relatives or peripheral organizations to privately transfer gold. There is no doubt that government officials and merchants colluded and manipulated gold. Fourth, the Central Bank's secret sale of gold was also handled by Zhan Liansheng, but there was no record in the account books. Whether the price received by the Central Bank for the secret sale and the price at which Zhan Liansheng resold it were consistent is a major question. If there was no collusion from top to bottom, how could it be so frivolous? Fifth, the accounts of Tai Kang Run Gold Store show that Wang Li from the Central Bank purchased 114 gold bars several days before the price of gold soared. It is clear that Wang Li is a Central Bank employee. According to Xie Bingquan, manager of Tai Kang Run, the purchase from other firms may have been even more than this. The Business Bureau of the Central Bank should be held responsible for selling the gold it had distributed to itself under an assumed name for hoarding. The above-mentioned points are only those that have been verified and cannot be concealed. In addition, the case was sent to the court, and to maintain the confidentiality of the preliminary hearing, it could not be disclosed. In short, the state implemented the gold policy to stabilize prices, but instead, it took advantage of the opportunity and breathed the same air as unscrupulous merchants. It is truly heartbreaking to say. Now that the case has been transferred to the court for trial, there will definitely be a detailed public announcement in the future. Our headquarters has completed its handling of the Lin case.

### More Than a Dozen People on the Blacklist Will Be Arrested

The number of people reached more than a dozen.

### Celebrities and Artists Gather Together, A Variety of Performances Celebrate Tian Han's Birthday

[Our Newspaper] The Shanghai cultural and drama circles held a grand commemorative meeting yesterday afternoon at the Ningbo Fellow Association's Zhengting Hall to celebrate Tian Han's 50th birthday and 30th anniversary of creative work. The guests included more than a thousand people, including well-known figures in the cultural world, university professors, playwrights, writers, female stars, male actors, reporters, and famous opera singers. The conference was presided over by Hong Shen, who is as famous as the birthday celebrant.

### Distribution of Goods in Kind to Begin, Many Agency Rosters Not Yet Submitted

[Our Newspaper] The distribution of goods in kind to public school staff will begin this month, but to date, many agencies have not yet submitted their rosters to the city government. It is understood that the reason for this is that a copy of the organizational regulations must be attached when submitting the rosters, and extra personnel are excluded. However, there are no clear regulations on the organization of the various agencies stationed in Shanghai, so there are many difficulties. Currently, the Materials Supply Review Committee for Public School Staff in this city plans to send a letter to the Executive Yuan to inquire about the quotas for each agency, and will continue to meet on the afternoon of the 15th to discuss relevant matters.

Regarding the distribution of goods in kind to employees this month, Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau said yesterday that various factories and firms can prepare rosters and the quantity needed and submit them to the bureau for purchase starting today. If they do not intend to distribute goods in kind, they can still receive cash for the difference.

### Garbage Is Less Expensive Than Manure

[Our Newspaper] A contract will be put out for bid and is planned to be handled starting in April. Yesterday, Director Zhang told reporters that the estimated revenue from manure this year is 9.3 billion yuan. As for garbage, because it is not as useful as manure for fertilizer and it is difficult to make a profit, it is difficult to find anyone to contract the transportation. The city government once asked Senator Zhou Xiangsheng, a giant in the transportation industry, to be responsible for presiding over the matter, but he declined.

Senator Zhou Xiangsheng Declined with Thanks

### Passenger Planes of Two Companies Approved to Resume Flights the Day After Tomorrow, Registration and Ticket Sales Begin Today, Regular Trial Flights on the China-Siam Route

[Another Report] China Airlines is about to complete the opening of the China-Siam route. The company has scheduled to send a plane to Bangkok on the 19th of this month for a trial flight.

As for the fares on the Siam route, the fare per passenger from Shanghai to Saigon is 892,000 yuan in national currency, and to Bangkok it is 965,000 yuan in national currency. From Saigon to Shanghai it is 266 US dollars, and from Bangkok to Shanghai it is 288 US dollars.

### Preliminary Hearing of the Embezzlement Case at the CUSA Zhenru Factory, None of the Defendants Plead Guilty, Australian Deputy Director Chi Zhi Even Claimed He Could Not Answer Questions Without CUSA's Notification

[Our Newspaper] The embezzlement case at the CUSA Zhenru Machine Factory had its preliminary hearing in the District Court yesterday. The defendant, Australian Deputy Director Chi Zhi, evasively denied the crimes of colluding with the Polish Factory Affairs Director Xie Beiluo to steal and sell 55 boxes of plywood and 10 boxes of aluminum sheets. He claimed that he could not answer questions without CUSA's notification, but said that the stolen money he received was a gift from others. The other defendants, Xie Beiluo, Yang Shenghuan, Li Luoshi, Ma Shiyi, Qian Zhengfu, and Cao Chiming, also tried to evade guilt, either shirking responsibility by claiming they were not in charge, or claiming they had not participated. Many of the confessions they made in the investigation court of the District Prosecutor's Office were not even admitted. The court will summon witnesses for confrontation and will reschedule the hearing for another day.

### "Government-Run Commercial Firms" Are Widely Criticized, Large Quantities of Luxury Goods Imported Worth Hundreds of Thousands of US Dollars, and It Is Rumored That They Were Ordered by Government Agency Personnel

[United Press, Local Report] State-owned commercial firms have recently purchased imported goods worth hundreds of thousands of US dollars, and are not subject to the exchange restrictions and import regulations that private Chinese and American commercial firms have been subject to since last November. It is understood that Yitong Company, the Central Trust Bureau, and the China Supply Bureau are currently importing large quantities of "luxury goods," such as high-priced cars, wireless radios, refrigerators, and other goods that the Chinese authorities have strictly prohibited from importing, while thousands of import permits and exchange requests from private commercial firms for urgently needed legal imports, such as heavy industrial equipment, are being ignored by the authorities. Shipping industry sources also confirmed that most of these luxury goods were ordered by government-related commercial firms for private customers, and it is rumored that they were ordered by government agency personnel to make profits for personal gain.

Chinese business people pointed out that Yitong Company is an agent of the Central Trust Bureau, ordering foreign goods at low prices and charging a commission of 2.5% when reselling them to private commercial firms and 1% when selling them to the government. As a result, Chinese and American commercial firms make very little profit and cannot cover their expenses, making it difficult for them to compete with "government-run" commercial firms. Chinese and American merchants are also highly critical of the fact that Song Zi'an's Fuzhong Company, Song Zi'an's China Construction Bank Company, and Kong Lingkan's Yangzi Construction Company can all use "special privileges" to engage in business. For example, one of Fuzhong Company's representatives is currently traveling on business in the United States using a Chinese diplomat's passport, while experienced Chinese business leaders who want to go to the United States are often not allowed to do so. Recently, American commercial firms in Washington and New York have protested to the State Department about the above-mentioned "privileged" commercial firms, accusing them of using political and other pressure to exclude foreign merchants from China. Although most American business leaders in China are unwilling to discuss the matter publicly, most also acknowledge that the protests filed a month ago still exist, and believe that there is very little hope of improvement.

### Closing Arguments Concluded in Case of American Sailor Stabbing Rickshaw Puller; Verdict to be Announced Tomorrow

[Report from Our Newspaper] The court hearing for the case of the American sailor stabbing a rickshaw puller was held yesterday morning. Legal advisors specially dispatched by UNRRA and the American Consulate in Shanghai were in court to listen in. The victim, Cheng Rongfang, was still recovering from his injuries and was represented by his brother, Cheng Rongquan. After briefly questioning the defendant, Rogers, the presiding judge began the arguments. Prosecutor Huang Daping stood up and stated that the defendant had admitted to all details of the assault, and that the defendant's claim of self-defense was not credible. The victim was severely injured at the time, so he was charged under the second paragraph of Article 277 of the Criminal Law. However, Cheng Rongfang's condition has gradually improved, and he is expected to recover, so the court is requested to change the charging article as necessary. The defendant's defense attorney requested that the court allow the victim to withdraw the charges, stating that the victim and his brother had both agreed to withdraw the charges, and that a recording of their conversation could prove this. Cheng Rongquan stated that he had no grudges against the defendant, but asked the court to handle the matter according to the law. However, the victim's lawyer pointed out that the victim's previous written withdrawal of the charges was a planned fraudulent act by the defendant's attorneys. After the arguments were concluded, the court announced the end of the trial, and set the verdict for the 15th.

### Two Health Bureau Employees Accused of Robbery

Released on Bail and Immediately Suspended

[Report from Our Newspaper] Yesterday, a newspaper reported that a Health Bureau staff member robbed a bidding merchant. According to Health Bureau Director Zhang Wei yesterday, the facts were quite different. A reporter named Liu Chunji had previously contracted with the Health Bureau to manufacture manure trucks and garbage trucks, and a contract had been signed. However, due to rising prices, he was unable to deliver the goods on time. According to the contract, a penalty was calculated for the delay in delivery, totaling more than 10 million yuan. Later, considering the merchant's difficulties, the bureau, together with the accounting and auditing departments, reduced the amount to more than 3 million yuan. On the 12th, Liu Chunji went to the City Bank to collect part of the payment. The Health Bureau, fearing that he would not pay the fine, sent two employees, Zhu Kai and Chen Bozi, to follow him. After Liu received the money, the two immediately collected the fine from him. As Liu walked out of the City Bank, he threw the remaining money in his hand on the ground and shouted "robbery," accusing Zhu and Chen of robbery. The police brought them to the police station. That evening, the Health Bureau telegraphed Director Zhang to request that the two be released on bail. Director Zhang, not wanting to believe one side of the story, did not approve the request. After inquiring about the details yesterday morning, Zhu and Chen were released on bail. Yesterday, Director Zhang issued an order to suspend the two. If the dereliction of duty is confirmed, they will be handed over to the court for investigation. If they have been falsely accused, they will be reinstated. In the meantime, the court is requested to charge Liu with false accusation. It is reported that Liu Chunji called out "robbery" because he was frustrated by the loss. Negotiations for a settlement are now underway.

[Report from Our Newspaper] Wu Daoyi, a 48-year-old from Beijing, was originally a first-class assistant to the Inspector General of Customs at the Jianghai Customs. After the enemy took over the concessions, he continued to work at the customs. In the 32nd year of the Republic of China, he was assigned by the puppet Customs Administration to serve as the head of the tax section of the Weihaiwei Customs, and was soon promoted to head of the Weihaiwei Customs.

During the enemy-puppet period, Zhang served as an inspector of the Puppet Anhui Province Opium Prohibition Committee, the chief of the Propaganda Section of the Puppet Shanghai Municipal Government, and the captain of the Puppet Shanghai Garrison Headquarters. Zhang Pei stated in court that he had only served as a clerk in the Propaganda Section of the Puppet Shanghai Municipal Government and had not held the puppet positions of section chief or captain.

After the hearing, it was announced that the arguments were concluded and that the verdict would be announced on the morning of the 20th.

### Basketball Star Lu Zhong'en's Eyewitness Account of the Taiwan Uprising: The Leading Thugs Were Taiwanese Vagrants Repatriated from Taiwan Province, Attacking Public Institutions and Destroying Stores and Residences

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Zhongxing ship arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday, carrying more than 200 Taiwanese civil servants and their families, including the basketball star Lu Jian'en. Lu went to Taipei last May for business. Having personally experienced the major uprising, he told reporters yesterday that he believes that whether the Japanese are secretly involved in this incident is worth considering, because the leading thugs are all Taiwanese vagrants repatriated from Shanghai, Tokyo, Hainan Island, and other places.

Lu described the uprising as follows: The incident occurred at the intersection of Yanging Road and Desheng Street in Taipei, which is a gathering place for open black market vendors. On the evening of February 27th, officials and police from the Monopoly Bureau arrested vendors. In the chaos, a female vendor was injured. People gathered and surrounded the police. The police fired blank shots, but the crowd did not disperse, resulting in one person being shot dead. The crowd surged to the police station and the cold-blooded troops, demanding that the perpetrators be severely punished. That night, the military and police officials agreed to punish the perpetrators, and the crowd dispersed. However, the next morning, they swarmed to the police station again, demanding that the perpetrators be handed over. When their demands were not met, they launched a march, attacking the Monopoly Bureau, burning goods and furniture, and rushing to the Governor's Office. The guards first fired blank shots, but the crowd did not disperse, resulting in a conflict in which several people were shot dead, and the situation escalated further. Taiwanese attacked public institutions everywhere, beat foreigners, and destroyed shops and residences of foreigners.

When the crowd gathered at the train station, the magistrate of Hsinchu County happened to arrive by train on official business. He was not aware of the incident and took out his business card to persuade the crowd to disperse. Unexpectedly, the crowd saw the business card and immediately attacked him with fists and feet, causing him serious injuries. The Taiwanese would ask anyone who looked like a person from another province, "Where are you from? What do you do?" If they could not answer in Taiwanese, they would be beaten. In the first day of the riot, they were empty-handed, but later they used knives and guns, and even children participated.

The riot subsided somewhat on the fourth day, and Lu left Taiwan on that day. He did not witness the more serious situation on the fifth day. He believes that the measures taken by the Taiwan Provincial authorities are beneficial to the Taiwanese. It is said that "those who come from this country to Taiwan to do business mostly lose money."

### Young Robbers Show Filial Piety; Voluntarily Surrender, Asking for Parents' Release

[Report from Our Newspaper] At 2:30 p.m. on the 11th, three robbers suddenly arrived at the residence of Zhou Shen Wenban at No. 83, Lane 273, Jiaozhou Road. All were dressed in Western suits, and upon entering the door, they took out guns and bound Zhou Shen Wenban, his elderly mother, and another maid, four people in total, into a small room, guarded by one robber. The remaining robbers went upstairs, looted for about an hour, and then left through the back door. The total value of the watches and jewelry stolen was estimated at several million. Afterwards, the victim rushed to the Jiangning Branch to report the incident. That night, it was discovered that Sun Leshan, a member of the action team of a certain bureau's studio, also known as Sun Wei or Xiao Mao, was highly suspected. He was arrested and interrogated the next morning, and admitted that he had conspired with Ding Fuliang and Cai Delin to rob. The day before yesterday, Ding Fuliang was arrested in front of the Weida Dance Hall, and the parents of the fugitive Cai Delin, and Han Zhijie, who had acted as a guarantor for Cai in a previous police case, as well as his acquaintance, the dancer Ye Zi, were all summoned for questioning about Cai's whereabouts. Until about 2:00 a.m. the next day, Cai changed into blue worker's clothes, came to the station to turn himself in, and asked that his parents be released.

### Social Services

(1) Deposit Issue

I deposited 1,600 legal tender yuan into the bank on August 16th of the 30th year of the Republic of China, for a one-year term, with a stated weekly interest rate of 8%. By the time it matured, I had returned to my hometown. Now I have several questions: (1) If I want to withdraw the money now, should it be calculated according to the exchange rate of the puppet reserve certificates at that time (two legal tender yuan for one puppet currency yuan)? (2) Can the money be returned according to the Civil Code (1,000 times) or other appropriate ratio? (3) If the bank is unwilling to return the money, can I sue according to the law? (4) What are the procedures for filing a lawsuit?

[Lawyer Duanmu Kai's Answer] You can file a lawsuit with the court to request an increased payment ruling in accordance with Article 12 of the Supplementary Regulations for Handling Civil Litigation After the Restoration.

(2) Overstepping Authority

Zhou Yongliang asked: (1) Is an engagement made by parents on behalf of their children without the children's consent valid? (2) Does this engagement have any legal binding force on the children? (3) Can the betrothal gifts given at the time of the engagement be recovered upon dissolution of the engagement? (4) Does this engagement without the children's consent need to be dissolved through legal procedures? (5) Is compensation for the other party's losses required upon dissolution? (6) If the person refuses to attend the wedding, is it illegal, and what responsibilities do both parents have?

[Lawyer Duanmu Kai's Answer] 1. An engagement should be made by the man and woman themselves. This is clearly stipulated in Article 972 of the Civil Code, so an engagement made by parents on behalf of their children is legally invalid. 2. If there is no explicit consent, it is not binding. 3. It can be returned. 4. It is invalid from the beginning and does not require dissolution procedures. 5. Those who are not at fault for the dissolution are not liable for damages. 6.

Fire at Seymour Road: Indictment for Neglect of Duty Twenty-three Firefighters and Police Officers Charged with Two Counts

[Our Newspaper] The prosecution of firefighters and police officers for neglect of duty in the Seymour Road fire case has been concluded by Prosecutor Shen of the District Prosecutor's Office, and two separate indictments have been filed. Shang Zhikui, Dai Guangrong, Li Chengjun, and Cai Zhiying (all in custody) are charged with robbery for allegedly entering No. 27 and stealing towels, handkerchiefs, and other items while embers were still smoldering. Huang Baoqi (in custody), Li Xun, Zhu Qinglan, Zhou Yueshi, Liu Jihan, Zhao Rongjiang, Huang Keqin, Wang Zhenshan, Yang Abao, Tong Zunwu, Wang Songqing, Tang Changsheng, Liu Lianbi, Yang Yingshan, Luo Qing, Gu Genfu, Wang Zhongxiu, Wang Fengan, and Li Ashan are charged with endangering public safety and theft. The facts, reasons, and applicable laws of the two indictments are as follows: (1) Defendant Shang Zhikui was the squad leader of the Yichang Road fire station, Dai Guangrong was a firefighter at Station No. 11 in the same district, Li Chengjun was a firefighter at Station No. 108, and Cai Zhiying was a firefighter at Station No. 587. On January 22 of this year, at 9:30 PM, a fire broke out at the copper shop at 452 Wuding Road, spreading to the entire Lane 660. By 11:00 AM the next morning, embers were still smoldering. The fire station dispatched Shang Zhikui to lead Dai Guangrong and the other two to guard the fire scene. The four took the opportunity to enter the home of Zhou Xiuzhen at No. 27 in the lane, steal property, and force Zhou Qifang to open the lock on a chest, allowing them to plunder it. Prosecutor Shen believes that Zhou Qifang was forced at the time due to the overwhelming force and the disparity in numbers, reaching a level of irresistible coercion. Referring to the precedent set by the Supreme Court's decision No. 262 of the third year of the Republic of China, Shang Zhikui and the other four defendants are undoubtedly in continuous violation of Article 134, Paragraph 1, and Article 321, Paragraph 1, Item 5 of the Criminal Code, and the Ordinance for the Punishment of Banditry. In accordance with Article 1, Paragraph 1, Item 2 of the Special Criminal Cases Litigation Ordinance, and Article 230, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law, a public prosecution is initiated. (2) Defendant Huang Baoqi was the captain of the Jing'an Temple fire brigade, and Li Xun was the district captain of the Xinzha district. When the fire spread, they led the Jing'an Temple district's Fire Engine No. 30 to the scene. At that time, the Wang family's Western-style house at No. 29 had not yet been affected. Huang Baoqi and Li Xun, with ulterior motives, did not put out the fire. Before the house caught fire, they borrowed a daylight lamp from the Wang family's servant, and searched upstairs and downstairs for valuable items. Half an hour later, a fire broke out on the third floor of the Wang family's house, causing eight Western-style houses in the entire lane to be destroyed. District detachment members Zhu Qing, Zhou Yueshi, and firefighters Liu Jihan, Zhao Rongjiang, Huang Keqin, Wang Zhenshan, Yang Abao, Tong Zunwu, Wang Songqing, Tang Changsheng, Liu Lianbi, Yang Yingshan, Luo Qing, and Gu Genfu took the opportunity to enter No. 29 and steal property. Detachment member Wang Zhongxiu, and firefighters Wang Fengan and Li Ashan, entered No. 27 and stole property. The above-mentioned facts of the crimes are all proven by various victims and witnesses. As Li Xun was the commanding officer, and Huang Baoqi was responsible for putting out the fire at No. 29, yet both intentionally failed to do so, allowing the fire to burn, this passive behavior is equivalent to active arson, and they should be held responsible for the crime of arson. The defendants Zhu Qinglan, Wang Zhongxiu, and the other seventeen had entered No. 29 or No. 27, and valuables were stolen from both locations. Since the defendants had entered these places, they are suspected of violating Article 28, Article 321, Paragraph 1, Item 5 of the Criminal Code. The defendant Li Xun is suspected of violating Article 15 and Article 173, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Code, and Huang Baoqi is suspected of violating Article 15, Article 173, Paragraph 1, Article 38, and Article 321, Paragraph 1, Item 5 of the Criminal Code, and shall be punished in accordance with Article 55 of the same law. Because all the defendants are civil servants who committed crimes by taking advantage of their official positions, they should be given a heavier sentence in accordance with Article 134, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Code. In accordance with Article 230, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law, a public prosecution is initiated.

### China-England Friendly Football Match Donghua vs. English Navy Clash at Yiyuan This Afternoon at 4:00 PM

Under the sponsorship of the Sports Association Committee, the China-England friendly football match will be held this afternoon at 4:00 PM at the Yiyuan Stadium, with Donghua, the winning team of this year's Group A League, facing a mixed team of the English Navy organized by the British ships HMS Belfast, Cossack, Guardian, and Comet, which recently came to Shanghai for sightseeing. Tickets are priced at 3,000 and 5,000, and will be sold at the Municipal Sports Association Hall starting at 2:00 PM this afternoon. The referee is Shen Huichun, and the linesmen are He Chunhui and Chen Jixiang. The lineups for both sides today are announced below.

The English Navy lineup, according to Ensign S. Graham of HMS Belfast, said yesterday: "The English Navy attaches great importance to today's friendly match with Donghua. Therefore, when we had a practice match with the Jewish team in the middle of last week, we carefully selected the elite. However, after the practice match with the Soviet team a few days ago, we found that the coordination of the mixed team was still loose. Therefore, it was decided today that the HMS Belfast team will fight alone in order to obtain familiar coordination and cooperation." The team's goalkeeper Novice is relatively weak, but the team's style is tough and full of energy. The central player, Spies, is the soul of the team, and the Donghua players should be careful.

The Donghua team's battle line was quite difficult to arrange due to Li Yao's departure from Shanghai a few days ago. It was not until 6:30 PM last night that it was announced by Mai Youliang. It is possible that Li Yao will rush back to participate in the battle today. In addition to the original lineup remaining unchanged, the veterans Dai Linjing, Liang Shutang, and Li Ning have also decided to take up the role again. Therefore, the Donghua team's military appearance will be more complete today.

### Stray Notes from the Sideline

In yesterday evening's basketball league game, Shen Yi Group Chunmao lost to Shantou team, which was expected, but the crushing defeat by as many as nine points was also due to reasons: At the start of the game, Fu Shan and Tian Lie were not on the court. Chunmao's forwards lacked scoring talent, relying instead on the two guards, Xianzheng and Fuqiang, for points.

Shantou team's He Lide and Cai Yanxiong formed a good partnership. Cai passed into the open space under the basket, and He sprinted to receive the ball, turned around, and shot. He's jumping ability was excellent, and Chunmao could not stop him. In addition, Chen Qingjiang's shooting was smooth, reaching his personal best standard.

Shantou team and Chunmao were long-time rivals, aware of each other's weaknesses. When the score was 13-5, Fu Shan, carrying an injury, entered the game, but his performance was diminished. He was also tightly guarded by Cai Yanxiong, unable to perform. It was not until Shantou team took a commanding lead of 38-18 that Fu Shan scored his first basket.

In the second half, Chunmao's Zheng Jiabiao held up the remaining game, making several corner passes, otherwise the situation would have been even more unthinkable.

In another game, Ren Yu vs. Hai Lu Qing, it was temporarily changed to a friendly match between Ren Yu and Columbus. With an early lead, Ren Yu won against Columbus by one point.

The aim of this game was to exchange skills. Ren Yu no longer had the psychological tension. Everyone maintained their usual level. The whole team played together, with clear offensive routes: finding open spaces, positioning well, ball arriving at the person, skillful cooperation, short passes, stable, beautiful and clear. Compared with the game against Hualian, it was like two different teams.

Columbus is a team with strong defense, but in the second half, Ren Yu penetrated their defenses as if there was no one there. In yesterday's game, Ren Yu's shots were still too hasty and wasteful. (Chang Nian)

### The Four Joint Offices Raised the Approved Limit for Loan Applications That Departments and Bureaus File After the Fact from 50 Million Yuan to 200 Million Yuan

[United Press Nanjing, 13th Dispatch] The post of Chairman of the Four Joint Offices has recently been assigned to be temporarily held by the Minister of Finance, Yu Hongjun. According to the organization's constitution, the current Governor of the Central Bank, Zhang Jia'ao, and Deputy Governor, Liu Gongyun, both serve as Directors of the Offices. This morning, at the Executive Yuan meeting, the 339th board meeting was held. In addition to all the original directors attending, Director Zhang Jia'ao, Director Liu Gongyun, as well as the newly appointed Director of the Central Trust Bureau, Wu Rencang, and Director of the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau, Gu Chunfan, also attended and participated. The meeting was presided over by Deputy Yu, and in addition to passing more than 30 important cases, the handling procedures for loan cases were discussed in detail. Previously, in order to accelerate the handling of loan cases, strive for timeliness, and specify the responsibilities at each stage of the handling process, the Offices formulated a set of measures for the handling and processing of loan cases. Since the implementation of these measures, they have been effective in achieving speed and accuracy. However, as half a year has passed, there are inevitably aspects that need to be supplemented and revised. After the directors expressed their opinions, the key points of revision were decided as follows:

(1) The original measures stipulated that departments and bureaus could file loan applications after they had been processed, with a limit of 50 million yuan. Due to changing circumstances, it is proposed to raise this limit to 200 million yuan. Loan applications below 200 million yuan can be filed after they have been processed. Those above 200 million yuan must be approved by the general office before they can be undertaken. For the Northeast region, the limit is changed to 20 million yuan in circulating currency.

(2) For loan cases that are urgent or handled routinely, if the amount exceeds 200 million yuan, the needs of the borrower should be considered, and a request should be submitted to the Chairman or Deputy Chairman for instructions on how to proceed.

(3) In the future, the loan business of various departments and bureaus should be conducted in coordination with the economic emergency measures plan at any time. They should be responsible for auditing the use of loans by various loan projects. Lin Fengbao, Chairman of the Loan Subcommittee of the Offices, has resigned, and Liu Gongyun has been appointed to take over. He presided over the loan meeting at the general office meeting this afternoon.

### Rumor Has It That Yarn Market Will Reinstate Price Controls: Yarn Factories and Merchants Began to Enter the Market to Buy and Sell Yesterday

In order to implement the economic emergency measures plan, the authorities are preparing to reinstate price controls on cotton yarn. According to sources, the Ministry of Economic Affairs will approve the standard price limit set by the Textile Control Conference. In the future, all market transactions and yarn factory sales must not exceed this price. This new price limit may be slightly higher than the current purchase price. The authorities are already considering this measure. Once it is officially implemented, manufacturers who violate the price controls will be severely punished. Also reported, the cotton yarn group of the Songhu Garrison Command's Economic Investigation Network, after deciding with the Yarn Trade Association to ban over-the-counter transactions, will have the association handle the registration of yarn factories and customer merchants, issue market entry permits. Starting yesterday, new members have begun to participate in market transactions. In total, 883 units have participated in the market, including 284 yarn factories, more than 30 merchants, and the rest are yarn firms.

### Rebound in the Yarn Market

The yarn market rebounded yesterday. In the early morning, it continued the weakness of the previous day. The opening price was 50,000 to 60,000 yuan lower than the previous day's closing price. Soon, Tianjin merchants purchased 32-count and 40-count single yarns for the Red Leader Star and Heavenly Maiden brand cloth factories. The decline stopped immediately, and the situation improved. Prices then rose slowly. Light-weight Shuangma initially traded at 3.12 million, which was actually 80,000 yuan lower than the 3.2 million listed by the Textile Construction Company the previous day. Then, speculative funds took the opportunity to absorb at a low price, and the closing price was 3.3 million. All other yarn counts generally improved by more than 100,000 yuan. 40-count single yarn was particularly scarce, and the price even surpassed 42-count double-strand yarn.

### Foreign Exchange Affects Coal Cost: Mine Operators Hope to Adjust Prices – Government to Subsidize Distribution Losses –

[Reported by this newspaper] According to a certain person in charge of the Fuel Management Committee, the source of coal in this city is still mainly from Kaifeng. A small amount is also shipped from the northeast. The supply from the Jiaoji Railway and Zhongxing Coal Mines is still uncertain. Currently, no coal is being shipped from Taiwan. Currently, 30% to 40% of the production cost of each coal mine requires foreign exchange. Recently, the foreign exchange rate has been adjusted, increasing by 260%. Therefore, the mine operators hope to adjust and increase the price of coal production by 140% to 160%. As the implementation of economic emergency measures has just begun, it is difficult to adjust prices. However, it is estimated that the production cost of each mine operator must increase by at least 100% in order to barely maintain production. The government has now decided that the distribution price of coal sold to public utilities and transportation businesses will remain the same. However, the economic cost of the miners that is lost will be subsidized by the Ministry of Economic Affairs. The distribution price of coal to industrial and commercial enterprises is still subject to approval by the Ministry of Economic Affairs. After the government adopts the subsidy policy, the actual price that the miners receive will not necessarily cover the cost. However, the government sincerely hopes that the mine operators will strive to conserve the use of equipment and materials, maintain the original coal source, and temporarily refrain from deepening development.

Also, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company currently charges 27,500 yuan per ton for transporting coal from Qinhuangdao to Shanghai on behalf of the Fuel Management Committee, which results in significant losses. In addition, the freight charges for railways that transport coal are also insufficient to cover costs. It has been decided that freight charges will remain unchanged, but 70% of the losses will be subsidized by the Ministry of Transportation. The freight cost for foreign ships to transport coal is still US$6.35 per ton and will not be adjusted. terms. (2) Flying flower sold to the Flying Flower Industry Association must be sold to the members. The association must not engage in its own operations. (3) The purchase of cutting knives, silk, and No. 1 broken seeds for re-production (i.e., making 10-count and 5-count cotton yarns) should be handled in accordance with the first agreement.

### Fine Cloth Slightly Rebounds

Yesterday's cotton cloth market saw fine cloth merchants taking advantage of low prices to absorb, and prices rose slightly. Subsequently, the Textile Construction Company supplied white cloth, and the allocated price of Blue Chicken fine cloth was 140,500 yuan, which was relatively loose. Speculators sold at high prices, and the market was flooded with goods, causing prices to fall at one point. However, due to the strong appetite of the customer, the final price of 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth was 154,000 yuan, an increase of 4,500 yuan from the previous day. Five Blessings fine cloth was 151,000 yuan, also an increase of 4,000 yuan. Other brands rose by varying amounts of 2,000 to 4,000 yuan. Dyed cloth, raw cloth, and Shilin cloth sold well. Prices fell from 3,000 to 4,000 yuan to 10,000 yuan, while other goods saw mixed gains and losses.

### Rubber Industry Hopes for Eased Import Exchange Settlement and Increased Tariffs for Protection

[Reported by this newspaper] According to a survey by the Industrial and Commercial Guidance Office, there are a total of 73 rubber factories in this city, with 342 mixing machines, requiring a total of 1,739.5 tons of rubber per month. There are 40 factories in Tianjin, with 80 existing mixing machines, requiring 270 tons per month. There are also eight factories taken over by the government, requiring 210 tons per month. There are nine factories in Chongqing, with 28 existing mixing machines (excluding Pu Li), requiring 68 tons per month. There are eight factories in Qingdao and Taiwan, requiring 470 tons per month, and about 120 tons are unknown. Shenyang requires 200 tons per month, and Guangzhou requires 450 tons per month. Therefore, all places outside of Shanghai require a total of 1,788 tons. The national demand for raw rubber is 3,527.5 tons per month. The industry has been prosperous in the past. Currently, problems have arisen in the procurement of raw materials, and a crisis is lurking. The supply of raw rubber in our country was originally controlled by the four countries of Britain, the United States, France, and the Netherlands for export. This control was lifted starting this year. However, since the restriction on imported goods, those holding goods have taken advantage of the situation, and the price per pound has increased from 1,000 yuan to 10,000 yuan within a month, making it difficult to purchase. Currently, because a portion of raw rubber can be settled with foreign exchange, the price has fallen back to 5,000 to 6,000 yuan. In order to maintain the production of domestic rubber products, it seems that the settlement of imports of rubber with foreign exchange should be eased. As for the large amount of precipitated calcium carbonate needed by the rubber industry every month, there are five domestic calcium carbonate factories that can produce it. However, the current product supply cannot meet the demand. If investment is increased and development is strengthened, it may be possible to achieve self-sufficiency. It has also been found that American car tires mostly use synthetic rubber, and their effectiveness is only 40% that of natural rubber. Therefore, domestic rubber products are better than imported products. It is now heard that British Freedom bicycle tires with 50,000 to 60,000 pairs in stock will be devalued and dumped in Shanghai. Therefore, the industry hopes that the authorities can increase tariffs to protect them.

### Firewood and Charcoal Arrive in Abundance, Prices Fall

Due to excessively high asking prices, the market for bituminous coal fines was sluggish and transactions were infrequent. The market for bituminous coal lumps was relatively firm due to the limited supply of goods. The arrival of white coal lumps from Jiaozuo suddenly increased, and the market price gradually declined. Due to the abundant supply of firewood and charcoal, buyers were cautious, and the market continued to decline.

### Rice Market Unchanged, Soybean Oil Continues to Fall by 10,000 Yuan

Yesterday, the north and south markets received about 12,000 shi of rice and grains. The market was weak in the morning and firm in the afternoon. The results were similar to the previous day. There was little difference in the price of both japonica and indica rice, but there was still ample stock of river-accumulated rice, so the prospect of prosperity is uncertain.

Wheat flour tended to be firm in the inland, rising by 1,000 yuan, wheat bran remained in a depressed state, falling by another 1,000 yuan. The oil market continued to decline, with raw oil falling by 6,000 to 7,000 yuan. Soybean oil, sesame oil, and peanut oil all continued to fall by 10,000 yuan. The digestion of soybean cake remained weak, the market atmosphere was lackluster, and it continued to decline by a small amount of just over 1,000 yuan.

The arrival of soybeans was still continuous, with northeast soybeans strengthening, and Hankou mung beans and broad beans showing a declining trend. The state of black beans was downward, red sorghum fell again by 1,000 yuan, wheat was stable, and cowpeas were stable. Raw peanuts arrived and were digested equally, and the market was stable, sesame was stable. Red beans were weak, falling by 1,000 yuan, and broad beans were flat.

### Diesel and Cotton Shipped to Shanghai

[Reported by this newspaper] The Victory, a foreign affairs department ship managed by Jardine Matheson, arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday, carrying more than 2,000 tons of goods from San Francisco, with more than 2,000 barrels of diesel as the main cargo, followed by 600 bales of cotton, and the rest were miscellaneous goods. Also, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Linsen ship sailed to Guangdong yesterday, carrying 6,100+ bags of raw peanuts, 1,000+ bags of beans, 3,900 blocks of soybean cake, 190+ pieces of piece goods, and 70 pieces of cotton yarn.

### Sellers Dump Goods for Cash, Keemun Black Tea Trading Commences

Due to the stubborn attitudes of both buyers and sellers, there has been a lack of formal transactions in Keemun black tea, which is in demand by British merchants, for days. After the market opened yesterday morning, general financial regulators rushed to sell, and buyers took the opportunity to suppress prices. As a result, although trading began, the market atmosphere frequently revealed weakness, and prices plummeted. Other export green teas, apart from old and inferior goods that have been in storage for many years, are currently difficult to sell. The variety from 1945 and 1946 are still being sought, but the offered price is tight, resulting in unconcluded agreements and little fluctuation. Domestic red-edged tea is still within a narrow range, and the market remains stable.

### Rayon Sales Dull

Although the allocation of rayon has been reduced, sales were dull, so the market fell by another 100,000 yuan yesterday. Gaoshan Yukari, No. 120 opened at 6.65 million yuan, and closed at 6 million yuan. The afternoon was similar. Asahi Yukari was priced at 5 million to 5.5 million yuan, and someone sold. The result was little trading. Factory agents set a firm price, and there were no transactions from retailers. Brokers had a small absorption at low prices. Foreign firm telegraph quoted grade C at 7.8 million yuan. The price of silk remained unchanged, but trading was minimal. Lin Ji gauze and Hua Jin crepe, etc., were reduced by one to two hundred yuan due to the drop in raw material prices.

### Casing Prices Plunge, Shanghai Bristles Rise Again

[Reported by this newspaper] The casing market situation yesterday saw prices frequently reported to plunge. The price per barrel fell from 7.2 million yuan to 6.5 million yuan, and the price per fresh intestine fell from 2,400 yuan to 2,000 yuan. Wool was traded slightly. The purchase price of spot Huzhou wool was 110,000 yuan per sima dan, which is about double the price at the end of last year. There was no goods nor a market for Shandong wool. Shanghai bristles were tight in the foreign markets, and the market rose from 3 million yuan to 3.1 million yuan yesterday.

### Soap Sales Sluggish, Prices Fall

[Reported by this newspaper] Recently, as soap sales have been slack and retail sales have been slow, factories have frequently dispatched goods. Although the factory prices of goods dispatched to various distributors are high, some factories have stipulated that those who do not accept dispatched goods will have their distribution qualifications revoked. Therefore, they can only reluctantly accept them, resulting in a daily increase in the number of chips on the market. Although the prices of various brands of soap have not fallen below the factory price, they are on par with the factory price. It was rumored that Xiang Mao had decided to open distribution and that the factory price would be lowered to 90,000 yuan, causing those holding goods to want to compete to sell them.

### American Gold Sold in Canada for $41.50 per Ounce

[Reuters, New York, December 12] The export gold price remains between $42 and $42.80 per ounce, New York delivery alongside the ship. It is learned that 29,000 ounces of American gold stored in Canada is being sold in Canada, Ottawa delivery alongside the ship, including export permits, for $41.50 per ounce.

### Tianjin Stock Exchange Prepares to Open, Government Shares May Also Join

The Tianjin Stock Exchange is actively preparing for reopening since receiving the order, and it will soon be able to resume business. It is learned that there are more shares subscribed by the financial sector. Whether government shares will join is still under consideration by the authorities. However, according to those familiar with the inside, the addition of government shares is almost certain, and only the method of joining needs to be considered.

### Cigarette Prices to Be Adjusted: Manufacturers Hope for Fair Valuation at Market Prices

[Reported by this newspaper] According to a person in charge of the Cigarette Industry Association, the valuation of cigarette commodity tax rates will be considered for adjustment due to recent changes in cigarette market prices. It is heard that the tax rate per case for the lowest grade cigarettes will be adjusted from the original 125,000 yuan to 150,000 yuan. Other grades of cigarettes will be adjusted according to their respective situations. The general adjustment rate is about 20%. The industry sincerely hopes that this valuation adjustment should be fairly determined based on the current market prices of various brands of cigarettes. A list of the current market prices of various brands of cigarettes and their applicable tax rates is provided below:

### Diagnosis Fees and Physician Status

— Fan Shouyuan

Society is just that kind of society: those who can increase their own reputation can elevate their own status. Everyone in today's society is like this. Even physicians, whose mission is to "save lives and benefit the people," cannot be an exception. The level of a physician's diagnosis fees is often seen as an indicator of their status. In general society, the status of a physician, the quality of their skills, and the excellence of their abilities are largely judged by the level of their diagnosis fees. Physicians themselves almost undoubtedly accept this as a rule.

It goes without saying that two physicians with similar backgrounds and equal skills may be seen as having different status and abilities simply because their diagnosis fees differ. Even a skilled and highly competent physician might be seen by the general public as having lower status and skills than an incompetent doctor with expensive fees! Don't we often hear people saying things like, "Dr. So-and-so is a highly reputable physician with great status. Their surgical fees must be hundreds of thousands or even millions," or "Dr. So-and-so's medical skills must be excellent and outstanding. Their consultation fee is thirty, fifty, or even a hundred thousand, and a house call costs hundreds of thousands!" Or, "Dr. So-and-so's consultation fee is only a few hundred or thousand; they probably aren't very skilled," or "Dr. So-and-so's surgical fees are less than tens of thousands, not even comparable to the consultation fee of the big-name doctors. They might just be a charlatan!"... Therefore, the amount charged for diagnosis and the level of fees have unconsciously become the sole standard by which the general public judges a physician's status and skill.

Because the general public equates high diagnosis fees with high status and skill, clever physicians who "know the times" seize upon this popular psychology. They use various methods to raise their fees, thereby increasing their own status and position. Otherwise, they would lower their own value, fail to demonstrate their noble physician status, and be scorned by patients as "cheap goods are no good!" In the self-perception of a large number of physicians, diagnosis fees, whether high or low, have unconsciously become a determinant of their own reputation, position, and status.

In reality, this kind of thinking is very incorrect, this kind of psychology is very inappropriate, and this kind of view is completely wrong and utterly unacceptable. In fact, a physician's status should not be elevated by excessively high diagnosis fees, and the quality of their skills should definitely not be judged by the level of their fees. There are certainly skilled physicians who charge high fees, but who dares to say that there are no quacks with a flashy style among them? There may be physicians with ordinary skills who charge low fees, but there may also be competent and honest good doctors.

Therefore, it is unreasonable and does not correspond to the truth to view the level of diagnosis fees as a standard for a physician's status and skill.

Let us investigate: if the general public holds the incorrect psychological notion that "high diagnosis fees equal high physician status" when dealing with medical problems, and physicians take advantage of this unreasonable popular psychology in their diagnosis and treatment work, what impact will this have on society and the public? I believe that it will very obviously lead to a very negative phenomenon and facts that are extremely unfavorable to the general public.

This is such an obvious fact! Raising diagnosis fees inevitably reduces the opportunity for medical treatment for patients with limited financial means. Everyone knows that society should not be a society of a few wealthy people, but a society belonging to the entire populace. "Serving society" is our sole creed as physicians, isn't it? "Benefiting the people" is also our sole mission as physicians, isn't it? However, the "society" we serve should not be limited to the society of a few wealthy people; it should also be the society of the majority of common people. The world we save and the people we benefit should not be limited to the world and people of a few propertied individuals; it should also be the world and people of the majority of the working class. Raising diagnosis fees and reducing the number of patients treated directly contradicts the purpose of serving society and the mission of saving lives and benefiting the people. If a physician's diagnosis fees are set excessively high, not only will the majority of the lower classes be unable to seek treatment when they are sick, but even patients from the middle class with moderate financial means will feel that medical care is too expensive, making it easy to get sick but difficult to seek diagnosis and treatment!

If doctors can truly understand the real meaning of "serving society," and do not elevate their own status by raising diagnosis fees and reducing opportunities for diagnosis and treatment for the general working class, but instead cater to the tastes of the public and meet the needs of patients from the middle and lower classes, reducing diagnosis fees as much as possible to expand the scope of medical services, then they are the physicians welcomed by the masses in today's society. Only physicians who are welcomed by the masses can be considered to have truly fulfilled the mission of "serving society" and truly deserving of the status and virtue of a physician. As for the general public, if they can also change their erroneous psychology of viewing the level of a physician's diagnosis fees as an indicator of their status, and instead use their work skills, service spirit, attitude towards patients, and personal virtue as standards for a physician's status and character, then that is a reasonable and correct view. Using this reasonable view and correct notion as a standard for choosing a doctor when sick will prevent being fooled by quack doctors and ensure satisfactory medical results.

### Review of Combined Injection of Glucose Calcium and Vitamin C

— Narrated by Song Guobin, Recorded by Song Enhao

Before the invention of specific drugs for tuberculosis, chemical therapy had undergone countless changes in the past thirty years. At present, the most popular and widespread chemical therapy used by general physicians is the combined injection of glucose calcium and Vitamin C. From major cities to remote villages, all physicians know how to use it, and I have never heard any criticism of it. I am not talented, but I have doubts about it. Please let me explain the reasons.

(1) During the active phase of tuberculosis, the patient's minerals and calcium are consumed in large quantities. The former is called demineralization, and the latter is called decalcification. Fever, expectoration, tooth decay, and phosphate in urine are all manifestations of these phenomena. Therefore, patients need to supplement calcium (recalcification) and minerals (remineralization). Thus, glucose calcium injection is included as one of the chemical therapies.

(2) Acidic substances may dissolve calcium. For this reason, acidic foods are strictly prohibited in the diet of tuberculosis patients. For example, alcohol, ethanol, beer, vinegar, coffee, lemons, oranges, apples, tomatoes, spinach, etc., contain various acids, such as acetic acid, oxalic acid, citric acid, and malic acid, so they are all prohibited. After consuming these acidic foods, the consumption of calcium in the body will increase. Drugs that are acidic are naturally not suitable for tuberculosis patients.

(3) Based on the two phenomena listed above, it can be seen that calcium agents are suitable for tuberculosis patients, and acidic drugs are not suitable. Vitamin C is nothing else; its scientific name is ascorbic acid. Combined injection with glucose calcium is obviously a contradictory effect. After injection, the calcium loses its effect. Although there is no significant damage, there is no benefit either.

(4) Furthermore, calcium injections are not suitable for general tuberculosis patients. For example, in patients with fibrotic and calcified tuberculosis, the calcium in the body has reached a saturation level, and calcium injections may not be beneficial. In elderly patients, whose blood vessels have hardened, injecting calcium agents will only make the hardening worse. Therefore, glucose calcium injections are only suitable for patients with active tuberculosis. The combined injection with Vitamin C is even more unreasonable.

### After Reading "The Problem of the Spleen"

— Yao Xingshu

Although I am not a sentimental person, after reading Mr. Yu Yunxiu's "The Problem of the Spleen" (see the first issue of this journal), I cannot help but feel something. I write these disorganized thoughts, with no great arguments, just to fill the space.

1. Japanese doctors call our ancient and modern term "spleen," which represents the digestive gland, "pancreas." I have been thinking about it for a long time, but I can't figure out the reason. Many of our modern medical books are translated from Japanese or written with reference to Japanese books, so the term "pancreas" is used quite a bit. This "pancreas" character looks like a Chinese character, but it is actually made in Japan. The Japanese have their own pronunciation for it, but because it has the moon radical next to the "cui" character, we read it as "cui." The term "pancreas" originally had problems. Chinese people are not always ignorant, and the term approved by our Ministry of Education has been changed to "pancreas." The name "pancreas" is probably considered colloquial. This soft, reddish-yellow thing is also found in pigs. Ordinary people call it "pancreas." Before there was snow cream or turtle oil, women used it to prevent wrinkles on their hands in winter. According to Mr. Yu, if we don't forget our ancestors, the name "pancreas" also has problems and is worth discussing. We will put that aside for now. In any case, the two characters "pancreas" should not be used anymore. However, I accidentally flipped to page 51 of Volume 2 of the National Elementary School Natural Science Textbook, which still uses these two characters, while the middle school physiology and hygiene book uses "pancreas." It is said that there are many questionable aspects to the content of national textbooks, and this is naturally a very minor one.

2. The Japanese call what we call "spleen" "pancreas," and use "spleen" to name something we don't know. We are still following this, which is Mr. Yu's "Problem of the Spleen." The Japanese can be said to be good at stirring things up and calling a deer a horse. The Japanese are really "idiots." When we open a Japanese medical book, the "ying" character in "nutrition" is written as "rong." "Nutrition" is a physiological term, while "rongyang" has other meanings. The so-called raising parents and supporting them is what filial sons say to their fathers. The Japanese have always messed up Chinese characters. For example, we humbly call "my place" and "my shop" "bi chu" and "bi dian," but the Japanese write them as "bi chu" and "bi dian," regardless of whether they are fair and honest. If Chinese people imitate them, it would become a big joke, wouldn't it? Recently, I read Mr. Chen Fangzhi's book on acute and chronic infectious diseases, which uses the two characters "rongyang" extensively, which is quite strange. Mr. Chen's book is very valuable and I would like to recommend it to readers. I am being overly critical, and it seems a bit like I am finding fault with Mr. Chen.

3. There is another term that the Japanese have mixed up with us. Japanese doctors often call their private clinics "hospital," which is not surprising. What we call hospitals, they call "sanatorium." A hospital with only one shopfront in Shanghai makes knowledgeable people feel cold, but the Japanese see it as a matter of course. Nowadays, no one is talking about learning from Japan anymore—in fact, people are probably afraid that they will never learn from them—if someone dares to call their clinic a hospital, they must be careful that health officials will come looking for trouble.

In short, even if these are small matters, if others have already made a mistake, why should we repeat it?

### Review of the Use of "Streptomycin" in the Treatment of Tuberculosis (4)

— Yang Shida

(4) Tuberculous Empyema

Dr. Ying Xiao once used "Streptomycin" to treat seven cases of tuberculous chronic empyema. Four of them only used intrapleural injection, and did not achieve any effect. The other three used intrapleural lavage and intramuscular injection at the same time, and only one of them undoubtedly achieved an effect. In 1942, this patient requested thoracotomy to remove three ribs and the intercostal muscles attached to them; the purpose was to drain the pus and mixed infected tracheo-pleural fistula. Under these circumstances, "Streptomycin" can be sprayed on the pleura with a nebulizer, and at the same time, a large amount of intramuscular injection can be applied. The tracheo-pleural fistula closed very quickly. After three months of treatment, the tuberculosis bacteria in the pus were also eliminated. Previously, this individual had been observed for four years, and various treatments had been tried without success.

It is quite surprising that the bactericidal effect of "Streptomycin" cannot be fully exerted in tuberculous empyema. This is probably because empyema fluid is usually acidic, but "Streptomycin" can easily exert its power in neutral or alkaline conditions. At the same time, it should be noted that tuberculosis is a granulomatous proliferation, not a simple tuberculosis bacteria.

(5) Tuberculous Fistula

Dr. Ying Xiao once used "Streptomycin" to treat fifteen patients with epidermal fistulas, and tuberculosis bacteria were found in the pus of all of them. One of them had multiple lesions, such as sinus tracts of the submandibular lymph nodes, sinus tracts of the inguinal lymph nodes, and sinus tracts of the thoracic cage. The lesions were located in the neck and axillary lymph nodes in about six patients, in the thoracic cage in two patients, in the abdominal wall in one patient, and in the scrotum in two patients. Two patients had rib tuberculosis, and one patient had tuberculous scalp ulcer, which occurred after osteotomy and brain tuberculoma resection surgery. The patient with brain tuberculoma only received six months of "Streptomycin" treatment, and the neurological effect was gradually achieved, probably due to the success of the surgery. Furthermore, that patient died elsewhere six months later.

After four to six weeks of injection, all fifteen patients achieved an effect: the pus was eliminated and the wound was closed, which is proof of the effectiveness. However, if treatment is stopped at this time, short-term recurrence is common. Therefore, after superficial success is achieved, treatment must be continued for several weeks. The effect obtained later can be maintained for a longer period. Among the fifteen patients, the sinus tracts of ten patients had been closed for four to twelve months, three patients remained in a recurring state, and two patients had recently recovered and were still undergoing treatment. In order to obtain long-term and complete recovery, it is considered appropriate to continue injecting two centimeters of "Streptomycin" daily for three to four months.

"Streptomycin" can indeed close several stubborn sinus tracts, such as thoracic tuberculosis and tuberculous lymphadenitis. In order to avoid recurrence, treatment should continue for several weeks after the wound has closed.

(6) Tuberculosis of the Genitourinary System

According to Dr. Ying Xiao's experience, "Streptomycin" can stop the progression of tuberculous cystitis and maintain a stable state. In most cases, it only has palliative value. It has no therapeutic effect on kidney tuberculosis. If tuberculous cystitis is selected at an earlier stage, when the bladder wall has not yet undergone a high degree of fibrosis, the micro-effects after treatment will be more significant.

In these specially selected cases, although the tuberculosis bacteria in the urine have been confirmed to be eliminated by animal inoculation, there is still a tendency for them to reappear. If tuberculosis bacteria are rediscovered in the urine after a long period of treatment, it can be determined that those tuberculosis bacteria have drug-resistant power in vitro. In Dr. Ying Xiao's treatment of fifteen patients, the symptoms were often alleviated for a long time in about 50% of the cases. Two of the earliest treated patients had been treated for eighteen years and continued to experience symptom alleviation, but a small number of tuberculosis bacteria were still occasionally found in the urine. Among the fifteen patients, two had tuberculous epididymitis, causing scrotal sinus tracts. Tuberculosis bacteria were also found in the pus. After several weeks of treatment, the sinus tracts closed, and after the treatment was stopped, each remained in a state of recovery for six months and ten months.

In summary: "Streptomycin" can achieve temporary effects in the treatment of tuberculous cystitis, and true effects on kidney tuberculosis are rarely seen. Therefore, "Streptomycin" therapy cannot replace surgery for unilateral kidney tuberculosis.

(7) Tuberculosis of Bones and Joints

Dr. Ying Xiao has treated five cases of tuberculosis of bones and joints. Generally speaking, the external effect is significant.

(8) Adult Surgical Pulmonary Tuberculosis

"Streptomycin" has been used simultaneously with surgery in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis. A considerable amount of injection was given before the surgery. As for the injection after the surgery, its main purpose is to prevent the occurrence of tuberculous complications. Generally speaking, "Streptomycin" can help the body recover.

### Guangling Flower Society - Yangzhou Continuing the Dream (12)

— Hong Weifa

The location of the Guangling Flower Society was near the old city's Eight Alleys in present-day Yangzhou, and it operated from the first to the fourth year of the Republic of China (1912-1915). Although named a flower society, it was actually a teahouse, but it was clearly different from the average teahouse in terms of elegance. The three large rooms facing south were designated as the rooms for Qin, Chess, Calligraphy, and Painting. Judging from this name, it is not difficult to understand the composition of the teahouse's patrons and their activities. A shed was built in front of the hall, which was also used for selling tea. The surrounding flowers and trees were lush, giving it a small garden-like charm. At the very beginning, there was a row of cloisters. At the end of the cloisters was a "music room" facing south. The owner, Mr. Yan, was not primarily interested in making a profit, but in having the pleasure of music and strings. Therefore, every day after sunset and the lights were lit, the drums and flutes resounded in the music room, and the singing was loud and clear. At this time, most of the tea patrons had already left one after another, and those who remained were either people who loved to sing a song or those who appreciated the music.

In this flower society, there were three people who were often praised: Xie Chunjiang, who sang Kunqu opera; Wang Lang, who played the flute; and Guangxia, who played the Guqin. Guangxia was a monk from the Hua Temple, Wang Lang was a Taoist priest from the Zanhua Palace, and Xie Chunjiang had donated to become a candidate for the salt and fire envoy, so he could be considered a man who had "read the books of sages." It was truly a combination of Confucianism, Buddhism, and Taoism.

Taoist priests are often good at playing musical instruments, and Wang Lang was famous for his flute. Guangxia, although a monk, did not abstain from meat, so he had grown fat and full. However, he played the Guqin very well, and no one in Yangzhou could match him. If you closed your eyes and listened attentively to his clear Qin sounds, it would truly make you dispel worldly worries and feel as if you were in another noble universe. You would no longer think that the person playing the Qin in front of you was a drunken monk. Speaking of Xie Chunjiang, it is said that his family used to be well-off, but because he loved Kunqu opera and did not engage in production, he gradually became impoverished over time. However, he still enjoyed it. A person familiar with him told the author: "I remember one day, in a light drizzle, he was walking through Biluo Spring Alley towards the parade ground when he suddenly heard a family in the alley teaching young prostitutes how to sing opera songs. He stopped and leaned against the door, listening attentively and tapping his toes to the beat. After a long time, an old friend happened to pass by and saw him standing there foolishly. He was very surprised, and stepped forward to pat him on the shoulder and call 'Chun Weng,' which made him realize that he had been standing there for a long time and his clothes were all wet. His friend teased him and said, 'Chun Weng! Your behavior is almost the same as Jia Baoyu in the Dream of the Red Chamber!' They couldn't help but burst into laughter." It turned out that Xie Chunjiang was an opera fanatic.

The lifespan of this flower society was only a short four years before it closed down. The three people mentioned above, who were often praised in the flower society, also scattered and eventually found their final resting places. Regardless of whether "silk is not as good as bamboo, and bamboo is not as good as meat," the performances of these three in terms of silk, bamboo, and meat can never be heard again. Even if there are successors, who else can be as kind as Mr. Yan and open another Guangling Flower Society?

### Landscape

— Zhu Qishi

Mr. Niu’s – "Daily Lesson"
— Hei Pingfu

It's no wonder. Ever since Mr. Niu married Mrs. Niu, he hasn't given her a single good day. In these three "years of hardship," time has flown by for over a thousand days, and there have been hardly any stretches of four or five days where they could afford to cook regularly. In other words, Mr. Niu's skills are rarely enough to prevent his family from running out of food for four or five consecutive days. What's worse, even two meals a day are often uncertain. As a result, Mr. Niu's entire family looks gaunt and pale today.

Initially, Mrs. Niu fully understood Mr. Niu's situation. At that time, the world was in chaos, and the enemy and puppets were rampant. Mr. Niu, with his scholar's integrity, would rather suffer from hunger and cold than seek "cultivation, cultivation" from certain "prominent" classmates or relatives. On the other hand, Mrs. Niu was also quite good. Although she felt constantly inferior due to the intense spiritual pressure around her, she still believed that "it's better to starve to death than to be a traitor." Therefore, Mr. and Mrs. Niu endured hardships together, waiting for the light without complaint. They thought, "Once the country is victorious, everything will be fine. Suffering a little now is nothing when we're young."

Unexpectedly, a full year passed, and Mr. Niu's family was still worried about three meals a day and living hand to mouth. As a result, Mrs. Niu began to look down on Mr. Niu. She often said to him coldly, "You couldn't make a name for yourself during the time of the traitors, but that was for the sake of the country. However, it's been so long since the devils collapsed, and yet you haven't managed to improve things even slightly. The puppet currency was issued by the traitors, so it wouldn't come your way, but the legal tender also disappears for three to five days at a time. Could it be that the country no longer recognizes you as its citizen? There are four hundred and fifty million compatriots, everyone…"

Mr. Niu's face burned, and his heart ached. He couldn't answer his wife's sarcastic remarks. He secretly rolled his eyes at her, thinking that he was indeed letting himself down. However, these kinds of cold words were just the beginning of Mrs. Niu's daily "lesson." Whenever there was no firewood or rice, this "lesson" would always escalate into a fight with Mr. Niu, sometimes without a resolution.

Although Mr. Niu often thought to himself, "If I had known I would end up in this situation, I wouldn't have married her even if she had beaten me to death. Even a clever woman can't cook without rice. I used to think she was like Wang Baochuan, and that eighteen years in a cold cave would be no problem. Who knew that after only three years, she would look down on me so much that I could never turn things around?" However, whenever Mr. Niu thought this, Mrs. Niu seemed to read his mind and instantly transformed from a state of cold sarcasm to an uncontrollable storm. At this point, Mr. Niu would also lose his temper and blurt out all his grievances, leading to an "irreconcilable" shouting match.

Mrs. Niu's first sentence usually involved a favorable reference: "When I married you, your family wasn't overflowing with gold and silver. To be honest, I don't care about being poor. If I were materialistic, I wouldn't have married you in the first place. Don't you think about it yourself? The world is big, and there are poor people everywhere, but how many unlucky people are there like you who have no food to eat no matter where you go? Tell me, how many people like you are there in the world?" These "ironclad facts" would infuriate Mr. Niu, making his eyes burn with anger. The more ashamed he felt, the more she would repeat these words endlessly until Mr. Niu couldn't bear it anymore and stormed out of the house in a huff. However, their young child, who had just learned to talk, would chase after him, crying and shouting. Mr. Niu felt trapped. He thought, "It's not a solution to keep arguing. I should focus on figuring out how to get food!" The child said from the side, "Daddy, I'm hungry, I'm hungry, I want to eat!"

The next day, Mr. Niu's "daily lesson" started again, just like yesterday. Meanwhile, the radio in the neighbor's house was playing "Red Mane Steed," the opera that caused him the most mental distress.

Lyrical Poems

### Spring's Summons

— Jiaoben

When the river that plays the music of spring
First rolled past my side

When our village
First smiled at the sun

When the constant warm wind
First blew towards the distant grasslands

When the dawn crow
First brightened the blue sky

I
The caresser of spring
Shed the bitter cold
Shed the thick layer of ice
Began my first summons to spring

Like the river that plays the music of spring
First rolled past my side

First Words

The mountain yearns deeply for the beauty of wisdom with love,
I bravely reveal to you my tightly closed heart:
The undying soul is the embodiment of hard work,
Idleness is a great waste to life;
Do not hate the gorgeous flowers in spring,
Nor should you look coldly at the simple branches and leaves in autumn;
If we have not violated the sacred truth,
Then let us sail together in the human ocean.

Smoke from the Chimney

A puff of rice straw fragrance,
Smoke from the chimney rose…
There is one more cloud in the mountains,
There is joy in the world,
Smoke from the chimney says:
The hungry morning person,
Can get some warmth and food…

Hair

Whirling on the summit of thought,
The knot of thousands of thoughts.
What a beautiful color,
Nourishing the soul's heartland.
The fruit of wisdom love,
The root of wisdom!
If mankind wants eternal life,
Then first of all, you must stay young.

On the way back to the country from Europe, I playfully filled in Water Dragon Chant to entertain myself. Yiqiao note again.

### An Inch of Mountain and River, an Inch of Blood 197

— Ye Jingfeng

I wondered why we were standing. Tsurumi was putting on a show there, so why didn't we sit down and enjoy it? I called Yaoqun and Huchen over and chose a nearby table to sit down. When the waiter saw us, he immediately came over. Yaoqun and I were preoccupied, so we each ordered an iced coffee, but Huchen ordered two servings of Water Chestnut Jelly, two servings of Ice Cream, and four servings of pastries, preparing for a big feast.

Unfortunately, his appetite was not to be satisfied. As soon as the waiter who was serving us had written down our orders and scurried away, and as Huchen was rubbing his fists, ready to enjoy his meal, we suddenly heard a burst of gunfire in the distance—bang...bang bang bang...bang—

This gunshot pattern, "one three one", was precisely the signal for Commander W's troops to begin their operation. As soon as the gunfire sounded, a moment of silence fell inside and outside the door. The reason for this silence was that we, on our side, knew that the commando team that had been sent out had returned and were sending a signal to notify us, so of course we quieted down and watched the enemy's movements. The enemy, on the other hand, was suddenly startled by the gunfire and couldn't figure out what was going on, so they couldn't help but be surprised and tense. As a result, this moment of silence was created.

But this silence passed in the blink of an eye. We saw the outside of the door first stir up, and after a flurry of running footsteps, an enemy scout burst into the hall, rushing towards the wide-eyed, astonished "Commander Jin" and raising his hand:

"Report—the enemy is surrounding us from three sides, there are many of them, it's over!"

After giving his report, he turned to run. However, the floor of this fire hall was entirely made of high-quality willow wood rhombuses, which were incomparably hard, planed to a high gloss, and covered with a thick layer of wax, making it very slippery. The scout, turning too quickly and wearing a pair of clunky nail boots, lost his footing and immediately went sprawling, face-planting like a hungry dog lunging for shit.

Before the fellow could even stand up, a burst of laughter was heard, followed by a clear, sweet, and incomparably smooth female voice shouting loudly from behind us:

"Tsurumi-dage..." The Tokyo accent was spot-on.

I turned around and saw a graceful woman walking swiftly and lightly towards Tsurumi from the elevator area. As she walked, she said with a smile:

"I'm late... I should be responsible for introducing you all!" The "you all" of course referred to Tsurumi and the "Commander Jin."

Her demeanor was indeed elegant and poised. Compared to the "Commander Jin", she was obviously refined and he was vulgar, and they were not comparable. But compared to our Yaoqun, one felt that one was vigorous and graceful, and the other was delicate and charming.

"Ah, Miss Pingzi...!" Tsurumi bowed formally.

"Dage good you." Although Pingzi was wearing a Beijing-style cheongsam, she performed a Japanese bow: "Let me introduce you two," she bowed to the "Commander Jin"; "This is Tsurumi Tamakun of the General Staff, a newly accepted student of Old Master Konoe!" She bowed to Tsurumi again; "This is Miss Inoue Yoneko, the new commander of the Second Action Team under Commander Kawashima of the North China Garrison Headquarters." Pingzi emphasized the identities of both sides by mentioning the names of Konoe and Kawashima Yoshiko.

In this urgent and chaotic scene, this calm social interlude suddenly intruded, and this extremely disharmonious focus was concentrated on the fake "Commander Jin," Yoneko. She seemed embarrassed and couldn't turn her face around, making it a bit awkward for her to get off the stage. I wanted to see how this fellow would deal with this embarrassing situation, so I watched her very carefully.

Free Talk

### Chang Banqing is Dead

— Mei Bai

Chang Banqing has already been executed by shooting in the Shanghai Prison. Our only feeling about the death of such a villainous and scandalous traitor is that he has consumed too much prison food until now!

Chang Yuqing was the "Chairman" of some "Yellow Way Society". What we want to specifically point out is whether the miasma-like thinking of this "Yellow Way Society" and the like has been completely eradicated.

People are enthusiastically debating the issue of atomic energy, while what about us? A year ago, there was the so-called "Yiguandao" mega-case, and recently in Shanghai, there was also something about fox fire burning, something like "fox fire not more than three times" and other "news"! To this day, there is still a small shop like a temple on Lafayette Road, with vermillion plaques and golden characters, proclaiming "Great Immortal Wang" in large letters. As for the practice of spirit writing, it is even more extremely "prosperous". It is said that those "spirit writing altars" are even organized to unite, and in addition to "uniformly disseminating news from the immortal world," they also want to uniformly organize things like "spring relief" and "spring prayers"—in other words, they are mutually supporting each other and intensifying their efforts to collect money!

The blindly following citizens are simply "ignorant." When education becomes a luxury, "ignorance" is forgivable, but "ignorance" is also one of the most dangerous enemies of our old nation, because there are people who are taking advantage of this "ignorant" mentality for ulterior motives. When the world is chaotic, the years are lean, and society is unstable, this kind of ambition forms the "Yellow Way Society" and "Yiguandao"!

During the occupation of Shanghai, the trend of seeking spirits through spirit writing was particularly prevalent, mainly because the enemy deliberately condoned it: on the one hand, they feared that the Chinese people would not be "stupid," and on the other hand, they may have wanted to cultivate the power of people like Chang Yuqing.

The country must keep up with the times, and the miasma-like morbidities must be swept away! The Ministry of Internal Affairs has already ordered the prohibition of the bad habit of taking "immortal prescriptions." Shanghai should take a step further than the mainland. We demand a "cleaning movement" to kick out these "great immortals" and "spirit writing altars"!

### Hell's Chapter

— Chang Kong

Perhaps I shouldn't have a bad temper, but as soon as I hear that someone has gone into the water, attached himself to the enemy, no matter if he (she) only held a small position the size of a sesame seed, I always detest them to the extreme.

Perhaps he has his own hardships?

But I always believe that as long as he has eaten the enemy's "salary", he is always shameful.

But things often go beyond the norm. Many people once received "favors" from the enemy before the War of Resistance, but during the later stages of the war, they went to the rear to "wash" themselves, and when victory came, they were also "Chongqing people" in Shanghai. They didn't even wipe the shit off their asses, aren't they ashamed?

Because I am naturally disgusted with these "neither donkey nor horse" characters, I am very afraid of interacting with them. But here is an analogy: to say that a person is afraid of someone interfering with his "freedom", so he locks himself in his room every day, but the "unfree" hand will knock on your "door" "outside" the door. Can this "door" hold off external interference? This is almost a dream.

Based on this reason, every time I meet those "yin-yang people", I hope to have less contact with them, but they come to your side, pat you on the shoulder, pull your hand, they want to be intimately close to you. You say: don't you extend your hand? You say you can refuse to shake hands with such a person in person?

Based on this reason, it is no wonder that measures such as "killing relatives for justice" are "extremely rare" now.

### Selling Official Positions – The Current State of Corruption in the Former Qing Officialdom

— Aiju

I followed my elders to the capital in the year of Ji Mao and only left Beijing in the year of Geng Zi. What I heard and saw in twenty years was considerable. When I was young, I rarely went out, and when I grew older, I devoted myself to studying for the imperial examinations, so I never wrote it down in books, but used it as material for conversation when friends gathered. Before Tian You, Prince Gong was in power. In the middle of the Guangxu reign, Prince Li held the central government for the longest time. There was a second-hand clothing store inside Houmen called Baofengcheng. The person in charge was surnamed Tian. He was outside the former three gates every day (Qianmen, Xuanwu, Chongwen, were the former three gates. All prosperous shops were outside these three gates.) socializing with food and drink. At first, I didn't know what he was doing. During the years of Xin Mao and Ren Chen, two of my cousins entered the capital as Daotai with special imperial edicts. In the late spring of Xin Mao, my elder cousin and cousin met Tian in Wanfuju on Yangmei Zhuxie Street. Someone who knew him asked if he had any valuable gifts recently. Tian said he had two inkstones that could be called rare treasures. My cousin also needed to send gifts to someone at the time, so he said, "Can I go to Houmen with you tomorrow to take a look?" After making an appointment, he went to Baofengcheng with a friend the next day. The storefront was extremely spacious. Inside the counter were sable and fox furs and other treasures, hanging on all four walls, which were already beautiful beyond compare. Then they entered a fine room filled with porcelain, copper, jade, stones, calligraphy, steles, and other antiques, even more dazzling. His friend secretly told his cousin that everything else could be chosen at will, but the two inkstones would be shown by him, and he should not touch them. After they sat down, they saw that the inkstones were a Han tile and a red silk Duan inkstone, placed on a large table by the window, with extremely exquisite decorations, covered with glass. Tian took out a small booklet, explaining that the tile inkstone was collected by Ruan Yuan, and the stone inkstone belonged to Mingzhu (a powerful minister during the Kangxi era), all recorded in books and passed down in an orderly manner, recently held by an old family who wished to sell them at a good price. My cousin, knowing that it would be difficult to obtain, only laid out a medium-quality sable coat with a sea otter collar and discussed the price with him. Tian then summoned his subordinate to take out an account book and show it, and the price was so high that it was beyond imagination. My cousin reluctantly said no and returned home with his friend. In the evening, he changed cups and drank in his residence on Dongcheng Root in Qianmen. My cousin said to someone, "What I saw today was dazzling. Please quickly explain this riddle." Someone said: "This is the outer residence of a certain prince. Half of the exquisite objects are taken from the palace (referring to the prince's residence using Mencius's words). The price for wanting to see the prince's face is a certain amount, the price for wanting to get an introduction of eight lines (not a tea ticket, but from the eunuchs of his party) is a certain amount, and the price for wanting to point out a certain lucrative position (such as the silk weaving bureau, customs, provincial financial commissioners, and provincial education commissioners of Sichuan and Guangdong) is a certain amount. The prices in the book are not prices of goods, but prices of events. After negotiation, it is ostensibly a gift sent to the prince's residence, in order to achieve various purposes, while the goods are still circulating within the residence. The technique is so clever! This kind of mysterious method was created by the previous prince, and the later prince followed the rules. The bannermen who opened offices in various provinces also followed suit, such as Yu Kuan, the governor of Bian, and Hai Xiaofeng, the governor of Gan, who were the most notable. Alas, noble relatives, important border guards, but so corrupt! How can the country not perish? Recently, in the case of the foreign tiger, Miss Bohr's confession repeatedly involved important government officials. Although the matter may not be true, there is no smoke without fire. I sincerely hope that those people will correct themselves if they have done wrong, and if they have not, they should encourage themselves.

### Haimen Mountain Song

— Li

(1) The four-line mountain song, two lines are true, the last two lines make people laugh; the lazy toad flaps its wings and flies to the East Sea, the small paddy chicken struggles on the mountain corner. (捔 pronounced xuē, meaning collision.)

(2) The lying girl sings a lying song, cooked tofu has more bones; the wind blows the stone, it turns without stopping, making a rat's nest on the cat's head.

### Junru Su Yun and Others – Recollections of Old Actors, Second of the Young Male Actors

— Tingsong

When Fang Yantuan's performances were at their peak, Gui Guan's collaboration with Lao Tan in "Zonghuai Zhou," his collaboration with Luo Baisui in "Welcome to the Third Grade," his collaboration with Ziyun Xiaofu in "Yutangchun," and his collaboration with Chen Delin and Qian Jinfu in "North and South Harmony" -- if Gui Guan was absent from any of these plays, the entire audience would be unhappy. He was so famous at the time. Xin Pei, discussing the talent of young male actors at the time, sighed and said, "De Junru and Zhu Suyun were all beautiful young male actors, but they were not as outstanding as Leng Xian." De was the grandson of Grand Secretary Mu Zhang'a and the nephew of the Sacrificial Wine Sa Lian. Because Grand Secretary Mu was the presiding examiner of the Jiyou imperial examination and Sa Gong must have been in attendance, De Gong was able to avoid revealing his identity. However, his Suona and Erhuang tunes, sung high into the clouds, such as Luo Cheng's Calling at the Pass and Xiao Xian, were truly unmatched at the time. Zhu was most skilled in plays such as Shooting the Halberd at Baimen Tower, and people all said that he had truly obtained Xiao Xiang's true teachings, unparalleled in his time, and also excelled at eight kinds of jokes. He wrote Liu-style calligraphy with extremely beautiful strokes. Officials in the capital would often ask him to write name cards, and the literary officials all sighed in their inferiority. However, because he was short in stature, Jiao Tian often joked, "You are an exquisite miniature landscape on stage!" However, his collaboration with Xiao Duo (i.e., Yang Guiyun's son) in plays such as "Contented Marriage," "Rouge Trial," and "First Book of Rainbow Pass" was truly unmatched by other famous actors because of his romance, elegance, mastery of both civil and military skills, so every performance was always packed. "Rouge Trial" has become a lost art, and Zhu Suyun's beauty as E Qiuhun, with her graceful demeanor and expressive glances, and her unspoken understanding with Xiao Duo at the beginning of the play, with her father Gui Yun's consort, Madame Gong, watching coldly from the sidelines, her expression was somewhat like the matchmaker Liu in "Picking Up the Jade Bracelet" and the Wang Po in "Picking the Curtain and Tailoring Clothes," but more restrained. Such a fine play cannot be seen again today.

### Sound Recording Telephone – A Novel Tool

— Ya Mu

The world is vast, and there is nothing that is not strange, especially the new inventions of the scientific community. Recently, the clever Swiss have again presented the world with a newly invented "sound recording telephone"!

Readers must be eager to know what this "sound recording telephone" is like, so let me give a brief introduction. According to news from the British scientific community, this new device has the special function of recording text in addition to the general features of automatic operation. For example, if you have to go out on business and cannot answer the phone yourself, but you are not comfortable letting someone else answer it for you, then the most appropriate way is to install a "sound recording telephone". It will automatically tell the person calling that "I'm very sorry, our host is not at home at the moment, please tell us what you want so that we can record it." In this way, the caller will do as told, and the "sound recording telephone" will trouble itself to record these meanings on the phone, so that you can see everything clearly as soon as you return.

Naturally, sound recording telephones are extremely effective communication tools for individuals, businesses, and any organization, but I wonder when they will be brought to China.

Joan Crawford stars in "A Woman's Secret," a masterpiece exposing the French people's resistance under the Nazi jackboots. The film is now showing at the Grand China Theatre.

### Record of a Besieged City

— Qin Ou

"General Manager," A Shi walked in from outside the door, speaking Mandarin with a Cantonese accent to his master, "The assistant managers from the China Tea Company are on the phone!"

"Excuse me, I'll go listen to the call and come back." The fat man suddenly became happy, and rolled out like a ball.

The smile on Lao Zhu's face disappeared, and he felt a little embarrassed. He had not held excessive hopes for the donation campaign for the troops. He already knew how disheartened the people in the rear had become in the past year or two. But he was an enthusiastic person, with a kind of naive optimism, always wanting to do his best and make the greatest contribution to this country battered by wind and rain. Xu Shaoming was not only his classmate, but also someone he dared not offend for a reason. However, under the belief that fleeing in a hurry and rushing to transport supplies was the top priority, he had become firm with him today.

When it really came to the point of no return, he could use a form of coercion against Lao Xu, but he didn't want to do that. And the matter of donating money to support the troops, whenever he pondered it alone, he never felt it was very meaningful. Everything in the country was so bad in normal times, the soldiers' treatment was so poor in normal times, now it's like a patient reaching a critical moment, and then wanting to inject a stimulant to save their life. Whether it would really work, even the most optimistic person like him couldn't say. The reason why he enthusiastically initiated and completed this campaign this time was nothing more than to boost morale and inspire spirits. How much money could be raised was secondary. He was simply indignant at Xu Shao's refusal to donate a single hair, which is why he was bothering him. But Xu Shaoming only agreed to donate 50,000 yuan!

"...The only way to make him submit is to use a method of application. If he persists, I might have to play a trick on him."

He stretched out a long leg and continued to sit on the sofa in contemplation, as he had been before.

He waited for about twenty minutes before Xu Shaoming excitedly rushed in.

"Lao Zhu, are you eating here? I still have a bottle of Moutai. Let's finish it all before we flee. Hahaha!" The phone call he received had obviously given him excellent news, which made him much happier than before, and he had forgotten Lao Zhu's purpose in coming.

"Drinking and eating, of course I'll join!" In front of people, Lao Zhu always acted happy as usual. "What good news did you get, brother? Is it... did someone else put out cheap goods?"

The person being asked smiled mysteriously.

"I've bought enough goods! It's about the trucks. The fat man hesitated slightly, originally not wanting to say, but this matter made him so excited that he couldn't hold back. "The China Tea Company has six five-ton trucks that were originally going to Hengyang to rush to transport tea. Later, everyone advised their assistant managers not to do such a foolish thing anymore. Going to Hengyang at this time is like courting death. It's better to pay some freight and let us rush out more supplies. Their assistant managers are also smart people and already agreed yesterday. But there were too many people who wanted them, so they didn't decide who to give them to at the time. He called me just now and agreed to give me three. This makes things much easier!" As he spoke, he kept rubbing his ten fat fingers, which looked like ginseng, full of triumph. (Thirteen)
