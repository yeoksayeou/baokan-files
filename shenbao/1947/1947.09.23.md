### The UN Steering Committee Passes the Motion to Include the Korean Question on the Agenda; Our Delegation Explains the Reasons for Supporting the US Proposal but Reserves the Right to Advocate for Korean Independence

[Central News Agency, Chenggong Lake, 21st] Today, the United Nations Steering Committee passed a motion with twelve votes against two to recommend that the General Assembly discuss the Korean independence question proposed by the United States. The Soviet Union and Poland voted against the motion. The Soviet representative, Gromyko, criticized the opinions of most committee members, stating that Marshall's speech to the General Assembly on the 17th "erroneously and distortedly" reported the situation in Korea. He also stated that according to the Four-Power Moscow Agreement of December 1945, the Korean question should be resolved through negotiations between the Soviet Union, the United States, China, and the United Kingdom. The United States' submission of the question to the United Nations General Assembly was a rebellion against its agreement with the other three powers, and therefore this matter was "illegal." The US representative, Austin, replied that according to Article 14 of the United Nations Charter, the United Nations General Assembly can make any recommendations on any issue related to the general welfare of countries, and therefore the United States' raising of this issue was purely within the explicit provisions and spirit of the Charter. Austin pointed out that the reason why the Korean question was suffering setbacks was because the four powers had failed to reach an agreement. He said, "Under such circumstances, aside from submitting it to the General Assembly for discussion, is there any other way?"

[United Press, New York, 21st] The Korean Observer Group attending the United Nations General Assembly today issued a statement criticizing the Soviet Union's opposition to the United States' proposal to have the General Assembly discuss the Korean question, stating that according to various reports, northern Korea has now become a Communist military base, full of Korean Communist troops, Chinese Eighth Route Army troops, and frontline Soviet troops. Although the number of US occupation troops in southern Korea has decreased, estimated at only 30,000, the number of Soviet troops in the north has increased instead, reaching 300,000.

[Associated Press, Chenggong Lake, 21st] Today, the Chinese representative, Yuan Weijun, formally announced in the United Nations Steering Committee that China agrees with the United States' proposal to include the question of Korean independence on the agenda of this General Assembly, and stated China's position: "The Chinese delegation agrees to include the United States' proposal regarding Korean independence on the agenda of this General Assembly. However, we still hope to clarify China's position. According to the Cairo Declaration (which the Soviet Union subsequently agreed to in Potsdam), the four major powers all guaranteed the restoration of Korean independence. The Moscow Agreement of December 1945 between the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union (which China also agreed to afterward) also stipulated that the four countries should negotiate and agree to establish a provisional government for Korea and establish a free and independent Korea as soon as possible. Before the four powers sign a new agreement to change or substantially alter the above two agreements, the four countries should still be bound by the obligations stipulated in these two agreements. Including the Korean question on the agenda of the General Assembly does not affect the four countries' status under the above agreements. The future of Korea has a great and profound relationship with China, so we sincerely hope that all countries should make every effort to accelerate Korea's achievement of freedom and independence and occupy its rightful place in the United Nations. The Chinese delegation also hopes to state that our explanation is limited to describing our reasons for supporting the US proposal. When discussing the merits of this issue in the future, we will elaborate on our position at that time."

### Passage of Motion to Establish a 55-Nation Standing Committee

[Reuters, Lake Success, New York, 21st] Today, the Steering Committee of the United Nations General Assembly passed, with fourteen votes against two, a motion to include on the agenda of this General Assembly the proposal by Secretary of State Marshall to establish a 55-nation standing committee. Only the Soviet Union and Poland opposed the motion. During the debate, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Shijie, while supporting the inclusion of the proposal on the agenda, stated that he reserved China's attitude when debating the merits and demerits of the plan. The Soviet representative, Gromyko, consistently opposed the plan, denouncing it as conflicting with the basic principles of the United Nations organization. He stated that the standing committee's powers would be parallel to those of the Security Council, making it an illegal and unconstitutional organization. Once the Charter is violated, it will lead to extremely dangerous habits, causing the Charter to no longer be respected, which would be detrimental to the United Nations organization and not beneficial. The US representative, Austin, refuted Gromyko's claim that the proposal was illegal, pointing out that the proposal was not only completely legal but could also revitalize the principles of the Charter and the United Nations organization.

### International Women's Association Holds General Assembly in Nanjing; Madame Chiang Kai-shek Delivers Speech, Hoping Friends Can Truly Understand China

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 22nd] The International Women's Association held a general assembly at Jinling Women's University at 4:30 PM today. Over a hundred people attended, including Madame Chiang Kai-shek, Wu Yifang, Lady Ponsonby, wife of the British Ambassador, the wife of the Indian Ambassador, and women from various countries who have come to China. Chairman Maynard delivered a speech, reporting the association's purpose: to serve society, establish international friendship, and enhance mutual understanding. Madame Chiang Kai-shek then delivered a speech, stating in brief: "This international organization fully demonstrates the true meaning of the world as one family. You have come from different countries, and I hope that you can exchange and contribute the cultural spirit of your respective countries with each other. When you return to your countries in the future, the impressions you bring back will constitute important data for your personal impressions of China. I have long had a simple idea, and I firmly believe that life should have two major goals, and these two goals have a very close relationship in human behavior, namely: how to cultivate and enhance one's own wisdom and spirituality, and how to help others cultivate and enhance their wisdom and spirituality. I would like to offer some suggestions that may help you understand China. I suggest that your association understand the thinking of the Chinese people by studying and exploring the cultural heritage of China. In addition, if you want to deeply understand China, I hope that you can interact more with the Chinese people. China has recently undergone the refining of fire and blood, but it has not yielded slightly. In China's extremely difficult times, peace-loving people around the world have given China valuable encouragement and assistance. However, we also know that there must be a time when many Chinese friends will be disappointed by the delay in China's rejuvenation work. But no matter how serious the difficulties and hardships, we will never be discouraged, but will make us more determined and stronger. There are still difficult years ahead for China, but whether we receive world assistance or not, we are prepared to strive for success to the end. I feel deeply in the venue today that everyone is expressing sympathy and understanding for China's current arduous task. I hope that you can truly understand China. After you return to your countries in the future, I believe that you will all become important links in promoting international understanding, and thus establish peace in the future world."

The association believes that the South African Federal Government's promulgation of this discriminatory law against overseas Chinese has a significant impact on the relations between the two countries and immediately telegraphed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, requesting a serious negotiation.

### Business Representatives to Japan; Joint Presidium Compulsory Dispatch; Elections Have Begun in Various Places

[This newspaper, Nanjing, 22nd] Various places have begun selecting business representatives to be dispatched to Japan and are processing application procedures. The representative from Taiwan Province has been determined, but some places have also been allocated quotas but do not intend to nominate candidates. A reporter recently learned from reliable sources that the Standing Committee does not intend to take other measures because trade with Japan does not imply any coercion. Whether or not to go depends entirely on individual interest. Another person familiar with the international trade situation stated that trade with Japan may be difficult to progress because Japanese goods are expensive and of poor quality, with little profit to be made. The number of British businessmen going to Japan is also less than originally planned, and the reason is also this.

### Zhang Zhizhong Discusses the Political Situation in Xinjiang; Good Relations Between China and the Soviet Union Will Have a Positive Impact; Winning Hearts and Minds Must Start with the Economy

[This newspaper, Nanjing, 22nd] Chairman Chiang is scheduled to host a banquet for Provincial Committee member Burhan at 6 PM on the 23rd. Zhang Zhizhong hosted a banquet for Burhan at his residence at 7 PM on the 22nd and invited key government officials to accompany him. Zhang Min has been waiting for the government's final instructions on Xinjiang Province to decide on his course of action. Zhang told reporters today that he believes that the Xinjiang issue should still be mainly economic. As the saying goes, "He who has milk is the mother." We must make the compatriots in Xinjiang Province feel good about the government, otherwise, the border issue will not be easy to resolve. Zhang also stated that Chairman Chiang also agreed with this view. He and Maswood co-drafted a plan and presented it to the Chairman to develop the wealth of Xinjiang Province and suggested the establishment of a technical guidance circle for Xinjiang construction. The plan has now been sent to the Executive Yuan. After the case is approved, Zhang will hire engineering and mining technology, animal husbandry, and various technical talents in Beijing to go to Xinjiang. Zhang said that the general situation in Xinjiang is currently very stable. Both sides in Beitashan are still in confrontation. The main peak of the mountain is now in the hands of the national army. The national army in Xinjiang is strong, and there is no military problem. The Beitashan incident will not turn into a more serious incident. Zhang believes that the Xinjiang issue is a national issue. If relations between China and the Soviet Union can improve, everything will have a positive impact, not just the Xinjiang issue. Zhang said that he is collecting materials to study the China-Soviet issue. Zhang refused to express his opinion on Vice President Sun's recent remarks on China's foreign policy, only saying that China's current problems are part of the world's problems. China's foreign policy is independent and autonomous, and the relationship between China's situation and the world situation cannot be denied. Regarding the Yining issue, Zhang said: "The Yining people oppose Maswood's leadership in Xinjiang and hope that I will stay in office. In fact, there is no reason to oppose Maswood. Maswood's prestige, learning, and his history of struggle should make him the leader of Xinjiang. The central government will not change the decree that has already been issued because of what is involved in trust. If the Yining people insist, we will consider the next step. The so-called Turkestan movement is an independence movement, but Xinjiang does not have enough conditions for independence, and only the three districts of Yili, Tacheng, and Altay support this movement. The remaining seven districts, which account for more than 80% of the total population, support the central government. The central government's orders cannot reach only the three districts of Yili, Tacheng, and Altay. A reporter asked: "Is the Yining rebellion led by Akhmetjan?" Zhang replied: "Akhmetjan was the vice-chairman supported by the Yining people after the reorganization of the Xinjiang provincial government and was later appointed by the central government." A reporter asked: "Is it true that Akhmetjan is a Soviet citizen, as rumored?" Zhang replied: "Yining borders the Soviet Union, and this statement cannot be verified." Zhang said that there is no communist party activity in Xinjiang, even if there is, it is secret. Zhang denied that he was one of the candidates for the ambassador to the Soviet Union being considered by Chairman Chiang, and his return date has not been determined. Finally, Zhang said that in the future, to solve the Xinjiang problem, we should base ourselves on democracy, give the people freedom, abolish the past policies that harmed the people, make the high-pressure methods of the Sheng Shicai era a historical relic, and create a peaceful, democratic, and happy Xinjiang.

### Zhang Attends Welcome Meeting; Encourages Sincere Cooperation to Give Play to the Three Powers

[This newspaper, Changchun, 22nd] The Changchun City All Sectors Welcome Tea Party was held at the Lizhi Society at 2:30 PM on the 22nd. President Zhang first took the stage to deliver a speech, saying that the trip to the Northeast was planned long ago. Now, due to busy official duties, he cannot stay long, but the central government is always paying attention to our Northeast, especially Changchun, an important city on the front line of the war. In fact, the safety of the Northeast does not understand the relationship with our country, but also the relationship with the world, so the various sectors in this place should understand this situation. Local people are finally promoting civil rights, government personnel should exercise political power well, maintain law and order, and the army that defends the country should give full play to military power. All aspects must be integrated into one and cooperate seamlessly. The first purpose of this trip is to examine the implementation of the central government's policies in the local area and whether there are any inconsistencies in the local implementation. Therefore, it is hoped that the attendees can speak frankly and truthfully, and if there is anything that needs to be handled by the central government, it will be handled after returning to Beijing. After the meeting, President Zhang inspected the city appearance for an hour and flew back to Shenyang at about 6 o'clock.

[This newspaper, Changchun, 22nd] President Zhang told the press: "I have read the editorials of various newspapers as soon as I arrived in Changchun, one of which is titled 'Listen more, see more, say more, and do more'." President Zhang said that he will naturally make efforts in doing more in the future, but he is also willing to listen more and see more, so as to understand.

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 22nd] President Zhang attended the welcome tea party for all sectors in Changchun City on the afternoon of the 22nd. After Chairman Liang Huasheng gave a brief speech, President Zhang stood up and spoke with great excitement. He encouraged many times. After listening to the statements of people from all walks of life, he gave a 30-minute speech. He first said: "The government not only attaches importance to the Northeast militarily, but also politically and economically. Strengthening the military can be explained by the fact that Chief of Staff Chen also serves as the Director of the Northeast Executive Yuan. The fact that a large number of soldiers and weapons have been replenished in recent months is enough to prove it. Therefore, the Northeast must have politics and economy that can match the military in the future, so that the government can realize its wish to 'recover the Northeast' and 'build the Northeast'." Then he said: "The difficulty in exporting soybeans in the Northeast has been obtained from this trip to the Northeast, and a thorough method of improvement will be studied after returning to Beijing. As for the currency system inside and outside the customs, the issue of the legal tender going out of the customs is still worth considering, because although the price index in the Northeast is also increasing day by day, there are still differences compared with inside the customs." Zhang Yuanwei said at the end: "We not only have the determination to eliminate the communist bandits, but also the determination to build a healthy and happy Northeast, so that the Northeast, which has been suffering for fifty years, will become the base of a strong China and the paradise of the Three Principles of the People."

If the election authorities in charge discover that a voter has two or more voting rights during the investigation and registration of the voter registration list, they should also order them to identify one. All voters of organizations in the textile industry and women's organizations should be identified by the individuals themselves. The right to vote should never be identified by the organization to which they belong, nor can it be identified by the entire membership in a meeting to prevent military elections and prevent abuses. As for those voters of professional women's organizations who did not declare when registering in the voter registration list, they will also be regarded as participating in the election of professional or women's organizations. The above regulations have also been usually transferred to the election offices of various provinces and cities to be followed.

### Problems of Subsidies for Posts, Telecommunications, and Railways; The Ministry of Communications Decides to Convene Another Meeting; A Specific Method is Prepared to Submit to the Executive Yuan Meeting

[This newspaper, Nanjing, 22nd] According to government regulations, subsidies for state-owned enterprises will be completely stopped from October 1, except for a very few. The most relevant of these are the posts, telecommunications, and railways under the Ministry of Communications. The Ministry of Communications previously convened a meeting of relevant departments to discuss this matter and requested that the cancellation of subsidies be temporarily postponed. Now, with less than ten days before the deadline, everything needs to be decided urgently. The Ministry of Communications is convening a meeting of relevant parties to discuss and propose concrete measures before the Executive Yuan meeting. It is reported that the following principles will be used to propose measures separately during the discussion: 1. If all subsidies are cancelled, how should the prices of various state-owned enterprises under the Ministry of Communications be adjusted? 2. If the government continues to subsidize state-owned enterprises, what will the prices be? 3. If the amount of subsidies increases or decreases, how should the prices be adjusted? So that the Executive Yuan can be asked to discuss.

### The Supervisory Yuan Discusses the Treatment of Civil Servants; Advocates Issuing Salaries According to the Index; Pushes Yu Shude, etc. to Propose Concrete Measures

[This newspaper, Nanjing, 22nd] The problem of improving the treatment of civil servants was discussed again at the conversation meeting of the Supervisory Yuan on the morning of the 22nd, and further decisions were made. The main purpose is to achieve the equality of survival advocated by Sun Yat-sen, so that superiors and subordinates can share weal and woe. The following decisions were made in principle at today's meeting: 1. The current cost of living index has risen to more than 50,000 times before the war, that is, according to the official statistics, it has risen to 31,000 times, while the civil servants are still paid according to 1,600 times, which is unreasonable. However, if calculated according to 30,000 times or 50,000 times, the national treasury cannot afford it. However, it is estimated that 30 yuan was enough for ordinary civil servants to cover one month's expenses before the war. If this 30 yuan can be distributed universally regardless of superiors or subordinates according to the cost of living index, it can solve the minimum living needs. Those above 30 yuan will be paid according to the current standard to show the difference in work. 2. If the above method is difficult to implement, it will be issued according to half of 31,000 times, that is, 15,000 times. If the implementation of these two methods is difficult, in order to make the upper and lower levels uniformly plan, the following two methods seem feasible:

### It is Proposed that the Government Be Responsible for the Education of Civil Servants' Children

Rice, rice, oil, salt, medicine, housing, and children's education are all borne by the government; in addition, a "pocket money" is given. The physical and welfare benefits enjoyed by ministers and section members are not light, only the pocket money is slightly higher. 2. Implement the distribution system according to the British method, but this method is not easy to implement. At the end of the meeting, it was decided to push the three members, Yu Shude, Wan Can, and Li Shijun, to jointly draft a draft, and then submit it at the next meeting.

China and the Philippines already have a temporary agreement, which has now expired, and the two sides are seeking to conclude a new agreement and have made some compromises. Recently, our government has issued instructions to the embassy in the Philippines on this matter. Regarding the location of the negotiations, our side suggested holding them in China, or they may be linked. As for China-India negotiations, they could have started earlier, but they were repeatedly delayed due to internal turmoil in India and are difficult to implement in the short term. However, before the new agreement is signed, the original method will still be valid. Regarding Sino-Japanese navigation, air navigation is in progress, while sea navigation will depend on future trade conditions.

### The People of Tongguan are Extremely Stable, Residents in the Suburbs are Busy with the Autumn Harvest and Not Alarmed at All, Culverts and Bridges Between Wenxiang and Xin'an are Damaged by Bandits

Since the Communist bandits were defeated in Taiyugou on the 15th and gathered their remnants, many bandit soldiers have been pressed into battle. Now, many people have surrendered with weapons. Our air force cooperated with the ground National Army to launch counterattacks for days, and the prelude to the great battle in western Henan has begun. Residents in the suburbs of Tongguan are currently busy with the autumn harvest and are not alarmed at all. The market is normal, and the people are stable, which is even better than Xi'an. The Communist bandits in western Henan have thoroughly destroyed the culverts and bridges east of Wenxiang to Xin'an, and have also erected the rails and burned them with sleepers.

Editorial

### Xinjiang Problem and General Zhang Zhizhong

Regarding the recent situation in Xinjiang, since General Zhang Zhizhong, Director of the Northwest Headquarters, gave a concise report to the Kuomintang Central Party and State Joint Conference on the 11th of this month, the people of the country should have understood the true picture and the crux of the so-called Xinjiang problem. Coincidentally, Burhan, a member of the National Government Committee from Xinjiang, and Muhammad Emin, Director of the Xinjiang Provincial Construction Department, flew from Dihua to Nanjing to pay respects to the central government. On the 21st, Burhan told reporters in Nanjing that there are no major problems in Xinjiang at present, and some problems are expected to be resolved peacefully. He will also suggest to the government that Xinjiang should always be a territory of the Republic of China. Burhan is from Tacheng, Xinjiang. He studied in Germany in his early years and is proficient in various languages ​​such as Chinese, Uyghur, Russian, and German. He has written many works. When General Zhang Zhizhong presided over Xinjiang, he served as the Deputy Governor of the province. In April of this year, when the National Government was reorganized, he was elected as a member of the National Government Committee, representing the virtuous people of society. Emin is a student who studied in his own country, is familiar with Islamic culture, and is proficient in Turkish, Indian, English, and Uyghur languages. He once worked for the central government. Both of them are enlightened figures in Xinjiang Province. Now, when the Xinjiang issue has reached a turning point, they traveled together to Nanjing and made important suggestions to the central government, which seems to imply the bright future of the Xinjiang issue, and the turmoil in the western border is expected to gradually disappear. In fact, looking at it from a longer perspective, we are not yet allowed to be so optimistic today.

Xinjiang is a province of the Republic of China, a remote and desolate place, but it is rich in resources and strategically important. The emergence of Xinjiang as a problem seems on the surface to be intricate and complex, involving diplomatic problems, religious problems, social problems, ethnic problems, etc., intertwined and unclear. In reality, the Xinjiang problem is quite simple. With his two years of experience in governing Xinjiang, General Zhang Zhizhong pointed out that the Xinjiang problem is an intertwining of diplomatic and ethnic problems. To solve this problem in the future, we should take a two-pronged approach of ethnicity and diplomacy, and the most fundamental thing is to actively promote the Principle of People's Livelihood and complete the construction of Xinjiang. Zhang's few words may sound like clichés, but they are actually very insightful and practical.

Let us unfold the map of Xinjiang and look around: on the edge of the Pamir Plateau, from the Pyanj River to Zirgos (located west of Yili, the border point after the Qing Emperor repeatedly lost territory to Ningguo), to Habar Asu (north of Tacheng), Ulegey, and then from Ulegey southeast to Hatori, there is a long and winding border line of thousands of miles. Beyond this line, the vast desert is a sea of red. There are strict administrations, organized business groups and cultural groups, constantly extending outwards and pressing outwards with a sense of "security," which has led to serious diplomatic problems.

The second is the ethnic problem. Xinjiang has a population of 4.3 million, of which about 4 million are Muslims with a unique religious culture. The more than 4 million people each have their own customs, languages ​​and scripts. The Uyghur population is larger, followed by the Kazakhs, and the Uyghurs and Kazakhs are also incompatible with each other, with political ups and downs, which forms a serious ethnic problem. Due to the misgovernment of the local authorities in Xinjiang in the past, bloody conflicts have occurred among the ethnic groups many times, so the ethnic problem is even more connected with the diplomatic problem, and the Yining rebellion occurred in September 1945.

The Yili Incident was mainly led by the Kazakhs, and the three districts of Yili, Tacheng, and Ashan all fell. At this time, it was the end of the Anti-Japanese War. In order to strive for domestic peace, the central government sent General Zhang Zhizhong to Xinjiang to deal with the situation and held eight negotiations with Yili, and a peace agreement was reached. On July 1st last year, the Xinjiang Provincial Government was reorganized according to the peace terms, and Yili participated in the provincial government with six committee members. In May of this year, Masud was ordered to be the Chairman of Xinjiang, and the Baitashan Incident broke out soon after. Before the Baitashan Incident was resolved, a separatist movement occurred in the Xinjiang provincial government. First, the senators of the three districts of Yitaa refused to attend the Provincial Senate, and then Vice Chairman Ahmetjan and Committee Member and Deputy Director Lai Ximujiang resigned. General Zhang Zhizhong recently sent an open letter to Ah Lai, sternly questioning whether he wanted to unilaterally tear up the peace agreement? Was there going to be another armed rebellion? Or was he willing to return to Dihua for sincere discussions? As of now, there has been no response from Yili. Fortunately, the relationship between Dihua and Yili can still be maintained, and there is no sign of complete rupture. However, General Zhang Zhizhong, representing the central government, has been holding a policy of step-by-step concession, but this unresolved problem has not been solved, and the night is still long and full of dreams.

General Zhang Zhizhong has ambitions and insights in governing Xinjiang. We believe that he must have steps to deal with the Yili issue. The trip to Nanjing by Burhan and Emin further shows that among the more than 4 million people in Xinjiang, more than 3 million recognize the central government and support the central government. Only 700,000 people in the three districts of Yitaa, under the separatist conspiracy of a few ambitious people, are engaged in fierce political struggles with Dihua. Looking at the trend, the diplomatic and ethnic problems of Xinjiang are no longer local problems, and it is almost impossible to find solutions within Xinjiang Province. The central government may accept the new suggestions of Zhang and Burhan, and with extreme tolerance and wisdom, reopen the door for peaceful negotiations on the Xinjiang issue. We very much agree with the principle of "peaceful unification, democracy and freedom." Only by jointly adhering to the grand goal of peaceful unification, democracy and freedom can we unite the various ethnic groups in Xinjiang, and then use the strength of ethnic unity to work hard on economic construction and seek stability in Xinjiang. However, no matter how much we wish for this, are the few ambitious people willing to give up their mentality of relying on foreign aid and work together for the construction and stability of Xinjiang? Finally, let us try to broaden our horizons further. The Xinjiang problem is almost a microcosm of the overall situation in China, and the stalemate in China's negotiations with the Soviet Union and the ultimate rebellion of the Communist bandits can almost be seen as a microcosm of the unsolvable disputes in the global situation. The Xinjiang problem is probably not easy to completely solve well at present. However, in any case, we must do our best to work hard, and senior officials who have been entrusted with important responsibilities in one area, such as General Zhang Zhizhong, should return to defend and sit in northern Xinjiang as soon as possible, so as to stabilize Xinjiang and win the hearts of the people in Shaanxi and Gansu.

### British Representative Reviews World Situation, Sternly Condemns Soviet Attitude, Hopes Soviet Union Will Change Course and Save Peace

[This newspaper's dispatch] Broadcast from Lake Success on the 22nd: Today, British Minister of State Mr. McNeil, the chief representative attending the United Nations General Assembly, delivered a speech to the assembly, 2,600 words long, clarifying the basic policies of the United Kingdom. It stated that if the Soviet Union continues to force its will upon the countries of the world, world peace will collapse, causing serious consequences. He criticized the Soviet Union sternly, but still hoped that the Soviet Union would change its attitude. Mr. McNeil dismissed as absurd Vyshinsky's claim that the United States has a tendency to instigate war. He strongly denied Vyshinsky's claim that the Marshall Plan for European economic aid threatens the sovereignty of European countries, and pointed out that the Soviet Union deliberately hindered the passage of the atomic energy control plan and used its veto power ten times. Mr. McNeil's speech touched on all aspects of the world political situation, but his main argument was to condemn the Soviet Union's uncompromising attitude and the serious impact of this attitude on world peace. Mr. McNeil also said that the Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference to be held in London in November this year will be the last hope for restoring peace.

[United Press, Flushing Meadow, 22nd] Britain today joined the United States in publicly criticizing the Soviet Union for undermining the United Nations. Austin, in his first official reply to the Soviet Union, bluntly accused Vyshinsky of lying by calling the United States a "war monger," and said that Vyshinsky's speech at the General Assembly was a slanderous and provocative lie. British representative McNeil, following Austin's lead, will deliver a speech at the General Assembly to "shatter" the Soviet Union's arguments accusing Britain and the United States of being war mongers and undermining the United Nations. Mr. McNeil will review the entire situation of the United Nations, and, like Marshall, will completely blame the Soviet Union for the current paralysis.

### Amendment to the Italian Peace Treaty Added to UN General Assembly Agenda, China, Britain and Other Allied Nations Abstain, Soviet Union and Poland Vote Against

[Reuters, Lake Success, New York, 21st] The Steering Committee of the General Assembly today passed by a vote of four to two to add the amendment to the Italian Peace Treaty to the agenda for discussion by the General Assembly. The United States, Mexico, Cuba, and Brazil voted in favor, and the Soviet Union and Poland voted against. Eight countries, including China and Britain, abstained. The proposal was put forward by Argentina. British representative Shawcross said during the discussion that the British government believes that it is unwise for the General Assembly to discuss the amendment of the Italian Peace Treaty at this time. The British government has always believed that the provisions of the Italian Peace Treaty are not entirely satisfactory, but it is very doubtful whether it is appropriate to amend it at this time. Although the United Kingdom does not oppose the proposal, it does not seem to be able to support it. Polish representative Ransan Lian told the meeting that the General Assembly's immediate discussion of the amendment to the Italian Peace Treaty would dangerously hinder the conclusion of peace treaties with Germany and Japan. The Allied countries would therefore allow Germany and Japan to sign peace treaties with extremely strong reservations. The Italian Peace Treaty has only been ratified for one week, and the General Assembly's discussion of its amendment is a great encouragement to Germany and Japan. Syrian representative Koli advocated that the Security Council should quickly recommend Italy's accession to the United Nations. After joining, Italy would have the opportunity to request an amendment to the treaty. Soviet representative Gromyko said that the United States did not express any intention to amend the treaty when negotiating the Italian Peace Treaty, and the United States' sudden change of attitude did not surprise the Soviet Union. This move by the United States would make it impossible for the Allied countries to cooperate more easily when negotiating peace treaties with Germany and Japan. Argentina's proposal suggested that countries that signed the Italian Peace Treaty should give Italy the opportunity to put forward new opinions to reduce the obligations imposed on Italy by the treaty.

### Steering Committee Passes Soviet Proposal to Add to Agenda

[Central News Agency, Flushing, 21st] After clarifying that the General Assembly has full authority to discuss any issues related to international security and peace, the Steering Committee of the General Assembly today unanimously passed the Soviet proposal to add to the agenda the case of the General Assembly adopting countermeasures to stop the propaganda and instigation of another war.

[Associated Press dispatch] The Steering Committee then quickly passed two Yugoslav proposals with the following content: To prevent the dissemination of defamatory reports against foreign countries, so as to harm international friendship and violate the purposes and principles of the United Nations organization. To ensure the extradition of war criminals, traitors and puppets to the victimized countries.

### British Colonial Secretary Jones Flies to New York to Attend Discussion on Palestine Issue

[Reuters, London, 22nd] British Colonial Secretary Jones is scheduled to fly to New York today to attend the General Assembly meeting and present Britain's views during the debate on the Palestine issue. The British government's position has been decided by the cabinet at a special meeting on Friday. It is expected that Jones will declare that if the United Nations organization has no new proposals, Britain is prepared to hand over the trusteeship of the Holy Land and withdraw its troops from the area.

[Associated Press, London, 21st] Foreign Office officials declared today: After Britain submitted the Palestine issue to the General Assembly, it is willing to accept the partition plan for Palestine, but will insist that other member states assist in fulfilling this task. This point is recognized as the future position of the British government.

[Associated Press, London, 21st] The Arab League representative declared today: If the United Nations wants to partition Palestine, the Arab countries will implement economic and cultural sanctions against Europe and the United States.

### British Foreign Office Spokesman Criticizes Romanian and Bulgarian Governments, Also Issues Warning to Hungary

[Central News Agency, London, 21st, United Press] A British Foreign Office spokesman today criticized the Bulgarian and Romanian governments for not being able to represent their countries, saying that if these countries violate the principles of the peace treaty again, they will constitute a crime against European civilization. His attack on Hungary was lighter, believing that there were many Communists in the country and their power was disproportionate, and said, "The lessons of Romania and Bulgaria should be a warning to the Hungarians."

### France Willing to Act as Mediator to Eliminate Differences Between the United States and the Soviet Union, President and Prime Minister Call for Peace in Speeches

[Reuters, Paris, 21st] Since Marshall and Vyshinsky had a head-on conflict at the General Assembly meeting, French people have been fearing that a new war will break out again. The words of French President Auriol and Prime Minister Ramadier also reflect this mentality. Both of them stressed that France will continue to work hard to reconcile the opinions of the East and the West. They also declared that the peace treaty with Germany should ensure that France has security guarantees, and France should have preferential rights over Germany in economic reconstruction. Auriol said that he earnestly hopes that the powerful countries guiding world affairs can assume the highest responsibility and bring peace to the world. If peace cannot be achieved among the powerful countries, and the armed fear that will inevitably lead to war continues to be maintained, it will be a terrible mockery of the fate of mankind. Prime Minister Ramadier also said that Europe does not exclude any country, and recognizes that both the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom are part of Europe. The table in Europe is a round table, which allows all countries in Eastern and Western Europe to sit at the same table in a completely equal position. He continued, the foundation of peace is now threatened, and if peace is not guaranteed, nothing will be achieved. The diverse interpretations within the country caused by French Foreign Minister Bidault's speech at the General Assembly reflect the fact that most of the French people are unwilling to be forced to definitely participate in the ranks of either the Soviet Union or the Soviet Union.

### Indonesian Government Announces Basic Policy Towards the Netherlands, Foreign Minister Wang Meets With Sjahrir

[Reuters, Batavia, 22nd] Radio Yogyakarta announced: The Indonesian cabinet held a meeting for three days under the chairmanship of President Sukarno, and announced on the night of the 22nd the basic policy of the Republic towards the Netherlands, the main points of which are as follows: The Indonesian cabinet has decided to eliminate the unrest and disorder caused by the Dutch military's invasion of Indonesian territory; The cabinet is determined to maintain peace and order, as well as the freedom of action of the Indonesian people; Post-war reconstruction work on the islands will continue, regardless of whether there is assistance from the Dutch side; Foreign relations will be strengthened.

According to a spokesman for the Republic, the Republic will use these points as a standard to cooperate with the rest of the world on the basis of equality. If the Dutch are willing to accept the above promises, peace talks can begin immediately. This conflict was initiated by the Dutch side, and the Indonesian government has no intention of continuing the state of conflict. The spokesman also said that before peace negotiations begin, the Dutch military must withdraw from the territory occupied by its so-called police action.

### Truman and Cabinet Members Begin Consultations, Marshall Returns to Washington Posthaste, Opinions Differ on Convening Special Session of Congress

[United Press, Washington, 22nd] President Truman held a meeting with three cabinet members today to discuss the two urgent issues of increasing aid to Europe and balancing domestic prices.

[Associated Press, Washington, 21st] Secretary of State Marshall took time out from New York tonight to return here to meet with President Truman tomorrow afternoon to discuss world political and economic issues and decide on countermeasures for major issues.

[Associated Press, Washington, 21st] President Truman discovered on the 21st that his senior advisers had sharp divisions of opinion on current serious issues, namely whether to convene a special session of Congress to deal with the increasingly serious domestic and foreign economic crises. Administration officials said that the president would be forced to reach a "gentleman's agreement" with Republican congressional leaders before taking any action. For this reason, Truman's subordinates are all strongly opposed to convening a special session of Congress unless it is a last resort. It is said that the authorities suggested that the Republican-controlled Congress is very likely to reject the group leader to stop the high domestic prices and the European famine problem. On the other hand, the Secretary of State expressed that this emergency action is necessary to save Europe. If the Congress of the War is not convened, the necessary expedient aid policy cannot be implemented.

### Economic Conference of 16 European Countries, Representatives Sign Report, Needs US Aid of $16 Billion

[Associated Press, Paris, 22nd] The Economic Cooperation Conference of 16 European countries has been held for ten weeks. This afternoon, representatives went to the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs to sign the report, which is 20,000 words long. It lists the resources, self-help procedures of Western and Southern Europe, and, based on the needs of US Secretary of State Marshall's plan for European economic recovery, suggests that the United States should provide aid of $16.295 billion in the next four years. A British Air Force special plane is now on standby to transport the report to Washington. According to people attending the meeting, the budget for income and expenditure from 1948 to 1951 is as follows: The 16 European countries must import food, raw materials, and production equipment totaling $35 billion. $15 billion can be offset by exports or other means. The shortage totals $19.689 billion, of which $3.394 billion will be borrowed from the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and the remaining $16.295 billion should be provided by the United States. All representatives are uneasy about the outcome of the report. The final decision on this matter rests with the US Congress, and the US Congress may not be able to discuss it until next spring, but it is hoped that the United States can design temporary aid measures.

### Egypt to Expand Military, Workers Hold Anti-British and American Demonstrations

[Reuters, Cairo, 21st] Egyptian Prime Minister Nokrashy addressed the Saadi Party he founded after returning to the country from the United States yesterday, saying that Egypt's top priority at present is to strengthen its military strength to cope with any contingencies. He said that he had talked too much in the past, and from now on he should work hard to defend the country.

[Associated Press, Cairo, 21st] More than a thousand workers from the Egyptian Army Factory demonstrated to the Prime Minister's Office today because the Security Council had not made a decision on Egypt's request, chanting "Down with Britain and the United States" and "Down with China, France and Brazil" for failing to support Egypt in the Security Council.

### Soviet Union Incapable of War in Next 25 Years, Observations of Mr. Reppsche

[United Press, Washington, 21st] Mr. Reppsche, director of the Soviet Union Department of the State Department, told reporters today that the Soviet Union's industry is incapable of preparing for war against the United States for at least 25 years. This weakness may extend to 50 years, and we do not need to worry about the Soviet Union as a potential enemy. Mr. Reppsche has been studying the Soviet Union for 24 years and said that the Soviet Union is using all its strength to build heavy industry, especially steel, railways, and farm implements. Light industry accounts for only one-third of its post-war recovery plan. Mr. Reppsche did not mention how the Soviet Union's satellite countries and the Soviet-occupied zone of Germany supply the Soviet Union.

### Some US Officials Stationed in Japan Advocate That Japan Should Have a Large-Scale Merchant Fleet, Claimed That the Minimum Livelihood of the Japanese Cannot Be Maintained Without This

[United Press, Tokyo, 22nd] Several US officials here said that Japan should be allowed to have a fairly large-scale merchant fleet to achieve the living standards stipulated by the Allied countries. Japan itself cannot produce enough products and cannot obtain goods from foreign countries. Therefore, if Japan needs to achieve the minimum standard of living, it should have a good merchant fleet. An Allied official said: "If Japan can have a merchant fleet, it can increase its national income and make up for the shortcomings that exist between its necessities and the gains from its small export trade." If Japan encourages travel and trade to Japan, operates a "merchant fleet," and transports raw materials from abroad, it can establish its foreign assets. An Allied official said that Japan currently has 777 iron-hulled ships of more than 100 tons, with a total tonnage of more than one million tons. In 1939, Japan had a total tonnage of 5,629,845 tons. Since 1927, the tonnage of Japanese ships has been more than 4 million tons.

### Iranian Parliament Opens Fierce Debate on Transfer of Oil Rights to Soviet Union, Opposition Party Accuses Negotiations of Being Illegal

[Associated Press, Tehran, 21st] The Iranian Parliament today questioned whether the oil rights negotiations conducted by Iranian Prime Minister Saltaneh in Moscow last year were legal, on the grounds that the Prime Minister did not receive a vote of confidence in the previous parliament. This is the first time the new parliament has mentioned passing the Soviet oil rights issue. Parliamentarian Aiteber accused the Prime Minister of not being a representative of the people and having no right to negotiate on behalf of the people. Mr. Aiteber is a powerful independent opposition in parliament, advocating that Iran review the oil rights enjoyed by another foreign country (referring to the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company). Saltaneh and others were present during the debate.

[Associated Press, Tehran, 22nd] Foreign observers said that if the opposition continues to attack before the oil case is submitted to the parliament, Prime Minister Saltaneh may submit his resignation.

### Export Products to Japan – Implementation of Different Exchange Rate System – Large Quantities of Soviet Goods Shipped to Japan

(United Press Tokyo, 22nd) It has been learned that, in order to remedy the high cost of Japanese export goods, the Allied Headquarters is implementing a plan to apply different exchange rates to various goods. According to Jabby, an Indian merchant who was among the first to arrive in Japan, the different exchange rates for US dollars to Japanese yen range from 120-130 yen to over 250 yen per US dollar (the current official exchange rate set by the military government is 50 yen per US dollar). This move attempts to encourage buyers to purchase more Japanese goods and to provide Japanese exporters with a better opportunity to compete in the world market.

(United Press Tokyo, 22nd) The Allied Headquarters announced that the agreement between Japan and the Soviet Union to exchange 100 wooden tugboats and 75 barges for 25,000 tons of coking coal has officially taken effect. The Allied Headquarters stated that 1,500 metric tons of vulcanized pulp will be shipped from Sakhalin to Japan this week for use in manufacturing export paper. The Soviet Union has also sold 4,000 metric tons of graphite to Japan for use in manufacturing high-grade steel.

### More Japanese War Suspects Released

(United Press Tokyo, 22nd) The Legal Section of the Allied Headquarters announced on the 22nd that in the five weeks before September 1st, 51 Japanese war suspects were arrested and detained in Sugamo Prison, while another 157 suspects were released or transferred for trial.

### Fourth Session of the Municipal Council Opens – Speaker Presents Three Points – Austerity Movement Has Reached an Inevitable Stage

(Our Report) The fourth session of the first Shanghai Municipal Council officially opened at 9:00 AM yesterday at the Council's location on Tanggu Road. 146 councilors were in attendance, with Mayor Wu, bureau chiefs, and other party, government, and military leaders, along with chairmen of district people's representative assemblies, district保長 (bao zhang, local heads), and dozens of others present as observers. At the opening ceremony, Speaker Pan delivered a speech, stating: "The first general assembly of the Shanghai Municipal Council was held in September of last year, and a year has now passed. In the past year, although we have not made many suggestions and contributions to municipal facilities, we have more or less fulfilled our responsibility to represent the citizens, increase their welfare, and reduce their suffering. At the same time, we have also considered the needs of the municipal government, hoping to do as much as possible under poor economic conditions." The speaker also mentioned that the current situation is at a critical juncture, and that the high prices in the city are related to the overall situation. The Mid-Autumn Festival is also approaching, and prices tend to fluctuate during this period. Therefore, this session is also very important. Although the session is short, we must do our best to contribute our opinions on local political and social trends, as well as the overall national situation.

Finally, he put forward three suggestions based on his personal thoughts: "The municipal government's budget for the 37th year of the Republic [1948] must be submitted during this session. If we wait until the next session in December, it will be too late to submit it to the central government for approval. Therefore, we hope that the municipal government will expedite the preparation of the budget for the next year without increasing the burden on citizens or hindering the work of the municipal government. The council should also review it as soon as possible. The austerity movement should be actively promoted. Looking at the current situation in Shanghai, it is a great crisis. The four supervisory committee members who came to Shanghai to investigate last time expressed their feeling that the extravagance of a few people in Shanghai caused the majority to be unable to live. This statement is worth paying attention to. At the same time, Shanghai is an international city, and foreigners coming to Shanghai often express that China is asking for loans from foreign countries, so why not raise funds from the people of Shanghai themselves? Therefore, the austerity movement has reached a stage where it must be implemented. The central government has not yet determined the status of municipalities directly under the central government. The constitution only states that the autonomy of municipalities directly under the central government will be "separately defined by law." Therefore, we hope that the council will study the autonomous status of municipalities directly under the central government as much as possible and contribute to the central government based on Shanghai's past experience in local autonomy." In addition, he also reported that, as a result of the joint efforts of the municipal government and the council, the central government has given satisfactory answers to the return of enemy and puppet-occupied civil land and property and the organization of a joint power plant, and has sent personnel to begin handling the matter.

### Mayor Wu Predicts and Warns – "The Next Three Months Will Be Even More Difficult" – "Stability" Is the Most Needed at Present

Mayor Wu then delivered a speech, stating: "I said earlier that 1947 would be the most difficult year, but the next three months will be even more difficult. In the past, Shanghai experienced gold rushes, student movements, and other incidents. Fortunately, with the assistance of the Municipal Council, the Party Headquarters, and other relevant parties, we were able to get through them safely. We hope that the next few months will also pass smoothly. However, the most needed thing for Shanghai at present is 'stability.' As for 'stability,' the first is to abide by the law and discipline. Otherwise, difficulties in various matters such as transportation, public security, etc., cannot be resolved. The second is to practice austerity. Austerity can increase production and reduce the use of foreign exchange. The trend of extravagance must be overthrown. We hope that the council will assist in establishing a good social atmosphere."

Councilor Zhan Wen, as a representative of the councilors, also expressed that the council should assist the government in stabilizing society.

### Policy Address

At the first meeting of the fourth session of the Municipal Council, Mayor Wu reported on the administration of the city. In addition to the written report, the mayor also orally elaborated on important points: Regarding civil affairs: the conscription problem is the most important. The central government has stipulated that 3,000 volunteer soldiers should be recruited, which can be completed by the end of this month. Approximately 120,000 people have applied for exemption from military service, and they are currently being reviewed separately. In order to encourage the city's young men to actively enlist, a consolation association has been jointly organized in each district. Police: Fire prevention work is very important, especially since the communists are inciting citizens to commit arson, which should be guarded against. However, the equipment costs are enormous, which is the most difficult thing. Even so, many improvements have already been made. The police pay is too low, and I have tried many times to find a solution, but without success. I hope the council will assist in formulating a uniform subsidy plan. Society: We have always spared no effort in managing prices, and we have tried our best to keep rice, oil, and food from rising. Most of the pork comes from Jiangbei. We are now doing our best to crack down on extortionate taxes, so the source is gradually becoming smoother. At the same time, we are also negotiating with the Central Trust of China to provide loans to meat merchants, so the price of meat has fallen. The Winter Relief Association is about to be established, and we hope that all sectors will provide assistance. Education: The municipal government is determined to handle the issue of collecting tuition fees, and the fee standards will be openly established by all relevant parties; 5.2 billion yuan has now been collected for scholarships for primary and secondary schools, which will be distributed uniformly by the unified committee; for universities, there will be economic canteens, etc. Finance: The main task now is to consolidate tax revenue. Public Works: The soaring prices of construction materials have made it extremely difficult to carry out projects. The seawall project is progressing smoothly. The Pudong Avenue is of great importance, and we hope to complete it. Public Utilities: There is currently a power crisis. Too little power is used in industry, and too much is used in store displays, which is a huge waste. The truck ferry across the river can be completed in October. Land Administration: Regarding the racecourse issue, because there is a legal basis, formal negotiations cannot be conducted. Only informal consultations are being adopted. The other party has now agreed to first study how much land they need there as a minimum before discussing the matter further. Health: The sanitation problem is the biggest.

### Just Discussing Soldiers' Treatment - Suddenly, Women's Cries Heard - Petitioning for Soldiers Occupying Houses Encountered Military Police Harassment and Assault

(Our Report) Yesterday, before the first meeting of the Municipal Council adjourned at noon, while the treatment of soldiers was being hotly debated, a conflict occurred between military police and civilians downstairs, and a pregnant woman was kicked. It turned out that Lin Chunshui and others, representatives of six households living downstairs at No. 18, Nanyongji Lane, Wangzhi Road, came to the Council to petition. They stated that the residents of the building downstairs had a seven-year lease with the landlord, but on the 19th of last month, a soldier named Liu Jimin came and claimed that all the houses downstairs had been taken over by him, forcing them to move out. On the 22nd, Liu occupied the downstairs, forcibly moved the original residents' furniture and objects outside the door, and hung a sign on the door that read "Fourth Warehouse, Engineering Department, United Service Command." This matter has been going on for a month, and the original residents have nowhere to live, so they came to petition, and held a white cloth banner with the words "Soldiers forcibly occupy people's houses, and the common people have no houses to live in. Please uphold justice, Municipal Council." After hearing the news, the Council immediately appointed two councilors, Zhang Xuelian and Shi Zongde, to receive them. At this time, a young military policeman was carrying a large bundle of boots and passed by the area. Seeing the words "Soldiers forcibly occupy people's houses" written on the cloth, he immediately went forward to argue with the petitioners, saying that there were good and bad soldiers and that they should not be generalized, so he accused the petitioning representatives of insult. A conflict broke out immediately, and one of the pregnant women who was petitioning knelt on the ground and pleaded with him. The military policeman kicked her in the abdomen, causing the woman to cry and wail, which immediately aroused public outrage. People pointed out that the military policeman should not hit people, especially not kick a pregnant woman. At that time, several petitioners, together with the duty police officer of the Hongkou Branch, twisted him to the Council to report the incident. The police wanted to take him to the police station, but the military policeman said, "The police can't control the military police." The police officer said, "If you hit someone on the road, you are breaking the law, and this is within my authority." As a result, he was taken to the station to ask for instructions on how to deal with the matter.

(Our Report) The Municipal Council has recently received repeated complaints from citizens that the District Court often has a backlog of cases. Therefore, it has written to the District Court, requesting it to try its best to prevent cases from piling up for a long time. If it is necessary to delay the proceedings, it is hoped that the court will distinguish the importance and urgency of the cases and prioritize them accordingly in order to facilitate the people's lawsuits and protect their legal rights.

### Caohejing's Main Thoroughfare Blocked – Gentry Gather to Discuss Elimination

Caohejing Guanshengyuan Road was widened from an existing highway in the 23rd year of the Republic [1934] at the request of the former Caohejing District Municipal Committee to the Municipal Public Works Bureau, and funds were raised locally to compensate landowners. At that time, Guanshengyuan donated the most money, so the local government requested the Municipal Public Works Bureau to name it Guanshengyuan Road as a reward. Vehicle traffic has always been convenient, and this has lasted for fourteen years. Recently, however, the owner of the bridge abutment came forward to claim ownership and erected stakes and fences in the middle of the road, blocking vehicle traffic. Factories along the road have been greatly affected and have repeatedly reported to the police bureau for elimination, but they have been dismantled and reinstalled repeatedly, and the traffic situation remains blocked.

I started smoking when I was young, and it was my parents' fault. After marrying Tian Guozhen, I quit for a while, but later I had a miscarriage and suffered from stomach problems. I was weak and heard that smoking a few puffs would help." Subsequently, the presiding judge stood up and announced: "Tian Guozhen and Tan are guilty of drug use, violating the drug prohibition laws.

### The Arrest of the Old Headmaster Who Defiled Female Students in Jiangyin – Jiang Ruzhen Attempted to Flee to Northern Jiangsu – His Alias Exposed While Obtaining Documents - Claimed to Have Been Framed by His Mistress

(Our Report) Jiang Ruzhen, 55 years old, from Sanguan Township, Jiangyin, principal of Dewa Primary School on Xicang Road, Nanshi, was wanted by the District Court's Prosecutor's Office for repeatedly raping ten underage female students, including Zhu Yuexian, in June of this year. Jiang fled without a trace after the incident. It turned out that Jiang had been hiding in Zhang Jinhai's home in Sunjia Lane, Cangqian Bridge, his hometown of Jiangyin, several months ago. Zhang was his elder brother, but Jiang Ruzhen had been adopted out when he was young, so he no longer used the Zhang surname. After returning, Jiang planned to go to northern Jiangsu and secretly contacted Hu Qingsheng, the deputy head of Sanguan Township, through his brother, changing his name to Zhang Yinhai and asking him to help him obtain a national ID card. On the 18th of this month, Hu Qingsheng instructed the household registration clerk, Hu Bingyu, to quickly fill out a national ID card for Zhang. Hu saw that he looked flustered and checked the household registration book, but there was no Zhang Yinhai. He secretly informed the township head Hu, who, after investigation, learned that he had changed his name and that he was a wanted criminal. That evening at 10:00 PM, he sent the self-defense team to arrest Jiang. On the 19th, he was handed over to the county government. On the 20th, Magistrate Xu personally interrogated him. Jiang denied raping the female students, only admitting that Huade Primary School was founded by him by renting a house and land, and that he had put in a lot of hard work. Because the school was located near Zhu Hu's house, she was over 40 years old and her husband worked at the Wheel Bureau and only returned once a week. Her daughter, Yuexian, studied at Huade, and he often visited Zhu's house, and he developed an ambiguous relationship with Zhu.

### Mid-Air SOS from Plane: Passengers Prepared to Parachute - Tokyo Flight a False Alarm

[Our Dispatch] The Northwest Airlines "Shanghai" flight, which departed from America via Tokyo for Shanghai, sent an emergency SOS signal at 5:30 PM yesterday, when it was only 50 miles from Shanghai. The China Aviation Corporation (CAC) received the signal, reporting a fire onboard and a critical situation. The pilot had notified passengers to prepare to parachute and escape, requesting CAC to dispatch a rescue plane immediately.

Upon receiving the message, CAC immediately dispatched aircraft ○46, which took off at once. While in the air, they received another telegram from the "Shanghai" flight, stating that the fire had been extinguished and that everything was alright.

At that time, the CAC airport had already prepared fire trucks and ambulances, anticipating potential accidents during the "Shanghai" flight's landing. At 5:40 PM, the "Shanghai" flight landed slowly and safely. After the passengers hurriedly disembarked, the entire aircraft was thoroughly inspected. Not only was there no trace of fire in the passenger cabin, but the cargo hold was also completely normal.

According to the pilot, Bank, the plane's construction included an automatic fire alarm system in the cargo hold. In case of a fire, a red light in the cockpit would automatically illuminate. When the fire was extinguished, the light would automatically go off. Yesterday, while piloting the Shanghai flight 50 miles from Shanghai, he suddenly noticed the warning light in the front cargo hold illuminate. He immediately used the automatic fire extinguisher. Shortly after, the red light went off, indicating that everything was fine. Just as he was celebrating passing a critical moment, the red light in the rear cargo hold also illuminated. Although he used the automatic fire extinguisher again, it was ineffective. He was then forced to send an SOS signal and fly at a low altitude of 300 feet, notifying the passengers to prepare to parachute and escape. At this critical juncture, the warning light in the rear cargo hold also went off, finally putting his mind at ease. He ultimately landed at Longhua Airport. After repeated research and inspection by CAC mechanical personnel, it was discovered that the false alarm was due to a malfunction in the "automatic fire alarm light" itself, causing it to flicker on and off, while there was actually no fire.

There were eleven passengers aboard the flight to Shanghai yesterday, including Mrs. Zhu Shiming, who boarded the plane when it flew through Tokyo. According to accounts of the time, all the passengers on the plane remained calm. Two Filipino flight attendants, upon learning of the matter, could not help but burst out laughing.

Finally, we earnestly hope that readers who care about young people will give them sympathy and help in these short eight days, continuously donating and constantly soliciting donations, until the end of September!

### First Shot in News Industry Rectification Campaign: Six Unscrupulous Reporters in the Capital Accused of Soliciting "Entertainment Fees"

[Our Dispatch from Nanjing, 22nd] Amidst the sounds of rectification in the news industry, the capital has taken concrete action to investigate unscrupulous reporters who extorted money under the guise of collecting fees. This matter was revealed in the newspapers on the 20th and has temporarily come to an end on the 22nd. People in the capital's news industry are paying close attention to this matter. It is said that the Reporters Association will soon make a decision, taking it as the first shot in the rectification campaign.

Recently, a resident of Nanjing, Liu Zhennan, committed suicide in front of the house of his enemy Lan Shichang. That afternoon, several reporters went to Lan's house to interview him, claiming that the reports in the newspapers did not match the facts and that Lan needed to provide entertainment fees to the news industry. They extorted 12 million yuan, which was eventually reduced to 3 million yuan. However, another reporter learned of this matter, and the Zongheng News Agency in the city issued a press release on the 19th, detailing the matter. The Central Daily News published it first on the 20th. The leaders of the Capital Reporters Association, the Capital Communications Industry Association, and various newspapers and news agencies in the city attached great importance to the matter and decided to send personnel to

Investigate the Truth

On the afternoon of the 21st, seven major newspapers in the capital sent personnel to jointly investigate, and the truth was gradually revealed. The seven reporters who participated in the joint investigation were Hu Xiaoxian of the Central Daily News, Zhou Xiying of the Peace Daily News, Qian Shaofang of the New People's News, Zhang Gongdu of the Dagang News, Peng Yimin of the Social Daily News, Bai Yaoxi of the Construction Daily News, and Lu Xu of the Nanjing People's News. They were ordered to visit Lan's house on the 21st and invite the complainant to talk to them. They learned the entire story and collectively wrote a report that evening, which was published in various newspapers on the 22nd. According to the

Collective Report

The complainant was Lang Wenzong, a news provider for Zongheng News Agency. He said that a total of six reporters participated in the extortion. According to Lan's second daughter, five of them were Shi Shaofang, a reporter for the social news agency, Xia Qingyun, a reporter for the Construction Daily News, Le Boyuan, a reporter for the Social Daily News, Cao Weiquan, a reporter for the Capital Evening News and the Datong News Agency, and Chen Jishen, a reporter for the Peace Daily News. Another person is still unknown. Lang said: "According to my investigation, Chen was wronged because he was dragged along by others, and I don't think he would do such a thing."

According to the collective report, Cao, Xia, and Le visited Lan Shichang first. Le also invited Lan to talk to him at the Social Daily News, advising Lan to entertain the reporters the next day. The next day, they repeatedly contacted

Lan's Daughter

and classmates, demanding fees for entertaining the reporters and ordering coffee, toast, and dinner. The Lans knew their intentions and thought their character was questionable, so they planned to ignore them. Later, "various inaccurate and distorted reports appeared in various small newspapers." At this time, Lang Wenzong went to interview and learned the truth. Lang claimed to be a representative of the Rectification Committee of the Capital Reporters Association to investigate and obtained the above list, publishing the matter in the newspapers.

Now that the truth of the matter has been clarified, people in the news industry have decided to express their opinions. It is said that the Capital Reporters Association plans to

Expel Membership

of the reporters involved in the incident as a show of rectification. However, Chen Jishen of the Peace Daily News, one of the five mentioned above, applied to the newspaper for temporary resignation when the matter was widely rumored. He said that he was falsely accused this time, and the truth will soon be revealed. To show his self-responsibility, he intends to ask for temporary resignation to await the investigation and resolve the matter according to law, in order to achieve the purpose of rectifying the news industry.

As the reporter was writing this, it was learned that the relevant newspapers had taken

Appropriate Measures

for the unscrupulous news extortion case in the capital. Xia Biaoyun of the Construction Daily News and Sang Boyuan of the Social Daily News have been suspended from their positions by the newspaper authorities and are awaiting legal resolution. The identity of Cao Weiquan, a reporter for the Datong News Agency in the Capital Evening News, is still questionable. The Datong News Agency said that Cao was not a reporter for the agency, while the Capital Evening News said that there was Cao Chao, not Cao Weiquan. Tang Wenlan, president of the Capital Evening News, believes that Lang Wenzong and the newspapers that published the matter on the 22nd slandered the newspaper and should bear legal responsibility. Chen Jishen of the Peace Daily News said that he knew nothing about the extortion. In addition to clarifying his position to the Reporters Association, Chen intends to sue Lang Wenzong for defamation. The Social News Agency believes that Shi Shaofang is a special reporter for the agency, and Shi is outside using the agency's name to swagger around and violate the law. He will be subject to legal sanctions. It is also heard that Cao Weiquan and Le Boyuan also intend to sue Lang Wenzong.

[Our Dispatch from Nanjing, 22nd] In order to implement the rectification of the news industry, the Capital Reporters Association decided to organize a Rectification Committee. Ma Xingye, president of the Central Daily News, was the convener. Ma resigned due to being busy. The Organization Group of the Association was designated to be responsible for convening. The group believed that this matter was related to the reputation of all members. In addition to sending personnel to investigate the truth and correct public perception, they specially formulated reward and complaint methods and announced their implementation to prevent similar incidents from happening again in the future. The methods stipulate:

Any member of this association who is responsible for protecting the reputation of the group and complains about unscrupulous colleagues will be given a certificate of honor by this association after the association's investigation confirms the facts, and it will be awarded in a public ceremony.

Any person from all walks of life who is responsible for complaining about unscrupulous reporters will be given a bonus by this association after the association's investigation confirms the facts. The amount is the sum of three to six months of all salaries and allowances of the person being complained about, depending on the severity of the circumstances. It will be deducted from the service unit of the person being complained about and sent to the association for distribution.

The term "responsible" in the preceding paragraph refers to the complainant listing their real name, address, and position, and signing and sealing the document, detailing the facts of the complaint. If the complaint is made on the basis of personal grievances and is false, the complainant shall also bear legal responsibility.

All complaint letters should be sent to the Organization Group of the Reporters Association, and this association will absolutely keep the secrets of the complainants.

### Armed Member of Changzhou Self-Defense Force Shoots and Kills Innocent Civilian, Falsely Claims to Have Killed Water Monster

[News from Changzhou, 20th] Hutangqiao in this county is a large town in the south gate area. There is a Jianguo Grand Theater in the town. Recently, the weather has been fine, and Changzhou Tanhuang opera is being performed. Wang Runhai, an armed member of the town's self-defense force, argued with Zhang Jinda, a villager who was watching the opera, over seats. Wang Runhai was originally a local hooligan. During the enemy puppet period, he served as a secret agent under the traitors Jiang Dingsheng and Yin Liangcheng. After the victory, he managed to become an armed member of the team. However, he remained aggressive and evil, not breaking away from his enemy puppet style. He felt that Zhang Jinda had caused him to lose face by arguing with him over seats. He immediately shouted at his accomplices to drag Zhang Jinda out and beat him. Zhang, fearing for his life, ran across the river. Wang Runhai drew his pistol and shot him dead. He then reported to the district office that he had killed a water monster. Public opinion was outraged. A report was made to the court for inspection. On the 19th, Prosecutor Li Yulong of the court went to the countryside and verified that Zhang had indeed been shot to death. The villagers believed that Zhang Jinda had died unjustly and demanded redress. Prosecutor Li arrested Wang Runhai and detained him pending trial.

### Explanation by the Ministry of Justice Regarding Lawsuit Against Prosecutor

The Jiangsu High Court submitted the matter to the Ministry of Justice for clarification, which indicated that the prosecutor's litigation costs should be borne as follows: When a prosecutor is sued and appears in court, his seat is the same as that of the defendant's lawyer.

### The Last Days of the Arch-Traitor Ye Peng

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 17th] Since the victory, great traitors have been arrested and sentenced one by one. The government enforces the law strictly and impartially, which is a most gratifying thing. The arch-traitor Ye Peng, who entrenched himself in Wuhan during the period of occupation, was executed by shooting in Nanjing yesterday morning at 9:30 AM. This arch-traitor met his end on the morning of the 16th anniversary of the "September 18th" National Humiliation Day, which is very heartening and satisfying. At 8:40 AM, the court declared: "The traitor Ye Peng colluded with the enemy, betrayed the country, and plotted to resist this nation. He is sentenced to death." After hearing the verdict, Ye tried to appear calm, repeatedly saying: "It's nothing," "It doesn't matter," only requesting to read the contents of the Chairman's handwritten order. He seemed a little flustered, and his speech was somewhat hesitant. He asked the court if he could say a few words. The court told him to keep it brief.

He said that his death must be due to someone's machinations. He also said: For the sake of his old mother, he did not flee Wuhan and had no choice but to go to Hong Kong. Before going to Hong Kong, he had no thought of things like the "Yan Telegram." Later, he pretended to be "generous" and said: I fought on the front lines, and I am not afraid of death. Everyone has to die, so what is there to fear? Otherwise, I would not be a soldier. Finally, he also said: Although I am ending up this way, I still hope for national unity and the stability of people's lives, and I wish Chairman Chiang good health." At this point, Ye turned around and cast a look at all the listeners, as if seeking sympathy. He issued his last plea before death: Here, there are no outsiders, all "old comrades." I hope everyone will not publicize me as a "traitor," and do not refer to me as a "traitor" in the newspapers! I have no will. My family is all in Shanghai. I hope everyone can sympathize with this request of mine!" At this moment, he seemed to have endless feelings about death.

At 9:10 AM, he was taken to a large truck and driven to the new execution ground at Tianjie Temple outside Zhonghua Gate. He arrived at 9:25 AM. After getting out of the truck, Ye extended his slightly trembling hand and shook hands with the execution supervisor, Chief Luo, and others one by one, repeatedly saying: "There's no way!" "There's no way!" At 9:30 AM, he walked into the execution ground. Just as he was about to turn around and take one last look, the gunshots rang out. The first two shots missed the vital points. The third shot entered from the back and exited from the lower part of the right lung. Ye fell to the ground, his intestines also spilling out, and his whole body spasmed and twitched incessantly. Three minutes later, he breathed his last and died. (Special Correspondent Ding Kuanghua)

### Frenzied Purchase of Horse Racing Tickets in Hong Kong, Awaiting the Chance to Gamble a Fortune [Hong Kong Dispatch via Airmail from Our Correspondent, 16th]

Happy Valley is stepping up its renovation work in preparation to welcome those who come there to "gamble a fortune."

The Hong Kong police detectives have repeatedly strengthened their forces, and purchased radio patrol cars, and regularly dispatch personnel to patrol the city, to quickly prevent and stop events that violate public order.

### All Five Proposals Successfully Passed; National Textile Federation Meeting Concludes; Emergency Motion Requests Government Not to Passively Limit Prices

[Our Dispatch] The second general meeting of members of the Textile Federation opened at 10:00 AM yesterday, presided over by Mr. Shu. First, the persons in charge of the engineering and business departments of the Textile Construction Company reported. The current difficulties in textile construction and engineering are summarized as follows: There are not enough parts, and the factories received are mostly Japanese style. Before the war, Japan had 15 million spindles. Currently, only 2.8 million spindles are in operation. There are many surplus parts, so it is hoped that assistance can be obtained from Japan in the future. There is insufficient electricity, so the direct and indirect losses suffered by the factories are large. Regarding raw materials, the textile construction mills mainly spin yarns of 10 counts or more, so the raw materials rely entirely on imported cotton. It is hoped that the import quota can be increased. In terms of business, the main tasks are to supply civilian needs and regulate the prices of yarn and cloth. The methods have been changed repeatedly, but the purpose remains unchanged. Efforts are also being made to obtain foreign exchange. Exports of yarn and cloth have obtained US$4.6 million and £1.6 million. In the future, it is hoped that private yarn factories will cooperate to strengthen foreign sales. After the report, the proposals were discussed and passed, totaling 72 proposals from the meeting affairs, raw materials, production, sales, economic, and administrative groups. All proposals were successfully passed based on the review reports.

### Temporary Motions

At this time, the representatives present proposed three urgent temporary motions: Representative Liu Guojun proposed opposing the agricultural market's cotton purchasing plan, believing this action exceeded the responsibilities of the Agricultural Bank and was intended to compete with yarn factories. After discussion, it was passed. Twenty people including Shi Fengxiang, Pan Yangshan, and Wang Zhuyi proposed a motion suggesting the government should insist during peace talks with Japan on revising Japan's industrial level requirements, demanding compensation for spindles, and declaring the right to veto. After discussion, it was passed, and the assembly sent telegrams to the Executive Yuan, Ministry of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Political Council. Liu Wensheng proposed a motion suggesting the government should swiftly rescue the economic crisis, promptly reorganize the currency system, and not only implement passive price control policies to avoid affecting production. The motion was passed after deliberation.

### Assembly Declaration

After the proposals were discussed, the chairman announced the Assembly Declaration on the spot. The election of the next term of directors and supervisors was still counting votes yesterday. The list of candidates will be officially announced today, with a quota of 31 people. At about six o'clock, the assembly successfully concluded. The full text of the assembly declaration is recorded below:

### Large Investors Rush to Buy, Most Chinese Stocks Hit Limit Up

The buying interest was especially strong in the afternoon. Nine out of ten stocks successively rose to the limit. After Yongsheng Yarn hit the limit, it also had a premium of two yuan. Comparing the afternoon closing results with last Saturday's closing, for stocks delivered immediately, Yongsheng Yarn, Xinnuo, Meiya, Huafeng Underwear, and Rongfeng each rose by half a percent; Xinguang, Zifu, Zhongfa, and Xinhua rose slightly; Qinxing rose by one percent; Guohuo Cement hit the limit down, but the latter rebounded after hitting the limit, recovering to half a percent lower.

Xinguang Capital Increase, Three Premium Rights

"Xinguang Underwear" shareholder meeting yesterday approved the capital increase and premium plan. It is planned to increase the capital to 26.6 billion national currency, with each old share entitled to subscribe for six new shares. Among them, three shares are calculated at 30 national currency yuan, which will be prepaid by the board of directors. The remaining three shares can be paid in cash by the shareholders. Starting today, the company has designated more than a dozen banks and firms, including Zhejiang Industrial, Zhejiang Xingye, and Four Lines Savings Bank, to collect capital increase payments, with a deadline of seven days (payments can be made at the company at No. 27 Chongqing South Road on holidays).

The cotton spinning industry in our country has a history of 60 years and is a national industry with a relatively solid foundation. Examining the industrial evolution of advanced countries, the textile industry is the foundation for everything. Therefore, this assembly has been meeting for three consecutive days. After careful research, it is the consensus that we should not only awaken the attention of people from all walks of life across the country, but also encourage the concerted efforts of practitioners in this industry to shoulder the heavy responsibility together, complete the goal of ten million spindles according to Chairman Chiang's instructions, alleviate the panic of the people at home in terms of clothing, and compete for the international trade market. However, this cannot be achieved overnight, and we must advance simultaneously in three aspects: cultivating talents, manufacturing machinery ourselves, and promoting raw materials to achieve self-reliance. In addition, we should also strive to improve production efficiency, reduce manufacturing costs, and standardize quality standards. However, the success of a business must first have sufficient conditions for survival before development can be considered. Practitioners in this industry must make due efforts, and the government and people from all walks of life in society must also provide strong assistance so that success can be achieved with half the effort, and national economy and people's livelihood can benefit each other. As the assembly closes, we hereby reveal the above three points to encourage people across the country.

Chinese stocks were sluggish yesterday but suddenly became popular. Buying momentum started, and large investors chased after them. There were widespread rumors of reduced margin requirements, and popular stocks rose sharply, especially Meiya, which rose the fastest. Stocks can be paid in cash by the shareholders. Starting today, the company has designated more than a dozen banks and firms, including Zhejiang Industrial, Zhejiang Xingye, and Four Lines Savings Bank, to collect capital increase payments, with a deadline of seven days (payments can be made at the company at No. 27 Chongqing South Road on holidays).

Fortunately, all sectors of society will not be misled.

### Reader Consultation Legal Interpretation

Disputes Arise from Clearing Debts from Ten Years Ago

An Interlude in the Changing Value of Currency

Dear Editor: A borrowed 200 legal currency from his close friend B in the 26th year of the Republic of China and made a contract. It was stated that it would be paid off within three years, without interest. Now party A wants to repay the money and take back the contract, but party B insists that the legal currency has depreciated and must be calculated according to the proportion of rice prices. In this way, the repayment will be tens of thousands of times more than the original amount, which party A considers too large and cannot afford. Mediation has been ineffective. Now there are several questions, please answer, Is it necessary to calculate the loan of the Republic of China in the 25th year today? Is there any express provision, How is the legal depreciation rate of the legal currency, Is it legal to repay the original 200 yuan with 300,000 yuan today, Are there any precedents in similar disputes in the High Court, and what is the judgment?

[Lawyer Cao Yaxia answers] There is no express provision, but the court may be requested to fairly weigh the increase or decrease in payment in accordance with the provisions of Article 12 of the Supplementary Rules for Handling Civil Litigation after Restoration. The law does not recognize it, and there is no statutory depreciation rate. It is originally legal, but the creditor may sue the court for a ruling if he thinks it is obviously unfair. There is no precedent in the Supreme Court. The disposal of the court varies from place to place. According to what the answerer knows, in Shanghai, there have been precedents of paying back bank deposits before the war at 2,000 times and 4,000 times. However, the Zhejiang High Court ruled in the case of Zhang Shipei's appeal in Jiaxing. Zhang borrowed 250 legal currencies from his friend Zhang Zhaozong in the 28th year of the Republic of China. It was impossible to recover the money during the war. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, after repeated negotiations, the opinions of the parties were not close, resulting in litigation. Initially, the local court ruled that the defendant should repay 1,000 times. The plaintiff refused to accept the appeal and was sentenced to pay 10,000 times.

### Fifteen Japanese War Criminals Innocent

— Chi Fu

On the eve of the second anniversary of Japan's surrender and signing, General MacArthur announced another "benevolent government" for Japan. That is the United Press International's August 31 Tokyo telegram: "Five former Japanese cabinet members, including one admiral, one false army general, one leader of the zaibatsu, and ten other major war criminals who have not yet been tried, were released from Sugamo Prison on the 30th."

When these war criminals were released from prison, they asked the prison authorities one after another: "Released! Is it really true?" Everyone was overjoyed and thanked General MacArthur's holy virtue.

When the news spread to the world, everyone was half believing and half doubting. Believing was MacArthur's arbitrariness and his policy of indulging Japan, there must be such a thing, but indulging too much and it was not the right time; doubting was that the "spirit" of the Potsdam Declaration was not to be destroyed by the defeated countries, and not to be destroyed by the United Nations, but by the unilateral destruction of the United States. In the future peace conference with Japan, how will the Allied countries speak? How will the terms of the future peace treaty with Japan be written? It's really puzzling.

To be fair, General MacArthur's release of this group of war criminals was indeed a wrong measure, and people of the Allied countries should protest! In particular, the Allied prosecutor (the Chinese prosecutor is Xiang Zhejun) announced that this group of war criminals would not be prosecuted, which is extremely absurd, and people of the supervisory countries should protest! Now we introduce the resumes of this group of "innocent" invaders, and let fair readers judge:

Ayukawa Yoshisuke Japan's top chaebol is the industrial dictator of "Manchukuo", former president of Japan Sishi, member of the House of Peers. He is the mastermind of "Manchuria's" economic invasion, the mainstream of Japan's military-industrial production

Kobayashi Jizo Active Admiral, former Vice Minister of the Navy, Commander of the Combined Fleet, Governor of Taiwan, Chairman of the Central Cooperation Council, Zeng Zhengzeng Director, former Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Koiso Cabinet. During her tenure as Governor of Taiwan, she used Taiwan as a base to invade China and the Pacific. She is the soul of the Japanese Navy.

Masaki Jinzaburo Reserve Army General, Military Councilor. She is the leader of the "February 26 Incident", the fierce faction of the early "young" Japanese, and has created many incidents, all of which are related to launching aggression.

Murata Shozo Former Minister of Communications in the Kondo Cabinet, Ambassador to the Philippine puppet government during the Pacific War.

Otatsu Shigeo Former Minister of Home Affairs in the Tojo Cabinet, Mayor of "Shonan" (Singapore) during the Pacific War, and tried to eliminate British influence.

Sakai Tadamasa Former Minister of Agriculture and Forestry in the Abe Cabinet.

Matsuzaka Zheng Former Minister of Justice in the Tojo Cabinet.

Okabe Nagakage Former Minister of Education in the Tojo Cabinet.

Ota Kozo Former professor of Hosei University, Director-General of the Taisei Yokosankai, served as Minister of Education.

Shoriki Matsutaro Former President of Tokyo Yomiuri Shimbun, she is the spokesperson of the Japanese military department, the publisher of the newspaper that has the strongest support for secondary aggression

Kobayashi Junichiro Former Director-General of the Taisei Yokosankai, she is a colonel.

Kikuchi Takeo She is a member of the House of Peers who was born as a lieutenant general. She is an extreme "patriot" and the most vocal person attacking the "Emperor Organ Theory".

Okura Kunihiko She is the founder of the Okura Institute of Mental Science and the president of the Shanghai Tongwen Hospital of Toyo University. She is a powerful supporter of the "spiritual science" of Japanese aggression. Many Japanese executives who ruled the "Wang regime" were her students.

Shindo Kazuma President of the "Genyosha", the leader of Japanese theocracy and all reactionary elements.

Ida Keinan Former member of the House of Peers, leader of extreme "patriotism"

### The Positive Effect of Hot Water Bags

In the minds of American writers, Chinese women have extraordinary wisdom. They use the rubber bags commonly found in hospitals as hand warmers, and for a period of time, it became a trend. Almost all women have a bag in their hearts, and the colors of the bags are also divided into gold, silver, red, gray, green, pink, etc., plus a square silk handkerchief, just like icing on the cake. American women would never think so thoughtfully and fascinatingly. The original function of the warm bag is to dispel pain from tumors in the hospital. If you have a tumor in any part of your body, the doctor will give you a rubber bag filled with warm water and apply it to the affected area several times a day. After three to five days, the swelling will subside and the pain will stop. If you feel uncomfortable with hot water in summer, you can switch to ice water. Ice water has the same anti-swelling effect. This treatment is extremely popular in Chinese folk customs, but there are no hot water bags in the countryside. They use a spatula for cooking. They heat the spatula in a pot and gently strike the affected area several times a day. After striking, the patient feels scorched and uncomfortable, and after striking a few times, the swelling and pain will be relieved. This folk method is considered superstitious by Chinese-style Western doctors. How can a knife cure the disease? In fact, it is not the knife that cures the disease, but the heat. When American exporters packed a large number of hot water bags to China, the American medical community was greatly surprised when they saw the number of hot water bags exported in the export goods. They thought that Chinese medicine had developed so rapidly, and so many hot water bags were used, and other sanitary products could be imagined. Later, they specially sent several medical authorities to China to investigate hygiene undertakings and found that Chinese women all carried a hot water bag, and they couldn't help laughing to themselves. After returning to the United States, one of the authorities wrote a wonderful book, praising the intelligence of Chinese women. There are many clever things Chinese people do, such as tightening the legs of the quilt cover to hold rice, using the bathtub as a boat, Nanjing people modified the three-wheeled machine foot road army into an eight-seater passenger car, using firecrackers as DDT, pasting movie newspapers on walls, and using banknotes to light cigarettes, all of which are creative and economical.

The above figures were all arrested by General MacArthur after September 12, 1945. After two years without trial, the prosecutor of the Far East International Military Tribunal announced that they were "innocent" and released. Is it reasonable? Let the readers judge!

### The Japanese People Discuss MacArthur

— Translated by Bao Zhongqi

[Translator's Note] An American magazine reporter interviewed Japanese people, asking, "What is your impression of MacArthur?" Their answers were almost uniformly praising MacArthur first, then lamenting their suffering to gain the sympathy and aid of Americans. The cunning Japanese people!

Student: Most Japanese people believe that the current military control is beneficial to our country. MacArthur is a genius, and you Americans should support him. Unfortunately, the food supply is poor. This year is a matter of life and death. There is a lack of housing. You will often find five or six families living in one room.

Hotel Clerk: Every Japanese person thinks MacArthur is a good man. We have hope and hope that your army will continue to stay here until the Japanese can be self-sufficient. First, you must help us eliminate the black market. Everything is too expensive. The value of sugar has exceeded that of jewels.

Travel Agent: All Japanese people are extremely pleased that you sent MacArthur to our country. The Soviet Union would not treat me so kindly. We hope that Americans will sponsor us to restore our pre-war state. Food and clothing are insufficient except when obtained through the black market.

Newspaper Boy: Prices are too high. I hope this is the peak. However, American officials treat me so kindly. I am willing to work for them. I hope I can meet MacArthur.

Grocery Store Owner: Living conditions are better than a year ago. Food is still lacking, and so is clothing. A year ago, we had nothing. MacArthur gave people jobs. We urgently need free trade. We love and need America.

Jeweler: I want to see prices drop. Under military control, the general situation is better. I understand Americans. I have been trading with them for twenty years. They are good people, just like MacArthur. I hope to be able to trade freely again immediately. Japan needs it.

Merchant: National expenditure is three to four hundred times higher than before the war. We hope you can stay here until we can be self-sufficient. We fear the Soviet Union. We need MacArthur's protection. He will prevent the Soviet Union from repeating on our country what it did to European countries.

Old Bookstore Owner: Living conditions are very bad. The black market is causing us to struggle painfully. We need more help. We need America. Only MacArthur can satisfy the inadequate strength of our government.

### Please Postpone the Dancing Ban

— Li Ling

Dancing, in civilized countries in Europe and America, is originally a proper form of entertainment and common social activity between men and women. However, like an orange north of the Huai River turning into a bitter orange, once it comes to China, it changes its nature, becoming a profession that allows those pitiful people struggling on the brink of starvation to survive. The reason for this change in nature need not be concealed; it is a serious problem of the current society that is not simple. The change in the nature of dancing is just a subtle manifestation of the society’s unhealthy phenomena.

Is the reason why dance hostesses are dance hostesses because they willingly use their physical appearance to gain the favor of young masters? Are they willingly degenerate and refuse to engage in productive work? When we look around, the young men and women who are unemployed upon graduation have the ambition and intention to participate in productive work, to serve the country and society, and to strive for their own future. However, the productive sectors of society are currently too few. Even this group of pure and promising young men and women with knowledge cannot be accommodated, let alone our group of dance hostesses and practitioners who lack production skills, insufficient intelligence, and inadequate ability.

Some people say, "The life of a dance hostess is too extravagant." This is a fact that we do not deny. However, extravagant dance hostesses are actually only a minority. More than ninety percent of us engage in the dance industry at night and take care of household chores during the day. Those with children also have to take care of their children and bear the double burden of being a housewife and a working woman. If one only sees the few extravagant dance hostesses and assumes that all dance hostesses are extravagant, that is tantamount to saying, "Schools ask for money, so education is undesirable."

Banning dancing will not only increase the number of unemployed people in Shanghai by more than 20,000 but will also exacerbate the unemployment problem that society urgently needs to solve but cannot. As the ancient saying goes, "Only when clothing and food are sufficient can one know honor and shame." If society truly had a way to maintain our livelihood, the government would not need to ban dancing, and we would automatically change our profession. Conversely, even if the government orders a ban on dancing, it will only create the tragic fate of more than 20,000 people in reality! We hope that the wise government will postpone the implementation of the ban, allowing us a chance to catch our breath and change our profession at ease. (Note: Ms. Li is one of the directors of the Shanghai Dance Hostess Association.)

### "Free Talk" Over Thirty-Six Years

— Zheng Fan

From April 1, the ninth year of the Republic of China, to November 30, the twenty-first year of the Republic of China, this considerably long period of twelve years was hosted by Zhou Shoujuan. Those who wrote for "Free Talk" were all the famous so-called "Saturday School" literati of the time in Shanghai. The content was nothing more than "talking about love," "romanticizing nature," and "broadly discussing various topics." At one point, the pages were divided into categories such as "Idle Talk," "Miscellany," "Miscellaneous Things Heard," "Travel Notes," "Drama Talk," "Leftovers," and "Trivia." In addition, lengthy serialized chapters of novels and anecdotes about the literary scene never ceased.

This style did not undergo a sudden change until Li Liewen took over "Free Talk" at the end of the twenty-first year, and the one who inherited this mantle was the newly created "Spring and Autumn Supplement," still hosted by Zhou Shoujuan.

The period when Li Liewen edited "Free Talk," although only a short year and five months, broke through the past style of "Free Talk," writing in another direction, deeply influencing the literary youth of the time. At that time, it was indeed a "Free Talk" and also an important page in the modern Chinese literary history!

At that time, Mr. Liang Cai, the general manager of this newspaper's history, was actively improving the newspaper. Coincidentally, Li Liewen had just returned from France, and he was hired to the newspaper to edit "Free Talk." Li's first shot after taking over was to cut off the serialized novel "The Crossroads of the Times and Love" by Zhang Ziping. Zhang Ziping's novel therefore declined greatly in popularity. Li Liewen completely turned "Free Talk" into a base for new literature, and almost all of the first-class writers in China at the time were captured by "Free Talk." Those who regularly contributed included Lu Xun, Yu Dafu, Mao Dun, Lao She, etc. At the same time, because he paid attention to essays, he promoted many new writers, such as Kang Qiang and Kong Lingjing.

Precisely because the writing of "Free Talk" at that time had an explosive nature, an announcement was finally posted, "Allowed to Talk About Love Affairs," and the style became slightly more bland, but the writers were still the original team. Among them, Lu Xun used many pen names due to special relationships. The more commonly used ones were "He Jia Gan," "Leisure," "Congee," "Lühua," and "Luo Wen." Later, because it was inconvenient for him to come forward himself, he simply wrote articles, asked people to copy them, and added a pen name, so even the editors were deceived. These texts were later included by Lu Xun in "False Freedom Book," "Allowed Love Affairs Talk," and "Fringe Literature."

During that time, there were several major debates, such as the problem of students reading Zhuangzi's selected works, the problem of mass language, and even the problem of humor and the problem of sons-in-law, all of which were very famous and can be seen in everyone's essays.

In May of the twenty-third year, Li resigned and was succeeded by Zhang Zisheng (May 9), returning from splendor to plainness until the cessation of publication on November 1 of the twenty-fourth year.

During the Anti-Japanese War, the Shenbao was once moved to Hankou and Hong Kong for publication. "Free Talk" was also published some of the time during the year or so in Hong Kong. In the tenth month of the twenty-seventh year of the Republic of China, the Shenbao was republished in Shanghai, and "Free Talk" was hosted by "Wang Renshu," still with a "Lu Xun style."

Soon, Hu Shanyuan changed the editorship, and the writers were mostly young literati, such as Ding Di and Wen Zongshan, and the style became even more bland. After more than a year, Huang Jiayin edited it, specializing in Western essays and scientific interest, with the same style as his Western Breeze Magazine.

Thus, until December 8 of the thirty-first year, the Pacific War broke out, and the newspaper was suspended.

After the victory, the Shenbao gloriously resumed publication in Shanghai. "Free Talk" was initially edited by Huang Jiayin, and in May of last year, it was edited by Bu Shaofu, the deputy editor-in-chief of this newspaper. In February of this year, Qian Taisheng took over the editorship and has continued until now.

There is no need to say more about everything concerning "Free Talk" at present. One point to add here is that "Free Talk" was originally a garden for new literature, but after the victory, it was transplanted to "Spring and Autumn." "Free Talk" specializes in newsy, educational, scientific, knowledge-based, and interesting essays. As mentioned above, although the style and content of "Free Talk" have changed repeatedly, there is only one principle: it is always a truly "Free Talk," free and unrestrained, without prejudice or restraint!
