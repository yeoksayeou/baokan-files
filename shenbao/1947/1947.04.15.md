The deputy stepped down from the reviewing stand, boarded a jeep, with Chief of Staff Chen sitting in the back, the car was driven by a Youth Army officer, and adjutant Yang Fengzao, and another Youth Army officer also sat along. The Chairman stood in the car, and amidst the sound of military music, inspected the ranks. Commander Xuan and other officers followed in four jeeps.

After the review, the Chairman returned to the reviewing stand to address all the officers and soldiers. At that time, Chief of Staff Chen stood to the Chairman's left, and the guests stood in a row on the right.

In his address to the Youth Army, the Chairman first explained that the purpose of the National Revolution was to implement the Three Principles of the People of the founding father of the nation and build a prosperous and happy new China. Revolutionary soldiers should ensure the freedom and equality of the nation and the people under the leadership of the Three Principles of the People, so that they would be worthy of being followers of the founding father and descendants of the Yellow Emperor. The Chairman then encouraged the Youth Army soldiers in the camp to strictly abide by discipline, obey orders, be autonomous, self-governing, self-reliant, and self-strengthening, so that they would be worthy of being sound soldiers. To the demobilized Youth Army cadres, he instructed them to adhere to the spirit of sacrifice, stick to their posts, work hard, implement the livelihood principle, and build a new national society, so that they would be worthy of being free and independent citizens.

After leaving Zhongzheng Park at 11:20 a.m., the Chairman went to the Central Training Corps Shanghai Branch to inspect and addressed all the officers and officials of the police officer class.

### Chief of Staff Chen's Speech

After the Chairman left, Chief of Staff Chen continued to address all the officers and soldiers, saying: "After Japan surrendered, in order to seek peaceful unification and build a prosperous and happy country, the Central Government spared no effort to tolerate and concede to the Communist Party in the hope of achieving this goal, but the more the Central Government endured, the more arrogant the Communist Party became, not only refusing peace talks, but also refusing to recognize the Constitution and the Central Government. In recent months, they have launched a full-scale military offensive, and the government has no choice but to fight back. Also, because the only method the Communist Party uses towards the people is deception, the people in all the areas that have been occupied by the Communist army hate them bitterly. Therefore, we must help the people organize themselves and select revolutionary comrades to take on the work of organizing the people, so that the people will no longer fear the Communist bandits.

You are revolutionary cadres, and the Chairman has already entrusted us with a major mission.

Today our responsibility is too heavy, we must shoulder this responsibility: (1) eliminate bandits, (2) strengthen production, solve people's livelihood, (3) do not become the object of revolution. Finally, please note that before the Japanese enemy surrendered, we could not come to this park. Now, under the leadership of the Chairman, we have defeated the Japanese army and abolished the unequal treaties, so this park is renamed Zhongzheng Park. Today we can gather here is something to be proud of, but the revolution has not yet succeeded, and it is hoped that we can complete the task of the National Revolution in our hands, and when that time comes, it will be even more enjoyable to gather here again."

### Regarding the Issue of Convening a Peace Conference with Germany; Foreign Minister Wang's Solemn Statement; Demands Strict Implementation of the Potsdam Agreement

[Report from this newspaper, Nanjing, 14th] Foreign Minister Wang Shijie issued the following statement on the issue of the peace conference with Germany on the 14th: "How should the peace conference with Germany be convened? Which country should convene it? And which countries can participate? All these issues should be decided by the Council of Foreign Ministers of the five countries. No member of the council has the prerogative to decide this issue. Any decision that is not generated by the Council of Foreign Ministers as a whole would be an ultra vires act in terms of the organizational rules of the Council of Foreign Ministers and would violate the Potsdam Agreement establishing the Council of Foreign Ministers. I have repeatedly notified the four foreign ministers meeting in Moscow of the Chinese government's position. My action is not to ask them to give me any extra-legal concessions, but only to demand the strict implementation of the Potsdam Agreement. The foreign ministers of France, the United Kingdom, and the United States have accepted my view in their replies to me and have stated that they will insist on their position, while the Soviet foreign minister has not yet adopted the same view. I believe that if there is a dispute over the meaning of the organizational rules of the Council of Foreign Ministers, the opinion that should be respected should naturally be the opinion of the majority, not the opinion of the minority. The Treaty of Peace with Germany is one of the most important issues in world peace. The Chinese government not only believes that China must bear a share of the responsibility for convening the peace conference with Germany, but also believes that the organization of this peace conference must be expanded as much as possible so that all countries participating in the war against Germany have the right to attend the peace conference, and so that their general opinions can receive greater attention than at the Paris Peace Conference last year. China has not yet accepted the proposal of the foreign ministers of the four drafting countries to provide opinions on the German peace treaty. Until the issue of convening the peace conference with Germany is properly resolved, the Chinese government will reserve the freedom of all its future actions."

### Differing Attitudes on Japanese Reparations Issue; Government Quietly Awaits Disposition by Allied Headquarters

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 14th] Attitudes towards the issue of reparations from Japan vary among different parties. The government remains calm and awaits disposition by the Allied Headquarters. The Communist Party fiercely opposes the early removal of machinery. The Liberal Party hopes that the machinery will not be removed and that manufactured goods will be used as reparations. Although newspapers have published detailed news on reparations, most editorials remain silent. Recently, only the Mainichi Shimbun expressed its support for early removal of reparations "to end the anxious and suspicious state of the industry and enable it to understand its situation and plan future activities." The Democratic Party and the National Cooperative Party have responded positively. The Liberal Party expressed the hope that Japan can retain its machinery and factories and use manufactured goods as reparations. The Communist Party fiercely opposes early removal, saying that it will make Japan's post-war industry greatly difficult and aggravate the unemployment problem. They advocate that "reparations should continue until Japan can become industrially self-reliant again." The Japanese government has little to say about this and is now quietly awaiting orders from the Allied Headquarters."

This aroused public outrage among the workers of the printing and newspaper delivery industries and all reporters. More than 200 people gathered at 2:00 PM to petition the court. Public sentiment reached a boiling point. Chief Prosecutor Ma personally promised to immediately order the arrest of the perpetrators and handle the matter severely in accordance with the law, after which the crowd dispersed. At 4:00 PM, the two industries resolved to suspend operations immediately. At 9:00 PM, the reporter, newspaper delivery, and printing groups convened an emergency joint meeting and decided to protest collectively. They resolved not to give up until the goal of punishing the perpetrators and obtaining compensation is achieved. Shao Lizi arrived in Wuxi from Beijing the night before for sightseeing. This morning, Xue Mingjian accompanied him to visit various factories, and he returned to Beijing in the evening.

[Our Jiangyin Dispatch, 14th] The Chengxin News Reporters Association will send Li Xiufeng and Xi Xiaohua to Wuxi on the 15th to participate in the meeting of reporters from various cities along the Beijing-Shanghai Railway to support the destruction of the Renbao newspaper in Wuxi.

### Impressions of Northern Jiangsu Folk Life (3): Broken Highways and Long Coastlines

— By Our Reporter Zhang Shengzhi

The highway line connecting Tongzhou, Rugao, and Hai'an is the lifeline for the National Army's supplies in northern Jiangsu. The reporter group's activities in northern Jiangsu this time also relied entirely on these highway lines, providing us with many conveniences.

We spent half of our entire interview program sitting in ten-wheeled trucks, almost shaking our bones loose. The plains of northern Jiangsu are mostly loose sandy soil, so when the car travels on the highway, it is as if we have arrived in the desert area of Mongolia. Gusts of wind and sand rolled up from behind the car, engulfing not only the trees and houses beside the road, but also the travelers sitting in the car. Before the car had traveled ten miles, every passenger's face was "completely unrecognizable." Hair and eyebrows were covered with a layer of yellow dust. Seeing each other's strange appearance, we couldn't help but laugh.

A section chief Chen from the headquarters accompanied us to eat dust together. He was still fortunate that the weather was helping, and we could still run around east and west amidst the flying sand and rocks. Otherwise, the highway would be a muddy mess, and the car wouldn't be able to move.

It is said that the authorities, considering that the highway is not suitable for rainy season activities, which affects military affairs to no small extent, plan to tunnel through a small mountain next to Langshan to use as paving material. However, the plan is too large, and manpower and financial resources cannot be managed for a while. The current transition method is to have the people laboriously utilize the broken bricks from the remaining walls of the demolished buildings and pile them on the highway to replace the stone pavement, so as to prevent the entire wheel from sinking into the mud during the rainy season.

Such a road surface not only makes the passengers suffer, but also harms the car. If a car is driven in Shanghai, assuming it has a lifespan of five years, then it can all be sent to its end in just one year on the highway in northern Jiangsu. Also, because the road surface is too uneven, we can often hear some tragic cases of "yellow croakers" being thrown off and falling to their deaths from the tops of cars carrying cotton bales from Dongtai to Nantong.

I once talked to a road repairer, and he felt that this road repair work was inexplicable. He said, "When the New Fourth Army came, they told us to destroy the highway. When the National Army came, they told me to restore it immediately." Finally, he smiled and said, "I destroyed this small section of road with my own hands, but I also restored it with my own hands, and the time interval was only a few hours. The former was a nighttime affair, and the latter was a daytime affair." After he finished speaking, he laughed innocently.

In addition to these broken highways, northern Jiangsu is also naturally endowed with a long coastline. To put it bluntly, the National Army has maintained the highway line, while the Communist Army controls the coastal area. Militarily speaking, the only obstacle to the suppression work in northern Jiangsu is that the National Army has not yet been able to ensure security in the coastal area. In the past, the province had a planned organized water police force, but so far, personnel and funds have become a problem. We have only heard the stairs creak, but no one has come down. At the same time, the coast of northern Jiangsu also has unique characteristics. Because of the accumulation of sand, large sea vessels cannot approach the coastline. It is necessary to build ships separately, which is not enough to talk about prevention and control. Therefore, the provincial government's plan has invisibly become empty talk on paper. The Communist Army, however, has used the terrorist policies of burning and killing, and the opportunistic policy of reforming land, to control coastal fishing boats and dust people, and even used the intricate port and river channels to create a "modern Liangshan Marsh." As a result, the residents living in the coastal area of northern Jiangsu can no longer talk about living and working in peace. In the past, the rural economy of the vast reclamation area has been forced to the brink of bankruptcy.

Here is a small story, from which we can see the activities of the Communist Army in the coastal area and the number of troops. Originally, there is a special product in northern Jiangsu, white shrimp. When the Communist Army occupied the area, because they were all searched and plundered, the market price in the Nantong area would be as high as five or six thousand yuan per catty. But when the Communist Army fled elsewhere, the white shrimp would immediately plummet. So, when we can eat white shrimp for over a thousand yuan a catty, we can definitely appreciate that the Communist Army has once again scurried to another place, or that their troops have been reduced.

Editorial

### Sunshine Appears in the Korean Situation

At the time of the visit of the Korean revolutionary leader, Syngman Rhee, to China, reports related to the development of the Korean situation have been coming from various sources. The Chinese people and the people of the Three Han Kingdoms are as close as brothers, so we pay close attention to the situation in Korea. We feel gratified that from these reports from various places, we can already see an outline of the possible development of the situation, at least it can have a clarifying effect on the situation that has developed in Korea from the time of the Japanese surrender to the present. Some sunshine has appeared in the dense haze. We welcome the appearance of sunshine.

The recent reports on the Korean situation that are available are: (1) When the Korean revolutionary leader, Syngman Rhee, visited Chairman Chiang yesterday, according to news reports, Chairman Chiang immediately expressed his great sympathy for Korea's struggle for independence and said: China and Korea have always been brotherly states, and they should help each other and cooperate. China has decided to make its greatest efforts to assist Korea in establishing a government; (2) In the foreign ministers' conference currently being held in Moscow, US Secretary of State Marshall recently sent a letter to Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, criticizing the Soviet Union's actions in Korea, demanding that the Soviet Union, in accordance with the agreement on Korea made at the Moscow Conference of the Three Great Powers in 1945, promptly reopen the Soviet-American Joint Commission in Korea to support the establishment of an independent Korean government, and requesting that a date be set this summer to review the achievements of the Joint Commission and the policies towards Korea. Marshall also stated at the end of his letter that if the Soviet Union does not agree to these issues, the US government is prepared to take the necessary steps in southern Korea to implement the agreement on the Korean situation reached at the Moscow Conference of the Three Great Powers in 1945; appropriating US$200 million to promote the recovery of South Korea, this appropriation may eventually be increased to US$500 or 600 million.

China and Korea are as close as lips and teeth, and the Chinese people always hope that Korea's independence and unification can be realized as soon as possible; the Chinese government can also give sincere support to Korea's independence and unification in accordance with the public opinion of the people. At the time of the Cairo Conference, the four powers fighting against Japan decided on the basic policy to be adopted towards Korea. Supporting the emergence of an independent and unified Korea and upholding the spirit of the Cairo Declaration can be said to be the Chinese government's basic policy towards Korea. This time, when Syngman Rhee came to China, Chairman Chiang once again reiterated our policy towards Korea; that is, he greatly sympathized with Korea's struggle for independence; China and Korea have always been brotherly states, and they should help each other and cooperate. China has decided to make its greatest efforts to assist Korea in establishing a government. The clarity of the Chinese government's policy towards Korea is evident here. Due to the current various signs, although the man-made obstacles in Korea may not be eliminated for a while, the establishment of a provisional Korean government in the near future may be within the realm of possibility. Even if its power cannot reach the entire Korean territory, the establishment of a provisional government will undoubtedly greatly benefit the development of the Korean situation. We sincerely hope that the establishment of this government will be in the not too distant future.

Precisely because we have such a strong expectation for Korea's independence, we hope that the Korean people can sincerely cooperate to establish their political power, consolidate their political power, and ensure the independence and autonomy of their nation. According to news brought back by those who have recently inspected Korea, the political groups in Korea are like bamboo shoots after rain, numbering over two hundred. On the one hand, this is enough to show the Korean people's political awakening, which is a gratifying phenomenon; on the other hand, it also indicates the decline of the spirit of cooperation, resulting in the emergence of so many political groups. There is strength in unity; therefore, we hope that the people of the Three Han Kingdoms can discard their prejudices and step up cooperation. We feel gratified that when Syngman Rhee met with Chairman Chiang, according to news reports, although Rhee expressed that he and another leader, Kim Gu, cooperated very closely, the Korean people all hoped that they both could serve as leaders; it can be seen that Kim and Rhee have been able to move towards cooperation. We hope that this spirit of cooperation can be further promoted, so that the entire people of the Three Han Kingdoms can be condensed into a solid body and give full play to the mission they will bear in Asian history thereafter.

### Foreign Ministers' Conference Enters Decision-Making Stage; Austrian Peace Treaty Expected to be Drafted; Clark Travels from Vienna to Soviet Capital Again

[Reported by this newspaper] Moscow, 14th Radio: At today's meeting of the four foreign ministers, Marshall decided to confront Molotov. Marshall will demand that the Soviet side agree in principle to sign a permanent four-power agreement guaranteeing that Germany will not be rearmed. Marshall believes that although the details of the four-power agreement can be discussed at any time, the Soviet Union must indicate its agreement or disagreement on this matter at this time.

[United Press, Moscow, 13th] After the initial verbal battle at the four foreign ministers' conference, it has begun to enter a decisive week since last night in order to determine whether important resolutions can be reached on the future of Germany and various issues of the Austrian peace treaty. The foreign ministers have now given up hope of resolving the points of contention in the German peace treaty that are obstructing the progress of the closed-door meeting, but the foreign ministers of the United Kingdom and the United States still hope to negotiate a compromise solution this week so that the Austrian peace treaty can be drafted before the end of the conference. The consensus of the delegations of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France is that if the Soviet Union can make concessions on the Austrian agreement this week, it is expected that the draft can be completed within ten days; if it is not achieved, the deadlock will be broken. The foreign ministers will now expedite this work on Saturday. If no agreement can be reached on a detailed plan for resolving Germany, they will proceed to discuss the US proposal for a four-nation, forty-year agreement to prevent German aggression, as well as the distribution of German coal and the Austrian peace treaty.

Although the United States may submit the four-power agreement for discussion on Monday, it does not expect it to produce any results, as the United Kingdom and France have expressed support for it with reservations, while the Soviet Union has expressed opposition and is unlikely to change its position. Western countries are now pinning their hopes on the Austrian peace treaty so that they will not have nothing significant to show for their departure from Moscow. However, the major obstacle to this matter is the Soviet Union's demand for $100 million worth of German property in the Soviet-occupied zone of Austria. The Soviet Union has not yet agreed to the US proposal to determine its ownership. The intention of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France is to determine that the Soviet Union should not demand the property that the Nazis forcibly occupied in Austria, but so far there is no tendency for either side to make concessions. However, fair observers say that the Soviet Union, like other countries, is eager for peace in Austria, as this would allow the Soviet Union to stop supplying the costs of occupying Austria and withdraw the Soviet troops stationed in Hungary and Romania to maintain the supply lines to Austria.

[United Press, Moscow, 13th] It is heard that General Clark will come to the Soviet capital again from Vienna this week to assist Secretary of State Marshall in conducting conference affairs. Clark returned to Vienna last week because the Austrian peace treaty seemed to be delayed indefinitely. Clark will return to Moscow soon, hoping to discuss the Austrian peace treaty before the end of the conference.

[United Press, Moscow, 13th] An authoritative person said today that the results of the behind-the-scenes negotiations at the Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference have led the three Western countries to reach an agreement on the method of distributing German coal to France, thereby eliminating one of the main obstacles to the Foreign Ministers' Conference. The agreement assumes that the Saar region is economically merged with France, so France obtains most of its coal. The delivery of coal is flexible depending on the amount of production, but it guarantees that France can obtain a certain amount at any time. The United States played a mediating role between the United Kingdom and France, as French Foreign Minister Bidault did not approve of German economic unification unless it was guaranteed that France could obtain sufficient coal. British Foreign Secretary Bevin initially opposed accepting the constraints to supply France, but an agreement was reached after mediation by US Secretary of State Marshall.

### The Two Mr. Marshalls Have Yet to Meet, Causing Various Speculations

[United Press Moscow, 13th] Secretary of State Marshall and Soviet Premier Stalin have yet to meet. Street talk here tonight is increasingly apprehensive. The British and French Foreign Ministers have already entered the Kremlin one after the other, but Mr. Marshall has been staying in Moscow for 35 days without being invited, and to the best of current knowledge, has not sought an audience. Some Soviet people have raised various questions about why Mr. Marshall and Stalin have not yet met, such as: "Is the situation not good?", "Are the two at odds?", "Will Marshall return home directly without being invited or seeking an audience with Stalin?". However, the general opinion is that Mr. Marshall will eventually meet with Stalin before leaving the Soviet Union. Even if there is no invitation, he will seek an audience, and Stalin will be happy to receive him at that time. However, insiders (to borrow a phrase from Soviet writers) say that Stalin has experienced all kinds of things, and his success lies in his ability to wait for an opportunity that is beneficial to him. However, Mr. Marshall is also adept at waiting for opportunities, and Stalin may miss his chance this time. President Truman's aid to Greece and Turkey has cast a shadow over the Foreign Ministers' Conference. For months, no action by foreign politicians has shaken the Soviet Union as much as this, which may be the underlying reason why Stalin did not issue an invitation to Marshall. Another group believes that the Kremlin is watching how American public opinion reacts to the "Truman Doctrine." In fact, American criticisms of the Truman Doctrine are being published or broadcasted by newspapers and radio stations here. Today, the newspapers also published Wallace's speech in the UK. Whether Wallace will come to the Soviet Union during this trip has also become a common question among Soviet people.

### The United States' Firm Attitude Should Make the Soviet Union Fearful

Tydings on American Diplomatic Actions

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 13th] Democratic Senator Tydings recently broadcast a theory stating that the recent diplomatic actions taken by the United States can be summarized as follows: (1) A policy of taking active actions against the Soviet Union; (2) Opposition to the expansion of Soviet power; (3) Opposition to communism in Greece and Turkey; (4) President Truman's plan to aid Greece and Turkey has slightly softened the Soviet attitude. The firmness of the American attitude will surely make the Soviet Union fearful. It is noteworthy that Soviet representatives have made concessions in both the Moscow Four Foreign Ministers Conference and the United Nations Security Council last week.

### The Soviet Union Plans to Conclude a Treaty of Alliance with Romania

[Agence France-Presse, London, 13th] According to information received by the British government, before withdrawing its troops from Romania, the Soviet Union will propose concluding a treaty of alliance with Romania. It is reported that the Romanian trade delegation discussed this issue with the Soviet side during its visit to Moscow last month.

### The Soviet Union and India Decide to Exchange Ambassadors

[TASS Moscow, 13th] As a result of the exchange of notes between the Indian Ambassador to China, Menon, and the Soviet Ambassador to China, Petrov, in early April, it has been agreed that the Soviet government and the Indian government have decided to exchange diplomatic envoys and establish embassies.

### The United Nations Special Session Will Be Held on the 28th of this Month to Seek a Solution to the Palestine Problem

[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 13th] United Nations Secretary-General Lie announced today that 29 United Nations member states have agreed to participate in the United Nations General Assembly special session to discuss the Palestine issue. Therefore, I have sent invitations to all member states and decided to hold this special session on the 28th of this month. No one can predict how long the United Nations General Assembly special session will last. The United Kingdom hopes to limit the plan to the agenda of the United Nations General Assembly in September this year, but delegations from some countries may hope to thoroughly discuss this issue. It is expected that the composition of the special committee and its powers will be one of the most difficult issues to resolve. The United Kingdom hopes to participate in this committee itself, but the Arab and Jewish parties should be excluded. Arab countries have not expressed any opinions on this matter, not even on the principle of convening a special session of the United Nations General Assembly, but the Jewish side will probably send representatives to the United Nations General Assembly to present their views.

### The American People Approve the International Trade Charter

[Reuters Washington, 13th] The State Department announced that the government recently informally sought opinions from people in six major cities on the draft charter of the International Trade Organization, and the ratio of those who approved to those who opposed was thirteen to one. Those who were consulted felt great interest in specific measures to safeguard international economic cooperation.

### Pepper Declines to Become Leader of US Third Party, Advocates Maintaining Two Major Parties

[United Press International Washington, 13th] Democratic Senator Pepper cabled from Miami today, declining former Vice President Wallace's invitation to become the leader of a third party. Pepper also guaranteed that as long as the Democratic Party maintains a liberal style, he will always be a Democrat. Wallace is currently giving a speech in London, calling President Truman's new foreign policy "brutal imperialism." Pepper's telegram stated: "I have resolutely stated to all liberals that any attempt to organize a third party would be a big mistake. If the Democratic Party is unwilling to carry out its mission of serving the people, there is no need for Wallace and Pepper to launch a third party movement, and the people themselves will launch this movement. I oppose the existence of three major parties in the United States and support only two major parties. I will continue to fight in the Democratic Party and spare no effort to make the Democratic Party a truly free party of the United States." At the same time, Truman flew back to Washington from Kansas City after returning to his hometown to visit relatives. He refused to comment on Wallace's speeches abroad and the domestic telephone labor strike before his trip. Some Democratic senators today advocated asking Truman to expel Wallace from the party and issued a statement denying Wallace's foreign policy declaration. Now some key members of both parties are demanding that the President respond to Wallace and issue a statement to the world that Wallace's words cannot represent the U.S. government. According to the opinions of some first-class political observers, Truman will not allow Wallace's unbridled remarks, and it is expected that the White House will issue a statement soon.

### Wallace Advocates a New Deal, Saying Only "One World" Can Avoid Destruction

[United Press International London, 13th] Former U.S. Vice President Wallace gave a broadcast speech on the British Broadcasting Corporation today, the second anniversary of the death of former President Roosevelt, saying that the United Kingdom now has more "New Dealers" than the United States, and said that "the vast power and wealth of the United States are not used to raise the living standards of some countries that are sufficient to become foreign markets for the United States, but are used for strategic and military aspects. If we do not supply these countries with guns and cannons, but help them with machine tools, we can prevent the economic depression in the United States, and our international trade can make rapid progress, and its economic prosperity is enough to prevent communism from gaining a foothold in the West." He said: The Soviet Union is indeed an expansionist, just like the United Kingdom in the past and the United States in the Pacific and other places today. But I mean that some countries that possess atomic bombs and have not suffered from the ravages of war like the Soviet Union should take on the mission of trying a New Deal to safeguard peace. This New Deal, if implemented in the modern world, can create world prosperity and no longer engage in outdated international bullying of weak countries. I oppose Americans who attempt to rule the world and exploit the world under the pretext of eliminating the red threat, but support other Americans who deeply believe that the task of the United States is to contribute new technologies, increase world production, consumption, trade, and the enjoyment of people around the world. The security of the United Kingdom does not depend on connecting Eastern and Western countries. The United Kingdom can only prosper under "One World". All politicians only talk about "One World", and all scientists and far-sighted people believe that only "One World" can avoid the destruction of the world. The United Kingdom must understand that the world needs to adopt a New Deal, because the United Kingdom's "Old Deal" has been declared a failure.

British Newspapers Offer No Comment

[United Press London, 14th] Wallace's broadcast speech advocated implementing a "New Deal" in the world. Today, all British newspapers published it under large headlines, but rarely offered any comments. The Conservative Daily Mail said that Mr. Wallace is a loyal and well-intentioned person. Although he sees a bright prospect, the path he wants to take is very vague. We believe that Mr. Wallace's goal is inevitably wrong, and his lessons should be published in Washington or Moscow.

### Latest News

[Our newspaper] Moscow, 14th broadcast: Negotiations to extend the Anglo-Soviet agreement have broken down. It is said that the re-signing of the Anglo-Soviet agreement is hopeless during the Moscow conference.

### "Intelligence-Boosting" New Drug

[Central News Agency Nanjing, 14th] China Natural Science Society News: The United States has recently invented a new organic compound belonging to the amino acid group, called glutamic acid (transliteration). It is derived from the decomposition of proteins. If it is placed in food and fed to mentally retarded children, it can improve them in a short period of time, without exception. At the very least, it can also improve their intelligence. In the future world, there will be no more fools and idiots.

Jinnah is prepared to accept the decision of the International Boundary Commission to demarcate the partition area of India and Pakistan.

[United Press International Argentina, 14th] The newly appointed Argentine Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Dr. Cantoni, is determined that when he arrives in the Soviet Union to take office, he will not only represent the Argentine government, but his main task is to "introduce the feelings of the Argentine people towards the Soviet people." Cantoni told reporters before his departure that he hoped to promote the relationship between the Soviet Union and Argentina to become more realistic and prosperous. The Soviet Union is one of the countries most closely related to Argentina's five-year plan, because the completion of President Perón's five-year plan depends on the technology of the United States and the Soviet Union and the labor of Italy. Cantoni expressed his views on the commercial relations between the Soviet Union and Argentina, saying: "Since we established relations with each other, the Soviet Union has allowed all our material requirements. The Soviet Union also sent first-class technical personnel representatives to our country, and when we urgently needed newsprint, it shipped a large amount of newsprint." Cantoni did not believe that the status of the Communist Party in Argentina would affect the relations between the Soviet Union and Argentina, and expressed great doubts about the rumors that Argentina would ban the Communist Party. Since the Soviet Union and Argentina severed relations in 1917, it has been 30 years. When President Perón took office on June 4 last year, a Soviet trade delegation arrived in Argentina, and the Soviet Union and Argentina re-established diplomatic relations on June 6 of the same year. Ambassador Cantoni is the first Argentine representative to enter the Soviet Union in 30 years. The entourage this time includes technical personnel and experts in various fields. Each department of the Argentine government has sent a representative to accompany him, totaling about 50 people.

### Verdict in the Case of Foreign Businessmen Disrupting Financial Markets: Malsbary Sentenced to One Year in Prison, 40,000 Hong Kong Dollars in U.S. Dollars Confiscated, and 20,000 Confiscated and Turned Over to the Public; Foreign Exchange and Gold Parts Exempt from Discussion

[Our newspaper] The case of foreign businessman Ebbas & Co. illegally buying and selling foreign currencies and disrupting financial markets, the defendant Malsbary, was concluded after a trial by the District Court and sentenced at 2:00 p.m. yesterday. Judge Meng Tingke asked the defendant Malsbary his age and origin, then stood up and read the main text of the judgment: "Malsbary is sentenced to one year of imprisonment for continuously receiving and paying for foreign currency coupons in order to disrupt financial markets. 40,000 Fuh banknotes and 20,000 Hong Kong dollars are confiscated and turned over to the public." He then explained the reasons for the judgment, stating that the defendant's managed Ebbas & Co., after the National Government announced the Economic Emergency Measures Plan, from February 18 to March 3, received 40,000 Fuh banknotes and 20,000 Hong Kong dollars, and also successively sold 200,186.38 U.S. dollars and sold 57,860 U.S. dollars. The Economic Emergency Measures Plan is a rapid measure taken by the government in the event of a major change in the national economy, so it naturally takes effect before being ratified by the legislative body in order to deter and ensure security. Furthermore, because the defendant himself has admitted that the company accepts deposits, it should be regarded as a bank according to law. Since the defendant is the manager of the company, he should bear criminal responsibility and is sentenced to one year of imprisonment. Except for the U.S. dollars that have already been paid out, which cannot be confiscated, the telegraphic transfers (TT) and mail transfers (DD) bought and sold by the company are different from foreign currency coupons as stipulated in Article 7 of the Measures for Prohibiting the Circulation of Foreign Currency Coupons. Although the Central Bank has not issued a business license, it is also a violation of Article 24 of the revised Provisional Measures for the Central Bank's Management of Foreign Exchange. However, since there is no special express provision for punishing the manager in this article, it is difficult to immediately order the defendant to bear criminal responsibility. Regarding whether the 38 taels of gold seized should be punished, it should be determined based on whether the company managed by the defendant bought, sold, received, or paid for it after the Economic Emergency Measures Plan was announced. Now, after reviewing its accounts, there was no buying, selling, receiving, or paying behavior after February 17, and holding gold does not constitute a crime. Regarding this part, it should be exempt from discussion. It was also announced that if he does not accept the judgment, he can appeal within ten days after receiving the judgment. The defendant's defense attorney, Chen Tingrui, stood up and requested permission to post bail during the appeal period and stated that regardless of whether the defendant himself appeals or not, the defense attorney will independently appeal in accordance with the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Law. The court will rule on the application for bail in writing, and Malsbary will remain in custody.

### Reynolds' Bomber, a Round-the-World Flight Special Plane, Passed Through Shanghai This Morning, Stopping for One Hour and Twenty Minutes to Refuel, and Continued Flying to Tokyo to Cross the Sea Back to the United States

[Our newspaper] American pen magnate Reynolds' "Reynolds' Bomber" special plane for a round-the-world flight took off from New York at 6:11 a.m. Shanghai time on the 13th. After passing through Newfoundland, Paris, Cairo, and Calcutta, it arrived safely at Jiangwan Airport in this city at 2:00 p.m. today (summer time). It stayed in Shanghai for one hour and twenty minutes and continued to take off for Tokyo at 3:20 p.m. It will take the route of Anchorage, Alaska, pass through Seattle on the west coast of the United States, and go straight back to New York.

The U.S. military airport in Jiangwan had made various preparations for the landing of Reynolds' special plane the night before. The plane was originally rumored to arrive in Shanghai yesterday morning, but later news came that it would arrive at 4:00 p.m. However, at that time, there was news that it would be delayed until 9:00 p.m. Finally, in the evening, it was confirmed that the plane had left Calcutta at 6:03 p.m., and it was estimated that it would arrive at midnight.

At 2:00 a.m. this morning, the plane landed at Jiangwan Airport. The plane is a twin-engine A-26 giant plane. The fuselage is silver, and the nose and tail are painted blue, which is quite beautiful. After landing, refueling began immediately. Reynolds himself also served as the navigator in the plane.

Reynolds originally planned to complete the round-the-world flight in 55 hours, but in Paris and Cairo, there were slight delays due to refueling and mechanical failures, so it has actually exceeded the scheduled time. However, Reynolds firmly believes that he can still create a new record for round-the-world flights. According to the existing record of 91 hours and 12 minutes, it is held by Huth.

### Dai Rulin Suspected of Murder, the District Prosecutor's Office Filed a Public Prosecution, and the Families of the Deceased Officers and Soldiers Petitioned Many Places

[Our newspaper] The case of Dai Rulin, captain of the Hai Min steamship, the defendant in the Fu Bo warship tragedy, has been investigated and concluded by Prosecutor Cao Hong of the District Prosecutor's Office. It is believed that when the Fu Bo warship was hit and sunk, the Hai Min steamship ignored it and did not rescue the officers and soldiers who fell into the water, attempting to escape, causing more than 100 officers and soldiers of the entire warship to die. This constitutes the crime of murder under the Criminal Law. Since Dai Rulin is the captain of the Hai Min steamship, he should bear all criminal responsibility. The crimes under Article 55, Article 271, Paragraph 1, Article 15 of the Criminal Law and Article 128 of the Maritime Law are combined, and a public prosecution is filed in accordance with Article 230, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law.

In addition, 46 family members of the deceased officers and soldiers of the Fu Bo warship organized a petition group and went to the District Prosecutor's Office to petition at 10:00 a.m. yesterday. Prosecutor Cao Hong, who was in charge of the case, received them, comforted them, and stated that the court would handle the case fairly. The petition group then went to President Chiang's residence, the Supervisory Commissioner's Office, the Navy Headquarters, and the Bar Association to petition. Finally, they went to the District Court, where President Zha received them and stated that the court would not be affected by anything and would judge fairly.

### Suspected Arson in Zhabei and Pudong, Two Cases

[Our newspaper] A strange fire occurred at the Boai Barber Shop at No. 36 Datong Road at 3:00 a.m. on the 13th. Fortunately, the shop assistants were awakened by the thick smoke in their dreams. After inspection, they found that the smoke was coming from a cattail bag next to the escalator and extinguished it immediately, preventing a major disaster. After opening the cattail bag, they saw that the contents were cotton soaked in oil, which was obviously arson. Therefore, the shop owner, Xu Huaiyan, questioned everyone in the shop one by one. When he questioned the apprentice Ding Jiuxing (19 years old, from Yangzhou), because his words were hesitant and he saw that Ding's coat was still not taken off, his suspicion was great, so he sent him to the Zhabei Police Sub-bureau. After interrogation, Ding confessed: This sentence was a gift from a sugarcane peddler he asked one day, and now he attaches great importance to it and is continuing the investigation.

Also, at around 12:00 p.m. yesterday, several residents, including Yan Guoliang, in the vicinity of Fukang Branch Road, Nantao Dirt Pond, Yangjia Ferry, Pudong, saw a child holding a box of matches, a glass medicine bottle, and a small bundle of rice straw, which he was lighting, so they stepped forward to twist him and sent him to the police station. According to his confession, his name is Zhang Lixun, ten years old (but according to the reporter's observation, he is at least fifteen years old), from Anhui, living at No. 3 Sanpailou, Nanshi. He came to Pudong to pick up garbage with his sister and brother-in-law and other four people, and was not an arsonist. However, when asked why he was holding rice straw and matches, his words were hesitant and he could not answer everything, only kneeling on the ground and begging for mercy. The Yangjing Sub-bureau and the 8th Inspection Brigade of the Garrison Headquarters attach great importance to this case.

[Our newspaper] The Shanghai Vocational Youth Association, in order to arouse citizens' attention to strictly prevent arson by bandits, launched a three-day parade, which was held in the evening. Last night was the second day, and the parade went to the Eastern District. Before the event, the association received a strange phone call threatening Mao Yueshan, who participated in the parade, claiming that if he participated in the evening parade again, he would be rewarded with a hand grenade. However, the association was not frightened by it, and Mr. Mao also participated in the parade as usual, with strict precautions all the way, and no accidents occurred. The association also scheduled to continue the parade to Nanshi tonight.

### Case of Jiaotong University Student Crushed to Death: Mayor Urges Reconciliation; Both Parties Negotiate This Morning; Texaco Consultant Surrounded Yesterday

[Central News Agency] In the case of Jia Zigan, a Jiaotong University student, who was fatally injured by a Texaco Oil Company vehicle on Qimei Road on the 4th of this month, the driver involved has been transferred by the Xinshijie Police Station to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation. Yesterday at 10:00 AM, Wu Shi, the American legal advisor to Texaco, and Zhou Konghuai, the Chinese legal advisor, went to Jiaotong University to discuss the aftermath of the case. They were surrounded and held hostage by dozens of students from the university, who demanded that Li Fuwei, the chairman of Texaco, come to the university in exchange for Wu Shi and Zhou Konghuai. The matter came to the attention of the American Consulate General in Shanghai, and Deputy Consuls Coffin and Lawson went to the Xujiahui branch of the police station at 3:00 PM to seek assistance. The police station dispatched personnel to Jiaotong University to negotiate with Wang Wenchao, the director of student affairs. Wang insisted that Wu Shi and others could only be released after Texaco Chairman Li Fuwei came to the university, stating that the crowd's emotions were high and could not be suppressed. The vehicle they rode to the school, number 50092, had its tires slashed by students from the school and could not be driven. It is understood that Jiaotong University is demanding 635 million yuan in compensation from Texaco for the deceased's bereavement, before the matter can be settled. However, Texaco believes that the case is being investigated by the District Prosecutor's Office and cannot be negotiated privately until a lawsuit is filed and a ruling is made by the District Court. Therefore, both parties remain deadlocked. Yang Anzhong, the director of the Xujiahui branch, reported the situation to Mayor Wu, Deputy Director Yu, and Commander Xuan, who all instructed that the matter be handled cautiously in accordance with the law. Mayor Wu personally went to Jiaotong University at around 7:00 PM to handle the matter, urging Jiaotong University representatives that the matter should be resolved through negotiation. It was agreed that negotiations would be held at the Mayor's Office at 10:00 AM this morning. Jiaotong University will be represented by students Wu Guoding and Liang Gui, while Texaco will be personally represented by Chairman Li Fuwei. At 8:20, Wu Shi and Zhou Konghuai and their vehicle were released by Jiaotong University.

### Food Supply Future Unworrying; Rice Prices in Production Areas Continue to Soar; Chairman Promises Thorough Investigation to Suppress Prices; Authorities Determined to Crack Down on Merchants Disregarding Laws

[Reported by this newspaper] Yesterday, commodity prices in the city showed no signs of decline, and the price of gold and paper money continued to surge sharply, causing anxiety among middle and lower-class citizens. Mayor Wu specially met with reporters yesterday afternoon and made a statement. He believes that suppressing commodity prices remains optimistic. The authorities originally planned to immediately release a large amount of rice, but temporarily suspended sales due to the influx of goods and passengers yesterday. The Mayor pointed out that the rise in rice prices is due to higher prices in production areas. For example, the cost of transporting rice from Changshu to Shanghai is 160,000 yuan, and the price of Wuxi rice delivered to Shanghai is also 141,000 yuan. The Mayor reported this situation to Chairman Chiang yesterday morning, and the Chairman immediately promised to send personnel to the production areas for a thorough investigation, in order to lower rice prices on the spot. Although yarn prices have fluctuated in recent days, when the authorities sent personnel to investigate yesterday, most yarn merchants, fearing interference, immediately suspended business operations. However, the market closure cannot be maintained for long.

The Mayor also stated that the economic emergency measures have had a great effect, but some unscrupulous merchants have become complacent over time, disregarding the law and plotting to stir up trouble and seize opportunities for profit, which is extremely hateful. The authorities are determined to take effective measures to crack down on them and suppress commodity prices. The organization for suppressing commodity prices has been established and will begin investigative actions today. Any illegal acts such as raising commodity prices and privately dealing in gold and paper money will be severely punished in accordance with the economic emergency measures once discovered. When the reporter asked about the Mayor's thoughts on the sentencing of the "foreign tiger" yesterday, he said, "My legal views have no concept of Western or Chinese ethnicity. Anyone who commits a crime should be punished according to the law." The Mayor also hopes that those in the city who engage in black market gold and paper money will take the "foreign tiger" as a warning.

### Industrial Association Transports Taiwanese Coal: Sends Personnel to Beijing to Request Approval

[Reported by this newspaper] The Shanghai branch of the National Industrial Association stated that the Fuel Management Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs only allows 20% of the monthly coal allocation for industrial use in Shanghai, which is far from the actual needs. The black market coal prices are high, and most factories cannot afford it, resulting in more and more factories suspending work. In order to help members solve the coal problem, the association has negotiated with a coal mine company in Taiwan, which has agreed to supply coal. The association has specially dispatched Consul-General Chu He and Qing to Beijing to request the Ministry of Economic Affairs to approve the association to purchase and transport coal directly from Taiwan in accordance with the current actual needs of the factories, so that factories that have stopped work due to the coal shortage can resume work as soon as possible.

### China Merchants Bureau's Shipping Schedule Adjusted Starting Today

The ship will load cargo in Yingkou and sail directly to Shantou. After that, it will run regularly between Shanghai, Shantou, and Guangzhou with Peide. Deng Keng and Yan Guan were originally scheduled to sail the North and South Shipping Line, but the schedule loss was too great, so it was decided to stop. The Shanghai-Yingkou line has little cargo, so it will sail from Shanghai to Qingdao and Tianjin. After arriving in Yingkou, it will sail directly back to Shanghai. The Yuanpei and Qiujin are expected to be repaired and opened around the 20th of this month.

Transshipment Matters

If any branch has transit goods that must be directly discharged, they should notify the head office at any time so that it can be transferred from the vessels that are not on a scheduled route. If loading on a scheduled ship, the Shanghai transit point must be the first principle.

### Reader Consultation - Legal Queries

(1) Refusal to Vacate

Wang Chongxian asks:

(1) Three or four years ago, I rented all the remaining rooms in my house to tenants A and B. Currently, my family has increased in size and the space is insufficient, so I requested A and B to "return the house." Unexpectedly, A and B refused to move out, citing "difficulty in finding a house at present and the need to pay a large tip" as reasons. The "Housing Lease Management Committee" in this city specializes in mediating housing disputes. I don't know what procedures to follow to make a request?

[Lawyer Zhu Yakui replies:] Collecting "tips" is illegal. Using "the need to pay a 'tip' to rent a house elsewhere" as a reason to refuse to move out is not valid. However, the housing shortage in Shanghai is severe and has not been resolved. Therefore, a reasonable date should be determined for vacating the house. Furthermore, the Housing Lease Management Committee was abolished by a resolution of the Municipal Council last year.

(2) Malicious Extortion

Li Zhigan asks: I own a single-room house in a lane, which I rented out five years ago. Now, because the tenant has obtained a Western-style house in the Pudong district and moved there in February of this year, my house has been vacant since then. In fact, the tenant clearly has no need to continue the lease. Moreover, according to the lease, both parties can notify the other party three months in advance to terminate the lease, and it is stipulated that subletting is not allowed. I immediately sent a letter stating that I would take back the house, but the tenant replied, demanding a transfer fee of several taels of gold, claiming that this was due to social custom. I would rather pay rent and leave the house vacant. Therefore, I earnestly request your guidance so that I may follow it.

[Lawyer Zhu Yakui replies:] According to your letter, if the facts are as stated, and the tenant still refuses to move out after formal notification as stipulated in the lease, you can present evidence and sue the tenant in court.

After the match, the Qunli Small Football Team challenged Qingbai and continued to play an exhibition game. In the first half, Qunli opened the scoring and won 1-0. In the second half, Bai tried his best to counterattack and finally won 4-2. The game raised 2,124,650 yuan, which was donated to the Youth Center for the purchase of equipment.

### National Bank and Citibank Reach Agreement on Cotton Funding: Textile Mills Can Apply to Open Letters of Credit
[Our Newspaper Report] It is reported that in order to actively promote cotton imports, the Central Bank has reached an agreement with Citibank to have Citibank pay the price of 230,000 bales, approximately USD 40 million. All textile mills may apply to Citibank for opening letters of credit (Authority to Purchase) based on the import licenses issued by the Provisional Import Control Commission, so that the bank in New York can accept the cotton draft, allowing foreign exporters to immediately recover their payments. Local textile mills can also follow the procedures announced on March 19 to settle foreign exchange. It is heard that textile mills can consult the designated banks or Citibank in Shanghai for all detailed procedures.

**Imported Goods Not Requiring Foreign Exchange Settlement Still Handled as Usual**
[Our Newspaper Report] The Executive Committee of the Provisional Import Control Commission previously discussed a proposal to allow the import of goods not requiring foreign exchange settlement beyond quota limits under certain conditions. It was decided to organize a foreign exchange source subcommittee meeting to review the foreign exchange sources of each case and grant import licenses if deemed qualified. However, various sectors have many doubts about this matter. This newspaper's reporter interviewed the person in charge of the committee to clarify the truth. It was revealed that this case was sent to Nanjing, and after Director General Zhang Gongquan and Deputy Director General Li Fusun consulted the National Economic Commission, they believed that if this method of using foreign exchange was implemented, unscrupulous merchants would inevitably seize the opportunity to incite legitimate importers, causing them to suffer losses and undermining the government's intention to regulate imports. Therefore, this method will not be implemented, and all imported goods, whether or not they require foreign exchange settlement, will still be handled as usual.

[Additional Report] Related sources stated: After the Executive Committee of the Provisional Import Control Commission passed two principles on the review of foreign exchange sources for imports not requiring foreign exchange at the meeting on the 10th, the outside world, not understanding the truth, even attempted to collude in hoarding US dollars, hoping to replace foreign exchange, causing fluctuations in the exchange rate of US dollars, which is not appropriate. This ultimately led to the rejection of the newly established accommodating measures.

The market price of white coal remains firm, with little fluctuation. Recent arrivals of Pingxiang coke are still plentiful, but due to sluggish sales, prices are extremely chaotic. Wholesale prices are 700,000 to 750,000 yuan per ton, while retail prices require 900,000 to 950,000 yuan.

**New Buying Momentum Strong, Many Chinese Stocks Hit Limit Up**
Chinese stocks saw new buying interest yesterday, with deliberate attempts to advance, resulting in many new highs and limit-up prices. Although some long positions in the industry were liquidated, most of them returned after selling, leading to frequent reversals after highs.

The market opened high in the morning. After the opening, Jingfu rose to the limit up due to opening prices being much lower than off-exchange prices under mass buying. Xinya also reached the limit up. Numbers 117, 218, 36, 224, 18, and 223 all advanced. Di Yong rose to 3,580 yuan.

As a result, compared to last Saturday, Meiya and Jingfu reached the limit up, Xinhua was uniquely flat, Yongsha and Qinxing each rose by slightly more than half a percent, and Huafeng, Xinguang, Zhongfa, and Xinhe each rose by one percent or slightly more.

**Unable to Balance Income and Expenditure: Silver Shops Petition the City Government**
[Our Newspaper Report] Representatives of the Shanghai silver shop industry, Yao Guilianfang, Yao Qing, and others, totaling five people, submitted petitions to Mayor Wu and Director Wu of the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau at around 11:00 AM yesterday, stating that the income and expenditure of various silver shops have been difficult to balance in the two weeks since they reopened. They requested that the petition be forwarded to the Ministry of Finance, asking for no rigid regulations on the prices of income and expenditure for the industry. At the same time, they requested that the industry be allowed to purchase bullion bars in order to maintain business operations. It is heard that the authorities have agreed to forward the petition.

Starting yesterday, various silver shops have temporarily suspended the income and expenditure business of gold jewelry in stores. However, they are still accepting old gold jewelry from customers in exchange for new gold jewelry. In addition, there are only a few transactions in silverware.

According to Yao Lianfang, when speaking to a reporter, the price of gold jewelry sold in stores, including legal profits and operating expenses, is set at 570,000 yuan per liang (ounce). In addition, rough jewelry costs an additional 20,000 to 30,000 yuan per liang for processing, and fine jewelry is priced separately, all as stipulated by the authorities. In the two weeks since the industry reopened, for Qiu Tianbao, which is managed by him, the net amount of expenditure has been nearly 500 liang, while the total amount of income is only 140 to 150 liang. In general, the income of the same industry is roughly two-tenths of the expenditure. The industry is unable to maintain such an imbalance of supply and demand. Therefore, they are forced to request that the authorities set a different method.

**Reasons for Soaring Yarn and Cloth Prices: Thin Inventory and Control by Hot Money**
[Our Newspaper Report] Regarding the repeated soaring of yarn and cloth prices in recent days, industry insiders analyzed the reasons for the price surge. They said: Aside from the reasons for inflation, the main reasons for the repeated soaring of yarn and cloth prices in recent years are as follows:

(1) The inventory of yarn and cloth in Shanghai is not abundant. When the market fluctuates, this small amount of yarn and cloth immediately rises in a straight line once purchased by a large amount of hot money. They said that before the war, the inventory of cotton yarn in Shanghai often maintained around 200,000 bales, and cloth was in the range of 6-7 million pi. Currently, the amount of cotton yarn available for turnover in Shanghai is no more than 120,000 bales, and cloth is no more than 4-500,000 pi. Therefore, yarn and cloth are almost entirely controlled by a large amount of hot money.

(2) The current consumption of military cloth in the country is five times the pre-war figure. (3) Cotton spindles in China are concentrated in coastal areas. The operating time of spindles in coastal areas is now an average of ten hours per day, compared to twelve hours before the war, which is a decrease of 20%. Therefore, even if all spindles in the area are fully operational, the total output is only 80% of the pre-war figure.

They also said that compared to the soaring rates of various major daily necessities, the soaring of yarn and cloth is still moderate. The sale and adjustment of yarn by China Textile Construction Corporation has helped stabilize yarn and cloth prices. However, when the listed price of Textile Construction is too far from the market price, the subsidy of Textile Construction is not discussed, but the market price cannot be suppressed as a result, and direct consumers do not benefit, only allowing intermediaries to make huge profits. Therefore, in this extraordinary period, it is better to adopt a unified distribution, purchase, and sales policy from raw materials to finished products. They believe that this comprehensive plan can integrate the fragmented parts and achieve a reasonable solution to the current situation of separation between yarn and cloth production and sales.

**National Banking Association to Inaugurate Today in Beijing**
The National Banking Association will hold its inaugural meeting at the Beijing Lizhi Society at 9:00 AM on the 15th. Shanghai representatives Li Fusun and Zhao Dihua, among others, took a car to Beijing the day before yesterday. It is heard that the association will discuss the government's issuance of USD treasury bonds at the meeting, and plans to unite national banks to actively promote the fundraising work, hoping that the USD 400 million bonds will be fully raised as soon as possible.

**New Tea Transactions Stable**
Yesterday, the foreign trade tea market still saw only sporadic small transactions due to buyers taking a wait-and-see approach. In terms of prices, old sellers continued to express their concerns, and new sellers participated in selling off their inventory, so the market continued to be weak. As for domestic sales, tea imports and exports remained balanced, and the market was supported without falling. However, the process of the new Longjing tea produced in Wenhang this year is going downstream, with a sense of obvious decline and hidden stability. The reason for this is that the tea sold by major tea houses in the city a few days ago is all called Mingqian New Longjing, which are the newly sprouted buds of tea trees before the Qingming Festival in the lunar calendar, which are made into objects and shipped to Shanghai for market. Therefore, its quality is exceptionally tender, but because the output is limited, the market is regarded as a treasure by the goods side and stands firmly at the peak. Recently, it has reached the edge of the Grain Rain Festival in the lunar calendar, so the goods shipped to Shanghai are almost all Yuqian New Longjing, and its body has gradually aged, and the price has been reduced among peers.

**Nanchang Yarn Prices See Lively Activity**
[Our Newspaper Report from Nanchang on the 14th] Imported goods in the Nanchang market last week fluctuated with the rising price of the Shanghai market. In particular, the yarn and cloth market was even more lively, with yarn prices rising by about 600,000 yuan in half a month. Today's prices are Shuangma 5.35 million yuan, Lushan 5.1 million yuan, and Shenhu 5.1 million yuan. Ehua also rose by 5-60,000 yuan. Due to poor sales, the export of local products has declined, but grain prices have broken through 10 million in the Gan South and Jiujiang rice markets due to the approaching famine month.

**Cotton Cloth Lacks Spirit**
Quotes for cotton cloth were firm with a hint of weakness, but transactions were still smooth. It is heard that recent sales in the North and Xi'an are still strong, with purchases mainly consisting of raw cloth. The market opened very lively yesterday morning, but speculators are cautious amidst government suppression of prices, and many long positions are sold off, leading to a stable and weak market. Longtou fine cloth secretly quoted over 200,000 yuan, rising to 206,000 yuan, and finally 202,000 yuan, with some transactions. Prices for other Shilin colored cloths were adjusted across the board.

**Allocation of UNRRA Cotton: Subsidy Method to Be Determined**
[Our Newspaper Report] Since the Ministry of Economic Affairs and UNRRA headquarters jointly decided to reduce the price of UNRRA-supplied cotton to 710,000 yuan per dan (50 kg), it was decided that the Textile Control Commission would further subsidize each dan by 60,000 yuan, allocating it to various textile mills for use at a price of 650,000 yuan per dan. However, if the factories calculate the production cost of cotton yarn based on the price of 650,000 yuan per dan of cotton, it will still exceed the current negotiated price for free trading of cotton yarn. As a result of production, it will still lead to losses. In addition, the Textile Control Commission has yet to decide on how to subsidize each factory's UNRRA cotton allocation. Therefore, Director Liu of the Business Department of the Textile Control Commission and Vice Minister Pan of the Ministry of Economic Affairs jointly went to Beijing to discuss a proper solution.

**Tung Oil and Bristle Prices Weak**
[Our Newspaper Report] The foreign prices of tung oil and bristles are becoming increasingly weak. Although prices at the origin are rising slowly, the local market remains unchanged. Tung oil shipments continue to arrive, and Chongqing bristles and Hankou bristles are also being shipped to Shanghai one after another, but without strong foreign sales, there is no good prospect in the near future. Yesterday, the market price for full-grade major market was still 380,000 yuan, with no significant increase. Shanghai bristles were 2.7 million yuan, and Chongqing bristles were 3.6 million yuan. Hankou bristles were more popular due to the scarcity of New York Wharf transfers. The Shanghai market price is still stagnant at 4.6 million yuan.

**Guangzhou Import Control Office Supplements Four Measures**
[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 4th] In order to strictly manage the issuance of import permits by the Kowloon Office, the Guangzhou Office of the Import Control Commission has supplemented four measures. It stipulates that the Kowloon Office can only issue provisional import permits for nine places: Fuzhou, Xiamen, Shantou, Haikou, Zhanjiang, and Kowloon. It also stipulates that, from now on, import permits requested by Hong Kong merchants who have entrusted purchases to registered importers are valid. More than 900 Guangzhou importers have been approved for registration.

**Trials of Japanese War Criminals (Part 1)**

On September 2, 1945, Japan's Instrument of Surrender to the United Nations stipulated that the Emperor and the Japanese government should immediately take appropriate measures to place the Emperor's authority under the control of the Supreme Commander of the United Nations. The Moscow Conference of the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union on December 6 also made this decision, which was agreed to by the Chinese government, entrusting the authority to handle the Emperor to General MacArthur, the Supreme Commander. The handling of Japanese war criminals is based on this decision. The Instrument of Surrender contains the following three provisions:

(1) An International Military Tribunal for the Far East will be organized to try Japanese war criminals, individually or as members of organizations, or in both capacities, for any violations of the laws of peace or crimes included in such violations.

(2) The organization, jurisdiction, and powers of this Tribunal are specified in the Charter of the International Military Tribunal for the Far East.

(3) Any existing or future international, domestic, or occupation courts, commissions, or tribunals established in Japan or in the wartime territories of the United Nations to try war criminals are individually subject to jurisdiction and are not bound by any provision of this Charter.

The Charter of the International Military Tribunal for the Far East is divided into five parts. (1) The first chapter describes the organizational methods of the Tribunal. The Tribunal is located in Tokyo. Judges are appointed by General MacArthur, initially between five and nine in number, later increased to eleven (new members were from India and the Philippines). A President is selected from the judges and appointed by the Supreme Commander of the United Nations. In addition, there is a Secretary-General and several Deputy Secretaries, clerks, and recorders.

A quorum of more than half of the total number of judges is required for the meeting to be established. The severity or absence of a sentence is determined by a majority vote of the judges present. If the votes are equally divided, the President casts the deciding vote. (2) The second chapter describes the general provisions regarding jurisdiction: war criminals, whether individuals or organizations, fall within the jurisdiction of this Tribunal.

Major Japanese war criminals are tried by this Tribunal and punished for their crimes if they are found guilty of (1) violating the laws of peace, (2) violating the laws or customs of war, or (3) committing crimes against humanity. These three categories of crimes are defined as follows:

(A) Crimes against peace refer to planning, preparing, and implementing aggression or war (whether declared or undeclared) in violation of international treaties and agreements.

(B) Violations of the laws and customs of war refer to crimes such as mistreating prisoners of war and civilians in occupied territories, killing protected enemy nationals, plundering property, and wantonly destroying cities or turning them into ruins beyond military necessity.

(C) Crimes against humanity refer to crimes such as killing, exterminating, enslaving, or deporting innocent people before or during war, and mistreating them for political or racial reasons. All other crimes that constitute a war crime, as well as all related crimes, are subject to trial. Whether a person is a planner, conspirator, leader, instigator, or accomplice, they are all subject to the jurisdiction of this Tribunal.

The nations invited to participate in this Tribunal include China, the United States, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, France, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand, each sending one prosecutor and one judge to form the organization. The prosecutor is appointed by the Supreme Commander of the United Nations and is responsible for all aspects of the prosecution.

In terms of trial procedures, after the criminal facts of a war criminal are established, the Tribunal presents an indictment to the defendant for review. The defendant has the right to defense, may use English or Japanese during the defense, and may freely choose their defense counsel or lawyer. However, the Tribunal may remove the defense counsel at any time. The defendant may present evidence in rebuttal and may question witnesses presented by the prosecutor. However, the defendant must apply in writing for permission from the Tribunal to present rebuttal evidence.

(4) The powers of the Tribunal and the execution of judgments are stipulated as follows: the Tribunal has the following five powers: 1. To summon witnesses to testify; 2. If the defendant refuses to answer questions from the Tribunal, to allow a person related to the defendant to express their views on their behalf; 3. To order the defendant to produce written documents or other evidence; 4. To administer oaths to witnesses in accordance with their national customs; 5. To employ staff as necessary to carry out the Tribunal's business.

(5) The trial procedures must go through the following process: 1. The indictment against each defendant must be read aloud in court; 2. Each defendant must be asked whether they plead guilty; 3. The prosecutor and each defendant must strive for brevity when expressing their views; 4. The admissibility of evidence presented by the prosecutor and each defendant is determined by the Tribunal; 5. The prosecutor and the defendant's defense counsel may question witnesses and the defendants involved; 6. Each defendant's defense counsel may express their views to the Tribunal; 7. The prosecutor may also express their views to the Tribunal. The Tribunal's judgment must be announced in open court.

(6) Regarding judgments and pronouncements, this Tribunal may sentence each defendant found guilty to death or other appropriate punishment. The judgment must be announced in open court and accompanied by a written statement of the reasons for the conviction. The record of the trial must be executed in accordance with the orders of the Supreme Commander of the United Nations. The Supreme Commander of the United Nations may at any time announce a reduction of sentence or modify it under the principle of not increasing the punishment and adopting other forms of punishment.

The International Military Tribunal for the Far East indicted Japanese war criminals on April 29 of last year and began its first hearing on May 3. Hearings continued on June 10.

### To Suppress the City's Food Prices, the Social Affairs Bureau Decides to First Sell Red Xian Rice; Regulations Stipulate That Participating Rice Businesses Must Provide Strict Guarantees

[Reported by this newspaper] The Shanghai General Grain Warehouse has been ordered to allocate a large quantity of white geng rice, red xian rice, and No. 2 Saigon rice to the municipal government for sale, in order to suppress the city's rice prices. The selling price is three to four thousand yuan lower than the negotiated price. The Social Affairs Bureau has now decided to first sell red xian rice, while the sale of white geng rice will be postponed until all procedures are complete.

Convening Responsible Parties to Discuss Prices

The Grain Section of the bureau specially convened responsible parties from rice businesses and the north and south markets on the previous two days to discuss the details of the selling prices and procedures. Attendees included Yue Xi-chao, Yin Fu-xiang, Hu Wen-an, and Hu Wei-gang, among others. The meeting was chaired by Section Chief Ji. The decisions were: (1) The selling price of red xian rice is 125,500 yuan per shi (unit of dry measure). (2) The quantity to be sold will be decided at any time. (3) The deposit for each bag is changed to 12,000 yuan. (4) The retail price at stores is 132,000 yuan per shi. (5) The net weight of 156 hands is equivalent to one shi, not including the bag's weight. Each burlap bag is calculated at 2.4 liang (unit of weight). (6) The market price, including delivery, transportation, and labor commission, is 125,000 yuan per shi. (7) The total amount of payment is changed to 163,000 yuan to be paid in advance for each bag, calculated at 1 shi and 2.5 dou (unit of dry measure).

Signed Statement Guaranteeing No Self-Dealing

In order to prevent rice merchants and businesses from engaging in fraud, the Social Affairs Bureau has specifically modeled the regulations after those for edible oil transactions, stipulating that participating rice businesses must provide guarantees. When signing the guarantee, rice merchants should indicate the business name, address, and the name of the responsible party, stating that the rice purchased will be completely distributed to various rice businesses in the city for actual sales and that they will be responsible for picking up the goods from the warehouse and delivering them to the respective rice businesses, guaranteeing no self-dealing or exceeding the specified prices. When signing the guarantee, rice businesses should indicate the business name, address, the name of the responsible party, and the quantity, stating that the rice will be entirely supplied for retail sales, guaranteeing no adulteration or exceeding the specified prices, and that the selling price will be prominently displayed at the store. Any violations will be subject to severe penalties.

According to Section Chief Ji, the Social Affairs Bureau will decide whether or not to sell based on the quantity of goods received, with 10,000 shi as the standard. If 6,000 shi arrive, 4,000 shi will be sold; if 8,000 shi arrive, 2,000 shi will be sold. Yesterday, over 10,000 shi arrived at the north and south markets, so the Social Affairs Bureau did not sell any, he said.

### Few Transactions, Unified Bonds Weak

Yesterday, with floating capital trending towards the stock market, large investors like Shilong and Runde made some settlements. Unified domestic bonds opened at 15,700 yuan, reaching a high of 16,000 yuan before falling to 14,000 yuan and then stabilizing. Transactions totaled less than 5 million yuan. As a result, Classes A, B, and E each fell by 700 to 800 yuan compared to last Saturday, while Class C fell by 1,000 yuan.

### Hong Kong Exchange Rate High, Stimulating Foreign Stocks

Yesterday, foreign stocks saw renewed buying pressure from investors due to the high Hong Kong exchange rate. Popular stocks such as Ewo and China Thread, etc., were once priced without a market, indicating an excess of demand over supply. Ewo experienced a sudden and strong surge in the morning, rising from 41,100 yuan, with eager buying, reaching a peak of 43,500 yuan before a large amount of profit-taking emerged, causing a sharp decline and a return. In the afternoon, due to some selling by industry insiders, it continued to decline to within 41,000 yuan. As a result, shipping increased by another 10% compared to last Saturday, while Hopewell and steel each rose by half a percent; the rest rose slightly.

### Banks and Businesses Subscribe to Bonds

[Reported by this newspaper] Yesterday, regarding the subscription of new bonds, various commercial banks and businesses, including Shanghai Steel, Jianye, Guohua, Yongda, Fuli Village, and Anyu Village, subscribed to a total of US$34,010 in short-term treasury bills. The Shanghai Trust Company subscribed to US$7,000 in short-term treasury bills. The Bank of China subscribed to US$33,000 in short-term treasury bills and US$10,600 in US dollar bonds. In addition, the Central Trust Bureau and the Bank of Communications each subscribed to several hundred US dollars in short-term treasury bills.

### Rice and Grain Market Closes Slightly Weak

Yesterday, approximately 12,000 shi of rice and grain arrived at the north and south markets. Because prices in the production areas continued to rise, geng rice in the early market continued to increase by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan, and xian rice also increased by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. White yuan, yin yuan, and yanshi were priced up 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. At noon, due to authorities' instructions not to exceed Saturday's market prices, the market closed slightly weak. There was still a large supply of southern geng rice, so fluctuations were minimal.

Flour increased by 1,000 yuan, while imported flour continued to increase by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan, and bran also increased by 2,000 yuan. Bean cake was selling well, rising first and then leveling out, with prices increasing by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan.

The supply of soybeans decreased significantly, and demand exceeded supply, causing prices to rise steadily, increasing by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Southern mung beans, after careful selection, were actively traded, increasing by another 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Southern red beans were being strongly bought, continuing to soar by 4,000 to 5,000 yuan.

Sorghum remained stable, corn remained mediocre, broad beans lacked transactions, raw peanuts were not available, sesame seeds were holding firm, and black sesame seeds, actively traded from Hong Kong, soared by 6,000 to 7,000 yuan.

### Chairman Chiang Kai-shek Emphasizes the Silk and Silkworm Cocoon Purchasing Plan

Leng Yu-qiu and Chu Fu-cheng paid a special visit to present their case yesterday

Jiangsu and Zhejiang Province natives residing in Shanghai, Ling Tong and Chu Fu-cheng, recognizing the impending silkworm season and the fact that this year's silk cocoon purchasing plan has not yet been finalized, which has a significant impact on the rural economy and foreign exchange earnings, took advantage of Chairman Chiang's presence in Shanghai to jointly visit him at Dongping Road yesterday morning. The Chairman personally received them. In addition to outlining the contents and progress of the repeated discussions held by the relevant silk and silkworm agencies and related organizations over the past two months regarding this year's silk cocoon purchasing methods, the two men emphasized the urgency of the situation and the importance of the issue, which could no longer be delayed. They specifically requested that the government promptly finalize measures to protect the capital of silkworm farmers and silk factories, in order to prevent farmers from becoming anxious and to increase foreign exchange income. The Chairman highly valued their opinions and indicated that upon his return to Nanjing, he would urge the Ministries of Agriculture and Economics to promptly submit the matter to the Executive Yuan for discussion and decision.
