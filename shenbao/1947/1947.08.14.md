### Committee for Guidance of Trade with Japan Decides on Types of Imports and Exports; Our Delegation of Twenty to Depart in Late Month

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 13th] The Committee for Guidance of Trade with Japan held its first meeting at 4:00 PM on the 13th. It was convened by Yang Shuren of the Ministry of Economic Affairs. Attendees included Zhu Xi and Pan Lu of the Ministry of Finance; Wu Zhaohong and Zheng Youkui of the National Resources Commission; Jin Shixuan of the Ministry of Communications; Li Jiecai of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs; Chen Zongjing of the Economic Affairs Commission; Zhang Yuanbing and Yang Jinsheng of the Central Trust of China; and Sun Zhongyue of the Export Promotion Commission. During the meeting, Yang Shuren first read out the "Organizational Measures and Implementation Outline for the Business Delegation to Japan" drafted by the Ministry of Economic Affairs. Attendees raised many opinions on the title of the delegation and other aspects. Finally, to save time, it was decided to first broadly exchange views on three major issues: the number of delegates, goods, and foreign exchange. Regarding the allocation of delegate numbers, it was decided that the number should not exceed twenty during the same period, with five from state-owned enterprises (one each from the China Textile Industries Corporation, China National Sericulture Corporation, and China National Plant Corporation; one from the Taiwan Sugar Corporation; one from the China Salt Company; one from the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company; and one from the Central Trust of China). Two would be from overseas Chinese merchants, and the remainder from industrial and commercial circles, with at least one from each of the nine regions of Shanghai, Tianjin, Qingdao, Hankou, Guangzhou, Fuzhou, Chongqing, Hefei, and the Northeast. The National Federation of Commerce and the Federation of Industry Associations would decide first, and then notify the local chambers of commerce and branches of industry associations across the country. In addition, public-private joint ventures may also participate in the delegation. Regarding the types of imports and exports, it was decided that exports would mainly consist of tung oil, pig bristles, hemp, and refined salt, but this would still need to be checked against the items decided by the Far Eastern Commission for additions and deletions. Imports would mainly be those needed by our country. Items that our country can manufacture or that affect our industrial products would not be imported. The main imports would be transportation equipment, railway sleepers, industrial equipment, parts, chemical raw materials, rayon, silkworm eggs, mulberry seedlings, and agricultural production equipment and raw materials. Regarding foreign exchange, it was decided that each delegate could not carry more than $500 USD during their three-week stay in Japan. For import and export foreign exchange, the clearing standard would use a bookkeeping system. After obtaining foreign exchange in Japan, exporters would hand it over to the Central Trust of China for bookkeeping, so that they can purchase a corresponding amount of Japanese goods. This method is roughly similar to the import and export linkage method. The detailed rules for the above decisions still need to be discussed further at the second meeting on the morning of the 16th before a final decision is made. Other issues are also expected to be fully decided at the next meeting, and then submitted to the Executive Yuan's political affairs meeting next Tuesday. The first group of delegates is expected to depart in late this month. The name of the delegation was not decided at today's meeting, and there will not be a head of the delegation.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 13th] The issue of allocating Japanese reparations materials to private industry was discussed at length at the Executive Yuan's political affairs meeting held at 4:00 PM on the 13th. The political committee members spoke very enthusiastically. The final decisions were: (1) The total amount of Japanese reparations materials is 480,000 tons, of which the original plan was to allocate more than 30,000 tons to private industry, but this is now increased to 82,000 tons. (2) The total cost for dismantling and constructing factories using all reparations materials is estimated at 170 million national currency and 50 million US dollars. (3) The first batch of 100,000 to 120,000 tons will be shipped to China within the year, with Shanghai as the primary port. The dismantling and relocation costs will require 27.8 million national currency and 110,000 US dollars. (4) The original plan was to send 222 personnel for the first batch of dismantling, loading, and receiving. It has now been decided to reduce this by 55 personnel to save costs. (5) Private industry will purchase the materials at a price of $800 USD per ton. (6) The entire dismantling process will take several years.

[United Press, Nanjing, 13th] Official sources say that government authorities and foreign trade experts are currently drafting a broad plan to support China's cotton yarn and textile industries in competing with Japanese exporters in the Nanyang market.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 13th] The Executive Yuan held its fifth temporary meeting at 4:00 PM on the afternoon of the 13th, chaired by Premier Zhang.

(3) The Organizational Regulations of the Commission for Supervising the Reception and Transportation of Japanese Reparations and Returned Materials were passed.

### Wedemeyer Reaches Shanghai Again; Immediately Proceeds to Inspect Guangzhou; Mission Did Not Participate in Discussions on Foreign Exchange Adjustments

[Our Newspaper Report] Special Envoy Wedemeyer and his party arrived in Shanghai from Taiwan at 3:00 PM yesterday. Those who welcomed him at Jiangwan Airport included Zhang Bide, representative of Mayor Wu; Chen Guolian, director of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Shanghai office; and Meyer, the U.S. Acting Consul General in Shanghai. Special Envoy Wedemeyer was still wearing the same light gray casual clothes as when he arrived in Shanghai last time, and was carrying a briefcase. After disembarking from the plane, he immediately took a special consulate car to the Silas Hard Guest House on Taft Road for rest. According to the mission's news advisor Watson, who told reporters at the airport, the group is scheduled to stay in Shanghai for two days, and will leave Shanghai for Guangzhou on the morning of the 15th.

In addition, the U.S. Consulate in Shanghai will hold a cocktail party at the Hamilton Building from 6:00 PM to 8:00 PM this afternoon to welcome Wedemeyer and his mission, and to entertain people from all walks of life. Regarding the suggestions previously provided by U.S. businessmen in this city regarding the Sino-U.S. Treaty of Commerce, the mission is currently organizing them. Since arriving in China, the mission has received a large number of reports and letters, with the most on finance coming from Shanghai, and the most on culture coming from Peiping. Furthermore, according to people close to the mission, the group did not participate in the issue of adjusting foreign exchange rates.

[Our Newspaper, Taipei, 13th] Envoy Wei left Taipei on a Samsung special plane at 8:20 AM on the 13th. He left the Taipei Guest House at 8:00 AM, and Chairman Wei Daoming accompanied him to the airport in the same car. After getting out of the car, he inspected the guard of honor, and amid the music of the military band, Envoy Wei walked to the square in front of the rest stop and shook hands with the welcomers one by one to bid farewell and wish them happiness, before boarding the plane and leaving. The special envoy's plane flew from Taipei to the central and southern parts of the island in the morning light, and turned to Kaohsiung via Pingtung. In Kaohsiung, he will also inspect the port, and is scheduled to stay for three hours, before flying to Shanghai on the same day.

[Central News Agency, Kaohsiung, 13th] Special Envoy Wedemeyer and his party flew from Taipei to Shanghai today. At 9:30 AM, the plane made a detour to Pingtung Airport and landed. They drove through the Kaohsiung city area and went straight to the Zuoying Naval Base for a visit. At 11:50 AM, they returned to Pingtung and took off for Shanghai at 12:00 PM.

[Associated Press, Nanjing, 13th] Taiwan News: General Wedemeyer, when meeting with Huang Chaoqin, Chairman of the Taiwan Provincial Assembly, stated to Huang that the United States has no secret plans for Taiwan, and that American aid to China is purely out of the sincerity and friendly relations between the two countries. In addition, Wedemeyer also held talks with administrative officials and people from industrial and commercial circles in Taiwan Province, and had an unexpected meeting with General Jia Youhui. Jia Youhui previously served as Wedemeyer's deputy commander in the New First Army when it received American-style training. It was also learned that the Taiwan Garrison Commander and Deputy Commander also held talks with Wedemeyer.

[Our Newspaper, Guangzhou, 13th] Wedemeyer and his party are scheduled to arrive in Guangzhou on the 15th. Originally, they planned to go to Hainan Island, and had ordered the Qiongyai District Commissioner's Office to prepare and provide information. It has now been learned that Wedemeyer will only stay in Guangzhou for two days, and the trip to Qiongyai is likely to be canceled.

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 13th] Brigadier General Suer, representing Special Envoy Wedemeyer, who came here to collect information, flew to Shenyang via Beijing at 10:00 AM on the 13th.

### Officials Manipulate Floating Capital; Hindering China's Revival

Envoy Wei Presents Views to Chairman

[Associated Press, Nanjing, 13th] It was learned today that Special Envoy Wedemeyer recently advised Chairman Jiang that government officials' acquisition and manipulation of floating capital is the main obstacle to China's revival.

### New Military Academy President; Actively Being Selected

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 12th] According to the Che Wen News Agency: The president of the new-style military academy being prepared by the Ministry of National Defense is currently being actively selected. It is said that the school is expected to complete all preparatory matters before October.

[Associated Press, Guangzhou, 13th] The rumor that Huangpu will be rebuilt as a commercial port to compete with Hong Kong, and that the plan will be completed within five years, is now rampant again. After Sun Liren, Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Army, recently made a short-term inspection of Huangpu, it has been rumored that Sun plans to use the area to train China's new army. Several old buildings of the Huangpu Military Academy still exist, and can be converted into barracks with slight repairs. The surrounding mountains can be used as excellent training areas for the army. Huangpu is close to the sea, and land transportation has a branch line connecting it to the Yuehan Railway. The convenience of transportation is probably the best in the country. Expanding Huangpu into a commercial port requires huge funds, materials, and engineering technology. This proposal was made before the war, but was abandoned due to the Japanese invasion of South China.

### Northeast Salt Exports; Still Far from Target

[Our Newspaper, Peiping, 13th] As of now this year, 400,000 dan of salt from the Northeast have been exported to South Korea. However, due to security concerns, the target of exporting 2 million dan is still far away. After the Northeast was recovered by the National Army, only Yingkou and four markets in western Liaoning remained. The annual production is 16 to 17 million dan, about half of the production during the enemy puppet period.

### Preliminary Peace Treaty Meeting; U.S. Proceeding Cautiously

Nanjing Possibly the Signing Location

[Central News Agency, Washington, 12th] The United States is still drafting a response to Moscow regarding the preliminary meeting on the Japanese peace treaty. Informed sources say that Washington is proceeding cautiously and is striving to get the Soviet Union to participate in future meetings. The suggestion by China that the final stage of the Japanese peace treaty meeting should be held in China has not received an official response. According to people paying attention to the situation in the Far East, Nanjing seems to logically be a possible place for the signing of the Japanese peace treaty, but it is too early to make a decision on this until the first stage of discussions is completed. Reports that MacArthur will return to Washington to attend the preliminary Japanese peace treaty meeting have not been confirmed by the White House and the Department of the Army, but it is said that MacArthur may attend the final signing ceremony of the Japanese peace treaty.

### Dihua Commemorates August 13th; Zhang Zhizhong and Song Xilian Deliver Speeches; Warn Countries with Aggressive Ambitions

[Central News Agency, Dihua, 13th] At 10:30 AM on the 13th, the garrison in Xinjiang held a grand meeting at the Xida Building to commemorate the 10th anniversary of the "August 13th" Songhu Anti-Japanese War and the "August 14th" Air Force Day.

Then, Song Xilian, Commander-in-Chief of the Xinjiang Garrison, reported on the course of the Songhu Anti-Japanese War. Both men issued warnings to countries with aggressive ambitions. Zhang said: "There are still people who are angering the Chinese people and stimulating the Chinese people. There is also another force in Xinjiang that is angering and stimulating the people of Xinjiang. I hope that these people will study the history of China's War of Resistance and understand the heroic feats shown by China in this war." Song said: "Any aggressor will fall before the banner of justice. The three fascist powers of Germany, Japan, and Italy were once very powerful at the beginning of the war, but in an instant they became historical remnants that stink for eternity. Countries with aggressive ambitions today should be alert to this." Wu Zexiang arrived in San Francisco on the same plane.

### Kong Xiangxi Arrives in New York

Wu Zexiang Arrives in San Francisco on the Same Plane

[Central News Agency, New York, 12th] Kong Xiangxi arrived in New York at 2:45 PM on the 12th.

He is also the chairman of the Bank of China, which has recently obtained the status of a bank engaged in international finance and commerce, so he plans to come to the United States to explore the possibility of supporting China's international trade. Kong said: "I have no official mission on this trip." He may go to Europe or other places to promote China's foreign trade. Wu Zexiang, the ambassador to Chile, arrived in San Francisco on the same plane as Kong.

### Punishing Bandits

### Democratic Socialist Party Reform Faction; To Open National Congress Tomorrow

[Our Newspaper Report] Wang Shiming, a senior member of the Democratic Socialist Party's reform faction, told reporters: "The party's National Congress is scheduled to open tomorrow and will not be postponed. The total number of delegates is about 70. The internal disputes of the Democratic Socialist Party have attracted the attention of the U.S. State Department. I was invited to meet with the U.S. Consul General yesterday to explain the situation in detail so that he can understand." Regarding the recent statement by the Democratic Constitutionalist Party that it would not unite with the reform faction, Wang believes that it is inaccurate.

[Central News Agency, This City News] Wu Xianzi, leader of the Democratic Constitutionalist Party, recently issued a statement through the party's San Francisco headquarters denying the combination with the reform faction of the Democratic Socialist Party and reaffirming the restoration of the original name of the Democratic Constitutionalist Party. He sent a message to Li Daming, the person in charge of the headquarters, on the 13th to explain, believing that the Democratic Constitutionalist Party could no longer cooperate with Zhang Junmai, so it combined with the reform faction. Because he did not withdraw from the Democratic Socialist Party at the beginning, there was no need to restore the organization of the Democratic Constitutionalist Party. He hoped that the headquarters would no longer object to his decision. He still does not agree with independence, and he has also decided to hold a National Congress on May 5th, and will

### Zeng Qi Issues Statement; Discussing the Strained Sino-Soviet Situation; Advocating Direct Negotiations Between the Two Countries

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 13th] On the second anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship on the 14th, Zeng Qi, chairman of the Youth Party, issued a statement saying: "When talking about Sino-Soviet relations, there are five points that we cannot forget and cannot ignore: (1) After the Soviet Union's revolution in 1917, it announced that it would abandon all rights of the Tsarist era in China, but the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship is just the opposite. On the Chinese side, in order to enhance friendly relations, it does not hesitate to pay a heavy price, while on the Soviet side, it is based on the Yalta secret agreement, which was not agreed to by China. In substance and form, it has the meaning of restoring all the rights of the Tsarist era. (2) Regarding the Chinese Eastern Railway, the Soviet Union has taken three contradictory measures before and after. Initially, it returned it to China according to its revolutionary words, and then it sold it without authorization to Japan, China's enemy during the Sino-Japanese War. Finally, it requested joint Sino-Soviet management. (3) In the exchange of notes of the Sino-Soviet Treaty and the agreement on Dalian, the Soviet government guaranteed to ensure China's jurisdiction over all the sovereignty of the three northeastern provinces, regarding it as "an inseparable part of China." However, two years after the signing of the treaty, Lushun and Dalian have not yet been handed over, and there have been actions that are contrary to friendship, such as: First, transporting away industrial machinery. Second, equipping the Chinese Communist army with Japanese weapons. Third, organizing Korean communist Japanese prisoners to assist the Chinese Communists in attacking the National Army. I don't know where China's sovereignty will be placed. (4) Regarding the Xinjiang issue, the Soviet Union also stated in the treaty exchange of notes that it would not interfere in China's internal affairs, but now it has instigated Outer Mongolia to invade Xinjiang, which is an open secret. (5) The treaty clearly stipulates that both parties agree to open Dalian as a free port, but now China cannot even enter the city of Dalian, let alone the friendly nations of Britain and the United States. Lushun and Dalian have become one of the Soviet Union's iron curtains, which is a major threat to peace in the Far East. I believe that the long-term stalemate in Sino-Soviet relations is not a blessing for world peace. There are only three ways to solve this problem: (1) Direct negotiations between the diplomatic authorities of China and the Soviet Union to thoroughly review where the responsibility for fulfilling the treaty lies. If necessary, a new treaty can be signed, extending it from thirty years to fifty years. China has no intention of invading the Soviet Union, which should be believed by the world. (2) Britain and the United States should come forward to mediate, and use the compromise of the five-nation foreign ministers meeting. (3) Arbitration by the UN Security Council. The first approach is still the best, because we sincerely hope that China and the Soviet Union can automatically reconcile and have half a century of peace, without the need for a third party to mediate. If the first approach does not work, then the second and third approaches can also be chosen. In short, the stalemate must be broken, and it must not be allowed to drag on, so as to cause unpredictable disasters."

### Kunming Volunteer Soldiers Numbering Nine Hundred; Accepted by New Soldiers Brigade Yesterday

### Sixteen Counties in Yunnan Report Disasters; Provincial Food Office to Re-Survey

### Yunnan-Guizhou Direct Tax Bureaus Merge

From September 1st, it will officially merge with the Guizhou District Direct Tax Bureau for office, and be renamed the Yunnan-Guizhou Direct Tax Bureau. The bureau address is still in Kunming, and the candidate for bureau director has not been determined. The bureau is currently awaiting the Ministry's order to reorganize.

### Zhang Junmai Gives Talk in Guling; Wei's Visit Related to Stabilizing People's Livelihood; Advocates Party Nomination for Election Issues

[Our Newspaper, Guling, 13th] Zhang Junmai arrived in Guling at 8:40 PM on the 13th. Those who came with him included his foreign female secretary, Miss Mai Luona, etc. They stayed at Zhang Jia'ao's residence. Zhang left the Jingxi Hotel in Beijing on the 12th and arrived in Xunzhou at 5:00 PM on the 13th before ascending Lushan. Our reporter interviewed Zhang that night and asked about the opinions he raised during the meeting with Wedemeyer in Shanghai. Zhang avoided answering this question, but said: "Wei's visit will be of great help to our country. As for how the United States will provide assistance, it all depends on the results of Wei's investigation this time." Zhang said: "Wei expressed his most friendly attitude during the talks, hoping that our country's politics would move towards democracy, and hoping that our people's lives could be stabilized. Zhang believes that Wei's visit will have a significant relationship with stabilizing the lives of the people, and whether the people's lives can be stabilized depends on whether politics are clarified as a prerequisite.

[Our Newspaper, Guling, 13th] When Zhang Junmai received our reporter on the evening of the 13th, he talked about the recent disputes in the Democratic Socialist Party. He pointed out three points: (1) Some people say that he is dictatorial, but this is not the case. He is open about everything. (2) Most of the overseas party members support him. They have no problem supporting the Democratic Socialist Party. (3) After Wu Xianzi left the Democratic Socialist Party, the government should have considered filling the vacancy in his government committee, but the Democratic Socialist Party does not intend to recommend a successor. During the conversation, Zhang criticized Li Daming and others for not understanding the national conditions, such as hoping that he would serve as the President of the Executive Yuan, and that the Democratic Socialist Party should have four government committee members, two ministers, and one political committee member, etc. In fact, he himself would never be able to serve as the President of the Executive Yuan. Zhang expressed optimism about the disputes in the Democratic Socialist Party, believing that overseas representatives had participated in the recent National Congress, so the matter of the Democratic Constitutionalists leaving the party was not serious. Regarding the election issue, he advocated the party nomination method. It is said that in the general election this autumn, the Kuomintang hopes that people from all parties and factions will participate, but the strength of the various parties and factions is difficult to compete with the Kuomintang. The party nomination method is to make a proportional stipulation for the candidates, not to make a proportional stipulation for the election results. The final decision-making power is still in the hands of the voters. Members of the Democratic Socialist Party will participate in the election, which will be controlled by the party. The Central Party Headquarters of the Democratic Socialist Party has established a general election office to preside over the matter.

### Principles for Adjusting the Treatment of Public Education and Military Personnel; Regardless of Region, the Basic Amount is Increased by 10 Million

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 13th] The adjustment of the treatment of public education personnel and military personnel has been decided by the Executive Yuan. It is understood that the adjustment will be based on the following principles: (1) Military personnel and public education personnel will be treated equally and retired equally, and it is decided to implement this from this month. (2) In the past, the standard for public education personnel was divided into five regional levels, but this time it will be reduced to four regional levels. (3) In the past, the applicable levels for various cities have changed greatly due to different price increases and decreases and different cost-of-living indexes in the past three months. (4) This adjustment will increase the basic amount by 100,000 yuan regardless of the region. The plan formed according to the above principles will be finalized after the State Council meeting on the 15th.

### The Question of Foreign Investment in China: Director Dong Publishes Chairman Zhang's Statement

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 13th] Director Dong Xianguang of the Executive Yuan's Information Bureau, at a press conference on the 13th, released the following statement from Chairman Zhang of the Executive Yuan regarding foreign investment in Chinese industry:

Regarding the issue of foreign investment and technical cooperation in China, the Chinese government, through the former Supreme National Defense Council, has explicitly stipulated the principles for the first phase of post-war economic construction. Furthermore, Chinese laws such as the Company Law and Mining Law have been promulgated, and explicit provisions exist for foreign companies, Sino-foreign joint ventures, participation in share capital, and acquisition of mining rights. Relevant provisions are also included in the Sino-foreign commercial treaties currently under negotiation. To ensure that foreign investors understand the policies held by the Chinese government, the Chinese government will further explain the following items:

Regarding the Scope of Industries in Which Foreign Companies Can Directly Invest

The term "direct investment" in this context is interpreted as referring to foreign companies investing in China under the names of foreigners or foreign legal entities, operating independently in the manufacturing industry. All industries, except those that should be state-owned as specified in the second section of this statement and those that Chinese laws stipulate should be operated by Chinese individuals or Chinese legal entities, can be directly invested in by foreign companies. For example, the manufacturing industries of large-scale power engines, machine tools, automobiles, motorcycles, airplanes, and larger ships are particularly welcome.

(2) Regarding the Scope of State-Owned Industries Stipulated by the Chinese Government

The Chinese government reserves the industries that are entirely state-owned. According to item B of Article 2 of the first phase of economic construction principles, the types of enterprises exclusively operated by the government are not intended to be excessive, including armories, mints, major railways, and large-scale hydroelectric power plants.

According to Articles 9 and 10 of the Mining Law, various minerals should be state-owned. However, such state-owned mining enterprises can still be operated jointly with private citizens or foreigners, or leased to private management.

(3) Regarding the Scope of Industries That Can Allow Simultaneous State-Owned and Private Operation, and Joint Public-Private Operation, and the Treatment Enjoyed

Regarding this issue, Article 2 of the first phase of economic construction principles already has specific provisions. The relevant items are excerpted as follows: (A) Enterprises not designated for exclusive government operation (except those restricted by law) can be operated by private citizens. (B) For enterprises that private resources cannot adequately undertake, or that the government considers require special attention, such as large-scale oil mines, steel plants, and shipping enterprises, the government may still operate them independently or jointly with private or foreign capital. (C) Enterprises jointly operated by the government and private or foreign capital should adopt a company system. The government, in addition to exercising administrative supervision according to law, should exercise its management of the company's business and personnel in the position of a shareholder. (D) Enterprises operated by the government, except those exclusively operated by the government, whether operated independently or jointly with private or foreign capital, if they have commercial characteristics, enjoy the same rights and obligations as similar private enterprises.

The Chinese government particularly welcomes foreign companies to jointly invest with Chinese citizens in establishing industries. In addition, regarding the allocation and settlement of foreign exchange, the allocation of raw materials, loans, and import permit quotas, these are handled in accordance with the current foreign exchange control regulations and the "Provisional Regulations for Amendment of Import and Export Trade" promulgated in the 1936th year. State-owned enterprises and private enterprises are treated equally, and no preferential rights are allowed.

(4) Regarding the Scope of Industries Not Allowed for Foreign Company Operation

According to item 2 of paragraph 1 of Article 293 of the Chinese Company Law, the business areas and types of foreign companies can be restricted.

(5) Regarding Laws and Customs Duties

Chinese tax laws stipulate that foreign businesses operating within Chinese territory shall be subject to the same tax rates as domestic citizens, which should not hinder the acquisition of reasonable industrial profits.

(6) Regarding Whether Profits from Investment Can Be Remitted Back to Foreign Countries, and Whether Foreign Exchange Can Be Purchased for Necessary Materials and Labor That Must Be Imported from Foreign Countries

In principle, profits earned by foreign companies investing in industry in China can be remitted back to foreign countries. During the current period of foreign exchange control in China, this is of course subject to time limits. However, the government is currently formulating measures to allow an appropriate portion of profits earned by foreign companies investing in industry to be remitted back to their home countries. As for materials and labor required for business operations that must be imported from foreign countries, these will of course be reviewed and approved in accordance with the "Provisional Regulations for Amendment of Import and Export Trade" during the period of foreign exchange control.

(7) Regarding the Issue of Local Governments Promulgating Regulations Concerning Foreign Business Operations

The promulgation of all current important local regulations has been approved by the central government, which should not violate the Chinese government's policy of welcoming foreign investment or hinder merchants from operating their businesses according to sound principles.

[United Press, this city] Foreign merchants here are very interested in Chairman Zhang's call for foreigners to invest in China. However, they stated that they had heard similar measures before and will temporarily reserve comment "pending the realization of this matter." One important foreigner stated that building heavy industries, such as the manufacturing of ships, locomotives, automobiles, and machine tools, could solve China's economic problems, but this matter is quite difficult. The current inflation almost makes it difficult to proceed immediately, although such industries could prevent inflation, the current inflation is sufficient to hinder the opportunity for these industries to appear.

### Yulin in Northern Shaanxi Completely Relieved; Linzi County Town Recovered in Eastern Shandong

[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 13th] The bandits attacking Yulin besieged the city with all their might for seven days and nights, but ultimately failed. By dawn on the 12th, the bandits' momentum was exhausted. The national army, advancing directly to Yulin from Jingbian, joined forces with the defending troops inside the city on the evening of the 12th. The communists fled eastward in disarray. This elite force had twice defeated strong resistance from the bandits in Yangjia Town and Wuding River, southwest and west of Yulin, before reaching Yulin. Currently, the national army is pursuing and attacking Zhenchuan Fort and Mizhi. Another unit of the national army also occupied Shiwanzhen on the night of the 12th, and the bandits fled eastward.

### Communist Bandits Use UNRRA Materials for Combat; UNRRA Staff List Facts to Prove

[United Press, New York, 13th] Howard, a reporter for Newton, reported from Shanghai that, according to eyewitness accounts from UNRRA American staff in the Communist-controlled areas, the Communist army has used UNRRA materials for combat.

Communist spokespersons have repeatedly accused the National Government of interfering with the transportation of UNRRA materials and have insisted that relief materials transported to the Communist-controlled areas must be distributed on a fair and equal basis and must never be used for military purposes. However, reports from UNRRA staff reveal: (1) On July 17th, a food warehouse in Fugou, a major distribution point in the UNRRA Henan flood relief area, was stormed by a group of Communist troops, and food was taken away. (2) On the same day, Communist troops used weapons to force UNRRA inspectors to order UNRRA staff to repair machine guns for the Communist army. This incident occurred at the UNRRA Zhengqiao Machine Factory. (3) On July 18th, Communist troops again occupied the UNRRA warehouse in Fugou and used small carts to move relief supplies (including flour and canned food). (4) On July 18th, Communist troops seized nine trucks and four jeeps. UNRRA Chinese drivers were forced to drive for them. After repeated negotiations by UNRRA, these vehicles were returned after they had been used to transport troops to the war zone. (5) On July 19th, one UNRRA truck was seized and sent to the front line. Later, eight more trucks were forced to transport wounded Communist soldiers. It is said that these vehicles are still in the hands of the Communist army. (6) On July 25th, five Communist soldiers robbed UNRRA materials and punctured the tires of the trucks, claiming that they would not allow the National Army to use them.

### Government Decides to Continue Repaying Pre-War Foreign Debts; Director Dong Explains China's Sincerity in Maintaining Creditworthiness

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 13th] When a reporter asked what the government would do about the fact that the Chinese government had not resumed repayment of various pre-war foreign debts since suspending payments in 1939, Director Dong replied today:

The Chinese government solemnly expresses its determination to resume repayment of various foreign debts suspended during the Sino-Japanese War. The various new debts raised in recent years do not hinder the collateral of pre-war debts or harm the rights and interests of the holders of those debts. At the same time, the Chinese government hopes to maintain its policy of maintaining creditworthiness and will soon gradually reorganize old debts.

Looking back at the years before the war, the Chinese government resolved many old outstanding cases left over from the former Beijing government. There was significant progress in reorganizing foreign debts. Unfortunately, these arduous efforts were destroyed by the Japanese enemy's invasion.

During the first year and a half of the war, although customs duties, which guaranteed foreign debts, were severely hindered by the war, the Chinese government continued to maintain its debts as scheduled and repaid the principal and interest in full. Amid this unprecedented national crisis, this achievement seems sufficient to demonstrate China's sincerity in striving to maintain creditworthiness.

By the spring of 1939, almost all of China's main tax revenues were controlled by the enemy. The Chinese government was forced to temporarily suspend various debt payments. Creditors in various countries were able to sympathize with and understand this measure. The Chinese government is deeply grateful.

China's war of resistance lasted the longest and suffered the greatest losses in this world war against aggression. Now that the war is over, China's economic and financial recovery work has only just begun, and the urgent need for reconstruction funds constitutes a difficult burden on current finances, especially in terms of foreign exchange. On the other hand, the restoration of normal operations in all sectors of national industry, commerce, transportation, and tax administration will take a considerable amount of time. Today's China, like most other countries after the war, still needs to rely on international economic assistance to develop industry and commerce in order to cultivate debt repayment capabilities.

Even so, the Chinese government is determined to make its best efforts to fulfill its debt repayment obligations and sincerely hopes that the financial situation can be improved as soon as possible so that pre-war debts can be restored for repayment as soon as possible.

[United Press, Nanjing, 13th] According to unofficial estimates, China's pre-war foreign debt totaled approximately $500 million, £51 million, 138 million French francs, 53 million Belgian francs, and 30 million Dutch guilders. Repayment work was suspended in the spring of 1939 due to the war.

### Striving for Diplomatic Initiative – Reflections on the Second Anniversary of the Sino-Soviet Treaty

It has been two years since the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship. The signing of this treaty inevitably cast a heavy shadow on the minds of the Chinese people. In the early days of the War of Resistance, we were grateful for the assistance from our great northern neighbor. Unexpectedly, as our historical struggle was nearing victory, such a treaty of friendship was signed. Precisely because of friendship, the Chinese people, with the spirit of a warrior severing his arm, harbored no complaints or resentment about the signing of this treaty; instead, they placed ardent hopes on it. They hoped that through the signing of this treaty, Sino-Soviet relations would embark on a new chapter. However, the developments of the past two years have not only failed to meet the expectations of the Chinese people but have also left them with a sense of disillusionment about the future. Today, on the second anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, no Chinese person can avoid a heavy heart.

Since the October Revolution, the Chinese people have consistently held deep concern and sincere expectations for their northern neighbor. During China's National Revolution, they were the first to witness Lenin declare the abolition of the privileges obtained by the Tsarist era in China, voluntarily relinquishing various privileges in China. Needless to say, this created a good impression in the minds of the Chinese people. Later, as the National Revolution unfolded in the Pearl River basin, the Soviet Union provided moral support. Despite the existence of the Communist bandits, the Chinese people regarded them as an internal problem and consistently refrained from involving it in Sino-Soviet relations. The Soviet government's support for us in the early stages of the War of Resistance further proved that the views held by the Chinese people were not mistaken. China and the Soviet Union share a land border of unparalleled length. What the Chinese people hope for is to live in peace and harmony with our northern neighbor and to foster even closer relations. It was under this sentiment that we witnessed the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship.

Unfortunately, the development of Sino-Soviet relations in the past two years has been deeply disappointing. Two years have passed since the cessation of hostilities against Japan, yet our entire sovereignty over the Northeast has not yet been fully recovered. Although Lushun (Port Arthur) and Dalian are to be special zones according to the previous treaty, the special status stipulated in the treaty has not yet materialized. Two years have passed since the end of the war against Japan, yet the officials sent by China to Dalian have not been able to assume their posts. As for the stripping of industrial and mining equipment, the lingering presence of Japanese prisoners of war, the armed influx of Korean people, and the occupation by the Communist bandits, objective and detailed reports have long been provided by impartial journalists. We abandoned Outer Mongolia with the spirit of a warrior severing his arm, originally hoping that the situation in the Northeast would become simpler; alas, the developments of the past two years have greatly deviated from our expectations! Moreover, what makes us even more disappointed is that not only is the Northeast in such a state, but Xinjiang and the Northwest are also facing multiple troubles. Outer Mongolia's invasion of Xinjiang included the overt participation of Soviet aircraft in combat, and the Soviet Union even supported Outer Mongolia's fabrication of evidence regarding the Sino-Mongolian border. It can be said that over the past two years, we have demonstrated our greatest friendship through the signing of this Treaty of Friendship; however, the actions of the Soviet Union clearly do not align with the spirit of friendship. Now, on the second anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, as we look ahead to the future of Sino-Soviet relations, we cannot help but express our heavy hearts, approximately as follows:

First, the developments of the past two years not only clearly indicate that the Soviet Union lacks the sincerity to fulfill its obligations under the aforementioned treaty, but also, on the one hand, supports Outer Mongolia's invasion of our territory, and on the other hand, provides support to the Communist bandits in our country. Its actions are, in fact, manifestly unfriendly. Under these circumstances, our unilateral negotiations with the Soviet Union seem to have little significance. At this time, we should urgently take diplomatic initiative, making public to the world the process of the development of Sino-Soviet relations over the past two years, at least so that world opinion and future historians can see the full picture of this development and reach a fair judgment. Furthermore, disputes between nations, such as disputes over the interpretation of treaties, have internationally recognized peaceful resolution methods. If Sino-Soviet opinions regarding the interpretation of the treaty cannot be reconciled, resulting in our failure to fully recover sovereignty over the Northeast, we can certainly appeal to permanent international institutions for their impartial adjudication. In this era of darkness and an extremely bleak diplomatic situation, our efforts should be focused on dispelling the gloom and making the future situation increasingly clear.

Second, we must point out that the development of Sino-Soviet relations to the current stage is mainly due to our inheriting a legacy in which we had no say. Yalta was a major adventure in international politics; it can also be said to have been a major gamble. Unfortunately, President Roosevelt passed away before the war against Japan was over and before the Soviet Union had participated in the war against Japan. Due to this "fait accompli," we witnessed the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship. As we reflect on the development of Sino-Soviet relations over the past two years, we cannot help but think of Yalta. Although President Roosevelt is now gone, the responsibility that the United States bears for future international politics, especially in the Far East, has not diminished with the president's death; on the contrary, it has assumed an even greater moral responsibility. How Sino-Soviet relations will develop in the future, as in the past, will be largely determined by how Soviet-American relations develop. Only under this broader perspective can we properly address the evolution of Sino-Soviet relations.

Needless to say, we have always cherished the friendship of the Soviet Union; although the current stage of Sino-Soviet relations is not ideal, we always hope that the two great neighbors, China and the Soviet Union, can become increasingly friendly. We harbor no anti-Soviet sentiment, and we certainly do not hope for a deterioration in U.S.-Soviet relations. We hope that they can restore the harmony they had during the war, allowing the post-war world situation to become increasingly stable. Today, on the second anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, looking around at the domestic and international situation, we cannot help but feel a multitude of emotions; doing our best, we should strive to seize the initiative in our diplomacy at this moment, so that the future diplomatic situation can become increasingly clear!

### U.S. to Take Active Measures to Safeguard Peace in the Balkans; Greek Independence Must Not Be Threatened Again

[Reuters News Agency, Lake Success, 12th] The United States stated frankly in the Security Council today that if action in the Balkans is undermined by the veto, the United States is prepared to take independent measures to maintain peace. U.S. Representative Johnson, in his most impassioned speech, accused the Communists of being responsible for the unrest in Greece and directly accused Greece's northern neighbors of being aggressors. He stated, "The U.S. government is now prepared to join with any other member state of the United Nations to take measures to help Greece maintain its independence. The complete deadlock created within the UN framework on the Balkan issue has extinguished any hope for a compromise solution. There is no need to bow to the threat of the veto any longer. It is now time to record our honest opinions. The United States believes that Greece has been seriously threatened by guerrillas supported by Albania, Bulgaria, and Yugoslavia, as well as by the Greek Communist Party, whose goal is to establish a totalitarian government subservient to Communist-controlled countries. The United States will not stand idly by while Greece's territorial integrity and national independence are repeatedly challenged. We do not believe that our obligations within the UN framework end simply because our goals are thwarted by the veto. This use of the veto is clearly protecting the aggression of Albania, Bulgaria, and Yugoslavia. We are willing to declare unequivocally that we will not hesitate to use every possible method within the scope of the Charter to maintain international peace and provide Greece with the necessary protection. The U.S. government believes that the Security Council's failure to take effective action due to the Soviet Union's use of the veto does not preclude other countries from taking individual or collective action, as long as such action is consistent with the general goals and principles of the United Nations. With regard to the Soviet Union's use of the veto to obstruct the Security Council's actions, we firmly believe that the UN General Assembly may still fully exercise its authority to safeguard Greece. The United States is prepared to implement any recommendations made by the General Assembly to resolve this issue. The United States is also prepared to cooperate with member states of the United Nations who share the same aspirations, taking any necessary steps within the scope of the General Assembly's recommendations or the Charter, to provide Greece with the safeguards it is entitled to enjoy under the Charter." Johnson was referring to Article 51 of the Charter. The U.S. representative also submitted a resolution requesting the Security Council to ascertain that Albania, Bulgaria, and Yugoslavia were indeed supporting Greek guerrillas, thereby constituting a threat to peace as described in Chapter VII of the Charter. The resolution further requested the three countries to cease their assistance to Greek guerrillas and instructed the UN Balkan Committee to closely monitor developments. The Council subsequently announced an adjournment until Thursday to continue the debate.

### Guerrilla Warfare in Greece Enters a New Phase

[Reuters News Agency, Jannina, Northern Greece, 12th] The guerrilla warfare in Greece appears to have entered a new phase, with rebels, sheltered and supplied by neighboring countries, gradually increasing their actions to intrude and harass Greek territory. Although the state of shock caused by the recent invasion of the city of Konitsa by 2,000 guerrillas from Albania is gradually fading, observers generally agree that such incidents will occur frequently along the 600-mile border of northern Greece in the future. One of the reasons for the increase in foreign guerrillas may be the hope that the army, after four months of suppression, has driven most of the guerrillas out of the country. The Greek government's previous claim that the invading forces included international brigades has not yet been confirmed.

### Attlee's Economic Emergency Bill Passed by British House of Lords; Bill to Be Submitted to King for Signature

[United Press International, London, 13th] The British House of Lords approved Prime Minister Attlee's Economic Emergency Bill on the 13th, granting the government "dictatorial" powers over industry and labor. The bill had already been passed by the House of Commons.

[Associated Press, Lake Success, 12th] The Security Council discussed the Indonesian issue tonight and, despite opposition from Britain, the United States, and Belgium, decided to invite Indonesian representatives to participate in the meeting. The vote was 8 to 3. Although the Netherlands led the opposition, it is not a member of the Council and has no voting rights. At that time, former Indonesian Prime Minister Sjahrir was sitting in the audience and was immediately invited to the conference table. Foreign Minister Salim of that country followed suit. The vote was on a procedural matter, not a substantive one, so the negative votes cast by Britain and France were not considered an exercise of the veto. Dutch representative van Kleffens immediately requested that the Council also allow representatives from East Indonesia and Borneo to present their views. The Council then adjourned until Sunday afternoon to hear Sjahrir's views.

### U.S. to Lend Japan a Large Sum, Totaling About $500 Million Largely Decided; Rumors U.S. Plans to Lend Another $600 Million with Gold and Silver as Collateral

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 13th] It is reported that negotiations for Japan to borrow $400 to $500 million from the United States are nearing completion. Of the loan, $300 million will be used to assist Japan in purchasing raw materials and other industrial necessities needed to manufacture export products. This loan will be used as a revolving fund, from which to pay for essential imports such as raw materials and machinery, while the profits from goods manufactured from these raw materials will remain in the fund. The purchase of raw cotton will be financed by a loan from the North American Cotton Company, to be repaid in manufactured goods within six months. This loan is approximately $150 million. It is rumored that the United States also intends to lend Japan $600 million, with gold and silver stored in the Bank of Japan as collateral. However, due to the limitations of factory capacity and the lack of fuel, Japan cannot utilize such a large loan. Since the surrender, the value of gold and silver stored in the Bank of Japan is approximately $250 million. However, at the beginning of the occupation, the Allied Headquarters announced that $43,517,600 of the gold and silver belonged to Thailand, and $37,023,630 belonged to Vietnam.

### Part of Gold Should Belong to Our Country

In addition, silver ingots worth $314,572 and gold ingots worth $680,015 belong to the Chinese puppet United Reserve Bank. As a result, $80 million of the gold and silver must be returned to Thailand, Vietnam, and China respectively, with the remaining value of approximately $200 million. The United States originally intended to use this as reparations. Therefore, the current U.S. lending to Japan is actually sacrificing a large amount of reparations and providing a loan that is three times that amount. Furthermore, the U.S. loan can only be used to purchase raw materials and other necessities for manufacturing exports and cannot be used for domestic reconstruction work.

### U.S. Soldier Sentenced to Life Imprisonment for Raping Japanese Woman

### British and American Experts Meet in Washington to Review Increase in Ruhr Coal Production; This Move Has Major Implications for Marshall Plan

[Associated Press, Washington, 12th] British and American officials are holding a meeting here today to increase Ruhr coal production. Both sides recognize that the outcome of the meeting has significant implications for the success of the Marshall Plan. Seven countries depend on the supply of Ruhr coal for their recovery, which is as important as food. The meeting will develop a detailed plan to gradually increase Ruhr coal production. The U.S. government will increase current production from 220,000 tons per day to approximately 300,000 tons by December, and then to 350,000 tons. The British attitude is that the increase in coal production depends on resolving other fundamental issues, such as finance, food, and transportation. The U.S. State Department is unwilling to discuss this.

[Associated Press, Washington, 13th] The British and American Ruhr coal production conference entered its second day today. Representatives from both sides are trying to solve the transportation problem in western Germany in order to transport coal produced in the Ruhr region to factories in Germany and other neighboring countries. Due to a severe shortage of railway cars and locomotives, millions of tons of coal are currently piled up near the mines.

### Ban on Dancing Affects Tax Revenue; Should Be Gradually Phased Out; Director Wu's Remarks in Nanjing Before Returning to Shanghai

[Report from our Nanjing office, 13th] After arriving in Nanjing, Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau Director Wu Kaixian met with Minister Gu and others of the Ministry of Social Affairs to discuss the Shanghai dance ban and the handling of the Shanghai election. Having completed his official duties, he is scheduled to return to Shanghai by train on the evening of the 13th. According to Director Wu, Mayor Wu mentioned the dance ban when he visited the Chairman in Nanjing last time. The Mayor elaborated on the impact of this matter on Shanghai's fiscal revenue. Director Wu believes that to abolish dancing, one should first restrict the establishment of dance halls, impose high taxes to gradually phase them out, rather than completely ban them in a short period of time. According to an important official in Shanghai, many people in Shanghai depend on dancing for a living, and many Chinese and foreigners consider it a legitimate form of entertainment. Completely banning it would not only affect prosperity but also affect public security. Implementing thrift and banning dancing should also be done gradually.

### Dismissal Pay Issue; Arbitration Committee Holds Subcommittee Meeting; Labor and Management Argue Fiercely

[Report from our news desk] Labor and management in the city have been in dispute over the issue of dismissal pay for workers with indefinite contracts. The seven-member subcommittee of the Labor-Management Arbitration Committee met again at the Bureau of Social Affairs yesterday, chaired by Li Jianhua. During the meeting, the committee members from both labor and management argued vigorously. The management representatives demanded the abolition of the arbitration committee's methods, arguing that there was no legal basis for them and that they should be handled entirely in accordance with the Factory Law. The labor representatives argued that the Factory Law was enacted a long time ago and does not conform to the actual situation, so they have requested the central government to amend it. The Factory Law was formulated before the war in times of peace, when it was easier to find work after being dismissed. Therefore, the payment of dismissal pay was less. Now that industry and commerce are declining, it is very difficult for workers to find new jobs once they are unemployed, and the payment of dismissal pay is to help them maintain a bare minimum of living during the transition period. The Labor-Management Arbitration Committee's regulations on dismissal pay, at least half a month's pay and at most three months' pay, are based on factual circumstances and have been submitted to the Ministry of Social Affairs for record and implementation, so they cannot be changed. As the two sides could not reach an agreement, the subcommittee decided to submit the opinions of both labor and management to the Ministry of Social Affairs for a decision.

He was conscripted into the army in his hometown and departed with the troops to Shandong. When passing through Nantong, due to physical weakness, he was discharged and stayed in Nantong.

### Extradition of American Soldier for Confrontation: Quelly Provides Detailed Account of Incident; Based on Court's Autopsy Report, Maley More Likely to Have Fired the Gun

[Our Dispatch] The case of Englishman Quelly and American Army Corporal Maley conspiring to murder black market gold broker Yu Shengxiao has been investigated repeatedly by both the American and Chinese military police in recent days, and after examining Yu Shengxiao's body, many new clues have been discovered.

Since Quelly was brought by the Criminal Investigation Division of the US Military Police Headquarters to testify, the police department subsequently extradited Maley to the bureau for confrontation with Quelly. Both sides continued to shift responsibility to each other. However, judging from various signs, Maley's suspicion of murder is more obvious.

During this interrogation, Quelly provided a more detailed account than before. He said that while driving past the Hongqiao Club, he suddenly heard Maley threatening loudly and forcibly grabbing Yu Shengxiao, ordering him to "lie down." Yu struggled at the time, which resulted in him being struck hard with the gun handle. Following this, Maley immediately fired a shot. When he heard the shot, he slowed down the car, but Maley continued to order him to drive forward, telling him to turn into any side road they encountered.

Abandoning the Body in the Woods

When they reached the Qinghu border, Maley ordered him to stop because there were trees along the road. Then he saw Maley open the car door and drag the injured Yu Shengxiao out of the car, resulting in mud on his leather shoes and bloodstains on his socks. Afterwards, Maley even ordered him to drive forward. At this time, Maley picked up a towel that Yu Shengxiao had tied around his arm to wipe sweat with, and used it to wipe the bloodstains in the car. After driving for a short while, Maley ordered him to turn east. When they drove past the crime scene, Maley threw the bloodstained towel out of the car. After entering the city, they first went to his residence to rest briefly, and then drove out again. At that time, he intended to sell a gold bar first for their expenses, but because it was too late, it was difficult to sell despite trying everywhere. Later, he drove to the Huizhong Hotel.

Bullet Head Recovered

On the way, Maley found a bullet head on the floor of the front seat and raised it to him, saying, "Do you see that?" He immediately put it into his pocket.

Quelle also added that there was no magazine in the gun. He said that after Maley shot Yu Shengxiao, when he glanced back, he saw Maley throw something that looked very much like a magazine out of the car. However, Maley's statement to the police was that Yu Shengxiao was shot and killed by Quelly who turned around from the front seat and shot him, then ordered him to open the car door and throw the body out. As for the five gold bars, Quelly first ordered him to place them on the empty seat in the front, and then took the opportunity to attack him when he leaned over. At that time, because the gun was in Quelly's hand, he had to obey his orders.

Injured Area

According to the police department, based on the court's autopsy results, the bullet entered from the eighth rib behind the left side and exited from the third rib in front of the right side, moving upwards. Therefore, based on the reasoning, it is generally believed that Maley was more likely to have fired the gun.

The towel mentioned above is actually an important key to solving this case. When the police department investigated the scene of the incident, they first found this bloodstained towel. Later, after comparing it with the bloodstains on Maley's socks, they discovered that it was the same blood type, and determined that Maley was indeed an accomplice in the murder.

### American Military Representatives Inquire About the Condition of the Corpse Examination

[Further News] At around 9:00 AM yesterday, representatives from the Criminal Investigation Division of the US Army Headquarters in China, Cos and an assistant, went to the forensic office of the District Procuratorate to inquire about the autopsy of Yu Shengxiao's body. The assistant took off his coat, and forensic doctor Wang Sijian used a pen to outline the wounds on his body, performing a demonstration on the spot, and recorded it into a video to be taken back for reference when the Criminal Investigation Division held a hearing to investigate Maley. Afterwards, reporters visited forensic doctor Wang, who stated that Yu Shengxiao had three wounds in total. One was on the top of his head, which was struck with an iron object, causing the scalp to rupture and bleed profusely, but the skull was not broken. One was between the fourth finger and the middle finger on his left hand, with a laceration. The back of the head was also injured, with bloodstains, as if he had been holding his head and trying to resist. The fatal wound was that a bullet entered from the eighth rib behind the left side and exited from the third rib in front of the right side, slanting upwards and injuring the heart and lungs. This was the cause of Yu Shengxiao's death.

National Defense is in the Air, Aviation Belongs to the Public

Chen Qingyun, Minister of the Overseas Department, wrote an article "National Defense is in the Air, Aviation Belongs to the Public" to commemorate Air Force Day, stating that although aviation construction is complicated, it only requires the cooperation of the entire country to overcome difficulties and promote its success. Since Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the founding father of the country, pledged to promote "aviation to save the country," we have learned from several lessons that "without air defense, there is no national defense." During the War of Resistance, we launched a campaign to donate money and aircraft. Compatriots at home and abroad enthusiastically contributed. Unfortunately, due to poor objective conditions and a severe shortage of materials, the economic construction of aviation has failed to achieve its expected goals. After the victory, due to the disruption of the communists, the objective environment has not improved. However, national defense cannot be without an air force, and it still relies on compatriots across the country to grasp the link of aviation construction and work hard.

Shi Bangfan, an executive member of the Shanghai Branch of the Aviation Construction Association, also wrote an article "A Review and Prospect of the Work of the Shanghai Branch of the China Aviation Construction Association," elaborating on the association's business in great detail.

He accosted a young woman, Mrs. Zhang Chen, and asked her where she worked. She said that she was a domestic helper. Shen told her that the salary for a domestic helper was low.

Mrs. Zhang was so happy that she agreed. They arranged to meet again at the park at 10:00 AM the next morning.

### Unemployed Workers Have Difficulties with Subsistence: Attempting to Subsidize Their Return to Their Hometowns

[Our Dispatch] The Unemployed Workers Assistance Committee subsidizes unemployed workers in the rear area, and the monthly living expenses were previously allocated by the Executive Yuan on a monthly basis with relief flour. Since June of this year, the Executive Yuan has stopped providing it, so the committee has barely maintained it with the remaining relief flour, issuing one bag per person per month for their livelihood. However, the relief flour will also be exhausted by the end of this month. The committee, in view of the difficulty in providing living expenses, has decided that if unemployed workers staying at the center can afford to return to their hometowns, they can be subsidized to return. Each household will be issued 200,000 yuan in travel expenses, and three bags of large-mouth flour and one bag of small-mouth flour. However, because most workers' families are destitute and have no fields to cultivate after returning to their hometowns, they cannot make a living. Therefore, so far, only more than 100 people have been repatriated.

### Interview with One-Armed General Shi Bangfan: Four Generations of Military Service, Fathers and Grandfathers Martyred

In the atomic age, in three-dimensional warfare, the power of the air force is the most significant. On the second Air Force Day after the victory, the people of the country have placed the highest expectations on the evolution of the air force and the importance of the air force to national defense.

On a cool and breezy evening, I visited Colonel Shi Bangfan, the one-armed general. He recalled the past achievements of the air force and felt deeply moved. I took up my pen and listened to him talk vividly and touchingly.

Eternal Regret, Supreme Glory

General Shi is a veteran of the Air Force. During the January 28th Incident, he served as an instructor at Hangzhou Jianqiao. In order to deal with enemy planes, the fledgling air force sent him aloft in a single plane to fight the enemy planes. In an absolutely unfavorable situation, he shot down two enemy planes, and his left arm was hit by a bullet and disabled, leaving an eternal regret and supreme glory.

It is also pitiful to say that my country's air force was only initially established three months before the August 13th War of Resistance. Various different fighter planes were "show machines for birthday celebrations" donated by the public, with Shanghai citizens contributing the most. On this day ten years ago, he was the Chief of Staff of the Air Force Colonel in Nanjing. Flying Tiger General Chennault was the Senior Advisor, assisting Chief and Deputy Chief Zhou Zhirou and Mao Bangchu in planning to send bombers to attack the enemy fleet.

Remembering the Martyrs, Tears Fell

The enemy estimated that we only had Hawk-style bomber and fighter planes, which were not very fast. They sent Type 96 super-empty planes. On the evening of September 18, they broke into the capital city. He and Gao Zhihang had previously unloaded all the oil drums and bomb racks from the planes. Since the load was lightened, the speed increased greatly. As a result of the battle, the enemy planes were scattered and defeated.

What saddened him the most were several outstanding students, such as Gao Zhihang, who died in Zhoujiakou, Henan; Le Yiqin, Huang Zhengyu, Zhang Qi, and Yang Jihai also became martyrs one after another; Shen Chonghai was hit by a bullet in the night raid on Wusong and plunged into the enemy ship, destroying both the man and the machine, sacrificing heroically. When he said this, he took a sip of tea, remembering the deceased students, and tears fell.

A Family of Loyalty

During the eight years of the War of Resistance, air force talents emerged, and there was indeed considerable progress in technology and strategy, but the material conditions were insufficient, heavy industry was lacking, and scientific manufacturing equipment still needed to be improved. Technical talents still need to be trained more intensively. In short, the morale is strong, the materials are too poor, and a sound air force still requires us to work hard!

The general's grandfather, Shi Shengjun, was a commander in the Gengzi year. When the Eight-Power Allied Forces invaded, he died defending Dagu Port. His father, Shi Shaolin, was the chief of staff of a certain military detachment. He opposed Hong Xian and died in Lutan County. The National Government issued a decree to commend him. His son, Jiazhong, 17 years old, is studying at the Sichuan Guanxian Air Force Youth School. When he mentioned himself, he was ashamed and only sacrificed a left arm. He is willing to use what he has learned in his life to serve the Air Force, promote air construction, and work hard for the country! (Zhu Jiajun)

### Huge Check Bounces: Salt Merchant Deceived by Colleagues

[Our Newspaper Report] Wang Zhifu, who runs a salt business, lives at No. 3, Lane 229, Jiangsu Road. On December 20th of last year, Wu Chengjie, a colleague from the same industry, borrowed 2,000 US dollars from him, stating that he would repay 3,000 US dollars in principal and interest by the end of July. In May of this year, Wu again told Wang: He will have a US dollar draft for 3,200 US dollars at the end of July. He hopes to borrow another 200 US dollars, and in the future, he will use this draft as repayment. Wang then borrowed him another 2.4 million legal tender, equivalent to 200 US dollars at the official rate. By the end of July, Wu had no such US dollars. He borrowed a check from the Nanjing Road branch of the Bank of Communications from Lu Qinli, with a face value of 120 million legal tender. Wu gave this check to Wang. When Wang went to collect the money on August 4th, the check was returned due to insufficient funds. Wang then realized he had been deceived and filed a fraud complaint with the Jing'an Temple Road Police Sub-bureau. The case was transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation yesterday morning.

### Jindou Case Investigation Completed: Collegiate Panel to Hear Case Tomorrow; Director Liu Visits Commander Xuan to Discuss Trial Procedures

[Our Newspaper Report] The investigation into the Jin Du Theater police conflict blood case was not completed yesterday because ten detectives and witnesses had not reported to testify, causing the originally scheduled court hearing to be postponed to tomorrow. Yesterday, from 10:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., the Jin Du Theater inspector Zhang Yonggen, tea attendant Gu Yongquan, Mei Longbao, a worker at Fuxing Auto Repair Shop (near Jin Du) at No. 429, Zhongzheng Middle Road, Cao Guangzhi, a resident of Kader Road No. 1121 who happened to pass by the scene of the conflict, Cai Hefu, the young owner of Cai Wenji Western Clothing Store across from Jin Du Theater, Ji Tingfu, an employee of the Youth Department Store, Jia Rongzhen, a police officer from the Huangpu Police Sub-bureau, and Liu Junfu, the section chief of the Municipal Public Works Bureau, the "original instigator," were questioned. Except for Liu Junfu, who was instructed to be available at any time through the Public Works Bureau, the rest were dismissed. Section Chief Bao of the Prosecutor's Office stated that the investigation must be completed today, and a collegiate panel can be convened for a hearing tomorrow. In addition to Meng Qingtai and Xu Zengxiu, military judges from the Ministry of National Defense, Section Chief Bao, and Zeng Zhaoyi, director of the Military Law Department of the Garrison Headquarters, Liu Muzeng, the chief judge, also invited Commander Xuan to attend the court hearing, but it is said that Commander Yi has declined.

Focus of the Investigation

The reporter interviewed several citizens who were summoned to testify. According to reports, there were two main questions during the investigation: (1) Who fired the first shot? (2) Were the police completely unarmed? The former was difficult to determine because the conflict occurred at midnight, and the situation between the two sides gradually became tense. Bystanders all fled first, but they heard gunshots and could not identify who fired them. For the latter, the witnesses truthfully answered what they had witnessed.

Director Liu Muzeng visited Commander Xuan yesterday morning to discuss trial procedures and visited Fang Zhi, the director of the Municipal Party Headquarters, in the afternoon. Director Fang expressed his hope that the case would be concluded as soon as possible and that future emotional ties between the military police work could be strengthened. The Municipal Party Headquarters, the Council, and other agencies are willing to assist in promoting this spirit of cooperation. Director Liu also scheduled to survey the Jin Du Theater this afternoon.

[Another Report] The witnesses to be questioned today include Zhang Nianfa, the driver of the truck carrying winter melons that passed by Jin Du Theater before the blood case occurred, and Liang Ruyuan, police officer No. 6913 of the New Urban Sub-bureau, and seven or eight others.

### Promoting the Jianqiao Spirit to Welcome the Eighth Air Force Day

[Our Newspaper Hangzhou, 12th] The Air Force Headquarters, with the Eighth Air Force Day approaching, has specially written an article on the historical program of "August 14th." The main purpose is to awaken the people of the country to work hard to suppress the rebellion and promote the fighting spirit of the Air Force. The main points are recorded as follows: "The Chinese Air Force has grown up in extremely difficult and arduous conditions. The Chinese Air Force will always be victorious. This victory began with the first great air battle in the skies of Jianqiao on "August 14th" in the 26th year of the Republic. Due to the glorious victory of the "August 14th" air battle, there were later two, three, and countless great air victories. The government authorities, in order to commemorate and promote this "August 14th" spirit, specifically designated August 14th as Chinese Air Force Day. Every year on this day, never forget. This year is the eighth "August 14th." Looking forward to the future of the country and recalling the deeds of the martyrs, one cannot help but feel moved.

China has been engaged in the anti-aggression war for eight years. Its purpose is to seek the independence and autonomy of the country and the nation. Relying on the concerted efforts of the military and civilians across the country and the spirit of the martyrs' sacrifice for justice, the War of Resistance finally achieved the final victory, and the country and the nation also gained a good opportunity for rehabilitation and construction. Unexpectedly, after the victory, the Communist bandits rioted everywhere, destroying transportation, destroying production institutions, and destroying the peace, unity, and revival of the country. Thinking silently about the hardships of the martyrs in starting their careers and their heroic sacrifices, especially our Air Force warriors have done their utmost in this sacred war of national liberation, giving their all until their death. Unexpectedly, the final victory that was exchanged for blood and flesh was trampled on by the Communist bandits to such an extreme. This is intolerable. In order not to be ashamed of our ancestors and not to let down the martyrs, we should all rise up and work hard to suppress the rebellious bandits, promote the Jianqiao spirit, commemorate "August 14th" with action, and praise "August 14th" with hard work." (Liangcai)

### Iron Troops, New Vitality: The 74th Division's Reorganization and Replenishment Work is Advancing Rapidly

[Special Correspondent Ding Kuanghua, Nanjing, 11th] The Battle of Menglianggu was loyal, brave, and heroic, shaking China and foreign countries. It represented the soul of Chinese soldiers and the revolutionary spirit of China. Division Commander Zhang Lingfu and the collective suicide of his subordinates represented a spirit of sacrifice. How great it was.

Division Commander Qiu Weida (Sent by Special Correspondent Ding Kuanghua)

Visiting Division Commander Qiu in Chuxian

The military campaign to suppress bandits has undergone a major turning point due to the Battle of Menglianggu. In the experience of reviewing the battle results, we have strictly enforced discipline and changed our strategy. Today, central Shandong is being revealed, western Shandong is reporting victories, the "People's Liberation Army" is being annihilated, and Liu Bocheng's main force is being surrounded... These are all the consequences of the heroic sacrifice of the 74th Division. Although the bandit army destroyed the tangible essence of the Reorganized 74th Division, it has not in the slightest deprived my 74th Division of its intangible spirit of fearlessness. In the Langya Mountains and on Motian Ridge, countless soldiers are singing the roar of "We are Iron Troops" and forming a capable Chen Rong.

Reinvigorating the army to sweep the Central Plains, that is something we can predict.

The reporter made a special trip from Nanjing to Chuxian to visit General Qiu. On this day, he happened to be going to Lai'an for inspection. After waiting for an hour, he returned. As soon as he got out of the car, he shook the reporter's hand tightly. After sitting down in the office, I stared at Division Commander Qiu from time to time and then asked, "Division Commander Qiu, what are your thoughts on the Battle of Menglianggu of the 74th Division?" This question touched Division Commander Qiu's heart. He said to the reporter very sadly: "I share life and death with the 74th Division. Now that most of my superiors, colleagues, and subordinates have sacrificed, it really makes me want to cry. Today, I am shouldering the unfinished mission of the martyrs. I deeply feel apprehensive, but I believe that I have the perseverance, I have the determination, and I will definitely turn this vitality into iron troops to complete the unfinished will of the martyrs!"

"How is Division Commander Qiu handling the aftermath?"

"After the Battle of Menglianggu ended, I rushed to Linyi.

To handle the aftermath, collect the loyal remains, accommodate the escaped officers and soldiers, and rescue the accompanying family members. After moving to Dangshan, we handled the remains of the fallen soldiers, sent condolences, and personally went to various hospitals to comfort the wounded soldiers. The remains of senior generals have been found and coffined, and they have been transported back to their hometowns for burial or temporarily placed in selected locations. In order to commemorate the loyal souls, it has been decided to hold a memorial service on August 13th to comfort the loyal souls!"

"Is your division reorganized yet?"

"After we moved to Dangshan, the Ministry of National Defense ordered me to urgently recruit 10,000 new soldiers from the various division areas and Suqian regiment area in southern Henan, central Anhui, and southern Anhui to replenish the vacancies so that this glorious bandit suppression force could be restored as soon as possible. Therefore, I immediately dispatched cadres to form several

Recruitment teams to receive them separately. In less than two months, we completed the convergence of these cells. At this time, the officers and soldiers of this unit who recovered from their injuries also returned to the hospital. The new vitality and the old essence and blood have formed this new team. I believe that we can fight soon and we will definitely be able to wash away the scars of Menglianggu!" Division Commander Qiu told the reporter with such confidence and joy.

The reporter asked Division Commander Qiu about the training situation. Division Commander Qiu said that Langya Mountain is an excellent place, so I used it to train cadres. I

Personally train the first, second, and third officer teams and the seventh army team. In addition, there are also medical personnel training classes, communications personnel training classes, intelligence personnel training classes, and radio personnel training classes to meet the needs. Now this unit has completed the reorganization and replenishment work of × regiment, and after replenishing × regiment, it can achieve its original establishment. The reporter, in order to catch the "Victory" night train, could not talk to Chief of Staff Li for a long time, so he said goodbye to Division Commander Qiu. Division Commander Qiu said: "We will see you again in the Central Plains!" In the reporter's eardrums, this is a magnificent roar!

General Qiu Weida, the new division commander of the 74th Division, is a soldier with the genius of strategizing. He graduated from the Army University and has a thorough understanding of strategy and tactics. He has always assisted General Wang Yaowu in military affairs. In the unprecedented victory of the "Glorious Army" in western Hunan, he was the chief of staff of the Fourth Front Army at that time, and therefore, he was especially valued by Wang Yaowu. When accepting the surrender of the Beijing-Shanghai area, he was the commander of the 51st Division. After the reorganization of the National Army, he was promoted to deputy division commander of the Reorganized 74th Division. At this time, the situation in Shandong was tense, and Commander Wang Yaowu temporarily pulled him out to serve as the garrison commander of the Zibo area, the heart of Shandong. Unfortunately, the battle situation reversed, and Zibo was evacuated. In that emergency situation, he was able to transport dozens of locomotives and all the materials to Jinan. This time, he succeeded the division commander as deputy division commander, which is really the most appropriate choice. He is now working hard day and night to reorganize and train the troops in order to set off to suppress the bandits as soon as possible and avenge the martyrs who sacrificed in Menglianggu.

In the evening, Zhu attended a banquet hosted by Wu Shaoshu, Executive Secretary of the Youth Corps, where they discussed the issue of merging the Party and the State. When reporters visited, they were received by He Shijun, Director of the General Affairs Department of the Ministry of Education, who stated that Zhu's trip to the Northeast would be limited to Shenyang and would serve as the first inspection since the victory. He added that educational problems in the Northeast, especially in the areas of Siping that were affected by the war, are particularly serious and require on-site inspection to facilitate handling and improvement. After arriving in Peiping, Zhu will stay for several days to inspect various universities and general educational institutions in Peiping. Regarding the demands of students in Peiping's universities for continued public funding and improved teacher compensation, these could not be met due to an order from the Executive Yuan.

### Ministry of Finance Approves Eight Major Issues Regarding US Dollar Bond Mortgage Loans

Regarding US dollar government bonds and treasury bills, the Ministry of Finance has stipulated that they can be freely mortgaged, with the discount temporarily set at 70% of the face value. Afterwards, national banks and bureaus raised relevant questions and requested instructions from the Four Joint Offices. There are eight points: (1) How to regulate the object, use, term, and interest rate of mortgage loans? (2) Should US dollar government bonds be mortgaged for national currency at a ratio of 12,000 per unit? (3) Should the bonds used for mortgage be limited to those sold by the banks and bureaus themselves? (4) If US dollar bondholders apply to the banks and bureaus for mortgage loans in the name of private individuals or organizations, can they be accepted? (5) If bank and bureau employees purchase bonds, can they be allowed to mortgage them with their respective banks and bureaus for loans in case of urgent need? (6) If the banks and bureaus re-mortgage the US dollar bonds they have received with the national bank, can this be done? (7) If the subscription receipts issued by the banks and bureaus cannot be exchanged for formal bonds for the time being, can these subscription receipts be mortgaged for loans in the same way? (8) According to regulations, various loans must first be reviewed to determine whether the use of the loan is truly legitimate before being granted. If an application for a loan is made using these bonds as collateral, should the mortgage be accepted at any time? Regarding the above points, the Four Joint Offices have transferred them to the Ministry of Finance, which has approved the following separately: (1) Banks that undertake loans secured by US dollar government bonds and treasury bills should handle the object, use, term, interest rate, etc., in accordance with the regulations for loans. (2) When US dollar government bonds are used as collateral for loans, they should be calculated at 70% of the face value according to the Central Bank's exchange rate, and the loan should be made in national currency. (3) The bonds used as collateral for loans are not limited to those sold by the banks and bureaus themselves. (4) If US dollar bondholders apply to the banks and bureaus for mortgage loans, the banks and bureaus can handle them in accordance with the general loan regulations and may decide whether to accept them based on their own position. (5) Bank and bureau employees who purchase bonds are not allowed to apply to their respective banks and bureaus for mortgage loans in accordance with the general loan regulations. (6) Regarding the re-mortgage of the bonds received by the banks and bureaus with the national bank, the Ministry of Finance has previously issued a telegraphic circular No. 24626, requesting the Central Bank to consider the circumstances of the banks and money shops and, when necessary, to refer to the provisional discount for lending and re-mortgaging to facilitate turnover and benefit sales. (7) The subscription receipts issued by the banks and bureaus are only certificates for exchanging for formal bonds and should not be used as collateral for loans. However, in order to facilitate financing for bond purchasers, it is permissible for the banks and bureaus to jointly handle them. (8) The application for a loan by US dollar government bonds and treasury bill holders, using these bonds as collateral, is the same as item 4.

Nos. 160, 153, 31, 232, 76, and 186 successively closed out positions. The gang on the trading floor also had a strong intention to sell. Di Yong Yarn once fell back within the 200 yuan mark.

### Floating Bulls Frequently Sell Off; Cotton Yarn and Cloth Start Strong but End Weak; Leading Fine Cloth Once Called Up to 400,000 Yuan

Yesterday, the cotton yarn market saw no change in the opening yarn price of the Textile Construction Company. 20-count yarn was sold in large quantities for 9.5 million. Trading opened higher on the floor, then prices fell back due to floating bulls selling off. Actual sales remained sluggish.

The final price of 42-count Blue Phoenix yarn was 16.05 million yuan, and 32-count was 13.3 million yuan, a step increase of 300,000 to 500,000 yuan compared to the previous day. 20-count Special Double Horse, however, fell by 100,000 yuan to 11 million yuan. Light Double Horse was 9.7 million yuan, squeezed up by 100,000 yuan. Other counts of coarse and fine yarn rose by 100,000 to 250,000 yuan. However, 20-count Tian Nvren, Zhong Shuang Earth, and 10-count Jinbao Xing, etc., remained sluggish.

Yesterday, the cotton cloth market initially saw some purchases from Taiwan and Changsha merchants. Also, with the negotiated price of cotton yarn not reduced, market sentiment turned firmer, and the market trend was boosted once. However, by the noon close, actual sales on the street were stagnant, and there were also high-level sell-offs, so the market trend weakened again.

The final price of 12-pound leading fine cloth was 400,500 yuan, an increase of 22,000 yuan from the previous day. Wufu, Blue Chicken, Caiqiu, Yanghe, and extra-fine cloths also rose by 22,000 to 30,000 yuan. Other fine twills, jeans, and bleached cloth, colored cloth, and Shilin cloth also rebounded by 5,000 to 30,000 yuan. However, coarse cloth prices continued to fall by 10,000 yuan.

[Our Report] The China Textile Construction Company sold yarn as usual yesterday, totaling 313 pieces. The manufacturers' purchase orders totaled 104.

### Current Cotton Market Turns Stable

Yesterday, the spot cotton market's sentiment improved due to the rebound in cotton yarn prices, and the trend has stabilized. Trading was also slightly more active than the previous day. Yarn factories frequently showed interest, and traders also engaged in transactions with each other. However, with prices having fallen, merchants have already suffered significant losses, so those with ample funds are still reluctant to sell. Prices for delivery to factories were: Lingbao 20.65 million, Shashi 19.5 million. Prices for warehouse delivery were: Lingbao 20 million, 20.2 million, and on credit: 20.5 million, 20.65 million, Shashi 19 million, 19.2 million, and Huoji 15 million.

### China Trust Bureau to Purchase New Tea Based on Cost Calculation

The Central Trust Bureau is currently preparing to purchase new tea for the 36th year (of the Republic), with the purchasing principle determined to be based on cost calculation. The purchase of old tea from the 35th year has already begun, with purchase prices based on overseas prices. Qimen tea is set at 720,000 per case. Overseas prices are lower than domestic prices, so the purchase price is also lower. Now, the Central Trust Bureau, to alleviate the difficulties of merchants, will have the Tea Association submit a cost calculation report for the 36th year's new tea. After review and investigation by the bureau, a purchase price will be set with the addition of a legitimate profit, so the purchase price of new tea will be much higher than in the past. This year's tea production is greater than last year's. According to tea merchants, if the Central Trust Bureau sets a higher purchase price, they can profit, and production may further increase. Currently, tea destined for Shanghai can be mortgaged to the Farmers Bank. As of yesterday, the Farmers Bank had accepted mortgages on over 5,000 cases of tea.

It is also learned that the old tea of the 35th year has now been entirely purchased by the French company Yongxing, so the Central Trust Bureau has purchased very little.

Another report: Yesterday, the domestic tea market remained active but lacked overall movement, resulting in mediocre trading. Although sellers tried to raise prices, it was difficult to advance. By the close of the market, the trend was firm. As for export tea, due to scarce imports and exports, the entire day was quiet, generally similar to the previous day.

They pointed out that the current fuel rationing is due to the insufficient national coal production to meet the national consumption. In order to regulate supply and demand, the authorities make overall arrangements for transportation and distribution based on the depth of the relationship between various industries and the national economy and people's livelihood, and the urgency of needs, so as to minimize the severity of the coal shortage. Therefore, it seems impossible to abolish rationing before the national coal production situation returns to normal. The recent rumors of abolition may be due to the authorities' plan to organize order-based loans, which also included coal, leading to the misunderstanding that coal will resume free sales.

Another report: In order to enrich the source of coal supply, the Fuel Control Committee had promulgated the "Measures for Allowing Manufacturers to Purchase and Transport Coal on Their Own." However, the provisions in that article stipulated that each manufacturer could only purchase and transport 100 tons per month. Now, because that amount is too small and does not meet actual needs, the committee has submitted a request to the Ministry of Economic Affairs to cancel the above restriction order. In the future, there will be no restrictions on the amount of coal purchased by coal merchants.

### Rice Prices Continue Downward

Yesterday, a total of more than 4,400 shi of rice arrived in the North and South markets, but digestion was slow, and the market continued its downward trend. Japonica rice fell by 30,000 to 50,000 per step, and indica rice also fell by 60,000 to 70,000. White silver dollars were raised for further selling. New japonica rice temporarily lacked change.

Flour prices saw mixed ups and downs. Foreign flour sales were surprisingly strong, exceptionally brisk, and rose sharply by 10,000. Mill flour was mediocre, and miscellaneous brands of flour rebounded by a small 1,000. Bran sales in rural areas were very sluggish, initially firm but later weakening, with the situation looking soft, slightly weakening by 300 to 500. Soybean cake trading was normal. Taiwan had some interest, but rural villages were scarce, continuing to fall by 1,000 to 2,000. The source of soybeans was continuous, but interest was lukewarm, declining daily. New and old soybeans continued to plummet by 50,000 to 60,000 to 10,000.

Mung beans gradually declined, falling another 10,000. Adzuki beans settled. Broad beans saw slightly weak interest from customers and local traders, turning down by 30,000 to 50,000. Corn in the North Ocean was unchanged, falling by 10,000 per step. Kernel grains also fell wildly by 10,000. Sesame still lacked luster. Raw kernels from South China were discontinued. Local sales were sparse and sluggish, plummeting by varying amounts of 2 million, 3 million, or 4 million.

The oil market lacked transactions from Guangdong merchants, and shop interest was extremely low. Customers were hesitant to move forward, and the market continued to decline. Raw oil was clearly set but secretly stagnant, refined oil softened, soybean oil plummeted by 2 million to 3 million, and rapeseed oil also fell by 2 million to 3 million. Sesame oil also fell by 10,000 to 20,000.

Hunan Rice Prices Rise

[Our Report from Hengyang, 12th] With the opening of Hunan grain exports, grain prices have risen. Top-grade rice is now 150,000 per dan, setting a new high record for Hunan grain this year.

Siamese Rice Arrives in Shanghai

The 18,000 tons of rice ordered by the Central Trust Bureau from Siam has now had 2,000 tons shipped to Shanghai, with the remainder continuously en route. All of it is expected to arrive by the end of this month. The bureau has also recently ordered a batch of foreign rice from American merchants, in a very large quantity. It will start shipping to Shanghai once both parties have signed the contract.

### White Coal Scarce and Prices Firm

The coal market had previously seen transactions stall invisibly due to the truck drivers and coolies striking, but this has not been resolved for many days. Yesterday, work was resumed, and buying and selling moved accordingly. Due to handling costs, the arrival of white coal was not much. Although sales were in a dull month, the market was still firm. The transshipment price for Yuanhua Coal's chips at the ship's side for this month has been raised to 800,000. Coke had more stock, and prices were still stable. Bituminous coal plant sales were sluggish, and the market was weaker. The transshipment price of Chenxi Tong coal at the ship's side has entered the 1.2 million mark.

### Artificial Silk Allocation Dispute: Silk Weaving Industry Holds Consecutive Meetings Yesterday, Decides to Send 15 Representatives to Beijing to Petition

The artificial silk allocation dispute between the silk weaving industry and the China Trust Bureau has now reached a deadlock. The industry association dispatched representatives Cai Xintao, Liu Qingyi, and others to visit Mayor Wu at 5:00 PM yesterday to report on the recent situation of the industry and inquire about the mayor's mediation results. According to the association, they have decided to send 15 representatives to Beijing tonight to petition the central authorities to order the China Trust Bureau to reduce the allocation price of artificial silk. The industry association also continued to hold a small group meeting at 3:00 PM yesterday to discuss matters related to the petition to Beijing.

Black Market Prices Rise

Because the China Trust Bureau will not temporarily reduce the allocation price of artificial silk, the black market has again announced price increases. However, silk fabric manufacturers still lack interest and have no transactions, otherwise, prices may soar even higher. Yesterday, Gaoshan Youguang, No. 120, quoted 24.56 million in the morning and 4.8 million in the afternoon. Dongyang quoted 5 million. Traders also remained on the sidelines, with no transactions.

Mill Spun Still Shows No Improvement

Various grades of 5-dan yarns all lacked transactions. More than ten dan lots of high-grade and medium-grade yarns were offered in the market yesterday. The former was priced at 27.5 million to 8 million, and the latter was priced at 26.5 million to 7 million, all with five- or six-day futures. The opening price for low-grade Qianjing goods was 15 million, 500,000 lower than the previous day. Prices for 28-point goods also weakened slightly. Anhui small factory silk was priced at 20 million.

Major Dealers Lift Silk Fabrics

Yesterday, silk fabrics saw major dealers lifting real silk quilt covers, 100,000 higher than the previous day. Huaqiang goods were traded at 10.05 million and 60,000 after the market opened. Due to multiple floating profits, some were sold, with the lowest price dropping to 9.98 million, but it then recovered. The final spot price was 10.05 million, and the price for the next day was 100,000. Dacheng goods rose 100,000 more than Huaqiang. Dacheng checkered crepe was offered at 34,000, and someone wanted 3,700, but the deal did not go through. There were very few Meiya quilt cover orders on the market. There were no transactions or quotations yesterday.

### Purchase of Arrived Foreign Cotton Ends on August 15th

[Our Report] According to the China Trust Bureau, the application for the purchase of foreign cotton that has arrived will end on August 15th and will not be extended at that time. Regarding the purchase of this batch of foreign cotton, after review by the small group meeting on August 9th, the first batch of 25,000 bales, valued at over US$4.4 million, has been contracted for 20,000 bales, except for 5,000 bales, which require further instructions before ordering. As for the second batch of approximately 10,000 bales, it is still under review.

### Import Licenses: 3,186 Pieces Approved in July

### Order-Based Loan Measures: Seeking Opinions from the Four Joint Offices

[Our Report] The outline of the draft measures for order-based loans for daily necessities planned by the Four Joint Offices was published in this newspaper yesterday. It is learned that the authorities believe that order-based loans can be effective in securing materials, but whether to order all of the production volume of each industry is still under consideration. If it is implemented across the board, the following points must be considered: (1) a large outflow of funds, (2) stimulation of raw material prices, (3) impact on finished product costs, (4) causing the original funds of the industry to escape. If it is not a full-scale ordering, in order to take into account the production of each industry and enrich the materials, it seems appropriate to refer to the original loan methods for assistance. The Four Joint Offices are now soliciting opinions from the relevant competent authorities on the order-based loan measures. The content of the solicitation of opinions includes: ordering area, ordering period, product standards, delivery conditions, loan conditions, full ordering or partial ordering, the total amount of order-based loans required for each product, etc., so that after summarizing the opinions, a careful study will be made, and detailed rules for the implementation of the order-based loan measures will be formulated.

### Reader Consultation Legal Interpretation 18-Year-Old Girl of Marriageable Age Stepmother Makes the Decision to Arrange a Marriage Dispute Over a Sale-Type Marriage

Dear Editor: My friend, Miss A, is a woman. At the age of 18, her stepmother made the decision, through a matchmaker, to arrange a marriage with Mr. B, who lives in the same house. At that time, Miss A's consent was not obtained. Now, Miss A has another suitor, Mr. C, and intends to cancel the original marriage arrangement. There are several legal questions regarding this matter, please provide answers: (1) Is the marriage arrangement made by Miss A's stepmother on her behalf when she was a minor valid? Miss A is currently under the legal age, can she publish a notice in the newspaper to deny this marriage arrangement? (2) If Mr. B uses illegal means to threaten Mr. C and Miss A, how should they respond? (3) If Mr. B agrees to terminate the arrangement, how should they respond? (4) If Miss A proposes to terminate the arrangement, does she have to compensate the other party for losses, and how should the engagement gifts be returned? (5) Can Miss A disregard Mr. B's interference and get engaged to Mr. C directly? Reader Zhang Huaguo.

[This Column's Answer] (1) According to Article 972 of the Civil Code, marriage arrangements should be made by the man and woman themselves, otherwise they are invalid. Miss A's stepmother made the marriage arrangement on her behalf without obtaining her consent, so this marriage arrangement is invalid and there is no need to publish a notice to deny it. (2) If Mr. B uses illegal means to threaten Miss A and Mr. C, if there is concrete evidence, he can be prosecuted for the crime of intimidation according to Article 346 of the Criminal Code. (3) Since this marriage arrangement is invalid, Mr. B has no right to interfere. (4) There is no need to compensate for losses. The engagement gifts should be returned by Miss A's stepmother. (5) If Miss A has reached adulthood, she can make a marriage arrangement with Mr. C, and Mr. B cannot interfere.

### On Telecommunications Construction in the Economic Reform Plan

— Tao Yong

The National Economic Committee's reviewed and amended economic reform plan was discussed and passed by the State Council on August 1st, and telecommunications is also mentioned. According to Articles 5, 6, and 7 of Section IV of Item B in the reform plan, "Telegraphs are operated by the central government. Unpaid radio stations specifically needed by aviation and shipping in the sea and air can be set up independently under the management of the central government." "Long-distance telephone trunk lines and inter-provincial lines are constructed by the central government. Branch lines within each province are laid by the province, but they must not be parallel to the trunk lines or inter-provincial lines. County and township branch lines are laid by the township." "City telephones, except for those in municipalities directly under the Executive Yuan and provincial municipalities, which are handled by the central government or publicly operated, the remaining counties are encouraged to be operated by the people, and regulations are stipulated to allow them to connect with long-distance telephones." In other words, telegraph and telephone services that are national or inter-provincial in nature are handled by the central government, and long-distance telephones within the scope of provinces and counties are constructed by local governments. County and township telephones and some special business radio stations and broadcasting stations are allowed to be operated by private enterprises under government management.

Telecommunications is a national and even international transportation construction that is closely related to the entire national defense, politics, economy, and people's livelihood, and should be operated by the state. However, China has a vast territory, and the scope of telecommunications is unusually broad, including telegraphs, long-distance telephones, city telephones, broadcasting stations, navigation and aviation communication, etc. If each and every one of them is operated by the state, not only will the strength be insufficient, but the time required will be difficult to estimate. Therefore, dividing them into state-run, publicly-run, and privately-run according to their nature and scope, so as to achieve the effect of division of labor and cooperation, is a wise move. However, telecommunications is different from other industries and commerce. Except for a few businesses, such as broadcasting stations, which can be profitable, most of them are unprofitable. Take telephones as an example. According to pre-war statistics, the equipment cost per user, including telephone lines, in-house machines, and bureau buildings, is about US$80, while telephone revenue cannot be too heavy because it is a public utility. In addition to expenses, it can only pay the interest on loans. There is no place for the amortization of all loans and the depreciation of costs. Therefore, private operations are nominal but not real, and it is very difficult to seek universal development. Even publicly-run long-distance telephones only focus on politics and public security, and are not designed to facilitate the public. This has lost the meaning of telecommunications as a public utility. Therefore, if only the authority is separated and the government does not provide assistance and subsidies, it may still be difficult for publicly-run and privately-run telecommunications to develop. Secondly, most people in the interior of our country still do not know the use and benefits of telecommunications. Therefore, instilling telecommunications knowledge into the public is also an important plan for seeking the development of telecommunications. Finally, in order to reduce costs, the government should encourage the manufacture of telecommunications machinery so that the general public can enjoy it. Therefore, we hope that the government will pay attention to the above-mentioned three points of assistance, education, and manufacturing at the same time, so that state-run, publicly-run, and privately-run can develop in a balanced manner. In this way, China's telecommunications construction will have a brilliant future.

Caption for the photo: In order to facilitate users' inquiries and questions, the Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau has set up public service counters at each demonstration business office. The scope of work includes (1) distributing telegram forms (2) writing telegrams on behalf of customers (3) managing public telephones in business offices (4) paying attention to the cleanliness and order outside the counters in business offices (5) instructing senders to use express, express, facsimile, and night letter telegrams and informing them of various telegram fees and procedures (6) reporting on the progress of express telegrams (7) managing lost property for senders to claim (8) instructing senders on how to simplify telegram procedures (9) calculating fees and checking for customers when there are calculation errors (10) others. The above picture shows the public service counter at the Fuzhou Road main business office.

### General Overview of This Bureau's Operations (Middle)

— Li Tong

B. Telephone Section

1. Long-Distance Telephone

A. Wired

There are fifty-seven direct wired long-distance telephone circuits, reaching Nanjing, Zhenjiang, Wuxi, Wu County, Hangzhou, Yin County, Wujin, Changshu, Hankou, Xuzhou, Wuhu, Taicang, Jiading, Jiaxing, Chuansha, Kunshan, Minhang, Baoshan, Songjiang, Qingpu, and twenty other locations. In addition, there are three wireless ultra-shortwave (Radio Link) circuits to Nanjing, three to Ying County, and over a hundred other relayed calling locations. Among these, calls between Shanghai and Nanjing are the busiest, hence fifteen pairs of circuits are allocated. Other major commercial ports along the Shanghai-Nanjing-Hangzhou line include seven circuits to Wu County, five to Wuxi, and nine to Hangzhou.

B. Wireless

There are two wireless telephone circuit positions, connecting to Chongqing, Taipei, Peiping, Qingdao, Guangzhou, Jinan, and other locations.  Tianjin, Xi'an, Lanzhou, and Shenyang are planned for opening soon. Wireless circuits are limited by call duration and are sometimes affected by atmospheric interference, resulting in lower communication efficiency compared to wired lines.

C. Long-Distance Call Services

"Special Express" Telegram: Introduced at the end of last year. Users can connect within ten minutes of registration. Available locations are Nanjing, Zhenjiang, Wuxi, Wu County, Hangzhou, Jiaxing, Yin County, and seven other locations.

Message Relay Service: This bureau, recognizing the current shortage of lines, circuit congestion, and the frequent long waits for users after registration, which can cause delays in urgent matters, and considering the inconvenience for passengers at transportation hubs who need to communicate with other locations, has introduced a message relay service. Users only need to fill out the message relay registration form at the bureau's business office, providing the recipient's name, phone number, and the message to be delivered, or call 46277 or 46278 to the bureau's message relay registration desk, and the message will be reliably and quickly delivered to the recipient within two hours, providing convenience and suitability.

Urgent Call: An urgent call is second to a "special express" call, connecting within one hour of registration. During busy times, the maximum call limit is three attempts.

Ordinary Call: An ordinary call is second to an urgent call, connecting within two hours of registration.

Nighttime Discounted Calls: Due to the current shortage of lines, daytime circuits are more congested. Users with non-time-sensitive calls can call after 11 PM, when circuits are more open, and connection is faster. The price is discounted by 30% compared to daytime rates. Nighttime calling hours are from 11 PM to 7 AM the next morning.

2. Local Telephone

Due to pre-war foreign concessions in Shanghai, the American-owned Shanghai Telephone Company was established in the former concession areas, with a contract signed with the Chinese government. Although the concessions were recovered after the victory, the foreign enterprise continued to exist. The scope of this bureau only covers Zhabei, Hongkou, Nanshi, the city center, and the suburban areas of Pudong, Longhua, Zhenru, Wusong, etc., i.e., the "102" telephone. The total equipment capacity is approximately 6,000 numbers. Due to the eight-year war of resistance, pre-war equipment was almost completely destroyed by the enemy and puppet regimes. After the takeover, this bureau actively organized restoration, but due to a lack of equipment, expansion is difficult. A brief overview of the local telephone situation within the scope of this bureau is listed below:

(1) "02-60000 - 62599" are automatic telephones (Hongkou District)

(2) "02-70000 - 71999" are automatic telephones (Only 200 numbers are usable, the rest have not been repaired) (Nanshi District)

(3) "02-50000 - 50499" are automatic telephones (City Center District)

(4) "64000 - 64049" are magneto telephones (Zhenru District)

(5) "65000 - 65049" are magneto telephones (Wusong District)

(6) "66000 - 66059" are common battery telephones (Fuxing District)

(7) "74000 - 74119" are common battery telephones (Pudong District)

(8) "75000 - 75120" are common battery telephones (Longhua District)

(Business Section to be continued)

### Telephone Flowers

A new telegram agency has been established inside the Chinese National Travel Service on Wukang Road (i.e., Kaishen Road) to facilitate telegrams for the people in the western district.

The Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau employees have already begun to organize a labor union, guided by the bureau chief Yu Bingjian, as designated by the Ministry of Transportation. It is said that the inaugural meeting will be held soon.

The domestic telegram registration office at the Fuzhou Road headquarters has been moved to the branch office at Tianjin Road and Changzhi Road.

### The Process of Telegram Transmission

The process from the time a sender hands a telegram to the business office of the sending bureau until the receiver receives it is probably not noticed by most people. Now, let's introduce the handling procedures for telegrams to the readers. Regarding the acceptance procedures at the business office, anyone who has sent a telegram will surely know. The telegram is first sent from the business office to the telegram room. After receiving it, the telegram room's dispatcher immediately assigns a route according to the destination, fills it in, gives it to the numbering clerk to add a machine-generated serial number, and sends it to the machine for encoding and transmission. After the receiving bureau receives it, it first gives it to the dispatcher to sort and check according to the destination, and there are the following two situations:

(1) If it is a telegram destined for that bureau, it is sent to the receiving telegram numbering clerk, who assigns a receiving telegram serial number, then gives it to the envelope preparation clerk to write the receiver's name and address on the envelope, with one copy sealed inside for internal use, and given to the delivery person to deliver to the receiver's address by district. The remaining copy is given to the reviewer to check for errors or misdelivery. After this procedure, this telegram is considered completed. Then, the collator organizes the serial numbers, binds them into a book, and sends them to the telegram archive room for filing, for reference when necessary.

(2) If it is a relayed telegram, for example, a telegram from this bureau to Yichang, because there is no direct circuit, it must be relayed through the Hankou bureau. After the intermediate bureau's machine receives it, it forwards it according to the destination. When the receiving bureau receives it, it also hands it over for delivery according to the receiving telegram handling procedures described above.

To be cautious, the telecommunications bureau requires all outgoing, incoming, and relayed telegrams to be reviewed by the checker after ten transmissions. If there are any errors, they are immediately corrected to remedy them. Also, to be speedy, time limits are set for the handling of all types of telegrams, and they should not be exceeded unless there are special reasons, to show thoughtful service. (Huang Yan)

### Talking Points on Telecommunications Knowledge (2)

— Zhang Jia'an

Lecture 2: First, Look at the Header

One of my younger brothers often omits the date when writing letters. People who receive his letters are often confused, not knowing when the letter was actually written. I have asked him to correct this more than once. In fact, my brother is also someone who works in the telegram industry. Perhaps he realizes that adding a date (usually using a date code or a date and time code) in a telegram text would cost one or two extra word fees. Therefore, subconsciously, he also omits the date when writing letters!

In fact, a shrewd recipient, even if the sender does not specify the date on the envelope or in the letter, can still see the date and time the sending bureau received the letter from the postmark stamped on the envelope by the post office. Similarly, a shrewd telegram recipient can also save on telegraph fees by knowing the sending date, time, and other records beneficial to the sender and receiver from the telegram header. If both the sender and receiver of a telegram understand how to read the telegram header, then not only can the sender and receiver use the facts to test the credibility of the telecommunications bureau's advertising, but also, because the telegram header already contains a faithful record of the sending date and time, there is no need to add a date code or a date and time code after the telegram text, saving at least one or two words of telegram fees per telegram.

The telegram header is at the top of the telegram, in the following format:

Among the various records in the telegram header, apart from the serial number, original number, and remarks, which are not of much direct relevance to the sender and receiver, the remaining five items, such as the telegram type, sending bureau name, number of words, sending date, and sending time, are necessary for the sender and receiver to understand for their own benefit. Because, from these records, you can see what type of telegram this is, you can check whether any words or sentences in the telegram have been missed by the telecommunications bureau during transmission, and you can also verify whether your telegram sending and receiving is indeed extremely fast.

Usually, domestic telegrams between private individuals generally fall into the following five categories:

(1) Special Express Telegram (Telegram Type is LTN) (2) Urgent Telegram (Telegram Type is D)

(3) Ordinary Telegram (Telegram Type is P) (4) Night Letter Telegram (Telegram Type is NLT)

(5) Social Telegram (Telegram Type is SLT) (To be continued)
