### Councilor Raises Improvement Suggestions on Military and National Defense Work

[Our Nanjing Office, 29th] At a time when the national border defenses are not yet consolidated, and local order is still in turmoil, some councilors have put forward important suggestions for improving military and national defense work. According to a councilor who participated in the first review committee on the 29th, the general consensus focuses on the following seven points: (1) The military reorganization policy should be changed to meet current needs. (2) Efforts should be made to improve the weaknesses of the army. (3) Enrich local military forces and strive for coordination with military administration. (4) Various forms of compensation should be handled effectively. (5) The more than 250,000 retired officers should be properly resettled as soon as possible. (6) Military academy students should be recruited as much as possible. (7) Efforts should be made to recover Harbin quickly. Regarding the first point, he said: They generally advocate that the military reorganization policy should be to strive for the realization of elite troops, enrich their quality, strengthen existing troops, improve quality, and strengthen training, and to coordinate military strength with spiritual, political, and material mobilization in order to achieve the task. There should be no regional factionalism in the selection of reorganization. Regarding improving weaknesses, it is generally advocated to increase military spending, improve treatment, eliminate malpractices, correct military discipline, and pay attention to the ability and prestige of commanders. Retired officers are all soldiers who have contributed to the war of resistance. They should be quickly subsidized to return to their hometowns, and local governments should be given work opportunities or production subsidies. As for the Harbin issue, the area was originally the gateway to northeastern China and has now been occupied by the Communist army as a supply channel, which has a great impact on the military situation in the Northeast. Questions were raised and discussed at the review meeting, and it was hoped that the government would quickly seek recovery to cut off the source of trouble and comfort the people's aspirations. This opinion will be submitted to the General Assembly for approval and forwarded to the government for adoption and implementation.

### Currency Reform Issue to Be Implemented After the Overall Situation Stabilizes; Councilor Bao Yimin Asks for Cultural Loans

[Our Nanjing Office, 29th] Finance Minister Yu Hongjun said when attending the fourth review meeting of the Council on the 29th to report on the government's financial measures: currency reform and changing the currency unit should wait until the overall situation stabilizes, but the government is prepared for this. If the system is changed rashly and inflation continues in the future, the government will not be able to establish credit, and it will not help. Before the reform, the government must exchange sufficient foreign exchange.

[Our Nanjing Office, 29th] Councilor Bao Yimin believes that the current culture has a downward trend and that the country should urgently handle cultural loans to support the publishing industry in order to improve the country's cultural level and promote social progress. Bao has drafted a proposal to send to the People's Political Council, with several methods as follows: (1) The government orders the national banks to set up cultural loans. (2) The loan targets are divided into two types: publishing industry and authors. Those with good reputation and whose works are considered to have publishing value may apply for loans. (3) The loan interest rate and term are equal to or better than industrial loans. (4) The loan and procedures for authors to publish should be relaxed as much as possible.

### The Communist Personnel of the Executive Headquarters Refuse to Forward the Invitation Telegram of the Council, Saying That the Interruption of Contact Is Not an Accurate Statement

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 29th] The Communist Party personnel stationed in the Executive Headquarters replied to the People's Political Council in the name of the "Relief Headquarters" Shanghai office that the Yantai Executive Headquarters radio station has no contact with any Communist radio station and refused to send a telegram from the Council inviting the Communist councilors to Beijing. According to a political observer interviewed by the reporter, this is just an excuse for the Communist Party to refuse to attend the Council and refuse to resume peace talks, but it is not actually the case. It is found that the recent broadcasts of the Communist radio station all have news from Yantai. For example, the broadcast on the 15th of this month contained "Rapid Development Report of Industry and Commerce in Yantai City", and the 22nd contained "Sharp Drop in Foreign Exchange in Yantai City" and "Industry and Commerce in Yantai City" and other telegrams. Regardless of where the telegrams were sent from within Shandong Province, it can be seen that the contact between Yantai and the Communist Party headquarters has not been interrupted. The telegrams from Shanghai to the Communist councilors can still be indirectly delivered. The so-called inability to comply with the request to forward telegrams by the Communist Party personnel in Shanghai is nothing more than a deception.

### Mo Dehui Is Still Recuperating

He Hopes to Visit the Northeast

[Our Report] Mo Dehui is still recuperating at Zhongshan Hospital. His blood pressure has decreased and his spirits are good. He told reporters that the date of going to Beijing is undecided and everything depends on his health. After being away from Beijing for many days, he is out of touch with current affairs and needs to discuss with all parties before he can make any claims. However, peace and unity are inseparable, and which comes first is only a technical issue. Mo is eager to go to the Northeast after his strength recovers. He also said: The Northeast issue is of great importance. The Second World War originated in the Northeast. Efforts to solve the internal affairs problem can solve the Northeast problem. As far as international relations are concerned, there must be "interactions" and "involvements" between countries, so there is no need to overemphasize it. When talking about peace talks, Mo said: It may be too late to attend the People's Political Council. He hopes to have a meeting with all the councilors in Shanghai. Restoring peace talks is not a simple matter and is not a matter for one person or one party.

### The Organizational Committee of the Democratic Socialist Party Elects Xu Chuanlin as a Member of the Government Council

Mr. Xu Has Expressed His Acceptance

[Central News Agency, This City] Xu Fulin, Minister of Publicity of the Democratic Socialist Party, was decided by the organizational committee of the party yesterday to be recommended as a member of the National Government Council. Xu has expressed his acceptance.

[Our Report] The organizational committee of the Democratic Socialist Party held meetings yesterday morning and afternoon, chaired by Ji Yiqiao and Hu Haimen, respectively, and passed many proposals such as refreshing party affairs and adjusting personnel. Sun Baogang, Lu Guangsheng, Zai Shiming, and other party members who violated party discipline and participated in the Innovation Committee were unanimously approved to be expelled from the party membership and handed over to the Central Supervisory Committee for investigation and handling in accordance with Article 5 of the party's organizational law. Regarding the issue of the quorum of the organizational committee, it was also resolved to follow the precedent of the Second Organizational Committee Congress, with more than half of the number of committee members as the quorum. The party is scheduled to convene the Supervisory Committee this morning to determine the number of people to be expelled, and continue the general meeting in the afternoon.

### The Organization Regulations of the Design and Evaluation Office Are Passed

[Our Nanjing Office, 29th] The regulations on the organization of the National Government Design and Evaluation Office were finally passed at the 326th regular meeting of the Legislative Yuan on the 29th after repeated review and discussion by the Legislative Yuan. The biggest change in the articles passed this time is to change the original Article 1, which stipulated the responsibilities of the office, which included the design and evaluation of political and economic affairs, etc., to "the design and evaluation of national administration affairs." Liu Kejun, chairman of the legal system committee, said when explaining the review process: When the case was discussed at the General Assembly and the review committee, the legislators all believed that the office was a staff organization for the chairman, and the National Economic Commission was in charge of the design of economic policies, so there were the above changes. A larger change here is to reduce the number of staff, which was originally quite large, as much as possible. According to the three organizational regulations passed today, the National Government Design and Evaluation Office will set up a design bureau, an evaluation bureau, and a secretariat, with one design and evaluation director, one director and one deputy director for the design bureau, and one director and one deputy director for the old evaluation bureau.

### The Amendment to the Trade Union Law Is Passed; The Clause on Restricting Strikes Has Been Deleted

[Our Nanjing Office, 29th] The amendment to the Trade Union Law has completed the legislative process after fierce debate at the 326th regular meeting of the Legislative Yuan on the 29th. The full text of the law has 63 articles. After it was proposed, Chen Xiaocen, convener of the Labor Law Committee, first explained the main points of the law, roughly saying that after this amendment, trade unions began to have national organizations. As for workers joining trade unions, the draft does not adopt a registration system, but a permission system. Regarding the issue of strikes, the draft stipulates that workers in public utilities and transportation industries are not allowed to strike, and it is stipulated that wages will not be paid during the strike period. Then the discussion began. Most legislators believed that the restrictions on strikes should not be too strict, and advocated deleting the last two clauses of Article 28 regarding strikes. President Sun also believed that strikes by public utility and transportation workers should not be prohibited, because such regulations are not in line with modern trends and violate democratic principles. He also cited examples to illustrate that if the law prohibits strikes by public utility and transportation workers, how should strikes by coal mine and other power workers be handled? Is it not contradictory to only prohibit the former and allow coal mine workers to strike? Legislation should adapt to the spirit of the times, and the above two clauses should be deleted. Chen Guyuan and others also believed that wages should still be paid to strikers to show sympathy. The final resolution was to delete the two clauses, and there were no major changes to the other clauses, and the entire case was passed. (The full text of the Trade Union Law will be published on the seventh edition of the 31st)

### The Legislative Yuan Holds All-Day Meeting; Approves the Sino-American Air Transport Agreement After Amending the Internal Organization Law; Minister of Agriculture Attends to Report on the Work Overview

[Our Nanjing Office, 29th] The 326th regular meeting of the Legislative Yuan was held all day on the 29th due to the large number of bills and fierce debates. The meeting opened at 9:30 am and adjourned at 1 pm. It resumed at 3:30 pm and adjourned at about 5 pm. Both meetings were chaired by President Sun, and more than 100 legislators attended. At the morning meeting, Minister of Agriculture Zuo Shunsheng attended to answer questions related to agriculture and forestry. Ten important cases were passed today, the main ones being: (1) the Organization Law of the National Government Design and Evaluation Office, (2) the amendment to the Trade Union Law, (3) the amendment to the Stamp Tax Law, (4) the amendment to the Organization Law of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, (5) the Sino-American Air Transport Agreement, and (6) the Sino-Afghanistan Treaty of Friendship. The issue of the number of occupational representatives among the legislators was also discussed at the meeting.

[Our Nanjing Office, 29th] At the 326th regular meeting of the Legislative Yuan on the morning of the 29th, the new Minister of Agriculture and Forestry, Zuo Shunsheng, gave a brief report on the work overview of the ministry, roughly saying that the ministry has more than 40 affiliated institutions. Due to limited funding and manpower, the work has not been as ideal as expected. However, some institutions have achieved considerable work performance due to the proper coordination of talents, even though funding is tight. The cotton industry institutions in Nanjing, Shanghai, and other places are examples. Zuo believes that if agricultural and forestry work only starts from production and does not pay attention to research work, confusion will inevitably occur and will affect production. According to the results of his inspection in the two weeks since taking office, he knows that research work, although it seems too circuitous, is not to be blamed. Some legislators inquired about the messy organization of the Ministry of Agriculture, the inconsistent authority, and the unreasonable division of power between the central and local governments, hoping to improve.

### The Number of Occupational Representatives Among Legislators Is Handed Over to the Two Committees for Discussion

[Our Nanjing Office, 29th] The issue of increasing the number of occupational representatives among legislators was proposed for reconsideration at the afternoon meeting of the Legislative Yuan on the 29th. Since there were still points worthy of discussion in terms of procedure, it was decided to hand it over to the Constitutional Law Committee and the Legal System Committee for discussion first. After the case was proposed at the meeting on the 29th, Liu Kejun, chairman of the Constitutional Law Committee, first reported on the review process, roughly saying that the Law on the Election and Recall of Legislators had been passed by the Legislative Yuan and promulgated by the National Government. The National Government believed that it was necessary to increase the number of occupational representatives among legislators, so it handed over the case to the Legislative Yuan for reconsideration. The Constitutional Law Committee held a meeting for discussion on the 27th. The opinions at the meeting can be roughly summarized into the following categories: (1) According to Article 4 of the Law on the Election and Recall of Legislators, the total number of legislators has reached more than 700, which is already extremely large and should not be increased further. (2) The original article stipulates that the number of occupational representatives is 56, which is determined by referring to one-tenth of the number of regional representatives. Now that the number of regional representatives has increased to 670, the number of occupational representatives can be increased proportionally to 67. (3) In accordance with the order of the National Government, the number of occupational representatives will be increased to 110. (4) According to 15% of the total number of legislators, which is more than 670, the number of occupational representatives will be increased to 102. (5) The number of occupational representatives will be determined according to the number of members of national professional groups. (6) A decision will not be made temporarily and will be sent to the General Assembly for discussion. In the end, it was decided to adopt the sixth method. The Constitutional Law Committee did not make any resolution on the matter and only sent the case to the General Assembly for a decision. After Liu finished reporting, Liu Butong, a legislator, first spoke and expressed his disagreement with increasing the number of occupational representatives, and gave five reasons to explain that even if it were increased, it could only be increased from 56 to 67. Legislator Lu Fu pointed out the difference between reconsideration and amendment. It is said that if there are places that need to be corrected in the content of the law before it completes the legislative process and is promulgated, and it is submitted to the legislative body for discussion again, it is called "reconsideration." If the law has completed the legislation and has been promulgated and implemented, it is called "amendment" if there is a need to make further amendments and it is submitted to the legislative body for discussion. The nature of the two is completely different. The Law on the Election and Recall of Legislators has long been completed by the Legislative Yuan and promulgated by the National Government on March 31 this year. The National Government has recently handed over the number of occupational representatives among legislators to the Legislative Yuan for "reconsideration," and the procedure is somewhat inconsistent. Moreover, even if there is no reconsideration and the Legislative Yuan is ordered to amend the law, it is also inconsistent with the law. According to international practice, the laws passed by the current session cannot be amended again in the same session. Moreover, since the promulgation of the Law on the Election and Recall of Legislators, no flaws have been found, and there is a need for the Legislative Yuan to amend it. Lu concluded that the law is not a child's play, and legislation has its dignity, and the number of occupational representatives can no longer be increased. Sun Jiulu and others also spoke, expressing that the number cannot be increased again. The final resolution was that since there are problems with the procedure, the Legislative Yuan will not make any resolution on the matter of the number of occupational representatives among legislators, and will first hand over the case to the Constitutional Law Committee and the Legal System Committee for joint discussion, and then report to the General Assembly.

### The Legislative Election Districts of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Hunan, Guangdong, and Other Provinces Are Determined

In addition, at the meeting on the 29th, the issue of the division of legislative regions in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and other provinces has also been decided. Jinshan in Jiangsu Province is included in the first district, Gaochun is included in the second district, Xianju in Zhejiang Province is moved to the third district, Wencheng is added to the third district, Ninghai is moved to the second district, and Fenhui, Tonglu, Jiande, and Chun'an are moved to the fourth district. In addition, the zoning issues in Hunan and Guangdong have also been resolved. As for the issue of overseas Chinese representatives, the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission intends to increase the number from 19 to 25. On the issue of the number of representatives from Tibet, Zhao Weipei suggested increasing it from 10 to 12, and Liu Jiaju advocated increasing it from 10 to 20. The meeting did not discuss it and did not make any decision.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 29th] Councilors Wang Xiaolai, Wu Yunzu, Jiang Yiping, and others, believing that the Legislative Yuan will convene a meeting on the 29th to decide on the number of legislative members of professional groups, visited President Sun at 5 pm on the 28th, hoping that the Legislative Yuan would temporarily postpone the discussion on this issue so that there would be sufficient time to consider the proposals of the People's Political Council. Wang and others then separately conveyed their wishes to Gu Zhenggang, Minister of Social Affairs, and Chen Lifu, Minister of Organization, and Ma Chaojun, Minister of Labor, unanimously supporting this principle and not making a rigid decision hastily.

[Another Dispatch] The list of the number of legislators and the division of election districts in Jiangsu Province has been passed by the Legislative Yuan meeting on the 29th.

This resolution was decided by the Legislative Yuan at the afternoon regular meeting on the 29th after two temporary motions were proposed by legislators Lu Fu, Fu Tongxian, and others. Lu Fu's motion suggested inviting President Zhang to the Legislative Yuan to answer questions related to the student protests, public security, and the closure of the three newspapers. Fu's temporary motion proposed inviting Minister Zhu to the Legislative Yuan to explain the handling of the student protests and the measures to deal with student movements in the future, so that the colleagues of the Legislative Yuan could make suggestions on the student protests issue. Some legislators believed that the above issues were not only related to education, but also related to internal affairs and news, and hoped that Minister Zhang and Director Dong could also come to the Legislative Yuan. It was decided to invite Zhang, Zhu, Zhang, and Dong to answer together. However, there were still half a months until the next meeting, and the time was too long. It would be best to hold a meeting before June 2nd. Finally, it was decided that the temporary meeting would be held on the morning of the 30th.

### The Issue of US Loans to China; Marshall Urges the Export-Import Bank to Implement Them Soon

[United Press, Washington, 28th] Sources here say that Secretary of State Marshall believes that it is almost impossible to obtain Congressional approval for economic assistance to China before next year. Therefore, he is currently urging the Export-Import Bank of the United States to lend some loans to China as soon as possible to meet the urgent needs of its recovery work.

It is also learned that the leader of the Chinese supply delegation returned to this place from Nanjing a few days ago, carrying China's plan to use Export-Import Bank loans. The bank now insists that it needs to study and approve its plan before it can withdraw some loans from the $500 million loan.

### Central University Administrative Council Issues a Letter Urging Students to Return to Class; Peking Students Establish a Committee to Resume Classes

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 29th] The Central University Administrative Council today passed a letter urging students to return to class, stating in brief: The student movement at Central University has had a glorious history. The two movements of "January 25th" and "February 22nd" last year, with their just and far-reaching goals, strict and reasonable organization, and disciplined actions, achieved great results with little sacrifice of time, and gained widespread sympathy and praise. This strike has lasted for more than half a month, occupying one-fifth of the teaching time of this semester, causing the school to fall into a state of stagnation and chaos. The school's construction and the students' studies have suffered great losses. It must be understood that to "rescue education," one must first rescue the school; to rescue the school, one must first love the school and value studies. The students have already suffered great losses in their studies during the War of Resistance and the post-war recovery period, and it is already too late to make up for them. How can they continue to sacrifice in this way? Striving for peace is the unanimous demand of the people of the whole country. To ensure its success, it is necessary to propose just, reasonable, and acceptable opinions and plans from a detached standpoint. If there is a need to express something, it can be reasonably proposed at any time. Why predetermine a demonstration parade on June 2nd so early, which coincides with the anniversary of the anti-civil war movement stipulated by Yan'an last year, and is very easy to make people in the society suspect that this movement is closely related to party strife? It must be understood that the school is sacred and must never be allowed to become a place for party strife. Moreover, Peking University, Tsinghua University, and other schools that went on strike later have already resumed classes. Recently, the Political Consultative Council has responded to the students' opinions to the government. It is hoped that the students will return to class as soon as possible with the enthusiasm of loving the school and loving their studies.

[Central News Agency, Peking, 29th] Students in Peking universities who oppose the strike have recently established a "Committee for Resuming Classes in Various Universities" and issued a declaration, exposing the faces of conspirators who sacrifice the studies of young people, saying: "We absolutely do not oppose this student movement launched to demand increased public funding, increased food allowances, and increased teachers' salaries, but we are saddened that our movement has changed its nature in the middle, and has been changed by the monetary power of 436.5 million yuan. Our pure youth have become tools used by others in political struggles." It also pointed out that the huge expenditure of funds for this student unrest is enough to offset the public funding of various universities in Peking for a month with surplus.

### We Demand Japan Compensate 1 Million Tons of Ships to Transport Reparations Materials Home

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 28th] Officials from the Reparations and Restitution Group of our delegation to Japan told a Central News Agency reporter that given China's current shipping tonnage, port facilities, and transportation equipment, it would take two to three years to transport the 480,000 tons of machinery and industrial equipment Japan owes China in reparations back home. The port facilities capable of unloading reparations materials are inadequate, and floating docks are urgently needed due to the lack of wharves in China. The first step in transporting the first batch of reparations from Japan is to prepare 70 cranes, ranging in capacity from 10 tons to 150 tons. To prevent mishandling or miscalculation of Allied materials, China must acquire transportation equipment and a large number of spare parts and repair materials. China lacks ships, so it is hoped that the work of reparations in the form of Japanese ships can be successful. However, the work here is still disappointing. Although the work has been underway for a year, only four ships have been returned, with two more to be returned soon. Due to this severe lack of ships, the Reparations and Restitution Group recently joined with the Merchant Ship Reparations Committee to propose that our government demand 1 million tons of Japanese ships, of which 500,000 tons should be selected from the existing Japanese fleet, and the other 500,000 tons should be delivered within four years as newly built ships.

Editorial

### Achievements of the British Labour Government

The British Labour Party conference opened in Margate on the 26th. In the days that followed, the conference discussed current domestic and foreign policy of England. The opposition’s shouts outside the conference and the disputes at the conference might cause a political upheaval in England. However, the British people are a resolute and calm nation, who value reason over emotion. Even in moments of emotional intensity, they can remain calm. Though they have different positions, they are all the same in their care for the country and their understanding of the difficult times. Thus, the air of this Labour Party conference was very tense, and the strength of the opposition was also very great, but it did not cause a storm in British politics from beginning to end. This cannot but be said to be due to the success of the British Labour Government in its two years in power, and their nation’s democratic character is indeed worthy of admiration. In today's turbulent world after the war, the British Labour Party has achieved this in its two years in power, which is really worthy of the world's attention. The Labour Party's arduous struggle has finally overcome economic difficulties, which is especially worthy of the unanimous attention of our Chinese government and people. "Stones from other hills can be used to polish jade." The authorities of the Chinese Kuomintang should be more humble and learn from it!

The flames of the Second World War were like a symbol of the decline of the British Empire. Most people were worried about it. During the war, the British themselves were worried about the future of Britain after the war, no matter how the war ended. After the end of the war, Britain had to rely on the assistance and support of other countries because of the successive departures of India and its dominions and the scarcity of domestic materials. The tragedy of Britain's future led to an unprecedented defeat for the Conservative Party, which had made great contributions to the victory in the war, in the first general election in Britain after the war. The Labour Party leader, Attlee, took Churchill's place and replaced him. On August 28, 1945, everyone knew that Attlee felt both happy and afraid when he went to 10 Downing Street to work for the first time. He could give full play to his political wisdom as the leader of the Labour Party from now on, but he was afraid that the future of Britain would be full of thorns. How to safely overcome the many difficulties in front of him was a serious question. Therefore, the Labour Party has been in power for nearly two years, and there has not been a day without being in a precarious situation, and there has not been a day without working hard in fear and trepidation. As far as the international situation is concerned, creating world peace is not an easy task. It is even more difficult than the Allied forces winning the war. The fact that the United States and the Soviet Union have not been able to get along with each other after the war and the two forces that are almost incompatible have made Britain feel very uneasy. Although Britain regards peace as the keynote of its foreign policy, it is not easy for the diplomatic authorities to solve the distress of where to go and what to do in the cracks between the United States and the Soviet Union. As far as the domestic situation is concerned, its seriousness is no less than that during the war. There is a shortage of all the materials needed for people's daily life. The wartime rationing system is still in place for food and clothing. The Labour government often feels that it has no way out in order to cope with the domestic housing shortage, coal shortage, and food shortage. Sometimes they cannot help but be at a loss, but after hard struggles, they have finally overcome the difficulties safely one after another. When we recall the internal affairs and foreign affairs of Britain in the past two years, we cannot but express our admiration for the Labour government's hard work.

However, from another perspective, the domestic and foreign policies implemented by the British Labour cabinet are not completely free from criticism. As far as foreign policy is concerned, almost all the measures taken by the Labour government to deal with India, Palestine, and Egypt have been opposed by the Conservative Party. Therefore, in the House of Commons, it is often criticized by opposition leaders such as Churchill and Eden. However, Foreign Secretary Bevin's position in previous international conferences often coincided with that of the United States, and invisibly created a situation in which Britain and the United States jointly dealt with the Soviet Union. Therefore, it is often criticized by the so-called "rebellious members" of the Labour Party, who accuse the Labour Party's foreign policy of being no different from that of the Conservative Party. Therefore, in the House of Commons, the Labour government is also often ridiculed by the leaders of the rebels, Zilliacus and Crossman. On the eve of the opening of the Labour Party Congress, they also distributed pamphlets everywhere, "Keep Left," demanding that the Labour Party adopt a pro-Soviet and anti-American foreign policy. The Labour Party also distributed a pamphlet called "Cards on the Table," which meant to accuse the Soviet Union of not being able to cooperate sincerely, to answer the questions of the "rebellious elements." The issue of this foreign policy will also be taken out for discussion at the Labour Party Congress, and a heated debate is likely to be unavoidable.

Secondly, with regard to the domestic economy, in the past two years, the Labour government has continued to promote the method of nationalizing all enterprises in accordance with the Labour Party's established program. It has been promoted from nationalizing coal to nationalizing transportation. As far as the Labour Party is concerned, this is a kind of Labour Party social and economic policy, and it can only be implemented to see its effectiveness. However, as far as the Conservative Party is concerned, this is regarded as the best material to oppose the Labour cabinet. Therefore, Churchill often takes the opportunity to attack the Labour Party with the Labour Party's nationalization policy. On the other hand, the British Labour government, constrained by the domestic material environment, although it wants to do its best to improve the economic life of the people, Prime Minister Attlee is ultimately unable to create a miracle and make the British people well-fed and clothed in one fell swoop. Because of this, the British people's food and clothing still maintain the wartime rationing system, which makes people who have high hopes for the Labour Party have to express disappointment; especially the radical elements within the Labour Party, who are not very satisfied with the Labour government's economic policy. A part of the Labour Party members have put forward six requirements in order to enable Britain to become economically self-reliant: (1) Draft a plan to uniformly control labor and restrict the employment of workers in secondary industries; (2) Increase the allocation of US dollars for the purchase of American machinery and equipment; (3) Increase the number of members of the Mixed Production Committee; (4) Implement a production subsidy system; (5) Revise the current income tax system; (6) Ban the import of luxury goods. It is expected that a heated debate will be triggered when this proposal is put forward for discussion. However, we know that the most important issues in the British economy are to increase production and increase export trade. However, under the current situation of material shortages in Britain, it is indeed not an easy task to increase production and increase export trade. "A clever woman cannot cook without rice," this issue remains to be discussed at length at the Labour Party Congress.

In short, although the British Labour government has not achieved brilliant achievements in its two years in power, it has been able to face reality, be down-to-earth, and work hard in this difficult environment. It has not only solved many problems for Britain, but also turned danger into safety everywhere, enabling Britain to overcome many difficulties. It is difficult and valuable. Prime Minister Attlee's contribution to the revival of Britain should not be underestimated by the world. The achievements of the British Labour government in its two years in power are enough to prove the success of the moderate economic revolution, which is most worthy of our government's attention. Looking at others and thinking about ourselves, we cannot help but feel a lot of emotions!

### Indian National Congress Informs British Government that Partition Plan is Difficult to Accept; Gandhi Accuses British of Disregarding Indian Minorities

[Reuters, London, 29th] Viceroy Mountbatten and his wife returned to New Delhi by private plane at 7:15 this morning, carrying a plan for the transfer of power to India approved by the British Cabinet. Ismay, Chief of Staff to the Viceroy, and Watson, his private secretary, accompanied them on the same plane.

[Agence France-Presse, London, 28th] According to sources from the Indian National Congress here, the Congress has informed the British government that it cannot accept the plan to divide India into Hindustan and Pakistan under any circumstances.

[Agence France-Presse, New Delhi, 28th] Gandhi said in a speech tonight that Britain must kill him, Gandhi, before it can divide India. If Britain is sincere, it must fulfill its promise and withdraw from India. After Britain withdraws, whether India can resolve the matter peacefully or through civil war is none of Britain's business. He also said that the Viceroy's practice of disregarding minorities such as Christians and Parsees whenever important discussions are held is inappropriate.

[Reuters, New Delhi, 28th] Rumors are circulating in India that large-scale bloodshed and riots will occur throughout the country after the Viceroy presents the plan for the transfer of power to Indian leaders on June 2nd. Gandhi and Sikh leader Singh have both mentioned this matter separately. Gandhi urged the people not to worry or fear in a prayer meeting, saying, "If the Muslims say, 'If you don't give me Pakistan, I will use my sword,' we should answer, 'We will never give you Pakistan. You can cut me or the country into pieces.' If you have the courage to say this, then God will break the Muslims' swords." Sikh leader Singh said in a speech in Lahore, the capital of Punjab Province, that unrest may occur in Punjab after June 2nd, but he hopes that the plan announced by the Viceroy can ensure that the Sikhs in the province receive fair treatment. Leaders of the Muslim League, Congress, Sikhs, and other factions in Punjab Province convened a roundtable conference in Lahore today to discuss the issue of restoring order in the province. Nehru is expected to arrive in Lahore tomorrow. At the same time, the General Headquarters announced that the Fourth Indian Division, a division that had fought alongside the British Eighth Army in North Africa and Italy, has been transferred from southern India to Punjab Province as a precaution. British Commander-in-Chief Auchinleck will rush back to India from London within days to take command.

### British Labour Party Annual Conference Vote: Support for Bevin's Foreign Policy; Proposal to Cut Military Spending Rejected

[Our Dispatch] London, 29th (via broadcast): The British Labour Party's annual conference has almost unanimously voted in favor of Bevin's foreign policy. Among the 1,200 delegates, only a few dozen voted against it. Prior to the vote, Bevin delivered a 90-minute speech criticizing the left-wing members of the Labour Party in Parliament for launching "cold arrows" at him while he was engaged in important negotiations with the U.S. government.

[Our Dispatch] London, 29th (via broadcast): At today's British Labour Party annual conference, Labour MPs such as Zilliacus, who oppose the "excessive" closeness of Britain and the United States and are pro-Soviet, vehemently criticized Bevin's pro-American foreign policy and proposed a motion to strengthen British-Soviet friendship, requesting the conference to pass it. When Bevin stepped onto the podium, he was warmly welcomed, and the majority of the delegates indicated that they would continue to support his foreign policy.

[Associated Press, Margate, 28th]: During the initial debate on Bevin's foreign policy at the Labour Party's annual conference today, left-wing members demanded a review of military obligations and the allocation and organization of the military, with the aim of significantly reducing the government's goals set for March 1, 1948. This comprehensive proposal was rejected by 237,000 votes to 109,000. In addition, the government also won victories on proposals for economic planning and electricity production to address the national economic crisis.

### British Chancellor of the Exchequer Advocates Self-Reliance; Urges No More Dependence on Foreign Debt

[United Press, Margate, 28th]: Chancellor of the Exchequer Dalton stated in a speech at the Labour Party conference today that Britain must no longer rely on loans from the United States. He hoped that the conference would reject or withdraw the anti-government resolutions proposed on the issues of manpower and foreign policy. With the U.S. loan nearing exhaustion, we must no longer rely on foreign debt and must seek self-reliance. The future of Britain depends entirely on increasing exports to balance imports; otherwise, we will have to reduce imports. This is the most significant test currently facing Britain, and the success or failure of the nation's future hinges on it.

### Deepening Divisions Within the Labour Party; Executive Committee Indirectly Acknowledges It

[Agence France-Presse, Margate, 28th]: Regarding the book "Cards on the Table," distributed by the Labour Party secretariat to the conference a few days ago, the Labour Party's executive committee has issued a statement to the conference about the book, which almost indirectly acknowledges the divisions within the Labour Party. It stated briefly that the book was published by the Labour Party but was not intended to explain the party's policy, only as a "contribution" to the discussion of foreign policy. Some observers believe that the Labour Party's executive committee's statement today has exposed its predicament. There are two major facts at today's Labour Party conference that are worth noting: a large number of Labour Party members supported by the miners' and engineers' associations demanded (1) the restoration of the "Direction of Labour" system and (2) the establishment of a consistent wage policy. However, the conference, following the demands of the opposition associations, rejected both of the above requirements.

### Change of Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister

Bogomolov Succeeds

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 28th]: News received here today from Moscow states that the Soviet authorities issued an order on January 24th of this year, appointing the Ambassador to France, Bogomolov, as Deputy Foreign Minister. The Soviet authorities also issued an order on March 19th, removing Dekanozov from the post of Deputy Foreign Minister. The above two orders were published in the Soviet official gazette on May 7th, but the Soviet newspapers have not yet commented on them.

### Turkey's Firm Stance: Determined to Safeguard Territorial Integrity; Parliament Approves Extension of State of Emergency on Turkish Borders

[Reuters, Ankara, 29th]: Turkish Prime Minister Bayar told Parliament that a certain foreign country, under the pretext of joint defense measures, has sent a note to the Turkish government requesting to obtain bases in Turkey, and that Turkey is now facing demands that are almost equivalent to territorial demands. Although Turkey is in an atmosphere filled with danger, it must maintain a firm attitude. These territorial demands do not seem to be abandoned, so the Turkish government, after careful consideration, has decided that it cannot implement the demobilization of the army under the current circumstances. We must not ignore the significant burden on our nation's future. This year, Turkey has become the cornerstone of the Middle East, the Orient, and the Eastern Mediterranean. Turkey still does not know when it will face the threat of internal forces, and although this is only a possibility, it cannot be said to be impossible. The Turkish Prime Minister then requested Parliament to approve the extension of the "state of emergency" declared in the European part of Turkey and the area near Greece and the islands since 1940, and Parliament approved the extension.

[Reuters, London, 28th]: Ankara Radio reported that Turkish Prime Minister Bayar told an American reporter that Turkey is willing to maintain friendship with the Soviet Union but will never accept friendship under "Munich conditions." Fortunately, there are currently no Chamberlains or Daladiers in power to force Turkey to accept "Munich-style" conditions to appease the Soviet Union. Turkey is very willing to adopt a good-neighborly policy towards the Soviet Union. In order to restore friendship between the two countries, the Soviet Union must abandon its intention to infringe upon Turkey's territorial integrity. Turkey will never agree to or even discuss the transfer of land or allow foreign countries to use Turkish bases.

### The Four Powers Will Meet in London to Discuss the Issue of Italian Territories in Africa; Inevitably Involving Important Interests of Various Countries

[Reuters, London, 29th]: The Four Powers will soon meet in London to discuss the future of the Italian colonies. The main difficulty is that establishing a trusteeship over any of these Italian African colonies will involve significant strategic interests. The extent of this importance can only be measured after the following four issues are resolved: (1) Egypt's appeal to the Security Council to have British troops withdraw from the Suez Canal Zone and Sudan; (2) The United Nations General Assembly's discussion of the Palestine issue, which will ultimately determine whether Britain will end its mandate and withdraw its troops stationed in the Holy Land; (3) The attempt to revise the 1926 Montreux Convention, and whether the Soviet Union can obtain a military base in the Dardanelles Strait, which can only be determined after the Strait Convention is revised; (4) Italy's current domestic political crisis, the outcome of which may determine the degree to which the powers are willing to consider Italy's request for a trusteeship over part of its colonies. Until the former issues are resolved, Britain cannot formulate a final defense plan for the Near East, which may involve the development of bases in East Africa to determine Abyssinia's claims to Eritrea. Before the issues of Palestine and Egypt are resolved, it is difficult for the powers to determine the demands made by Arab countries representing the Arab residents of North Africa. Before the issue of the Black Sea Straits is resolved, the Soviet Union cannot quickly decide whether to abandon its demand for a sole trusteeship over Libya. The Soviet Union raised this demand at the London Foreign Ministers' Conference in September 1945, but Britain firmly opposed it, arguing that a sole Soviet trusteeship over Libya would be the most serious threat to the Suez Canal. Since the announcement of the Truman Doctrine, the international situation has become more complicated, and it is difficult to predict whether the United States will therefore oppose the Soviet Union's sole trusteeship. To speak of joint trusteeship, it will likely be difficult at the beginning of implementation. The prolonged indecision on the Korean issue makes this clear.

### US-Soviet Committee Negotiations Still Unsuccessful

[Our Dispatch] San Francisco, 29th (via broadcast): Soviet and American military representatives to Korea, Shtikov and Brown, resumed negotiations today on the issue of the Korean political system. The results were not announced, and both sides are scheduled to issue a communique on Saturday.

Another report: Today's negotiations did not achieve any success.

[United Press, Seoul, 29th]: U.S. Chief Representative to the U.S.-Soviet Joint Commission, General Brown, requested Soviet Chief Representative General Shtikov on the morning of the 29th to immediately reopen the commission to discuss selecting representatives from Korean political parties and individuals to invite to the meeting for consultation purposes. The subcommittee designated to discuss the selection of representatives from Korean political parties and individuals failed to reach an agreement. The U.S. representatives reported this deadlock to Brown on the evening of the 29th.

### Authorities in British and American Occupation Zones Announce Establishment of Economic Committee in Germany; Invite Soviet and French Participation in Economic Merger Plan

[Our Dispatch] London, 29th (via broadcast): British Deputy Military Governor of Germany Robertson and U.S. Commander-in-Chief Clay jointly announced today the establishment of the "All-German Economic Committee" to plan the construction of the two occupation zones. With the establishment of this committee, the Germans themselves have gained the greatest economic power since the end of the war. However, in today's communique, both the British and American sides solemnly declared that the committee must obtain the consent of both the British and American sides before taking action.

[Associated Press, Berlin, 29th]: The German Economic Committee will consist of 54 members, who will be elected by the state parliaments of Germany. Clay and Robertson jointly notified that the Soviet and French governments were again invited to participate in the economic merger between the U.S. and British zones, which has been implemented since January 1st.

### Marshall Urges Senate Approval of St. Lawrence River Development Treaty; Aims to Strengthen US-Canada Joint Defense

[Reuters, Washington, 28th]: Secretary of State Marshall, former President Hoover, and others provided opinions to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which is currently reviewing the $500 million international development plan. When referring to the treaty concluded between the United States and Canada to develop the St. Lawrence River, Secretary of State Marshall strongly urged the Senate to approve the treaty immediately, as the development plan would greatly help the United States and Canada jointly defend the North American continent. After the completion of the St. Lawrence River project, it would allow giant ocean-going ships to be built in relatively safe inland rivers, open a new and important transportation line to the industrial heartland of the United States, and its hydropower generation would be comparable to the power generation of the Tennessee River Valley and the Columbia Colorado River Valley. These developments are all prerequisites for the development of atomic energy. Hoover's words concerned the world food problem. He said: If maritime transportation is smooth, all of the United States' surplus grain can be transported abroad to relieve disaster victims. Currently, at most, only 1.5 million tons of grain can be supplied to the other side of the Atlantic every day.

### Britain Expresses Great Approval for Military Cooperation in the Western Hemisphere

[Central News Agency, London, 28th (United Press)]: Senior government officials today stated that Britain expressed great approval for Truman's statement on military cooperation in the Western Hemisphere. Regarding the suggestion that Truman made to Canada, the official stated that Britain, at last year's Commonwealth Conference in London, had decided to negotiate with the territories on participating in regional defense agreements such as the one proposed by Truman. Canada's participation in this defense agreement would strengthen military ties between Britain and the United States and would allow the armies of the Americas to coordinate with Britain and the countries of the Western European Hemisphere.

### Three-Party Cabinet in Japan Gradually Taking Shape; Socialist Party Compromises; Democratic Party's Four Conditions Fully Accepted

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 29th]: The political situation has entered the stage of a three-party coalition cabinet. The Socialist Party, keenly aware of the need to bring the Democratic Party into the cabinet, is making every effort to compromise in future negotiations with the Democratic Party. It will state in its declaration that the Socialist Party has severed ties with the Communist Party. Regarding the ratio of cabinet posts, it plans to be six, six, two. Regarding concrete policies, it will respect the Democratic Party's proposals as much as possible. If the Democratic Party still does not join the cabinet, it plans to form a two-party cabinet with the People's Cooperative Party.

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 29th]: Prime Minister Katayama summoned Democratic Party leaders Ashida and Shidehara at noon on the 29th at the Prime Minister's official residence and requested their final cooperation on the cabinet formation issue. In response, the Democratic Party convened a special meeting in the afternoon and decided to accept the Socialist Party's request, but with the following conditions: (1) Cabinet meeting secrets must never be divulged; (2) Actions that cause social unrest must not be taken; (3) Absolutely no extreme right-wing or extreme left-wing actions must be taken; (4) If any of the above conditions are violated, each party shall take responsible measures. The above four conditions were notified to the Socialist Party by Matsumoto representing the Democratic Party. After receiving the conditions proposed by the Democratic People's Party, the Socialist Party convened a central executive committee at 5:00 PM and resolved to fully accept the four conditions, and immediately sent personnel to the Liberal Party, Democratic Party, and People's Cooperative Party to notify them of the contents of the agreement between the Socialist and Democratic parties.

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 29th]: After receiving the notification from the Socialist Party that it had acknowledged the conditions proposed by the Democratic Party, the Democratic Party convened an executive meeting starting at 7:00 PM to discuss the attitude it should adopt towards the Katayama cabinet in the future. Centered on Ashida, Shidehara, and Saito, three factions with left-wing, right-wing, and centrist opinions formed, and no conclusion was reached. Finally, it was decided to postpone the discussion to the 30th, and the meeting adjourned at 9:00 PM.

### Rumor That Ashida Hitoshi Will Be Purged

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 28th]: According to the most reliable sources, Democratic Party President Ashida Hitoshi will be purged from the party, and it is rumored that the purge order will be issued after the current cabinet is formed.

There are currently US troops stationed on Manus Island, and Australia has raised questions with the United States about its continued use.

### Siamese Cabinet Resigns En Masse

[Central News Agency, Bangkok, 28th]: Although the Siamese House of Representatives has passed a vote of confidence after a week of general debate, the government today submitted a mass resignation to the Regency Council. It is expected that Phra Prichanusat will be summoned to form a new cabinet.

### LaGuardia Awarded the "One World" Prize

[Central News Agency, New York, 28th]: Former UNRRA Director LaGuardia, film star Fredric March, and conductor Toscanini have recently been awarded the 1947 certificates by the "One World" Committee. LaGuardia also received the opportunity to fly around the world for the second annual "One World" Committee's memorial to Wendell Willkie.

### Special Committee for Guidance on Student Unrest Resolves to: Comfort Students, Investigate the Truth; Those Arrested for Overstepping Boundaries to Be Treated Leniently by Authorities; All Actions to Proceed After Reporting to the Assembly

[Our Dispatch] The Special Committee for Guidance on Student Unrest of the Municipal Council held a meeting at the council at 3:00 PM yesterday to discuss guidance methods, chaired by Wang Zhengting. More than a dozen councilors present spoke one after another. As a result, four points of action were passed, and it was decided to continue the meeting at 3:00 PM today to finalize the "Letter to Students," etc., and to proceed after reporting to the Assembly.

Wang Zhengting first stated: This time, the majority of students were incited by a small number of unscrupulous elements, resulting in student unrest. Fortunately, it is now gradually subsiding. He hopes that students can resume classes in good faith. He was also entrusted by Lu Ganchen, the General Secretary of the Youth Association, to appeal on his behalf that some students have been arrested recently, and he hopes that the government authorities can turn big issues into small issues and small issues into no issues. Tao Baichuan stated that the current task is to ensure that the beaten students receive comfort and protection, and then to provide guidance; otherwise, if strong measures continue to be adopted, the situation will deteriorate further. He hopes that the government authorities will avoid stimulation and that even arrested students should be given less stimulation. Ye Fenghu advocated starting from the root cause, finding ways for the pure and good students' proposals to be realized, and guiding them in the direction they should go, so that student unrest can be avoided in the future. He suggested that councilors, in their personal capacity, investigate the truth in the schools concerned. Wang Weiyin proposed stopgap measures, such as organizing visiting groups to investigate various schools separately. Fundamental methods, such as having the schools elect legal student union representatives, and having the council directly discuss matters with the representatives, etc. Pang Jingzhou said that organizing visiting groups seemed too rushed in terms of time. Could emergency methods be adopted, such as inviting the heads of various schools to have a symposium with the council? Zai Zhuyi stated that the content and factors of the incidents in various schools are different, so solutions should be sought by addressing individual problems. The government authorities should reduce stimulation, and news published in newspapers should not be too激動. He suggested starting today to exchange opinions with the principals of various schools separately. Zhao Yangxiong stated: (1) Among the arrested students, there are those who advocate strikes and those who advocate resuming classes. Should the council express a fair attitude regarding whether it advocates their release? (2) Should the injured students be comforted? (3) Some school principals and other responsible persons are resigning. Should they be retained? (4) Should student parents be consulted to persuade and restrain their children? Zhao Junhao suggested that the council appoint representatives to comfort the injured students. Huang Shijin hopes that the authorities will understand the psychology of young people and must not add fuel to the fire by arresting students. He agreed with the opinion of the Yenching University professor that teachers who are respected by the students should provide guidance.

### Four Points of Action Decided

As a result of the discussion, four points of action were tentatively decided: (1) Members of the committee who are alumni of the universities concerned will go to the respective schools to comfort the students injured in the incident, regardless of the cause or faction of the injuries. (2) The councilor alumni will go to the respective schools in their personal capacity to investigate the truth. (3) Attitude towards arrested students: (1) Those who have been arrested and found not to have violated the law will be requested to be released by the military camp authorities. (2) Those who have been arrested for violating discipline will also be requested to be treated leniently by the authorities, warned, and released. (3) Those who have been arrested for being deemed to have overstepped boundaries will be requested by the military and police authorities to be handed over to the school principal or professors and parents to be taken back for supervision. (4) Tao Baichuan, Zhao Junhao, and Huang Shijin, three councilors, were appointed to draft a letter to students based on the opinions obtained from today's (29th) discussion, to be submitted for decision at the meeting on the 30th.

### Various Committees of the Council Separately Review Various Proposals; Resolved to Add More Than 78 Billion to Revenue and Expenditure Budget; Further Education Fees Maintained at Original Ratio, Cannot Be Collected from Students

[Our Dispatch] Yesterday was the fourth day of the third meeting of the Municipal Council. Various committees separately reviewed the proposals that had not been reviewed in the previous meeting. The Finance, Police, Public Utilities, Education, Social Affairs, and Autonomy committees met in the morning, and the Land Administration, Health, Public Works, Budget and Final Accounts, and Legal Affairs committees met in the afternoon. The resolutions of each committee were preliminary review opinions. The final resolution still needs to be submitted to the Assembly for discussion and determination. The main items are recorded separately below:

(3) The third additional budget should be incorporated into the original budget of the Health Bureau for unified management and distribution, and no additional amount should be added separately.

If the Municipal Council can handle this according to Article 90 of the Land Law, allowing landlords to legally increase rent, then this dispute can be resolved. Finally, Chairman Lu Shidao proposed a vote, and the case was transferred to the relevant motion regarding rent review for joint discussion in order to seek a thorough solution.

### China Aluminum Factory Resists Resumption of Production; Social Affairs Bureau to Suggest Government Takeover

[Our Newspaper] The Swiss Consul General visited Wu Kaixian, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, yesterday regarding the suspension dispute of the Swiss-owned China Aluminum Steel Refinement Factory. Director Wu stated that the factory's abrupt suspension was inappropriate. The Social Affairs Bureau can agree to the factory's proposal to dismiss one or two workers who caused the incident, but it is unreasonable to subsequently dismiss more than one hundred workers without cause. The Social Affairs Bureau has ordered the factory to resume production twice, but it has not complied. If the factory has any objections, it can apply for arbitration from the municipal government. Continuing to close the factory and disregard the workers is illegal. If workers go on strike without cause, wages may not be paid according to regulations. However, since the factory suddenly suspended operations without cause, workers' wages will be requested to be paid as usual.

Director Wu later told reporters that if either labor or management is dissatisfied with the mediation, they can apply for arbitration. If they neither comply with the mediation record nor apply for arbitration within the deadline, then one party can sue in court. The Social Affairs Bureau will also take appropriate action against labor or management who violate the law. Director Wu stated that if measures such as dissolution are taken, it would only cause panic among workers about job loss. Therefore, he will suggest to the central government that in such cases, the government should take over the factory, similar to the practice in the United States.

### Settlement Reached in British Tram Workers Mediation

### Price Hike of Public Utilities to Be Finally Decided at National Price Conference; Director Zhao Says Adjustment Necessary

[Our Newspaper] The issue of raising the prices of public utilities in the city has not yet been specifically decided. According to Mayor Wu after returning to Shanghai, whether or not to raise prices depends on the final decision of the National Price Conference to be held in Beijing tomorrow. Due to official duties in the city, Mayor Wu decided to send Wu Kaixian, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, and Zhao Zengjue, Director of the Public Utilities Bureau, to Beijing to attend the meeting, so that proper decisions can be made regarding rice prices and public utilities in the city.

Yesterday afternoon, reporters visited Zhao Zengjue, Director of the Public Utilities Bureau, to inquire about the plans he would bring to Beijing to solve the losses of public utilities in the city. According to Director Zhao, after the cost of living index was unfrozen, the losses of public utilities agencies will inevitably increase month by month, and the central government will not be able to bear the burden. If they reluctantly increase subsidies for the time being, there will inevitably be a day when they cannot afford it. If the prices of public utilities have to be adjusted, the multiple of the increase will be considerable, and its impact on citizens will also be significant. Therefore, Mayor Wu and Director Zhao both believe that the city's public utilities, compared with current prices, definitely need to be adjusted. According to Director Zhao, public utilities may be allowed to automatically adjust prices in the future, but they must be based on three factors: fuel (coal and gasoline), cost of living index, and foreign exchange. Public utilities agencies must submit the minimum cost when adjusting prices to the Public Utilities Bureau and forward it to the municipal government for approval. According to reporters' inquiries from relevant parties, although the multiples of the price adjustments that the city's public utilities agencies are currently requesting from the municipal government are not consistent, the average is at least around four or five times.

The fourth match against Qunxing was originally scheduled to be held on the 27th, but it rained heavily, which did not stop until the 28th, so it was impossible to compete. In order to fulfill the agreement with the Zheng Lun team, they tried to buy plane tickets yesterday, and five people flew first.

Yesterday, the team accepted the invitation of the Central Bank basketball team to play a friendly match, which was held at the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA gymnasium at 7:00 PM, with referee Chen Baolin.

The Shanghai Bank team is well-connected, has a tacit understanding, and has Wang Wanchun, Ling Kecheng, and Ju Fukun in the attack, and Xie Huaibang and Cheng Shining in the defense. The talents are average. Yesterday, the leader Wang Zongmou came to supervise the battle in person, and the morale was greatly boosted. The Central Bank is also a strong team in the silver and money industry, but because of its short stature and lack of confidence in shooting, it cannot cope and is in a following situation.

After the start of the game, Wang Wanchun, the captain of the Shanghai Bank, completed it in one breath, occupying an absolute advantage of nine to zero. Zhou Fukun then left the venue due to a foot injury, which was slightly relaxed, but the Shanghai Bank still controlled the situation. The first half was eighteen to five, and the Shanghai Bank won. In the second half, fresh troops were frequently transferred to the stage, which was slightly balanced, but Ling Kecheng of the Shanghai Bank dominated the world, and the Central Bank could not stop his activity, so the Shanghai Bank finally defeated the Central Bank by thirty to four.

### Acquisition of Spring Cocoon Factory Loans; More Than 120 Billion Yuan Have Been Allocated; 69 Have Signed Contracts with the Agricultural Bank

[This Newspaper News] According to the Chinese Farmers Bank, as of now, 69 manufacturers have signed contracts with the bank to acquire merchant loans, and the total number of purchases has reached 54,572 dan. Calculated at 3.5 million yuan per dan of fresh silkworm, plus 15 billion yuan of reserve funds for Yigan Silk Fengxun of various factories collected on behalf of the China Silk Corporation, the total amount of loans amounts to 206 billion yuan. The manufacturers signed contracts with China Morning Bank in a total of seven batches. The details of each time are as follows:

(Batch) (Number of Factories) (Purchase Amount)

Batch 1 29 36,761 dan

Batch 2 28 10,760 dan

Batch 3 3 1,344 dan

Batch 4 2 1,878 dan

Batch 5 3 1,536 dan

Batch 6 3 1,427 dan

Batch 7 1 866 dan

Total 69 54,572 dan

Furthermore, as of now, manufacturers in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces who have signed contracts have prepared all the necessary procedures and obtained loans, totaling 54 units. The actual amount of loans disbursed totals 121.3 billion yuan. It is learned that the reason why some manufacturers have not yet gone to collect loans is because they are still waiting to raise the one-tenth deposit of the loan amount, so there is some delay.

When the amount of cocoon collection by each manufacturer in Jiangsu and Zhejiang exceeds the approved quota, the excess amount will be purchased by the China Silk Corporation on its behalf. The purchase funds are allocated from another 15 billion yuan of the 200 billion yuan loan amount for use. Furthermore, the China Silk Corporation's cocoon collection funds of 2 billion yuan in the Anhui region are now feeling insufficient, and 500 million yuan has also been allocated from the 15 billion yuan of funds for use.

### Cash is Used for Cocoon Collection Everywhere

[Another News] Liu Gongyun, Deputy Governor of the Central Bank, met with reporters yesterday and answered many questions raised by reporters. The main points are summarized as follows: (1) The parallel line note has not been issued by our bank, and cash is used for all cocoon collection in Jiangsu and Zhejiang. (2) At present, the government is promoting the export of tea by purchasing last year's stored tea. For this year's new tea, loans will be adopted to assist in the production and sales of tea. As for the loan method, it is currently being submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval, and there will be specific regulations soon. (3) The main principle of the government's support for bulk export materials is to support the production and sales of export materials. In recent years, domestic and foreign market prices have failed to coordinate, and merchants will suffer losses when exporting, so they have requested the government to purchase and export them to compensate. After the government purchases them, the profits and losses shall be borne by the national treasury. However, the purchase has no controlling nature. Merchants can still do as they please if they can transport it themselves.

### People's Food Allocation Committee: Formation Possible Within the Next Week; Rice Market Firm Then Weak, Japonica and Indica Continue to Decline

[Our Reporter] The Municipal People's Food Allocation Committee is expected to be officially established within the next week. Wu Kaixian, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau and concurrent Chairman of the Committee, stated yesterday that after the draft of the committee's organization was prepared, it was originally scheduled to be submitted to the municipal meeting on the 30th for discussion. However, since the municipal meeting has been temporarily suspended, it has been submitted to Mayor Wu for review. It will be established first upon Mayor Wu's approval and then submitted to the municipal council for discussion. After the establishment of the committee, the existing Food Section under the Social Affairs Bureau will not be abolished. The allocation of rice to schools and factories will be transferred to the Allocation Committee for handling. The distribution of rice to the poor will not be implemented this month. The Social Affairs Bureau is scheduled to invite district chiefs and representatives of district residents on June 2nd to hold a meeting to discuss the matter. Letters have also been sent to various districts to inquire whether they are capable of handling the distribution of rice to the poor, in order to determine whether the municipal government or autonomous organizations should be responsible for it.

[Our Reporter] The rice market yesterday was initially firm but then weakened. After the opening, various trading groups had slightly better sales. Later, due to the limited arrival of japonica rice, there were inquiries, and the morning weather was cloudy with a hint of rain, leading to a strengthening of sentiment. Consequently, the japonica rice market rebounded by several thousand yuan. As for indica rice, due to the considerable release of holdings by holders, and the limited capacity of shops, the market was stable and maintained its original price. However, before the market closed, due to tight credit conditions and lack of purchasing power, the prices of both japonica and indica rice declined, with both northern and southern markets trending downwards. Yesterday, the registered arrivals at the market totaled 4,768 shih and 4 dou. High-quality white japonica was priced at 410,000 yuan, and thin paddy ranged from 400,000 yuan to 405,000 yuan.

Sufficient Supply of Rice, Wheat, and Cooking Oil

Mayor Wu recently returned to Shanghai on the 28th after being summoned to Beijing. It is understood that in addition to reporting on the student unrest in Shanghai, important instructions were received regarding the issue of commodity prices. In the future, concerning rice: (1) efforts will be made to ensure smooth transportation from the production areas to Shanghai; (2) the amount of rice allocated for sale will be increased from 180,000 shih to 300,000 shih starting next month. As for cooking oil: (1) the city will continue to purchase soybeans from the Northeast region to meet factory needs; (2) other organizations will be requested to purchase soybeans and other miscellaneous grains at reasonable market prices to avoid stimulating price increases in the production areas. Regarding wheat flour, due to a lack of rain in the production areas during the wheat season, this year's harvest may not be ideal. The city has already considered remedial measures for the future source of raw materials for wheat flour.

The price of wheat flour fluctuated up and down yesterday, and with the impending implementation of flour rationing, demand weakened, causing prices to fall back by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan. Bran trading was sluggish, and the situation was stable. Soybean cake initially rose and then stabilized, with prices increasing by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. The situation for soybeans became fixed.

The cooking oil market saw continuous arrivals from Qingdao, leading to a gradual decline in prices. Crude oil, soybean oil, refined oil, and rapeseed oil all saw a price drop of 10,000 yuan. Sesame oil was stable and weak. Mung beans continued to decline, falling to a further low of 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Sesame seeds were traded actively but not vigorously, with high prices being stable and secondary prices being weak. Raw peanuts stabilized after falling. There were few transactions for red sorghum, so it experienced little gain or loss for the time being. Corn digestion was also weak, without much fluctuation. Red beans stood firm.

Reviewing Standards for Rice Rationing Regulations

[Our Reporter] The Social Affairs and Education Bureaus have been reviewing the rice rationing work for factories and schools with great intensity in recent days. More than 200 public and private schools have been approved, and payment notices have been issued successively. As for factories, there are quite a few that do not meet the regulations. For the sake of speed, eligibility is limited to those holding a factory registration certificate with the character "Gong" issued by the Ministry of Economic Affairs and a temporary receipt for the industrial registration application with the character "Guan Gong" issued by the Social Affairs Bureau. All others holding company licenses with the characters "She" or "Xin," business registration certificates with the character "Shang," and temporary receipts for business registration applications with the character "Guan Shang" will not be reviewed and will be immediately rejected for rice rationing.

Furthermore, some labor unions in the city have recently notified factories not to include workers who are not members of the union in the rice rationing scheme and have requested instructions from the Social Affairs Bureau. The Social Affairs Bureau clarified yesterday: (1) Applications for rice rationing should be made by the factory as a unit, and all employees, including child laborers, can be included for rice certification. There is no provision that workers who are not members of the union are not entitled to rice rationing. (2) All factory employees must hold a national identity card. If they are still in the process of applying for one, they should submit a list of numbers when they receive them during the first rice collection. If they are unable to receive the identity card before the first rice collection, flexibility will be allowed. All approved rice rationing will be issued as usual, but an identity card is required for the second application.

[Another Dispatch] The Jianxin steamship, represented by the Hualun Foreign Firm, arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday from Bangkok, carrying 41,220 bags of rice. The unloading is currently underway. This Siamese rice was purchased by the China Trust Bureau. The Jianxin steamship was newly imported from the United States by the Yixiang Shipping Company and went to Siam to transport rice. Therefore, this is the ship's first arrival in Shanghai.

### Sugar Market Sentiment Improves

### Cigarette Sales Up, Prices Down

Yesterday, the cigarette market lacked energy because it was the end of the month, and firms were scrambling for funds. Selling was common in the market, and general hoarders, seeing the imminent approach of telegrams, were also offering more for sale. Furthermore, foreign group firms were also releasing their holdings, creating a situation of oversupply, and the market price frequently declined.

Great Britain brand cigarettes initially hovered around 6.67 million yuan, gradually decreasing to around 580,000 yuan. In the afternoon, there were some sporadic purchases, showing a slight rebound, and finally closed at 6.73 million yuan, an increase of 90,000 yuan.

Other Chinese and American brand cigarettes also saw prices fall more than rise due to the approaching telegram season and the reluctance of buyers to come forward.

### Outport Sales Agents Have Buying Intentions; Rayon Prices Called Firm; Spun Silk Is a Rare Commodity, Seeing Another Frenzied Increase

Yesterday, the rayon market saw a surge in prices as soon as it opened due to slight buying interest from outport sales agents. No. 120 Gaoshan bright rayon was first called at 18.1 million yuan, which was immediately traded, then rose in a straight line, with the highest bid exceeding 19 million yuan. However, due to buyers remaining on the sidelines, the price fell back, closing at 18.6 million yuan. There was not much trading in the afternoon. The final asking price was 18.7 million yuan, an increase of 1.2 million yuan from the previous day. Xintianqiao and Dongyang brands were called at 18.8 million yuan. No. 75 semi-bright rayon also saw an increase of 1 million yuan.

Yesterday, the spun silk market experienced another frenzied increase due to rumors that the price of improved silkworm cocoons in Zhejiang had increased to 1.4 million yuan, calculating the cost per dan to be 25 million yuan. Furthermore, market inventory was extremely low, and general holders considered it a rare commodity, unanimously driving up prices. In the morning, B-grade was bid at 25 million yuan, but a counteroffer of 4 million yuan did not result in a transaction. D-grade was bid at 24 million yuan, with the official transaction price at 23 million yuan. In the afternoon, a counteroffer of 4 million yuan still did not result in a sale. The bidding prices for other grades were all approximately 2 million yuan higher than the previous day, and the market situation was extremely chaotic, with very little trading. There was a five-dan lot with an inspection certificate, with a bid of 18 million yuan. Another lot was called at around 16 million yuan, but there were no official transactions.

Dachen checkered crepe initially traded at 31,200 yuan, then traded at 31,500 yuan in the middle of the day. Finally, the bid was 31,600 to 31,700 yuan. In the afternoon, the silk price was high, and the sentiment was even stronger, with sellers bidding 32,000 yuan. Huajin crepe officially traded at 14,000 yuan. The price of Shenghuo goods also increased by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan. Luofang was reported to be rising in Hangzhou, with Luojing priced at 11,000 yuan and Fang priced at 11,600 yuan, so the Shanghai market also rose sharply by 500 yuan yesterday.

### Market Rumors Abound, Chinese Stocks Trend Weak

Although the drop-period arbitrage on Chinese stocks was cheap yesterday, various unfavorable news for delivery continued to emerge, making it difficult to sustain the firm trend to the end. International rumors and public security rumors resurfaced, revealing instability near the close.

The morning opening saw increases, with Nos. 142, 97, 117, 68, 76, 65, 215, and 61 all advancing. Nos. 134 and 99 advanced for spot Wing On Yarns, which rose from 7,250 yuan to 7,400 yuan. Nos. 89 and 122 were strongly sold and slightly rebounded. China Textile alone reported a limit up. At this time, the drop-period premium was small, making it quite stable. However, after 10:10 AM, Nos. 71, 179, 12, 112, and 171 Wing On Yarns were sold to 7,250 yuan, and Nos. 122, 125, 94, 99, and 106 still advanced to 7,400 yuan. Nos. 226, 171, 193, 199, 155, 154, 160, and 232 came to sell, and many rumors unfavorable to delivery emerged, leading to a decline.

Nos. 231, 235, and 84 were resold to around 7,050 yuan. Nos. 224, 129, 77, 186, and 12 were cut at the close, forcing the drop-period Wing On Yarns down to 6,920 yuan. Nos. 142 and 157 advanced slightly, struggling to close at around 6,950 yuan. The after-market was peaceful. As a result, compared to the previous closing, Xinguang, Xinhua, and Wing On Public were flat. Wing On Yarn, Sino-French, and Wah Fung Ching Fook declined slightly. China Textile, a miscellaneous stock, had a limit up and then rebounded, increasing by slightly over 10%. Underwear fell by slightly less than 10%, domestic goods by slightly less than half a percent, matches and commercial flat, Rong Feng, Tong Yi, Li An, and Cement rose slightly, and the rest declined slightly. Among the stocks for delivery, Xinguang alone increased by half a percent, Wing On Yarn increased by slightly less than half a percent, Sino-French and Qunxing increased slightly, and Wing On Public and Ching Fook declined slightly. The increases and decreases of the old stocks outside the market were all slight.

The spot-drop period trading yesterday saw fewer longs, leading to crowded floating positions. Financial firms also frequently engaged in arbitrage, and the interest rate decreased from 2.5 jiao to 1.5 jiao, finally around 1.7 to 1.8 fen. The Wing On Yarn premium decreased from 450 yuan to below 320 yuan, finally around 330 to 350 yuan, due to the successive advances of Nos. 165, 45, 201, 97, 106, 137, 147, 185, 220, 231, 215, and 49. Small-cap stocks also decreased from 11 or 12 yuan to within 9 yuan.

### Customer Firms Frequently Show Buying Interest; Yarn Prices Up From Previous Day; Various Grades of Cotton Cloth Also Showed Improvement of Several Thousand Yuan

Yesterday, the yarn market initially opened flat, but then Tianjin and Guangdong firms, which had been quiet for a long time, showed signs of activity, and their buying intentions strengthened. Manufacturers in various locations along the Beijing-Hangzhou railway were actively buying, leading to rising asking prices. The opening price for 42-count Blue Phoenix yarn was 12.2 million yuan, an increase of 150,000 yuan from the previous day. 20-count special double horse yarn was 7.55 million yuan, double horse yarn was 7.05 million yuan, and 16-count Guangming silk was 5.65 million yuan, all up from 140,000 to 250,000 yuan. The prices of other counts of yarn also increased by 30,000 to 50,000 yuan.

Yesterday, the cotton cloth market saw scattered holders selling due to the approaching end of the period and tight credit conditions. Longtou fine cloth once fell to 295,000 or 296,000 yuan. Later, hearing that yarn prices had rebounded, local dyeing factories and customers from Tianjin and Hankou seized the opportunity to buy on the dips. Until the end, the price of 12-pound Longtou fine cloth rebounded to 300,700 yuan, an increase of 9,000 yuan from the previous day. Five Fortune Blue Chicken, color ball and other fine cloths also increased by about 5,000 to 7,000 yuan. The prices of other materials such as serge, Zhigong silk, bleached cloth, raw cloth, colored cloth, and coarse cloth all rose by approximately 2,000 to 3,000 yuan to over 10,000 yuan.

### Foreign Exchange Review Committee Decides to Expand Scope of Work

[Our Reporter] It is reported that the Foreign Exchange Review Committee, established by the Executive Yuan, aims to standardize foreign exchange reviews. The original scope of work was to review the foreign exchange required by various government agencies. It has now been decided to expand to include the review of general foreign exchange. Therefore, the committee's structure will include three sub-committees, each responsible for reviewing: (1) foreign exchange for agencies, (2) foreign exchange for imports, and (3) foreign exchange required by individuals. It is reported that the review procedures are awaiting approval from the Executive Yuan. Once approved, they will be implemented.

The committee members include: Minister of Finance Yu Hongjun, Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan Gan Naiguang, Chief Accountant of the National Government Xu Kan, Minister of Audit Lin Yunhai, and Governor of the Central Bank Zhang Jiazhi, with the Minister of Finance serving as the chairman of the committee.

### Caustic Soda Market Price Declines

Yesterday, the market for raw materials for soap and candles was stable due to the balance between supply and demand. However, there was a glut of spot goods for Yuet Pi brand caustic soda, with prices called at 7.1 million yuan per barrel, a decrease of 150,000 yuan from the previous day. American caustic soda also showed a weak trend, priced at 6.95 million yuan, also down slightly by 50,000 yuan from yesterday. The markets for other materials such as soda ash, coconut oil, and white wax were stable.

### Soap and Matches Lack Vitality

Yesterday, among the daily necessities, Wong Cheung Mau soap fell from around 260,000 yuan to 255,000 yuan before someone was willing to buy. However, there were very few transactions. Then, those who had previously sold short came to replenish their positions, leading to a situation where the price initially dropped and then immediately rose. Finally, the price was 262,000 yuan, only slightly better by 1,000 yuan. Gu Ben and Jian Dao fell by 9,000 to 5,000 yuan. The markets for other Guanghua, Sunlight, Sun-Moon and other brands of soap and matches were all sluggish due to tight credit conditions at the end of the month.

### Jiaozuo Lump Coal Price Continues to Fall

Since the price of bituminous coal was bid high, actual sales have been slow. However, there has also not been much supply, so the market situation has been hovering, slightly weak. The Jiaozuo lump white coal that arrived was handled by outsiders, making it difficult to sell immediately, so the market price was praised to fall. Due to the news of increased freight rates next month, which greatly affected costs, the coal briquette factories have been absorbing a lot of Yuanhua white coal dust recently.

### Sichuan Pickled Mustard Tuber Rebounds

Sichuan pickled mustard tuber previously declined due to slow sales, with ordinary goods only at 260,000 or 270,000 yuan. Recently, with summer sales picking up, it has become tight, with high-quality goods reaching 400,000 yuan and ordinary goods at 310,000 or 320,000 yuan.

### National Bank Dispatches Personnel to Hong Kong to Discuss Preventing Smuggling; Large Number of Smuggled Imports, Exports, and Remittances

[Our Reporter] Recently, due to the increasingly serious problem of smuggling to and from Hong Kong, the government, in order to discuss how to prevent or reduce the severity of smuggling, has specially dispatched Shao Zenghua, Deputy Director of the Business Bureau of the Central Bank, British legal advisor Rogers, and Shen Xihong, Executive Committee member of the Export Promotion Committee, to Hong Kong to jointly discuss appropriate solutions with the relevant authorities there. Shao and his party flew to Hong Kong yesterday. They are expected to stay in Hong Kong and Guangzhou for a week to ten days before returning to Shanghai.

According to relevant sources, the severity of smuggling in Hong Kong is threefold: (1) Export smuggling: For example, large quantities of tung oil are smuggled out, using the black market foreign exchange in Hong Kong, still yielding substantial profits. (2) Import smuggling: Imported goods that cannot be approved for import into the country often pass through Hong Kong as a distribution and transshipment point. (3) Overseas remittance smuggling: Due to the excessively large difference between the official exchange rate and the black market exchange rate, many overseas remittances are routed through Hong Kong. Although there are no precise estimates for the amount of smuggling in the above three categories, the amount must be extremely large. They stated that Hong Kong's economy is closely related to China's mainland economy, and it cannot stand idly by and ignore the deterioration of smuggling. Therefore, they sincerely hope that this trip can achieve a satisfactory solution.

### Bao Da Bank Declares Liquidation

[Our Reporter] Bao Da Bank, located at the corner of Nanjing Road and Jiangxi Road in the city, suddenly appointed lawyer Zhang Naizuo yesterday to announce liquidation. According to its liquidation announcement, it stated that it had recently been unable to continue operating due to the government's implementation of emergency economic measures and the unbearable pressure of high-interest loans, and had no choice but to declare liquidation. It also hopes that all debtors will bring funds to Zhang's law firm within seven days to repay their debts. All creditors are also requested to bring their credentials to register within the aforementioned period. It is reported that the bank is a partnership, managed by Chen Shaobo, and was reorganized and established last year, mainly engaged in general currency exchange business. This time, the losses amounted to 1.2 billion yuan, mostly from relatives and friends. The amount of registered creditors who came yesterday was less than 10 million yuan. Furthermore, Tianyu Securities, broker No. 192 of the Stock Exchange, also rented a portion of the bank's premises to operate a medicine market. Due to Bao Da's liquidation, it also hurriedly moved out a few days ago.

### Purchase of Foreign Sales Peanuts; All Ports Release in Batches

The Executive Committee of the Export Promotion Committee held a meeting yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, presided over by Director Chen Guangfu, to discuss various cases as follows: (1) The principle of facilitating funding for the import of raw materials to manufacture export goods was resolved and passed, and will be sent to the Central Bank and other banks to discuss implementation procedures. (2) The International Emergency Food Committee has determined that China will export 1,000 tons of peanut oil this year, equivalent to approximately 2,240 tons of peanuts. Our country's exports this year have already exceeded the quota, so the customs has been ordered to temporarily prohibit exports, and all foreign sales of peanuts will be stopped. However, the peanuts purchased by the United Kingdom, France, the United States, and other countries at various ports in our country were all released to those countries before the customs ban. The prolonged delay in transportation may cause deterioration. It has been decided to first select peanuts at various ports in the production areas awaiting ships for foreign sales, and release them in batches, followed by Shanghai, in order to increase the country's foreign exchange income, fulfill foreign contracts, and avoid stimulating the city's oil supply. (3) The Executive Committee has now stipulated that regular meetings will be held at the Central Bank every Wednesday.

### Customs Notice on Amendments to Regulations Governing Customs Brokers

The Jianghai Customs issued a notice yesterday stating: "Upon investigation, the Regulations Governing Customs Brokers, previously amended by the Ministry of Finance and submitted to the Customs, were announced in Notice No. 111. Now, Article 5, Paragraph 3 of the above-mentioned amended regulations has been amended and promulgated by the Ministry of Finance and transmitted to the Customs. Hereby, the amended provision is copied and announced for public information." The copied amended provision of Article 5, Paragraph 3 of the Regulations Governing Customs Brokers is as follows: "If the applicant for a guarantee deposit from the local legal customs broker association is a member of the local legal customs broker association, the association may issue a guarantee as collateral. However, the association shall pay according to the number of members, with each member's guarantee deposit ranging from 200,000 to 1,000,000 national currency units, as the association's guarantee, the amount of which shall be determined by the Customs Commissioner of each Customs."

### Zhang Weiru Represents to Attend the World Trade Conference

[Our Reporter] The China Import and Export Trade Association held a symposium yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, attended by over 30 people from the city's import and export trade community, chaired by Qiu Liangrong, Secretary-General of the Association. During the meeting, Zhang Weiru, the representative of our country attending the World Trade and Employment Conference and the current technical official of the Commodity Inspection Bureau of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, was introduced. Zhang is scheduled to fly to Europe next week. Before leaving the country, he intends to solicit opinions from people in various industries for reference.

Yesterday's fir wood market price rebounded slightly due to the arrival of incoming goods. The market atmosphere was flat and weak.

New Medicine and New Drugs

### Further Discussion on Calcium Gluconate

— Shen Songnian

My humble article, "Calcium Gluconate," originally intended as a means of eliciting valuable opinions, has unexpectedly garnered attention from advanced thinkers, wise individuals, and authoritative scholars since its publication in the tenth issue of this journal. I am deeply honored. I am profoundly grateful to Mr. Wu Guocheng for using experiments to clarify the truth in the thirteenth issue. I am especially thankful for the guidance from Mr. Wang Qizhang, a senior figure in the medical community, in the fifteenth issue!

Calcium deficiency inevitably leads to tuberculosis, and tuberculous lesions consume large amounts of calcium. Therefore, tuberculosis is always accompanied by calcium deficiency, creating a reciprocal cause-and-effect relationship. This is the primary reason why tuberculosis patients need a large calcium supplement. Even if a special medicine for tuberculosis is invented in the future, perhaps a considerable calcium supplement will still be necessary, but perhaps not long-term injections. Once the lesions are healed, calcium can be supplemented again, just as injecting a sufficient amount of calcium after any major illness can help the body recover quickly. After any major illness, the lungs are inevitably weak. Injecting calcium can not only strengthen the lungs but also fortify the muscles and nerves. Therefore, calcium can also treat debilitated patients. As such, children with rickets, lung patients, and pregnant women indeed need large amounts of calcium. All weak individuals, especially children whose development is incomplete, need even more supplementation. Mr. Wang sympathizes with Mr. Song Guobin's assertion that "the elderly and those with syphilis do not need much calcium." If elderly patients with pulmonary tuberculosis are in the active stage, it is appropriate to weigh the urgency and give priority to the immediate need. If calcium is needed, it should be used immediately. Before more advanced drugs are discovered, there is certainly no time to consider the "induction of other diseases." Given that patients urgently need calcium, even if they are elderly, what can be done if the disease increases without supplementation? Under these circumstances, "inducing other diseases" is only a secondary problem, especially since it is not certain that it will induce other diseases. Calcium is ultimately not a potent drug. Mr. Wang also tells us that "excess calcium can be naturally excreted from the body," so there is naturally no harm from accumulation. If older people do not inject calcium, their blood vessels will still harden. If calcium is not needed, there is naturally no need for injections. As for syphilitic hemoptysis, diagnoses without blood tests are mostly mistaken for tuberculosis. Injecting calcium is naturally harmful and unhelpful, and will lead to misdiagnosis and delays.

For patients with pulmonary tuberculosis, oral calcium intake naturally does not have much effect. Mr. Wang believes that "once calcium passes through the digestive system, it undergoes complex changes," but this seems debatable. Before injectable calcium was invented, was tuberculosis also cured? If oral calcium intake is not suitable, as it is said to cause "complex changes," then oral calcium supplements should be naturally eliminated altogether? In fact, oral calcium supplements do have their own considerable effects. Otherwise, health experts in various advanced countries would not advocate supplementing calcium through diet. According to literature, there were also examples of using oral calcium to cure lung diseases in ancient China. A passage from the "Baji" (containing calcium) section of the herbal classic is copied below:

"A government official in Taizhou pitied a heavily sentenced prisoner. The prisoner was touched and said, 'I have committed seven capital crimes and suffered lung damage from torture. I obtained a prescription for "Baji" powder, which I took daily with miraculous effect.' Later, the prisoner was subjected to slow slicing. When his chest was opened, dozens of holes were seen in his lungs, all filled with "Baji," the color of which remained unchanged."

This passage probably isn't made up? It can be proven by experiments. Then it is clear that the decomposition and denaturation of calcium in the stomach and intestines is indeed different from the decomposition and denaturation in intravenous blood. However, it is all beneficial to tuberculosis, but oral administration has a weaker and slower effect. Intravenous injection is actually not ideal. In the near future, perhaps there will be an invention for direct injection into lung lesions, which would be the real goal. Clinically, calcium is used to treat cutaneous tuberculosis, often with miraculous results. It is believed that direct injection into lung lesions would certainly have unexpected results, but direct injection into the lungs could cause irritation, which is, of course, still a problem.

Lesions naturally need insoluble calcium. Mr. Wang believes that "to allow calcium to easily enter the bloodstream for transport and avoid thrombosis," it is necessary to "combine it with various acid radicals to form soluble calcium" to reach the destination – the lesion – where it "remains an insoluble calcium mass." However, in fact, this may not be the case, because calcium without various acid radicals can still flow freely in the blood without causing thrombosis, just as the editor stated in the comments added to my humble article: "The human body has its own 'controlling' function in controlling and regulating acids and calcium." Therefore, both soluble and insoluble calcium are beneficial for tuberculosis, just as fructose and glucose, and eating starch, can still become nutrients. Although it is reasonable to combine "calcium gluconate and vitamin C" for use, some people with unique constitutions occasionally have reactions when using them together. Whether used together or separately, such as "calcium" injected intravenously and "C" injected intramuscularly, there are similar reactions. Therefore, for these special patients, I do not advocate using them together; it is better to alternate them every other day. Perhaps Mr. Song Guobin's disapproval of using them together, and his vehement criticism of vitamin C, stems from experiencing the suffering of special patients?

For all fevers caused by toxins secreted by tuberculosis bacteria, in the absence of other causes, calcium can be used to reduce fever. General antipyretics are not a fundamental solution; calcium is the real antipyretic for tuberculosis fever.

Mr. Wang's thirty years of experience, combined with chemical research, has revealed that "regardless of the type of calcium, when injected into the body, it undergoes several stages of acidification as it passes through various tissues, abandoning its original acid radicals and combining with carbonic acid to form insoluble calcium carbonate masses." This truth has been further advanced and revealed to the world, showing that calcium is injected into the body with the sole purpose of "fear of not acidifying and not causing a chemical reaction." I respectfully ask Mr. Song for his opinion from the standpoint of academic inquiry.

In conclusion, in my humble opinion, the discussion on the combined use of calcium gluconate and ascorbic acid is nothing more than old news, and there is nothing particularly insightful about it. The suspicion of Mr. Song's review is also a common feeling among most doctors in the world.

### Reflections on the Revision of Middle School Health Education Materials

— Yu Zhengxing

—A Call to Emphasize School Health Education—

Recently, the Ministry of Education convened a middle school curriculum conference to revise the middle school curriculum standards. This measure aligns with the background of the times and is being carried out to coordinate with the course of national construction. The current content of the health curriculum is dry and uninteresting and will be completely overturned, and new standards will be formulated separately. This is indeed worthy of earnest expectations.

The great educator E.G. Bonser said: "I believe that life, health, and education share the same goal, which is growth and the enrichment of experience." Originally, life is education, teaching people how to live? Teaching people how to live healthily? Of course, it is the primary goal, and there is nothing more important in the world than healthy living. Therefore, the revision of the middle school physiology and hygiene curriculum is necessary. Similarly, strengthening middle school students' health education and maintaining their healthy lives to increase educational effectiveness is even more necessary.

Currently, the poor academic performance of general students is attributed by some to students' lack of learning spirit, carelessness, perfunctoriness, and a tendency to take shortcuts. They also accuse students of not respecting teachers and valuing the Dao. From an educational standpoint, we believe that this view is not without its merits, but unfortunately, it only addresses the symptoms without tracing back to the causes, completely ignoring the students' health problems. Honestly speaking: Today's students are overloaded transformers. The heat converted from the nutrients they absorb is less than the kinetic energy they consume every day. Supplying the nutrients needed for four hours and expecting them to work for eight hours is impossible. It's like "eating green grass and squeezing out milk." They cannot maintain normal physical development, nor can they compensate for the necessary consumption. How can they have a high working ability? It's like "wanting the horse to run fast but not wanting it to eat grass," an impossible reality. Asking a patchwork, worn-out machine to have good working efficiency is a fantasy. Ignoring lifelong health and expecting students to have academic achievements is also impossible.

Today, many people think of schools as places to impart knowledge, invisibly treating education as a commodity, and even openly or secretly engaging in transactional practices, caring for nothing but the sale of knowledge. This is an unforgivable mistake. If you think that educational bankruptcy has nothing to do with students' health, you will naturally be unable to understand that health education is related to the success or failure of education. Neglecting school health education is at least one of the main factors in today's educational failures. Because education is life, it is the sum of using life experiences to adapt to life, and the main elements of life are clothing, food, housing, and transportation. However, all four of these are fulfilled through health. Because health includes the entirety of life, making individuals suitable for living and suitable for serving, it is said that: health is a function, it is the result of life, and it is not the purpose itself. Therefore, J.F. Williams of Columbia University said: "Health may be defined as quality of life that renders the individual fit to live most to serve best." Therefore, health education must be implemented in today's schools, and the purpose of school health education should be to maintain and enhance the health of both the educators and the educated. This is not just about treating or examining diseases, but about how to actively promote physical and mental health. However, what school administrators call "health education" often refers to medical services within the school. This shows a failure to clearly understand the true meaning of health education. School health and school health education are also often confused. Some even include all health services in the school within health education, and some regard health education and physical education as the same thing. What is the meaning of narrowing the concept of health education? Opinions also differ. Some say that health education only includes school health courses, but this fails to understand the true meaning of health education.

School health education is an organized activity and facility with the aim of cultivating habits, attitudes, and knowledge regarding the health conditions of all aspects of human physical, mental, and emotional well-being. Therefore, the activities and facilities of school health education must be continuous, conducted at different levels, and progress together with the ever-changing advancements of science. Its purpose is not only to pay attention to physical health but also to consider mental and emotional health, not only to impart knowledge but also to pay attention to the cultivation of both attitudes and habits. Modern health educators believe that health education should take behavior as the main goal, with knowledge secondary. We certainly hope that each individual can maintain their healthy behaviors and solve health problems. We must also teach them various health knowledge and cultivate important habits, behaviors, and attitudes.

Since the French government passed regulations in 1833 regarding school authorities' responsibilities for school health, until 1924 when 35 states in the United States stipulated considerable laws for school medical equipment and health training, countries around the world have strongly promoted school health education, especially the United States, which actively promotes school health education and regards it as a duty to be fulfilled by those responsible for education. In China, school health started earliest in Beiping, where the First Health Office and Xiehe Medical College jointly operated school health services. Later, major ports such as Guangzhou, Shanghai, and Nanjing also successively handled school health. In the 18th year of the Republic of China (1929), the national government promulgated the School Health Implementation Plan, and the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Education organized a School Health Committee. Various provinces successively established health education offices, county public education instructors, etc., with Jiangsu achieving the most significant results. After the War of Resistance, the Central Health Experimental Institute held school health education events in Shapingba, but they all focused more on school health rather than comprehensive school health education. In August of the year before last, the Central Design Bureau, the Ministry of Education, and the Department of Health jointly invited health education experts to formulate a national school health education promotion plan. In September of the same year, the Educational United Annual Meeting also passed a five-year plan to implement health education and entrusted it to the Ministry of Education for implementation. To this day, the plan remains a plan, and the project remains a project, with not even a fraction seen in reality. We are not without regret!

The middle school curriculum conference decided to reorganize health education materials, which is certainly a major reform in educational administration and policy. How to teach people to live healthily? Of course, it is the main concern of education officials in the future. Therefore, attention should be paid to those habits that can promote psychological effectiveness and behaviors that promote physical health, and more attention should be paid to the actual exploration of physical and mental health. Habits and healthy behaviors are also very important in current Chinese middle schools. We want to enable them to establish reasonable health behaviors based on hygiene principles and personal abilities.

Now school education is being reorganized and refreshed, and there will certainly be brilliant consequences in the future, but we still say sensitively: "Don't model the education of the student era after today's education." The times are evolving. May the education sector have a great awakening. In the future, "the first task of education is to enable students to obtain health." Schools should use educational methods to cultivate students' correct health concepts, mold proper health behaviors, to increase educational effectiveness, and use modern scientific medical equipment to prevent student diseases, protect student health, make the school environment fully meet hygiene conditions, and ensure that the lives of all school staff and students have health protection. This would be perfect!

### On Medicine and Hygiene

— Luo Xiangwen

My country's medical and health undertakings have made slight progress in the past two decades. But when you talk about it, it really feels pathetic. In the past, I have never seen a complete plan; even if there was a plan, I have not seen it implemented. What's more, there is a lack of funds, a lack of talent, and no one to advocate for it. Especially during the Anti-Japanese War, everything was based on military affairs as a prerequisite. More important departments and things to be done were not established. There was no financial or human resources to handle medical and health administration affairs. Affected by the wartime environment, it has been delayed until today.

It has been two years since the victory; there are thousands of things waiting to be done. However, due to the prolongation of the civil war, everything is still affected and cannot be improved or handled; how can we pay attention to the improvement and construction of medical and health administration.

Recently, the government reorganized and established the Ministry of Health; the Chinese Medical Association held its seventh conference in Nanjing; and the health authorities in this city registered medical personnel; these are all good news for the health protection of our nation. Although we are listed as one of the major powers, the increase in mortality rate; the backwardness of public health; I am afraid that we still occupy the first seat in the world. I believe that the people in charge of investigation and statistics in the health authorities will not deny it either.

Based on the above simple reasons; we hope that the following points can attract the attention and improvement of the health authorities; or thoroughly plan and implement them; in order to achieve good results.

(1) A complete health administration plan, I think the authorities have already formulated it, no need to say more. We only hope how to protect the health of the nation and gradually reduce the mortality rate. That is to say, how can we improve the level of public health enjoyment. Especially how to instill common sense in the people and how to promote, how to improve and other issues. If there is funding, talent, and a plan, we hope to be able to do it thoroughly. Formal paper talk, even if there is funding, talent, and a good plan, if you don't do it, it will not be effective. We want to appeal for the future of the Chinese nation!

(2) Most of the existing medical personnel in our country are developing individual businesses. Because the public medical system has not been implemented, there are too many abuses. This has created a situation where rich people can hire doctors and buy medicine; poor people can only dream of it. Taking Shanghai as an example, I don't know how many people are licensed to practice medicine. If the government has a plan and organization. The harvest during the Anti-Japanese War was already considerable, no need for us to discuss it again. It is not too late to start from this now. Compile and organize medical personnel across the country, popularize and distribute them to the whole country, and penetrate into the countryside. After ten or twenty years, the health of the nation will be guaranteed. Public health can be developed and the mortality rate can be reduced, can't it be predicted?

(3) The method of examination for medical personnel held by the health authorities in this city is good. However, we can predict that the results of the examination will not be good. Because: there are big problems with the examination method. If you don't pay attention to the examinee's academic qualifications, years of service, and clinical experience. And only pay attention to the answers on the test paper; it is tantamount to ignoring the examinee's real talents, which is unfair. For example, if you pass the test very well, you often have less practical experience. Or if you have served for many years, the test paper may not be impressive; this is a definite phenomenon. If you ask a doctor who is officially practicing now to take the test again, where will he be able to completely pass the test in essence. These factual problems need to be studied.

(4) We believe that those who have several years of service experience and considerable academic qualifications in the country now should be allowed to continue to practice medicine. The authorities should have a broader vision. There are surplus medical personnel in Shanghai; but the cities and villages across the country are pitiful. Just look at the counties and towns along the Yangtze River with relatively developed transportation, the medical equipment is simple and the lack of personnel is already worrying. Other hinterlands are even more unimaginable. Why don't the authorities thoroughly allocate them? Even nurses who came from Shanghai, if they leave Shanghai, based on what they have seen and heard, I believe they can also take on the medical care of a county or village; the guarantee of people's health. At least better than the so-called quacks selling herbal medicine and treating diseases. Wouldn't it be better to conscript and arrange them than to ban them?

The above points are all written in a random manner. We support the authorities to have a plan, have talent, and be able to do it effectively. To ensure the health of the people; to gradually develop medicine and health; to improve public health day by day; to popularize medical personnel across the country; these are all extremely important and should be done. For the future of the Chinese nation; for the health of future generations, we should support the government to advocate and handle it!

### Infant Nutrition

Making cabbage juice or various green vegetable juices: Wash the vegetable leaves, chop them, add one bowl of water to two bowls of vegetables, put them in a pot, cover tightly, boil for five minutes, remove from heat and soak in the pot for half an hour, filter out the dregs, and it's ready.

(B) Cod liver oil: Infants can be fed cod liver oil after one month to supplement the lack of vitamin D in the milk. In the first week, take half a teaspoon every day, and after a week, take it twice a day, half a teaspoon each time. After another one or two weeks, take it twice a day, one teaspoon each time, and then maintain this amount. If infants are sunbathing in the summer after four months, their bodies can produce vitamin D, so the amount of cod liver oil can be temporarily reduced.

(C) Egg yolk, green vegetables, etc.: When infants are four or five months old, cooked egg yolk can be added to supplement the lack of iron in the milk. Start with about one-eighth, and gradually increase it. Later, both the yolk and white can be used. If infants are premature, the amount of iron absorbed during the fetal period is less than that of ordinary infants. They should eat liver soup (how to make liver soup - three ounces of liver plus ten ounces of water, simmer over low heat for thirty minutes. Turn off the heat immediately after boiling, pass through a sieve and use it.) and other foods rich in iron within one or two months. From the fifth month, you can add green vegetable puree twice a day to provide iron and other minerals, vitamins, etc., which also helps with excretion. Start feeding with one tablespoon, and gradually increase to four tablespoons.

How to make vegetable puree: Wash leafy vegetables, chop them, add a little water, cook until soft, rub them through a clean wire screen, and remove the dregs. The remaining is the vegetable puree.

(A) Cereal foods: Infants have no ability to digest starch at birth. The carbohydrates needed by the body are supplied by lactose in the milk. Saliva and intestinal fluids gradually develop enzymes that digest starch. At four months, you can give porridge that has been filtered, twice a day, one tablespoon each time, and gradually increase it. By seven months, you can eat four tablespoons each time. When infants first start teething, add a piece of toasted bread or biscuits to exercise the gums.

(E) Others (minced meat, minced liver, tofu, etc.): From the sixth month onwards, you can feed cooked and mashed fruits (bananas do not need to be cooked) every day, gradually increasing from two tablespoons to one whole, to provide vitamins, inorganic salts, and tissue maintenance. Most European and American countries start weaning at eight or nine months and can completely wean by ten or eleven months. If it is a hot summer, it is often delayed until the autumn. China can be delayed until after one year old due to the lack of milk. Gradual weaning methods should be used. First, use milk or other milk substitutes or supplementary foods to replace one breastfeed. Reduce it again after a week, and reduce it in turn until it is completely weaned. Sometimes, due to special circumstances, it is necessary to wean completely in a short period. On the first day, milk can be used to replace one time, and on the second day, milk can be used to replace two times. Replace them in turn until they are completely weaned. Sometimes, if you have to wean immediately, if the infant is under five or six months old, it is best to hire a wet nurse. Otherwise, use formulated milk. Initially, the milk content should be small and the amount of water should be large. Later, the milk component is gradually concentrated. By the tenth day, the milk should be increased to the proper component. (To be continued)

Spring and Autumn

### Apple Green Handkerchief

— Gu Zhongliu

Hei Ni mended the cotton wadding that had been torn by the jujube tree, sewing a few stitches. Just as she was about to stick the needle into the thread board, her mother returned.

"Hurry up! I don't feel well..." Hei Ni's mother was shivering all over, her lips dark purple. "Your brother is waiting at the north end of the station!"

"Coming!" Hei Ni stood up, stepped forward to help her mother to the bed, and after her mother lay down, she covered her with the tattered coarse cloth quilt. Then, she hurriedly left the small earthen house, wrapped tightly against the cold wind, and walked towards the station.

The weather was indeed cold. The wind scraped Hei Ni's face like a knife, her teeth chattering crisply. Her nose was constantly running, and after wiping it once with her hand, it would drip again in no time.

As Hei Ni approached the station, a group of elementary school students returning home from school walked towards her. Some wore bright sweaters, others wore black overcoats, all looking lively and cheerful, like spirits of spring.

Hei Ni often encountered these elementary school students. Hei Ni often picked up coal cinders near the station.

When the elementary school students saw how frozen Hei Ni looked, a little girl in a red sweater blurted out a mocking rhyme:

"Little Hei Ni,

Nose running free,

No handkerchief, alas, to wipe it, see..."

Hei Ni pretended not to hear, lowered her head and walked on, trying her best to stop the mucus from flowing, but it just kept running...

Making Hei Ni almost cry.

Hei Ni had firmly said in her heart: "I will never go to the station again, even if I die!"

But, in order to eat, Hei Ni had to bite the bullet and still often went back to the station to pick up the exhaust from the train engines.

Spring has arrived. The ice on the small river has melted. The ground is soft and yielding... Hei Ni's nose no longer runs. Hei Ni, coming and going at the station, no longer looks worried and sad. Her head is held high, and her round eyes gleam with light. A beautiful smile blossoms petal by petal. An indescribable joy fills Hei Ni's heart.

This day, Hei Ni and her brother picked up a full basket and a full torn cloth bag of coal cinders next to the train engine spewing thick smoke. Her brother told her to take the basket of coal cinders home first. Hei Ni stayed by the railway for a while, then lifted the heavy basket and walked home. Sweat poured down her face. The happy Hei Ni didn't realize how unattractive her face, covered with coal dust, must look. But because of the warming weather, and because of the beads of sweat dripping down, a fantasy grew in her heart, a dream of getting a handkerchief.

"If I only had a piece of cloth to wipe my sweat, I would be happy!" Hei Ni said to herself. "Little Hei Ni, no shame, face unwashed, ugly, ugly!"

Suddenly, the mocking sound that Hei Ni was so familiar with and hated rang out again, ruthlessly thrown at Hei Ni...

Hei Ni took off the tattered cotton wadding she was wearing. The sun was getting warmer and warmer. Although it was only March, it already felt like early summer.

In the dazzling sunlight, Hei Ni walked towards the station. Her hands were no longer tucked into her sleeves, swinging back and forth, but walking with hops and skips, more lively than in winter; one could hardly recognize her as the same child.

Looking at a tender sprout breaking through the earth here, looking at a patch of green grass growing in the spring breeze there, Hei Ni was walking on a small path to the station when suddenly an apple-green handkerchief appeared before Hei Ni—a poor little girl who longed to have a handkerchief. Hei Ni suddenly stopped and stared blankly; she couldn't believe her eyes.

"Is this real?" A pile of question marks jumped in Hei Ni's mind.

She looked around. There was no one around. So, like a thief for the first time, Hei Ni excitedly bent down and picked up the handkerchief, hurriedly stuffing it into her pocket. Hei Ni glanced around again. This time she still didn't see anyone, and she calmed down a little.

But how short-lived were peace and joy for Hei Ni! Hei Ni's mind started working: she recalled her fantasy, the fantasy of getting a handkerchief did exist, but she had never once thought that the handkerchief that would belong to her in the future would be picked up from the road. She recalled the tragic scene of a pickpocket being caught and beaten during a village temple fair...

Hei Ni thought as she walked. The more she thought, the more she felt that she shouldn't have picked up this handkerchief. The handkerchief in her pocket felt as heavy as a stone, making Hei Ni uncomfortable; like being pricked by needles, her heart ached. Hei Ni suddenly felt that not having a handkerchief to wipe her nose or sweat was not embarrassing, but picking up someone else's lost handkerchief was truly embarrassing! If others saw her using it, they would definitely say she stole it!

So, Hei Ni took out the apple-green handkerchief and raised her hand high, shaking it above her head.

"Whose handkerchief? Whose lost handkerchief?" Hei Ni shouted loudly.

A man wearing an old bowler hat tilted to one side walked over, smiled coldly, and revealed two gold teeth. This gold-toothed man reached out and snatched the handkerchief away, ignoring Hei Ni, and walked towards the station.

Although Hei Ni suspected that this apple-green handkerchief was dropped by this annoying fellow, when the handkerchief fell from her hand into another person's hand, like a dog in the distance avoiding barking at the poor, she felt truly at peace in her heart.

### Rambling Weeds, Six Quatrains Expressing Sentiments

— Ruo Nan

Thirty years of floating on the sea, my body is light, drifting to the ends of the earth, a sorrowful traveler's feelings; everywhere the passes and mountains are impassable, the proud bones of poetry and books have ruined my life.

My nature is unconstrained and my spirit is bold, I deeply pity the world's current that is surging and vast; who knows me begging for food by the river tide? I entrust a handful of sorrow to the Songs of Chu.

My life is like a tumbleweed, old age in a high hall with white hair; the night watch is exhausted, the residual lamp extinguished, my heart a thousand times weeping in the dawn wind.

I remember the pearl in my palm in the past, half a lifetime of sorrow and joy as faint as smoke; when will I pass through the mountains and rivers after the calamity, my haggard face in the east wind, tears sprinkling on the stationery.

My livelihood is difficult, tied to my heart, I have no good poems to send in a poem tube; now seven things are expensive to plan, I regret reading scriptures with empty sleeves.

My lofty ambition has been worn away, the beautiful years like Lu Du are thrown into the passing waves; I sigh that life is truly a dream, on a clear night I cry sadly when I sing.

### Head of Emperor Constantine the Great

— Liu Shi

At the beginning of the fourth century BC, in the center of Rome, countless large and small statues were probably erected. Two giant statues were twenty-two to thirty-two feet high, in addition to eighty gilded god statues, seventy-three gold and ivory god statues, and three thousand seven hundred and eighty-five bronze statues; the number of marble statues was too numerous to count. The statue of Emperor Constantine the Great was one of them.

This head and other incomplete parts were excavated from the south corner of the Basilica. During the time of King Innocent VIII (1484-93), it was collected in the Capitoline Palace. The lower end of the neck is made into a wedge shape, which proves that this is the head of a huge commemorative statue. The hairline across the forehead suggests that there was a metal crown. According to historians, the statue may have been a seated statue of Emperor Constantine the Great, with the head, hands, and feet made of marble. This work is now in Rome, and if its height is based on a seated statue, it should be at least thirty-two feet. In the photograph, a young girl is sitting below, and her height is not even as high as the face of the statue. The tallness of the whole body can be imagined.

### Purple Fluorescence

— Xie Zi

I always think that if I get inspiration, I must write a perfect work. This work is brewing and incubating in my heart, but it has never had a concrete image. I regard it as a part of life, the totality of thought, and I regard it as an eternal gift. However, this work is too serious, too serious, and whenever I think about it, I cannot help but have a joyful and fearful tremor.

In fact, whether this work will be produced is not important. I don't quite understand what inspiration is; I just vaguely feel that inspiration will come one day. One day, it will be like a ray of strong sunlight, piercing through the clouds of my mind, allowing me to recognize myself and experience life anew in that brilliant light. At that time, I will write a perfect work, no, my life will be written into a perfect work. My life still has many blanks waiting for that stormy torrent of words!

I don't know if my talent will wither in such waiting, in such vague waiting. I even think that inspiration will only come when my talent withers. If that's the case, I'd rather it wither sooner, rather it bloom without bearing fruit, or bear fruit that doesn't ripen. I would rather exchange this bit of pitiful talent for inspiration, use this bit of purple fluorescence to exchange for brilliant sunshine. I have an excessively beautiful vision of life, and this vision forces me to make this kind of sacrifice, to make this choice. This sacrifice is not a compromise; this choice is not a mistake. I would rather live in my work than write in life.

But then I think, when my talent withers, will I still recognize that inspiration? Isn't a sky full of sunshine a cruel irony for a blind person? At that time, it should be a hazy white light: you can't see flying islands, you can't see flowers, you can't see the world's extravagance and sublimation; you can't see anything. A person whose talent has withered, even if he walks into the Garden of Eden, cannot find the beauty he longs for, the joy he desires. Because he has lost even this bit of longing, this bit of hunger and thirst.

So I remind myself, hurry, hurry! It's too late if you wait any longer. Life can't stand being delayed over and over again. If you miss this village, there will be no shop in the next. I must decide immediately, chase urgently, I must change all the sacrifices and choices I've made in the past. But thinking it over, I always feel that I lack encouragement. I lack a driving force.

Sometimes I also think that if I could get a confidant, a true confidant, use his strength to dispel my laziness; use his clarity to drive away my hesitation; or just rely on that little feeling of gratitude for knowing a confidant, I could gain the courage to be reborn, comfort myself, encourage myself, and immediately pick up a pen and paper, and create a magnificent work.

However, in this world, it is not easy to find a confidant. Everyone is busy looking for a confidant, but no one is willing to understand others. As a result, everyone cannot find a confidant, nor can they be a confidant to others. In loneliness and helplessness, they can only stubbornly pity themselves, sigh, abandon themselves!

In the end, I still think of that bit of purple fluorescence. Only it is my own; it illuminates my path in the darkness, and accompanies me in loneliness. How can I bear, how can I bear to destroy it?

### Musical Quotations

— Zhong Qi

Everyone should listen to some music, read some poetry, and look at some good paintings every day. (Goethe)

I have thought so, and dare to say: Apart from theology, music is the highest art. (Selected)

Music is a more practical course than reading, writing, arithmetic, geometry, etc. (Dr. P. P. Claxton)

Every well-educated young man and woman should be given correct basic musical knowledge at an early age. (Ruskin)

### Watching a Play

— Tian Ji

"How many people are acting, and how many people are just watching the play!" Walking out of the Tianchan Theater, the friend in front said with great emotion.

I don't know what caused this emotion, and I didn't bother to ask. Treading on the slippery road in the drizzle, I waved goodbye after walking for a while.

Although it was past midnight when I got home, I couldn't fall asleep after lying in bed. "How many people are acting!" For no reason, I suddenly remembered my friend's words, and I also sympathized with his emotion.

The clock next door struck one, but my eyes became more and more awake. In order to squeeze out some cluttered thoughts from my brain, I picked up a novel that was placed on the head of the bed, Pu Liuxian's "Awakening the World Marriage," opening to the part where Liu Jinyi twisted and turned to make his play-acting nephew an official: "It's also a scene for us grandfathers and uncles, so let them both stop this business, call them to Beijing, support him to make a future, choose a state or county assistant, although it is a stopgap measure, it is still stronger than a fake official on the stage."

It's really a coincidence, it's acting again. Liu Jinyi's idea is also strange, the fake officials on the stage can actually be real officials in the world. Then, it is true that "the stage is a small universe, and the universe is a big stage." Thinking about it carefully, it is not surprising, Tang Wang proclaimed himself emperor in Guangzhou at the end of the Ming Dynasty, removing thousands of officials a day, the crowns and clothes were all fake actors, the stage and the universe have been combined into one family, it did not start today.

"The stage is a small universe, the universe is a big stage" I don't know who came up with these two sentences in the beginning. Although it has become a cliché today, after careful thought, the meaning is still quite interesting. It is not to say that "coming out as a general" and "entering as a minister" are like real events, but the front and back stages of the stage are really like the surface and inside of a small universe.

Dressed in silk and wrapped in white, laughing, scolding, and being angry, you don't know the inside story until you get to the back stage, you don't know how much blood and tears and how many youths and lives are hidden here.

In "The Attack on Zidu," why does that martial artist perform so many styles alone? Those skills that were exchanged for life seem so superfluous here. If watching a play and watching tricks are two different things, I feel that these tricks in old plays like "The Attack on Zidu" should be cancelled, that is to say, a certain amount of blood and tears and life can be saved.

My thoughts gradually turned to a scene I saw on the way back to Shanghai a year ago. At that time, I was trapped in a county town for a whole month, and a theater troupe lived in the backyard of the hotel. Looking down from the back window upstairs, I could see a fat man of about forty years old teaching an eight- or nine-year-old girl to stand upside down on the ground with her feet in the air and her hands on the ground. After the posture was set, the person who probably belonged to the boss picked up his small teapot and went to chat with others. The girl stood upside down there, sometimes half a point, a little, or even more than a little. I turned back to sit down and read a book for a while, and then looked at the window, and she was often still standing there. This way, several times a day, several points at a time, after resting for less than five minutes, she had to stand up again: this is probably what is called practicing kung fu. Sometimes the two standing legs would just hit her head. If the boss caught a glimpse of it, her face would immediately turn iron-blue, and then the rattan whip would fall on her body. If she fell down because of being beaten, the rattan whip would fall down like a rainstorm.

After that, the posture was that she bent her two legs backwards, until her two feet touched the ground. I saw from the window that she had a hand-and-foot print every day, and the distance of this print was getting closer and closer, until it was almost connected. The girl's eyes were always filled with tears every time.

"Still crying! So useless." One day, I was sitting and reading a novel when this sound led me to the window, followed by the ping-pong sound of the rattan whip.

I also remembered the few circuses that I had watched in the past, which were actually just playing with people, and what I got was the stimulation of the destruction and persecution of tender lives. I suspected that this was a plaything only for sadomasochists. Ordinary people can only bring back unhappiness. After that, I stopped watching this kind of circus without horses. But I didn't expect that behind the "small universe" was also this scene. Because of this, I was depressed all day long. One day, a newly acquainted companion came to my room, I pointed it out to him and told him my feelings.

"It's all like this, you can't be flexible if you don't practice your body." The strange thing is that he didn't think it was strange at all. Then he hummed, it was also Peking opera.

"Are you surprised?" he stopped singing and asked me.

I didn't answer. I just thought that acting is like life: acting is life, learning to act is also life, and the whole life is acting.

The clock has struck two. The words of that friend rang in my ears again, "How many people are acting, and how many people are just watching the play!"

### An Inch of Mountain, an Inch of River, an Inch of Blood 521

— Ye Jingfeng

"Whistle..." Shouyi gently let out a whistle.

"Whistle whistle...?" Someone responded from the shadows on the side.

"09...?" Shouyi asked, aiming at the source of the signal.

"...15." Before the reply was finished, a thin, small figure flashed and ran to the side of the car.

"Thank you, thank you!" Shouyi comforted the person who came.

"You've worked hard!" The person responded; "Less than a hundred yards ahead, we have another small sentry post. After that post, it's a wasteland. After walking through the wasteland, that small Western-style house is the den. According to reports, there are searchlights and light machine guns mounted on the roof." The voice of the person was sharp, quite like a woman's voice.

"Thank you... Has anyone from our side been here?" Shouyi seemed a little anxious.

"At my station, no one from our side has passed by in the last hour. Even the other side, or irrelevant people, only three to five people have passed by, most of them are locals."

"Is this Hongzhen?" Hejian asked tentatively. After leaving Shanghai, he seemed to have become a country bumpkin.

"Two or three hundred yards north of that wasteland is the border of Hongzhen." The little guy responded.

"So, if someone detours from Hongzhen and enters the bandit den, can your station see it?" Hejian asked about Hongzhen, which turned out to be intentional.

"Detouring is also possible, but it's a third farther than this road, and it's all small roads, so you can't drive... But it can also be determined that no one from our side has entered the bandit den from that side..."

"How do you know?" Shouyi asked.

"There are two simple reasons; first, we also have a sentry line over there, and if someone from our side passes by, a signal will be sent. But I didn't hear the signal. Second, if someone invades the bandit den, I'm afraid it won't be so quiet, and you won't even hear a gunshot. It seems impossible."

"Isn't there a little disturbance?" Shouyi was still a little unconvinced.

"At least from my side, there is no slight disturbance... To the east, two or three hundred yards east of the den, we also planted one or two sentry lines. I don't know if there is any news. Because it is too far away from here, and there is this den in the middle, I don't want to disturb them, so we agreed not to transmit news unless it is extremely important, extremely urgent news..."

"Doesn't the other side set up a defense line?" Hejian thought of the other side's calmness.

"The other side's strength is probably all in the den; there are no outposts outside, only mobile patrols, in groups of five or six; they patrolled once half an hour ago, with a careless attitude, not serious at all; it can be inferred that the den is definitely not very nervous—perhaps they think no one dares to raid the den... but the strength is quite solid."

"I plan to go into the den to investigate." Shouyi discussed with Hejian.

"I'll go too!" Hejian was very firm.

"So, do we go together or separately?" Shouyi wanted to see Hejian's courage.

"Either way is fine! It just depends on which action is more beneficial."

### Rambling Talks on Solitude

— Wang Cong

Professor Borges said it well: "What good are all these magnificent new streets and bridges to me? If I can't think on them the way I like."

I think thought is more necessary for people than breathing. Can you imagine what a person would look like after stopping breathing for five minutes? Can you imagine the pain of a person being forbidden to think freely?

I can't help but think of a story.

It was probably something from ancient Greece. There was a wise man who was the first to realize that the earth was round, but this statement violated the religious concept of the time. So the priests, who held the power of life and death, grabbed the wise man. Then, with a knife on his neck, he was asked to admit his absurdity and faithfully shout: "The earth is square!" In this way, the knife could leave his head, otherwise, the knife would sweep across his neck; his head and body would be separated.

"I can say that the earth is square." The wise man said calmly. Just as the knife was about to leave his neck, he added frankly, "However, however, the earth is actually round." The knife finally swept across the wise man's head.

What is absurd is the priest's knife. Who said that the knife can kill the truth?

This wise man first illuminated our dark human history. As for his death, it only shows us the inevitable fate of all prophets.

Goethe said it well: "I am too old for everything, except for the truth."

Freedom Talk

### Blood Lessons - Written for the May Thirtieth Commemoration

— Tang Shan

Today, twenty-two years ago, the situation in Shanghai was also turbulent, and the surface state was more serious than that of today's Shanghai. From the shooting of Gu Zhenghong, a foreman at the Shanghai Japanese Naigaiwata Textile Company, to the outbreak of the Nanjing Road Massacre, the entire China immediately converged into a tide of anti-imperialism. The crowd on the eve of the Great Revolution not only made powerful voices in action, but also shocked the imperialists in practice. The boycott movement against Britain and Japan at that time made it impossible for foreign goods to be seen anywhere in China.

We failed diplomatically in the May 30th Incident; because the imperialists only compensated the victims with a limited amount of pension. But from the perspective of anti-imperialist struggle, this was the first bomb of resistance from a small and weak nation. Since the Shanghai Massacre, there have been the "June 11th Massacre" in Hankou, and the "June 23rd" Shameen Massacre in Guangzhou. The imperialists certainly showed their hideous faces everywhere, and applied military pressure, but this promoted the unity of Chinese workers. The long-term strike of nearly 100,000 workers in Guangzhou and Hong Kong in 1925-26 can be said to have laid the foundation for China's subsequent revolutionary unification.

From the lessons of blood, we know that the front line of struggle must require unity; secondly, the purpose of struggle must represent the interests of the majority of the people. If these two basic principles are violated, the price of sacrifice is not worth it; naturally, there is no talk of success. After the May 30th Incident, the reason why it could immediately shock the whole country, and all circles in various places rose up to support it, was because everyone was based on the same understanding, the same interests, and the same goals. Therefore, everyone has always worked together in the same position.

Now Japanese imperialism has fallen, and the unequal treaties of the powers in China have also been abolished one after another. However, the situation in China today has not yet revealed a glimmer of light. Although the red-headed police officers on Nanjing Road have disappeared, no one dares to deny that the air on Nanjing Road is peaceful. What we hear and see is a tragic scene! The suffocation and pain in people's hearts are as deep as they were twenty-two years ago.

What is especially sad is that in this depressed atmosphere, many people are almost numb, their emotions have been declining, although they are angry, they can only sigh.

On the occasion of this bloody commemoration, recalling the bloodshed of the martyrs will make us doubly vigilant!

### Are There Only Two Directions at the Poles?

— Jiang Juling

My friend, Mr. Danyan, and I argued for a long time about the direction of the two poles. I said there is only one direction at the poles (the North Pole only has south, the South Pole only has north), but Mr. Danyan stubbornly insisted, with "a lifetime of cleverness, confused for a moment," that there are also east, west, north, and south. Thus, the argument began. I used a ball to represent the fixed North and South Poles, proving that there is only one direction. Then, Mr. Danyan expressed "surrender," and I won the debate. Based on theory, I further explained that when an airplane flies to the South Pole or North Pole, the compass needle must rotate one hundred and eighty degrees. Mr. Danyan vehemently denied this again. However, when I drew Shanghai and New York, two places on opposite sides of the Earth, on the ball, and showed that an airplane flying from Shanghai to New York via the North Pole would require the compass to change direction and become a "south-pointing needle" if it were to maintain its original orientation, Mr. Danyan conceded defeat again. However, she said that when the airplane reaches the "polar point" (note) of the two poles, the compass needle would be stopped or rotate erratically until it passes over the "polar point," and only then would it undergo a one hundred and eighty-degree change; no correct change is possible if it only "flies to" and not "flies over." I thought carefully about it and realized that what she said made sense because at that point, all directions would be south.

These are all theoretical debates. What it's actually like in practice remains to be determined by explorers circumnavigating the Earth north and south; moreover, the actual size of Antarctica is still a mystery. If you simply observe the maps of the eastern and western hemispheres and note the significant difference in the distribution of land and water on the north and south sides of the equator, you might suspect that Antarctica might have a very large landmass. Furthermore, we have only circumnavigated the Earth east and west, and there is no record of circumnavigating north and south through the poles!

(Note) This is Mr. Danyan referring to the "extreme point" of the two poles, rather than the "pole" or "polar line" of the "polar point" in geometry.

When Councilor Duan Zhuo described the difficulty of transportation on the railway from Xi'an to Tianshui, he specifically cited a popular folk story, saying, "An old man boarded the train with a half-price ticket. When the ticket inspector asked him why, he replied that he was a child when he bought the ticket, but by the time he squeezed onto the train, his beard and hair had turned white," which caused a roar of laughter throughout the hall.

A half-price ticket is undoubtedly for a child.
How does boarding the train transform one into an old man with white hair?
Councilors known for humor all laugh,
But in the end, the road to success still passes through!

Words may be clever,
But the metaphor is loose.
How many refugees long to return home?
Hoping to become wandering souls in a foreign land,
Forever longing for their homes separated by ten thousand mountains!

### Reading "A History of China's War of Resistance"

— Fengyun

Allow me to introduce to readers this monumental historical document published after the war: "A History of China's War of Resistance" by Cao Juren and Shu Zongqiao. We, having traversed the eight years of war filled with blood and continuous gunfire, should look back and see the arduous and long road we have traveled in the past. In those scenes of raging flames, blood, and tears, there are indeed many meanings worth learning from and lessons worth taking.

Japan has been defeated. A worshiper of fascism who wanted to rely on "power" and "violence" is now submissively prostrate before "justice" and "fairness" in the world. This is, of course, a matter of course. However, what we cannot help but be concerned about is that only a little over a year after world peace, even as the pain of those around the globe burned by the flames of war has not yet subsided, we can hear the scent of gunpowder everywhere again. The confrontation between two major camps; mutual suspicion, fear, and vigilance; are these the only lessons that the world war has brought us?

Let us take Japan as an example. Under the care of General MacArthur, its light industry has gradually returned to its original state, and its export trade is about to erode the Far East again. The Japanese people's demand for the minimum level of military equipment within the country is also brilliantly regarded as an event not worth surprising.

But in China over these past two years, as I leaf through "An Illustrated History of China's War of Resistance," a monumental work including 400,000 words, I cannot help but lament our bewilderment and unease.

China, in the Far East, in Asia, and in the entire eastern hemisphere of the world, should be the force of stability for world peace. When the whole world fears that a third world war is about to descend upon the world, how eagerly do the people of the world hope for China? They not only hope that China will embark on a path of peace and happiness, but also hope that China can truly act as a bridge between the United States and the Soviet Union, turning many misunderstandings and disputes in the world into auspiciousness and jade and silk.

This is just as the author of this book especially mentioned in the "title page": "The 'Big Four' status that we won with the great sacrifices of the long-term war of resistance was reduced from 'Big Five' to being excluded from 'Big Four' in this year of the war's end. We look at our position in the international community and think about the evil situation brewing in the Pacific Ocean in the future. The future is bleak, beyond imagination."

This feeling of lamentation is not just a representation of the author's state of mind.

"An Illustrated History of China's War of Resistance" has a total of 448 pages, with over 1,000 images. The entire book is divided into ten chapters. The war history on which it is based strives for truthfulness, and the narration is able to achieve objectivity and impartiality. Many materials are citations from the records and works of third parties, striving to avoid subjective judgments. This point should be the most valuable aspect of the entire book.

The "Commentary on Historical Materials of the War of Resistance" in the appendix is the author's explanation of his attitude and methods in handling the materials, which can serve as a reference for all compilation works.

This epic, including the most valuable eight years of China's War of Resistance, is one that every reader should treasure.

### Qing Dynasty Physician Ye Tianshi

— Huiguang

Ye Tianshi was a famous physician of the Qing dynasty, and there are many anecdotes about him. Once a person becomes famous, legendary stories spread, often exaggerating and embellishing, which cannot be easily believed. However, there is one story about Ye Tianshi that is quite interesting, and I will record it below:

After Ye Tianshi became famous, those seeking treatment came in an endless stream. One day, he was being carried in a sedan chair when a villager greeted him on the side of the road and begged him to treat his illness. Ye stopped the sedan chair and examined him, saying, "All six pulses are harmonious. What is the illness?" The villager said, "You are a famous doctor, and you can understand all kinds of difficult and dangerous diseases. What I suffer from is poverty. I don't know if you can cure it?" Ye smiled and said, "This disease is quite easy to treat. Come and get the prescription tonight, and one dose will cure it." At dusk, the villager knocked on his door and begged for medicine to cure his poverty. Ye instructed him to collect olive pits in the city and plant them. When the seedlings grow, come and tell me, and you will get a great profit. The villager did as he was told. After a few days, the seedlings grew vigorously. He ran to tell Ye. Ye said, "From today, when there are people seeking seedlings, raise the price and don't sell them cheaply!" Ye himself used olive seedlings as a medicinal guide in his prescriptions. Those with illnesses vied to buy them. After a few days, the seedlings became scarce, and the number of people seeking them increased. The price increased. The villager made countless money. When the seedlings were gone, the medicinal guide was also removed. Later, the villager prepared a gift to thank him. Ye said, "Is the illness cured?" The villager said, "Thanks to your help, I am completely cured." Ye smiled and sent him away. To this day, the people of Wu still tell this story as a beautiful tale.

### White Elephant (Part 1)

— Feng Zikai

White Elephant is my family's beloved cat. Originally, it was the beloved cat of my second daughter, Lin Xian, and even earlier, it was the beloved cat of old Mrs. Duan.

At the beginning of the War of Resistance, old Mrs. Duan took White Elephant with her to flee to the rear. After the victory, she brought it back to Shanghai, where it lived near my second daughter, Lin Xian, and my son-in-law, Song Mufa. For some reason, old Mrs. Duan entrusted White Elephant and its only son, Little White Elephant, to Lin Xian and Mufa, and they became their beloved cats. When I went to Shanghai, Lin Xian and Mufa entrusted White Elephant to me, locking it in a cage made of Wuxi gluten, taking it on the train, and bringing it back to Hangzhou, where it lived in a small house by the West Lake and became my family's beloved cat.

White Elephant is truly a lovable cat! Not only because it is snow-white and as grand as an elephant, but also because its eyes are one yellow and one blue, called "sun and moon eyes." When it walks out of the sunlight, its pupils are so narrow that they are almost invisible. Its eyes look like two lights of different colors installed on a theater stage. Everyone who sees it is amazed and praises it. The person who collects electricity bills almost forgets to take the money when he sees it. The police officer checking household registration also temporarily stops checking when he sees it.

After White Elephant came to my house, Mufa and Lin Xian often wrote letters, saying that old Mrs. Duan had moved elsewhere but often visited them to see Little White Elephant, with the purpose of asking about White Elephant's recent situation. My youngest daughter, Yiyin, sympathized with old Mrs. Duan's sorrow of separation and often took photos of White Elephant and sent them to Lin Xian to pass on to old Mrs. Duan to comfort her longing. At the same time, she showed even more care for White Elephant. Every day when Yiyin returned home from school, or when her elder sister, Chen Bao, returned home from teaching, as soon as they sat down, White Elephant would jump onto their laps and sleep honestly and unceremoniously. They couldn't bear to refuse, so they would sit still and ask people for tea, water, a change of shoes, and the newspaper. Sometimes when the workers weren't around, my old wife and I would act as servants, delivering tea, water, shoes, and newspapers. We really served White Elephant.

One day, White Elephant disappeared. We searched everywhere but couldn't find it. Just as we were worrying, it quietly returned with a tabby cat. Everyone was pleasantly surprised. My daughter, Xiuying, said it was a male cat from Zhaoxian Temple. After saying that, she laughed. After a short pause, everyone laughed. It turned out that it had gone to the Buddhist temple to find a lover without telling anyone, causing us to be worried to death.

### Greer Garson in "Rich World"

### Butterfly Loves Flowers

— Hu Lu

Love Tester – See the Agence France-Presse report from Paris in this newspaper on May 25th. A Danish scientist has invented a love tester that can test the depth of love.

Who can fathom the secrets of love?
The depths of men and women's private emotions are like the sea!
The most feared is when marriage becomes a tomb,
And mutual love is difficult to maintain!

A surprising telegram from Paris reports,
That there is a device that can know the depth of love!
If we add this lively treasure,
It will not be difficult to cheat and turn things upside down!

### Chronicle of a Besieged City

— Qin Shouou

Only when Old Xu heard the last two sentences did he nod in agreement.

"Is it still possible to replenish the goods now? You are, after all, an amateur!" At this point, he still couldn't forget that business is business.

A very natural reply welled up in Old Zhu's mouth, but he didn't say it because he didn't want to use words to strike this failed profiteer off a national crisis at this time.

"Amateur or expert, it's best not to talk about it at this time." He tried his best to reduce the sarcastic element, but Xu Shaoming's face was already flushed. "So what are you planning to do now, old brother? Is there anything you need this poor man to run errands for you?"

Xu Shaoming gave a bitter, emotional laugh.

"I don't have any plans right now. Anyway, I've lost everything, so whether I flee or not doesn't matter." He rubbed his hands together vigorously. "It's just that I can't lose all those goods for nothing. People from the military came to inform me just now that any merchants who suffered losses in this ammunition truck explosion can receive some compensation, as long as they can provide evidence. Fortunately, all my goods were on the books, and the books didn't burn..."

Old Zhu also understood the mentality of these standard merchants very well: "Money above all else, goods first." Since he had nothing to offer him in this regard, it was best not to give advice.

"I came to town to find a car. Judging by this situation, I'll probably have to stay here with you for a few days, old brother!" Of course, he could only give a few perfunctory words to these kinds of people, and in fact, Old Zhu's heart was also burning with anxiety. It was almost eleven o'clock, and if he couldn't find a car in two more hours, he wouldn't be able to leave today. Others might be able to wait, but what about Lan, who was seriously ill? Therefore, he decided to immediately return to the highway station to wait for passing vehicles. Xu Fatty didn't keep him either. As they were parting, Old Zhu couldn't help but add:

"Your relative, Mrs. Hu, and Feifei are with us."

Xu Shaoming waved his hand listlessly, still walking back to the pile of tiles where he had been sitting. It was as if he hadn't heard what Old Zhu said.

With a cold laugh of mockery from the bottom of his heart, Zhu Zhaonian immediately quickened his pace and hurried away.
