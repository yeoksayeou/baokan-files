### Relevant Authorities Discuss Detailed Measures, Executive Yuan to Expand Powers, Draft of National Assets Declaration and Registration Overseas Passed, Awaiting Completion of Legislative Procedures Before Promulgation

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 30th] Reliable sources confirm: The Executive Yuan will expand its powers, possessing a more decisive significance than at present.

The methods for expansion are being carefully discussed by relevant authorities. It is said that the reason is that although the current Executive Yuan appears in the guise of a "responsible cabinet," many actual government affairs decisions still require the final decision of the State Council. The State Council functions as both a policy-making body and an actual government affairs decision-making body, while the Executive Yuan becomes merely a transitional organization responsible for relaying information, which violates the true meaning of a responsible cabinet. Therefore, the expansion of its powers is inevitable.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 30th] The Draft Regulations on the Declaration and Registration of Foreign Exchange Assets Deposited Abroad by Citizens of the Republic of China has been passed by the Executive Yuan's routine meeting on [blank] day, and by the [blank] National Government Committee. It will be submitted to the Legislative Yuan to complete the legislative procedures before being promulgated and implemented. It is understood that the draft regulations include the following main points: Registration period: All Chinese citizens, except those who resided abroad before July 7, 1937, or those who legally operated businesses abroad before the same date, shall declare and register their foreign exchange assets deposited abroad on the date the regulations are promulgated and implemented, within 30 days of the promulgation and implementation of the regulations, according to the prescribed forms, to the National Bank. Foreign exchange obtained after the promulgation of these regulations shall be registered within 30 days from the date of acquisition. Registration authorities: Consulates in the locations of overseas Chinese residents. Applicable objects: Including natural persons and legal entities. Foreign exchange assets to be declared: Including cash, current and fixed foreign currency deposits, foreign gold coins, raw gold, and any payment rights obtained from foreign countries (such as foreign currency securities, stocks, bonds, land deeds, insurance policies, annuities, etc. issued by the Chinese or foreign governments). Furthermore, for foreign exchange assets that are jointly owned or co-managed with foreigners, the portion owned or managed by Chinese citizens shall be declared and registered. For foreign exchange assets applied for registration, the income or changes obtained from deposits and foreign currency assets may be retained according to the following provisions, except for a certain amount: The remaining amount shall be transferred to the National Bank account under the original contract holder's name. 1. Daily living expenses for the individual or their family residing abroad. 2. Medical expenses for the individual or their family for treatment of illnesses abroad. 3. Daily living expenses for children residing abroad during their study period. 4. Travel expenses for the individual or their family traveling abroad and returning home. 5. Funds necessary for operating legal agriculture, industry, commerce, and mining businesses. The above items are limited to those who have already gone abroad before the promulgation of these measures. The retained amount will be determined separately by the Ministry of Finance. Deposits transferred to the National Bank account, in addition to being exchanged for legal tender at the individual's discretion, may, with the approval documents based on import permits for purchasing permissible imported materials or for other legitimate uses, be used to draw from the original currency deposits. If there are any production tools among the encouraged imported materials, the government should provide facilities for establishing factories and transportation. After the promulgation of these regulations, except for those handled in accordance with the methods stipulated in the preceding two articles, Chinese citizens shall not transfer foreign exchange assets in any way to any natural persons or legal entities at home or abroad. Any Chinese citizen who fails to declare and register their foreign exchange assets in accordance with the regulations, or who makes false declarations, shall be severely punished and their foreign exchange assets confiscated.

### Opening Up Political Power in Guangdong, Hubei, and Anhui, The Government has Notified the Min and Youth Parties that they Can Nominate Three Provincial Committee Members to Participate Separately

[News from this newspaper] Reliable sources say that the government has agreed to [partially] open up local political power in Guangdong, Hubei, and Anhui provinces. The Min and Youth parties can each nominate three provincial committee members to participate in the administrative organizations of the three provinces. Both parties have received notification from the government. The Youth Party's response to this will be decided by the Central Standing Committee within a few days. The Min She Party's position is that [they will] participate in local public opinion institutions, but are temporarily unwilling to assume actual responsibilities. Therefore, they are taking a non-contending attitude on the point of opening up local political power. If the government invites them to serve on the provincial committee, they are willing to consider it, but they are unwilling to concurrently serve as the head of any department. Regarding the Shanghai Municipal Council's opposition to the parties' request to appoint councilors, a spokesman for the Min She Party said: Shanghai councilors are indeed elected, but councilors in other provinces and cities are appointed. In fact, they are designated by the government as a temporary public opinion institution, and the [nomination] requests of the parties are aimed at this. The party does not intend to give a formal response to the statement of the speaker and deputy speaker of the municipal council.

### Soliciting Opinions on the Peace Treaty with Japan, Ye Gongchao Invites Representatives from All Parties in Shanghai to a Discussion and Makes a Record to Send to the Peace Treaty Review Committee

[Central News Agency, This City] Since its establishment, the Secret Committee on the Peace Treaty with Japan of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has held several meetings to listen to the opinions of the participants on issues related to the peace treaty with Japan. In order to solicit more opinions, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Ye Gongchao specially came to Shanghai with Huang Zhengming, Director of the East Asian Department, yesterday. In the afternoon, at 4 pm, he invited more than 20 representatives from all relevant parties in the city, including the Municipal Council, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the press, representatives from industry and commerce, and social celebrities, to hold a symposium on the fourth floor of the Bank of China to listen to their opinions, so that a record can be made and sent to the Peace Treaty Review Committee for reference. It is understood that the purpose of this meeting, in addition to listening to the opinions provided by all sectors, is also to make all parties understand the government's attitude and position on the peace treaty with Japan. Ye told a reporter from the Central News Agency yesterday that our country has always maintained a consistent attitude on the issue of the peace treaty with Japan. All claims are based on safeguarding our country's position. Because our country's position is not entirely the same as that of other countries, our claims and capabilities have our own reasons. In his recent speeches, Foreign Minister Wang has clearly explained this point.

According to relevant sources, the Chinese side absolutely insists on retaining the right of veto, and China's attitude is determined by China's own needs. Some foreign opinions misunderstand that our country is influenced by the Soviet Union, but the attitude held by our country has sufficient reasons.

Yesterday afternoon's symposium was chaired by Ye Gongchao. The meeting lasted for two hours and ended at six o'clock. The list of participants and the content of the discussion will not be announced for the time being.

### Problem of Packaging the First Batch of Japanese Reparation Machines Unresolved

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 30th, United Press] Among the machine tools and precision tools in the first batch of emergency reparations from Japan to China and other countries, 51% are first-class tools that can be used with only minor repairs. According to the current reparations plan, China can obtain 50% of the total amount of this batch of materials, while the Philippines, the Netherlands, and the United Nations of the British Empire can evenly divide the remaining 50%. This batch of machines, from small precision tools to hydraulic presses, has a total of 19,500 machines, of which 43% belong to the second class, including drilling machines, chiseling machines, drilling machines, lathes, textile machines, and other secondary tools for processing metals. Among them are bending machines, hydraulic presses, mechanical presses, and trimming [blank] machines. This batch of machines varies in age, but more than half are classified as "usable after minor repairs." The question of which country should bear the cost of collection and packaging has not yet been decided, but some experts believe that the cost of packaging will seriously hit Japan's reconstruction plans.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 30th] Sources in diplomatic circles: Regarding the opening of private trade with [blank], the Far Eastern Commission approved a quota of 400 private individuals and merchant representatives from various countries to go to Japan in July. After the number of people allocated to each member state was decided, the remaining 45 people were originally intended to be allocated to other non-member countries. Recently, according to a notification from the US State Department, the allocation method for the remaining quota has been re-[revised]. Among them, six places were reserved for the member state, the Soviet Union. The remaining 39 places have been allocated to non-Far Eastern Commission countries.

### US Army Department Proposes Plan to Help Us Train Ten New Divisions, Awaiting Approval from Washington Before Implementation

[United Press, Nanjing, 30th] Authoritative sources claim that in response to Chairman Chiang's request for whether the US military can assist in training the National Army, the US Army Department has proposed a plan to train, equip, and supply ten divisions of the National Army. General Sun Liren has established a training school in Taiwan. Once Washington approves the plan, it can be implemented.

It is said that the US Army Department will tell Chairman Chiang that ten divisions of American-trained troops can enable the National Army to contain the Communist Army and control all important areas. It is estimated that this plan will take one year to complete. Although ten divisions of troops are not enough to "eliminate" the Communist Army, 100,000 personnel will definitely be able to prevent serious interference by the Communist Army with China's economic and political recovery. It is understood that this plan will be released in Washington at the same time as the Wedemeyer report.

According to this plan, each division will receive three months of training, as each division already has some combat experience. Afterwards, the strength of each division will be increased to 15,000 people, and they will be transferred to the rear for another three months of rigorous training, during which American instructors will train them in the use of American weapons. Once the training is completed, they will be equipped with American weapons and transferred to the front lines for combat.

One of the main procedures in the proposed plan is to guide the air force in transporting and supplying these troops. US Army advisors have stated that what the Chinese government needs most in fighting the Communist Army is transport planes, not fighter planes. Therefore, China should be given light weapons rather than heavy weapons, as they believe that the weakness of the National Army in the Northeast is that the Communist Army has greater mobility. Therefore, the National Army does not need heavy artillery, giant tanks, or large trucks, as the terrain in China is rugged roads and rice paddies, so light transportation vehicles are needed.

The party did not specify how many US military advisors would be needed to implement this training plan, but it is believed that it will be greatly expanded, as there are currently only about 400 US military officers stationed in China, of which 20% are engaged in administrative work.

It is understood that US Army officials believe that training personnel should be widespread, with at least one in each battalion, to ensure the success of this plan.

[This Newspaper, Yanzhou, 30th] The easternmost contingent of Chen Yi's troops, who fled south across the Longhai Railway line from southwestern Shandong, reportedly crossed the southern section of the Jinpu Railway at Suixikou, east of Yongcheng, and infiltrated into the area north of Lingbi.

It has aroused widespread speculation among the citizens as to why the contingent of communist bandits who harassed the outskirts of Yongcheng and Xiayi southwest of Xuzhou took this action.

Editorial

### Opinions on the Draft Commercial Registration Law

The Ministry of Economic Affairs intends to revise the Commercial Registration Law. The key points and outline of the draft have been published in this newspaper. The current law was promulgated and implemented on June 28, 1937, and its implementing regulations were promulgated and implemented on May 19, 1938. After ten years, many objective conditions have changed, and judging from its content, there are many inherent shortcomings, so it should be revised in a timely manner.

It is reported that this draft has been jointly reviewed by the Ministries of Social Affairs, Economy, Finance, and Justice, and it was unanimously considered "very important and agreed upon." We also believe that the latter law is indeed better than the former, with many advantages, especially the addition of a chapter on businesses operated by foreigners, which is very timely. However, considering the entire text, there are still many places that need to be discussed and revised. We will list them separately for reference.

The scope of commerce does not adopt a listing method. Article 3 of the current law lists sixteen types of businesses as commerce. Not only are there many omissions, but the classification is also too broad, so it is better to change to a definition-based provision, which is cleaner. However, Article 4 also has a supplement, "considered as commerce," so there is actually no difference. However, the revised draft is more concise in form.

Article 21 of the current law stipulates: "In the same county or city, the name of a business that has already been registered by another person shall not be used for the registration of the same business." No difference is seen in this draft. The purpose of commercial registration is to protect the rights of business names. This is the spirit of commercial registration, so there is no need to change it. The problem lies in the "same business" point, that is, what is considered the same business, and what is not considered the same business? This is closely related to whether it is listed or not. Taking Shanghai as an example, because commerce is particularly prosperous and the division of industries is particularly detailed, the sixteen types of commerce are actually no longer applicable. Many businesses' target customers often belong to two or even two or more industries, and at the same time belong to two or even two or more trade associations. For example, industrial raw materials are of course operated by the chemical raw materials industry, but pharmacies also concurrently operate this business. Some domestic pigments are also this type of goods, so a difficult problem arises. If it is said that it is the same business, then they argue forcefully, claiming that it belongs to two industries and two trade associations, and do not recognize it as the same business, so using a business name already registered by another person is not considered illegal. But if they are allowed to use it, then what they operate, at least in part, is industrial raw materials, which is actually the same business. This problem has not been solved by the current law, and the draft still has not solved it. We believe that the listing of commercial classifications is indeed necessary. However, if the central government uniformly stipulates it, the situations in various places are different, and it is inevitable that it will be like cutting the feet to fit the shoes, with many inconsistencies. It seems better to authorize the local competent officials to carefully consider and deliberate according to the actual situation in the local area and report to the Ministry for approval.

Registration of business names with the same name. In fact, many businesses use the same name as others, intentionally or unintentionally, such as "Lu Gao Jian," "Lao Da Fang," "Zhang Xiao Quan," and so on. There are countless examples. Article 34 of the implementing regulations stipulates: "A business name that has been used before another person's registration is not subject to the restrictions of Articles 21 and 22 of this law; however, there must be proof of prior establishment." This can be considered to have resolved some of the disputes. Also, because there are too many businesses with the same name in the same county or city, the previous method is not enough to cope with it. Therefore, the Ministry supplemented another method, that is, if many businesses with the same name mutually agree and provide written proof, they are all allowed to apply for registration, which may cause disputes. Because those who have already registered and those who are more qualified often refuse to provide written proof. Those who have joined the trade association as members are especially unwilling to provide proof for non-members who have not joined the association. This problem cannot be solved. The draft does not touch on this, which is obviously a major flaw.

The old custom had a method of adding a record, but it is not allowed by the current laws and regulations; in fact, accommodating the facts is not without being a compromise. For example, if the "Lu Gao Jian" mentioned above was originally established earlier, it should be allowed to add a record and be allowed to register separately, which seems more convenient than the method of mutual agreement and proof.

There is also a special fact, that is, old business names passed down from ancestors. If the business develops and the brothers use the same brand name under mutual agreement or the will of the ancestors, each operates their own business; in this situation, if they are allowed to add a record and register, it seems reasonable. However, under the current law, this path is blocked.

A business uses several business names. That is, a head office has several branches, although they use several names, but their capital is not divided. If these newly created businesses are allowed to register separately, there is no capital amount to fill in, and their conditions are not met; if they are not allowed to register, then these types of businesses have no way to obtain legal protection. The current law has no explicit provisions, so the competent officials reject them all. I wonder if the draft has any remedy for this?

Registration restrictions. Article 6 of the implementing regulations: "The business of being considered a business according to Article 4 of this law is limited to those that do not violate public order and good customs." According to this provision, as long as it does not violate public order and good customs, and the procedures are complete, it can be approved for registration without any other restrictions. However, in reality, there are indeed many that have to be restricted. For example, when a certain type of goods is implemented at a parity price, there are often many speculative businesses that spring up like clouds, and everyone seeks windfall profits. If they are all allowed to register, wouldn't it be encouraging speculation and disrupting the market? If registration is not allowed, what is the basis in law? Is the above article sufficient as a basis for refusing registration? What supplements does the draft have for this?

Mandatory registration. The current law originally adopted a free registration system, and there are no articles that can be used as a basis for mandatory registration. The current mandatory registration method is based on the Ministry's order in 1943, which is to change the law by order, and there are legal problems. The draft changes to mandatory registration, which can remedy the above defects and is a kind of progress in legislation. What can be discussed is whether this measure is necessary in fact? What is the meaning to the public and private? As mentioned above: Commercial registration was originally for the purpose of protecting its business name rights. Then, when businessmen themselves do not need this protection, they can freely decide and do not need to be forced. The draft explains: "Changing to a mandatory registration system enables the government to use the registration system to reasonably manage commerce and make it develop normally." This is the purpose. But we are very skeptical: Is it necessary for businesses to register before the government can manage them? Can they develop normally? If they don't register, can't they achieve the above purpose? To give an example, the government's current management methods are nothing more than price limits, price negotiations, cracking down on speculation and hoarding, etc. Then, we must ask: Can those who do not register not comply with these laws and regulations? When the government wants to implement these laws and regulations, is it necessary to first check the registered businesses according to the map? If, as mentioned above, speculative businesses obtain the registration qualification, they can apply for allocation. Then, is mandatory registration turning against them and allowing them to legally seek windfall profits? If, in order to prevent the above malpractices, restrictions can be added as appropriate, then under the current free registration system, there are not enough articles to cite, let alone after mandatory registration?

As repeatedly said above: The purpose of commercial registration is nothing more than to protect its business name rights. As for whether the business can be legally operated, there are many types that still need to be approved by the competent authority, such as obtaining a license, permit, etc. However, many businessmen, knowing little, often mistake registration for approval of operations, and regard the registration certificate as a license or permit. They believe that since the government has allowed registration, they can freely operate, which has caused many troubles. Those who understand the matter clearly also dislike applying separately, which is considered troublesome. Therefore, on the merits of the case, changing to the mandatory registration method is actually superfluous.

If the initial registration fee is set at one-thousandth of the capital amount, which is double the current rate in Shanghai, it will inevitably increase the burden on businessmen. Also, the supplementary provisions of the draft stipulate: Before the implementation of the new law, the registration made according to the current law, although having the same effect as the registration made according to the new law, if the original registered items do not conform to or are missing according to the new law, an application for change of registration should be made within one year. According to this, businessmen have to redo a set of procedures. We believe that these are all things that can be avoided and work that can be saved.

The Ministry of Economic Affairs announced this draft to solicit opinions from public and private legal persons before submitting it to the Executive Yuan for discussion. We hope that the above-mentioned points still have room for deliberation and remedy. Also, what the Ministry announced was originally only the key points of the draft, not the full text. We hope that the various shortcomings mentioned above are all stipulated in it.

### The United Nations Approves Pakistan's Efforts Officially Joins the United Nations The Non-Permanent Members of the Security Council are Re-elected The Membership Applications of the Five Axis Satellite States Have Not Yet Been Decided

[This Newspaper News] Lake Success, 30th Broadcast: Lake Success News, Due to the unanimous support of the United States and the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia's election as a non-permanent member of the Security Council is almost a certainty. However, Czechoslovakia itself is unwilling to take on this important task, because it is not easy to deal with properly at a time when the conflict between East and West is on the rise. In addition to the United States and the Soviet Union, China, the United Kingdom, and 20 Latin American countries have also expressed their support, and France may also take the same attitude. Argentina and Canada are almost certain to be elected as the other two non-permanent members of the Security Council.

[Associated Press, New York, 30th Dispatch] In addition to discussing and approving the accession of Pakistan and Yemen to the United Nations today, the General Assembly will also conduct the re-election of the three members of the Security Council. According to diplomatic circles' predictions, although Czechoslovakia itself is unwilling, it is expected to be elected as a member of the Security Council, otherwise the Soviet Union will inevitably be isolated in the Council.

[Reuters, Lake Success, 30th Dispatch] The United Nations General Assembly today will elect a member of the Security Council to fill the seat vacated by the resignation of Bajimlin. Forty-eight hours ago, it was generally believed that Argentina was expected to be elected with the strong support of the American countries, but the situation changed abruptly on the eve of the election. The Latin American countries, dissatisfied with the Peron regime and Argentina's disregard for the previous General Assembly resolution, refused to recall its ambassador to Spain, and are prepared to elect Uruguay. This election is scheduled to be held at 4 p.m. today, standard time.

[Central News Agency, Lake Success, 29th Dispatch] The Security Council continued to discuss the applications of Italy, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Finland for membership today, but no formal decision was made on any application. Representatives of the United States and the United Kingdom stated that they did not support the applications of Hungary and Bulgaria, because the current governments of these two countries suppressed civil rights and basic freedoms. The Soviet Union also clearly stated that if the Security Council made an unfavorable decision on the applications of Hungary, Bulgaria, Poland, and Finland, the Soviet Union would also veto Italy's application. The United Kingdom criticized the Soviet Union's position as an attempt to make an "improper transaction," and Australia also criticized its statement as inconsistent with the spirit of the United Nations Charter, because the Charter stipulates that each application should be decided according to its own merits.

### Pakistani Representative Delivers First Speech Willing to Cooperate in Promoting Favorable International Cooperation

[Reuters, Flushing Meadow, 30th Dispatch] Pakistani Chief Representative Khan, in a speech at the UN ceremony authorizing Pakistan's formal accession to the United Nations today, expressed dissatisfaction with the major powers' failure to agree. He said that two years have passed since the end of World War II, but the world is still seeking peace, and it seems difficult to grasp. The major countries that concentrated their resources and intelligence to win the war seem unable to establish a frank and sincere agreement on the basis of peace. On behalf of my government, I assure the United Nations that Pakistan will do its utmost to promote better understanding between countries, to achieve and maintain lasting peace. He continued that, in fact, Pakistan is a part of India, and the latter was a signatory to the Treaty of Versailles and a founding member of the League of Nations. Therefore, Pakistan is not a new member of the United Nations, but a successor to a founding member. Although Pakistan's participation in the United Nations is only a formality, we believe that this represents Pakistan's trust in the principles of the United Nations.

### Truman Urges Congress to Aid Europe Vandenberg Responds First Decides to Convene the Senate Foreign Relations Committee Immediately

[This Newspaper News] New York, 30th Broadcast: Washington News, Senator Vandenberg will convene the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on November 10 to consider the urgent issue of European aid. Vandenberg said: The current issue is actually the question of whether mankind can continue to survive freely. Truman's proposed European relief plan is different from the Marshall Plan, but there are various similar factors between the two, only the emphasis is slightly different.

[Associated Press, Washington, 29th Dispatch] President Truman today called on congressional leaders to promote the European aid plan, but said that the issue of convening a special session of Congress remains to be decided. After the President and congressional leaders held a meeting at the White House, they hurriedly summoned a group of reporters and issued the following statement: He has asked the Appropriations and Foreign Relations Committees of both the Senate and the House of Representatives to meet as soon as possible to discuss the urgent need to aid Western Europe. If the committees unanimously agree to convene a special session of Congress, there will be no problem in convening it. In any case, his position remains unchanged, that is, he will convene it when necessary.

European Aid Funds Will Soon Be Exhausted

The existing European aid funds can only support until December 1, and that is the minimum amount. After that, the aid funds will be exhausted. Before March 31 next year, another 580 million US dollars must be allocated to assist France, Italy, and Austria. This amount is already so small that it cannot be reduced any further. He cannot use any administrative power to allocate this money. The current situation in the United Kingdom does not seem as serious as in the above three countries. The President also replied to a reporter's question that Belgium and the Netherlands were able to cope with their needs in the past, and it seems that they can still do so in the future.

France and Italy Face the Most Urgent Crisis

(United Press, Washington, 30th Dispatch) President Truman openly expressed his concerns when discussing with congressional leaders, saying that unless France and Italy can get emergency aid from the United States, they will be swallowed up by communism. However, it is futile to convene Congress without first obtaining a guarantee of support for his plan. Congressional leaders doubt whether the Appropriations and Foreign Relations Committees of the Senate and the House of Representatives can complete the necessary research before December 1, because the members are now scattered all over the world, and many are personally investigating in Europe. It is questionable whether they can be recalled before December 15.

[Reuters, Washington, 29th Dispatch] According to the members who participated in the White House talks, Truman failed to obtain definite support from Republican leaders.

Secretary Marshall Gave a Detailed Report

Democratic Senator Lucas said that Secretary of State Marshall and Undersecretary Lovett gave detailed reports on the European economic situation at the White House meeting. House Republican Leader Halleck strongly stated that the Republican Party did not accept any specific agreement at today's meeting. Marshall left the White House after the members, and seemed very excited, but he refused to answer all questions from reporters.

### Partial Reorganization of the British Cabinet Cripps Appointed Minister of Economic Affairs Greenwood Retires, Morrison Succeeds Him

(Reuters, London, 29th Dispatch) Prime Minister Attlee announced at midnight today the appointment of President of the Board of Trade Cripps as the new Minister of Economic Affairs, and transferred Secretary for Overseas Trade Wilson to succeed him as President of the Board of Trade. 10 Downing Street also announced the resignation of Minister Without Portfolio Greenwood. Cripps will take over the responsibility of directing domestic economic policy, which was previously held by Lord President of the Council Morrison.

The Minister of Economic Affairs has only a few staff members. In terms of work, he will be assisted by the original Central Planning Economic Bureau, Economic Intelligence Office, and the Economic Section of the Cabinet Secretariat. In addition, a Cabinet Economic Planning Committee will be established, chaired by Prime Minister Attlee, to handle major issues of domestic and foreign economic policy. Greenwood's resignation is the result of Prime Minister Attlee's desire to have younger members participate in the cabinet to replace older cabinet members. Morrison will succeed Greenwood as Minister Without Portfolio. Other cabinet changes, including the retirement of some older cabinet members, are expected to be announced on the weekend.

According to this agency's political reporter, Cripps' appointment as Minister of Economic Affairs, responsible for the unified command of economic policy, has the power to supervise and control the departments of commerce, supply, labor, fuel, power, and transportation. He will also work closely with Chancellor of the Exchequer Dalton, but he is in a parallel position to the Chancellor. Until now, the United Kingdom's economic planning has been the responsibility of two committees, one responsible for the domestic economy, chaired by Morrison, and one responsible for the foreign economy, chaired by Attlee. In the future, these two committees will technically still be chaired by Attlee, but in practice, they will usually be chaired by Cripps. Foreign Secretary Bevin will also join the Design Committee as a member.

### Soviet Writer Insults Truman The United States Protests to the Soviet Union Molotov Has Given a Straightforward Reply

[Associated Press, Washington, 29th Dispatch] The State Department announced today that a Soviet writer wrote an article insulting President Truman, comparing the President to Hitler. The United States protested, but was rejected by the Soviet government.

Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov replied that the Soviet government could not be responsible for this kind of writing, and could not accept the protest lodged by the Ambassador.

### MacArthur's Directive for Increased Coal Production; Japanese Cabinet to Formulate Concrete Measures; Aiming for an Annual Production of 40 Million Tons in Five Years

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 30th] The Japanese government, having received directives from General MacArthur's headquarters regarding increased coal production, convened a cabinet meeting today to discuss concrete measures. The results of the meeting included decisions to:  prohibit producers from secretly selling directly to consumers; maintain coal prices without change; provide special allocations of materials to highly efficient producers as an incentive; and adopt a 24-hour, three-shift system for labor.

In addition, the Ministry of Labor proposed reducing or waiving the increased portion of income tax from increased production labor, to be borne by businesses, but the Ministry of Commerce and Industry opposed the burden being borne by businesses and advocated tax exemption. This opinion was not accepted by the Ministry of Finance, and it was decided to postpone the matter to the next cabinet meeting for further discussion. Furthermore, Minister of Commerce and Industry Mizutani, speaking on the directives from General MacArthur's headquarters, stated: The goal is to reach a production of 40 million tons by 1952, with an annual increase of 2 to 3 million tons. However, to increase coal production, national management is absolutely necessary, for the following reasons: planned production is essential; the actual situation can be fully understood; policy and actual circumstances can be aligned; and the allocation of materials and labor can be smoothly executed.

### Conspiracy to Expand Labor Unrest; Ten Arrested; Order to Reorganize the Department Store Union in Three Districts

[Our Newspaper News] The public security authorities discovered that there were hidden elements of a criminal gang within the department store worker's union in the three districts. These elements were colluding with criminal gangs within the electricity and French-owned power unions to expand the situation. Recently, they were instigating New Sun Sun Company employees, exploiting the Lee Chak case to incite a general strike. As a result, yesterday morning, personnel were dispatched to arrest the main members of the union, including Chen Shih-chun (National Goods Worker), Ting Sheng-ya (Wing On Worker), Wang Shou-quan (National Goods Worker), Liang Ren- (Wing On Worker), Bu Bu-yun (Sincere Worker), Ma Chia-ching (Sincere Worker), Sun Shou-kang (Sincere Worker), Chou Heng (Little Luzon Worker), Mi Ren (Great New Worker), and Yao Chu-ming (Union Secretary), totaling ten people. They will be interrogated and dealt with according to the law.

The Social Affairs Police Bureau issued an order to the department store worker's union in the three districts late last night, instructing them to immediately cease activities and send personnel for reorganization. The original order stated: "It has been discovered that since the cracking down of the communist bandit organization in this city, according to investigation results, many responsible persons of the union are also colluding with the bandit party, frequently causing disturbances. The previous labor unrest in the industry was all instigated by them, endangering public security and confusing people's minds. It is truly necessary to quickly reorganize. We are dispatching Hsiang Sheng and 25 others as reorganization personnel, and designating Bureau Specialist Fang Min as the reorganization instructor. In addition to issuing separate orders, we are attaching a copy of the list of reorganization personnel, ordering you to comply and await reorganization. This order is issued." Attached is the list of reorganization personnel: Hsiang Sheng, Chiang Nung-lung, Chi Kuang, Chen Chen-wei, Yao Cho-jen, Chin Hou-kun, Lei Yi-ming, Liang Teh-hsiang, Wang Shih-hua, Wang Li-men, Sung Ping-wei, Lin Yi-yi, Yang Po-hsiung, Chien Kuei-fu, Yeh Chun-lin, Tai Li-tang, Wang Chia-lin, Lu Nien-cheng, Lung Tao, Yang Hung-cheng, Hsia Shun-fa, Chu Chien-feng, Tai Teh-kang, Ma Teh-piao, Chang Hsing-fang.

### Social Affairs Bureau Refuses the Union's Demands; French Tramway Leaves the Factory Last Night; Partial Work Stoppage by Employees of the Electric Power Company

[Our Newspaper News] British trams resumed full operation yesterday. Under the persuasion of some union directors and supervisors, French-owned water and electricity workers also dispatched one red public bus and two Route 2 trams at 8:30 last night, but they were immediately driven back. According to the director of the Social Affairs Bureau, French companies may resume work today.

There are a total of seventeen directors and supervisors in the French-owned Water and Electricity Company's industrial union, twelve of whom the Social Affairs Bureau considers to be instigators of the labor unrest and has requested the company to dismiss. There are also four other workers whom the company has been requested to dismiss. The Social Affairs Bureau will also reorganize and restructure the union within days. French-owned water and electricity workers held a general meeting in the Lu Chia Wan factory yesterday morning, attended by more than 400 workers. The four directors and supervisors ordered to be dismissed, namely Ma Kuo-hua, Chang Hua-lin, Chou Feng-lin, and Liu Chen-ming, also attended. A joint declaration of the sixteen dismissed employees was also posted in the factory. Union Chairman Chu Chun-hsin, who had already gone into hiding, also had a letter to the workers posted on the wall. As a result of the meeting, the workers submitted the following conditions for resuming work to the Social Affairs Bureau: Release the three arrested workers, Tsou Pao-jung, Hsiung Tao-hung, and Tao Ah-er; guarantee not to reorganize the union; and rescind the dismissal order for the sixteen employees. The Social Affairs Bureau did not accept this. Director Wu stated that the Social Affairs Bureau has no power to release the arrested workers. Regarding the non-reorganization of the union, it can be considered if the workers resume work immediately.

The families of the arrested workers of the electric power company went to the old factory on Fei Lun Road, the Hai Fang Road substation, and the Yangchow Road substation yesterday to cause a commotion. Workers there gradually staged partial work stoppages. By 2:00 PM, more than 600 people had stopped working. The Yangpu General Factory was not affected. At 5:00 PM, union advisor Fan Tsai-kuei, along with union leader Wu Shih-shen, visited the director of the Social Affairs Bureau to report the situation and discuss countermeasures. According to Director Wu's statement to reporters: This worker's work stoppage was caused by someone deliberately spreading rumors that the government would continue to arrest workers. The Social Affairs Bureau immediately posted a notice at the company stating that, except for those listed in the previously announced list who have not yet been arrested, all other workers are protected and can work with peace of mind, and should not believe the rumors.

### Four Public Utility Unions Resolved Yesterday to Demand Changes to the Index Calculation Method

[Our Newspaper News] Four of the six major public utility industrial unions in this city held a joint meeting yesterday. Those present included Chou Chang-chiang and Cheng Yang-tien from British Tramway; Chou Fu-chiang, Chang Yi-kang, and Yang Chung-fang from British Waterworks; Chang Tzu-heng, Chang Sen, Yueh Chia-chin, Chin Yu-lin, and Lu Tsung-jun from British Gas; and Liang Yung-chang, Ni Hsi-jung, Chang Wan-kang, and Chou Chung-ching from American Telephone, totaling more than ten people. American Power and French Water and Electricity did not participate due to recent labor unrest. The meeting was chaired by Liang Yung-chang and resolved: Express dissatisfaction with the September worker's cost of living index published by the municipal government. The cost of living index should not be based on the prices of rationed goods, as workers cannot rely entirely on rationed goods to live. For example, coal briquettes and cooking oil have never been received. The rationed rice is not only insufficient in quantity but also of extremely poor quality, mixed with a lot of powder and bran. Therefore, it is requested that the municipal government and the Federation of Labor Unions use actual market prices when compiling the index. Due to the Mid-Autumn Festival, half-month's wages were issued in advance, originally scheduled for one-time deduction. However, because the cost of living index was unexpectedly low, it is requested that the company management, based on the spirit of labor-management cooperation, deduct the amount in two installments. Regarding the proposal to establish joint worker welfare programs among the six public utility companies, a written request was sent to the company management last week to send representatives to discuss the matter together with the union. However, the company management has not yet responded. It was decided that the responsible persons of each union will submit a request to the relevant company authorities separately tomorrow. Expressing regret that the labor unrest at American Power and French Water and Electricity has affected the entire union organization and the welfare of all workers due to a few bad elements, expressing great sympathy for the workers.

### Credit Cooperatives Lose Their Essence Without Issuing Checks; Yu Nan-chiu, Chiang Chien-pai, and Pu Ching File Lawsuit

Shanghai's credit cooperatives gathered yesterday to unanimously express their opposition to the reported Ministry of Finance ban on credit cooperatives issuing checks. They elected Yu Nan-chiu and Chiang Chien-pai as representatives to go to Peking for discussions and prepare for administrative litigation. According to Chiang Chien-pai: Credit cooperatives are legally entitled to issue checks. According to Article 3, Paragraph 4 of the Cooperative Law: "Credit cooperatives, in order to promote the circulation of finance, shall lend necessary funds for production or manufacturing to members and accept deposits from members."

Article 2 of the Banking Law states: "The term 'banking business' as used in this law refers to the following items: (1) Receiving various types of deposits, (2) ... (3) Handling various types of loans...." Referring to the provisions of the two laws above, it is sufficient to prove that credit cooperatives are legally engaged in monetary business. Only the monetary business of credit cooperatives is limited to their members. Their status as a monetary business is completely certain. Article 18 of the Banking Law stipulates that "Anyone who regularly receives currency or funds, regardless of whether the method of receiving is by issuing checks, deposit slips, receipts, account books, promissory notes, or other similar evidentiary documents, shall be deemed to be engaged in banking business." Checks, deposit slips, receipts, account books, and promissory notes are all considered banking business. Even if credit cooperatives do not use checks, they must still use deposit slips, account books, etc., which is still banking business. Therefore, no matter how it is interpreted, the fact that credit cooperatives are monetary businesses cannot be denied. Being monetary businesses, they can naturally issue checks. The issuance of checks by credit cooperatives involves three types of laws: Cooperative Law, Banking Law, and Negotiable Instruments Law. The Ministry of Finance cannot disregard the Cooperative Law on which credit cooperatives are based and hastily assume that credit cooperatives are non-monetary businesses that cannot issue checks. Moreover, checks are an important tool for modern financial circulation. The greater the financial credit, the wider the use of checks, and the greater the need for them. If credit cooperatives cannot issue checks, then credit cooperatives will lose their essence, and the provisions of the Cooperative Law regarding the establishment of credit cooperatives would be meaningless.

### More Than Decade-Old Lost Child Case; Orphanage Requests Retrial

[Our Newspaper News] More than a decade ago, the orphanage association took in a lost child who had come to Shanghai from Kiukiang.

### Anti-Corruption Case Investigated All Day Yesterday; Li Cho-min and Eleven Others Summoned; Prosecutor Discovers New Evidence; All But Lu Han-chin Ordered to Be Released on Bail

Then, he silently sat in a corner of the waiting room, chain-smoking, and occasionally using a newspaper to cover his face.

At noon, Prosecutor Ho did not have lunch, and Li and others also bought biscuits to eat. At around 3:00 PM, Li Cho-min was summoned and questioned for about an hour. The case started at 9:30 AM and was not completed until 8:00 PM. The court ordered Lu Han-chin to be taken back, and Li Cho-min, Tung Cheng-tao, and Hou Ai-chang to each post a written guarantee of 500 million yuan. Chen Kuang-pei posted a written guarantee of 300 million yuan. The others each posted guarantees with two shareholders. As for the content of the investigation, Prosecutor Ho declined to disclose it. However, it was heard that it involved a very wide range and that some new evidence was not found in the confidential letters but was discovered during the prosecutor's investigation.

### Li Ze Still Sentenced to Three Years; Expressed Disagreement in Court

[Reported by This Newspaper] Li Ze, the General Manager of the New-New Company, was accused of serving as a director of the puppet merchants' association and suspected of being a traitor. He was previously sentenced to three years in prison by the High Court. After the Supreme Court sent the case back for retrial, he was sentenced again by the High Court yesterday. More than one hundred employees of the New-New Company arrived in court to listen to the proceedings around 9:00 AM. At 9:20 AM, Judge Xiao, along with two judges, Chen Zhensheng and Han Shuzhi, took their seats and brought Li Ze to the court. Li was wearing a light gray "派力司" (Pallis) long gown and glasses on his nose. Judge Xiao stood up and read out the main text of the judgment: "Li Ze, colluding with an enemy country, plotting to resist this country, sentenced to three years in prison, deprived of civil rights for three years, and property confiscated, except for a reasonable amount for the family's necessary living expenses."

Judgment Rationale

After sitting down, he briefly stated the reasons for the judgment: "The enemy established the Merchants' Association to purchase and control materials. The defendant's position as a director of the association was clearly detrimental to this country and beneficial to the enemy. As for the contact with the Military Intelligence Bureau, why was it not stated in the first trial, but only after the retrial? This raises doubts. The original sentence of three years is appropriate, so the original sentence is upheld. If you disagree, you can apply to the Supreme Court for review within ten days of receiving the judgment." After hearing this, Li expressed his disagreement. The defense attorney requested the court to allow bail, submitting a written request for a ruling. Li was still taken back into custody.

### Shooting Fights on Nanjing Road; One Robber Killed, Two Children Injured

[Reported by This Newspaper] Jin Xingyuan, the old clerk of the Da Mao Textile Enterprise Company at 264 Beijing Road, second floor, was ordered to withdraw 10 million yuan in legal tender from the An Yu Qian Zhuang in Xingren Lane, Ningbo Road, around 3:00 PM yesterday. He took it to Zhang Bingfa's tin shop at 139 Tianjin Road to buy tinplate. While he was inquiring about the price, two robbers jumped out from behind, trying to seize the legal tender. Jin struggled and was hit in the back of the head with a pistol butt. The robbers then fled with the money. Despite his injuries, Jin followed closely behind. When they reached the entrance of Xiangkang Lane, a news vendor, Feng Guanlong, tried to stop the robbers. The robbers fired a shot into the sky. When they fled to the vicinity of the Nanjing Hotel on Shanxi Road, a car transporting money from the Foch Road branch of the Guangzhong Bank happened to be there. The bodyguard, Hu Longfu, saw the situation and jumped down to chase them. The robbers fired two shots in a row, but fortunately, they all missed. When they reached the intersection of Shanxi Road and Nanjing Road, one robber fled south on Shanxi Road, while the other fled west along Nanjing Road. The bodyguard, together with the police officer from post number 1542 nearby, fired three shots in front of the Guanxin Hat Shop at 460 Nanjing Road. The robber also fired two shots in return, but none hit. At the same time, the patrol police chief number 2044 from the Lao Zha sub-bureau also joined the battle, firing two shots in a row, hitting one robber in the left chest and right waist. He fell to the ground and died. Five million yuan of the original stolen money was found in his possession. When the bullets were flying, two apprentices, Chen Bajin (17 years old, from Changzhou) and Xin Xiaogou (18 years old, from Changzhou), from Liu Yongxing's engraving shop at 777 Fangbang Road, were hit by stray bullets in their right and left calves, respectively. They, along with the injured victim Jin Xingyuan, were sent to the hospital. The robber's body was taken to the coroner's office for examination, and the other robber is still being pursued.

### Yuan Ludeng's Retrial Sentence; Reduced to Seven Years; Smiles Upon Hearing the Verdict

[Reported by This Newspaper] Yuan Ludeng, one of the "Three Old Men of Shanghai," was accused of serving as the director of the puppet Rice and Grain Control Committee and other positions. He was previously sentenced to life imprisonment by the High Court, but the Supreme Court sent the case back for retrial, which has now concluded. The case was sentenced again in the High Court yesterday. At 9:40 AM, Judge Liu Yugui, along with two judges, Chen Zhensheng and Qiu Huanying, and prosecutor Yang Shoucheng, took their seats and brought Yuan to the court. Yuan was wearing a dark gray "派力司" (Pallis) long gown and round-rimmed tortoiseshell glasses on his nose. Judge Liu stood up and read out the main text of the judgment: "Yuan Ludeng, colluding with an enemy country, plotting to resist this country, sentenced to seven years in prison, deprived of civil rights for seven years, and property confiscated, except for a reasonable amount for the family's necessary living expenses." Then he sat down and explained the reasons for the judgment: "The defendant served as the director of the Rice and Grain Control Committee, which he himself admitted, and the Supreme Court has no doubts about this. The reason for the reduced sentence on retrial is that the defendant rescued many underground workers during the occupation of Shanghai, and Huang Hanzhi, Yu Bingjian, and others testified in court, which can be believed. Furthermore, the defendant has been engaged in charitable work in Shanghai for many years, and the circumstances warrant a reduction. If you disagree, you can apply to the Supreme Court for review within ten days of receiving the judgment." Yuan smiled and nodded upon hearing the verdict, saying "Good, good!" After requesting permission to see his family, he was taken back into custody.

### Shen Bao Scholarship Fund; Fundraising Period Expires

This time, to celebrate the 75th anniversary of the founding of this newspaper and the publication of the 25,000th issue, we specially organized the "Reader Scholarship Fund." On the one hand, it is for celebration, and on the other hand, it is for relief. Celebration is "adding flowers to the brocade," and relief is "sending charcoal in the snow." Now, we are combining these two extremes, merging them into the same goal, that is, we are celebrating our anniversary by "rescuing those who are out of school," and at the same time, we are rescuing a large number of out-of-school youth by "celebrating our anniversary." From August 22nd to September 30th, we worked hard for the "Reader Scholarship Fund" for forty days. Every day, we appealed in the newspaper and ran around in the scorching sun, but we had a common goal, which was to rescue those who are out of school.

Time passed quickly, and forty days passed in a blink of an eye. The deadline for raising donations for the "Reader Scholarship Fund" has finally arrived, but the work of reviewing and awarding will continue for a considerable period of time. At the same time, we must also review the past achievements as a reference for the future.

Finally, we wish many young people who have received our help that they can work harder to study and research, so that morality, intelligence, and physical fitness can leap forward!

### City Council Adjourns; Will Reconvene in One Month; Councilors' Opinions Differ; Hatton Garden Case Reserved

[Reported by This Newspaper] The Municipal Council's fourth general meeting held a seven-day meeting, which adjourned at 8:00 PM last night. The adjourned meeting will be held in one month, and the main task is to review the city's budget for the 37th year. As for the cases discussed and resolved in this general meeting, those that are not very important but are time-sensitive will be handled by the relevant agencies first, and then ratified at the adjourned meeting. Those that are relatively important but not time-sensitive will be left for discussion at the adjourned meeting.

The most heatedly discussed proposal at the seventh meeting of the general assembly yesterday was the issue of requisitioning Hatton Garden to be converted into a park. Regarding this proposal, it can be divided into two parts: one is the mayor's submission for discussion, "David George Hatton's presentation of the donation of real estate to the Senate for consideration and reply." The other is the "Proposal to requisition the garden as a permanent park for the city" submitted by Fang Rusheng and 58 other senators. Councilors have different opinions on this case. Zhang Nai first explained the reasons for the requisition on behalf of the four groups, saying: According to national land policy, private individuals should not have such a large garden. Article 208 of the Land Law stipulates that the state may expropriate private land in accordance with the provisions of this law for the needs of transportation undertakings, public utilities, public health, etc. Requisitioning Hatton Garden requires less cost and is easier to succeed. The garden covers an area of 170 acres and only requires 12 billion yuan. Lu Shidao continued, saying that the City Council should not rashly take responsibility for this case. We have not yet seen how Mrs. Hatton's will actually states. If George Hatton donates 15 acres, will he no longer be asked to lend any more? Wu Zhengque opposed the entire requisition, saying that although there are regulations in the Land Law, attention should be paid to the point that "it should be limited to what is necessary for its business." Is it "necessary" to requisition Hatton Garden? Deng Chuan praised the establishment of a library on 15 acres of land. Jiang Hao suggested that the handling method be reserved. Finally,

The Mayor Explained

That the municipal government had consulted with George Hatton in order to implement the councilors' resolution, but the other party refused to rent it. Therefore, I had to report to the City Council for a decision. I believe that since George Hatton is willing to donate land and automatically build a library, the municipal government can be said to be effortless, so it can concentrate its efforts to negotiate the requisition of the racecourse, which is more beneficial to us. Later, Speaker Pan reported that the council had never passed a resolution on "requisitioning." The resolution of the first general meeting was "leasing," and the third general meeting was a proposal. There are the words "requesting a loan" in the proposal, but the resolution was in accordance with the resolution of the first general meeting. As a result, after the General Assembly voted, all the Mayor's submission for deliberation and the Councilors' temporary motions were "reserved."

Case of Selecting Education Director Reserved; Municipal Teachers College Attacked Again

[Reported by This Newspaper] The council yesterday discussed several more temporary proposals. Chen Boliang and Chen Baotai proposed "Requesting the Mayor to quickly select a Director of Education for the city to improve the city's education," according to Chen Boliang's explanation, that the city's educational administration has been abnormally neglected for two years. Please ask the Mayor to quickly select a person of high moral standing and rich experience in educational administration to take office.

In addition to mentioning this case, Chen Baotai also submitted evidence again to expose the Municipal Teachers College's false reporting of the number of students and classes, with a very激昂 attitude. Later, Mayor Wu explained that the appointment of the Education Director should be handled by the Executive Yuan through the Ministry of Education. As for the investigation of corruption, the municipal government has a responsibility to handle it. If it can be verified, it guarantees a thorough and severe investigation. The withdrawal of this proposal is requested.

Acting Education Director Li said that he admitted that there have been problems with the city's education in the past two years, but that some events cannot be blamed entirely on the Education Bureau. I will never compete for the position of the new Director. Finally, regarding the case of the Municipal Teachers College, he repeatedly stated that Principal Dong Renjian did not engage in corruption.

Final Resolution: Chen Boliang's proposal was "reserved," and the case of the Municipal Teachers College was sent to the municipal government for investigation and severe punishment according to law.

Demolition of Houses on Tianmu Road; Decision to Implement in Stages Within Six Months

[Reported by This Newspaper] Regarding the demolition of old houses along Tianmu Road to widen the road, it was originally decided to demolish them before the 15th of October.

### Changzhou Uncovers Secret Bandit and Communist Organizations; Overlapping Secret Rooms, Freely Opening and Closing, Like Honglian Temple; A Large Number of Documents Found in Chicken Coops; Now Following Clues

[Reported from Wujin on the 28th] The district chief of the sixth district in the eastern township of this county, Guan Jie, recently led self-defense team members in the village of Xiaoliu, uncovering a secret organization led by Sun Wenxuan and Communist forces. The simple, twisted story reads like a legend of Honglian Temple. Here is an account of what happened:

Bandit problems have been common in the area, the local office of the director of the Bandit and Puppet Wu Nan Garrison, Lu Daonan, frequents the area. The district office recently received reports and clues, learning that Sun Wenxuan in the village of Xiaoliu was harboring Bandit and Puppet forces. On the night of the 25th of this month, he led over 20 members of the self-defense squadron and special agents, armed, to the village of Zhuji on Xiaoliu. The villagers were all asleep. Without a sound, they confined the tenant farmers in one room and searched the house. Only an old man lived in the house, named Sun Guifu, who was already seventy years old, with poor eyesight and hearing. The rest were tenant farmers. The house was large, with over ten rooms, arranged in a winding fashion. After searching for over an hour, there were no suspicious signs. Gradually reaching the kitchen, they found a side door. Opening it led to a small alley. There was a locked double room a short distance away. They broke in. The room was fully furnished with a bed and cabinet. Then, behind the bed, they discovered a secret room with a rope mechanism to open and close it. There was a wooden board similar to a door or window on the wall. Pulling it open allowed only one person to enter. The room was pitch black, with only one bed and one stool. The bed curtains were all red. After searching, they found items for arson and ammunition. They also found assembly rope. The secret room door could be opened and closed freely, like the flexible mechanism in Honglian Temple. At 3 a.m., they summoned the local Baojia head and most of the villagers woke up from their dreams, coming to witness. They were all amazed. On the 26th, more personnel were dispatched to move all the furniture in the room and inspect it one by one. They found a large number of secret documents and a large number of grain requisition lists in a chicken coop. There were also anti-currency and many rifle bullets. It is said that there is still a secret cellar in the house, containing a lot of military supplies and firearms. The district office is following the clues. The search continued on the 27th and 28th.

### Inspecting Hangzhou Bay

[Our Newspaper Hangzhou 29th Dispatch] By chance, our reporter and Mr. Tian Han were introduced to Mr. Xu Huijun, the chief of the Hangzhou Engineering Office of the First District Bureau of the Highway Administration of the Ministry of Communications. Through his introduction, we also met Mr. Liang Qiang, the director of the First District Bureau, Cheng Lin, a technician of the Highway Administration, Chen Zujun, the chief engineer of the District Bureau, Peng Shude, the chief of the Engineering Section, and Mr. Lai Zishu, an engineer. They were going to inspect the entire highway of Hangzhou Bay. Mr. Tian Han was the first to volunteer to join this trip, and the reporter was also invited to join.

The First District Bureau of the Highway Administration is in charge of the highways of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces. The highway transportation between Nanjing, Shanghai, and Hangzhou depends entirely on their efforts. Hangzhou Bay normally starts from the Jin Sinang Bridge on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway, passing through Zhapu, Haiyan, Haining, Hangzhou, Xiaoshan, Shaoxing, Baiguan, and reaching Guanhaiwei. Opening the map of the Republic of China, it happens to be on the edge of a small corner at the bottom of the eastern end of this begonia leaf. This is the Oriental Grand Port planned by Mr. Sun Yat-sen, the gap where the enemy - Japan - first invaded East China and Central China, and also the trading ground for civilian commerce. We first depart from Hangzhou.

Crossing the Qiantang River Bridge

Passing through Xiaoshan to Shaoxing. Two sections of the Qiantang River Bridge's motor vehicle lane are filled with wood. Director Liang Qiang, a highly experienced 61-year-old, believes that more asphalt and paint should be applied to prevent it from being destroyed. We are taking the old Xiaoshan road, which has some bumps. After passing Xiaoshan, the road becomes much flatter. The Xiaoshao Highway was originally a famous and good highway, but the bridges are still temporarily made of wood. On the road, we saw the farmers still climbing on the waterwheels, stepping on them to pump water into their fields. I looked again at the parched crops, and then at the river next to the road. In such an environment, the crops should be saved, but because the supply of manpower is insufficient and the water demand is too large, the harvest of these rice crops will not be very good. Shaoxing is currently building a stone towpath to facilitate boats pulling cables. After arriving in Shaoxing, the reporter and Mr. Tian Han visited the ancient Yue city.

One of Shaoxing's three famous products, tin foil, is still being smuggled very actively. If it is not carried on the car, it is carried on the boat, which is really difficult to prevent. It is said that most of these smugglers are wearing military uniforms. Another famous product, rice wine, has been produced less recently due to heavy wine taxes. Moreover, because Shaoxing people are making Shaoxing wine everywhere, foreign sales have also been affected. Speaking of freshwater fish, it is relatively quiet recently; winter and spring are the prosperous periods. Mr. Tian and the old reporter toured the streets, trying their best to look for traces of the King of Yue who once slept on firewood and tasted gall, just like searching for ancient treasures. They also wanted to see this famous area where talents are born, and the former residences of the great educator Cai Yuanpei and the great writer Lu Xun. On the street, there were only a few small bookstores with not many books inside. If you want to buy some local products, apart from fragrant cakes, there is nothing else to buy. Many items are foreign, and the price is more expensive than in Shanghai and Hangzhou. The famous Yue Opera here is not as good as the performances in Shanghai. We went to East Lake for a遊玩. Mr. Tian抢着 wanted to row a boat. The bottom of this kind of boat is very narrow and is rowed by both hands and feet. If you are not careful, it will capsize. I heard that East Lake is very deep. Fortunately, he is skilled. He visited Tao Gong Cave and then Xiantao Cave. Although most of it is man-made, the cliffs are tens of feet high, which is quite interesting. It is a pity that the houses built by the lake are mostly damaged.

From Shaoxing, we went to Baiguan, and the highway is still very good.

An aerial view of the Qiantang River (photo by Xu Bochuan)

Arriving at the Baiguan Ferry

is the location of Cao'e Town in Cao'e River. The Cao'e River was originally called Shun River, which is the "Shun" in Yao and Shun. At that time, he controlled the water and diverted the river flow into Hangzhou Bay, so it was used to commemorate him. Later, because of the filial daughter Cao E, who threw herself into the river to save her father, it was renamed to its current name. Crossing the river is Baiguan Town. There is a large temple in the town, and many houses are supported by stone pillars, which shows the long history of the building. However, the temple has not been整理, and it is凌乱 and惨败, which is not the phenomenon that should be present when commemorating the ancestors. Baiguan Town is about three miles long, and there are also many shops selling 洋货. Most of the shops sell salty seafood, because it is near the sea. The engineers are planning to restore

Baiguan to Zhouxiang

The highway. If the road is通, it will no longer be necessary to borrow the old Hang甬 Railway, and this road can lead to Guanhaiwei, and from Guanhaiwei to Yin County, which will bring many conveniences to commercial transportation and also have great values for national defense. They are carefully planning how to standardize this highway and how to reduce curves without the highway having to accommodate bridges.

Returning to Shaoxing from Baiguan渡江, I also cared about Shaoxing's grain this year. I asked the local people, and they told me that Shaoxing is a grain-deficient county. This year is乾旱. The fields near the river are fine, but the fields not near the river are finished. Shaoxing does not have any new-style hotels. There are mosquitoes and bedbugs in the旅店, and Mr. Tian and the reporter did not sleep well all night.

### NANTUNG NOTES: THE COUNTY GOVERNMENT NEGOTIATES LOANS OF 400 TO 500 MILLION YUAN; THE TEMPORARY CONSULTATIVE ASSEMBLY ORGANIZES AN INSPECTION TEAM; REPORTER ADOPTS AN ANTI-BLOCKADE APPROACH

### JINGJIANG LACKS ACCUMULATED GRAIN ORDER COUNTY MAGISTRATE TO COMPENSATE

[Our Newspaper Zhenjiang 30th Telegraph] Zhang Zhuan, the Magistrate of Jingjiang County, levied a 10% surcharge on grain during the 1946 land tax collection. Without approval, he arbitrarily converted it into cash. After the collection, he did not purchase grain for storage in a timely manner but instead deposited the cash in commercial firms to earn interest. Later, due to severe price fluctuations, it was impossible to replenish the grain, resulting in a shortage of several hundred shi of the collected amount. After an investigation by the Jiangsu Provincial Land Tax and Grain Management Office, Order No. 2758 from the 36th Army was used to quickly purchase and store the grain, and the County Magistrate Zhang Zhuan was held responsible for compensating the missing amount. Furthermore, Zhang Zhuan recently ordered the departments of the County Government not to directly release news but to have the news liaison officer be solely responsible. He has appointed Zhang Lintang as the news liaison officer of Jingjiang County, Jiangsu Province. This person published an advertisement in the Jingjiang Daily (September 25th), which roughly stated: "To the special correspondents of various newspapers outside the county: The news liaison mechanism of this county has been established under orders. In addition to establishing close contact with various newspapers, news agencies, and news practitioners in this county, all special correspondents of various newspapers outside the county, whose names and addresses are unknown, have not yet been contacted. To promote the development of the news industry and establish contact, it is hoped that the special correspondents responsible for various newspapers outside the county will come to the Personnel Office of the County Government for a discussion or inform us of their names, addresses, and the newspapers they are responsible for so that we can contact them. Zhang Lintang, News Liaison Officer of Jingjiang County, Jiangsu Province." It is learned that local news circles believe that this measure has the suspicion of blocking news from the County Government, so they have unanimously expressed great dissatisfaction.

### Social Affairs Bureau and Other Institutions Collaborate with Major Universities to Plan the Establishment of Student Cafeterias, Aiming to Provide Affordable Goods to Benefit 30,000 Students

[Our Newspaper's Report] Previously, most colleges and universities in the city had economic cafeterias attached to them by the Executive Yuan, which greatly benefited impoverished students. Now, due to the Executive Yuan's closure, the economic cafeterias have successively shut down. At a time when prices are soaring, students' financial burdens are limited. Mayor Wu, recognizing this, decided that the local government should find ways to remedy the situation and plans to establish "Youth Cafeterias" in colleges and universities throughout the city, with the Social Service Department of the Social Affairs Bureau taking charge. These cafeterias will offer affordable supplies such as rice, coal, oil, salt, vegetables, fish, and meat to the schools, so that they will not face increased difficulties due to price fluctuations, and students will not face increased burdens due to expensive goods, preventing malnutrition and ensuring that over 30,000 college and university students in the city receive real benefits. Yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, Wu Kaixian, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, Shen Naizheng, Counselor of the Municipal Government, and Li Ximou, Acting Director of the Police Bureau, jointly convened responsible persons from colleges and universities in the city at the Social Affairs Bureau to discuss implementation matters.

Director Wu, as chairman, elaborated on the importance of establishing Youth Cafeterias, after which representatives from each school successively expressed their opinions. After discussion, the "Brief Rules for Service of the Shanghai Social Service Department's Special Distribution Stations for Affordable Goods for Youth Cafeterias in Colleges and Universities" and "Measures for Distributing Affordable Goods" were approved. Within three days, each school will designate one staff member and student representatives to be responsible for cafeteria matters and will notify the Social Service Department of this list. The Department will then convene the responsible personnel from each school's Youth Cafeteria to discuss all implementation methods. The affordable supplies will be distributed according to a quantitative allocation method, and the local government will be responsible for subsidizing the transportation costs required for the government to purchase supplies from the market. The approved Brief Rules for Service of the Distribution Stations for Affordable Goods for Youth Cafeterias and Measures for Distributing Affordable Goods are transcribed below:

Measures for Distributing Affordable Goods for Youth Cafeterias: This department, for the sake of assisting impoverished students, has specifically established distribution stations in colleges and universities to handle the sale of affordable goods through Youth Cafeterias. Each school's service distribution station is limited to establishing one Youth Cafeteria, except for cases where the various colleges and departments are not located in the same place and are far apart, in which case separate facilities may be established. Schools requesting the allocation of affordable goods must submit a roster of students who will participate in the dining program and must be certified by the school authorities. The distribution methods for various affordable goods will be determined separately by this department. The required quantity of affordable goods for each school's Youth Cafeteria should be calculated based on the need for affordable goods. For the sake of affordable goods, distribution stations will be temporarily established in suitable locations in Huxi, Hongkou, and Jiangwan. It is stipulated that each recipient unit purchase and receive the allocated goods from the designated distribution station from 7:00 AM to 9:00 AM daily. If there are adjustments to the prices of affordable goods, notices will be posted at the distribution stations. Each school's Youth Cafeteria must submit a monthly report to this department on the financial situation, purchasing standards, and other items for verification. Those that are poorly managed will be ordered to rectify the situation or may be reorganized by this department in consultation with the school authorities. If necessary, the allocation may be suspended. The reporting format will be determined separately. These measures will take effect from the date of promulgation.

Brief Rules for Service of the Distribution Stations for Affordable Goods for Youth Cafeterias: Each distribution station will be managed by one employee assigned by the nearest service distribution station. The station address will be based on the principle of utilizing public spaces. The entrance of the distribution station must be marked with the words "Shanghai Social Service Department Special Distribution Station for Affordable Goods for Youth Cafeterias in Colleges and Universities," and the prices of affordable goods must be posted inside the venue. The distribution time is from 7:00 AM to 9:00 AM every day. For the allocation of rice, coal, and other items, payment must first be made to this department to obtain a certificate, which is then used to collect the goods from the distribution station. For the allocation of vegetables, meat, and other items, the goods must be purchased from the distribution station daily using a three-part certificate. The distribution station will stamp the connection lines and the quantity of goods and amount paid on each part, retaining the first and second parts. The first part will be kept at the station for verification, and the second part will be sent to this department weekly along with the payment. The third part will be retained by the purchasing cafeteria as a record. This department will settle accounts with the suppliers of affordable goods once a week. These measures will take effect from the date of promulgation.

### Flour Group Held Two Meetings in a Row Yesterday; Price Negotiation Adopts a Flexible Approach; Factory Flour Agreed to Be 180,000 Yuan Per Bag

[Our Newspaper's Report] Wu Kaixian, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, stated yesterday that when the price of flour in the city fluctuated in February, the Social Affairs Bureau restored the negotiated price of the flour group of the Municipal Price Review Committee. It was originally scheduled to hold a fair price evaluation once a week, but this city is not a wheat-producing area, and all raw materials required by the flour milling industry are dependent on other provinces. Therefore, the evaluation of flour prices is based on the price of wheat at the place of origin. However, the price of wheat at the place of origin has fluctuated greatly recently. If the evaluation is still carried out on a regular basis, coupled with the fluctuating price of wheat, the prices of flour and wheat may easily become disconnected. If the price of wheat at the place of origin is high but the price of flour in the city is low, manufacturers will not be able to import raw materials. Therefore, it has been decided that starting this week, a flexible approach will be adopted for flour price evaluation, and reasonable adjustments will be made at any time to ensure that the prices of raw materials and finished products are not disconnected.

The flour group of the Price Review Committee held its third and fourth review meetings at the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday morning and afternoon, respectively. Both were chaired by Ji Mingzhai, Chief of the Food Department. The matters discussed at the third meeting in the morning were: The Fourth District Flour Industry Trade Union proposed that due to the rising price of wheat, the negotiated price was not enough to cover costs. Before the source of wheat in the city is unblocked and the price of wheat in the interior is not stable, it is proposed to temporarily suspend the flour price negotiation. It was resolved that in order to adapt to the times, flexible price negotiation will be adopted in the future, and this committee will make reasonable evaluations at any time according to the cost and a reasonable profit. Regarding the evaluation of flour prices, it was resolved that the factory flour price would be 180,000 yuan per bag, and the retail price should not exceed 187,000 yuan.

The fourth flour price review meeting continued at 4:00 PM in the afternoon. The chairman reported: The prices evaluated at the third review meeting in the morning have been announced and implemented, and the market price is lower than the limit price. Therefore, the situation is good. The purpose of convening the fourth review meeting this time is to determine the market price for tomorrow (ie, today, October 1st). Retailers should make daily reports on the purchase and sale of flour to prevent malpractices. Matters for discussion: Today (October 1st), the price of factory flour is 180,000 yuan per bag, and the retail price should not exceed 187,000 yuan. If the price of wheat fluctuates, a meeting will be convened at any time to evaluate the price of flour.

### Intense Competition Between Bulls and Bears; Yongsha's Situation Fluctuates

There was a lot of struggle in Chinese stocks yesterday. Yongsha's situation was uncertain under the fierce battle between bulls and bears. There was a fierce dispute between the two sides at the morning close and before the market close in the afternoon. In the end, due to the strange tightness of funds, it was easily forced down by the risk of margin calls. However, small-cap stocks were quite energetic. As a result, compared with the previous closing price, Yongsha, Xinyi, Meiya, Huafeng, Zhongfa Underwear, Jinglun, Tongyi, and Rongchang Zhongyu Hengfeng declined slightly. Xinhua rose to the limit.

Zhongfang fell by a weak 10%. Commerce rose slightly. In terms of deferred delivery stocks, Yongsha, Huafeng, Xinyi, and Meiya declined slightly. There were many rumors about the Securities Finance Corporation in the afternoon market, and the atmosphere was described as revitalizing. Yongsha rose to 275 yuan for immediate delivery and 277 yuan for deferred delivery. In the end, due to the large difference in exchange rates of the National Bank, major shareholders sold off one after another and were forced down to 266 yuan for immediate delivery and 270 yuan for deferred delivery. At this time, there was a fierce dispute between bulls and bears in front of the yarn factory's counter. After the market closed, Weite, numbered 36 and 116, closed the market at prices of 270 yuan and 271 yuan. After the close, shouting prices were flat. As a result, compared with the previous closing price, the immediate delivery stocks Yongsha, Meiya, Xinguang, Jingfu, Zhongfang, and Qinxing rose slightly. Zhabei, Tongyi, Matches, and Jinglun declined slightly. Huafeng, Xinyi, and Hengfeng were flat. Xinhua rose to the limit. In terms of deferred delivery stocks, Yongsha, Xinyi, and Meiya declined slightly. Huafeng was flat. The situation of various old stocks outside the market was relatively stable.

The Ministry's order approved the extension of the implementation period of Article 77 of the Provisional Operating Rules of the Stock Exchange, which pertains to the method of transferring reservations, until the end of December of this year. Starting from New Year's Day next year, all listed companies and manufacturers should list formal stocks and may no longer delay.

The settlement date for the 48th period of deferred transactions coincides with the National Day holiday and should be advanced to October 9th. Deferred delivery for this period will be made until the pre-market close on November 7th. Deferred delivery for the next period will begin on the pre-market start on October 8th and will still be settled on the following Friday.

After the trial period for deferred transactions expired, the Ministries of Finance and Economy ordered that they be temporarily allowed to continue until instructed otherwise by the Executive Yuan.

Soybean cake was loose in Shantou, falling back by 1,000 yuan. The purchase of yellow soybeans by the factory was dull. Local merchants were picking up high-quality goods, and the market was high and stable. The elimination of southern tea beans was light, and the price was flat and weak. Broad beans were still marketable, rising by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan. Customers were still unmoved. Yuan wheat was gradually increasing by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan, and red sorghum customers were firm, rising by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan.

### Inventory Has Been Depleted; Wool Textile Industry Rushes to Rescue Raw Materials

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Shanghai Wool Textile Industry Association, due to the shortage of raw materials and the interruption of production, specially convened a board meeting yesterday and invited reporters. At the meeting, Ge Jiec臣, Ye Fokang, and others, standing directors of the association, gave speeches one after another, stating that the government's wool quota each time only covers 15% of the industry's needs. The raw materials stored in each factory have now been depleted. Therefore, they urgently hope that the government will: Grant licenses for wool that has arrived at the port and has been paid for. Grant licenses for wool that has been contracted and paid for. At the same time, they want to relax the future wool import quota to avoid the risk of the industry shutting down. The association has now established a raw materials rescue committee and decided to send representatives to Beijing within days to appeal to the relevant ministries and commissions to solve the raw materials crisis, creating panic.

### The Textile Construction Company Suspends Cotton Cloth Allocation; Cloth Merchants Request Reinstatement of Allotment; Textile Construction Agrees to Reconsider After Explanation from Merchants

[Our Newspaper] According to Vice General Manager Wu of the China Textile Construction Company, suspending the allocation rights of over two hundred cloth merchants is actually beneficial to the entire cloth merchant industry. Indiscriminately reinstating the allocation rights of cloth businesses that have already been suspended, without distinguishing between right and wrong, would run contrary to the government's aim of supporting legitimate merchants. Furthermore, if any of the suspended merchants believe they have legitimate reasons for not being suspended, they can reapply, and the Textile Construction Company will expedite a review. However, if the cloth merchants continue to oppose the principle of upholding legitimate merchants, the Textile Construction Company will allocate the distribution rights to cloth merchants in various ports across the country.

[Our Newspaper] The China Textile Construction Company announced last Saturday that it was suspending the cotton cloth allocation of 205 cotton cloth businesses, causing widespread indignation and calls for opposition. Yesterday, coinciding with the Textile Construction Company's cargo release date, all merchants unanimously ceased taking delivery. Existing marked goods were also stopped as a result. Around 9 AM, the Cotton Cloth Association, fearing escalation, convened an emergency meeting of directors and supervisors to discuss solutions. It was decided to explain the situation to the Textile Construction Company and to dispatch Standing Director Gao Aizhou, Director Jiang Zhaozu, Director Wang Shixiang, and representatives of the suspended merchants, including Wu Zhensan and Zhi Ziqing, among others, to the company to request a prompt restoration of allotments to avoid disputes. Deputy Manager Wu Weijing of the Textile Construction Company received them, expressing regret for any inaccuracies in the investigation, stating that facts could be appealed and quickly re-investigated for remedy. He also hoped that the association could provide more assistance. After the representatives returned to the association, they attended a meeting of fellow merchants. Many merchants remained dissatisfied, and the representatives planned to visit the leaders of fellow merchants to appeal again.

Further news: The Textile Construction Company issued the following notice yesterday afternoon at 4 PM: "Merchants whose yarn and cloth allocation has been suspended according to this company's announcement on the 28th, if they believe they have legitimate reasons for not being suspended, may provide full details and relevant documents and send them to this company. We will expedite a review. If they meet the requirements, they will be reinstated. This is hereby announced."

### Cotton Yarn and Cloth Decline

Yesterday's cotton yarn market saw sluggish initial trading due to tight credit, with both local and out-of-town buyers showing little interest. More sellers than buyers resulted in a soft market. Later, some out-of-town buyers saw the low prices as attractive and bought, causing prices to recover slightly. As a result, 42-count Blue Phoenix yarn was down 1.5 million yuan compared to Saturday, 20-count Double Horse yarn dropped 900,000 yuan, and 16-count Guangming yarn was down slightly at 1.1 million yuan. Other counts of coarse and fine yarn all fell by 3-400,000 yuan to over 1 million yuan.

Yesterday's cotton cloth market initially saw prices rise, but then declined as tight credit led to many sales and out-of-town buyers also became sellers. Ultimately, fine-headed cloth fell by 16,000 yuan compared to Saturday, and fine cloth such as Five Blessings Colored Balls and Blue Flannel also dropped by 2-3-400,000 yuan. Bleached cloth, coarse cloth, serge, and other items also uniformly declined.

Further news: The Textile Construction Company sold its usual Yang Flannel at 520,000 yuan, and Jumping Carp Yuan Guang twill at 500,000 yuan.

### Cotton Market Remains Weak

Yesterday's spot cotton market saw scarce buyers due to tight credit, causing prices to decline further. Sentiment was weak, and trading was light, with around 500 bales changing hands. Delivered to factory prices: Ling Shi traded at 3.35 million yuan, Da Zhong Ji 330 bales, 175 bales traded. Delivered to warehouse prices: Ling Bao 3.23 million to 3.3 million yuan, 315 bales traded. Zhou Pu seed cotton 510,000 yuan.

### Financial Firms Must Pay Reserve Funds; U.S. Treasury Bills Not Applicable

[Our Newspaper] The Ministry of Finance previously permitted financial firms to deposit short-term treasury bills in state banks to offset 50% of their deposit reserve requirement. However, since the value of treasury bills fluctuates according to market prices after conversion, they are not suitable for fixed reserve amounts. Therefore, starting yesterday, the measure of using treasury bills to offset reserve requirements has been canceled, and the previously deposited portion will be returned immediately.

### Coal Prices to be Adjusted Again

Regarding the further adjustment of coal prices per catty, a responsible person from the Fuel Management Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs stated on the 30th that, based on recent continuous increases in transportation labor costs and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, coal prices must be reasonably adjusted. The above matter has been submitted to the Ministry of Economic Affairs for approval and is expected to be formally announced on October 1st.

### Salt Exports to Japan Suspended

[Our Newspaper] In our country's barter trade with Japan, salt has been a major commodity. Since the Salt Administration submitted and received approval to cease using salt as barter goods in order to reduce salt taxes, the Central Trust Bureau's barter business has been greatly affected. Currently, the only remaining items for barter are sugar and mineral sands. However, it is understood that artificial silk raw materials needed by our country's industries can still be obtained from MacArthur's headquarters on a credit basis, so the supply will not be cut off.

### Many Seek Cash for Goods; Rayon Prices Decline; Factory Representatives' Asks Also Frequently Lowered

The rayon market plummeted yesterday morning due to unusually tight credit among fellow merchants, who were selling goods to obtain cash. As a result, 120-count miscellaneous brand bright rayon, which initially asked for 6.5-6.6 million yuan at the opening, eventually sold for 4.6-4.7 million yuan. By noon, it had fallen further to 3.2-3.3 million yuan at closing. In the afternoon, after credit stabilized, those holding goods were no longer willing to sell cheaply, and some trading occurred at 5 million yuan. The final price rose again to 6 million yuan for sale, resulting in a loss of 1.5 million yuan compared to the previous day.

Factory Representatives

The market was filled with cries yesterday, and asks were frequently lowered, but there was still a lack of trading. In the afternoon, prices stabilized slightly, with asks up 500,000 yuan from the morning. C-brand asked for 6 million yuan, and D-brand 5 million yuan, both down 500,000 yuan from the previous day. Traded prices ranged from 3 million to 4 million yuan. Thousand-count rayon was even more sluggish, with a sharper price decline.

Silk Goods

The market was steady yesterday. Although credit was tight among fellow merchants, the mood was better because various factories were either idling or on strike, reducing production daily. Da Cheng and Hua Qiang's silk quilt covers opened around 6.8 million yuan and rose steadily, with the highest trade at 7.3 million yuan. Later, due to falling raw material prices, they gradually retreated, closing at 7.02 million yuan for the immediate price, and 2.45 million yuan for deferred delivery. Checkered crepe asks remained at 61,000 yuan. Hua Jin crepe saw trading at 38,000 yuan for high-end goods yesterday due to the sharp decline in rayon. All goods showed some softness.

### Wang Xueliang Died at the Hands of the "Changshu Wolf"; Widow Cries for Information on the Time and Place

To the Editor: On July 9, 1943, the enemy, led by the captain stationed in Changshu, "Mimura Haruki," simultaneously massacred civilians in the towns and villages of Taicang, involving Shanghai, Wuxian, Kunshan, Changshu, Songjiang, Wujiang, and other places, totaling four to five hundred people. Among them, Wu Yufang and five others were shot first. Zheng Peiyun was released but then pursued and killed. My late husband, Wang Xueliang, and seventeen others have been missing ever since, their whereabouts unknown. Although the murderer has been brought to justice, and the accomplice Zheng Fengshi has been sentenced to life imprisonment by the Jiangsu High Court, the date and place of martyrdom for my late husband and the other seventeen victims remain unknown. Some say it was at Dachang, others say it was at Gaojing Temple in Jiangwan, but these are just rumors with no supporting evidence. My late husband was born with completely white hair and was nearsighted. He was probably killed after March 2, 1944. If there is any kind person nearby who can remember the year and month and indicate the location, so that his bones can be returned, not only will the deceased rest in peace, but future generations will be eternally grateful. Correspondence address: "Wang Xuejun, Shanghai Telecom Bureau, corner of Sichuan Road and Fuzhou Road, Shanghai" or "Wang Ouyang Yunfang, Shatou Town, Taicang." I implore your public consideration.

Widow Wang Ouyang Yunfang, with tears, September 20th

### In Memory of Artist Han Leran, Who Died in a Plane Crash in Jiuquan

— Jing Qi

In the summer of 1946, I accompanied Dean Yu on an inspection tour of Xinjiang and met Mr. Han Leran in Dihua. Dean Yu especially valued Leran, predicting that he would make a great contribution to our country's art. At the time, Leran had just returned to Dihua from the Baicheng area of southern Xinjiang, where he discovered many Tang Dynasty Buddhist paintings and historical sites. He was invited to go to southern Xinjiang again and readily agreed. For over half a month in southern Xinjiang, we traveled through more than ten counties and districts, often hearing him talk about his years of searching for Buddhist caves and excavating historical sites. He endured freezing cold and hunger, braving all kinds of dangers. Sometimes he got lost in the Gobi Desert, eating snow and drinking wind. Camel riders searched in all directions to find the way, eventually getting out of danger. It was like listening to an adventure story, and I was captivated. During the journey, he would often paint portraits of his companions, sometimes finishing them in a few strokes, capturing their essence perfectly. The group photo of his companions taken from the plane over the Tianshan Mountains was especially lifelike. After returning to Dihua, Leran exhibited over a hundred of his works from southern Xinjiang. The dozens of copies he made of the murals in the Buddhist caves were all painted by Tang Dynasty artists, clearly demonstrating the beginning of artistic exchange between China and the West. His initial oil and watercolor paintings depicted the people and customs of various ethnic groups, capturing them vividly, drawing sighs of admiration. This kind of exhibition was unprecedented in Dihua, and thousands of local people came to see it, making it a grand event. Dean Yu also appointed him as a specialist member of the Xinjiang District Supervisory Envoy's Office to encourage him. Last winter, he wrote from Lanzhou, saying that he planned to go to southern Xinjiang again this spring to continue his unfinished work and conduct systematic research. Last month, I received a letter from the Kizil Thousand Buddha Caves in Baicheng, dated June 22, detailing the general situation of his work and future aspirations. Unexpectedly, news reports stated that he went missing on the 31st while on a flight from Hami to Jiuquan. The news was reported to Dean Yu, who was deeply grieved. A telegram from Lanzhou yesterday stated that Leran was carrying his paintings from southern Xinjiang.

Leran was from the Northeast and studied painting in France. He returned to China after the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War and participated in political work, traveling to Hebei, Shanxi, Shaanxi, and other provinces for many years. He married after the victory. He then went to Dunhuang with Zhang Daqian to study Buddhist paintings and went to southern Xinjiang, Turpan, Kuqa, Baicheng, and other places to study and copy Tang Dynasty paintings in the Buddhist caves. He also excavated many Western Xia inscriptions. Because of his artistic talent, profound knowledge, research interests, strong will, and ability to endure hardship and danger, it was believed that he would contribute to the development of culture in the Northwest. Unexpectedly, his ambition was not fulfilled, and he suffered this disaster! This is not only a misfortune for the culture of the Northwest, but also a great loss for the art world of our country. I am now offering his letter for reference to those who are interested in ancient art, and I end with a few words in memory.

### Mr. Han Leran's Last Letter

(Omitted above) After returning to Lanzhou from Xinjiang last year, I began preparations, which began to take shape in January of this year. Due to transportation issues, I left Lanzhou for Xinjiang on February 22, with two assistants, five students, and all the necessary equipment, arriving in Dihua on March 12. I originally planned to work in Turpan for a long time, but the local situation was chaotic, so I had to change my plans and go west.

I left Dihua on April 2 and arrived safely at the Kizil Thousand Buddha Caves in Baicheng on the 19th, discovering many ancient city ruins along the way. Because I had pre-arranged work, I could not excavate them immediately. After staying in Kuqa for six days, I went to Kumtura on the 16th for inspection. This is my second time coming here. This place is fifty miles away from the car, and there are high mountains on both sides. The Buddhist caves are on the right side of the mountain cliff. Because the mountain is formed by alluvial sand and gravel, it is easily weathered. Therefore, the sacred site of that day is a complete mess. The Wei Gan River in front of the cave is weeping, like mourning the past and feeling sad. At this time, I also felt a little sentimental.

Very few murals can still be seen in these Buddhist caves, no more than twenty at most. Even fewer are relatively intact, and the rest are broken and dilapidated. Most of the mural losses are man-made. Some were destroyed by the common people and tourists, and some were stripped away by foreign archaeological teams. They also systematically destroyed all Chinese characters, trying to destroy our culture and emphasize their own civilization. But they did not do it thoroughly enough. Many of the names of the Buddhas and the ancient explanations can still be seen vaguely in Chinese characters. According to my investigation, they are indeed works from the Tang Dynasty in our country. Our culture will eventually return to us, how can they destroy it?

The Kizil Thousand Buddha Caves, where I am currently working, are also where I worked last year. In our country, apart from the Dunhuang Buddhist Caves, there is nothing that can compare to it. Not only are there many caves and temples, but the works are also older, dating back at least 1,300 to 2,000 years. According to the results of sorting and numbering, there are a total of seventy-five caves with paintings, which are much more complete than Kumtura. But the stripping away by foreign archaeological teams is even more severe. Some have been completely taken. On the remaining incomplete paintings, one can still see the artistic spirit of the time. Not only is the composition precise and the coloring gorgeous, but attention is also paid to human anatomy and light and shadow contrast. Moreover, their religious thoughts and philosophical foundations are also expressed. This proves that the painters at that time were not ordinary craftsmen, but experts with thoughts and training. In a cave without Buddha paintings, there were anatomical drawings, which further proves the existence of art school-like facilities.

On June 2nd, a Kaiyuan coin from the Tang Dynasty was found in front of the first cave, indicating that the Han people had close contacts here at that time.

Because the equipment I am using is about to run out, I plan to return to Lanzhou on June 19th. I will conduct a review of this work, and I have copied more than 30 large and small oil paintings, almost all representing different periods. My other assistants and students have copied more than 30 kinds of patterns and paintings, and there are photographic reporters and other work. In the last two weeks, with limited funds, I have been excavating. Because there are many caves that have never been excavated. I hired thirteen workers and spent ten days cleaning up one cave. The harvest from this trial excavation was great. The murals were novel and not found in other caves. Except for a small part damaged by the earthquake, the rest were intact. Moreover, there are many ancient characters on the paintings, like the titles of the paintings and the names of people. This is what I have been hoping for, and it is valuable. In addition, I have also obtained many ancient decorations, faded wooden panel paintings, and partial sculptures. In order to finish copying the murals in the new cave, I had to extend it by one week. I am afraid that the new cave will be destroyed again, so I hired a carpenter to make a door and lock it, and handed it over to a local to manage. The Baicheng County Government also issued a notice, and I think it will definitely be better in the future.

After going back, I will sort out this work and make preparations for the next phase of work. I may enter Xinjiang this winter and plan to go west from Kuqa to Kashgar and Ruoqiang. (Omitted below)

### Recent Poems by Xiang Yuelou

— Song Xunlun

Expressing My Feelings

Not staying at Wenlang's Jade Mirror Terrace, how is it related to emotions resembling wind and thunder? The fairy dream on the Luo River has become a relic, and the tender feelings of spring orchids have turned to ashes. The jade tree and bright pearls are empty and lingering, and the falling flowers and flowing water wander alone. The cold plum's temperament resembles Vimalakirti's, only suitable for hiding this talent in West Lake.

Second Poem After thirty years, a child's heart is impossible to find, poetry enters a state of decline from splendor. Regretting joining the Gaha girl in understanding emotions, I wish to play the zither to Zhong Ziqi. Who under my eyes can be my phoenix mate? The sword in the box serves as a dragon's roar. The sound of autumn arises in Jiangcheng overnight, suppressing the mournful strings to play ancient sounds. (Recently studying music and frost songs with Ling Rumei's sons)

### One Inch of Mountains and Rivers, One Inch of Blood

— Ye Jingfeng

Yaoqun determined the location of the mark and immediately crossed the street, pretending to be casually looking at the street scene. She stood with her back against the wall, quickly and skillfully surveying the surroundings. With a swift movement of her hand behind her back, she used a pencil to draw the mark in the corresponding position on the photograph.

After making the mark, Yaoqun casually lingered around the hotel, checking to see if the mark was complete and correct. Just as she was loitering back to the entrance of the inn, she suddenly noticed five or six young men of different ages, ranging from about twenty to thirty years old, approaching from twenty or thirty yards to the south. Although these young men were walking separately, not connected to each other, the uniformity of their pace and speed made them stand out as a small group among the many pedestrians. From the same point of view, she saw three or four young men across the street also walking with a consistent pace.

In Yaoqun's eyes, the identification of this group of young men was even clearer than the identification of a uniformed army unit mixed in with ordinary people. She guessed that one of the young men might be a comrade from the Tianjin Detachment. She turned and stepped up the two stone steps at the entrance of the inn, facing outwards. In this way, she made her own position and target very prominent. Not only would a comrade not miss this target, but even unrelated passersby would be attracted by her conspicuous position and give her a curious, appreciative, or bored glance in their busy lives.

Yaoqun estimated the distance of the approaching men and quickly sent out the signal - an extremely ordinary action that no outsider, no matter how nervous, would suspect, but it was a signal for comrades to inquire about each other. Her bright, sparkling eyes swept over the scattered line of young men like lightning. She hoped to receive a response.

Sure enough, one of the young men walking at the head of the line, about thirty years old, wearing an ordinary suit, of medium height, fair-skinned, with a long, thin face, and the most distinctive mark was a pair of long, drooping eyebrows, like the "eyebrows reaching the temples" mentioned in common books, like the stage makeup, expressing a strong rebellious personality. He saw Yaoqun at a glance and recognized her signal. His eyes lit up suddenly, expressing surprise. He immediately raised his right hand casually and stroked his hair, replying to Yaoqun's signal. At the same time, his eyebrows suddenly twitched.

"Strange! ...It's so hard to find a car." Yaoqun muttered to herself quietly while the leader was still five or six steps away. This was the second step in exploring a comrade: "Hidden Words." (There were no fixed words for this type of hidden language, just ordinary words that were seen and felt. If there were companions speaking to each other, repeating the sentence would serve as the sign.)

According to regulations, if the person who came was a comrade, after hearing this hidden language, he should immediately reply with a "guessing game"-style sentence. The reply only needed to be slightly related to the meaning of the other party's utterance. But this comrade seemed to see some warning signs and did not open his mouth. He only glanced at the "China Hotel" sign, replacing his answer (Yaoqun's "hiring a car" indicates movement from this place to a certain place, or indicates the intention to go to a destination. The person looked at the hotel sign, indicating "address" is targeted with "hiring a car", or replying to Yaoqun not to go to her destination, seeming to say that he already knows the "location" and can come to "China Hotel"). After answering, he also snapped his thumb and middle finger together, making a "crack" sound, sending out a "particularly dangerous" warning.

Known for her resourcefulness, since she had received a reply to the hidden language and also received a special danger signal at the same time, she should quickly pay attention to the environment, temporarily suspend other steps in searching for comrades, carefully examine her own actions, and pay attention to where the danger was, in order to avoid it. But at this time, Yaoqun, for some unknown reason, seemed to have lost her mind. Perhaps she was too careless and did not value the other party's warning. She only smiled slightly and stepped off the steps, preparing to follow the leader and inquire again.

Every truly talented writer is like a mirror, capable of reflecting both dark clouds and bright sunshine with the same brilliance, and blending them into a pure whole. Ordinary people, however, are swallowed up in the dirty and unclean waves, unable to reflect light or darkness. (Notes from St. Petersburg)

### The Pain of Mourning a Deceased Wife

— Lean Oriole

Miscellaneous Pieces from the Violet Box

The pain of mourning a deceased wife is something only those who have experienced it can truly understand. Feng Qian's grief is not surprising. In particular, mourning a wife in middle or old age is the hardest to bear, because one has grown accustomed to living with a long-time partner. The blow of being separated by death is simply too great. On the 23rd day of the fourth month of the Bingxu year, my wife, Feng Jun, passed away from lung disease complicated by heart disease. We had depended on each other for thirty years, and suddenly we were separated forever. Even the "broken intestines" described by ancient Chinese poets, or the "heartbreak" described by Westerners, cannot compare to the pain I felt at that time. Later, I wrote a "Letter to My Deceased Wife, Feng Jun," and also filled out more than thirty stanzas of short poems like "Luo Fu Mei" and "Zui Hua Yin," which finally allowed me to vent some of my grief. However, for the past year, the remaining sorrow has not faded, and various emotions arise. I thought about writing another ten-thousand-word letter to my deceased wife in the afterlife, to tell her about the various things that have happened this past year. I mentioned it to my friends, and they said: "Forget it, the dead are gone. Why do something so useless and cause yourself more grief?" I thought they were right, so I intended to put down my pen, and eventually I did. But usually, whenever I read the poems and lyrics of people in the past, I always paid attention to their works mourning the deceased, selecting those that were both emotionally and literarily moving, and copying them down one by one, as a way of using other people's wine glasses to pour out my own sorrows. Among them, like Li Fanxie's "Mourning My Deceased Concubine on the Lantern Festival," set to the tune of "Qing Ping Yue," it says: "Tears soak my spring clothes, who asks how shallow the spring cold is? Still the same as last year's Lantern Festival, the brocade zither's beautiful years are not yet full. Coming again to the winding path, the moss is desolate. A screen of plum shadows is desolate. Suspecting she's before and behind the small building, not knowing where she is hiding?" The last two sentences are fanciful and all the more poignant. Nalan Rongruo's "Xiao Shan Shi Mourning the Deceased" says: "Lately, there have been countless sad things, who can I talk to about the long nights? Just let them go, the green window, red tears, the early geese first cry... At that time, I understood, but now it's all lost, I've been unfaithful to my feelings. Suddenly I suspect you've arrived, the painted lantern flickers in the wind, foolishly counting the spring stars." "Nan Xiang Zi" inscribed on a photo of his deceased wife says: "Tears choke me, but no sound comes out. I only regret my indifference in the past. Depending on the portrait to try to recognize you again, delicate and beautiful. A piece of heartbrokenness cannot be painted. Separate words, the state is clear. At midnight, the mandarin ducks' dream wakes up early. You wake up early, I dream, again and again. Crying until the night rain bell on the wind eaves is exhausted." "Jin Lü Qu, Feeling on the Anniversary of My Deceased Wife's Death" says: "When will this hate end! Dripping in the empty courtyard, the cold rain has stopped, the weather for burying flowers. Three years have passed, my soul and dreams are distant, if it's a dream, it should have woken up long ago. I expect you also feel that the human world is tasteless. It can't compare to being separated by the dust of the night terrace, cold and desolate, a piece of land burying sorrow, hairpin agreement, completely abandoned. If there are paired fish to send in the underworld, let them know whether the years to come will be bitter or joyful, who will you rely on? I toss and turn all night, enduring to hear the Xiang zither re-tuned. Waiting to make an acquaintance in another life. I'm still afraid that both of us will have short lives. There will be little chance of meeting again in the wind and moon. Clear tears are exhausted, paper ashes rise." There are several other pieces, all found in the Tongzhitang Lyrics, which also show how painful he was at the time. Hong Beijiang also sighed deeply in his poems and lyrics because of the death of his wife, Jiang Shi, which were very sincere. Poems like "Seven-Character律 Poems Mourning the Deceased Wife," eight in total, contain lines like "Occasionally thinking of your words, I weep in my leisure, frequently summoning your living soul in secret, how can I bear the cold pillow and cold quilt at night, hearing again the cries of my children?" "Who pities the lonely shadow of the one who dies later, your last words have already arranged for another life," and other lines that are very sad and moving. Lyrics like "Lang Tao Sha" says: "Dreaming of entering the small red door. Dew wets the curtain. The shadow of the waning moon on the money box is faint. It's just that outside the tent of the lonely sleeper, butterflies fly in pairs. With even more suspicion. Afraid to step on the stairs. Vaguely recognizing you in the painted screen's Luanchu. On the seven-foot sandalwood table, who is performing spirit writing?" "The setting sun shines on the ghost gate pass. The crescent moon is curved. Can one see the Husband-Watching Mountain from the night terrace? Afraid that the thin soul cannot be supported, adding a red post. Pushing the pillow, the drip pot is about to run out. Vermilion tears are spotted. How can the cold night only be returned in dreams? If there is no place to bury hate underground, I will still come to the human world." Also says: "The road is far, the small building is low. Flowers scatter and fly. Still holding hatred, climbing the heavy stairs. Not only can't I find the old person, even the swallows on the beam are not the same. Opening the meeting door in sorrow. The waning moon is just setting in the west. The wind breaks the painted curtain, the dressing table is askew. Only the six-panel folding screen still covers the silk clothes." "Eight-Sound Ganzhou, Dreaming of the Deceased Wife" says: "Towards the end of the empty room, the tile lamp is dim, the crescent moon's shadow is horizontal. Calculating the pain of separation and the passing away, the end of winter is already like this, how much more after spring? Folding the half-bed of quilts and pillows, often brushing away the fine dust. The mirror is all well, to shine on the returning soul. After all, what am I hiding from you? Only when we meet on the night terrace, the intervals are still attentive. Sighing at King Xiang's lonely lodge, the flowing clouds have long been cut off. Thinking of the twelve railings east and west, even in dreams, I want to patrol around. Plum blossom verses, from now on, I will not write them, lest they contain a frown." The line "Can one see the Husband-Watching Mountain from the night terrace" in his "Lang Tao Sha" is roughly similar to the line "The nine springs should have a Husband-Watching Mountain" in my poem mourning my deceased wife, which shows that the foolish thoughts of those who mourn the deceased can coincide without prior consultation.
