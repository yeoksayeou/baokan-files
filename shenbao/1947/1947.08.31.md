### Various Foreign Currency Public Bonds and Savings Certificates to be Redeemed at Foreign Exchange Market Prices; U.S. Dollar Short-Term Treasury Bills to Continue to be Sold at Market Prices; Seventh Provisional Meeting of the Executive Yuan Approves

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 30th] The Executive Yuan held its seventh provisional meeting at 9:00 AM on the 30th, with over twenty members attending, chaired by Zhang Qun. Two major items were approved: (1) The 1948 Administrative Policy Outline was resolved to be submitted for review. (2) The Ministry of Finance proposed that, following the government's announcement of revised foreign exchange control measures, separate review procedures should be established for all U.S. dollar short-term treasury bills issued by the government in 1947, as well as previously issued various foreign currency public bonds, to maintain creditor confidence. The resolutions were: 1. U.S. dollar short-term treasury bills for 1947 will continue to be sold at the listed market price of designated banks, effective immediately. 2. The principal and interest of U.S. dollar short-term treasury bills for 1947 will be calculated according to the listed market price of designated banks at maturity. 3. The 1938 British pound and U.S. dollar public bonds, the 1940 British pound and U.S. dollar construction bonds, the 1942 Allied Victory U.S. dollar public bonds, and the 1942 U.S. dollar savings certificates will all be converted to national currency based on the listed market price of designated banks.

The 1948 Administrative Policy Outline is Referred to a Special Task Force for Review

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 30th] The government's 1948 Administrative Policy Outline was submitted for discussion at the Executive Yuan meeting on the 30th. Due to the broad scope of the content and time constraints, a thorough discussion was not possible. It was decided that Wang Yunwu would convene a separate task force meeting for special review. It is reported that the outline contains a total of thirty-six articles, divided into two main sections: one for implementing constitutional government and the other for strengthening the suppression of rebellion, drafted by the Central Design Bureau.

[Another Dispatch] Following the Executive Yuan's decision on the morning of the 30th to continue issuing U.S. dollar treasury bills, Finance Minister Yu told reporters: Before the Central Bank's exchange rate (i.e., the official rate) is changed, the government could have paid in national currency converted at the bank's U.S. dollar rate on the payment date. However, to implement the spirit of issuing these treasury bills and demonstrate credibility, the Executive Yuan, after detailed discussion this morning, decided on the following three measures: (1) U.S. dollar treasury bills will be sold at the listed market price of designated banks. (2) The principal and interest of these treasury bills at maturity will be redeemed at the listed market price of designated banks. (3) The British pound and U.S. dollar public bonds of 1938, the British pound and U.S. dollar construction bonds of 1940, the Allied Victory U.S. dollar public bonds of 1942, and the U.S. dollar savings certificates will all be redeemed for principal and interest at the listed market price of designated banks. While this decision will inevitably increase the burden on the national treasury, the government is willing to implement it for the sake of creditor confidence. It hopes that the people of the nation will understand this intention and enthusiastically subscribe to complete the mission of the people during the suppression of the rebellion and national recovery.

### New Construction Program of the Kuomintang; Divided into Three Major Sections, Resolved to be Submitted for Discussion at the Fourth Plenary Session

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 30th] As the Fourth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang is about to open, the Standing Committee, after studying and formulating the "Party's New Construction Program," has decided to submit it for discussion at the plenary session. It is learned that the content of the program is divided into three major sections: one is a review of the current situation, the second is the current organizational program, and the third is the post-recovery revolutionary political program. The main points of its content are recorded as follows:

(1) The review of the Party's current situation states that it has been twenty-three years since the reorganization in 1924 and nineteen years since the general registration in 1928, making it necessary to add new vitality. The shortcomings of past party affairs are reviewed in five points: 1. Insufficient revolutionary enthusiasm, allowing bureaucrats and politicians to infiltrate; 2. The Party only focuses on form, and the policy of cultivating cadres is insufficient; 3. Party discipline is lax; 4. The style leans towards pragmatism and is disconnected from actual politics; 5. The awareness of small organizations within the Party is strong. To complete the revolution in the future, the Party must be revitalized.

(2) The current organizational program of the Party includes four items regarding party members: 1. Standards for party members; 2. Delineation of the rights and obligations of party members; 3. Registration of party members' assets - A. Special attention should be paid to cadres and party members in government (party members serving in public enterprises and financial institutions). Those who make false reports should be punished; 4. Party members should take a new oath. B. Regarding organization and operation, it includes eleven points, the main ones being: A. The Seventh National Congress will be held on May 5, 1948; B. Strengthen management of party members in government; C. The President will regularly chair the Standing Committee; D. Investigate comrades with abilities among domestic cadres to go to the front lines; E. Establish the Party's cadre policy, etc. C. Regarding discipline: 1. Expel members of other parties and expel them from the Party; 2. Strengthen the powers of supervision; 3. Those expelled from the Party will not be employed within the Party apparatus as a sanction.

The post-recovery revolutionary political program is divided into six items: 1. Suppress the communist bandits, clearly stipulating the suppression of communist bandits while also suppressing local bandits and scattered bandits everywhere, and improve the treatment of officers and soldiers and make military expenditures public; 2. Consolidate national sovereignty, raise the status of the nation and the people, and negotiate with the Soviet Union to recover sovereign rights in the Northeast; 3. Eliminate corruption, pay attention to increasing the power of supervisory officials and the rights of provincial and county assemblies to question local leaders and approve budgets, and effectively improve the treatment of public employees and teachers; 4. Implement constitutional government, establish provincial and county budget and financial systems, and immediately implement direct elections of provincial and county magistrates; 5. Equalize land rights, change the current farming system with cooperative farms, complete land registration, and implement the collection of land value tax and land appreciation tax; 6. Regulate capital, implement planned economy, strictly restrict speculation and the development of bureaucratic capital, implement a unified property tax and income tax system, and improve the lives of the working masses based on social policies.

### Provisional Political Meeting Discusses Wei Ambassador's Statement in General Terms

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 30th] In his statement upon leaving China, Ambassador Wei criticized our government for corruption and incompetence. To review local politics and Ambassador Wei's statement, the Executive Yuan convened a provisional political meeting on the 30th. However, due to the large number of accumulated cases in the Executive Yuan requiring discussion, the discussion was only general and did not reach a conclusion. Zhang Qun delivered a speech before the discussion, and Zhang Lisheng and others also discussed the actual situation of local politics.

### Wei Ambassador Busy in Korea; Continues to Receive Representatives from Various Parties

[New Asia News Agency, Seoul, 30th] Since arriving here, U.S. Special Envoy Wedemeyer has been busy receiving people from all walks of life. This morning (30th) at 9:00 AM, he received Chief Civil Administrator Ahn Jae-hong, who presented him with a report from the interim government, including issues such as politics, economy, culture, education, civil engineering, agriculture, and labor. This afternoon, Special Envoy Wei continued to meet with representatives of individuals and groups. As of the time of dispatch, those he had met included representatives from the Korean Independence Party, the Independence Promotion Association, the Women's Nationalist Party, the Laboring People's Party, and Syngman Rhee, among others. The Korean Interim Legislative Assembly is currently in recess and will reconvene on September 1. At that time, Special Envoy Wei plans to visit the assembly in person to meet with the members.

[United Press, Washington, 29th] Kim Yo-in (transliteration), chairman of the Korean Affairs Research Association here, stated on the 29th that he hopes Representative Wedemeyer can listen to the voices of the silent masses of Korea and that the middle class and liberals of Korea can express their hopes and opinions without reservation. He stated that the opinions of the advisors to the military government in Korea do not represent the people because most of them were recommended by reactionary elements who were trusted by the U.S. authorities in Korea at the time. He also specifically pointed out that some important officials in the police department are former high-ranking Korean traitors from the Japanese regime era.

### Chen Cheng Leaves Nanjing for Shenyang Today; Before Leaving, He Expresses His Opinions on Governing the Northeast and Encourages His Subordinates to Complete the Goal of Building the Army

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 30th] Chen Cheng, also Director of the Northeast Headquarters, is scheduled to leave Nanjing for Shenyang on the morning of the 31st. At 4:00 PM on the afternoon of the 30th, people from the Northeast in Nanjing held a farewell tea party, attended by Liu Zhe, Ma Liang, Zhang Qianhua, and over a hundred others. Chen Cheng delivered a speech on the spot. He first praised the abundant resources of the Northeast, believing that without the Northeast, it is equivalent to having no North China, and without North China, it is equivalent to having no China. He then elaborated on his opinions on governance in the Northeast, roughly as follows: (1) In terms of politics, strive to consider the interests of the people and not separate from the people. A government that separates from the people is no longer a government, so in the future, we should strive to cooperate with the people. (2) Simplify the organization. He believes that the administrative organization in the Northeast is overly complex and has too many layers. In addition to the nine provinces and three cities in Jinan, there are also special commissioners from various ministries of the Executive Yuan, making the organization very large, which needs to be simplified. (3) Increase work efficiency, especially for the provincial governments of the provinces that have not yet been recovered, which are currently located in Shenyang, which is not conducive to the progress of work. Therefore, he advocates that the provincial governments should be located within their respective provinces. (4) In terms of economy, it is planned to transport soybeans and coal, special products of the Northeast, to exchange for machinery, cotton cloth, and flour from Guan Nei (inside the customs), so as to stabilize the economy of the Northeast. Chen Cheng concluded by saying that the goal is to eliminate the communist bandits, recover the lost territories, clean up officialdom, simplify the organization, punish corruption, and maintain military discipline. Subsequently, Yu Bin delivered a reply on behalf of the attendees, expressing his welcome and emphasizing that the people of the Northeast will definitely cooperate with Chen Cheng's command to achieve military-civilian cooperation and fulfill Chen Cheng's mission. The gathering dispersed at 5:00 PM.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 30th] According to the Military News Agency, Chen Cheng stated at the farewell gathering of people from the Northeast on the 30th: We are willing to make great sacrifices. No matter how difficult it is, the Northeast must be recovered from the hands of the rebels and fulfill the aspirations during the war of resistance. Our responsibility will not be completed until this goal is achieved. It is hoped that all people from the Northeast will work together to move towards this goal. Everything that the Northeast faces today is more serious than the situation under the past Japanese occupation. In the future, the Northeast will still focus on military affairs, but we will also do our best in terms of politics, economy, winning people's hearts, and seeking the happiness of the people. Currently, there are too many parallel organizations in the Northeast. Three plans have been drawn up: (1) The Political and Economic Committees will be abolished and reorganized to form a Political Affairs Bureau. (2) Both the Political and Economic Committees will be abolished without establishing other organizations. (3) The two committees will still be under the jurisdiction of the Northeast Headquarters. The provincial and municipal governments and party and youth organizations of the unreclaimed areas of the Northeast are now operating in Shenyang. There are also two suggestions for this situation: First, all local agencies should follow the army to operate in areas close to the provinces. Second, if they remain in Shenyang, they should all be merged and actively operate. The above suggestions will be submitted to the highest authorities for approval. Regarding the economy, Chen Cheng said: During this trip to the Northeast, it was found that the most urgent needs of the Northeast are food, cloth, and machinery, especially machinery. It is hoped that the central government can find ways to restore and rebuild the Northeast's industry, which will definitely increase production and destroy the communist bandits. Other aspects, such as improving people's lives and military-civilian cooperation, will also be fully committed to.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 30th] According to the Military News Agency, the National Government has ordered Chief of Staff Chen Cheng to also serve as Director of the Northeast Headquarters. Chairman Chiang summoned Chief Chen that evening, giving instructions on important military matters in the Northeast. As Chief Chen was about to depart, he summoned all officers above the rank of major from the various departments and bureaus of the Ministry of National Defense and the joint logistics headquarters of the army, navy, and air force at the auditorium of the ministry at 9:00 AM on the 30th, with over 1,430 officers attending. Chief Chen, dressed in military uniform, delivered a speech at the meeting, first reviewing the general business results of the Ministry of National Defense since its establishment fifteen months ago. He then earnestly encouraged his subordinates to continue their efforts to complete the military personnel system in order to build a modern national army. He later said: In the future, we should continue to emphasize frugality and rectify military discipline in order to achieve the goal of building the army and building the nation, so as to consolidate national defense and establish a strong new China. The meeting adjourned at about 9:00 AM.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 30th] When Chen Cheng summoned officers of the Ministry of National Defense for instructions on the morning of the 30th, he said: The main tasks of the Ministry of National Defense in the past fifteen months were two: one was to merge organizations. The original organization of the Ministry of National Defense had more than 10,000 units, which have gradually been reduced to more than 5,000 units. The second was to reorganize the army. This work has already progressed to a considerable extent and will continue in the future. Chen Cheng hopes to complete the national defense system within three years, and this matter should be pursued from three aspects: (1) Establish a personnel system. The retirement and dismissal of officers should be handled seriously. Chen pointed out the importance of metabolism. The Xiang Army and Huai Army and Yuan Shikai's Xiaozhan training troops were once extremely prosperous, but soon declined. Since the establishment of the National Revolutionary Army, it has been twenty years, and some have criticized it for also declining. If we can attach importance to the retirement and dismissal of officers, it will create a metabolic effect. (2) Establish a supply system. It is inappropriate for officers to concurrently manage supply. A supply system should be established. (3) Establish an education system. In the future, we should focus on the country. During his speech today, Chen Cheng expressed that corruption of military discipline should be thoroughly rectified, and he hoped to practice frugality in all aspects. Military officers have little income, so banquets should be kept frugal. Even military equipment should be carefully guarded. Finally, Chen Cheng also mentioned Wedemeyer's farewell remarks, hoping that everyone can reflect on themselves.

[Our Newspaper, Changchun, 30th] The Jilin Provincial Provisional Assembly sent a congratulatory telegram to Chen Cheng for his concurrent appointment as Director of the Northeast Headquarters, and looked forward to "seeing a new administration clean up officialdom, eliminate bandits, and recover the entire Northeast."

[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 30th] The Northeast Headquarters has completed its administrative affairs and is preparing to hand over. Secretary-General Hu Jiafeng, Secretary-General of the Political Committee Wen Jincheng, and Director of the Director's Office Xu Pengfei have all resigned.

### The Number of Seats for Occupational Group Elections; To be Decided After the Reopening of the Legislative Yuan; Restrictions on Women's Groups to be Revised

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 30th] Minister Gu Zhengchao met with reporters on the 30th to discuss the issue of occupational group elections, saying that the issue of the number of representatives of occupational groups needs to be resolved after the Legislative Yuan reopens. However, among various occupational representatives, the chambers of commerce are the most common and the most sound, but the number of representatives of commercial groups in the National Assembly is only thirteen, and in the Legislative Yuan only five, which seems to be too few. The Ministry of Social Affairs will consult with the Legislative Yuan on this matter based on the instructions of the National Government and the requests of various parties, and it is believed that an appropriate solution can be reached soon. Also, regarding the National Assembly's women's groups, the requirement that national women's groups "must have more than five branches in various provinces and cities, and their membership lists must be registered with the Ministry" is not in accordance with the People's Group Organization Law, since women's groups are ordinary groups and do not necessarily need to have grassroots organizations like occupational groups. The regulations stipulated by the Legislative Yuan are inconsistent with the People's Group Organization Law promulgated by the National Government. The Ministry will consult with the Legislative Yuan on this matter and hopes to obtain an appropriate solution. Regarding the Journalists Law, the Ministry will consult with the internal committee, and in the future, broadcast journalists may be included in the qualifications for journalists.

### Typhoon Landed in Fuzhou; Predicted to Reach Nanjing This Morning

[United Press, Tokyo, 30th] The U.S. Army's 43rd Weather Squadron reported that at 3:00 AM Tokyo time on the 30th, Typhoon "Inez" had reached the Fuzhou area of China. The wind direction has shifted slightly to the northwest, with a speed of sixteen miles per hour, and it may reach a point one hundred miles south of Nanjing at 3:00 AM on Sunday morning.

[Our Newspaper, Fuzhou, 30th] A Pacific typhoon invaded the Fujian coast from the Taiwan Strait and landed in the Fuzhou and Xiamen areas on the evening of the 28th, with strong winds reaching level eleven. Yesterday, Fuzhou city was shrouded in roaring winds and heavy rain, uprooting trees and collapsing houses, and stores were closed, creating a desolate scene in the city. The sea was turbulent, and all ships on various routes were temporarily suspended. Yesterday, telecommunications were interrupted, and reporters were blocked from sending dispatches. Today, the wind gradually weakened, and the timely rain gladdened the farmers, with hopes for the autumn harvest.

[Our Newspaper, Hangzhou, 30th] The typhoon passed through Hangzhou and Jiaxing yesterday and today. The Qiantang River surged at noon, and the seawall at Sibao in Hangzhou was also in danger. The original three or four miles of sandbanks in that area have collapsed completely. The tide has reached the highway, and because there is no stone embankment protection in that area, the situation is quite critical. The embankment engineering bureau is currently taking strict precautions.

### Ma Zhanshan Talks; Communist Bandits in the Northeast Brew Sixth Offensive

[Our Newspaper, Peiping, 30th] Ma Zhanshan flew from Shenyang to Peiping on the 27th to seek medical treatment and plans to return to Shenyang after a short rest. Ma Zhanshan met with reporters on the 30th, saying that communist bandits in the Northeast are indeed brewing a sixth offensive in many places. However, the Northeast has added the armies of Wang Tiehan and Zhou Ce, and the vacancies in the original armies have also been filled, greatly increasing their strength. With Chief Chen taking personal command in the future, the situation in the Northeast is expected to stabilize day by day. Regarding the Songbei Pacification, Ma Zhanshan said: The Songbei Pacification Headquarters was established two months ago by order of the Ministry of National Defense, but it has not yet started work. The organizational structure has six departments, plus eight departments including the press department. The heads of the departments are generally determined. The chief of staff, Fan Yushu, is the former deputy chief of staff of the Security Commander's Office. In the future, the headquarters will be located in Changchun. The affiliated troops are still awaiting allocation from above. Ma Zhanshan finally said that the underground army in Songbei is mostly fighting in the southern Manchuria area due to the shortage of weapons and ammunition, and its strength needs to be strengthened urgently.

[Our Newspaper, Changchun, 30th] There is fighting in the northern part of Wula Street, with the central part of the bandits, Zhou Bao, harassing Xiaosanjia from Daguchaizi. Fierce fighting is currently underway. In addition, the bandits in Pinggang, west of Xi'an, have been making probing attacks westward in small groups for several days.

### Third Batch of Distributed Ships Received in Qingdao Yesterday Morning

[Central News Agency, Qingdao, 30th] Eight ships in the third batch of Japanese distributed ships were received at a ceremony held in Qingdao City at 8:00 AM on the 30th.

### U.S. State Department Announces Diplomatic Personnel Stationed in China

[Central News Agency, Washington, 29th] The U.S. State Department announced the names of newly appointed diplomatic personnel. Klein and Lancaster will be assigned to Nanjing to serve in China, and Scott will be sent to work on consular affairs in North America.

### The United States Should Support China for Its Own Interests; Howard Newspaper Group Calls for Aid to China

[United Press, Washington, 30th] An editorial in the Howard newspaper group stated that the United States must do something for China, otherwise it can only withdraw from Asia. The Chinese Nationalist government has many shortcomings, but at a time when the world is divided into two opposing camps, the US and the Soviet Union, from the American point of view, there is one important point that is correct: Chairman Chiang is within the American camp. Air Force strategists believe that it is foolish not to support a friendly Chinese government. If the power of the CCP spreads to the Yellow River, the already reduced area cannot defend itself, and the United States will also suffer. Conversely, if a friendly China continues to hold the line, the United States can still use air bases to allow B-29s to reach points in Siberia at any time, and the Soviet Union will not dare to risk war.

### The Aspirations of Guangdong - Random Notes from a Southern Trip, Part Four…

— Bu Shaofu

There is a far-sighted observation circulating here:

If World War III breaks out, if the United States and the Soviet Union are the main belligerents, the battleground will be in Korea, our Northeast, or even Northwest. At that time, our rear area for resistance will not be Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou in the Southwest, but rather Guangdong and Guangxi in South China, and Guangzhou may become the wartime capital.

This conclusion has a strong seductive and stimulating power.

Bearing the responsibility of China's rear area in World War III is a difficult task, but this vision encourages the Guangdong authorities to work hard on construction. I dare not say that the "Guangdong Province Five-Year Construction Plan" was caused by this factor, but I know that our war of resistance has already been won, and construction still needs to be completed. This is our national policy, but this message has a considerable influence.

During my stay in Guangzhou, I encountered power outages and lights as dim as beans more than once. The places where this happened included grand restaurants in the busiest urban areas and the residences of certain bureau chiefs. I once asked several local people about this, and their answers were no different from Mr. Luo Zhuoying's – a shortage of coal. According to Mr. Yao, Guangdong now relies on coal from Hunan; and the Yuehan Railway (Guangdong-Hankou Railway) occupies a large portion of the consumption. There are not enough train cars, and when transportation problems occur, the source of coal becomes even more difficult. This issue aroused my interest. Economic construction cannot be separated from power, and among power sources, coal is the most important raw material. How much coal reserves does Guangdong have?

The "Guangdong Province Five-Year Construction Plan" (which the provincial government completed after meticulous research by over a hundred experts and scholars over eight months) has the following explanation in the coal mine section of the mining category:

'...The province produces very little coal, almost incomparable to other countries in the world (annual output of 200,000 tons)... According to the mining summary of the 23rd year of the Republic of China (1934), the province's coal reserves rank 22nd in the country, with a total of 421,000,000 tons. Among them, bituminous coal accounts for about 90 percent, and anthracite coal accounts for about 10 percent. Anthracite coal was previously only used for burning lime and for household cooking, but with a little mixing, it can be used for industrial purposes. Although bituminous coal accounts for the majority of the reserves, most of it is still semi-anthracite coal, and the amount of bituminous coal that can be used for coking and metallurgy is still small.'

How much of the 400 million tons of reserves can be used for "industrial purposes"? Experts and scholars have not yet given a definite answer. This makes people quite apprehensive about the independence of Guangdong's industrial construction in the future. Whether it is dependent or independent, Guangdong's underground resources are still buried, and the living standards of people above ground are not high enough. There are too many things that need to be done. In a nutshell, Guangdong needs development and construction. According to the provincial government's first five-year plan (there are a total of four five-year plans), if it is completed as scheduled in the 40th year of the Republic of China (1951), even if it encounters a disaster like this year's, it will not be so urgent as to appeal to other provinces for relief.

The construction plan, so far, has not been carried out in a decisive and concrete way. The atmosphere is naturally very strong, especially the activities of foreign capital and overseas Chinese capital. In Hong Kong and Haikou, I have heard similar intentions. Foreign capital and overseas Chinese capital have taken a fancy to Guangdong, which is undoubtedly very insightful. However, they still have a concern, and that is the issue of security. This is for the sake of capital safety. In addition, they need the government to provide a kind of guarantee for operations, which is for the sake of the safety of profits. Before these two prerequisites are met, foreign capital and overseas Chinese capital may always hesitate and be reluctant to move forward.

In the Dongguan Guest House where I was staying, there once lived a distinguished guest of the provincial government – Major Hanley of the United States. He represented some American investors to negotiate with the Guangdong Provincial Government on cooperative construction projects. This negotiation started as early as last summer, and now, a preliminary draft has already been signed – the provincial government has requested instructions from various central ministries and commissions and received their consent. The remaining issue is the formal establishment of Hanley Company in the United States, fundraising, and the transportation of machinery to China.

Xie Wenlong, the Director of the Construction Department, was one of the main representatives participating in this negotiation. Until I left Guangzhou, I did not find an opportunity to talk to him about the specifics of Hanley Company. However, I know that Luo Zhuoying spent a lot of effort to present this matter to the central government and get it approved. The same is true for Guangdong Province itself. Because whether it is the central government or the local government, there is always a contradictory mentality towards foreign capital – on the one hand, it is welcomed, and on the other hand, it is feared. Under this contradictory mentality, some plans and opportunities are strangled or shelved. I do not know the details of the preliminary draft agreement signed between Hanley Company and the Guangdong Provincial Government, but I know that two principles have been agreed upon by both parties: first, within a certain number of years (about ten years), Guangdong Province can gradually recover the American shares of various factories, and the total amount of American shares must not exceed 50% of the total capital; second, all land, factory buildings, and construction of various factories are to be undertaken by Guangdong Province, and all staff members, except for a few engineers and technicians, are also to be appointed by Guangdong Province. Major Hanley took the draft agreement back to the United States, leaving only a few assistants in Hong Kong and Guangzhou.

Hanley himself is not a capitalist, but he has connections with the Export-Import Bank of the United States and has considerable appeal in the United States. Now that he has obtained the protection of the Guangdong Provincial Government for cooperation, there will certainly be no difficulties in proceeding. In fact, besides Hanley, many British and American people are willing to invest in Guangdong. According to Mr. Liu Zuoren, the president of the Guangdong Provincial Bank, there are four similar contacts with him privately, one of whom is British. These people are either very wealthy themselves or have made a lot of war profits in this war. In order to avoid the heavy property taxes of their own governments, they are very eager to transfer their assets to China. If they can make a profit from this, wouldn't it be even better? Therefore, they are very eager, but their governments have repeatedly stopped them, saying: Take your time and see what the situation in China is before making a decision!

The return of overseas Chinese to invest is not only a subjective inevitability. When a Chinese person has money, he naturally has to return to his motherland and use it on the land of his motherland; but also an objective inevitable trend. In this war and after the war, the overseas Chinese deeply felt the lack of security for their property overseas. Especially after the war, the surging national self-determination movements everywhere, the situation of the overseas Chinese is like a sandwich, suffering from two sides of pressure, which is extremely painful. If the motherland gives guarantees and conveniences for investment, they will definitely take back all their possessions at all costs. However, for several years, we have been shouting to welcome overseas Chinese to return to invest. Can we cite a few successful undertakings that are the product of this movement? During my trip this time, in Hainan Island, I also heard an unpleasant incident about overseas Chinese investment. An overseas Chinese development company (?) purchased several acres of land in Wenchang before the war, preparing to engage in farm management. These lands have formal title deeds and certificates from the Guangdong Provincial Department of Finance and the Ministry of Finance. Later, due to the war, followed by the fall of the area, it had to be temporarily suspended. After the victory, when they returned to Hainan Island, several people from Wenchang came out to stop them, saying that there was a problem with their property rights. The county government's mediation was unsuccessful, the local court ruled against him, and the high court irresponsibly sent it back for retrial, wasting time and effort. Several persons in charge of this company were almost driven mad.

Guangdong has a vision. In addition to planning, everyone knows that the use of foreign capital and overseas Chinese capital are two major forces that cannot be ignored. Foreign capital and overseas Chinese capital are also willing to come. The problem is whether we can give guarantees and conveniences.

### TASS Distorts Treaty on Dalian Port Opening

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 30th] After our official statement that "Dalian Port cannot be opened until our government has officially taken over Dalian," according to a report from the United Press on the 28th, TASS issued a statement saying: "According to Article 4 of the Sino-Soviet Treaty, before the establishment of a peace treaty with Japan, Dalian should be under the jurisdiction of the administrative organ of the Lushun Naval Base area, and Soviet ships still have the right to enter Dalian," etc. The Central News Agency notes: Article 4 of the Sino-Soviet "Agreement on Dalian" stipulates that "Dalian shall only be under the control of the Lushun Military Region during the war against Japan," and there is no provision for "before the establishment of a peace treaty with Japan." The Chinese government believes that what TASS said is purely a distortion of the treaty.

### Zhang Junmai Will Return to Shanghai Immediately; No Decision Yet on Candidates to Fill Vacancies for Political Committee Members of the Democratic Socialist Party in the Government

[Our newspaper] According to Yang Yuzi, a standing committee member of the Democratic Socialist Party, told reporters: "Zhang Junmai will take a flight back to Shanghai within a day or two and does not intend to go to Nanjing first. The candidates to fill the vacancies for the Democratic Socialist Party's government committee's political committee members have not been considered yet and will be decided after Mr. Zhang returns to Shanghai. All the outside rumors are completely inaccurate."

### Henan and Shandong Recover Huangchuan and Zhucheng; Remnants of Liu Bocheng's Troops Flee into Dabie Mountains

[Our Newspaper, Xuzhou, 30th] The National Army's pursuing and suppressing troops in southern Henan crossed the Huai River from Huajiadian, Linhedian, Dalindian, and Dougou on the 29th, respectively, advancing towards Huangchuan and Luoshan. Huangchuan was recovered on the afternoon of the 30th (Huangchuan was captured by bandits on the night of the 28th). The remnants of the Liu bandits' 2nd and 6th Columns fled south in a panic. In addition, more than 1,000 Liu bandits fled south through Guangshan on the 28th and arrived at Jingfu. This is the vanguard of the Liu bandits' remnants entering the Dabie Mountains.

Editorial

### Let Us Rely on Our Own Efforts!

The day before yesterday, the State Council meeting, personally presided over by Chairman Chiang, made important new decisions regarding the current domestic and foreign policy. Yesterday's Political Affairs Conference continued to conduct a more detailed review. According to reports from various sources, the government's administration in the future will focus on the following aspects: (1) Emphasizing self-reliance; foreign loans will only be accepted if they have no political conditions. (2) Striving to reform politics, diligently governing, and especially expediting the rectification of governance in non-pacification areas, particularly striving to eliminate corruption. (3) Intensifying the suppression of bandits in the pacification areas. (4) Holding universal elections as scheduled to democratize politics. If these principles can be effectively implemented, China's politics will naturally take on a new look and embark on a path of revitalization. However, these principles today value action over empty talk. How to put them into practice? It requires not only the efforts of the government but also the awareness and determination of the people.

Chairman Chiang frankly stated that when Special Envoy Wedemeyer was ordered to come to China in late July to investigate, the Chinese people held great hope for American aid. Everyone believed that the United States would be able to assist our economic construction and help us overcome the current difficulties. However, after Wedemeyer spent a month in China, his farewell remarks seemed to turn everyone's hopes into bubbles. Thus, the psychology of hoping for American aid has transformed into demanding that the government rely on its own efforts. In fact, this shift in psychology is simply human nature. Furthermore, we believe that only when we can first rely on our own efforts will foreign aid come unbidden. China's post-war reconstruction naturally needs foreign aid, and just like after World War I, the development of Chinese industry truly welcomes cooperation with international capital and technology. Therefore, China's return to seeking self-reliance first today is not based on emotions, nor does it contain any trace of xenophobia. Especially since the friendship between China and the United States is not superficial, if we can truly rely on our own efforts, then our American allies will surely "add flowers to the brocade."

We have repeatedly read and deeply felt Wedemeyer's farewell remarks. Although we do not yet know the government's attitude, we feel that Wedemeyer's visit to China seemed to be a futile trip, a superfluous act. According to a United Press International dispatch from Washington by Hans Lay, Wedemeyer made this statement seemingly implying a deep purpose. He demanded two points: (1) That the CCP be required to abandon its armed forces. (2) That the National Government be required to undertake thorough political and economic reforms. He seemed to want to use this document to pave the way for the National Government to request American aid, that is, to implement reforms. In fact, as far as these two points are concerned, they are not "new facts," and there was no need for a month-long investigation. The fact that the CCP is unwilling to voluntarily abandon its armed forces has long been known to China and the world. The principle that bandit suppression must be 70% political and 30% military was set by Chairman Chiang himself when he suppressed bandits in Jiangxi. Since the CCP cannot automatically lay down its weapons, the Chinese people must support the government in strengthening the work of bandit suppression, forcing the CCP to lay down its weapons before it is too late. As for the political and economic reforms undertaken by the government, they are being carried out step by step after the promulgation of the Constitution by the National Assembly. In the future, we can only seek to improve ourselves, strengthening our administrative efficiency and making our social customs more in line with the difficult wartime life.

However, while we do our best, we cannot but point out that the United States bears a moral responsibility for the brewing and expansion of the Chinese civil war. There are two reasons why the CCP bandits have grown so powerful: (1) They benefited from unrealistic "peace talks," which allowed them to expand their strength within a year. This urging of "peace talks" was precisely a highlight of the American government's policy toward China. (2) They benefited from the aid provided by the Soviet Union after it occupied Northeast China. The reason why the Soviet Union had this opportunity was due to the "selling out" of its Chinese ally by the United States at the Yalta Conference. Therefore, although we should deeply blame ourselves for the expansion of the civil war in China today, from the perspective of the indivisible international factors of peace, the United States should also bear a considerable responsibility. Wedemeyer did not analyze the facts that led to the CCP's rise, nor did he explain any concrete measures to resolve these facts. He merely issued some superficial platitudes, believing that the United States' temporary refusal to aid China, etc., would benefit the overall situation.

Taking a step back, we believe that Wedemeyer's farewell remarks were made with good intentions and can be regarded as his admonishment to the Chinese government. However, speaking in such a tone without waiting to return to the United States was unwise. The New York Times also stated that Wedemeyer's statement was tantamount to issuing an ultimatum to the Chinese government, ordering it to reform. Everything in China needs reform, but must all reforms be exactly as the American friends intend? Must the Chinese way of life be completely transformed into the American way of life? Must all the institutions of the Chinese government be completely changed into American institutions before they are satisfied? It must be understood that the reform of China's political economy is one thing, while America's desire to use "dollar diplomacy" to order China to accept its commands and teachings is another. Recently, Britain refused to accept American loans, and at the same time, the United States is becoming increasingly strict with the terms of its loans, either attaching political conditions or requiring supervision of their use. These facts make us gradually believe that the United States' loans to other countries are not based on the happiness of the people of those countries, nor are they focused on mutual benefit and the overall global situation, but are merely based on its own temporary interests. In fact, if the whole world is truly poor and there are no more "dollars," then the United States will face overproduction and will once again suffer a major economic crisis!

Now we must reflect on ourselves! We can learn many useful lessons from Wedemeyer's blunt statement. First, we Chinese people have always valued "loyalty" and "trust" in the way we make friends. We regard the United States as our close friend, believing that it should know how to "send charcoal in the snow," but we did not expect that the United States is just a friend who is "someone when there is trouble, and no one when there is no trouble." Second, under the current international situation, "international cooperation" and "world peace" are just slogans. If China wants to safeguard the integrity of its territorial sovereignty, it must constantly strive to become stronger and must not have any thoughts of relying on foreign countries. Third, under the condition of not harming sovereignty and national dignity, we can accept foreign aid, but we must not easily accept foreign loans unless absolutely necessary. There is a Chinese saying, "Even if we are poor, we must be tough." We are unwilling to eat food that is offered with contempt!

We must also thank Wedemeyer for his frank remarks, which have given us a deeper understanding of the United States! It has further deepened our belief in "self-reliance"!

### Former Head of Nazi Intelligence in North China Arrested in Beiping After Hiding for Two Years; Schmidt Escorted to Shanghai with Other German Nationals Yesterday

[United Press International, Beiping, 30th] Two American (C-47 type) transport planes took off from here on the 30th, carrying seventeen Nazi German nationals being repatriated, including family members. The pilots said that due to strong winds, they might be forced to land in Nanjing instead of flying directly to Shanghai. If the bad weather changes the flight path, these German nationals will travel from Nanjing to Shanghai by train or switch to a C-54 type plane, as the C-54 type plane is better able to cope with bad weather. Among those being evacuated was Schmidt, the former head of the Nazi "Gestapo" in North China. Schmidt went into hiding after Japan surrendered. After two years and eleven days of diligent investigation, Chinese officials finally captured him on the evening of the 29th in a cellar in the basement of a German woman's house. Schmidt's name is Yuheim, also known as Zhang Zong. He went to Tokyo when Germany surrendered and later returned to Beiping, where he went into hiding.

### Gong Guoliang Declared Innocent; Prosecutor Appeals for Retrial

[Our Suzhou Dispatch, 30th] Gong Guoliang, the former commander of the puppet Third Division, was previously declared innocent by the Criminal Division of the Jiangsu High Court because there was evidence of his defection. The prosecuting attorney believes that the defendant initially held the puppet position of pacification commander of the Suzhou area under the Renovation Government without central approval, and there is no record to be found. He also made absurd remarks in puppet newspapers, openly criticizing resistance against Japan as blind. He was later promoted to commander of the Third Division. Although he was sentenced to imprisonment for his defection, it is uncertain whether his defection was sincere or merely self-deception. The Criminal Division failed to conduct a thorough investigation and prematurely declared him innocent, which is difficult to accept. Therefore, on the 30th, they prepared a statement of reasons and applied to the Supreme Court to overturn the original judgment and order a retrial.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 30th] Diplomatic sources say that the proposal by the U.S. government to invite the Chinese, British, and Soviet governments to hold a four-nation conference in Washington to establish an independent and unified Korea was originally proposed by our government.

[Associated Press, Washington, 29th] The United States today convened a meeting of the four major Pacific powers to discuss thorough new proposals to break the U.S.-Soviet deadlock on the issue of Korean independence. Under Secretary of State Lovett sent a strong note to Moscow, inviting the Soviet Union to join the United States, Britain, and China in holding such a conference in Washington on September 8th. If the Soviet Union refuses, the United States may appeal to the United Nations or unilaterally strive to establish the economic strength of southern Korea. Regardless of the Soviet Union's decision, diplomatic officials have made it clear that the U.S. government is determined to break the Korean deadlock. Lovett's note was delivered to the Soviet government yesterday by U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union Smith in response to a note from Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov last Saturday. Lovett stated that according to the report of the U.S. representatives to the U.S.-Soviet Joint Commission on Korea, the Soviet representatives will not agree to any proposals to resolve the issue of Korean political groups expressing their opinions. The Soviet representatives insisted on unilateral privileges, excluding groups with dissenting opinions. This position "not only violates the agreement between you and Secretary of State Marshall but also violates the democratic principles of freedom of expression." Regarding Molotov's accusation that the United States is oppressing or mistreating Koreans, the note stated: The United States is responsible for maintaining law and order in southern Korea without interfering with democratic rights, which is fully demonstrated by the expression and respect for all political views in the U.S. occupation zone, etc.

### U.S. Presents Concrete Suggestions for Establishing a Korean Provisional Government

[United States Information Service, Washington, 29th] In his note to Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, Under Secretary of State Lovett presented the following U.S. suggestions regarding Korea: (1) General elections should be held as soon as possible in both the Soviet and U.S. occupation zones of Korea to elect fully representative provisional assemblies in each zone. Elections must be conducted according to the principles of universal suffrage, secret multi-party voting, and in accordance with the laws currently adopted by the Korean assemblies in each zone. (2) The number of members of the provisional district assemblies should be proportional to the population of the two zones. Then, all the members should form a national provisional assembly, which should meet in Seoul to establish a provisional government for a unified Korea. (3) The provisional government of this unified Korea should hold regular meetings with representatives of the four powers related to the Moscow Agreement on Korea to determine what kind of assistance and aid is needed to give Korea an independent, solid economic and political foundation, and what the conditions for this assistance and aid should be. (4) During the above stages, the United Nations should be invited to send observers to Korea so that the world and the Korean people can be sure that the actions taken are fully representative and fully independent. (5) The Korean provisional government and the four powers concerned should agree on a date for the complete withdrawal of all occupying forces in Korea. (6) The provisional assemblies in each zone should work to draft a provisional constitution, which will serve as a blueprint when the national assembly passes a Korean constitution for the entire Korea in the future. (7) Before the establishment of a unified and independent Korea, public and private institutions in each zone should maintain contact with the United Nations or various international institutions within the United Nations. At the same time, Korean representatives should be encouraged to attend formal international conferences under appropriate circumstances.

Dutch sources believe that Van Mook's statement implies that the Netherlands may launch a new offensive against the Indonesian capital, Yogyakarta, to strike at the Republican government. Van Mook also denounced the submission of the Indonesian issue to the United Nations as "an act that violates international law." Van Mook appealed to the world to recognize the current situation, saying, "Our responsibility cannot be restricted or usurped by resolutions or committees."

### Japanese Demand Return of Islands East of Hokkaido

They declared that the islands have belonged to Japan for more than 200 years. The islands they are demanding be returned include Kunashiri Island, Etorofu Island, and the Habomai Islands. The Hokkaido Prefectural Assembly first requested the return of the islands a month ago, resolving to petition MacArthur, requesting the return of the islands.

### Soviet Union Approves Peace Treaties with Five Nations

[Reuters, London, 29th] Moscow Radio said that the Supreme Soviet has approved the peace treaties with the five nations of Italy, Romania, Hungary, Finland, and Bulgaria.

[Reported by the News Agency] London, 30th Broadcast: According to well-informed sources in Paris, after the Soviet Union approved the peace treaties with the five nations, it is expected that the four powers will sign the peace treaty with Italy. The signing ceremony will be kept simple, with French Foreign Minister Bidault, British Ambassador to France Cooper, U.S. Ambassador Caffery, and Soviet Ambassador Bogomolov representing their respective governments in signing the treaty.

[Associated Press, Washington, 30th] U.S. officials were greatly surprised by the Soviet Union's approval of the peace treaties with the Axis satellite states, as they believed that the Soviet Union would delay the approval process for several months. A fear has arisen in diplomatic circles that after the British and American troops withdraw from Italy, the Soviets will take advantage of the situation. Currently, Britain and the United States have 20,000 troops stationed in Italy. The treaty stipulates that the Soviet Union may station an unspecified number of troops in Romania and Hungary to protect traffic with the Austrian occupation zone. It is not easy to reduce the number of Soviet troops stationed in these two countries, as the Soviet Union's plan to control the Austrian government is still in its early stages.

Large-Scale Gold Trading Case Cracked in Jinling East Road - Over a Thousand Taels of Gold Confiscated - Branch Offices Established in Major Ports - Principal Offender Attempts Bribery but is Refused [This Newspaper's Report] The Economic Section of the Police Bureau cracked a large-scale black market gold operation at 11:00 AM yesterday on the fourth floor of No. 41 Jinling East Road, confiscating over 1,200 taels of large and small gold bars on the spot. The principal offender, Yu Jixi from Xiamen, was also arrested. The police bureau put in a great deal of effort into cracking this case. After Economic Section Chief Xu Youzuo initially obtained this clue, he sent personnel to investigate. The results only revealed that the place was a company dealing in imported and exported cotton yarn industrial raw materials, named Yicheng. The people who went in and out were all upper-class figures, and for five days, no suspicious points could be found. Finally, Xu decided to go there himself in disguise, on the pretext of visiting a friend, to understand the truth. He then discovered that there were four suites inside. At that time, there was only one apprentice on duty in the outer room, seemingly waiting for someone, and an alarm bell was installed next to his writing desk. Seeing Xu arrive, he scrutinized him with surprised eyes and asked questions in detail. Xu responded vaguely and inadvertently noticed telegrams from Hong Kong and Macau on the table. However, the apprentice was very alert and quickly locked the telegrams in the drawer. Subsequently, Xu learned from the second landlord that the company had frequent correspondence, but there was no sign of any business activities.

Implementation of Search - At 11:00 AM yesterday, after Xu obtained approval from Director Ruan, he ordered officers Si Yun-kui, Wang Dong, Xiong Qu-jiao, and Xu Xiaoshu to go for a search. After breaking in, they first took out the telegrams and secret codes from the drawer. At the same time, they searched all the rooms and arrested the principal offender Yu Jixi in the last room, confiscating 72 large gold bars from Shanghai, 98 five-tael gold bars from Hong Kong, and about three taels of gold ornaments and small bars in a small box. In addition, they also found a scale and two specially made vests for carrying gold bars. On the other hand, they deciphered the original text of the secret telegram as "Currently being carried by two people, each carrying 150 taels. The rest is packed and shipped out." At this point, the principal offender Yu Jixi's face turned pale, and he knelt down and begged, offering a huge amount of gold bars as a bribe, but was refused by the police officers. He was then taken to the police station for interrogation.

According to Yu Jixi's confession, their organization has a background and is jointly operated by more than ten people, with branch offices set up in Ping, Jin, Hong Kong, Yue, and Ao. All the gold bars are smuggled from Hong Kong and Macau to Shanghai. Under his name, there are a total of 300 taels of gold bars, and the rest belong to others. He also said that he hopes the police bureau will not pursue the root cause.

As for the gold bars that have been seized, they were temporarily kept after being sealed by Police Bureau Chief Xu and Commissioner Wu of the Central Bank yesterday. After weighing them tomorrow, they will be sent to the Central Bank. The suspects are temporarily detained in the detention center, and the case will be reported to the Ministry of Finance for review.

General Mobilization Conference for the Cultural Sector to Suppress Rebellion and Save the Country Established Yesterday - Fully Encourage the Morale of the Soldiers on the Front Lines to Suppress Bandits - Awaken Society to Complete the Wartime System [This Newspaper's Report] The General Mobilization Conference for the Cultural Sector to Suppress Rebellion and Save the Country was held at the Cultural Center on Zhapu Road at 3:00 PM yesterday. Representatives from various agencies and cultural groups in the city, including the Xinhai Revolution Comrades Association, the Chinese Photographic Society, the Photography Reporters Association, the Book Industry Association, the Philosophy and Numerology Research Association, the Beijing Opera Theater Workers' Union, the Cantonese Opera Association, the Analects Society, the Dadong Bookstore, the Qianghua Sports Association, the Shanghai Academy of Fine Arts, and Nianhua Girls' High School, totaling more than 300 representatives from over 40 units, attended. The walls on both sides of the venue were decorated with more than a dozen cartoons of the atrocities of the Communist bandits, which were shocking. On the left and right sides of the rostrum were two large neon signs with the words "Suppress Rebellion and Build the Country, Cultural Mobilization," which were thought-provoking.

After the meeting began, Chairman Pan Gongzhan delivered a speech, saying: "After the victory, the Communist bandits used peace as a smokescreen to launch a rebellion. In order to put the country on the road to democracy and unification as soon as possible, the government repeatedly made concessions and negotiated with them in every way from last winter to this spring in order to quickly find a peaceful solution. However, the Communist bandits had no sincerity, expanded the war, and recently requested foreign aid, recklessly destroying with their inhuman violence. Their behavior is completely equivalent to the mob in history and the fifth column in the international community, and they are extremely insane. After compromising, the government saw that the Communist bandits were unrepentant, so it decided to order the suppression of the rebellion. The purpose of this suppression of the rebellion is to seek the real peaceful unification of the country, so it has won the support of the people of the whole country. The cultural sector is the hub of all work and should lead the people of the whole country to carry out a general mobilization in spirit and thought. On the one hand, we must fully encourage the morale of the soldiers on the front lines to suppress the bandits, and on the other hand, we must awaken society to abandon extravagant habits and complete the wartime system, focusing all our energy on suppressing the rebellion, so that the country can achieve stability as soon as possible. With so many cultural groups in Shanghai at present, if we can be of one heart and one mind, the impact on the whole country in the future will be great, so I hope that people in the cultural sector will earnestly shoulder this important mission of the times."

After everyone stood up and silently mourned the soldiers who died in the suppression of the bandits for three minutes, Zhang Daofan, Chairman of the Central Cultural Movement Committee, and Fang Zhi, Chairman of the Municipal Party Headquarters, delivered speeches respectively, elaborating on the goals of the general mobilization of the cultural sector in detail. Finally, the organizational outline was discussed and the persons in charge of each group were elected, and the meeting adjourned at 4:30 PM with shouts of slogans. After the meeting, a declaration was issued, a telegram of respect was sent to Chairman Chiang, and a circular telegram was sent to the cultural sector across the country.

Scalpers Active in Front of Theaters - Black Market Ticket Prices Tripled - Audience Complains [This Newspaper's Report] Movie theaters have been preparing to raise prices for a long time, and it was rumored for a time that the new ticket prices would be implemented on September 1. Although the film merchants and the Social Affairs Bureau have not yet reached an agreement, the price increase principle has been agreed to by the authorities, and adjusting the ticket price is only a matter of time. Most movie fans are unwilling to give up this last chance, so movie theaters in the city have been particularly crowded in recent days, and scalpers have taken advantage of this to engage in major activities, especially on the weekend yesterday, which was even more rampant. At 8:00 AM, before the theaters opened, the scalpers were already lined up waiting. When ticket sales started at 9:30 AM, the scalpers rushed in and immediately sold out all the upstairs and downstairs tickets for all four screenings of the day. Yesterday morning, reporters patrolled the major theaters and found that all screenings for the next two days were full by about 10:00 AM, and all the tickets were taken over by scalpers, even the early screenings on Sunday were not spared. According to the investigation, the black market price of a night show ticket at 9:15 was as high as 30,000 yuan (original price 12,000), and the ordinary price was also doubled. The audience complained that the police and security authorities did not take any action to crack down. It is understood that the daily income of "scalpers" often reaches 200,000 to 300,000 yuan, and after deducting the necessary "expenses," the net income of 4 to 5 million yuan per month is very common. However, they are also quite organized, with the scope of activities divided into regions, and it is extremely difficult for outsiders to participate.

Dramatic Incident of Robbers Resisting Arrest - Police Inspectors and Sergeants Nearly Assassinated - Bullets Flying on Yuezhou Road, Five Criminals Apprehended [This Newspaper's Report] Ying Liangyuan, a resident of No. 15 Qin'yi North Lane, Yuezhou Road, Shanghai, is an accountant at Hongchang New Cotton Cloth Shop. The upstairs is rented to the Cao family. At about 9:00 AM yesterday, five robbers suddenly came. Two of them had Mauser pistols, and one had a wooden-cased gun. They forcibly took two gold rings and three inlaid gemstone rings from the hands of Ying's old wife and daughter-in-law. After driving the women and children into the back room of the living room, they tied them up with ropes, searched for the keys, and went upstairs to steal gold and silver jewelry, clothes, and clocks. At the same time, the Cao family's room was also looted. Coincidentally, Ying's younger sister-in-law returned from outside and noticed that the back door was closed and heard rude noises. Realizing that something was wrong, she turned around and ran out of the lane. She happened to meet Cao Chen, the landlady upstairs, who told her about the robbery. Cao Chen and others reported to the nearby police. Upon receiving the report, Fu Sugang, the director of the Tilanqiao Police Precinct, immediately ordered Ma Zhuyu, the head of the Criminal Investigation Section, to lead Police Inspectors Lin Jiyi and Yu Yingkai, Police Sergeants Gao Fuhou and Ding Yichen, and Police Officers Zhang Shukai and Chen Dianzeng to drive two motorcycles to the lane entrance. They saw two robbers at the back door of No. 15, and one robber immediately pulled out a gun and fired at Police Inspector Lin, but fortunately missed. He then fired two shots at Police Sergeant Gao, who fell to the ground to avoid the bullets and escaped unharmed, but his police hat was pierced with a hole. He then returned fire, hitting the robber in the right arm. The two robbers were eventually captured. Soon after, Director Fu, along with Deputy Director Wang Xiweng, the chiefs of the First and Third Sections, and a large number of uniformed police officers, arrived in jeep-style police vehicles. They first cordoned off the lane entrance, cutting off traffic on the road. At this time, the third robber opened the front door with the help of the fourth robber in an attempt to escape. Police Sergeant Ding fired more than ten rounds from a Thompson submachine gun, and the two robbers were captured. All the stolen gold jewelry was recovered. When being escorted onto the police car, the third robber attempted to escape, but Deputy Director Wang fired several shots in the air, although not hitting him, and he surrendered and was escorted onto the prisoner transport vehicle. The fifth robber was apprehended after a search of more than ten minutes by all the police officers, and a wooden-cased gun and seven bullets were seized.

Understanding the Pain of Dropping Out of School, Helping Others Is the Source of Happiness - Jin Lianghong Saves Money on Leather Shoes to Respond to the Scholarship Assistance [This Newspaper's Report] Regarding the fundraising campaign for the reader scholarship assistance program launched by this newspaper, after publishing Shen Wenhua's letter yesterday, the newspaper received 200,000 yuan donated by reader Jin Lianghong yesterday, along with a letter as follows: "Editor: After reading Mr. Shen Wenhua's letter in the newspaper today, I was greatly moved. I express my deepest sympathy to Mr. Shen and the students who have suffered the same fate as Mr. Shen. I am currently studying medicine at a church university. My father is the chief accountant of a bank. Although our family cannot be called 'rich,' it can be considered a 'comfortable family.' I remember ten years ago, the flames of the War of Resistance forced us to flee from other cities to Shanghai. At that time, my father lost his job and became ill. The savings of several years were all spent on fleeing, and the family's financial situation fell into extreme distress. At that time, I was only in the fifth grade of elementary school. I remember that I also dropped out of school for two years because I couldn't pay the sixteen yuan tuition fee, otherwise I would have graduated this year. Although eight years have passed, that desolate scene has always been etched in my mind.

School is about to start, and although I no longer have to worry about 'tuition fees,' I understand the pain of dropping out of school and know the taste of it. Now, I have saved 200,000 yuan from the money for leather shoes and donated it to your newspaper's scholarship assistance program as a small contribution. Although there is a big hole in the sole of my leather shoes, I feel extra comfort in my heart. Best wishes. Yu Lianghong"

The scholarship donations received yesterday are as follows:

Ordinary Team - Team 26, Yu Lianghong Scholarship Team: 200,000 yuan Team 27, Shen Liuchun Congratulates Shen Bao 75th Anniversary Team: 200,000 yuan

The Revelation of Goethe's Personality in Spring and Autumn
By Yan Zhewu - Written for Goethe's Birthday on August 28th

A glance at the history of world literature reveals four epoch-making and great poets in Europe, both ancient and modern: Homer in ancient times, Dante in the 13th century, Shakespeare in the 16th century, and Goethe in the 18th century, a versatile genius who was as famous as Napoleon.

Goethe was born on August 28, 1749. In Germany, and even in the Soviet Union and various European countries, grand celebrations and commemorations are held on this day. He is indeed an unparalleled literary genius and a saint in the German literary world. Before Goethe emerged, Germany was always regarded by France and other European countries as "the most foolish nation," but after Goethe was discovered, he was hailed as "the jade of the European literary world." Even Napoleon said, "This is truly a man!"

Goethe's life was marked by vast knowledge and versatility. He was a statesman, thinker, scientist, and poet; he was a color theorist, zoologist, mineralogist, botanist, and geologist. He studied philosophy, law, and medicine, yet his entire personality was fully expressed in his lifelong literary works. He experienced and explored various aspects of life, but in all his endeavors, he never lost his "self"!

The complete Goethean personality is, in fact, the continuous completion of countless Goethes. The young Goethe was different from the old Goethe, and from youth to old age, there was Goethe the university student, Goethe of The Sorrows of Young Werther, Goethe of the Weimar court, Goethe traveling in Italy, Goethe in conversation with Schiller, Goethe the saint in conversation with Eckermann... and each change in Goethe's life revealed a significant meaning in human life.

Goethe's life was one of eternal change, but when he developed a new inclination towards each new life, he immersed himself in it with all his spirit and personality. His life's thoughts, emotions, and intellect were constantly in contradiction, conflict, distress, and dissatisfaction, but in the end, he always resolutely abandoned the old and retreated bravely, even more courageously entering into another new pursuit. Therefore, it can be said that Goethe's life was not a journey from error to truth, but a continuous experience of all kinds of forms of human life. This eternal change of personality was also confessed in Goethe's "Faust":

"I want to deeply experience within my inner self, to experience everything that all mankind is endowed with, the most sublime and the most profound I must understand, I want to pile up the joys and sorrows of all mankind in my chest, my ego will expand to become the great self of all mankind. I wish to perish together with all mankind in the end."

This kind of great pursuit of a diversified life, affirming the meaning of life, constantly pursuing, making contradictions often return to harmony, and optimistically clinging to the ever-changing phenomena, enduring all joys and sorrows, daring to throw oneself into the rush of the times and under the wheels of events, and forever facing the future, holding the reins of the galloping destiny, driving forward towards the endless. This spirit of a warrior on the battlefield of life is also the shining light of a poet, and it is truly worthy of our respect and learning.

### Crying for Mother
By Tian Di - Also Accusing the Crimes of the Chinese Communist Party

"In the deep night of July 25, 1946 (June 27th in the lunar calendar), Tian Yuan Chuanyun, a fifty-year-old woman, along with three other elderly victims, were innocently shot in the area controlled by the Chinese Communist Party at the time, the ancient city of Lai'an, in the so-called Suwan Border Region Government. This is just one of the countless massacres committed by the Chinese Communist Party in eastern Anhui..."

Last summer, on a stormy night, within the so-called Suwan Liberated Area—the ancient city of Lai'an County—my dear mother, a kind and gentle old woman, was shot by Chinese Communist Party members who used slogans such as advancement, revolution, and liberation as a guise, groundlessly shooting an old woman who had no political influence and no ability to resist. This is a

painful tragedy and a debt of blood.

Years have passed. Tonight, it is again a storm of wind and rain. I turn off the lights and sit quietly by the window. It is as if I hear my mother's desperate cries for help before her execution in the sound of ten thousand horses galloping in the rain. I faintly smell the thick scent of blood! It is as if I see my mother's blood gushing out of her wounds on the vast wilderness... Time only deepens my painful memory, arousing my hatred, anger, and endless sorrow!

I have been separated from my mother for eight years. In these long and protracted years, my mother, with the spirit of a martyr, guarded the dilapidated countryside and the broken home. Under the Chinese Communist Party's various forms of oppression, humiliation, and all-out control, she lived a life of poverty and hardship, living the life of an ox or horse, suffering humiliation and harm. Watching her children, like fledglings learning to fly, one after another leave the nest, her late years were marked by poverty and illness, just like the ancient cypress tree outside the gate of her old residence, which was burned to death by the carelessness of the Chinese Communist Party during the "false clearing" of houses. For a long time, only withered branches remained standing, lonely passing away her dim days; watching her fifth son die young, watching our elder sisters, one by one, like kites with broken strings, unable to find any news, watching life become more and more difficult day by day, eating black wheat, ground fungus, and tree bark while having to rush to make "army shoes"... Why was my mother able to endure such hardship and iron torture with pleasure? Wasn't it a great belief, a bright vision that encouraged her old age's courage to live? That is: "There will always be a day when the devils are defeated, and my husband and children will return one after another, and we will relive the life of family reunion before the war!"

Indeed, victory has come, but happiness does not belong to us. Our mother was brutally shot to death by people, by bandits, by the most cruel executioners in the world. When we were able to enter our old home, besides tracing the outline of our mother's life from the dilapidated walls, our mother left this world with a coffin full of tears and grievances. Besides kneeling in front of the overgrown grave and weeping bitterly, how can we repay the mother who raised us, and even more, how can we avenge the mother and those who suffered the same tragic fate as her!

In a thatched cottage, seeing my grandmother, who was dying and lingering on her sickbed, we held back our rolling tears. My grandmother tried hard to open her lifeless eyes. My grandmother's shoulders twitched, and old tears streamed down her face. Her dry mouth muttered softly: "Children: you have come too late, you will never see your mother again..."

After that, after many inquiries, we learned that my mother was monitored even more strictly after the enemy surrendered, as if they were afraid that she would enter the free area. Therefore, two months before her martyrdom, she had a painful conversation with an elderly relative: "If Tang'er comes back, I'm afraid mother and son will never see each other again!" It can be seen that my mother knew at that time that she could not escape death, but why didn't she leave this den of tigers immediately? And why did she die? She didn't think that, in her heart, wasn't it because she was ill and didn't have the courage to endure the suffering of life, especially fearing that the Communist area would not be easily recovered for a while, and if she dragged on for a few more years, she would also be dragged to death? How could she have thought that she would be killed like a pure and kind old sheep, otherwise, I think my mother must have tried to escape!

Who in the world is without a mother? If the Chinese Communist Party members have any humanity left, they should never have committed such a vicious and stupid massacre. Putting themselves in her place, if the mothers of Mao Zedong and his party members were innocently killed, and they suffered the pain of losing their mothers, what would they think? This is an irreconcilable hatred. Why do they allow their party members to be so vicious and evil?

After several repressions, standing on the position of a journalist, initially, in order to take care of the peace of the whole country, I was unwilling to announce this ironclad fact, this painful tragedy, to the people of the country, for fear of being considered alarmist. I once held back tears, bearing sorrow, and enduring anger, and interviewed back and forth among the various parties participating in the peace talks, my only hope being: that when peace is realized, weapons of war can be transformed into jade and silk, and the murderers can be brought to justice under the majestic law. But the facts have disappointed us! Since I cannot seek the arrest of the murderer for my mother under the unified and peaceful situation, then I can only ask for help from the world, from compatriots who truly love democracy and freedom and safeguard the country and the nation. I believe that I am just one of the millions who have suffered such unfortunate encounters. I accuse the crimes of the Chinese Communist Party!

Countrymen, we must investigate the debt of blood! We must prevent these tragic events from being staged indefinitely on the land of our motherland! We demand that the law arrest the murderer for me, demand that the government protect our most basic life, we support the General Mobilization Order for the Suppression of the Rebellion, we want to accuse the world, the Chinese Communist Party is not only an armed rebel bandit gang, but also a butcher who destroys human nature! (Revised in July during a journey in Liuhe)

### Su Wu Herding Sheep (Woodcut)
By Zhao Jingshen - The New Work of Sinclair Lewis

Who would have thought that the son of old Doc Lewis, Harry Lewis, whose nickname is Doodle, would have today's achievements. He worked as a night clerk in a hotel in Sauk Centre, Minnesota. Later, he worked for the local "Weekly," "New Haven Journal-Courier," and the San Francisco "Bulletin." The manager of the Bulletin even suspended him, saying he was an incompetent interviewer. He was ugly, with a face full of freckles and red hair, but he could interview beautiful yarn. At Yale University, he wrote poetry and edited "Lit," and later stoked the stove for Sinclair. He lived in New York, worked as a social worker, and also worked as a secretary for two female writers, selling novels and newspapers. From 1914 to 1919, he wrote five novels that people have forgotten. In 1920, his "Main Street" was published, and he finally gained a reputation. Two years later, "Babbitt" increased his reputation. Later, he published "Elmer Gantry," "Arrowsmith" (for which he refused the Pulitzer Prize), "Dodsworth," "Ann Vickers," and "It Can't Happen Here." He was the first Nobel Prize in Literature winner. He divorced twice, the first time from Grace Hegger, and the second time from Dorothy Thompson. His two sons, Wells, died in battle; Mickael is a tall man and is still in school. Whether working or playing, his strength is atomic. He also wrote a play called "Our Town," and may write another play soon.

Recently, Lewis (Sinclair Lewis) has written another book, "Kingsblood Royal," which is his twentieth novel. Don't think that this is another novel about the black slave problem, in fact, it is not just about the black slave problem, but a novel about the American problem. The general idea is that Kingsblood is a tall, red-haired American who works as an assistant accountant at the Second National Bank of the Republic of Minnesota. If the author had let him become the bank manager, achieve success, and nothing unpleasant happened, and he died peacefully, there would be nothing surprising. However, Kingsblood discovered that there were invisible chemical traces of black people in his skin. He looked for his family tree and found that his mother's family was a descendant of black people. He himself is the thirty-second generation of this black man.

After the discovery, Kingsblood had three paths to take: first, he could hide what he knew. Second, he could still claim to be white and work secretly for black people. Third, he could announce to the public that he was a descendant of black people. Later, he observed black people and felt that the general public's views on how good or bad black people are were biased. There are good people and bad people among black people; there are dirty people and clean people; there are ugly people and beautiful people, just like Americans. They don't want people to like them, praise them, nor do they want people to fear them, torture them. Black people only want to be treated as ordinary people. They are willing to be Babbitts, Elmer Gantrys, Arrowsmiths, Ann Vickerses, or Kingsbloods. They don't want to be seen as too high or too low. They have no special virtues, nor special sins.

Americans are also beginning to understand, but only in their hearts. Americans should see black people as having no racial distinction and as being the same as themselves, so I say this is America's problem.

### An Inch of Mountain and River, an Inch of Blood
By Ye Jingfeng 883

Yaoqun was fine, of course, she greeted everyone with the old routine, asking after each other's well-being, but this little tiger suffered.

Child… come here!

Although Grandma didn't rest for half the night, her spirit was not diminished at all. As soon as she saw her son, he was still so… still that… good, from head to toe, nothing more. Nothing was missing at all, and she was relieved. Her heart was full of joy, needless to say, but besides her face and eyebrows being full of smiles, there were also two lines of hot tears: "Child… even if you are a squad leader, aren't you? Big or small, you are still an official… You can't do it with your little ability, can you? … Come! … Although you have traveled thousands of miles and come back from so far away, you must be tired, right? But we can't be rude… First, pay your respects to Aunt Ji and tell her 'excuse me,' then kowtow to your uncle… you also have to kowtow to these uncles, grand-uncles, uncles, grandmothers, and aunts… Then go to the hall with your mother, and all the elders of the grandfather's generation are waiting there, you all have to… later…

There is also your grandfather's spirit tablet in the room… and your father's tablet!…" Statistically, there were about one hundred and forty-five kowtows.

Yaoqun only planned to stay in the village for one day, so after the welcoming reception and other events ended, she immediately invited Lord Long Wu and several head officials to the council hall to speak. This was the only goal of her trip.

"Young lady, you can't be polite with us," Lord Long Wu immediately interjected as soon as Yaoqun opened her mouth; "Whatever you say is good; even if we move the entire village to the customs, it's fine…!"

"That's what you say, Fifth Lord;" Yaoqun was preparing to express her plan: "The problem is not that simple. If it were that simple, why would I bother to make this trip? I could just send you a letter, right? … This is the old village, and this foundation is all made with blood and sweat… Moreover, both inside and outside the customs are equally important. My intention is to see if you can transfer twenty or thirty guys; but you can't just consider my side; this is not a matter of politeness… The people must also be selected, and it is important to solicit their consent, and everyone still has their own family problems, right?…"

As a result of the conversation, Yaoqun and Lord Long Wu established a rational approach; first, solicit the opinions of one positive and one deputy captain, give them a standard for selecting personnel, and let them recruit four squad leaders. Then, each squad leader would recruit four or five team members, adding up to almost thirty people in the entire team. This number sounds small, but the old village's guerrilla teams have never exceeded this number each time, which shows that their quality is top-notch, capable of standing up to a hundred.

Just as this recruitment method was decided, someone stood up from the official seat, raised a loudspeaker-like voice, and first coughed dryly, clearing the phlegm on his vocal cords:

"This task should simply be handed over to me and my brother Wu…" While speaking, Old Long struck a brave and heroic pose, giving a sweeping salute to all the councilors; this demeanor, in the terminology of Peking opera, was done very "skillfully," quite like Ma Yulong in "Tongjiawu" raising his "head," only lacking the gongs and drums of "bala qinqiang, zha, zha, zha…"

After saying this, Old Long opened his eyes as wide as possible, showing a heroic spirit, and glanced at Lord Long Wu and Yaoqun, etc., one by one, to see everyone's reaction to his request; at the end, he redirected his gaze back to Lord Long Wu and Yaoqun; and then put both hands together, making a gesture of ten.

### The World Divided into Two Major Blocs: Eisenhower Issues a Frank Warning

[Reuters, New York, 29th] General Dwight D. Eisenhower, U.S. Army Chief of Staff, addressed the American Military Order Association today, frankly pointing out that the world is already divided into two major blocs. He said that in order to maintain world peace, a strong United States is essential. To make the United States strong, universal military training must be promoted. Eisenhower stated: "We must recognize that the spirit of cooperation has been lost in the two years since the war, and the world is now divided into two major blocs. One is a bloc centered on a dictatorial system, under which the individual must submit to absolute control. The other is a bloc centered on a democratic system, which will give freedom to the individual." Eisenhower went on to say that he did not believe there was an immediate threat of another world war, as no major power in the world today hoped to gain anything from initiating a war. However, foresight and concentrated efforts are still necessary to maintain an adequate defensive posture at all times.
