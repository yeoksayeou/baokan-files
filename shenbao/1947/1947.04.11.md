Travelers from the south say that communist raiding teams are still lying in ambush to sabotage transportation, so travel is only possible during the day. The hundreds of kilometers of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway between Jinan and Xuzhou are lacking rails and other materials, and repairs are inevitably slow. Even the most optimistic people say that traffic between Jinan and Nanjing cannot be smooth until after the decisive battle in central Shandong and the main force of the communist forces is defeated.

### Meeting of the Directors of the Four Banks Joint Treasury Handles Cases Such as Silk Industry Revival; U.S. Dollar Bonds Adopt a Voluntary Solicitation Method

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 10th] The 341st board meeting of the Four Banks Joint Treasury was held on the morning of the 10th, presided over by Vice Wang Hongjun. In addition to approving more than 70 loan cases, three temporary motions were passed: (1) In order to guide the surplus social funds to engage in construction projects and balance fiscal revenue and expenditure, the government decided to issue U.S. dollar bonds and U.S. dollar treasury bills, adopting a voluntary solicitation method for widespread sales. National banks should take the lead in launching solicitations to promote this. It was resolved that in addition to national banks and all employees actively purchasing and selling, public and private production enterprises applying for loans from various banks in the future should be encouraged to solicit sales of bonds or treasury bills. It was also resolved to organize a bond solicitation research group to plan and implement, appointing Liu Gongyun, Cai Gongchun, Tang Xiaoqi, Zhu Tongjiu, Li Shuming, Wu Rencang, Gu Chunfan, Shou Miancheng, Chen Bingzhang, Dong Puming, Diao Minren, Tian Ding'an, and nineteen others as members, designating Liu Gongyun and Li Shuming as conveners. (2) The Joint Treasury has approved large loans to the silk industry in various places over the years. This year, Sichuan Silk Company and the silk industry in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and other provinces have applied for loans again. According to last year's situation, the sales of domestic raw silk in foreign markets were not smooth. The reason is that the cost is too high and the selling price is too expensive, which affects sales. However, raw silk is China's main export commodity and still needs active assistance. At present, silk mills in coastal areas have been severely damaged by the Japanese during the period of occupation, and it is difficult to resume production. If the Japanese silk industry actively develops in the future, the future of China's silk industry will face the impact of Japanese silk competition. It seems that the competent authorities should find ways to solve this difficulty to facilitate the revival of the silk industry. It was resolved to request the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Export Promotion Committee to study and plan separately and to negotiate with relevant friendly countries to safeguard the normal development of China's silk industry. (3) The Joint Treasury has approved a large number of loans to public and private production enterprises over the years. According to the "Coordinated Promotion Program for Assisting Production and Sales of Daily Necessities and Export Commodities," the production enterprises that have received loans should increase production in accordance with the predetermined plan and sell finished products at prices announced by the government in order to assist the government in stabilizing prices. It was resolved that the borrowing agencies of each production enterprise should report the output and selling price to the Joint Treasury for verification at any time after receiving the loan. If it is a production and sales enterprise for export commodities, it should also report the export and foreign exchange settlement situation together to facilitate assessment. Finally, since the government implemented the method of rationing daily necessities in March, employees of various national banks have not yet received in-kind rations. It should be handled uniformly immediately. It was resolved that the difference in the value of the in-kind rations should be issued by each bank and bureau, and no other names should be created.

(3) Measures to stabilize wages in Tianjin City. After discussion, it was decided to use the prices of six items distributed as the standard for stabilization. (4) How to coordinate and reserve fuel in the Nanjing and Shanghai area. It was resolved that the reason for the coal shortage is that too little coal is coming from Taiwan and North China.

### Shanghai Reporters Return from Jiangsu; Inspection Team Observes North China; Talk of the People's Suffering in Northern Jiangsu; Communist Troops Flee East and West Along the Coast; Local Grassroots Administration is Unsound

[Our Dispatch] A group of nineteen Shanghai reporters who visited Northern Jiangsu returned to Shanghai yesterday. The trip lasted nine days and visited Nantong, Haimen, Rugao, Dongtai, and other places. Although it was a fleeting visit, generally speaking, the people in the countryside are suffering unspeakable hardships, and the number of people fleeing to other places is increasing daily. In addition to guarding the points and lines, the communist troops appear and disappear unpredictably in other areas. Although a corner of the city or town appears to be peaceful, it is difficult to move only one or two li away from the city, and it is even more terrifying at night. This phenomenon is particularly evident in Dongtai, Rugao, and Yancheng.

The Battle of Libao

The communist troops recently launched a relatively large-scale raid and attacked Libao, northeast of Rugao. The battle began at 9:00 AM on the 2nd of this month. The communist troops launched an all-out attack with eleven regiments. At that time, the garrison only had one battalion to fight. Relying on the strength of their firepower, they forced the communist troops to suffer heavy casualties. By dawn on the 3rd, the communist troops used "militia" as a vanguard and approached the earthen walls around Libao. By daytime, they had entered the streets and launched a fierce street battle. At that time, the National Army had retreated to a stronghold in the southeast corner, waiting for reinforcements to arrive. At this point, the National Army transferred two regiments of troops from Dingjiaao and Baohekou to join the siege. On the 5th, they finally repelled all of them. In this battle, the National Army suffered more than 900 casualties, while the communist troops suffered more than 3,000 casualties. The weapons used by the communist troops this time included Russian-style machine guns and a small number of mortars. After the battle, the National Army captured more than 20 machine guns and more than 200 rifles. According to Wang Tiehan, the division commander who commanded the battle, the communist troops' large-scale invasion came from the sea. Currently, the communist troops have more than 300 large sailboats in the coastal areas of Northern Jiangsu, fleeing east and west unpredictably. Moreover, because the communist troops' political work is pervasive, they act extremely flexibly, often avoiding the main force of the National Army and focusing on eliminating local armed forces.

When the Green Crops Appear

Now, the people are increasingly fearful as the time when the green crops appear is approaching. The National Army also attaches great importance to this issue. However, Li Moan, the Pacification Commander, believes that the current situation in Northern Jiangsu is three parts military and seven parts political. If the communist troops are to be cleared before the green crops appear, the people's self-defense forces must be strengthened. He also said: "We must not ignore Northern Jiangsu, nor can we think that it is already peaceful, nor can we overestimate the communist troops, thinking that the chaos in Northern Jiangsu will never end."

Multiple Layers of Exploitation

As for local administration, due to the unsoundness of the grassroots level, all work cannot be promoted smoothly. In the countryside, because "bad people" are in power, the people are almost unable to make a living. There are many types of apportioned taxes and donations. Local ruffians and hooligans take the opportunity to rise up, extorting and blackmailing in endless ways. In addition, the security team has broken discipline, and the people are particularly dissatisfied with this, which is heartbreaking to hear.

Military Situation

A certain military officer sighed and said: What is hoped for is three parts military and seven parts political, but in reality, it is the opposite. The current actual situation is seven parts military and three parts political, which is far from ideal. He also compared the military and political work of our army and the communist army, saying that the situation on both sides is like a "triangular pyramid." The tip of the communist army is political work, and then they use force. Our side is the opposite, and the effect is greatly reduced.

In addition, when various counties in Northern Jiangsu are singing the praises of implementing land reform policies, in the current situation, it is only a piece of paper, and the actual problem is still far away. In short, this trip to Northern Jiangsu is full of bunkers and a solemn atmosphere. Although the wheat is verdant and the peach blossoms are red on both sides of the highway, after comparing them, the strong atmosphere of war greatly diminishes the mood.

### Syngman Rhee Went to Nanjing Last Night; After Meeting with the Chairman, He Will Return to Shanghai and Fly to Seoul; Various Groups in Shanghai Gave a Public Banquet for Mr. Rhee Yesterday Afternoon

[Our Dispatch] Dr. Syngman Rhee, the Korean revolutionary leader, arrived in Shanghai from the United States the day before yesterday and was warmly welcomed by all walks of life. Mr. Rhee took the night express train to Nanjing at 11:20 PM last night to wait for an audience with the Chairman. Then he will take the train back to Shanghai and fly back to Seoul. Accompanying Mr. Rhee were Secretary Zhang Jiyong, Legislator Situ De, and Min Seokrin, the leader of the Korean delegation, and other nine people. Chen Bozhuang, Director of the Two Roads Administration, sent them off at the station.

Li Shizeng's Speech

Yesterday noon, more than 20 representatives from all walks of life, including Xu Jiguang, Wang Zhuyi, Feng Youzhen, Qian Jianqiu, Xie Renliu, and Li Fuxun, held a banquet for Mr. Rhee at the Fengzelou of the International Hotel. At 4:00 PM, 21 groups from the Municipal Government, Municipal Party Headquarters, Senate, Sino-Korean Cultural Association, National Foreign Association, Municipal Women's Association, Chamber of Commerce, General Labor Union, and Journalists Association jointly held a cocktail party on the 14th floor of the International Hotel to receive Mr. Rhee. Li Shizeng served as chairman and delivered a welcoming speech, praising Dr. Rhee's spirit of working hard for the revolutionary movement and recounting Dr. Rhee's efforts abroad during the Anti-Japanese War to engage in anti-aggression work.

Syngman Rhee's Speech

Then, Dr. Rhee delivered a speech, first thanking the 21 groups in the city for their warm reception, and then saying: In the future, the friendship between the Korean people and the Chinese people will be even closer. He hopes that when everyone comes to Korea in the future, the Korean people will also have the opportunity to repay the hospitality. He is quite tired from this trip to China from the United States and cannot say everything, but he hopes that after returning home, he can organize the government, develop Korea's diplomatic, economic, and other positions, so that Korea can also become a strong member in the Far East. If China and Korea work together hand in hand, the future of peace in the Far East will be optimistic.

Wang Xiaolai's Speech

Wang Xiaolai also stood up and gave a speech, expressing his admiration for Dr. Rhee, and saying: If a country wants to be strong and the people healthy, economic growth is an important factor. China and Korea have been cooperating very well during the war. In the future, they should not only continue to cooperate politically, but also trade with each other commercially to enhance the economies of the two countries.

Xi Yushu, representing the National Foreign Association, welcomed Mr. Rhee and also stated that this welcome to Mr. Rhee is of great significance. The meeting of the leaders of China and Korea will lay the foundation for a permanent friendship between the two countries for generations to come. China and Korea have been oppressed by foreign forces in the past century. This time, the Anti-Japanese War achieved victory, and the two countries have great value. In the future, whether it is the governments or the people of the two countries, they should cooperate sincerely. Mr. Rhee's return to his country this time to organize the government will require great effort. Before the Korean government is formally established, we hope that we can give it the greatest sympathy and strong assistance.

Ms. Qian Jianqiu, representing the women of this city, paid tribute to Mr. Rhee and hoped that the women of China and Korea would also help each other and cooperate in the future.

At 7:00 PM yesterday, the Korean Overseas Chinese Association held a banquet for Mr. Rhee at the Navy YMCA, with Xu Binghao serving as chairman.

### The Mystery of US Loans to Korea; The US State Department Denies Syngman Rhee's Talks in Shanghai; Chairman of the Korean Affairs Research Association Accuses Rhee of Spreading Rumors

[Our Dispatch] When Korean revolutionary leader Dr. Syngman Rhee came to Shanghai the day before yesterday, he revealed to reporters in this city that President Truman of the United States had agreed to provide Korea with a loan of 600 million yuan in gold for construction and reconstruction. When this news reached Washington, the US State Department spokesperson formally denied yesterday that the loan had been formally approved by the US authorities. When reporters asked Dr. Rhee about the denial from Washington yesterday, Dr. Rhee stated again that he had indeed discussed the loan with President Truman in the United States. Although President Truman did not determine the amount of the loan at that time, he had in principle agreed to the Korean economic assistance plan and had stated that after the Korean government was formally established, the US government could provide South Korea with a loan of about 600 million US dollars.

[United Press Washington, 9th] A State Department official today denied Syngman Rhee's statement to reporters in Shanghai yesterday that the United States had decided to grant Korea a loan of $600 million, saying that the US government was drafting a Korean reconstruction plan, but the total amount of funds and other issues had not yet been decided. The funds seemed to be far less than the amount of $600 million. A few weeks ago, the State Department hinted that it would formulate a three-year Korean reconstruction plan.

[Associated Press Washington, 9th] Kim Young-in (transliteration), chairman of the Korean Affairs Research Association, today referred to the statement made by Korean political leader Syngman Rhee in Shanghai that "the United States is prepared to lend Korea 600 million US dollars" as entirely fabricated. Kim also said: "The amount should be between 400 million and 600 million US dollars, but the United States will use it for the reconstruction of the Korean economy and is not a loan at all. Syngman Rhee made this statement in an attempt to increase his personal prestige and to take credit for obtaining the loan, but Korea does not need this loan."

Our Consul General Shen Zuzheng here stated that our embassy and consulate have been informed of the matter. He also said that the Philippine Immigration Bureau had requested the Chinese authorities to share the living expenses and boat fare of the sixty-eight Chinese currently in detention. According to Philippine Immigration Bureau Director Ribeiro yesterday, the Chinese embassy should bear all the expenses, because "the responsibility of the embassy is to take care of the overseas Chinese here." A prominent overseas Chinese said: Ribeiro's words mean that the Philippine government hopes that the Chinese government or overseas Chinese taxpayers will bear all the expenses of enforcing Philippine immigration laws.

Editorial

### Countermeasures for Stabilizing Prices

The Shanghai Municipal Price Review Council was officially established yesterday. At a time when prices are on the verge of rising, the formal establishment of the council and the convening of its first meeting have drawn keen expectations from all sides.

According to the "Implementation Measures for Price Review," the council has two functions: (1) to review the prices of essential daily necessities; and (2) to assist in reporting violations of agreed-upon prices. Therefore, its evaluation targets have been defined as essential daily necessities, and the means it employs is price negotiation rather than price control. The standards for price negotiation are clearly stated: profits may be added to the cost of goods at appropriate rates, in accordance with local industry practices. In addition to manufacturing costs or the original purchase price, the calculation of costs may include interest, taxes, transportation costs, warehouse rent, management fees, insurance, depreciation, etc. However, if any of the above items undergoes drastic changes, a re-evaluation will inevitably be necessary to ensure compliance with costs and profits. Article 13 of the "Implementation Measures" has clearly stipulated this point. Therefore, the outcome of implementing price negotiation is not what people generally expect – to completely curb the rising trend or reduce prices to a certain level. Its greatest effect is simply to impose limitations on time and price, preventing excessive and continuous price increases. In other words, its role is one of mitigation, not suppression, and its approach is to adopt measures of continuous adjustment, rather than making rigid and immutable stipulations. Therefore, the outcome of price negotiation is more accurately described as price stabilization than price suppression. Why? Because price increases are not allowed before new negotiated prices are approved and announced. If prices are increased without authorization, the "Regulations for Suppressing Acts Against Price Control and Price Negotiation" may be applied for punishment.

From this, it can also be inferred that the Price Review Council has the ability to provide timely stabilization in the face of unreasonable price increases driven by speculation and manipulation. Because prices based on cost plus a reasonable profit are permitted by law and cannot be considered speculation or manipulation. The so-called speculation and manipulation must result in price increases beyond the legal cost and profit, which can be negotiated by the council at any time and strictly enforced by the competent authorities. Moreover, assisting in reporting violations is also one of the council's functions. If there are any acts of violating negotiated prices and increasing prices without authorization, the council itself has the power to report them. Therefore, the council is indeed responsible and empowered to deal with such illegal acts of speculation and manipulation.

However, price fluctuations have many causes, some due to speculation and manipulation, and others due to other factors. For example, surpluses and shortages in supply and demand, seasonal changes, tightness or looseness of credit, transportation bottlenecks, increases or decreases in taxes, labor unrest, harvest yields, fluctuations in production costs, and even fluctuations in currency value and foreign exchange rates, as well as political and military measures, can all affect prices, causing them to deviate from normal trends. Therefore, to achieve price stabilization, it is necessary to carefully study various aspects, seek solutions, and provide appropriate remedies for each. It is like treating a disease: the sources of the disease are different, and the prescriptions used cannot be the same. The meaning of "prescribing medicine according to the disease" or "prescribing the right medicine for the symptoms" lies in this.

The recent price increases have been quite intense. Whether this is due to speculation and manipulation or whether there are other reasons is a very complex issue and seems difficult to determine. Yesterday, the authorities conducted strict investigations, and items such as soap, candles, matches, silk fabrics, and cotton cloth have seen slight price decreases, indicating that the price increases for some goods do have artificial factors involved. However, the prices of most goods, such as rice, oil, and miscellaneous grains, continue to jump, or even are only offered at high prices but not sold, and do not become calm and return to normal due to the attention or persuasion of the authorities. This proves that the situation is not as simple as one might imagine.

Since the victory, production has shrunk, idle capital has been rampant, and coupled with transportation, power, raw materials, high interest rates, wages, heavy taxes, smuggling, and other reasons, the situation of industry and commerce has been deteriorating, resembling a combination of several ailments. This is an undeniable fact. Therefore, the treatment must also be comprehensive, with efforts focused on various aspects to achieve gradual progress. It is reported that the authorities are preparing to continue selling rice, and the household sugar program has also been decided to continue. For oil raw materials, 8,000 tons of soybeans have been secured and can be allocated for factory use, while exports have been prohibited. For industrial necessities, the authorities have also approved the supply of foreign exchange for continuous procurement. These measures are fundamental solutions for suppressing prices. We hope that this approach will be expanded more widely and effectively, promoting both price subsidies and production guidance, while also selling bonds to absorb idle capital, and then supplementing with price negotiation measures to crack down on all illegal speculative transactions. With such comprehensive measures, making progress on both fronts, it may be possible to achieve a considerable effect on price stabilization. If this is not done, and excessive emphasis is placed on price negotiation, it may be nothing more than wishful thinking.

### The Foreign Ministers' Conference Falls into Stalemate Again - The German-Polish Border is Difficult to Determine - Three Conflicting Views Cannot Be Reconciled

[United Press, Moscow, 10th] The Anglo-American proposal to revise the western border of Poland has become an absolute stalemate at today's Four Foreign Ministers' Conference. According to various indications, this stalemate will affect the entire German border issue. The future of the Ruhr industrial area, the Rhine, and the Saar has not been discussed by the four powers. However, the general view among Western countries is that if agreement cannot be reached on the eastern border of Germany, it is unlikely that any border will be resolved.

[Our Report] London, 10th Broadcast: According to a statement from the French representative, the French Foreign Minister Bidault will request the Foreign Ministers' Conference to immediately approve the economic merger of the Saar into France and to study France's proposal to create an independent status for the Ruhr and the Rhineland. As negotiations between the Western powers and the Soviet Union on the re-division of the German-Polish border have reached a stalemate, the re-raising of this issue by France is expected to plunge the entire German border issue into difficulties, creating serious political consequences.

[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 9th] The Four Foreign Ministers' Conference met today to discuss the German border issue and reached three different views, which are difficult to reconcile. U.S. Secretary of State General Marshall supports the views of British Foreign Secretary Bevin, while French Foreign Minister Bidault and Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov each have their own views. Secretary of State Marshall wanted today's Foreign Ministers' Conference to discuss the German-Polish border, but Foreign Minister Bidault took the opportunity to reiterate France's position on the border issue, which is that it is a comprehensive issue that cannot be resolved separately. Secretary of State Marshall and Foreign Secretary Bevin share a similar view on the economic perspective and believe that the border issue should be observed from an economic perspective in order to take into account the economic development interests of Germany, Poland, and other European countries, thereby contributing to the peace and security of Europe. The current border has unbalanced Germany and made Germany cede large areas of agricultural land, making it unable to supply food to the people of the whole country. Therefore, some measures should be taken to balance its industry and agriculture. The most important of these is that Poland should return some agricultural areas to Germany. As for whether Poland can fully utilize this land and contribute to its own country and other European countries, it is difficult to say. According to Foreign Secretary Bevin himself, Poland's border was too far east in 1919 and is now too far west. The method taken in France's view to balance German workers and agriculture is for Germany to obtain its western industrial area to compensate for the loss of its eastern agricultural area. As for the Saar and Ruhr areas, this cannot be confused with the territorial claims put forward by Belgium, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands. In addition, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov insisted on his original position, refusing to compromise with the opinions of Britain and France, and said that the German-Polish border had become a fait accompli and was recognized by the Allied powers at the Yalta and Potsdam conferences.

[United Press, Moscow, 9th] Britain and the United States proposed at the Foreign Ministers' Conference today to establish an international committee to formulate detailed rules for the German-Polish border, allowing Poland to retain administrative control over the industrial area of Silesia, but part of the industrial area currently occupied by Poland should be returned to Germany. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov opposed the proposal, saying that according to the Potsdam Agreement, the 40,000 square miles of land Poland took from Germany, including Silesia and the base, should all belong to Poland. French Foreign Minister Bidault said that the border issue needs to be studied further, but he did not state whether he supported or opposed the current border.

[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 9th] The Four Deputy Foreign Ministers' Conference met today to discuss the issue of which countries should be invited to participate in the future peace treaty with Germany. The four deputy foreign ministers still had very different opinions on inviting Albania to participate. France and the Soviet Union supported Albania's participation, but Britain and the United States expressed their dissent. U.S. Representative Murphy raised the issue of whether Latin American countries that participated in the war against the Axis powers should participate in the peace conference, saying that some of these countries had made significant contributions to the war against Japan, and that other countries had contributed even more by joining the war later. Soviet Representative Vyshinsky spoke to refute this, saying, "We are not discussing the Japanese issue here. I hope that when we discuss the Japanese issue, we can proceed more quickly than we are discussing the German issue."

### U.S. Republican Presidential Candidate Stassen Meets with Stalin - Candid Discussion of Economic Systems of Both Countries

[United Press, Moscow, 10th] U.S. Republican presidential candidate Stassen met with Premier Stalin for 80 minutes last night, with Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov also present. According to Stassen's statement to reporters: "We candidly discussed the economic systems of both countries. I have requested the Soviet side to provide a record of the conversation, and I may be able to comment in detail after receiving it. Premier Stalin spoke very cautiously and occasionally smoked." He also said that he had visited the Sverdlovsk wartime tank manufacturing heavy industrial plant in the Urals, which has now been converted to manufacturing well-drilling equipment. Stassen has just returned from a three-day tour of the Ural region. If the weather is clear today, he plans to fly to Kyiv.

### Wallace Advocates - U.S. Loans to the Soviet Union

Disapproves of U.S. Aid to Greece and Turkey

[Reuters, London, 9th] Former U.S. Secretary of Commerce Wallace told reporters here: In the next three months, the United States may formulate a foreign policy that could lead to war, and I will do my best to prevent this policy from being decided. He also said: Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union have not yet abandoned their policies of imperialism or expansion, but the strength used by Britain in this regard is not as great as that of the United States and the Soviet Union. Britain has set a deadline to withdraw from India and Burma, which is the right policy. Reporters then asked what connection there was between de Gaulle's recent political activities and President Truman's aid plan. Wallace said: He believes there is a close connection between the two. Wallace strongly advocated that the United States lend to the Soviet Union, but expressed regret at the Soviet Union's refusal to participate in international organizations such as the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization. Regarding U.S. aid to Greece and Turkey, he said that he has always opposed loans that do not have productive purposes, and he especially opposes political loans.

### Czech External Representative Hradil Arrives in Moscow

[Central News Agency, Moscow, Erri] Hradil, Director of the Treaty Department of the Czech Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and his assistant Fischer arrived here today. Gross, Director of the Information Department of the Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs, arrived here two weeks ago. The mission of their arrival is unclear, but they may stay here as informal observers of the Moscow Conference.

### U.S. Senators Criticize - Current Government Policies

Say It Should Not Fund Soviet Satellite States

[United Press, Washington, 9th] The U.S. Senate and House of Representatives are currently discussing foreign aid issues. Some Republican senators oppose the current government's contradictory policies, while other Republican senators continue to urge the expedited approval of the $400 million aid package for Greece and Turkey and the $350 million aid package for China and European countries. Republican Senator Butler said in the Senate: The United States is launching the world's largest bounty competition, providing funding to both sides of the competition, that is, aiding Greece and Turkey on one hand, while also providing loans to the Soviet satellite states on the other. Butler opposed the following three plans: (1) The State Department's request to allocate $25 million to settle accounts with the United States, including the final settlement of the Lend-Lease accounts; (2) The government's extension to give potatoes to "Stalin's main puppet, Yugoslav President Tito"; (3) Poland and the Czech Republic's applications to the International Bank for U.S. dollar loans. Republican Representative Taber, Chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, demanded an explanation as to why Truman could not stop export licenses to the Soviet-occupied areas, which would lead U.S. foreign policy in one direction. Taber said that this refers to the termination of the UNRRA plan for aid to Poland, Yugoslavia, Ukraine, and Belarus. On the House Foreign Affairs Committee, the majority of members demanded the swift approval of the $350 million aid plan for China, Italy, Greece, the Netherlands, Austria, and Poland, but three Republican opposition members adopted the same position as Taber, demanding that the funding for this plan be reduced to $200 million.

### Large-Scale Search for Fugitives in the Four Occupation Zones of Germany

[Agence France-Presse, Berlin, 10th] The police of the four countries – Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union – suddenly conducted a simultaneous search in their respective zones last night to arrest deserters, war criminals, and black market merchants. It is reported that this was first proposed by the Soviet side and then implemented after being decided by the four commanders-in-chief. It was kept strictly secret beforehand, with only ten people knowing about it. However, some Americans believe that this move is not in line with democratic principles and have expressed their opposition. According to well-informed sources, this is because the United States does not recognize some exiled people as Soviet citizens, so the Soviet side intends to arrest them. In addition to the Allied police, 5,000 German police also participated in the operation, going to brothels, gambling dens, and other places to search. The dividing lines of the occupation zones were all guarded by troops to prevent the police from crossing the border and causing trouble.

### Negotiations on Revising the Anglo-Soviet Treaty - Widely Divergent Opinions

[Agence France-Presse, London, 9th] Regarding the revision of the Anglo-Soviet alliance, it was recently reported that people close to the British government said that both Britain and the Soviet Union have put forward proposals for the alliance and have shown that their opinions are widely divergent. Therefore, this alliance may not be signed before British Foreign Secretary Bevin returns from Moscow. However, most of the work must be completed before Foreign Secretary Bevin leaves the Soviet Union and returns home. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov has already put forward a counter-proposal after receiving the draft proposed by Britain in accordance with the Franco-Soviet alliance of December 1944. Its wording is quite vague. The British draft was drafted with reference to the Anglo-French Dunkirk Treaty, and its preamble stipulates that both signatories believe that this new treaty will be of great benefit in resolving all outstanding issues between the two countries, but the draft proposed by the Soviet Union does not have this provision. In addition, the Soviet draft does not mention the San Francisco Charter, nor does it involve the Dunkirk Treaty. The Soviet Union has not expressed its willingness to see the countries responsible for the German issue conclude the same treaty. Even in the first article, the British draft stipulates that if Germany adopts an aggressive policy or takes measures to facilitate its aggression, the two signatories should immediately consult with other countries responsible for the German issue, and then take common measures. The Soviet draft does not mention prior consultation. But in any case, British people ultimately hope that Foreign Secretary Bevin can eliminate these differences with the Soviet Union in Moscow. After the preliminary work is completed, British Ambassador to the Soviet Union Sir Peterson will be able to complete this negotiation after Foreign Secretary Bevin returns to the country.

### Wartime Secrets

[Reuters, New York, 10th] President Roosevelt's book "Wartime Cooperation" was published in New York today. The book reveals that Roosevelt wrote to Pope Pius XII on September 3, 1941, stating, "I believe that the Soviet Union also has a dictatorship like Germany, but I feel that the danger of the Soviet dictatorship to the security of other countries is not as great as that of the German dictatorship." The book also reveals that the United States knew about Hitler's plan to attack the Soviet Union six months in advance and immediately notified Moscow. Former U.S. Special Envoy to the Vatican, Taylor, wrote in the introduction to the book: Because the Soviet Union denies religion, helping the Soviet Union is a problem for the church, and it is necessary for Washington and the Vatican to exchange opinions on this.

### High U.S. Prices - Cabinet Discusses Countermeasures

[United Press, Washington, 9th] The Cabinet held a special meeting today to discuss the problem of high prices. Knowles, Chairman of President Truman's Council of Economic Advisers, read a lengthy report at the cabinet meeting. Knowles reported to the President yesterday on the increase in prices and said that the issue was "serious." A White House spokesman announced today that the cabinet meeting did not decide what countermeasures to take, nor was it prepared to take any action.

### Rumors of U.S. Participation in Anglo-Indian Conference - Discussing Indian Defense Issues - Officials Neither Confirm nor Deny

[United Press, London, 9th] People close to the situation here recently said that the United States has also recently participated in the Anglo-Indian Army talks here to discuss Indian defense issues after the British army withdraws by June next year. This move can also be regarded as a U.S. anti-communist action. It is rumored that the main content of the talks is about what kind of assistance Britain and the United States need to provide after the British army withdraws in order to defend its northern "back door" and prevent the intrusion of communist forces. These talks are kept strictly secret, and the names of the participating U.S. military officers are also unknown. According to the Communist "Daily Worker," this matter was apparently initiated by the Anglo-American Joint Staff in Washington. It is learned that the talks ended a week ago when Brigadier General Cariappa, a senior Indian military officer, returned to New Delhi. It is expected that Cariappa will report the progress of the talks to General Auchinleck, Commander-in-Chief of the British Army in India, Governor-General Mountbatten, and Nehru after returning to India. According to private Indian sources, the number of U.S. State Department officials in New Delhi has recently tripled compared to the past few months, and the United States has actually begun building defenses in India during the war. Observers also said that U.S. troops have moved to northern India, the Assam-Burma Railway, and wartime temporary barracks. In addition, the United States announced last month that it had established diplomatic relations with India and granted a loan to the Kingdom of Nepal between northern India and Tibet.

[United Press, Washington, 9th] The impression obtained after an official investigation here is that London may be holding a three-way meeting to discuss India's future military policy, but it is only informal and private in nature. This news has not been officially confirmed, and Army Department officials have declined to comment. It is reported that the State Department has inquired the Army Department about this matter, but officials have not denied it either, leading everyone to believe that this news cannot be publicly discussed at present. A responsible party said: What do you think?

### U.S. State Department Denies Loan Plan to Korea
[Reuters, Washington, 9th] A State Department spokesperson stated: The U.S. government has not yet approved any aid plan for Korea. According to a telegram from Shanghai, President Truman has agreed to provide Korea with a loan of 600 million yuan after formally recognizing the Korean government.

### Philippine Embezzlement Case, Roxas Advocates Thorough Investigation
U.S. Military in the Philippines to Issue Statement
[Associated Press, Manila, 10th] The embezzlement of surplus materials has shocked the Philippines. President Roxas told the press today: "The Philippines will definitely conduct a thorough investigation into this matter immediately. No one believes that the committee appointed to handle surplus materials has engaged in any irregularities. Accusations of corruption against the committee are mostly from those who are isolated or have not obtained the privilege of purchasing surplus materials. If their motives are impure, they should be strictly investigated. According to the U.S. surplus materials agreement, we will obtain surplus materials worth $630 million. If the surplus materials actually transferred to the Philippine government are less than this amount, the terms of the agreement must be adjusted." At the same time, a spokesperson for the U.S. military headquarters in the Philippines stated that Commander Moya is currently studying a lengthy report on the theft of materials from U.S. Army bases and will issue a formal statement soon.

### France Suddenly Conscripts Youth to Cope with Unrest in Colonies

### Gandhi Says He Does Not Object to Jinnah as President of India
[French News Agency, New Delhi, 10th] Mahatma Gandhi declared today: I would not mind if Muslim leader Jinnah became the first president of the Republic of India, provided that the Indian government entrusts itself to the most suitable talents from both India and Islam. I do not understand the meaning of the so-called partition of India and Islam, but it is a fact that Muslims cannot establish a partition system by force or threat.

[French News Agency, New Delhi, 10th] All India Radio broadcast that Congress Party Chairman Kripalani will dine with Indian Governor-General Mountbatten today and is scheduled to discuss political issues with him next Monday.

It is rumored that Mountbatten is scheduled to convene a meeting of governors of various provinces within the next week.

### U.S. Seeks Opinions from Various Countries on the Issue of Japan's Overall Reparations
[Associated Press, Washington, 9th] After the State Department issued a temporary order to MacArthur to make a preliminary distribution of Japanese reparations, the United States is promoting the final resolution of the entire reparations issue. The U.S. delegation to the Far East Commission has urged other representatives to submit lists of reparations requests in order to develop a comprehensive plan and hopes to receive replies within two weeks. It is rumored that if the committee cannot reach an agreement, the United States may have to take unilateral action on the overall reparations issue. The Soviet Union's refusal to make a request is the main obstacle. The United Kingdom is taking a wait-and-see attitude, awaiting Soviet action.

[United Press, New York, 9th] Moscow's policy violates the Moscow Agreement. It also criticized the United States for allowing General MacArthur to govern Japan as if it were an American colony.

### Anti-Communist Wave Sweeps the United States
New York Airmail on April 1st
Special Correspondent, Xiang Jun
Although capitalist countries have a strong inherent anti-communist nature, the United States, for the sake of its democratic system which reveres freedom, has at least superficially refrained from discriminating against the Communist Party in the past. Generally, government officials and businessmen pride themselves on the excellence of the democratic system. Although the capitalist system seems outdated and backward to the "progressive" faction, they point out that everyone is well-off and self-sufficient, so why do people around the world want to come to this land and ask for assistance? In their complacency, they do not directly attack the Communist Party. However, the atmosphere this past month has been different. Especially since President Truman called on Congress on March 12 to appropriate funds to aid Greece and Turkey to resist the expansionist ambitions spreading across Europe, the rhetoric has been universally praised, hailed as the "Truman Doctrine," comparable to the Monroe Doctrine and President Roosevelt's famous Lend-Lease Act speech. According to last week's Gallup poll, Truman's prestige, which had once declined, has been greatly boosted by this speech, and the Communist Party in this free country has been shaded by misfortune as a result.

### Anti-Communism in the U.S. Becomes More Pronounced
The wave of resistance to the Communist Party already had some splashes in the past, such as the anti-communist movement in the C.I.O. labor union last autumn and anti-communist speeches by famous parliamentarians. However, there were few precedents for government advocacy and parliamentary action. Although President Truman's speech did not mention names, the United States' determination to adopt an uncompromising spirit to prevent the spread of international communism was unambiguous. Subsequently, Secretary of State Marshall voiced support in Moscow, and Undersecretary of State Acheson elaborated on the issue multiple times in congressional review meetings, making Washington's position clear to the world. Acheson said: Aiding Greece and Turkey to resist expansionism will not cause war; on the contrary, if Greece and Turkey are not aided and the flames are allowed to continue, that will be the spark for World War III. Therefore, some people asked at the time what would happen if China were also ruled by the Communist Party. Acheson replied emphatically that the United States would not look with favor upon that. This proves that the U.S.'s international diplomatic foundation is about to enter a decision stage and is not indulging in wistful dreams of the past. It has been moving in this direction for the past year, but now it is more obvious.

The second wave of attacks on the Communist Party was the White House's order on March 22 to investigate federal employees for loyalty to the country. Previously, the War Manpower Commission in the United States fired an employee in 1944 because he participated in a "communist front" organization and opposed U.S. aid to the Allies, but when the Soviet Union was attacked by Germany, he also advocated aid to the Soviet Union. After investigation, he was found to have engaged in disloyal behavior. After a lawsuit, the Supreme Court recently ruled in favor of the government, tacitly approving the government's principle of this action. Therefore, Truman's order already has strong support.

The order stipulates: (1) All current civil servants, except for Congress and the courts, must be investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to determine their loyalty to the country. (2) Any person deemed by the Attorney General to be a member of or sympathetic to the Fascist Communist Party or a group intending to subvert the government must be fired. This order will affect the ten departments and independent agencies of the federal government, totaling 2.2 million people. This is another measure taken by the government in domestic affairs to ensure that all government employees, big and small, who receive government salaries, cannot engage in rebellious acts or conspiracies to subvert the country.

At the same time, the Eightieth Congress, now controlled by the Republican Party, is working very hard. There was originally a Committee on Un-American Activities in Congress, which was established to deal with this type of "harm to the republic." Now, it is facing an even more pressing question: should the Communist Party simply be declared illegal and directly banned? The committee has already drafted a bill and began reviewing it the day before yesterday. Newspapers and radios are debating, and advertisements have been placed for lectures. The first shot was fired by Truman's Secretary of Labor, Schwellenbach, in a speech on the West Coast, advocating a legal ban on the Communist Party. Republican members Thomas, Congressman Rankin, and Hartley have all proposed anti-communist bills. In addition to the loan to aid Greece and Turkey, a debate on banning the activities of the Communist Party has arisen in Congress, which was already boisterous. In recent days, the Congressional Review Committee has heard reports from the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and testimony from the general secretary of the American Communist Party, as well as statements from third parties. The issue is moving towards its climax day by day. This event is likely to attract even more attention from the people of our country.

### U.S. Attitude Shifts
In all fairness, the average American is not afraid of communism itself and prefers to allow the Communist Party to exist in order to protect human rights and freedom. They know that Marx's predictions about capitalism have not come true, and in such a rich and prosperous country, not many people will fall for the Communist Party's tricks. Therefore, even though the Communist Party exists, it will never be successful. It is like having maggots in a clean environment that will not grow, so there is no need to worry. However, as time passes, this attitude seems to be changing. On the one hand, they see that the opinions of the Soviet Union and the Western democratic countries have been irreconcilable in the past year, and there seems to be a deep grievance that is difficult to resolve. At the same time, the Soviet Union is expanding its conquest on the shattered European continent. On the other hand, they are also afraid that the Communist Parties in various countries are, in fact, mostly lackeys of the Red International, plotting internal subversion and are not a nation-based political party that sincerely advocates democracy. They only know how to be loyal to the Soviet Union and aim to subvert the government and sell out their country. As a result, their antipathy deepens, and they cannot help but be alert to their own safety. According to last week's Gallup poll report, 52% of Americans now believe that the Soviet Union harbors the intention of conquering the world. On the 26th, FBI Director Hoover stated in Congress that the American Communist Party is a fifth column whose purpose is to subvert the government. They are loyal to the Soviet Union, not the United States. Hoover said that since President Truman's declaration of aid to Greece and Turkey, the American Communist Party has mobilized in many ways to oppose it, holding mass meetings or threatening Congress with letters and telegrams. He also said that the organization of the American Communist Party is even better than that of the Nazis. In the past few years, they have accepted instructions from the Paris Communist Party, which were relayed from Moscow. The Director also provided investigation figures, stating that the top communist in New York State has 30,000 people, followed by California with 8,553 people, then Illinois with 6,500, Ohio with 3,838, and Michigan with fewer at 2,135. In addition, there are many people who have not registered due to their positions. It should also be noted that although their numbers are not large, their penetration is particularly harmful. These words are as shocking as the testimony of Undersecretary of State Acheson, which caused Molotov to protest, that "the Soviet Union is expansionist," although the discovery was not very fresh in substance.

### Communist Party Tries to Incite Resistance
Under the protection of the Constitution, the American Communist Party will certainly not remain idle. A full-page advertisement has been published in the newspaper with the headline "When they say they want to ban the Communist Party, you'll be next!" The advertisement asserts that members of Congress intend to destroy human rights, which will inevitably make everyone feel insecure and force the government to move toward the path of fascism. It reminds the public to quickly send letters and telegrams to President Truman, the chairman of the Congressional Subcommittee, and all members of Congress, opposing legislation banning the Communist Party. At the same time, it published an open letter to Secretary of State Marshall, saying that the speech you gave in Moscow on the true meaning of democracy was very good and hoping that you would quickly designate your spokesperson to present his views on this issue to Congress. In addition, it organized mass meetings, saying that the American Communist Party is a democratic force that supports labor and promotes the progress of black people, and it absolutely opposes the unconstitutional and fascist practices orchestrated by capitalists behind the scenes. The General Secretary of the American Communist Party, Eugene Dennis, who is about forty years old, voluntarily went to Washington D.C. yesterday to testify before Congress. Unfortunately, the result was not very good. Although his words were reasonable, when asked his real name and date of birth, he changed his expression and refused to give a truthful answer, causing him to quarrel with fiercely anti-communist members of Congress such as Mr. Thomas on the spot. Coincidentally, FBI Director Hoover recited about ten of his aliases all at once. As a result, the subcommittee formally issued a subpoena, requiring Dennis to testify before the committee at a set time, temporarily ending the small storm.

### Anti-Communist Wave is Still Growing
The anti-communist wave in the United States is still growing, and there will likely be many more exciting performances in the congressional review meetings in the coming days. However, judging from various aspects, it is probably impossible to simply legislate to ban the Communist Party. First, the Constitution explicitly stipulates that the basic rights of the people cannot be violated. Even in wartime, the Supreme Court did not allow this precious doctrine to be slightly damaged for any reason, let alone in peacetime? Therefore, it seems that the Communist Party can rest easy knowing that the law protects its existence. Second, according to various sources, there is actually no determination in Congress to legislate to ban the Communist Party. Most people believe that even if the law does not cause problems, it will not help the matter. In particular, the Communist Party is prone to change. If you say you are banning the Communist Party today, they will immediately change their signboard tomorrow, or even drive it underground, making it even more difficult to deal with in the future. Third, although public opinion generally does not sympathize with the Communist Party's actions, in order to uphold the golden rule of democracy and freedom, most people do not advocate a hard ban. Newspaper letters have repeatedly emphasized the supreme principle of guaranteeing the Constitution. Even the chairman of the American Federation of Labor, Green, who has always spared no effort in attacking the Communist Party, told Congress that he does not advocate legislation to ban it in order to avoid infringing on basic principles. The Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation also holds this view. After describing many hateful and accusatory words against the Communist Party, he concluded: "Our most effective countermeasure is to ensure the implementation of an effective democratic system that guarantees our true freedom."

### Anglo-Albanian Corfu Channel Dispute Submitted to International Law
Albania Believes British Proposal is Unjustified
[Associated Press, Lake Success, 9th] The United Nations Security Council today adopted a British proposal to refer the British-Albanian minefield dispute to the International Court of Justice in The Hague, with a vote of eight to zero. The Soviet Union and Poland abstained, and the United Kingdom, as a party to the dispute, did not participate in the vote. Albania opposed the British proposal. Chairman Guo Taiqi believed that since Albania agreed to accept the resolutions of the Security Council, it must abide by the decisions of the Security Council and the International Court of Justice. Albania is not a member of the United Nations, but if it agrees to abide by the decisions of the International Court of Justice, it may appear in court. This is the first time that a dispute before the Security Council has been referred to the International Court of Justice.

[Reuters, Lake Success, New York, 9th] The Albanian representative told the United Nations Security Council today that the Albanian government refuses to submit the Albanian-British dispute over the Corfu Channel to the International Court of Justice for adjudication. Albania believes that the United Kingdom has no grounds and asks the Council to firmly reject the British request. Soviet representative Gromyko supported Albania and said that the Soviet Union also cannot agree to the International Court of Justice hearing the matter.

### First Price Evaluation Conference, High-Quality White Rice Limited to 140,000
Restore Sugar Rationing for Household Registration, Cotton Yarn at 3.5 Million Per Piece
Request Central Government to Allocate 14,000 Tons of Soybeans Monthly to Suppress Oil Prices
[Our Correspondent] The first meeting of the Shanghai Price Evaluation Conference was held yesterday morning in the conference room of the Social Affairs Bureau. Members present included Xuan Tiewu, Yu Shuping, Qian Naixin, Xu Jilun, Wu Yunxun, Shui Xiangyun, Cheng Cangbo, Xu Caicheng, Ouyang Lun, etc. Also present were Gu Bingyuan, Director of the Economic Administration Department of the Social Affairs Bureau, and representatives from various sub-groups. Chairman Wu Kaixian presided over the meeting and provided a detailed analysis of the causes of price fluctuations. Director Gu then reported on the price negotiation situation over the past year. Xuan Tiewu, Xu Qi, and others then expressed their opinions.

Subsequently, Director Wu met with reporters and provided a detailed analysis of rice, oil, sugar, and cloth, stating: (1) Rice: When President Song was in office, he agreed to allocate 200,000 tons of stored rice to Shanghai to suppress rice prices at any time. Later, a total of 100,000 tons of the rice arrived, and the Ministry of Food allocated 70,000 tons for rationing to public and education personnel. Because the Social Affairs Bureau has limited grain reserves and the market is flooded with floating capital, it dares not sell off easily. Now, it is requesting the Ministry of Food to allocate the full 200,000 tons of stored grain as planned and requesting the Central Government to prohibit rice exports and prevent purchases to suppress prices in production areas. The negotiated price of medium-ripe rice in this city has been adjusted from 121,000 to 130,000 based on the actual situation, and high-quality white rice has been adjusted from 120,000 to 140,000. (2) Oil: The price of soybean oil must be controlled from the price of soybeans. Currently, the price of soybeans has risen to 110,000 per unit. Based on the principle that three units of soybeans produce one unit of oil, and all processing fees are offset by soybean cake, then 331,000 per unit, which is 3,300 yuan per pound, is required. In fact, the manufacturing cost is 4,350 yuan per pound. The previous limited price was 2,500 yuan per pound, so all oil factories felt that they could not maintain it. The Central Government originally supplied this city with 8,000 tons of soybeans per month at a price of 50,000 per unit, but this number is not enough for this city's needs, so it is specifically requested to increase the allocation by 6,000 tons per month. Only in this way can the oil market be absolutely controlled and the price of 2,500 yuan per pound be maintained. (3) Sugar: Sugar merchants previously requested a 50% increase in sugar prices because the weather was warming and there would be more outlets. The Price Evaluation Conference believed that the sugar merchants were not manufacturers but intermediaries and that the reasons given were insufficient, so the request was rejected. Currently, the black market price of sugar is about 3,200 to 3,400 per pound. It has been decided to restore sugar rationing for household registration in April, with a price of about 2,000 per pound. (4) Cloth: The price of cloth must be controlled from the price of cotton. Currently, the market price of cotton is 1 million per unit. Based on the principle that three and a half units of cotton produce one piece of cloth, then excluding expenses, 3.5 million is required. The current limited price is 3.5 million. Unless the Central Government provides subsidies, merchants feel that they cannot maintain it. Therefore, the Central Government has been requested to accurately determine a price for cotton. In addition, the prices of fuel and flour will remain unchanged. Director Wu will submit the above decisions to the municipal government meeting this morning for filing.

### Sugar Rationing for Public and Education Personnel Begins Selling Yesterday
The distribution of sugar rations for public and education personnel in this city for March has been handled by the Shanghai South Goods Merchants Association, which has taken delivery from the Taiwan Sugar Corporation. A total of 1,100 packages of No. 1 cotton white sugar began to be distributed yesterday. All public and education personnel from various agencies can purchase the sugar at nearby participating stores by presenting their purchase certificates. All 36 participating stores have a sign indicating "Food Essence Rationing Point" and have sugar samples on display. The regulations stipulate that staff and police officers receive two pounds each, and police constables and workers receive one pound each, at a price of 2,000 yuan per pound.

### Council to Hold Meeting to Discuss Housing Lease Regulations
[Our Correspondent] The City Council, in order to study the draft Housing Lease Regulations formulated by the Legislative Yuan, has scheduled a meeting for 3:00 PM today to convene the Land Administration, Regulations, and Social Affairs Committees to discuss the matter and invite other councilors and officials from the Land Administration and Social Affairs Bureaus to attend and provide their opinions.

### Council Organizes Municipal Inspection Team
[Our Correspondent] The City Council believes that the needs of this city's society are endless, while the government's resources are limited. In order to promote public opinion and advance municipal affairs, it has organized a Municipal Inspection Team to conduct a comprehensive and in-depth inspection of various municipal departments and invite responsible officials and experts from various departments to participate and exchange ideas. Before the inspection is implemented, based on past observations, all matters that should be initiated and reformed are made into inspection points in order to grasp the key points. After the inspection results report is submitted to the council for review, the Municipal Government will be requested to adopt and implement the measures. The City Government has received the City Council's letter regarding this resolution and issued a notice to all subordinate bureaus yesterday.

### Disaster of the Sinking of the Fu Bo Warship, Prosecutors Investigate the Hai Min Vessel
Reportedly Summons Relevant Crew Members Today
Regarding the tragic sinking of the Fu Bo gunboat, the Navy Headquarters believes that the Hai Min vessel, which caused the accident, has a mutual rescue responsibility according to maritime law in the event of a collision between two ships. Because the vessel failed to provide rescue when the gunboat was in distress, causing the gunboat's naval personnel to tragically perish, the Navy Headquarters has requested the District Prosecutor's Office to investigate the captain of the Hai Min vessel, Dai Rulin, in accordance with Article 128 of maritime law and Article 370 of criminal law. The District Prosecutor's Office dispatched bailiffs to arrest Dai Rulin on the night before last at 11:00 PM and escorted him to the District Prosecutor's Office, where Prosecutor Cao Hong presided over the interrogation until he adjourned at 12:00 AM. Due to the seriousness of the case, the defendant Dai Rulin was detained in the District Court Detention Center that night. It is understood that during the interrogation, the defendant flatly denied failing to provide rescue. In order to conduct a thorough investigation, Prosecutor Cao Hong, accompanied by Clerk Chen Zhaiyan, Interpreter Xu Shaoyong, Staff Officer Cheng Ding from the Navy Headquarters, Military Judge Chen Shimao, and Engineer Yang Yuanchi from the Naval Shipyard, went to the Longhua Naval Shipyard at 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon. The Navy Headquarters provided a speedboat to approach the Hai Min vessel and inspect the damaged bow and stern sections of the vessel. They then boarded the ship, guided by the acting captain of the vessel, Yu Zhixiang, to investigate the bow, midships, bridge and other locations, and Engineer Yang explained the details and researched them carefully, and inspected the vessel's life-saving equipment. They left the ship and returned north at about 5:00 PM. The District Prosecutor's Office has scheduled a continued court investigation at 9:30 AM today and will summon relevant persons, including Chief Mate Wu Nianzu of the Hai Min vessel, on-duty crew member Wu Kan, helmsman Wu Fuqing, Liu Fenfa, lookout seaman Ma Fugen, and passengers Zheng Guiren, Sun Junhua, Jiang Jixin, and Luo Qianzun. The summonses were issued yesterday.

### Tongji University Continues Strike, Four Resolutions, Renewed Petition
[Our Correspondent] After earnest persuasion by the school authorities, the striking students of Tongji University originally planned to resume classes today. However, upon seeing the rectified letter from the involved soldiers and the distorted remarks made by the school board member to the Central News Agency as reported in yesterday's newspapers, they felt quite dissatisfied and decided to continue the strike. At 2:00 PM yesterday, they held a second representative meeting in the College of Engineering. In addition to representatives from various departments of the university, representatives from the affiliated middle school, senior vocational school, and nursing school also participated. The following resolutions were made immediately: (1) Demand that the responsible authorities apologize in major Shanghai newspapers. (2) Immediately detain, investigate, and punish the involved officers and soldiers. (3) Withdraw troops from the campus within a time limit. (4) Provide a public written guarantee that the same incident will not occur again in the future. According to student representatives, they have decided to petition the port headquarters again this morning. If there is no result, they will expand their actions. The Student Union will also hold a reception for reporters at the College of Arts at 191 North Sichuan Road at 2:00 PM this afternoon.

### Capital Refuses to Pay Difference, Social Affairs Bureau Transfers to Evaluation Committee for Handling, Wu Kaixian Says Labor Union Can File a Lawsuit
[Our Correspondent] In recent days, some capitalists have refused to pay the difference. Industries going to the Social Affairs Bureau to petition include mechanical sewing, carving woodware, umbrella manufacturing, mirror frame manufacturing, Western clothing, and women's Western clothing. The Labor Department of the Social Affairs Bureau has transferred the relevant cases to the Labor-Capital Evaluation Committee for handling. Director Wu Kaixian of the Social Affairs Bureau expressed his opinion on this matter, stating: "If capitalists have such illegal situations, the labor union can file a lawsuit with the court." Currently, the most disputes are caused by the issue of the difference for child labor. Anyone under the age of 16 is treated as a minor worker. However, the work efficiency of child labor in tobacco factories is mostly higher than that of adults, while the difference is less, so there are many disputes. However, according to labor law regulations, child labor is not based on work efficiency as the standard but on age, so it cannot be changed.

### New Finance Director Tian Yongqian Takes Office, Very Few Personnel Changes
[Our Correspondent] The handover ceremony between the old and new directors of the Municipal Finance Bureau was held in the bureau's conference room at 10:00 AM yesterday. A total of more than 50 heads of various management departments and sections attended. After the former director, Gu Chunfan, introduced the new director, Tian Yongqian, to the staff, he gave a farewell speech, expressing his gratitude for the cooperation of all colleagues in the past. Tian then delivered a speech, stating: "Although I have worked in finance in the past, Shanghai is an international city, and the environment is different. I deeply fear that due to my shallow knowledge, I will not be able to fulfill this position. Fortunately, Director Gu has already established a good foundation. In the future, I hope that my colleagues will provide more assistance and continue to follow the established rules." After he finished speaking, Geng Meizhang, the second section head of the Municipal Government Accounting Office, supervised the handing over of the seal, and the ceremony concluded. Gu left by car, and the staff bid him farewell. Reporters then asked the new director what changes there would be in the bureau's affairs and personnel. He replied: "This time, I have accepted the invitation of a friend to take charge of the finance staff, not to become an official. Therefore, except for the head of the cash management team, who was originally concurrently the head of the audit section, has resigned from the concurrent position and Wu Zhuang has been appointed to succeed him, and one seal has been commissioned, there are no other changes. In the future, due to the fact that the bureau's affairs have just begun, I will refrain from saying more."

### Catastrophe on Dapu Road, Truck Fire, Spreads and Causes Disaster, Nearly 200 Shanties Destroyed, 3,000 Homeless, Four Tragic Deaths, Many Burned
[Our Correspondent] At about 3:00 PM yesterday, a truck loaded with film reels suddenly caught fire at the entrance of Dabingyue at No. 62 Dapu Road in southern Shanghai, causing a major disaster that spread and destroyed about 170-180 nearby shanties and burned to death four residents, both adults and children. Dapu Road is located between Xiexu Road and Xujiahui Road. The area is densely packed with shanties, with hundreds of them, which are the residences of general laborers, rickshaw pullers, small shopkeepers, and workers. At about 3:00 PM yesterday, a truck from Huali Transportation Company (license plate number 36561) was driven by driver Li Ada (from Yancheng, 33 years old), carrying a large number of film reels in iron barrels, speeding south to north. When it arrived at the entrance of Dabing Store at No. 62 of the road, it suddenly noticed that the rear of the truck had caught fire. At that time, Li Ada urgently stopped the engine. Seeing the catastrophe, he and five workers, Lu Zhaozhong, Lin Ruifu (both with burned hands and backs), Gu Yunsheng (injured hands and feet), Wang Yunfu (injured right hand and head), and Wang Rujin (injured head), abandoned the car and fled. The fire in the car was strong, and flames were flying in an instant. In addition to the film reels and the car body being burned, the fire spread to nearby shanties, destroying as many as 170-180 of them. From Xiexu Road in the south to Xujiahui Road in the north, the area has been burned into a white land, and as many as 3,000 residents have been displaced.

### Six Dead and Injured at Shengli Restaurant
The most tragic losses were at the Shengli Restaurant. There were six deaths and injuries in the whole family. It is reported that Zhang Zhiqin (32 years old), Wang Zhichao (11 years old, Zhang’s nephew), Qiao Xin (52 years old), and Qiu Yizhang (43 years old) died in the fire. Zhang Zuoyinkun, his wife Zhang Tian, and an apprentice were also seriously burned and in critical condition. Chen Yutai grocery store and smoke paper shop, and a small tea house and Dabing shop were also completely destroyed. Huainan Elementary School and Public School have slight losses. At the same time, Lu Zongren, a petitioner from China Textile No. 6 Printing and Dyeing Factory at No. 80 Dapu Road, was burned in the head and hands and sent to the hospital for treatment by the factory. The factory was not affected, which was really fortunate. After the fire broke out, the Central, Xinkaihe, Taishan, Wuxing, and Nanshi fire brigades rushed to the scene, and the fire was extinguished at about 7:00 PM. After receiving the report, the Lugiawan Police Department, led by the deputy director Zhao Peijin, and Sun Siming, along with section chief Hao Jingyi, patrol officer Ni Jiafeng, and all the police and auxiliary police, arrived at the scene to suppress the situation.

### The Arsonist Driver Was Arrested
After the driver Li Ada and the workers fled, section chief Hao immediately ordered patrol officer Ni to find out that the truck with license plate number 36561 belonged to the Huali Transportation Company. He then led the police to the company at 21 Yuanchang Lane, Liling Road, Hongkou. He further found out that the car was actually jointly purchased by Wu Guangfu and Lu Lao San, who lived at 34 Qingyu Lane, East Changzhi Road, and was operated under the company's banner. He then turned to the address and found out that the driver lived at No. 4 Xijiazhai, Guangxing Wharf, Yangshupu. He rushed to the place and arrested Li. Li also confessed that the five workers were receiving treatment at a small hospital in Tilanqiao. He then went to the hospital and brought the five workers back to the bureau for interrogation. According to the confession, "The film reels were handed over by the Asia Customs Brokerage on Guangdong Road, Sichuan Road and were to be transported from the Kaiping Wharf on Rihui East Road to Bailinan Road in western Shanghai." As for the cause of the fire, the police are still investigating. However, there are many rumors at the scene of the fire, saying that someone got on the car and accidentally threw a cigarette butt onto the rosin-based film roll, causing the fire.

### Wuxi People's Daily Reports Destruction, Asks for Support from Local Colleagues
[Our Correspondent] The Wuxi People's Daily was destroyed by a group of students from a frontier school the day before yesterday because it published a news article about a "ticket supplement dispute." Yesterday, all newspapers in Wuxi jointly suspended publication for one day to show their protest. Sun Xiangfeng, the president of the People's Daily, held a reception at the Xinghualou Restaurant in this city yesterday afternoon to report the incident to local colleagues and to appeal to them to support the newspaper because news businesses and employees across the country have been repeatedly beaten and destroyed, and freedom of the press has been severely undermined, which is a matter of concern for the entire press. He also asked the authorities to thoroughly investigate and deal with the incident in order to seek effective protection in the future. President Sun also said: This news article was worded very carefully and did not offend the teachers and students of the frontier school. However, at about 4:00 PM, Ye Peizhang and another teacher from the school went to the newspaper office and demanded correction and apology in a rude manner. The newspaper asked them at the time where exactly in the article was untrue? Where must it be corrected? In addition to the fact that the school's students went to the Soviet Union for travel and were mistaken for returning to Wuxi from Shanghai, the rest could not be answered. The two then flicked their sleeves and left. Unexpectedly, in less than ten minutes, more than 100 students from the school, divided into two large trucks, carrying

New Medicines and Vaccines for Preventing Tuberculosis: “BCG” by Wang Mingqin

Recently, news and magazine articles about new drugs for treating tuberculosis have frequently appeared. However, when we mention the word "consumption" (tuberculosis), it still makes people feel as if they are facing a tiger, causing fear. The reason is that tuberculosis bacteria often invade your lungs unknowingly, gradually developing and spreading until they eventually rot away your lungs beyond repair. Nevertheless, humanity is intelligent, so decades ago, people began researching methods to combat tuberculosis, and as a result, "BCG" was discovered. However, for the past twenty years, we seem to have forgotten this weapon against pulmonary tuberculosis. Until recently, European and American countries have been diligently researching it again. Although its efficacy is not yet fully established, its contribution to the history of medicine is indelible. Many people, especially infants, have relied on its power to avoid being struck down by this "white plague."

Since the power of "BCG" is so astonishing, the cost is very low. In the United States, each dose costs less than ten cents. Its usage is also very simple, with few reactions after administration. However, its manufacturing is time-consuming, which is its only drawback.

The common practices of getting vaccinations, receiving serum injections, and variolation are medically known as immunization. "BCG" is similar to the smallpox vaccine. The smallpox vaccine involves inoculating smallpox bacteria into a cow. Gradually, the cow's skin develops pox scars. The fluid inside these scars is extracted, ground, and made into a glycerol suspension, which is the smallpox vaccine. Therefore, the main component of the smallpox vaccine is live smallpox bacteria. However, these bacteria are not the original ones; they have been "reincarnated" once, and their virulence has been weakened. So, when inoculated into humans, they do not cause danger, but their other power – the ability to produce resistance – remains. Thus, when genuine smallpox bacteria invade the human body later, the resistance produced by vaccination comes into play, saving people from danger. The principle of "BCG" is the same as vaccination, but its production method is somewhat different. It also uses tuberculosis bacteria (tubercle bacilli), but instead of inoculating them into cows, they are cultured in a culture medium (a glycerin preparation of ox bile). After several years, the virulence of the bacteria gradually weakens to the point where they no longer cause danger to humans, but their ability to induce immunity remains. This is "BCG."

Why is it called "BCG"? What is the extent of its effectiveness? You can understand by looking at the following history. In 1908, two French scientists, Albert Calmette and Camille Guerin, inoculated a very small amount of tubercle bacilli into cows. As a result, they discovered that the cows developed considerable immunity to tuberculosis. So, they continued their research. Thirteen years later, they finally developed a method of long-term cultivation to gradually reduce the virulence of the bacteria so that it could be used in humans. This is the so-called "Bacillus of Calmette and Guerin." Because the first three letters of its English name, Bacillus of Calmette and Guerin, are "BCG," it is called "BCG."

This new discovery shook the whole of Europe. It was greatly welcomed by various countries, such as France, Denmark, Sweden, and Norway. Infants whose mothers had pulmonary tuberculosis were given "BCG" orally within ten days of birth. The British Ministry of Health even decided to set up a laboratory to manufacture this vaccine. However, in the New World, "BCG" was not well-received. Because in 1930, an unfortunate incident occurred in Lubeck, Germany. Two hundred and fifty infants died within a few months after being inoculated with "BCG." Although later investigation revealed that the culture medium had been accidentally contaminated with highly virulent tubercle bacilli, Americans have avoided using this method ever since. This was partly because European scientists could not yet control its efficacy and partly because they feared another unfortunate incident. However, now the United States is also paying attention to this almost-forgotten weapon against tuberculosis.

After research by many American scientists, they came to a common conclusion. That is, "BCG" cannot be hailed as a miraculous drug. It cannot cure, nor can it be considered an absolute preventative. However, in environments where contact with tubercle bacilli is easy, "BCG" is indeed the only good preventative medicine. In addition, there are three interesting experiments. In 1935, Dr. Aronson at the University of Pennsylvania spent six years selecting more than three thousand non-tuberculous Indian children from four tuberculosis-prone areas in the western United States and twelve communities in southern Alaska. He divided them into two groups; 1550 were injected with "BCG," and 1457 were secretly given saline solution instead of "BCG." Both groups lived in the same dirty huts, with equal opportunities for contact with tubercle bacilli. If "BCG" had no preventative effect, then the number of Indian people infected with pulmonary tuberculosis in both groups should be equal. However, Dr. Aronson found that among those Indians who died from tuberculosis, those injected with saline solution accounted for twenty-eight people, while those injected with BCG accounted for only four. At the same time, Dr. Ferguson spent five years using female nurses in hospitals and sanatoriums as experimental subjects. The results showed that nurses who had not been injected with BCG had a four times greater chance of contracting pulmonary tuberculosis than those who had been injected with "BCG." In addition, Dr. Joseph Bado randomly divided children in a tuberculosis-prone poor area into two groups, and they all lived in the same environment. Years later, Dr. Bado found that among children who had been injected with "BCG," the number who died from tuberculosis was 18.7 per thousand, and the number who contracted tuberculosis was 1.35 per thousand. As for those who had not been injected, the death rate was 47.4 per thousand, and the infection rate was 237 per thousand. From the above experimental reports, the effectiveness of "BCG" can be understood.

Finally, concerning the use of "BCG," it can be divided into two types. Infants use the oral method, because infants' skin is delicate and not suitable for injection, and infants' mucous membranes are easily absorbed. Children and adults mostly use subcutaneous injection. It is said that the Pasteur Institute branch in this city has already issued this vaccine. In addition, it is said that the Sino-Western Sanatorium on Bubbling Well Road has also been using this vaccine for quite some time.

### Random Notes on Measles (Continued and Completed) by Xie Yunshou

(3) The room should not be too bright, because patients with conjunctivitis are afraid of light, and window curtains can be used to block strong light.

(4) Rest quietly in bed. This should be done not only when there is a fever, but also for two or three weeks after the fever subsides. It is forbidden to move around outdoors. The custom of "measles patients not going out for a month" is indeed insightful.

(5) If children have tuberculosis, more attention should be paid to their health after measles, for about three months.

(6) The mouth, eyes, nasal cavity, etc., should be kept clean, and washed or gargled with boric acid water to avoid various complications.

(7) Of course, easily digestible liquid foods should be chosen.

(8) If the fever does not subside after the rash is fully developed, or if there are any other changes, the doctor should be notified quickly for appropriate treatment. Delaying treatment is not advisable.

What is the most terrible thing about measles? It is a type of complication. Among the complications, the most common and dangerous is measles bronchitis, which leads to measles pneumonia. It mostly occurs in children under five years old, especially in young children with weak constitutions. The child's face suddenly turns pale, sometimes becoming cyanotic, with difficulty breathing, high fever, and restlessness. What people commonly refer to as "the measles not coming out or sinking inward" is mostly this situation. Measles combined with pneumonia often occurs when the measles rash is most vigorous. Sometimes, after measles has progressed smoothly and the fever has subsided, fever recurs, triggering pneumonia. The prognosis is mostly poor. Even if the pneumonia is treated properly, it will delay the recovery period of measles.

Secondly, is intestinal dysfunction, resulting in dysentery-like diarrhea, with increased bowel movements, and stools that are mucous and watery. Sometimes it even combines with true dysentery, leaving the child in a miserable state.

The third is nephritis, with reduced urination, facial edema, and protein in the urine, but not as much as during scarlet fever. The fourth is whooping cough. Measles combined with whooping cough makes the prognosis very poor. The fifth is latent tuberculosis, such as pulmonary tuberculosis, tuberculous lymphadenitis, etc., which are often delayed and enlarged due to measles. This is commonly called "sha lao," and can even lead to miliary tuberculosis, resulting in rapid death. The sixth is eye disease, such as conjunctivitis, blepharitis, commonly called "sha zi yan," which can even lead to ulcerative keratitis, resulting in blindness. The seventh is severe stomatitis, which can even combine with noma (i.e., cancrum oris), leading to sepsis and death. The eighth is pharyngitis, which sometimes turns into aphonia, and can even combine with true diphtheria. I have already written about many complications above, so I say that the measles itself is not terrible; what is terrible are the complications!

(3) The new drug Tridione is available in the United States, but not yet sold in Shanghai. (4) Spermatorrhea is not directly related to this disease. (5) Phimosis is also not related to this disease.

Answer to Yang Yongwei: You have a hernia (commonly known as a small intestine hernia) and rhinitis. Seek treatment at the Municipal Hospital, and you will recover in a short period of time.

Answer to Ye Sheng: You are suffering from pulmonary tuberculosis and neurasthenia. Since your condition has improved, you should naturally continue to rest and increase nutrition. If possible, you should also inject glucose, calcium, and vitamin B and C. (Above answered by Yang Shida)

### The Mystery of New Chinese Medicine (2) by Hong Guanzhi

(2) The Mysticism and Experience of Chinese Medicine

Before discussing the issue of scientificization, we must first analyze the "essence" of Chinese medicine. The theory of Chinese medicine is based on "mysticism" built on empty speculation. Yin and Yang, the Five Elements, the Five Movements, the Six Qi, Interior and Exterior, Ascending and Descending, Floating and Sinking, etc., are all starting points of Chinese medicine theory. However, these terms are products of "metaphysics" (although they cannot represent everything in metaphysics). Derived from this speculation is "mysticism." Looking at all Chinese medicine books throughout history, whether physiology, symptoms, medicinal properties, or therapeutic effects, they are all explained using this terminology. Therefore, the theory of Chinese medicine is "mysticism," which is undeniable. Mr. Lu, in his article "Experience and Metaphysics," made a grand statement, saying:

"What is called metaphysics? How can Chinese medicine be metaphysical? Flipping through the dictionary, metaphysics is the study of Taoism, which of course has nothing to do with Chinese medicine. Another meaning is Meta-physiscs, also known as metaphysics, which leads to the realm of philosophy... I don't understand metaphysics, which is the first philosophy... I don't understand, what does Chinese medicine have to do with this..."

Mr. Lu's words are aimed at Mr. Fan Shouyuan's statement in the People's Medical Journal that Chinese medicine is metaphysics. Yes, Chinese medicine is not philosophical, and the object of medicine is "people," who are tangible and qualitative beings. Naturally, it is not "metaphysical," and naturally, it cannot and should not be speculated or studied using "metaphysical methods." However, Mr. Lu has clearly overlooked the other aspect of the interpretation of "metaphysics." It is acceptable to say that Chinese medicine is not "the entirety of metaphysics," but the other interpretation of "metaphysics" is the teachings of Taoism, which cannot be said to have nothing to do with Chinese medicine. Chinese medicine theory is deeply influenced by Taoism. This is a fact, and terms such as Yin and Yang, the Five Elements, generation and destruction, etc., are the basis of Chinese medicine's basic theory. Take the Yellow Emperor's Inner Classic, for example, most of it has the breath of Taoism. Even now, the theories often used in Chinese medicine prescriptions are incarnations of this kind of "mysticism." Can you still say that this kind of Taoist "mysticism" has nothing to do with Chinese medicine? Please do not forget your ancestors, this "mysticism" is the ancestor of Chinese medicine! I think Mr. Fan's statement that "Chinese medicine is metaphysics" is already a compliment to Chinese medicine (in fact, the theory of Chinese medicine is not enough to represent the entirety of metaphysics), which led Mr. Lu to take the opportunity to elaborate and talk about the metaphysics of philosophy. Since medicine is the "science" of "people," there is no "medicine" allowed in the realm of metaphysics. In fact, the theory of Chinese medicine is a vague and empty speculation, so this kind of "mysticism" is neither science nor philosophy, and does not even qualify as "metaphysics." What I said above can also serve as a partial answer to "What is Chinese medicine"!

Secondly, what Chinese medicine relies on is the so-called "experience." In the past, the Chinese medicine community always said that Chinese medicine was philosophical or scientific, but now there is a realization that this view is incorrect. Moreover, clinical practice in Chinese medicine can originally put aside the theory of "mysticism," so what does it rely on to diagnose and treat? It can only be said to use "experience," and greatly exaggerate the achievements of "experience" to contend with science. To say that the essence of Chinese medicine originally comes from experience, experience is valuable, and especially to say that Chinese medicine is "experimental" is a view that has only become popular in recent decades, because attaching to philosophy, science, or art does not work. However, everyone should not overlook the essence of "experience." We have never found in Chinese medicine literature the statement that Chinese medicine is a product of "experience." If there is any, there are only dozens of prescription books that sometimes label something as "experimental good prescriptions" or "experimental prescriptions." However, these "experimental prescriptions" were collected casually by predecessors, and in fact, they are not all effective. I'm afraid that the word "experience" is rarely found in other medical classics! However, relying solely on a few book titles cannot be used as an argument that Chinese medicine is "experimental." Everyone knows that the so-called saying of an experimental good prescription is only saying that it is a prescription that has been tried by someone, and there is nothing to be surprised or overjoyed about. In fact, it is well known that "experimental prescriptions" are not very effective, and I really don't understand what glory there is in saying that Chinese medicine is "experimental." However, to put it another way, the "experience" they speak of does not refer to the experience of "experimental good prescriptions," but is associated with the "empiricism" of philosophy, and believes that everything in Chinese medicine is "experimental" and does not only refer to prescriptions. Therefore, it is indeed valuable, and in principle, experience should be valuable. One can know its meaning at a glance, so what is the need for explanation? However, the "experience" we usually talk about, for example, saying that someone is experienced in handling affairs, whether in social aspects or in technical aspects, all belongs to personal "experience" and is not knowledge, nor does it contain the meaning of absolute reliability or "effectiveness." As for the term "experience" in philosophy, it is translated from Western languages and has two interpretations: The previous empiricism referred to the subjective empiricism of "personally experiencing the matter and directly recognizing the object through human senses." However, the new philosophical theory now states, "Knowledge obtained by observing phenomena in objective reality, or by artificially setting conditions and experimenting on the phenomena to be studied in the laboratory, is experience." In other words, the result of experimentation is true experience. We know that the Western word Experiment is also translated as "experience." Mr. Yu Yunxiu said that experience is subjective, and Mr. Lu came to refute him, saying that there is also "experience" based on observation and experimentation. Indeed, Mr. Yu did not mention another interpretation of experience in his article on experience, which is his shortcoming and also a temporary oversight in his writing. We cannot say that he does not know the other meaning of the original Western word for experience. Since Mr. Yu's argument is based on subjective experience, he said that experience is not valuable, and those who rely solely on experience for technology are mediocre and unworthy of mention. However, not mentioning experience does not mean that it can be abandoned, which can be said to be a fair argument. (To be continued)

Separation in Spring and Autumn by Hungarian F. Molnar, translated by Yan Dachun

In a secluded path in the park, a man and a woman are wandering.

She: Now it can end. The time to separate has come. We have nothing more to do. Please kiss my hand, let's part as friends.

He: As you say.

She: Bester! We don't need anything except for each of us to keep those happiest, most intimate memories. We met, loved, kissed briefly, and now, we are both tired.

He: You are right. (He kisses her hand)

She: I will take the path on the right to leave. You wait a little while, and leave by the path on the left. Now that we are saying goodbye forever, it would be too much if my husband were to see us leaving together.

He: Goodbye! (Neither of them moves)

She: Why aren't you leaving?

He: First, I have something to ask you.

She: What?

He: Do you remember? The first time I met you, you were in Hohen Tatras. You were there for the winter with some girlfriends. Your husband wasn't with you, so I didn't meet him then.

She: I remember that was how it was.

He: You must recall that we immediately fell for each other. Later, we continued our intimacy in Patra Bester, where I still didn't meet your husband.

She: No.

He: But one day you brought me a photo, a photo of a handsome man. You said, "I brought you a photo of my husband. I know you must want to know what he looks like." I carefully examined the photo, and the man in it was as handsome as Delacroix, as elegant as Edward VII. His hair was curly, his eyebrows formed a beautiful semicircle, his eyes were sincere and upright, and he even had a mouth like a Greek god. I didn't tell you, but that night I didn't eat a thing.

She: I guessed as much.

He: And I couldn't sleep well. At that time, I was in love with you, so how could I be willing to humiliate myself in comparison? So, I eagerly examined my own appearance in the mirror. I knew that I was neither beautiful nor ugly, just an ordinary face. The kind of face you can see on any adjutant. Seeing this face, I was very troubled, very angry. I was determined to transform it into something good-looking by any means.

She: I noticed that.

He: In those sleepless nights, I often asked myself, since you have such a handsome husband, how could you still be interested in me? I comforted myself, "Maybe her husband is a fool." So, I made a further analysis, admitting that my intelligence didn't exceed the average person, and the man in the photo even showed a hint of intelligence. I simply couldn't understand how you could fall in love with me. I envied, envied the man in the photo, so I gradually entered the realm of fierce competition with the photo.

She: I knew you would.

He: I had the best tailors make clothes, and the best hairdressers curl my hair. I was madly jealous every second. I carefully paid attention to every detail of my appearance, striving to reach the point of beauty. Sometimes, you told me that you were going to a dance with your husband, and the thought of him in evening dress, how dashing he would be, made me furious.

She: I expected you would.

He: Whenever you were free, I always demanded that you be with me. Do you remember? Once, you told me that your husband had gone to London on business and would be back in two weeks. I simply didn't let you out of my sight for a moment.

She: Indeed, he did go to London.

He: When you reported to me that he had returned, I asked you to let me meet him when you had the chance, but you refused. I just wanted to meet him while he was there, but you refused. And so, it happened.

She: What?

He: Now I can tell you the truth. One afternoon, you were at my apartment, and a note fell out of your purse. After you left, I picked it up and looked at it. It was written to your mother, saying: Your husband and you have reserved a box at the opera house tomorrow night. When passing by her apartment tomorrow night, take her with you to see the show. You were going to send the note to your mother, but inadvertently dropped it at my house.

She: Really? Did I lose it at your house?

He: Really. The next night, naturally, I also went to the opera house to see the show. I saw you—you, your mother, and your husband—all sitting in the box.

She: You went too?

He: Is that all you want to say?

She: What else do you expect me to say? Don't put on airs. Let me continue. That night at the opera house, I discovered—I dare not say you deceived me—a slight error. Your beauty was about fifty to fifty-five years old, unbelievably ugly, hunchbacked, with disheveled hair. Forgive me for being honest, he really was indescribably ugly.

She: Ah... Ah...

He: You won't deny that he is your husband.

She: I won't deny it.

He: To be sure, I even inquired with friends who knew him.

She: He is my husband.

He: All right, then why did you play this comedy with me? Who exactly is that handsome young man in the photo you gave me?

She: I don't know. I bought that photo in London for a few shillings. I guess he might be some English nobleman.

He: What?

She: Answer that question yourself. This was my trick, a successful little trick. When you started competing with the photo, you increased your value by fifty percent. You indescribably improved yourself. That photo turned you into a handsome, elegant, and intelligent man. So, I loved you very much. It was a joy for me to improve your character.

He: Truly clever. I'm willing for you to do that. This is truly typical female ingenuity. But you must know, you were too careless.

She: How so?

He: You see, because of a carelessness, unintentionally dropping a note from your purse, you ruined a flawless marriage created by lies. The day I saw your husband—your real husband—I knew you were lying to me, and the excitement that I had put into making myself lovable for you was completely lost. I no longer needed to pay attention to those things. I praised myself, your husband was inferior to me. Therefore, I gradually neglected my appearance. My jealousy also diminished. My self-love began to cool down. As a result, the love was destroyed. If you hadn't dropped that note, I would definitely still be in love with you today.

She: (Softly) So, do you believe that a woman like me would unintentionally drop a note at your house?

He: What does that mean?

She: A woman who deceives her husband is extremely careful with notes. If I had been so careless, my husband would have found out about my affair long ago.

He: You mean you deliberately dropped that note?

She: Of course.

He: (Angrily) Why?

She: Please answer that question yourself too. I intentionally wanted you to see my husband, so that you would slowly cool down, until you became completely indifferent. Because I have always hated pretense. When I was tired of you, I dropped that note. So, your interest in me disappeared, and our intimacy could have a natural, peaceful, and friendly ending.

He: You wanted to end it, entirely for...

She: I had already decided to give that photo of the handsome English youth to another similar man. Goodbye, friend. Don't be angry. Some people's hearts should be manipulated like this: holding a photo and a note at the same time. Just as Maupassant said in "The Human Heart." Goodbye!

He gazes thoughtfully as she takes the path on the right and disappears around the bend.

### Landscape by Derain

André Derain (1880-1954) is one of the three great masters of modern French painting. Since Cézanne's death, he and Picasso have been engaged in Cubism. To this day, his painting style has changed several times. Whether landscapes, figures, or still lifes, his compositions are exceptionally tight, his colors are infinitely varied, and his brushstrokes are simple and profound, with a masterly style. This work is a sketch for a stage set painted for an opera house in Morocco. It is different from his usual works. If there were no signature, it would be almost impossible to recognize it. (Lion)

### In Memory of President Yu Youren's 70th Birthday: The Origin of the Construction of the Minzhi Auditorium

Next year is the 70th birthday of Yu Youren, President of the Control Yuan. Comrades in Beijing initially discussed building the Youren Library in Xi'an for him. But Yu Youren objected, so they are separately planning to build the Minzhi Auditorium to show their admiration. The following explores its origins and supplements. (Reporter)

(Origin)

"Plowing and herding rivers and mountains, I wish to repay the nation with red blood; Crossing the river as a refugee, I write history of struggle; This year I accidentally meet Labor Day, Making firecrackers, an orphan with white hair."

"In the year of recognition of surrender, I suffered a hundred sorrows; The Zhongshan lineage cut off Ryukyu; The League arises to fight for all mankind, Not only singing and calling for Asia."

The above two poems were written by Mr. Yu Youren on his 67th birthday in Chongqing. They are also Mr. Yu's autobiography. From this we know that Mr. Yu had the ambition of plowing and herding rivers and mountains from his childhood. He also worked as a firecracker worker, representing the sound of the Chinese nation in its most pious or happiest moments. Even now, he does not only sing and call for Asia. Mr. Yu's achievements and writings are the most glorious page in the history of the Chinese nation. Mr. Yu's advocacy of standard cursive script bears a major mission for the construction of the new country. Mr. Yu is one who lives for art. Although Mr. Yu's hair is white, his spirit will always stand in front of us. Young people who see Mr. Yu become more passionate; old people who see Mr. Yu regain their youth; the sick and the weak who see Mr. Yu increase their courage to fight. Mr. Yu's health is not only not like an old man, but even surpasses that of a strong man. This symbolizes the ancient and great Chinese nation living forever – next year is Mr. Yu's 70th birthday. Mr. Yu recently sent a letter to a friend in Shaanxi saying: "Recently, I have devoted little effort to local cultural undertakings, and I want to establish a Jingguo Library in my old age." Establishing the Jingguo Library is Mr. Yu's concern for local culture, and how should we strive in our careers to repay the love and commemoration of this great man of the times? We want to build a great Youren Library in Xi'an, Shaanxi, and establish two branch libraries in Hanbei and Hannan. That is, to wish Mr. Yu longevity with Mr. Yu's heart of saving the world! And to complete our plan with the heart of fighting for all mankind. Respectfully request the powerful figures of the present era and the social elite to give us their strong assistance! Respectfully Yours.

(Supplement)

Mr. Yu heard about the above proposal and stopped it immediately, and told them that "The government will build a national library in Xi'an, which is large in scale. I am deeply grateful for your kindness, but I hope you will not engage in this duplicate undertaking at a time when the country is in great difficulty." The colleagues returned and agreed that Mr. Yu's intentions should not be violated, but we should express ourselves even more. It was unanimously agreed that Mr. Yu founded the Minzhi School in Xiguan, Sanyuan in the eighth year of the Republic of China. Since then, all his financial resources have been used for the school's facilities. Therefore, Mr. Yu has no permanent property in Shaanxi, and every time he returns, he uses the school as his home. To date, more than 5,000 people have graduated from primary and secondary schools, and they are either dedicated to education or serving society, and they can all abide by Mr. Yu's revolutionary spirit and struggle hard. Mr. Yu once planned to build a large auditorium for the school. After several years of planning, the bricks and wood were prepared, but it was interrupted by the War of Resistance. Since the turmoil, the old materials have been lost. Mr. Yu has always been concerned. Colleagues believe that the Minzhi School is a memorial site for Mr. Yu's leadership of the revolution in the Northwest, and will always be the spiritual fortress of revolutionary consciousness in the Northwest. Mr. Yu has supported it personally and has never requested assistance from the country. However, the construction of an auditorium has been delayed until now. Although Mr. Yu did not say anything, those who respect and love Mr. Yu, if they do not know it, it is fine, but if they know it and do not promote its completion, it is not only difficult for them to feel at ease, but also their unavoidable duty. Therefore, it was agreed to change the previous proposal to build the Youren Library to the Minzhi Auditorium. We hereby record this at the end of the proposal, and we hope for your public approval.

### Three Days of Qinhuai Poems by Chen Baohua

The Xuanwu Lake is clear and full of energy,
The Zhubiao boats are gentle and passionate;
Lying down, watching the red sleeves play lightly,
As if soaring in the sky.

Beside the southern bank of the Taicheng Terrace, calling back the soul,
Everywhere the cock crows, recognizing the Six Dynasties;
Today I come after the fires of war,
Leaning on the building, idly enjoying the peace flute.

Strolling in the suburban hills, the white sun sets,
Pearls and shadows compete in beauty;
The bridge inscription and oath are still there,
Watching the plum blossoms in one tree.

The great cause of a thousand years is as long as the sky,
Looking up to the supreme only for the public good;
Standing quietly on the steps of the mausoleum,
The mountains are full of flowers and trees in the gentle breeze.

A piece of coolness sweeps the leaves from the building,
Today's people do not worry with the ancients;
Outside Hanxi Gate, the rough road,
How many times have I seen the chariot to Mochou?

The willows by the embankment are green and new,
Three days of Qinhuai, a spring scene;
Asking the oriole if it understands,
Who is the person standing in the wind?

### Night Talk by Gu Liu

When the dense night fills the small house, fills the courtyard, fills the whole world...

Flowers of lamplight, one by one, bloom piece by piece.

Moving tired, aching legs, the traveler, for a speck of lamplight flashing at the end of the road, has great joy...

Not only those who light the way, but everyone loves lamplight: the white-haired old mother loves to turn the spinning wheel under an oil lamp; the children love the hand shadows projected on the white wall by the lamplight, or listen to their sister telling one beautiful fairy tale after another under the lamplight; the students love to recite their lessons before the lamp; young men and women love to keep watch over the lamplight, writing lines of passion with excited hearts...

Those who are illuminated by sunlight, those who are illuminated by fireflies, those who open a hole in the wall to borrow the neighbor's lamplight, how ardent and profound must their unrequited love for the lamp be!

Ah! Lamp! Why do you waste your blood in beautiful rooms, and why are you so stingy towards low, small earthen houses?

I understand, facing the silent lamplight serving in the darkness, I seem to hear the answer: The first person to invent the lamp was not biased! The lamp is not biased!...

### An Inch of Mountain, an Inch of Blood 313 by Ye Jingfeng

"So, why not invite them to join our organization?" Tsurumi believes that his organization is most suitable for the needs of this turbulent situation; as long as they are talented, he wants to win them over. Has the He Party not tried to persuade them?"

"They don't agree?" Tsurumi asked anxiously.

"No, because they don't want to join any organization. They have a fixed plan, which is implemented in three steps: First, to promote the success of the first unit of the new village; second, to divide the trained people into many small groups, and build many new village units in poor rural areas; third, to develop to the border areas?...

"What if the Japanese don't let them develop?"

"…?" Zheng Yan did not understand the meaning of Tsurumi's words.

"I mean, if this large-scale landing takes place, China will inevitably be covered in corpses and blood will flow like rivers, so what new villages

### U.S. Communist Party Secretary-General Refuses to Attend House Hearing

May Be Charged with Contempt of Congress

[United Press, Washington, 9th] U.S. Communist Party Secretary-General Dennis today refused to attend the House Un-American Activities Committee, submitting only a formal statement, in which he argued that the committee was not a "legitimate congressional committee" and therefore should not issue subpoenas. The Un-American Activities Committee considers this an act of contempt of Congress and resolved in a meeting today to ask the Justice Department to investigate the possibility of prosecuting Dennis for "willful contempt". If this charge is upheld, Dennis will face a maximum sentence of two years in prison and a fine of $10,000.
