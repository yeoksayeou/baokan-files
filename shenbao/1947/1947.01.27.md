### The Outpost of the South China Sea - The Xisha Islands

— From Our Newspaper's Archives

France is once again coveting the Xisha Islands, which stand at our country's southern end. The Xisha Islands are originally our country's territory, so of course we cannot allow others to lay their hands on them. On July 23rd of last year, Philippine Foreign Minister Quirino declared that the islands were located near the west of Palawan Island and intended to incorporate them into the Philippines, which once caused a dispute between our country and the Philippines. The Executive Yuan immediately ordered the Guangdong Provincial Government to take over the islands, and notified the Taiwan Provincial Government to assist them. On January 6th of this year, Peng Xuepei, Minister of Propaganda, announced that the Chinese government had recovered the Xisha Islands from Japanese occupation. Unexpectedly, the next day, the French Foreign Ministry declared that it considered the islands to belong to Vietnam. Since 1933, France had forcibly occupied the Spratly Islands until 1939 when they were occupied by Japan. In fact, the Spratly Islands are part of the Xisha Islands. Now they are adopting the same old trick of forcibly seizing territory, which is unwise to covet these Xisha Islands.

The Xisha Islands are located about 150 nautical miles southeast of Hainan Island, between 15 degrees 46 minutes and 17 degrees 5 minutes north latitude, and 110 degrees 14 minutes and 112 degrees 45 minutes east longitude, exactly between Vietnam and the Philippines. There are more than 20 islands of varying sizes, all formed by coral reefs. The largest island covers tens of square miles, while the smallest island is less than one-tenth of a square mile. This group of coral reefs scattered in the sea rises and falls with the tide, appearing and disappearing from time to time. In navigation, this is considered a dangerous area, so in 1908, our customs suggested building a lighthouse here. In 1930, someone also proposed at the International Meteorological Conference that the Chinese government establish a meteorological station in the Xisha Islands to facilitate maritime navigation.

The Xisha Islands have significant value in military terms. When Japan attempted to occupy the Xisha Islands in 1938, Japan published in the 326th East Asian Intelligence (April 25, 1939) that "especially for our naval authorities, if France, which already has fleet bases in Saigon and Guangzhou Bay, were to possess this flight base and submarine anchorage, the result would be a new situation in the naval power of the great powers in the South China Sea. From the perspective of national defense, this matter is naturally very important." From this, it can be seen that the matter is not minor.

Do not underestimate this group of small islands isolated overseas that float and sink with the tide. They are also a major source of economic benefit. The geology of the islands consists of sand and guano. The phosphate ore formed by fossilized guano is a famous product of the islands. The Japanese Phosphate Mining Company once set up a bureau here for mining, which ended in the 18th year of the Republic due to the impact of the global economic depression. The distribution of guano is richest on Lin Island, occupying an area of 1,291,600 square meters, with reserves of approximately 32,900 cubic meters, totaling 250,000 tons. There are also many aquatic products in the shallow seas surrounding the islands, such as sea cucumbers, clams, cuttlefish, coconut crabs, coral, hawksbill turtles, seaweed, kelp, sponges, etc. Many people from Hainan Island go fishing there, twice a year, leaving in early spring and returning in early summer, and leaving in late autumn and returning in late winter. Sea turtles are mostly caught in the spring, and clams are caught in both autumn and winter. Unfortunately, transportation is inconvenient, and there is no way to dry them, so production is not high.

Hai Guo Wen Jian Lu says: "Qiyangzhou must be passed by all those who travel to Nanyang. To its northeast are the Changsha and Shitang reefs, and ships should proceed with caution." The so-called Qiyangzhou is the Xisha Islands. It can be seen that in the late Ming and early Qing dynasties, our country already had records of the Xisha Islands. But in the Han Dynasty, General Li Fubo had already been there. The attached map of the Sino-French Treaty of Tianjin in 1858 further specified that the Xisha Islands should be included in our country's territory. Our oceanographer published the article "Data on the Time Required for the Building of Coral Reefs," explaining that a large number of "Yongle Tongbao" copper coins were found five feet below the coral reefs in the Xisha Islands. According to Ma's estimation, it takes 100 years for one foot of coral reef to form, so our country has occupied the coral islands for 500 years. This is a good proof.

However, our country has not paid much attention to overseas operations in the past. Even the discovery of these islands, according to speculation, was not by officials of the imperial court, but by fishermen on the coast. But our government has never indicated that it would give up. In the late Qing Dynasty, Wu Jingrong was sent to investigate and plan for development. The following year, Naval Admiral Li Zhun also led troops to garrison the island, raising the county flag and firing cannons, confirming that it was Chinese territory. This was fifteen years before the French occupied the Spratly Islands. Since France intended to occupy the Spratly Islands in 1932, our country has always declared that the Xisha Islands are part of our territory, and the French occupation of the Spratly Islands in 1933 and the occupation of the Xisha Islands in 1938 have not been recognized, and protests have been lodged with the French government. Why is France still using the old tricks of imperialism after today's victory?

Since the Xisha Islands are our country's territory, after the victory, of course they should still be under our country's control without any doubt. We should, of course, argue on the basis of reason about this French desire, but we must also go a step further and engage in positive construction, building houses, repairing ports, and opening up shipping lanes. It can serve as our country's outpost in Nanyang in terms of national defense, and also generate considerable economic benefits. Do not neglect its value because it is desolate, so as to avoid the occurrence of similar incidents again.

Following this, the government and the Youth Party held a meeting, the first to discuss the technical aspects of government reorganization. Simultaneously, Lei Zhen and representatives from the Youth Party and the Democratic Socialist Party are also discussing the technical details of government reorganization in Shanghai. This matter is proceeding rapidly in both Nanjing and Shanghai concurrently, suggesting that the detailed rules for government reorganization are likely to be discussed and completed by the scheduled date of February 1st. It is rumored that the key points of today's meeting included the allocation of 50 new seats in the Legislative Yuan, 44 additional seats in the National Political Council, and the appointment of a number of new members to the Constitutional Implementation Promotion Committee. The Youth Party and the Democratic Socialist Party are demanding one-third of these seats, and the government is considering this request.

[Agence France-Presse, Nanjing Dispatch, 26th] Local newspapers report that the government has accepted the proposals of the Youth Party and the Democratic Socialist Party to increase the number of Legislative Yuan members by 50, with two-thirds of these seats being allocated to the two parties. Furthermore, the next meeting of the Legislative Yuan is expected to be held at the end of February, at which time the following will be discussed: (1) the election law for the President and Vice President, (2) the election law for the Control Yuan members.

Mr. Lei's trip to Shanghai is still aimed at exchanging views with various parties on government reorganization so that he can report back to the central authorities upon his return to Nanjing. As for the rumors of him carrying a concrete plan for government reorganization, it is still too early to say.

[Our Report] When this reporter inquired with Zuo Shunsheng about the government reorganization matter, Mr. Zuo was unwilling to express his opinion.

### Central Training Corps Personnel Management Training Class Opens; Chairman Chiang Kai-shek Attends and Delivers Instructions, Earnestly Encouraging Members to Work Hard and Endure Hardships

[Central News Agency, Nanjing Dispatch, 26th] The Central Training Corps' Personnel Management Training Class for party, government, and military personnel has trained over three thousand graduates in its eight sessions since its establishment. The ninth session began classes on the 20th. The opening ceremony was held at the Central Training Corps Auditorium in Xiaolingwei at 10:00 AM on the 26th, with over fifty senior officers, including Dean Dai Chuanxian, and 304 trainees in attendance. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek attended the corps amidst heavy snowfall to deliver instructions, expressing his deep hope that all faculty and students will diligently study personnel administration techniques and establish a personnel system. Finally, he earnestly exhorted the students to work hard and endure hardships so that the personnel organization can become the driving force for building a personnel system, and then politics can be put on the right track. His words were sincere, and all listeners were excited. The ceremony concluded at 11:00 AM. The Chairman's instructions are as follows:

Our country's politics have always emphasized the use of talent. The ancients said that governance lies in people. At that time, this was specifically referring to governance by people. However, laws alone cannot implement themselves. Even in today's era of the rule of law, the implementation and application of any laws and systems completely depend on people. How to ensure that affairs are entrusted to the right people, how to enable people to fully use their talents, and how to improve people's character and develop their abilities all fall within the scope of personnel administration. In all undertakings, if personnel are not sound and properly coordinated, then all resources, time, finance, land, and materials will be wasted. Therefore, the promotion of general administration and the development of various construction projects must first depend on whether personnel management can be sound. Our country's personnel system has not been established for long, and its effectiveness has not yet been fully demonstrated. Lax work, low administrative efficiency, incomplete assessment and supervision, and unfair rewards and punishments are still common today. It is undeniable that personnel management should be actively strengthened to exert its function in order to establish an official system and achieve the effect of selecting the virtuous and capable. In recent years, the government has repeatedly emphasized this, established personnel organizations to take charge of the promotion, and held personnel management training classes, which have gone through eight sessions, with approximately 3,000 graduates. The purpose is to cultivate a large and sound core group of personnel cadres, distribute them to personnel organizations at all levels, put personnel on the right track, and promote political progress. I hope that all comrades will be mindful of the importance of their duties, study diligently, and strive to serve the country. While in class, you must examine your knowledge, review gains and losses, and improve the existing personnel system; after leaving class, you must be steadfast and conscientious in your duties. Within any organization, if one person is not properly appointed or unfairly dismissed, then the personnel manager should regard it as his own great shame, so that the old habits of perfunctory superficiality can be eliminated, and the atmosphere of seeking truth from facts and being accurate and effective can be cultivated, which will benefit the future of national construction.

### Heavy Snow Followed by Bitter Winds in Zhengzhou Affects Plugging Project; Breach Destroyed by Floodwaters Some Days Ago Has Been Repaired

[Central News Agency, Zhengzhou Dispatch, 26th] Following days of heavy snow, bitter winds in Zhengzhou have made it difficult to carry out the plugging project at the Huayuankou breach according to procedure. The wooden piles of the temporary bridge at the breach were washed away in five rows some days ago due to excessive water levels, but they have now been secured with wire. One thousand rolls of wire mesh for the riprap have recently been shipped from Shanghai. American advisor Mr. Todd returned here from Shanghai on the afternoon of the 24th. The plugging bureau plans to convene a meeting in the next few days to discuss the plugging project.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 26th] Regarding the Yellow River issue negotiated between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party in Shanghai, UNRRA is mediating. It is reported that both sides have made some concessions, with the government willing to make mutual concessions on the timing of water release, and the Communist Party willing to do so on plugging the breach. Currently, due to the winter season, the water is low and the river is dry, so no serious disaster is expected at present. However, the plugging project is urgent and cannot be delayed. Therefore, water release is inevitable. If a satisfactory agreement cannot be reached in the short term, the spring flood will cause serious disasters from both plugging the breach and releasing water.

[Our Jinan Dispatch, 26th] The Yellow River water reached Luokou at 5:00 PM on the 26th and Chuanjiazhuang at 7:00 PM, with a depth of 7 cm and a width of over 50 meters. According to river workers, there will not be a major surge in the near future.

### Xiong Shihui Talks About Impressions of Jiangxi Politics

Building a New Jiangxi is Not Difficult

[Our Nanchang Dispatch, 26th] Xiong Shihui told reporters his impressions of Jiangxi politics. He believes that Jiangxi is an area with abundant resources and rich agricultural products, which is sufficient to be the capital for building a new Jiangxi. Mr. Xiong also said: "Now that the great war is over and the destruction has passed, it is the special time for construction. However, during my return to Jiangxi this time, I saw barrenness everywhere in places like Nanxun, and the people looked emaciated. This situation fills me with grief. Today, the Jiangxi government should focus on agriculture, industry, and transportation as urgent priorities. It already has a new five-year construction plan, and I hope that the party, government, military groups, and the people will all work together for this great cause and not use their limited strength to fight and compete with each other, thereby canceling it out." Regarding construction funds, Jiangxi has abundant mineral resources, such as coal mines and the KVA project currently underway. If one is good at using and developing them, it is not difficult. Given the current economic situation of the central government, it has little power to assist local undertakings. We must strive for self-reliance and strive for foreign investment and the assistance of overseas Chinese capital. As long as we can guarantee the safety of foreign capital, it will not be difficult to absorb foreign assistance. Mr. Xiong also discussed the recent situation of industrial and mining enterprises in Northeast China, saying: "Although the industrial and mining enterprises in various places have been damaged by the Communist army and transported by the Soviet Union, the foundation still exists and is sufficient for new talents to learn. If anyone is willing to go to Northeast China for internships in the future, I am willing to help them so that they can return to the province after completing their studies, which can solve a part of the problem of technical talents." Mr. Xiong also emphasized that in future governance, one should give to the people and not take from them again to alleviate the suffering of the people, and one should also assist the development of private enterprises in various ways to stabilize society and help promote Jiangxi's five-year construction plan. Mr. Xiong is scheduled to return to his ancestral home in Anyi on the 28th to sweep the tombs.

### Coal Shortage in Northeast China Remains, Transportation Semi-Paralyzed; Communist-Controlled Locomotives Use Firewood Instead of Coal

[Central News Agency, Changchun Dispatch, 26th] The climate in Northeast China has been unusually cold in the past ten days, with daily temperatures averaging below -30 degrees Celsius, and the coal shortage remains, causing railway transportation in Northeast China to be in a semi-frozen state.

As for the railway locomotives in the Communist-controlled areas of Northeast China, most use firewood instead of coal, and can only travel 20 to 30 li per hour. There are no heating pipes in the cars, and passengers are like sitting in a cold palace.

### Editorial: Listen to the People's Voices!

Since the new peace talk proposal put forward by the government was resolutely rejected by the CCP, the glimmer of hope in the eyes of us ordinary people has also vanished. At the same time, due to the persistent prejudices of the Democratic League and the hesitant inaction of other political parties, the reorganization of the government cannot be realized for the time being. Looking again at southern Shandong and northern Jiangsu, the Communist army's offensive is becoming more and more fierce. The Communist army in the Northeast is also sharpening its swords and preparing to try its strength. All of this is more than enough to prove that the CCP has absolutely no intention of abandoning its armed separatist regime. It still wants to use war to promote the collapse of the domestic economy and achieve its ambition to seize power. Therefore, the flames of war in the country not only have no possibility of being extinguished, but the current military conflicts are even more at risk of escalating into a full-scale war. However, today's China is a country that has been weak for a hundred years. After eight years of arduous resistance against Japan, it is already exhausted and urgently needs to recuperate and restore its national vitality. How can it endure the catastrophe of internal strife again? Therefore, the current domestic situation not only makes the people of the whole country feel deeply distressed, but is also a matter of concern to friendly countries.

The Shanghai Municipal Council, in view of the danger of national affairs, first telegraphed the country, advising both parties to immediately stop their posts, resume peace talks, and reorganize the government, so as to actively carry out preparations for the implementation of constitutionalism. The 173 trade associations in Shanghai also responded to the Municipal Council the day before yesterday, telegraphing the people of the whole country to call for peace. Yesterday, Wang Xiaolai and other giants from all walks of society and industry and commerce in Shanghai issued a declaration, calling on both parties to immediately cease fighting on the spot. These are all calls for peace from the people of the country. Internationally, Marshal Ma has returned to Washington to take up the post of Secretary of State. He is currently consulting with President Truman and the leaders of the Democratic and Republican parties so as to adopt a bipartisan policy towards China. Even the United Kingdom, which has no time to take care of itself, has expressed great concern about the current situation in China. The remarks made by Labor Party member of the Upper House, Lin Binxun, advocating intervention in China's internal affairs, although they are a wrong view of the Chinese political situation by Congressman Lindsay, can also reflect how British people are concerned about Chinese politics. Therefore, from the domestic public opinion, we see the international opinion. It proves that Chinese and foreign people all hope that China will immediately stop the war, resume peace talks, and reorganize the government, so as to embark on the road of peaceful reunification, democracy, and national construction as soon as possible.

Since the government completed the constitutional drafting work at the National Assembly and closed successfully, it has been in contact with all parties, trying to resume peace talks and reorganize the government simultaneously, in order to make the country resolve conflicts into friendship as soon as possible. It not only accepted the opinions of the Youth Party and the Democratic Socialist Party, but also expressed considerable concessions to the two demands insisted upon by the CCP, and drafted a new plan for resuming peace talks, and wanted to send General Zhang Zhizhong to Yan'an for negotiations, but unexpectedly it was resolutely rejected by the CCP, completely closing the door to peace talks that had been opened. This fact is very clear in the eyes of us ordinary people. We know that the government is not only very sincere about resuming peace talks this time, but also has great determination. As for why the peace talks cannot be resumed this time, the CCP must be responsible. Because in the minds of us ordinary people, our views on national affairs are very simple. What we hope for is peaceful reunification, democracy, and national construction. What we demand is of course an immediate ceasefire and resumption of peace talks. Regardless of how reasonable the two conditions put forward by the CCP are, we still feel that making demands before resuming peace talks is simply a manifestation of no sincerity. "Without sincerity, there is nothing." Even if peace talks without sincerity are reluctantly resumed, they will be of no benefit to what we ordinary people hope for and demand. The CCP has always boasted of democracy, saying that any measures are based on public opinion. But why can't the CCP listen to the appeals from our ordinary people's conscience?

As for why we ordinary people are so urgently calling for peace? A declaration issued by Wang Xiaolai and others said, "The people of the whole country are about to be unable to survive. Due to the war, tens of thousands of compatriots continue to be displaced. Due to the war, transportation is blocked, currency is constantly inflated, people are unemployed, and industry and commerce are bankrupt. Therefore, we cannot but painfully issue a call of conscience, demanding an end to the war and demanding a restoration of peace." In the eyes of the CCP, these painful words may even be what the CCP is seeking but cannot obtain. When Marshal Ma was leaving China, he issued a statement, frankly pointing out that the CCP's conspiracy was to promote the collapse of the domestic economy through war, so as to achieve its goal of seizing power. But we want to tell the CCP frankly that this "bitter trick" is absolutely impossible. May I ask, what is the use of the CCP even if it seizes power after killing all 450 million people in the country? Therefore, we want to advise the CCP not to put the interests of the party above the interests of the country and the nation! Even if it wants to achieve a certain goal, it cannot use any means. To be honest, the CCP's achievements today were not created by its military force, but by the support of a portion of the people. If the CCP disregards the lives and deaths of the people and remains obsessed, it will be tantamount to cutting itself off from the people of the country. A political party that has broken away from the people cannot stand its ground, let alone have a bright future. Therefore, we want to advise the CCP to take a broader view, calm down, and listen to the voices of the people of the whole country. What is it that they hope for and what is it that they demand?

As for the Democratic League, we have read the full text of the political report of the Second Plenary Session of the Democratic League, and we agree entirely with the Democratic League's views: "The country must first have peace, and then the country can have unity and reunification; the country must first have unity and reunification, and then it can implement constitutionalism and realize democracy." Not only do we express our complete agreement in principle, but we also believe that this is especially appropriate at this time and should strive for its realization. Unfortunately, the actual behavior of the Democratic League is contrary to its views. The most urgent demand of the people of the whole country at the moment is to immediately cease fighting on the spot and quickly resume peace talks. Isn't this a demand that the country should have peace first? However, in this resumption of peace talks, the Democratic League obstinately adhered to its prejudices and failed to fulfill its responsibilities as a third-party mediator. Instead, it deliberately interpreted the CCP's actions, which violated public opinion. It is really incomprehensible. Moreover, the Democratic League has also adopted a lukewarm and uncooperative attitude towards the reorganization of the government, making it impossible to break the current domestic deadlock. The Democratic League claims to be committed to the spirit of democracy and, according to its interpretation, the so-called spirit of democracy is first acceptance, second mutual concession, and third compromise. But why does the Democratic League insist on its prejudices and refuse to change? Even in terms of supporting the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, we must tell the Democratic League honestly that the government is the one that truly implements the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, while the CCP is only using it as a guise. Therefore, since the Democratic League stands in the position of a third party, it should maintain an impartial attitude. In national affairs, it should distinguish between right and wrong, black and white, and distinguish between right and wrong. It should not have any prejudices. We acknowledge that the Democratic League is an independent and autonomous political group, so we still hope that the Democratic League can act in accordance with its views and seek the welfare of the country and the people. The greatest welfare of the country and the people at present is to immediately stop the war and resume peace. The Democratic League should work with compatriots across the country towards this goal and use the power of national opinion to promote the realization of peaceful reunification and democracy.

In short, the current domestic situation is really too dangerous. The root of all misfortunes lies in the war. If we allow it to spread, not only will the people be unable to survive, but the country will also be in danger of being destroyed by internal strife. Therefore, we have to come out and say to the CCP with tears in our eyes, hoping that the CCP will be moved by the conscience of the people of the whole country and be able to wake up completely, immediately give up its attempt to separate by force, and make the country resolve conflicts into friendship. At the same time, we have to shout loudly and appeal to the Democratic League to abandon its prejudices and change its methods in order to realize domestic peace, unity, and democracy.

The procedures require an application from a prison official, which is submitted to the Ministry of Justice for approval before it can be implemented. There is no need to implement this provision in the prisons of this province at present.

[This newspaper's Suzhou dispatch, 26th] The Ministry of Judicial Administration believes that the confiscation of the property of traitors is doubtful in various provinces, cities, and counties. After the Judicial Yuan's unified interpretation of the laws and regulations, a telegram was sent to the Jiangsu High Court yesterday to inform them that the property mentioned in Article 8 of the Regulations on Punishing Traitors refers to the property exclusively belonging to the traitor, and does not include the property of his brothers. If a traitor has several brothers and their property has not been divided, then the sealing and confiscation of the property should be limited to what belongs to the traitor, but the necessary living expenses for his family should still be retained.

### Zhuji-Jinhua Section of Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Scheduled to Open in March

[This newspaper's Hangzhou dispatch, 6th] This newspaper's reporter met with Hou Jiayuan, Director of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Bureau, yesterday. He said that the purpose of this inspection of Zhuji was to urge the engineering office to quickly nail the tracks in the Jinhua section, and it is planned to open it to traffic in March. The Executive Yuan allocated 450,000 sleepers, which are only enough for 30 kilometers, while the Zhuji-Jinhua section is 108 kilometers long, so it is still hoped that the Executive Yuan will assist. In terms of bridges, there is no problem with the contractors. As for the 65-pound rails laid between Hangzhou and Zhuji, it is planned to request the Executive Yuan to allocate 100 kilometers of 90-pound standard steel rails to replace them in order to ensure the safety of train operation.

### Jinshan County Government Borrowing Money for the New Year

[This newspaper's Jinshan dispatch] By the end of the lunar year, the county government owed various agencies as much as 100 million yuan. The central government's purchase of grain and the allocated funds were very difficult, and various tax revenues were light. Government teachers, police personnel, and groups were urging the payments urgently. The county government was empty and unable to cope. The county government convened a joint meeting of the party, government, military, and state to decide to temporarily divert 20 million yuan of reverse rent to solve the immediate needs. The shortfall will be borrowed from the Chamber of Commerce and repaid as soon as the provincial grain funds are allocated.

### Selling Grain to Fund Expenses, But No Buyers

Civil Servants Complaining Constantly

However, the treasury is empty and cannot be paid. After five county political meetings, it was decided to allow the sale of 3,000 stones of rice from the county-level grain to meet the urgent needs. It was publicly auctioned on the 17th, but grain merchants did not bid due to the lack of a large amount of cash. Civil servants in general are complaining constantly.

### Former Nantong County Magistrate's Major Corruption Case Transferred to Wudi Prosecutor's Office for Investigation

[This newspaper's Suzhou dispatch, 26th] Yang Fang, the former magistrate of Nantong County, abused his power during his term of office, colluding with the main personnel of the county to commit corruption and protect traitors, extorting huge sums of money. The entire people of the county presented accusations to the Jiangsu Provincial Government for both corruption and dereliction of duty. After sending senior officials to Nantong for a secret investigation, Chairman Wang of the Provincial Government immediately ordered Yang to be removed from battle and escorted to the province for investigation. Yang's evidence of corruption was transferred to the Jiangsu Provincial Prosecutor's Office on the 26th and sent to the Wudi Prosecutor's Office for investigation.

[This newspaper's Zhenjiang dispatch, 26th] It is learned that Yang Fang, the protagonist of the major corruption case in Nantong, was escorted to the Suzhou Higher Court by the director of the Provincial Police Department, Chuan Zhaoren, a few days ago.

### Two "Tigers" of Fuli, One of Whom Was Captured

[This newspaper's Suxian dispatch] Wang Shiyunhui, a native of Jiagou District in our county, served as the head of the self-defense regiment of the Fuli Special Zone (directly under the puppet Huaihai Provincial Government) during the enemy and puppet period. His nephew Wang Fulun served as the battalion commander of the regiment and the leader of the plainclothes team of the enemy's Komatsu unit. They colluded with each other and acted as lackeys of the enemy. Countless families of our anti-Japanese personnel and civilians were victimized. Everyone was indignant. They were known as the two tigers of Fuli. After the victory, Wang Yunhui fled without a trace. Wang Fulun used a false name to enter the county training center for training in an attempt to escape. However, he was eventually detected by the victims Zhang Bingqian, Zhou Maocai, Ji Huairong, Wei Yongming, and Ji Shouming and reported to the judicial office. He was arrested on the 18th. After investigation, it was confirmed and sent to the Bengbu First Branch of the High Court for legal proceedings.

### Ningbo is Planning to Build the Zhongzheng Bridge, Spanning the Yong River, A Massive Project

[This newspaper's Ningbo dispatch] The Xinjiang Bridge in our port is the only way for traffic between the north and south of the two rivers. Once the tide is rapid, ships passing under the bridge often collide and break their cables. Moreover, the cost of repairing the bridge is quite large every year. It is said that it is not easy to point out. The former county magistrate Chen Lin once initiated the construction of steel and cement imitating the Ling Bridge, but it was suspended due to the anti-Japanese war. It is a pity for those who heard about it. It is now known that the local celebrities Jin Tingsun, Zhou Dalie, and Jin believe that this bridge is related to the traffic of the Yong River, especially to the prosperity of the market, and it must be rebuilt. He discussed with local gentry, merchants, and heads of various agencies, and everyone agreed. He also estimated the source of funds. In addition to sending a letter to the Relief Administration to allocate steel and labor accounts, he also requested the Ministry of Communications to allow the Shanghai-Ningbo merchant ships and highway buses to collect an additional construction donation of 10% in order to complete it in two years, and the bridge was named Zhongzheng Bridge to commemorate the Chairman. The preparatory meeting will be convened at the beginning of the New Year to discuss the implementation.

### Witty Tale of Unhappy Couples Becoming a Good Match Through Wife Swapping

He married Tong Xi, Miss Ji, three years ago, but the couple's feelings were not good after the marriage. Miss Ji left home to work as a servant in the city. Gu Mingsheng, a fellow villager, is a businessman in the city. Although he was engaged to Miss Ling in his hometown, it was the order of his parents. Gu returned to his hometown in November to get married, but the couple had disagreements and had not slept in the same bed until now, and Miss Ling felt very lonely after the marriage, only complaining about her fate. Miss Ji once employed Gu Mingsheng in Xingxi Township, and the two were deeply in love. Recently, due to discord with her husband, her relationship with Gu became deeper and deeper. Gu also admired Miss Ji. Someone came up with a clever idea, that is, to marry Zhang's Miss Ji to Gu, and Gu's Miss Ling to Zhang, in order to make both parties happy.

### The Beiping American Soldier Rape of Female Student Case: The Final Act of Public Trial - A Detailed Account from Debate to Sentencing

[Report from our Beiping correspondent, dated the 24th] The American soldier assault case opened for debate on the 21st. After the prosecutor announced the key evidence proving Pearson's guilt, the defense, based on seemingly plausible evidence they had found, tried to argue that the incident was "consensual rape." However, they were ultimately refuted by the prosecutor and presented no new evidence. The court session began at 10:00 AM on the 21st, with a break after one hour and fifteen minutes. It resumed at 1:00 PM, concluding after only thirty-five minutes of rebuttal by the prosecutor. Most of those in the audience were the same faces, except that He Siyuan was replaced by Zhang Bojin. Ni Zheng'ao, a counselor from the Ministry of Judicial Administration, and E Sen, the Dean of the Law School of Soochow University, also arrived yesterday and attended the hearing today. This was the most important day, and everyone paid close attention. The judges on the bench also appeared somewhat tense today.

Supplementary Evidence Presented: Before the debate began, the victim, Shen Chong, made a special appearance to present the deep red cotton robe she wore on the night of the incident, which she had previously omitted. She pointed out that several tears at the bottom were not there on that day. The shorts and coat she had submitted earlier had also been washed on the 13th. After about ten minutes, the debate began. The prosecutor first asked the defendant if he wished to make a statement. The defendant's lawyer answered on his behalf, "No." The court announced that after the prosecutor stated the basis for the defendant's crime, the defendant could only make one defense. Otherwise, new evidence had to be presented for a re-debate.

No Consent: The prosecutor explained that, based on the results of questioning witnesses over the past three days, it was confirmed that Shen Chong did not consent to illegal sexual intercourse with the American soldier. Seven Chinese witnesses testified that they saw Pearson pressing down on Shen Chong multiple times on the Jiantan Parade Ground. Medical reports from both Chinese and foreign doctors also confirmed multiple injuries caused by Pearson's rape. Shen Chong had indeed struggled and cried for help under the violence of the two American soldiers. Therefore, it could be judged that (1) Pearson intentionally raped; the third charge of indecent assault could not be established; the fourth and fifth charges could be merged with the second and first charges; (2) Pearson was identified in court as the main perpetrator of the incident that night; (3) Both Chinese and American doctors proved that Pearson's penis had penetrated the victim's vagina;

Indeed Struggled: (4) The victim did indeed struggle under violence. This was witnessed by five Chinese soldiers who were turned away by an American soldier, and the fact that Chinese soldiers with weapons were also resisted proves that Shen Chong's resistance could not have been effective.

Defense: At this point, the defendant's lawyer requested a ten-minute break, after which he announced his prepared defense. He said that the defendant and Shen Chong engaged in sexual intercourse in an area with over a hundred pedestrians, yet Shen did not call out. Seven Chinese soldiers watched, yet Shen did not call out. The sexual act lasted three hours, but there were no injuries to the buttocks. This proves that Shen did not resist. Shen claimed her neck was strangled, but there were no injuries to the neck. The bruises on her legs were only discovered eleven days after the initial examination, lacking concrete reasons. In several of Shen's responses, she used words like "I don't know" and "I'm not sure," which are also questionable. Furthermore, she did not report the rape to the American military police on duty. The case was only reported as a rape case the next day by the Sino-American Liaison Office via telephone, possibly a fabricated plan by Shen Chong's brother-in-law, Yang, etc. "Therefore, it can be proved that Shen consented, and the rape charge cannot be established." At this point, the court announced a lunch break.

Rebuttal: At 1:00 PM, the prosecutor rebutted: (1) The claim that Shen did not call out was false. The testifying Chinese soldiers heard it three times. Strangling the neck does not necessarily cause injury, and Shen's life was in danger at any moment. (2) Witnesses Liu Zhiping, Zhao Ming, etc., all reported it as a rape case. Lieutenant General O'Dowd, on duty, also heard the word "rape" and admitted that he might have misheard it from the word "rape." (3) The three-hour stay was forced by Pearson. (4) There were only two sexual acts in three hours, which was not a long time, and Pearson was also drunk, so it is possible that there were few injuries. (5) Saying that Shen not taking off her gloves meant consent is better interpreted as lack of consent. (6) Male rapists do not necessarily injure their penis. After the prosecutor finished his rebuttal and the court asked the defense if there was any other evidence to present, the court announced an adjournment.

Sentencing: On the morning of the Lunar New Year, the American military court announced the establishment of Pearson's rape charge. The number of people in the audience did not decrease due to the holiday. Upon seeing each other, they exchanged New Year greetings and shook hands to celebrate the victory. After the court session began at 10:00 AM, Lieutenant Young, as usual, continued the previous day's record. Then, the prosecutor stood up and announced the "five charges in the indictment," among which the first charge of rape was established, the second and fourth charges were established, and the third and fifth charges were included in the previous two. He also presented a telegram from Howard, the commander of the First Marine Division stationed in Tianjin, ordering their dismissal. He then handed the original text to the defendant's lawyer, who took it with trembling hands, looked it over with his assistant, and submitted it to the court before temporarily announcing a recess. The judges retired to the courtroom's adjacent waiting room and invited the prosecutor inside for a discussion. After a short time, they returned to the courtroom, and the presiding judge formally announced that "the first charge of rape against the defendant, William Pearson, is established."

Pearson's Expression: Although Pearson's face did not show excessive anxiety, he finally showed unprecedented panic upon hearing the announcement and accepted the verdict as the judge walked down. The court announced that the sentencing portion would have to wait for review and approval. Furthermore, according to law, the case would no longer be publicly tried and could be handled according to law. At 10:35 AM, the public trial portion of the American soldier assault case, which had attracted worldwide attention, was completed.

Hu Shi Breaks the Silence: After the American military court announced Pearson's guilt for rape, Hu Shi broke his silence after several days of attending the hearing. He said, "I said earlier that I believed the American military court would be just, and now my words have been proven." President Hu, like others, expressed satisfaction with this announcement. The prosecutor also said to Ji Yuan, the prosecutor from our local court who was in the audience, that our military court was perhaps too troublesome and trivial. Ji replied very carefully and appropriately, expressing satisfaction with the prosecutor's fair attitude. Regarding the issue of compensation, Shen's father said that he had no idea and did not know when he would file a separate case. Shen Shao, who had always been serious and attentive to the public trial, carried the coat, cotton robe, and white pants that had been used as evidence with a smile, braving the snow and leaving the American military court with the people.

### Spring News from West Lake

— By Our Special Correspondent Chu Yusheng

Hangzhou Dispatch

Amidst the general economic downturn across the country, the Lunar New Year of the 35th year finally passed. Hangzhou—this paradise on earth—certainly experienced some somber days during the Lunar New Year. However, the past is gone and need not be revisited; we should follow the current path and look forward to the future.

In recent days, paradise has shed its impoverished appearance. Many shops display red paper ingots or red paper couplets, indicating a three-day rest for everyone. People wear new clothes, especially devout men and women, who, despite the heavy rain on Lunar New Year's Eve and the first day of the Lunar New Year, could not be deterred from their sincerity. They still climbed Jade Emperor Mountain to burn incense, some staying overnight on the mountain, others holding umbrellas or wearing raincoats to cross many hills to fulfill their vows at Three Tianzhu. Some also stayed there.

In the bustling city, the City God Mountain is also filled with incense. Many people hold incense and candles to beg the City God Buddha to forgive their sins of the past year. Humanity truly has a "root of goodness," and they make vows for "goodness." However, the Temple of the God of Wealth is also packed, as people seek prosperity in the coming year, hoping for more gold bars and the ability to buy property. The General Jinhua Temple, not far from Hubin Yingbai Road, is also bustling, as it is said that this Buddha is very effective, granting whatever is requested. When requests are not granted, it is naturally what people call "destiny."

Even in the Lakeside Pavilion, offerings of rice flour ingots, vegetarian ham, and vegetarian trotters are placed before the Guanzizai Bodhisattva. It turns out that the purely vegetarian "Guan Yin Bodhisattva" also desires meat and wealth.

Thousand-Yuan Legal Tender Fades

The custom of New Year's visits is also prevalent. Car services, rickshaws, and hand-pulled rickshaws are doing particularly well. New Year's gift packages wrapped in red paper are piled on the counters of southern goods stores for customers to choose from. Everyone hopes that giving a little gift will bring back a little gift, so southern goods stores are also thriving. After raising prices and "slaughtering the New Year pig," some vendors are now giving a "yuanbao" reward, meaning that giving them a little extra money will instantly turn into a yuanbao. People always love flattery, so they are naturally not stingy with this little money, especially after having passed the difficult New Year season. The 250-yuan and 500-yuan gold yuan coupons brought from Shanghai are active in the market, and many thousand-yuan legal tenders have faded. Several wealthy old men count the bills one by one, and the sounds of "huo, huo, huo" make people envious.

Trying Every Way to Find Happiness

Dance halls, having been reopened for sixteen days, can be indulged in to one's heart's content. Although a cup of clear tea sells for 5,000 yuan, what does it matter when banknotes are like waste paper, flying away piece by piece? Newspapers also report on secret dances in bathhouses. These are all ways to find happiness, and entertainment venues are naturally three times more profitable.

Various agencies and organizations have automatically taken holidays. Vegetables are hard to find, food shops have closed their stoves, and private chauffeurs have taken leave for the New Year. Many plump faces are flushed red, as they have enjoyed feasts in the government offices. On the streets, people push against each other, truly a scene of red-dressed women and green-dressed men. Cars follow car, truly a bustling scene. The long lines of people are all smiling, or rather, they must smile, because "not smiling will bring sorrow throughout the year." The streets are filled with the crackling sound of firecrackers, which is the children's way of celebrating the New Year. The magic of this Lunar New Year is so great. Why? Because China is a rural society. This New Year's rest for everyone can be said to be thanks to the benefits of the rural society.

Wind, Rain, and Snow - A Hint of Spring

During the Spring Festival, paradise experienced rain, wind, and snow. According to the boatmen on Hubin, "Although there are still a few days until the start of spring, the rain is continuous, like spring rain; the wind, sometimes gentle, sometimes strong, is heavy, like a 'zhi'er wind,' like a spring wind; the snow, flying and flying, is soft and weak, lazy, like spring snow." Yes, paradise already has a hint of spring. In order to find the news of spring, I hired a boat, sailed on the lake, and walked along Bai Causeway and Su Causeway, carefully observing its traces.

In the distance, a mountain range, the grass on the mountains has already begun to turn tender green. The mountains of Baoshi Mountain and the Chuyang Terrace have already painted the withered yellow color with light green oil paint. The willow trees on the embankment, having shed their pointed leaves, have begun to sprout new buds smaller than grains of rice, presenting a youthful atmosphere when viewed from afar.

Small islands, the Lakeside Pavilion, and Autumn Moon on the Calm Lake have all slowly opened their eyes. They looked at the vitality on the misty lake and smiled slightly, draped in light gauze, and half-dreamingly awakened.

The wild duck flocks, they already know that the lake water has begun to warm up. This lake, which was originally for them to play in, will become a paradise for people. These days, they are gathering to discuss how to steal food from the fields. But people are already planning how to capture them, in order to avoid harming the food supply, and their end is near.

Hurriedly Awaiting Tourists

Jingci Temple, Hupao Temple, Liuhe Pagoda, Lingyin Temple, and Jade Emperor Mountain Temple are all hastily opening their Buddhas for blessings. They have cleaned the Buddha halls and guest rooms, and hired famous vegetarian chefs to prepare for the enjoyment of tourists who come to burn incense in the spring. Shops selling prayer beads, walking sticks, cloth shoes, and wooden fish are all purchasing large quantities from the production areas in preparation for tourists to take back as souvenirs. Walnuts, Xiangfei, nine-flavored olives, and fragrant cakes are all being purchased in large quantities by the shops in preparation for tourists to take back some local products. Incense and candle shops are manufacturing incense and candles in large quantities, believing that this spring will definitely be busier than last year, because they have already devoutly worshiped the Buddhas. Even the photo studios in various scenic areas are also stirring up their spirits and working hard to prepare. Some have been newly decorated, and some have dreamed of importing many materials. This busy group is all looking forward to making a good deal this spring, taking advantage of the fame of the scenic spots and the light of the Buddhas to make a fortune.

Obtaining Snow Waves Brewed from Snow Seas

The wintersweet is already fading. The branches and trunks of several wintersweet trees in Zhongshan Park, with yellow flowers covering the ground, appear withered. The spring plum on Gushan is sprouting buds as green as soybeans, with a crimson color that is pleasing to the eye. Several branches in front of Yue Wang Tomb are also releasing tender green flower buds. The Fragrant Snow Sea of Chaoshan is brewing the moment of fragrant snow waves. They are all telling people that the sound of spring is already in front of West Lake. It wants to come suddenly, but West Lake has already awakened from its hibernation.

This year should be better than last year, right? For the people in paradise, when the news of spring has already arrived, how will you do this year to be better than last year?

### Arab Groups Insist on Their Position: Opposing the Partition of Palestine - London Round Table Conference Reopens Today - The Greater Syria Plan May Be Discussed at the Meeting

[Dispatch from Central News Agency, London, 25th] The Palestine Conference, which adjourned last October after more than three weeks of negotiations without reaching a result, will officially reconvene here on the 27th. British Foreign Secretary Bevin will lead the British delegation. Jewish representatives will refuse to attend, but Middle Eastern Arab countries, including Egypt, Iraq, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Transjordan, and Yemen, will all send representatives.

[Dispatch from Agence France-Presse, London, 25th] British Colonial Secretary Jones met with Hussein, Vice Chairman of the Palestine Arab Higher Committee, this morning to discuss matters. In fact, the Palestine Round Table Conference has already begun this morning. At the same time, it is generally acknowledged here that Britain will sooner or later support the organization of Greater Syria, so that Syria, Lebanon, Iraq, Transjordan, and even the Arab part of Palestine will be incorporated. According to news received here, the King of Saudi Arabia plans to convene a meeting of all Arab countries in the near future to discuss this plan. It is rumored that Saudi Arabian Crown Prince Faisal may be a candidate for the throne of Greater Syria, but this has been denied by well-informed Arab sources here. Furthermore, it is learned that the Arab representatives to the Palestine Round Table Conference rely on the support of all Arab countries to oppose the partition of Palestine and the continued influx of Jews, and demand the establishment of a provisional Palestinian government through democratic elections, and the establishment of an autonomous Palestinian state controlled by Arabs, guaranteeing the rights of the Jewish minority.

[Dispatch from Agence France-Presse, London, 25th] The London Palestine Round Table Conference is scheduled to reconvene on the 27th. It is reported that if the conference fails again, British Foreign Secretary Bevin will submit the Palestine issue to the United Nations General Assembly when it is held in the autumn of this year. According to a representative of the Arab delegation, they will insist on the position they adopted during the first half of the Round Table Conference, and will reject any plan other than the establishment of an independent Arab state in Palestine. The only concession the Arab delegation is willing to make is to allow cities with a Jewish majority to obtain autonomy. The Zionist movement, on the other hand, advocates the partition of Palestine and refuses to accept any plan that does not stipulate the establishment of an independent Jewish state. It is heard that the British Cabinet also has differing opinions on the issue. Colonial Secretary Jones advocates the partition of Palestine, while Foreign Secretary Bevin fears that this move may have adverse consequences and expresses his dissent.

### Anglo-Egyptian Negotiations Reverse: Will Be Submitted to the Security Council for Resolution - The Sticking Point Remains the Sudan Issue

[Dispatch from United Press, Cairo, 25th] An Egyptian cabinet member disclosed here today that the Egyptian cabinet has decided to submit the current issues involving negotiations with Britain to the United Nations Security Council for decision. Egyptian Prime Minister Nokrashi will announce this matter in parliament on Monday afternoon. It is heard that the Egyptian cabinet passed the above resolution after a three-hour meeting, unanimously rejecting Britain's recent proposal. This proposal concerns the Anglo-Egyptian negotiations to revise the 1936 Treaty of Alliance, remove British military bases from Egyptian territory, and resolve the issue of the status of the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan, but it has not yet been disclosed. The cabinet member also said: Egypt has always kept the door open for renegotiations with Britain, but it has now finally decided to submit this issue to the United Nations and stop direct negotiations with Britain. Well-informed sources say that the issue of removing British land, sea, and air forces and their facilities from Egyptian territory can be satisfactorily resolved within 23 years. However, the entire issue hinges on the future status of Sudan. Egypt demands complete sovereignty over this region, while Britain advocates holding a plebiscite to determine the wishes of the Sudanese people. Sudanese leaders want to achieve independence.

British Statement

[Dispatch from Reuters, Cairo, 26th] The British Embassy here issued a statement tonight: According to political circles in London, although negotiations between Britain and Egypt on the Sudan issue have reached an extremely delicate stage, London has not abandoned hope that an agreement can still be reached. In the past two days, British Foreign Secretary Bevin has visited the Egyptian ambassador to London twice, and the British ambassador to Cairo has also held long talks with Egyptian Prime Minister Nokrashi. In fact, contact between the two sides is still being fully maintained, and both countries are seeking a Sudan plan that is satisfactory to both governments. British officials believe that the door to negotiations is still open today. British officials do not agree with the pessimistic atmosphere caused by the responsible parties in Cairo claiming that the negotiations have broken down. The statement also stated: Apart from the Sudan issue, the two governments have completely agreed on the revision of the Anglo-Egyptian treaty. The disagreement between the two governments on the Sudan issue stems from differing interpretations of the Sudan agreement drafted by Bevin and then-Egyptian Prime Minister Sidqi in London last autumn.

### British Criticize Polish Actions

[Report from our agency] London, broadcasted on the 26th: Brockway, secretary of the Independent Labor Party and secretary of the British Committee of the Indian National Congress, made a speech stating that if the United Nations turns a blind eye to the Polish government's expulsion of German expatriates from Silesia, it will no longer be able to condemn the Nazis. Even the Potsdam Agreement clearly stipulated that such actions should meet humanitarian standards. It is noted that during World War I, Brockway was summoned to court nine times for the crime of "inciting anti-war sentiment." During World War II, he printed pamphlets on the independent labor movement.

### British Plane Crash

[Dispatch from Agence France-Presse, London, 25th] A "Dakota" type plane crashed at Croydon Airport today, killing ten passengers and two crew members.

### Anglo-Soviet Relations: Will Enter a New Phase - Bevin Plans to Discuss Amending the Alliance Treaty with the Soviets - Stalin's So-Called Reservations Arouse Speculation

[Dispatch from Central News Agency, London, 25th] Diplomatic observers here predict that Anglo-Soviet relations may enter a new phase since Stalin accepted Bevin's reaffirmation that the Anglo-Soviet Alliance Treaty is still valid. It is believed that Bevin will take advantage of his trip to Moscow in March to attend the Four Powers Conference to discuss various possibilities regarding the amendment of the treaty with Stalin.

[Dispatch from United Press, London, 25th] After Britain and the Soviet Union exchanged notes reaffirming the validity of the 1942 Anglo-Soviet Alliance Treaty, Anglo-Soviet cooperation has unfolded in a broad new situation. Observers in both Moscow and London declare that the amendment and expansion of this treaty may lay a brand new foundation for cooperation between the two powers. The British side is awaiting further clarification of what Stalin meant in his note to Bevin when he advocated eliminating the weak clauses in the alliance treaty.

[Dispatch from Agence France-Presse, London, 25th] Since Britain and France issued a joint communique announcing that the two countries were about to conclude an alliance treaty, Britain and the Soviet Union have also exchanged notes several times, and Anglo-Soviet relations have thus improved. Diplomatic circles here generally believe that the improvement of Anglo-Soviet relations will strengthen the domestic and foreign positions of Prime Minister Attlee and Foreign Secretary Bevin. It is noted that a year ago, Anglo-Soviet relations were strained, and the United States also believed that there was indeed a hostile sentiment between Britain and the Soviet Union.

[Dispatch from Reuters, London, 26th] London newspapers published today generally believe that the letters exchanged between Stalin and British Foreign Secretary Bevin have partly cleared the diplomatic air, but they are speculating about the nature of Stalin's so-called "reservations" regarding the Anglo-Soviet treaty. The diplomatic correspondent of the Observer said that Stalin's reservations can be understood by comparing the Anglo-Soviet treaty with the alliances subsequently concluded by the Soviet Union with France, Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, and Poland. The Anglo-Soviet alliance is only effective if Germany or one of its former satellite countries attacks the Soviet Union or Britain. The Polish-Soviet alliance stipulates that the two contracting countries should take all possible measures to eliminate any threat of aggression from Germany or any country that directly or indirectly unites with Germany. In other words, the Anglo-Soviet alliance is purely defensive, while the Polish-Soviet alliance can be interpreted as including the previous war. The diplomatic correspondent of the Sunday Times believes that Stalin's intention is to recognize that some kind of psychological reservation may arise from conflicts in various international arenas such as the Mediterranean, the Tatar Strait, and the policies recently caused by Spitzbergen.

Montgomery's Speech on His Impressions of Visiting the Soviet Union

### Greek Authorities Refuse Entry to Yugoslav Representatives

[Report from our agency] London, broadcast on the 26th: Yugoslavia planned to send a delegation to Athens, but it has been rejected by the Greek authorities. A spokesperson for the Yugoslav Foreign Ministry recently made a statement on this matter, stating that the purpose of the Yugoslav delegation's visit to Greece was merely to assist the United Nations in conducting investigations into the Greek border disputes. The Greek authorities' refusal to allow the Yugoslav delegation to enter the country is tantamount to disrupting the work of the United Nations.

### The First Draft of the Austrian Treaty Completed - Acknowledging Austria's Independence and Sovereignty - The Decision to Prevent German-Austrian Unification is Recorded in the Appendix - France Will Continue to Submit Memoranda on the German Question

[United Press London, 25th] The Council of Foreign Ministers' Deputies today completed the second week of its preparatory work for drafting the German and Austrian peace treaties. Only one sentence of the treaty has been drafted, and its original text has not been released. However, it was agreed that Austria's freedom and independence should be recognized. This principle was already agreed upon at the New York Council of Foreign Ministers. The US representative, Clark, sarcastically said that this one sentence was a "great achievement." Clark will chair the meeting on the 27th and intends to expedite the proceedings. Clark will add several expert committees to divide the work and cooperate to complete the work of the Council of Foreign Ministers' Deputies before the Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference on March 10th. The representatives were originally scheduled to meet today to hear Canada's views on the German peace treaty, but the Canadian government stated that it was not prepared to express its views, so the meeting was temporarily canceled.

[National News Agency London, 25th] The four foreign ministers decided today to discuss measures to prevent German-Austrian unification. The British representative stated that such guarantees should be included in a special appendix until Austria can guarantee its own security within the scope of the United Nations. The US representative advocated formulating a plan to integrate the guarantees provided by the Allied countries and the United Nations for Austria's independence. The French representative agreed with the British representative's opinion. The Soviet representative also did not object to including measures to prohibit German-Austrian unification in the appendix.

### Italians Dissatisfied with the Peace Treaty - Rumors of Plans to Scuttle Ships

[Reuters Rome, 25th] The French envoy delivered a formal document to the Italian Foreign Ministry today, formally requesting the Italian government to send one or more representatives to Paris next month to sign the peace treaty. [United Press, Taranto, Italy, 26th] The Italian peace treaty stipulates that the Italian fleet is limited to two old battleships, four cruisers and destroyers each, and other small boats, which has caused a strong reaction at this major Italian naval base. There is much talk about Italian sailors or generals scuttling ships rather than handing them over to the United Nations. According to naval sources, the United Nations promised Italy before the armistice on September 3, 1943, that if it joined the United Nations, it would be allowed to keep its fleet.

### US State Department Official Accuses the Soviet Union of Distorting Facts

[United Press Washington, 25th] A US State Department official tonight accused the Soviet Union of directing large-scale propaganda activities in various European countries, deliberately concealing or distorting the statements made by US officials, and exaggerating American life into a strange and chaotic situation in a radio broadcast here. Stone of the State Department's International Information Service, Ries, and Shia of the US Information Service in Rome all stated that the Soviet Union always refers to Americans as "warmongering, aggressive, wealthy, extravagant, and imperialist people." Shia said that, for example, the propaganda organs controlled by the Soviet Union in Romania reported the speeches of former US Secretary of State Byrnes and Senator Vandenberg, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, "almost changing the original meaning of the two men." Vandenberg said after the Four Power Paris Peace Conference, "The Soviet Union does not want war," and "The United States does not want war urgently," but Romanian newspapers only reported the words "The Soviet Union does not want war." "This is not a distortion of reporting, it is simply a brutal dismemberment." Byrnes's speech mentioned the withdrawal of troops stationed in Europe and the principle of free trade on the Danube River, but Romanian newspapers did not mention a word. Tonys said that Byrnes's speech in Stuttgart described the question of Poland's future borders, but the communist-controlled Polish newspapers and radio stations did not mention a word.

### Vietnamese Longing for their Homeland - Vietnamese Workers in France Eager to be Repatriated

[Reuters Marseilles, 25th] 12,000 Vietnamese workers are now urgently awaiting repatriation by the authorities. This may be the best example of how Easterners treat Westerners today, and it shows that the East has not been moved by the West. These workers have been in contact with European civilization for about seven years, and they still have no intention of staying. They are now living in camps set up by the French government in various places, one of the largest of which is located in the town of Machag, just east of Marseilles.

A Reuters reporter visited the camp and saw 2,000 Vietnamese living in the camp. The entire camp is divided into seven teams, each with a representative or spokesperson. Each representative thoroughly expressed their opinions, saying that between 1939 and 1940, France recruited 14,000 Vietnamese workers to France to work in agriculture and forestry, etc. Although it was stipulated that they would be sent back to Vietnam immediately after the end of the war, only about 2,000 people have been sent back so far. The French authorities claimed that the delay in repatriation was due to a lack of ships, but in recent months France has transported tens of thousands of troops to the Far East. Where did the ships come from? It can be seen that their words are self-defeating.

It also said: We used to be under French jurisdiction and were treated like slaves, without enough clothes to wear and enough food to eat. We only received two francs in wages per day. The treatment we receive today is quite satisfactory. We have full freedom in the camp to express our opinions and engage in political activities, but we are not allowed to hold public demonstrations. What we want is the complete independence of Vietnam, without any discounts. We have witnessed European nations and politics, but we have not seen anything admirable. Technically, we still need to learn a lot, but we feel capable of creating our own way of life and our own political philosophy. During the war, we heard many words. We believe in the Atlantic Charter and other statements by the Allies that told us that we could enter a new era. The French government was very happy to have our labor and soldiers to help during the war, but now the promises made by France and Britain to colonial nations under the difficulties of war seem to be turning back on their word.

The representatives repeatedly mentioned their hope that the United States would intervene to end the war in Vietnam. They see Britain as a powerful country with colonies, so they have no sympathy for the national aspirations of the Vietnamese people. They are quite concerned about the Soviet Union and communism. Many Vietnamese are particularly moved by the Soviet Union's handling of its ethnic problems. The longer these Vietnamese stay in France, the more determined their will will be. They will not be messengers of goodwill when they return to their homeland one day.

### US Officials Accuse the Soviet Union of Secretly Building Atomic Bomb Factories - US Plans Emergency Industrial Mobilization to Prevent Eventualities

[Central News Agency Washington, 25th United Press] US Atomic Energy Commission Chairman McMahon said in a farewell speech when he retired that the Soviet Union is secretly building an atomic bomb factory in Siberia. After McMahon's retirement, Senator Hickenlooper succeeded him in his vacancy.

[United Press New York, 25th] Robinson, head of the Wartime Army Service Group, said in an article published in the current issue of "American Magazine" that the United States is preparing an emergency industrial mobilization plan to cope with a possible third world war. Robinson said that think tanks from the Army, Navy, and private industry are drafting a secret plan for the entire industrial mobilization, so that American factories can be converted to wartime production in a flash. President Truman is closely supervising this plan. Military leaders fear that another world war is brewing, and the United States may be at a disadvantage. The United States has atomic bombs and does more harm than good. Atomic bombs may not even be used in future wars. The best way to achieve victory and avoid another war is only to make the American industrial war machine ready to cope with sudden changes at any time. The Army Department expects that atomic bombs will be completely banned in future wars. The fear of retaliation will prevent the belligerents from violating the promise to ban atomic bombs.

### Japan Brews a Major Strike - Negotiations Between the Government and Labor Representatives Yield No Results

[Kaizo-sha Tokyo, 25th] The brewing nationwide labor strike in Japan reached a delicate stage today. Representatives from the National Public Service Employees Association, the National Communications Workers Union, the National Railway Workers' Union, the City Alliance, the National Financial Institutions Association, the Ministry of Finance Association, the Urban Labor Federation, Universities, Higher Specialized Schools, the National Teachers Association, the Communist Party, and the Socialist Party held an expanded struggle committee today to discuss and decide on the final attitude, focusing on (1) the attitude during the negotiations with Prime Minister Yoshida on the 25th, (2) the attitude of each union, and (3) holding a discussion with the Socialist and Communist parties.

### German Nazi Remnants - Still Trying to Revive - Report of the European Problems Research Association

[United Press London, 25th] The International Research Association for European Problems, composed of leaders from Britain, France, Belgium, Denmark, and the Netherlands, recently submitted a report to the prime ministers and foreign ministers of the Allied countries, explaining that the strength of a certain Nazi organization in Germany is increasing month by month. It is said that the Nazi Party has recovered from the initial shock of Germany's success or failure and is now quietly reorganizing in order to seize control of the democratic institutions supported by the Allied countries in order to revive its power. The report stated that this Nazi organization is commanded by old Nazi figures, foreign troublemakers, and German officers. One of them was released by General Clay, commander of the US military in Germany, under an amnesty order last July. The Nazi organization is currently only engaged in passive resistance, and its methods are as follows: (1) Obstructing the Nazi purge and trying to place its own people in important positions as much as possible. (2) Investigating the public and private lives of Germans and using agitation or intimidation to maintain nationalistic sentiment. (3) Disrupting the industrial and agricultural institutions controlled by the Allied countries, increasing their difficulties, and inducing the Allied countries to gradually return control to the Germans. The report continued: According to a thorough study of the situation, with the exception of a few Germans who seem to have sincere goodwill, the majority of the German people have never entered the democratic stage.

The election method stipulates that district residents' representatives will be convened to vote. The Municipal Civil Affairs Bureau will also send personnel to the election site to supervise. Mayor Wu, Director of the Civil Affairs Bureau Zhang Xiaosong, and others will personally visit the election site to inspect and guide. This district chief election is an unprecedented initiative. The registered candidates have been reviewed and announced. In the past two days, various districts have launched election activities, and the atmosphere is quite enthusiastic. However, it is different from the previous election for municipal councilors, because the district chief election only involves contacting district residents' representatives.

It is planned to hold elections in one to two districts every day, which will be completed within three weeks.

In addition, the schedule for the election of district chiefs in Luwan District is scheduled to be held on the morning of the 30th of this month. The district has followed the regulations, compiled the register of voters, and posted it publicly at the district office five days before the election.

### State-Operated China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Readjusts All Shipping Routes; Hai Xia Ship Trial Voyage to Bangkok; China-Philippines Route Changed to Hai Min Ship

[Report from Our Newspaper] The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company is striving to adjust all shipping routes in order to develop its business. Schedules were previously established for the Yangtze River route, but due to seasonal and environmental influences, sailings have not been able to follow the established schedule. Accurate schedules are generally expected when the river water rises. The North and South Ocean routes have also been repeatedly reorganized, but without effect due to various factors. Recently, the company has once again readjusted the schedules for all sea shipping routes. The details announced by the company are recorded below: Shanghai-Guangzhou route: Served by the Hai Sui ship, with a round trip every two weeks. Shanghai-Xiamen-Guangzhou route: Served by the Zhongkai and Hanmin ships, sailing opposite each other once a week. Shanghai-Shantou-Guangzhou route: Served by the Linsen and Peide ships, sailing opposite each other once a week. Shanghai-Wenzhou-Fuzhou route: The Hai Hu ship makes a round trip every two weeks. Shanghai-Keelung route: Served by the Hai Qian and Hai Su ships, sailing opposite each other every ten days. Shanghai-Kaohsiung-Hong Kong route: Served by the Hai Yue ship, once every three weeks (trial basis). Furthermore, the Hai Xia ship, previously assigned to the China-Philippines route, underwent repairs in Hong Kong for over two months. It completed repairs and returned to Shanghai on the 20th. Currently, it needs to go to Siam to load rice and is being reassigned to the China-Siam route, also calling at Shantou, Hong Kong, and Bangkok, with one sailing every three weeks. The first sailing to Bangkok is scheduled for the 29th, and passenger tickets will be sold to carry passengers and cargo. After this trial run, it will operate the China-Siam route on a long-term basis. The Hai Xia ship is beautifully equipped and has obtained a passenger license for ocean-going vessels from the British government, meeting modern standards for ocean-going vessels, and is therefore extremely safe and comfortable. The China-Philippines route will be served by the Hai Min ship, starting from Xiamen via Hong Kong to Little Luzon, scheduled for one sailing every two weeks. The Hai Min ship is currently berthed in Guangzhou Bay and will soon sail to Xiamen to begin operations.

North and South Ocean Routes Offer Intermodal Transport

### Prominent Figures From All Walks of Life Call for Peace; Launch Signature Campaign for Peace Movement; Hope for National Support; Promote the Great Cause of Peaceful National Reconstruction

[Report from Our Newspaper] Wang Xiaolai, Wu YunChu, and other individuals from the industrial, commercial, educational, legal, journalistic, and professional circles of this city, recognizing that domestic turmoil and war have continued to grow after the victory, leading to transportation obstruction, currency inflation, and the entire nation and people being on the verge of danger, have been compelled to issue a call of conscience, without any political bias, and have launched a signature campaign for a peace movement, calling for an immediate end to domestic turmoil and the realization of peace, in order to complete the great cause of democratic national reconstruction with united strength. At 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon, Wang and others specially hosted the local and foreign press at the Hong Kong Road Bankers Club to report on the initiation of the peace movement. Present were initiators Wang Xiaolai, Wu YunChu, Chen Tingrui, Shou Jingwei, Jin Runxiang, Hu Qiuyuan, Duanmu Kai, Chen Zhitang, and fifty to sixty reporters from various Chinese and foreign newspapers.

Strictly Impartial, Fair, and Unselfish

First, Mr. Wang Xiaolai gave a report, stating that the current peace movement initiated by people from the industrial, commercial, and professional circles, a portion of the names, has already been seen on the Declaration for the Peace Movement, including people from the industrial, commercial, legal, accounting, educational, financial, and journalistic circles. The motivation for the peace movement has been detailed in the declaration and need not be repeated. All initiators believe that peace is of paramount importance for the current domestic situation. Without peace, everything will be on the verge of collapse. Therefore, they have no choice but to make a call of conscience and launch a peace movement. Various industrial and commercial figures have been contacted and considered this matter many times before finally announcing it. This movement does not involve any political parties or government; it is initiated and participated in individually by people from the industrial, commercial, and professional circles, calling for peace, hoping to gain support from all sectors of the country, so as to gather strength and promote the great cause of peaceful national reconstruction. Therefore, the position of the peace movement is strictly impartial, fair, and unselfish. If people from the industrial, commercial, and professional circles agree with this movement, they can sign their names in support. Once the response expands, a peace movement conference will be established. In the future, they will continue to call for peace. Once peace is realized, this peace movement will be declared terminated.

Comprehensive Opinions from All Parties Submitted to the General Assembly for Discussion and Decision

After Mr. Wang finished speaking, the reporters raised several questions. Wang Xiaolai, Hu Qiuyuan, Chen Tingrui, Duanmu Kai, and others answered them separately. The main points are recorded as follows: (1) The method of promoting the peace movement is currently integrating the opinions of all initiators, and then submitting them to the future general assembly for discussion and decision. (2) The peace movement does not intend to mediate as a new third party. (3) The preparatory committee for the peace movement initiators, and all rules, are currently being prepared and implemented. The peace movement has not specifically designated anyone to lead it. However, the initiators present today may take on some administrative responsibilities. (4) If the peace movement gains a response from the government and the CCP, it will have achieved a considerable purpose. As for the terms of the peace talks, the overall goal is to be fair and reasonable. (5) Laborers and others must also participate in the peace movement in their individual capacity. As for whether to send representatives to Nanjing or Yan'an to petition, it will be decided at the general assembly. The reception ended at around 4:00 PM.

### Declaration of the Peace Movement

The full text of the Declaration of the Peace Movement and the list of initiators who have signed in support up to now are as follows: After eight years of victory in the War of Resistance, we could have peacefully unified and built a democratic and prosperous country. Unfortunately, domestic war has continued to prolong and expand. The world is celebrating peace, but our country's state of war has not yet ended. A poor and weak country has been bleeding for ten years, and is still bleeding. We will not perish from Japanese aggression, but we will perish from our own internal strife. This is a matter of great pain for the people of the whole country, and it is difficult to endure for long.

The people of the whole country are on the verge of not being able to survive. The status of the country is also declining day by day. Due to the war, tens of thousands of compatriots continue to fall into ditches and scattered in all directions. Due to the war, transportation is blocked, and currency continues to inflate. As a result, farmers and workers are unemployed, industrial and commercial businesses are bankrupt, and all other professionals are insecure. Today, society is disintegrating, and people are uneasy. Not only is political reform and economic construction out of the question, but all abnormal and immoral events will inevitably spread more and more. If the war does not stop, the tragedy of mutual destruction is at hand. If we think about how the international community will soon discuss the peace treaty with Japan, at that time, China, which fought for peace, will not be able to protect the peace within its borders, not only will the reasonable demands be rejected, but it may also suffer unexpected setbacks. Then, even the fruits of the War of Resistance and the future of the country will be completely ruined.

The people of the whole country are on the lines of starvation and death. The root of all misfortunes is war. Therefore, we cannot but painfully issue a call of conscience: to demand an end to meaningless war, to demand the restoration of peace and order. Only then can we complete the great cause of democratic national reconstruction with a unified and united force. We have no prejudice against any political parties. We only ask that disputes not be resolved by force, but that peace be achieved through negotiation.

This kind of call for peace has been made more than once in the past, and all have inevitably encountered various difficulties. However, we really cannot survive, and we can no longer care about so much. We are unwilling to trace the past, and we hope that everyone will not settle old scores. Instead of examining others, examine yourself, and forgive others as you forgive yourself. We are only weeping and saying, hoping to immediately turn swords into ploughshares, immediately stop the war, and immediately resume peace talks. We are all people with occupations and are determined not to be involved in the current vortex of political disputes; we only hope for peace in the world and to live and work in peace and contentment. We cannot sit idly by and watch industry, commerce, and the national lifeline continue to be destroyed by internal strife. We have to stand up and urgently call on all parties to return peace to us; and after this call is made, we will reserve the right to morally criticize the attitudes of all parties towards peace. We will continue to call. Once peace is realized, our movement will be declared terminated.

No ceasefire means destruction, only peace can build the country. We hope that all compatriots in the country, especially those in all walks of life, will unite, use the power of national opinion, the inspiration of national conscience, and the spirit and attitude of fairness and selflessness to promote the realization of peace, unity, and democracy. The revival of the country depends on this one action. The future of the nation depends on it. This is our declaration.

### Ensure the Safety of Passengers at Sea; Ministry of Communications Orders Reward Measures for Rescue; All Boatmen and Fishermen Near Ship Accidents Must Do Their Utmost to Rescue

In coastal and river areas throughout the country, whenever ship accidents occur, wooden boats, barges, and fishermen moored on both sides often watch the passengers and crew who have fallen into the water without helping, hoping to loot goods. During the collision between the Zhijiang and Huatong ships at the Wusongkou this time, it was also discovered that a large number of barges were robbing luggage and goods. In order to ensure the safety of passengers at sea, the Ministry of Communications has specially formulated reward measures for the rescue of shipping accidents and ordered all maritime authorities in the country to implement them diligently: (1) In the event of a ship accident, in addition to the captain of the ship and other ships providing assistance and rescue in accordance with the provisions of maritime law, nearby wooden boatmen and fishermen must do their utmost to rescue. Anyone who rescues a surviving passenger or crew member from the water, after being proven true, will be rewarded with 50,000 yuan in national currency. Anyone who recovers a corpse, after being proven true, will be rewarded with 30,000 yuan in national currency. The above rewards will be paid by the shipping company or firm of the accident ship. (2) In addition to the aforementioned bonus, those rescued or their family members and relatives are free to reward those who provide assistance if they are willing, but the rescuers must not extort. (3) In the event of a ship accident, if nearby ship boatmen and fishermen do not provide assistance, the military police or the ship's escort team may force them to provide assistance or directly take their boats to provide assistance, without any reward after the event. (4) In the event of a ship accident, anyone who takes the opportunity to loot goods and luggage will be sent to court for strict handling once discovered. The local maritime affairs bureau has been ordered to implement this conscientiously.

### Western Book Merchants Face Difficulties in Applying for Foreign Exchange; Dim Prospects for Business

[Report from Our Newspaper] Since the implementation of import control measures, the import of Western books and magazines has been greatly reduced. Foreign bookstores in the city are complaining about business difficulties. Mr. Motiemo, the manager of the Sino-American Book Company, whose main business is selling textbooks and reference books, spoke to reporters yesterday about the situation in the book industry and believes that the future is hopeless. According to him, since the promulgation of the import control regulations, it has been extremely difficult to apply for foreign exchange for Western books, so new books have not been ordered for several months. The books currently being sold are all orders placed before the implementation of the controls. There are also many troubles and delays in settling foreign exchange for the book debts that should be paid for past orders, so **'s invoices have not been paid, which has a great impact on business operations. He urgently hopes that the government will amend the import control measures.

### Strange Guest's Terrifying New Year's Gift; Ambush Outside the Gate of Great China University Fails to Catch Blackmailer

At the home of Ni Guanqun, a local businessman at No. 1 Sujiaojiao, Changning Road, at around 2:00 PM the day before yesterday, a man suddenly came to offer New Year's greetings, claiming to be surnamed Li, and carrying two boxes of gifts that looked like fruit. Ni happened to be out visiting for the New Year, and only his wife, Gendi, was at home. She went out to greet him, offered tea and cigarettes, and treated him cordially. After a while, the man surnamed Li said, "Since Mr. Ni is not at home, I will not stay long, please give him my regards," and then left. Soon after, Ni returned, and Gendi told him that a guest surnamed Li had visited and left two boxes of gifts. Ni thought for a long time and had no friends surnamed Li, which was very strange. After opening the two original gift boxes, one contained a bottle of nitric acid and a pair of scissors, and the other contained a letter. Upon opening it, it was a threatening letter, demanding a large sum of money from Ni and instructing him to meet at the gate of Great China University on the afternoon of the 25th to negotiate payment, otherwise there would be unfavorable consequences. Ni immediately took the "gifts" to the Changning Road Police Station to report the incident. The Second Division sent officers to go to the address with Ni on time. They waited for a long time in front of the school gate, but nothing was gained, and the investigation is still in progress.

### The Judicial Yuan Has a Unified Interpretation of the Issue of Paying Deed Tax During the Occupation; The Method of Assessing Standard Prices Should Be Abolished

[Report from Our Newspaper] During the occupation period in this city, the sale and purchase of real estate was all calculated in puppet currency under the control of the enemy puppets. After the victory, the issue of how to pay the deed tax has not been resolved. The Finance Bureau received a unified interpretation from the Judicial Yuan through the Ministry of Finance regarding the payment of puppet currency debts in the occupied areas: "For debts originally paid in puppet currency by the parties in the occupied areas, after the government stipulates the ratio of puppet currency to legal tender, the legal tender should be used to repay them according to this ratio, but it does not hinder the application of Article 12 of the Supplementary Regulations for Civil Litigation after Restoration." Regarding deed tax, it should be handled in accordance with these regulations, and the previous regulations on assessing standard prices should be abolished. After receiving the telegram, the Finance Bureau has sent a document to the Land Administration Bureau to comply with it from now on.

### Huang Pang is Unhappy After Seeking Pleasure; Gathers a Crowd to Cause Trouble at a Brothel

The Qianmeng Brothel on the upper floor of No. 9 Qunyu Lane, Shantou Road, was formerly the Qianmeng Guide Agency. A rickshaw puller named Huang Pang is a regular customer of the younger sister (prostitute's name) of the brothel. He has visited several times, either staying overnight or taking the prostitute out. At around 8:00 PM the day before yesterday, Huang Pang brought five or six friends to **, often paying 30,000 yuan for a night's stay, intending to take the younger sister out. Yu Bing, the accountant of the brothel, thought that since it was the New Year, this meager amount might not be approved by the prostitute, so he asked him to add another 10,000 yuan. However, Huang Pang expressed dissatisfaction, threw the 30,000 yuan in cash on the account table, and left with his friends. After a while, he telephoned ** the younger sister to the Old Oriental Hotel.

### Shanghai Municipal Government Allocates Saigon Rice to Suppress Fluctuations in Post-New Year Rice Prices

Social Affairs Bureau Convenes Rice Merchants to Discuss Procedures

The Lunar New Year holiday is over, and all markets have resumed trading today. Regarding food, although rice shops opened yesterday, prices remained uncertain as the market had not yet opened. Concerned about price fluctuations after the holiday, the authorities prepared in advance to allocate Saigon rice under their control at negotiated prices.

The allocation price was set at 63,000 yuan per dan (a unit of weight) for the market and 70,000 yuan per dan for retail sales. According to the Municipal Government, the rice reserves under its control are extremely abundant. In the event of price fluctuations today, the Municipal Government will immediately allocate Saigon rice to suppress the price, so it is expected that rice prices will not fluctuate significantly.

### Registration of Oil, Paper, and Rubber Imports Completed; Small-Scale Importers to be Eliminated

The registration work of the Wheel Management Committee has gradually begun. Initially, merchants will be required to declare past import quantities, and banks will verify the accuracy of the figures to create reliable statistics. So far, statistics for oil, paper, and rubber have been completed. Efforts are being made to expedite the collection of statistics for American cotton. Once the statistics are completed, a committee meeting will be convened to determine quotas. However, it is reported that among the more than 4,000 applicants, over 1,000 may be eliminated due to their smaller business volumes. Applications from small businesses with a trade volume of less than US$1,000 in American cotton last year will not be considered. This will allow imports to be concentrated in a small number of large merchants and reduce unnecessary competition.

### New York Silver Prices Plunge Last Monday

[Reuters, New York, 25th] Silver prices plummeted 5.25 cents per ounce last Monday (January 20th), the most severe drop since December 8, 1920. Silver prices also plunged 5.25 cents on that day due to a large company implementing price cuts to attract buyers. Historically, the highest record of a silver price plunge was 10.25 cents on June 7, 1920. Since silver prices began to decline last December, Kodak Company can save at least $3 million annually. At the same time, demands from silver merchants to abolish the 50% silver transaction profit tax have become increasingly vocal. Consumers in the East have also complained about the U.S. Treasury Department's law to buy domestic silver at a price of 90.5 cents per ounce. Silverware manufacturers expect silver production in 1947 to more than double the record in 1941, but even this amount will not be able to meet wartime orders.

### Opening Prices for Coal, Firewood, and Charcoal Rise Across the Board

In the coal market, opening prices for various types of bituminous coal have risen across the board. In terms of transactions, only small urgent needs have seen some trading, while the rest are temporarily observing the market.

Transactions are quite lively, with prices not differing much from the previous market.

### Gold Prices in Beiping Soar; Gold Shops Suffer Heavy Losses

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 25th] Financial circles here report that the sharp rise in gold prices in Beiping has caused significant losses for many gold shops. Eleven gold shop managers fled before the Lunar New Year. The unofficial market price today, the sixth day of the Lunar New Year, is 560,000 yuan, and it is generally believed that it will rise to 660,000 yuan after the market opens. Insiders say that there are three reasons for this sharp rise, which far exceeds the prices in Shanghai: first, large amounts of gold bond certificates; second, the plane crash and the suspension of flights to Shanghai; and third, a certain party purchased 400 bars of gold at once in Beiping. Due to the soaring gold prices and the expansion of the war, peace talks are faltering, and general commodity prices have also been greatly affected. On average, prices have risen by 60% to 100% compared to two weeks ago, with cloth seeing the largest price increases.

### Hong Kong Strives to Restore the Cotton Textile Industry

[United Press, Hong Kong, 26th] Hong Kong hopes to quickly restore its important position in supplying cotton products to overseas markets. Cotton textiles were Hong Kong's largest industry before the war.

The immediate result will be the employment of a large number of unemployed workers in cotton textile factories. Before the war, the cotton textile industry employed 70,000 workers, with an additional 50,000 engaged in supporting work.

Before the war, Hong Kong consumed 20,000 tons of cotton yarn annually to manufacture bedsheets, socks, sportswear, underwear, and more.

Countries that purchased cotton products from Hong Kong included Malaya, Siam, the Dutch East Indies, South Africa, British West Indies, French Vietnam, China, East Africa and West Africa, the Philippines, Borneo, and the United Kingdom.

### Developing Overseas Markets for Silk Products: Silk Export Guidance Association Established; United Company to Manufacture Silk Fabrics for Export to the UK and Southeast Asia

Due to the low international prices of raw silk, which are insufficient to cover costs, exports of our raw silk have been halted for a long time, and our silk industry is in a state of great distress. In order to alleviate the difficulties of our raw silk and silk weaving industries, national financial institutions, initiated by the Central Bank, invited four organizations, including the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, the China Trust Bureau, and the China Silk Corporation, to form the Shanghai Silk Export Guidance Association to find a suitable way out for the raw silk and silk weaving industries. The Association was formally established the other day, with Lin Fengbao, Director of the Central Bank, serving as the chairman and Wang Zijian, Deputy Chairman of the China Trust Bureau's Sales Association, serving as the vice-chairman. It is understood that the Association's main task is to process raw silk into silk fabrics and then export them to earn foreign exchange to offset import surpluses. The importance of its mission is self-evident. For the sake of convenience, the Association has also established a Business Management Office to be responsible for implementing all the tasks set within the Association. Wang Xingsu, Deputy Director of the Business Department of the China Silk Corporation, has been appointed as the director of the office and has actively started work. It has been decided to supply the raw silk and rayon purchased and stored by the China Trust Bureau to the silk weaving industry in stages for weaving various silk fabrics. In the first phase, 1,400 dan of factory silk and 2,400 boxes of rayon will be provided. The organizational structure of the Chinese silk weaving industry will be coordinated. After many consultations with the silk weaving industry, the Shanghai Silk Weaving Industry Production and Marketing Joint Company was organized and signed a weaving contract with the Association. The Export Guidance Association will provide wages, and finished products that pass inspection will be processed once every Wednesday, with a monthly interest rate of 3%. It is understood that there are more than 5,000 silk weaving machines in this city. It has now been decided to use 2,500 machines for export weaving. The raw materials supplied in the first phase can be woven into 80,000 pieces of silk fabric, with more than ten varieties. After the finished products are made, they will be shipped by the Association to the UK, France, India, and Southeast Asia for sale, which is more cost-effective than exporting raw silk. Our endangered silk and silk weaving industries are all encouraged by this measure.

### Difficulties in Studying in the UK and the US; Easier to Transfer to Other Countries

Netherlands Offers Free Tuition; Decision to be Made Within Four Months

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing Air News] The Ministry of Education previously decided to recruit 1,200 self-funded students to study abroad. However, due to the large number of returning veterans resuming their studies in the UK and the US after the war, the schools are overcrowded. So far, only a little over 100 people have completed the procedures to go abroad, and there is still no solution for the rest. According to those familiar with the situation, it is easier for self-funded students to go abroad if they can change their plans from studying in the UK and the US to other European countries. Otherwise, it is unknown how long they will have to wait to go abroad. In addition, the Netherlands previously sent a letter to the Ministry of Education offering four tuition waivers. The Ministry of Education has approved the registration of self-funded students, and the decision will be made by the end of this month at the latest.

### Teachers and Staff of Private Schools to Petition This Morning

Will Request the Government to Take Over Private Schools

The Liaison Association of Teachers and Staff of Private Primary and Secondary Schools in this city is dissatisfied with the private school tuition standards resolved by the second meeting of the Municipal Council. In addition to issuing a statement a few days ago, it has also decided to petition the Municipal Education Bureau and the three organizations of the Municipal Council this morning. It is stated that if tuition fees are collected according to the standards passed by the Council, private schools will be unable to maintain themselves. Therefore, they request the government to nationalize all private schools in the city in order to maintain education. This petition will require each school to send at least two representatives to gather at the New Huanzhong School at 10 am this morning. They will take ten large trucks to the Municipal Government first to visit Mayor Wu, then to the Municipal Education Bureau to seek an audience with Director Gu, and then to the Municipal Council to seek an audience with Chairman Pan to submit the above requests in person. It is heard that the goal of the petition is not to focus on the tuition standards, but to request the government to take over all private schools in the city.

In addition, it is reported that the Private School Principals' Association will hold a general meeting at Yucai Middle School on Shanhai Pass Road at 2 pm on the 29th. At that time, they will independently decide on the private school fee standards and refuse to implement the standards discussed by the Municipal Council.

As the school year is about to begin and living conditions are becoming increasingly difficult, the Association convened a committee at Datong University yesterday afternoon to discuss continuing to request the Ministry of Education to promptly resolve various issues and decided to directly write to the Executive Yuan for relief. According to the person in charge of the Association, if an effective response is not received in the short term, they will petition in Beijing again.

### The Growing China New Academy: An Ideal School of Journalism

— Shengjie

Otto von Bismarck, the Iron Chancellor, said, "To save the peace of Europe, we must hang a dozen journalists." Kaiser Wilhelm II also said, "Though I have a million soldiers, I lack a single Times." From these two sentences, we can understand the power and importance of journalism. However, the history of journalism is only about thirty years old. The world-renowned Missouri School of Journalism was founded in 1908, and the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism held its groundbreaking ceremony in 1913. Therefore, journalism is still a very young science. Speaking of journalism education in our country, it is lamentable that, apart from Yanjing and Fudan, almost no school has established a journalism department. Recently, National Central University (Zhengda) has also formally added a journalism department. However, relying on the graduates of these two or three university journalism departments is simply not enough to meet the future development and promotion of journalism. At the same time, eight years of bloody experience tells us that every major and minor battle's news reports rely on journalists, and these talents cannot be cultivated hastily during wartime. Today, we have won victory and are embarking on the road to national reconstruction. Due to past lessons and present needs, China must have a large school of journalism to train journalistic cadres. But the reality is not ideal; the difficulty of material conditions, the lack of talent, the backwardness of education... and other objective environmental constraints! As we waited and waited in disappointment, a faint glimmer of dawn suddenly appeared in the dark corner. A newly established school of journalism was born with the needs of this new era. That is the China New Academy of Journalism that is growing today.

President Chen Gaoyong, formerly a professor at Fudan University and one of China's top ten famous professors, with the forthright spirit of a northerner, united some friends in the journalism community and gained the support of people in the education and cultural circles, arduously supporting a heavy burden, determined to establish an ideal school of journalism in China.

The "New Academy" professors are all famous reporters in Shanghai. Zhu Xubai, director of the Municipal Government Information Office, teaches Reporting; Qian Nashui, chief editor of the Frontline Daily, teaches Editing; Lu Mang, deputy director of the Information Office of the Third Front Army, teaches Current Affairs Analysis; Cheng Zhongwen, director of the Shanghai office of the Wuhan Daily, teaches Editorial Writing; Zhang Yaoxiang, director of the Education Department of Jinan University, teaches Social Psychology; Sun Guiding, professor at Jinan University, teaches English Translation; Wang Qixi, deputy editor of Shen Bao, and Bu Shaofu and Chu Yukun, columnists, share the responsibility of teaching Reporting, Periodical Editing, and Introduction to Journalism. Other professors are also well-known figures in the domestic journalism community.

The school was founded with the victory of the War of Resistance, and it has been a year since then. Two sessions of the Research Department have concluded, with nearly four hundred graduates. Although not all of them are engaged in journalism, most of them are already working in newspapers. They are scattered in various large and small newspapers in the five provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Anhui, and Fujian, serving as field reporters and editors in no less than a hundred people. There are also many others working in various news agencies. Although these newly graduated journalistic warriors are just greenhorns, their spirit, work ethic, and enthusiasm have indeed won the praise of their journalistic seniors. For example, Cai Yibiao, a graduate of the first class, is now a reporter for the Central News Agency. He was praised by Mr. Feng Youzhen for obtaining a piece of news and was immediately promoted from a trainee reporter to a full reporter. This may be due to his youth, but the influence of the school's basic education cannot be ignored.

Currently, the school has a total of four classes: one upper-level class (divided into three groups: A, B, and C), one lower-level class, two upper-level classes, and three classes in total for the undergraduate program, and one class (divided into two groups: A and B) for the research program. The entire school has about four hundred students, with males accounting for four-fifths and females accounting for one-fifth. Undergraduate classes are held during the day, and research classes are held in the evening. The academic level of the students varies. Most of the undergraduate students are high school graduates, with a few having attended university or working and studying at two schools concurrently. The research students are all sophomores or graduates of universities. Many are already working in various fields, mostly reporters and editors from various newspapers, followed by doctors, lawyers, middle school teachers, actors, and demobilized youth soldiers. Outsiders who hear about their diverse backgrounds may feel that the quality is uneven and that it affects the school's atmosphere. In fact, a person engaged in journalism should know everything and encompass everything. Having so many different types of people together is a good opportunity to connect with people from all walks of life in future work. This is also what distinguishes it from other schools.

The youngest student is only sixteen years old, and the oldest is no more than thirty years old. Judging from their age, these students are still young. Therefore, in addition to attending classes, they are very active in their spare time, such as putting up wall newspapers, performing plays, and organizing sports teams. At the same time, in order to encourage students to increase their interest in academic research, the school has also held English and Chinese speech contests and literary competitions. The students in each class competed to be the first to participate, eager to determine who would win. Their lively and innocent expressions symbolize optimism about the future development of China's journalism.

In addition to regular courses, they also have extracurricular assignments, such as literary exercises, special interviews, Chinese-English translation, and current affairs commentaries. These supplement the deficiencies of the regular courses. In addition, there is a small library. Although the scale is not large, it is enough for students to regularly use as spiritual food and reference materials. Whenever the end-of-class bell rings or the start-of-class bell has not yet rung, they swarm there, all with a sense of fear, desperately seizing time, fearing to waste those five or ten minutes.

Their school building, it's funny to say, is not as big as the area of ​​a large ballroom or cinema. In just this small place, you would never imagine that there would be hundreds of young men and women studying diligently.

In the quiet and secluded southern section of Avenue Albert, on a smooth asphalt road, opposite the Yiyuan, a sacred place for musical performances in Shanghai, in the southeast corner of the Chinese-French Pharmaceutical College campus, in a ochre, semi-Western-style bungalow, we must not ignore the fact that a large group of future news warriors are growing there. They are the pioneers who will inherit and develop the new Chinese journalism.

### Ten Major Uses of Budget Statements

— Wen

At the start of each year, budget formulation can be said to be quantitatively important work because a carefully prepared budget statement has the following benefits:

(1) It can make the use of working capital most economical, that is, to generate the greatest work efficiency with the most economical working capital.

(2) Because it is jointly drafted by the heads of each department, unnecessary losses and waste can be avoided.

(3) The responsibilities of each part are clear. For example, if the manufacturing cost in the budget statement is a certain amount, and the actual manufacturing exceeds the budget, the reason can be investigated.

(4) A detailed budget statement can enable each department to cooperate closely.

(5) Each point listed in a budget statement can be clear to the heads of departments at a glance. Any overuse of funds in a certain department can be detected immediately.

(6) With a budget, it can be compared with the final accounts, which can also show how visionary the head of the department is.

(7) Budget statements can help heads of departments assess whether sales, manufacturing, and economic scheduling policies are reasonable.

(8) A head of department with a budget must constantly check market conditions, so he can plan necessary expansions in various undertakings.

(9) With a budget statement, heads of departments must strive to save on raw materials, labor, and other expenses in order to meet the budget.

(10) With a budget statement, there can be a basis for implementing it in future years. According to the current situation, because the situation is constantly changing, the budget period should not be too long and can be set for three or six months.

### Tomorrow's Producers: Automated Factories

— Translated by Chen Xiang

Imagine a clean and spacious factory, with no one working on the floor, only nine technicians pacing on the upper platform, paying attention to the control machines. Raw materials are transported in by conveyor, and after passing through a series of machines, finished and packaged products are released: radios, refrigerators, fountain pens, tractors, or anything else you want to produce.

This factory of tomorrow differs from today's factories as much as a hydroelectric plant differs from an old-fashioned steam power plant using a row of boilers and people adding coal.

In modern times, people are less useful on the factory floor than anywhere else. We already have machines that see more clearly than the eye, calculate more reliably than the brain, record more accurately than memory, and work faster and better than hands. These devices never feel hungry or tired. They can do anything a worker can do, and do it quickly, well, and continuously.

Wartime Labor Shortages Spawned This System

The wartime "continuous-flow system" made the production of chemicals, kerosene, rubber, and atomic bomb materials completely automatic.

A completely automated factory needs three basic representations of mechanical units: these all exist today. First, there must be devices for sending and receiving announcements. We already have many of these. For example, we use photoelectric cells for proofreading; microphones and vibration meters find pressure differences; and there are electronic tube computers with almost unbelievable computational precision.

The second type of basic mechanical unit is an electronic device that can accept announcements and transmit them one by one to control the machinery for correctly manufacturing items. This equipment is now widely used.

The third type of basic mechanical unit is responsible for the real manufacturing work. Their applications are extensive, taking on the work of cutting, shaping, assembling, and painting artificial objects.

In many cases, industry uses automated machines for various specialized tasks. The author suggests linking some of these machines together into a group to produce and coordinate a complete product. This complete production machine will be extremely useful, and its components can be easily rearranged to create a completely different effect.

Robots Engage in Production

For more diverse applications of automated production, we recommend what we call "arm machines". Basically, it is composed of an articulated arm embedded in a turntable. The free end is equipped with a specially gripped fixture: a gripping pawl, vise, or magnet, depending on the nature of the work. At the bottom, the mechanical structure allows the arm to rotate and bend on the pivot and move the holding fixture. This machine can move like a worker's arm, and the hand itself can rotate at the wrist. Its model has already been made.

Suppose we want to make a part, say a copper ring with internal threads to hold the microphone of a telephone receiver. The work procedure is recorded on a perforated roll of paper, using the holes on the paper to communicate to the "working machine": raw copper tubing must be made into copper rings. A communication unit translates the meaning expressed by the paper holes into electrical impulses, which are transmitted to the "arm" and "manufacturing machine". During the manufacturing process, the paper holes can direct the change of tools on the holding fixture. The made copper rings pass through an inspection machine on a conveyor belt, and any defects are discarded, otherwise, they are conveyed out.

An automated factory is composed of many production mechanical units. As described earlier, each unit forms a simple part, which is combined by a central control panel.

An organization that fully utilizes this type of automated machinery will be very different from the present and will create a new industrial order. Producing twenty-four hours a day, the factory will provide large quantities of cheap goods. The quality of the goods will also be better because the machines work more precisely during manufacturing.

The alterability of the basic mechanical units makes the manufacturer unafraid of sudden changes in the market. If different kinds of products are to be manufactured, there are instructions on the control machine, and the technician can rearrange the production units and then the continuous work can begin again.

This alterability speeds up the introduction of new products. In today's factories, to implement new plans, manufacturers must dismantle most of their machinery, which is extremely uneconomical in terms of time and money.

A New Industrial Revolution Will Enrich the Common People

During the war, industry created more fundamental new products in three years than in the past thirty years. Unless we establish a system of mechanical production suitable for change, we cannot quickly obtain truly new cars, trains, refrigerators, and houses.

Automated factories may cause temporary waves of unemployment. But the huge benefits are unparalleled. Managing machines is always better than managing people. In the end, this new machinery only has value with mass employment and a mass market. The development of automated production requires highly skilled technicians and managers. Using training programs, shorter work cycles, and other strategies can stabilize the transitional shock.

The latent awareness of the automated production system makes the ideal of working two or three days a week achievable. Its low cost can give workers higher wages and also have greater value for consumers. Therefore, the standard of living for human beings must be higher than it is now. The new machines can forever liberate workers from tedious, monotonous labor.

The American "Constitution" is one of the oldest warships in that country and is currently under repair and will continue to serve.

(IV) After Employment

After employing workers, an enterprise organization ultimately hopes they can work with peace of mind and obtain opportunities for advancement. Therefore, several things should be noted. The first point is attendance. The personnel department should maintain attendance records. Factories commonly use wooden plaques, collecting the plaques when workers start and hanging them up, or use a sign-in method. The most advanced method is using a time clock. Every worker must punch in and out on a card at the start and end of work. Before the end of the month, these are submitted to the personnel department to check for lateness or early departures. Within the personnel department, it is best to have a form for each employee, with the following format: Number, Name, Date, 1 2 3 4 5, January, February, March, Total Working Days, Days Absent, Percentage of Attendance.

In the squares, any instances of lateness, early departure, or leave should be marked in red. For example, AS represents sick leave, AN represents unexcused absence, ES represents early departure due to illness, EN represents unexcused early departure, etc. Because every employee should submit a leave application form when taking leave, have it signed by the work department, and then forward it to the personnel department for recording. Generally, enterprise organizations have rules stipulating that those who have not taken any leave during the year receive a corresponding reward, such as a one-month salary bonus. There are also disciplinary regulations, such as deducting salary, for those with excessive absences. The second point to consider is salary and living conditions. From the perspective of the enterprise organization, of course, they hope to employ workers at the lowest cost because low wages mean lower expenses and lighter costs. However, they should also consider the workers' needs. They cannot disregard the standard of living in order to save expenses. Therefore, when the standard of living rises, salaries should be automatically increased to allow workers to work with peace of mind. It is also very important to ensure that employees work for a long time after they are initially hired. Many enterprise organizations stipulate that employees who have worked for ten years receive a certain bonus, and those who have worked for twenty-five years receive a certain bonus.

The third point to consider is the issue of promotions and transfers. Everyone has a desire to move up. No one wants to do low-level work forever. Therefore, when an employee is diligent or has made special contributions, they should be given monetary or grade-level rewards. When promoting or transferring employees, this will affect the records kept by the personnel department. Therefore, the responsible work department should send a notification form to the personnel department so that the personnel department can make changes to the records.

### 四川的山　　桐窗雜憶之一
The Mountains of Sichuan – Miscellaneous Memories from Tongchuang, Part 1

— 葉鼎洛
— Ye Dingluo

常聽人說，「桂林山水甲天下」，我一直憧憬着廣西的山水，但直到現在沒有能夠去遊歷。有些朋友說，桂林山水這奇特，不過都是平地上聳立起來的石筍，形狀突元，所以出奇，如果當作畫面似的風景看，就乏味了。我是特別喜歡風景的一個人，所以，我前常喜歡「野外寫生」，近來常畫中國畫，也喜作山水。曾經，小時候看過許多山水古畫，使我悠然神往，想住在叢山峻嶺之中，聽着松壽，望着流水，是多麽幽靜的生活。這當然是一種想像，但我却從不懷疑，畫面上那樣的山水，並非眞實境界。這次，從西北到四川來，在路上，看見那些山水，格外相信，那些前人的名作，並非虛構了。誰說中國畫歷現實太遠呢？限於一條長條子的格式，而在那上面構出畫來，中國山水畫有這一種特長。四川這一帶的山水，最宜乎這樣的佈局。這可以證明中國從前的畫家，大都取材於自然界，並非依據成法，在紙上捏造天地，而一個畫家的遊歷名山大川，是最必要的修養。寫史記的司馬遷，幾乎遊遍了漢朝中國的本部，所以他的文章浩肆旁礴，為古文的宗師，那末，畫家中的關仝，馬遠之輩，又何嘗不是履行家。實在，四川這一帶的山，太使我戀戀不捨了，長松，翠柏，高峰，峻嶺，叢巒，壘崗，亂石，怪樹，瀑布，靑溪，白雲，朝霧，竹林，村舍，急流，狂喘，幽禽，野鳥，充塞在這一帶的山間，人在這裏而走，「如行在圖畫之中」，眞有這種情形。

I often hear people say, "Guilin's scenery is the best in the world." I have always longed to visit the scenery of Guangxi, but I have not been able to travel there until now. Some friends say that the peculiarity of Guilin's scenery is that it is just stone bamboo shoots rising from the ground, with abrupt shapes, so it is surprising. If you look at it as a picture-like landscape, it is dull. I am a person who especially likes scenery. Therefore, I used to often like "plein air sketching," and recently I often paint Chinese paintings, and also like to create landscapes. I once saw many ancient landscape paintings when I was a child, which made me yearn for them. I wanted to live in the midst of mountains and ridges, listening to the pines and watching the flowing water, what a quiet life. This is of course an imagination, but I never doubted that the landscape in the paintings was not a real realm. This time, coming to Sichuan from the Northwest, on the road, seeing those landscapes, I especially believed that those famous works of the predecessors were not fictional. Who says that Chinese painting is too far from reality? Limited to the format of a long strip, and constructing a painting on it, Chinese landscape painting has this kind of special skill. The landscape of Sichuan is most suitable for such a layout. This proves that ancient Chinese painters mostly drew materials from nature, rather than creating the world on paper based on established methods. A painter's travel to famous mountains and rivers is the most necessary cultivation. Sima Qian, who wrote the Historical Records, almost traveled all over the mainland of the Han Dynasty, so his articles were vast and majestic, and he was the master of ancient prose. Then, the painters Guan Tong and Ma Yuan were not practitioners either. Indeed, the mountains in Sichuan make me so reluctant to leave. Tall pines, green cypresses, high peaks, steep ridges, clusters of peaks, stacked hills, chaotic rocks, strange trees, waterfalls, green streams, white clouds, morning mist, bamboo forests, villages, rushing streams, violent gasps, secluded birds, wild birds, fill the mountains in this area. Walking here, "as if walking in a picture," this is really the case.

我做夢也沒有想到四川來，感悟日本人，把我從西北逼到這裏，看到這許多山水，是我莫大的收穫，我沒有到過四川的全部，相信，在我走過的地區外，還有更好的山水，從地圖上看起來，中國的山脈，原來擠在西南這一帶。世界上山脈的聚結處，也在歐亞交界的地方。當初地球發冷的時候，特別在這一帶凝結起許多皺紋和　瘤，成了我們愛看的許多風景，而中國的版圖，也切到了這幽靜的一部，使我在本國的土地上，尋覓出許多畫材，這實在是一種幸福。

I never dreamed of coming to Sichuan. I am grateful to the Japanese for forcing me from the Northwest to here. Seeing so much scenery is my greatest gain. I have not been to all of Sichuan. I believe that there is better scenery outside the areas I have traveled. Looking at the map, China's mountains are originally crowded in the southwest. The gathering place of the world's mountains is also at the junction of Europe and Asia. When the earth cooled down in the beginning, many wrinkles and tumors condensed in this area, becoming many landscapes that we love to see, and the Chinese territory also cut to this quiet part, allowing me to find many painting materials in my own country, which is really a kind of happiness.

### 新年
New Year's Day

— 耶草
— Yecao

砲聲沉寂幾天了。
The sound of gunfire has been silent for several days.

火綫像是轉移到別的地方去，然而，火綱內的駱家村還是只有駱老頭自己。這是一位硬朗而又倔強的老漢，他十八歲時因為和家裏淘氣，在軍隊裏一混便是十幾年，他的足跡踏遍了西北與江南。張勳復辟一役，左手掛了彩，他回家來了。他改穿舊衣，重新荷起農具，安份的度着傳統的耕者生活。每在秋收無事，天寒夜長時，他格外受村鄰的愛戴；那間牛屋—他的臥房，中間有一團熊熊的火光，周圍擠滿了靑年人，孩子們，靜靜的，在辟拍的火聲中，傾聽他述說十幾年離奇古怪的遭逢。

The front line seems to have shifted to another place, but in Luojia Village within the fire zone, there is still only old man Luo himself. This is a tough and stubborn old man. When he was eighteen years old, he was naughty with his family, and he spent more than ten years in the army, his footprints all over the Northwest and Jiangnan. In the Zhang Xun restoration campaign, his left hand was injured, and he returned home. He changed into old clothes, picked up farming tools again, and lived a traditional farming life in peace. Every time after the autumn harvest, when there was nothing to do, when the weather was cold and the nights were long, he was especially loved by his neighbors; in that cowshed—his bedroom—there was a blazing fire in the middle, surrounded by young people and children, quietly listening to him tell about his bizarre experiences over the past ten years amidst the crackling sound of the fire.

「看吧，我們終歸會勝的。」
"Look, we will eventually win."

憑他的經騐他有充分的自信力，他的話總是肯定的。勝利果然到臨了，他買些香燭紙砲，敬天地，拜祖先，欣歡欲狂。但，半年後駱家村又打起仗來，這是他想像不到的！他大兒子當兵至今未回家，小兒子又給編組了去。駱家村在火綱內，什麼全給打得稀爛；山上駐了兵，無法進去，祇得呌老伴帶着媳婦孫兒到沒戰爭的地方去人。那老嫗經不起風霜饑餓，一月之後便死在路上。駱老頭得到這消息，他鬆下口裏的旱烟袋，垂着頭，輕輕太息一下：

Based on his experience, he had full confidence, and his words were always affirmative. Victory did come, and he bought some incense candles and paper firecrackers, respected the heavens and the earth, worshipped his ancestors, and was overjoyed. But, half a year later, Luojia Village started fighting again, which he couldn't imagine! His eldest son had been in the army and had not returned home, and his youngest son had been enlisted again. Luojia Village was in the fire zone, and everything was completely destroyed; soldiers were stationed on the mountain, so they couldn't go in, so they had to tell the old wife to take the daughter-in-law and grandchildren to a place where there was no war. The old woman couldn't stand the wind, frost, hunger, and starvation, and died on the road a month later. When old man Luo got the news, he loosened the dry tobacco pouch in his mouth, lowered his head, and sighed softly:

「世道變了！」
"The world has changed!"

中然心酸一陣，但他並不失望，他想：六十年一個甲子，變亂總有平復的時候。他活着依然很在勁兒。這村上固然只剩他一個人，他還是勤勤快快的過日子，他們可憐的幾畝地，都用手播種上小麥，已是綠油油的一片。其餘的—那廣大的地面全荒廢着迪倒使他感到無限的心傷。

He was saddened for a while, but he was not disappointed. He thought: sixty years is a cycle, and the chaos will always be calmed down. He is still very energetic in his life. Although he is the only one left in this village, he still lives diligently, and their poor few acres of land are all sown with wheat by hand, and it is already a green field. The rest—the vast area is completely deserted, which makes him feel infinitely heartbroken.

「唏！」
"Hee!"

他噓了一聲，旱烟袋又塞進嘴裏。
He hissed, and the dry tobacco pouch was stuffed back into his mouth.

這天陽光很好，風沙小，室外不大冷，駱老頭像平素的晴天一樣，安閒的坐在門外石滾上取　。經騐告訴他，今天正是大年初一，他立刻站起來，將他噓了一聲，旱烟袋堅在石滾旁，握起破掃帶，把兩間歪斜的屋子掃得乾乾淨淨，又掃了一掃院子；洗過手臉，對着房內後牆上那張陳舊的「駱氏三代之神位」的葒紙簽恭敬的磕了三個頭，然後拍拍膝前的灰　，出了門，提着旱烟袋，蹲在門檻抽起來。

The sun was very good that day, the wind and sand were small, and it was not very cold outside. Old man Luo, like on a normal sunny day, sat leisurely on the stone roller outside the door to get warm. Experience told him that today was the first day of the lunar new year, and he immediately stood up, hissed, placed the dry tobacco pouch next to the stone roller, grabbed the broken broom, swept the two crooked houses clean, and swept the yard again; washed his hands and face, and respectfully kowtowed three times to the old red paper sign of "The Spiritual Tablet of the Luo Family's Three Generations" on the back wall of the room, then patted the dust in front of his knees, went out the door, carried the dry tobacco pouch, and squatted on the threshold to smoke.

「我也算過了年了。」他自言自語着。
"I have also celebrated the new year." He said to himself.

抽着烟，駱老頭展眼向郊外瞭望着，從村莊到村莊，房子，祇剩下一些傾圮的帶烟熏的山牆；樹木焦爛的立在地上，沒有人畜，聽不到犬吠鷄鳴，看不見一縷炊烟，無邊的灰黃色，極目蒼閔！轉眼看看駱家村，一樣的，什麼也沒有：他的屋子還是三個月前自己用樹枝亂草搭起來的。往年鬼子橫行時，兵一退大家全搬了回來，理墻蓋屋怪有心勁，現在呢，人一去更不回來了！這裏簡直成了荒草湖坡。他不懂這是什麼意思？為什麼破壞得比敵人佔領期間還厲害！人逃光了，地荒着，大家都沒有糧食喫！…………

Smoking, old man Luo looked out at the countryside, from village to village, the houses, only some dilapidated gables with smoke stains remained; the trees stood charred on the ground, there were no people or animals, he couldn't hear dogs barking or chickens crowing, he couldn't see a wisp of smoke, the boundless gray-yellow color was desolate! Looking back at Luojia Village, it was the same, nothing was there: his house was still built by himself three months ago with branches and weeds. In the past, when the Japanese devils were rampant, everyone moved back as soon as the soldiers withdrew, and they were strangely motivated to repair the walls and build the houses. Now, people have left and never come back! This place has simply become a deserted grassy lake slope. He didn't understand what this meant? Why was the destruction more severe than during the enemy's occupation! People have all fled, the land is barren, and everyone has no food to eat! …………

「我不懂！」
"I don't understand!"

從前鬼子呌他們修路，每回全村最多去上三二十人，敷衍敷衍。等到晚上，國軍破路的命令到達，沒老沒少，不分男女，扛起傢伙一窩蜂樣的全湧去扒路，天剛亮，大夥又一起喜皮笑臉的跑回家。這會兒世道變了，人都給攪擾得逃光了！……反正他十年八年不會死，到底怎麼一回事他還可以看得見。他希望着，希望總有一天駱家村能夠恢復原狀。

In the past, when the Japanese devils told them to repair the road, at most thirty or twenty people from the whole village went to do it each time, just going through the motions. When the order from the national army to destroy the road arrived in the evening, young and old, regardless of men and women, carried their tools and rushed to dig up the road like a swarm of bees. At dawn, everyone ran home together with happy faces. Now the world has changed, and everyone has been disturbed and fled! … Anyway, he won't die in ten or eight years, and he can still see what's going on. He hoped, hoping that one day Luojia Village could return to its original state.

遠遠的，有一個藍色的人影移動着，駱老頭吃力的望着，他不大信任自已的眼睛，這地方會有誰來？待走近時，他看到那個穿着不相稱的藍棉袍的是他的大兒子，背着一個包袱，老遠的就喊：
In the distance, there was a blue figure moving. Old man Luo strained his eyes to look. He didn't quite trust his own eyes. Who would come to this place? When he got closer, he saw that the person wearing an ill-fitting blue cotton robe was his eldest son, carrying a bundle on his back, shouting from a distance:

「爸爸，爸爸！」
"Dad, Dad!"

老人輕輕的答應一聲，對於兒子的歸來，他並不感十分興趣；他希望的是全村親鄰都能回來。一見面兒子便問道：
The old man responded softly. He was not very interested in his son's return; he hoped that all the relatives and neighbors in the village could return. As soon as they met, the son asked:

「他們呢？」
"Where are they?"

「回頭再說。」
"We'll talk about it later."

兒子取出包裹裏的麵粉，豬肉和一瓶高梁酒，放在門後；父子兩人開始談起來，駱老頭先說到兒子離家後村上的情形。接着，大兒子說他已經正式升了班長，因為離家近，連長特許回家看看。他父親問他目前為什麼還在打仗，他回簽不出所以然來。談了半晌，駱老頭沒得到一點自己希望的事物；他轉了話題，要求大兒陪他做飯。

The son took out the flour, pork, and a bottle of sorghum wine from the package and placed them behind the door; the father and son began to talk. Old man Luo first talked about the situation in the village after his son left home. Then, the eldest son said that he had been officially promoted to squad leader, and because he was close to home, the company commander allowed him to come home to see. His father asked him why they were still fighting now, and he couldn't answer the reason. After talking for a long time, old man Luo didn't get any of the things he hoped for; he changed the subject and asked his eldest son to accompany him to cook.

飯剛做好，小兒子也化了裝加到家。他帶了一些食鹽和兩條土造烟。父子三人坐在一起，吃着飯，他們唱完那一瓶高梁酒，小兒子如同對部下一般的，誇張的講着他們的日常生活，起初駱老頭聽得有趣味，及至小兒子一再重複說着，老人臉色漸漸現出一層厭煩，他不怏意的說：
The meal was just cooked when the youngest son also came home in disguise. He brought some salt and two homemade cigarettes. The father and three sons sat together, eating, they finished that bottle of sorghum wine, and the youngest son, as if to his subordinates, exaggeratedly talked about their daily life. At first, old man Luo listened with interest, but as the youngest son repeatedly said it, the old man's face gradually showed a layer of boredom, and he said unhappily:

「虧你生張好嘴巴！」
"What a glib tongue you have!"

「什麼？……」
"What? …"

小兒子想還嘴，但祇說一聲什麼便住口了。駱老頭看看兩個兒子的眼臉；想到被澈底破壞了的村莊，荒廢的土地，餐風宿露逃難在外的親鄰；想到兄弟二人在第一綫，一個娘生的，同是他的兒子，却互相殘殺，針鋒相對，他不禁有些感嘆了：

The youngest son wanted to retort, but only said something and stopped. Old man Luo looked at the faces of his two sons; thinking of the thoroughly destroyed village, the barren land, the relatives and neighbors who were eating and sleeping in the open air and fleeing; thinking of the two brothers on the front line, born of the same mother, both his sons, but killing each other, facing each other tit-for-tat, he couldn't help but sigh:

「好內銷們都回來了，咱們好好的過這個年，以後誰也不許再出門了！」
"Good internal consumers have all returned, let's have a good new year, and no one is allowed to go out again in the future!"

老人說着走出房門，他腦海裏閃過一個可喜的遐想。小兒子朝着老人的背影說：
The old man said as he walked out of the room, a gratifying reverie flashed in his mind. The youngest son said to the old man's back:

「老頑固！」
"Old stubborn!"

「拍」
"Slap"

大兒子有些看不過去，他忍不住，狠狠的在他弟弟的腦袋上扔一巴掌；那弟弟暴跳起來，指着他的哥哥：
The eldest son couldn't stand it anymore, he couldn't help but slap his younger brother hard on the head; the younger brother jumped up and pointed at his brother:

「奴才，你以為我不敢和你鬥爭嗎？」
"Lackey, do you think I don't dare to fight you?"

「混蛋！」
"Bastard!"

於是兄弟兩人扭成一團，邊打邊駡，駱老頭一脚踏進房門，摸摸鬍鬚，嚴厲的高聲嚷着：

So the two brothers twisted into a ball, fighting and scolding, old man Luo stepped into the door, stroked his beard, and shouted sternly:

「不要打，都跪下來！跪在祖先面前，平心靜氣想一想啊！……看看咱們的村莊，咱們的土地；想想咱們的親鄰吧！……再打，連自們這破陋的屋子也保不住了！……」
"Don't fight, kneel down! Kneel in front of the ancestors, think calmly! … Look at our village, our land; think about our relatives and neighbors! … If you fight again, we won't even be able to keep this broken house! …"

### 茅屋
Thatched Cottage

— 華風
— Hua Feng

在這個荒涼的山谷裏，茅屋沉默地蹲在陡峭的山坡上，迎着太陽從峯頂昇起又落下，迎着每一個苦寒的風雨吹打的日子。
In this desolate valley, the thatched cottage silently squats on the steep hillside, facing the sun rising and falling from the peak, facing every day of bitter cold wind and rain.

當春天姍姍地從山外翻越過來時，給予茅屋以最大喜悅的該是那條淙淙地唱着歌　從它脚下穿過的溪流了。秧歌，收歌，布榖島的啼喚應和着溪流日夜的狂嘯，一串洪亮的靑春底蠱惑的天籟便蕩漾在山谷裏。
When spring slowly rolls over from outside the mountain, what should give the thatched cottage the greatest joy is the stream that sings and flows under its feet. The yangko song, the harvest song, and the cries of the cuckoo echo the stream's roaring day and night, and a string of loud, youthful, bewitching celestial music ripples in the valley.

是屬於遠祖的年代了，茅屋曾經過有一個光輝的蠍子那時它底主人擁有衆多的牲口，廣大的耕地，驚人的勞力和無數的農具，種籽，肥料………那時日子是熱鬧而忙碌的。
It belongs to the age of distant ancestors. The thatched cottage once had a glorious scorpion. At that time, its master had many livestock, vast cultivated land, amazing labor force, and countless farming tools, seeds, and fertilizers... At that time, life was lively and busy.

白天，它靜靜地躺在柔和的陽光下做着夢。晚上，當它底主人一個個從田野歸來時，它底寬暢的心上便洋溢着生命底歡呼。大家圍在一蓋森藍的油燈下檢討一天工作的成績，而牛犢們便在矮的茅棚低聲地澌炓着，山谷的夜雖然幽靜，但茅屋是不會感到寂寞的。
During the day, it quietly lies in the soft sunlight, dreaming. At night, when its masters return from the fields one by one, its spacious heart is filled with the cheers of life. Everyone gathers around a Gersaint blue oil lamp to review the results of the day's work, while the calves are quietly eating grass in the low shed. Although the night in the valley is quiet, the thatched cottage will not feel lonely.

現在，春耕的季節雖然來臨，而屋却沒有音日那樣餘款了。因為它知道自己底主人已失去了所有的牲口農具和種籽。………望着那一片荒蕪的耕地，它簌簌地滴下悒　的眼淚。
Now, although the spring plowing season has arrived, the house does not have as much balance as on the day of the sound. Because it knows that its master has lost all the livestock, farming tools, and seeds. … Looking at the desolate cultivated land, it dripped sad tears.

### 白畫像

方棣克（Van　Dyck1590－1641）是魯班斯最得意的珍上門人。十九歲就享了盛名，英王Cha．les．L，奉師命辦去英王，漫遊意大利，埋頭研究古代人家；又五年，果大成。三十三歲再應英王聘，為宮廷畫師，賜建皇宮式之畫室於台姆司河畔，製作甚多，代表有「耶穌下葬」，「英王祁爾斯　一世騎馬像」，「聖百代樂受難」等。此為二十歲之自畫像，至今仍在，可謂難得。（獅）
Van Dyck (1590-1641) was Rubens' most proud and treasured disciple. He enjoyed great fame at the age of nineteen. King Charles I of England, ordered by his master, went to the English King, traveled in Italy, and immersed himself in the study of ancient people; after another five years, he achieved great success. At the age of thirty-three, he was again hired by the King of England as a court painter, and was granted a palace-style studio on the banks of the Thames River. He produced many works, including "The Entombment of Christ", "Equestrian Portrait of Charles I", "The Martyrdom of Saint Bartholomew", etc. This is a self-portrait at the age of twenty, which still exists today, which is very rare.

### 漫談舞獅
A Casual Discussion on Lion Dance

— 老丹
— Lao Dan

每逢夏曆歲首，或是其他的紀念節期，廣東本地和粵僑所在的地方，多有「舞獅」的娛樂，舞獅固可以表示團結，又可以振刷精神，鼓樂的節奏有序，更令人們精神渙發。
Every Lunar New Year, or other commemorative festivals, in Guangdong and in places where Cantonese overseas Chinese reside, there is often the entertainment of "lion dance." Lion dance can express unity, can boost morale, and the rhythmic drum music is orderly, making people more energetic.

舞獅的起源，無書可徴，有說是圖騰的遺跡，也有說是太古落時期出搬獲得勝利品的表示，是否屬實，無可稽考了。舞獅的組織，是由各鄉的祠堂，或武館，街坊等而來。在上海呢，多屬武館，如由什麼社什麼堂做基礎的。獅頭的構造，是用竹片紮輪廓，用紙糊成，塗油彩色，裝毛嵌鏡，耳眼口舌，都能活動。獅身用彩綢製成，尾裝長毛．獅的鬚眉，多屬白色，表示老獅。若果黑鬚黑眉，便是壯年獅中，出外遊行，便常遭遇到好事的鬥爭。所以獅子的鬍眉多用白，就是這個原故。但是有些鄕村或武館，自恃人多勢大，軍器充足，而用黑色眉鬚的獅子，到處挑皺的也有，不過別的獅子聞着它的行跡，住往閃進，不敢正面相偶，恐怕招川死非來，因為以前舞獅的常常借故尋仇鬧事，有時因為舞獅而弄到械鬥，但是這些陋習，近年來減少了。
The origin of lion dance cannot be verified from books. Some say it is a relic of totemism, and some say it is a sign of obtaining victory products from primitive times. Whether it is true or not cannot be verified. The organization of lion dance comes from ancestral halls, martial arts halls, neighborhoods, etc. in various villages. In Shanghai, it mostly belongs to martial arts halls, such as those based on certain societies or halls. The structure of the lion's head is made of bamboo strips tied into an outline, pasted with paper, painted with oil colors, decorated with hair and inlaid with mirrors, and the ears, eyes, mouth, and tongue can all move. The lion's body is made of colored silk, and the tail is decorated with long hair. The lion's whiskers and eyebrows are mostly white, indicating an old lion. If the whiskers and eyebrows are black, it is a middle-aged lion. When traveling outside, it often encounters struggles from good people. Therefore, the lion's whiskers and eyebrows are mostly white for this reason. However, some villages or martial arts halls, relying on their large population and sufficient military equipment, also use lions with black eyebrows and whiskers to provoke disputes everywhere. However, other lions, smelling its tracks, usually flash in, not daring to meet it head-on, for fear of attracting death. Because in the past, lion dancers often used to seek revenge and cause trouble, sometimes leading to fights because of lion dance, but these bad habits have decreased in recent years.

舞腳是有他的技術·舞獅頭的循着鑼戲的節拍而動作，進退高低，左右蹲跳種種神態，舞獅尾的也同一動作，這非有嫺熟的武技，不能夠活動自如，動人視聽。
Dancing feet has its own skills. The lion's head dancer moves according to the rhythm of the gong opera, advancing and retreating, rising and falling, squatting and jumping left and right, and the lion's tail dancer does the same. Without skilled martial arts skills, it is impossible to move freely and be moving to the audience.

每一個獅子，配合的人，最要緊的舞獅頭，必有三四個人輪流換班，其次舞獅尾和準備採靑，上樓台等助手，一個戴着假面具手搖蒲扇作先導的，引人發笑。他如鼓手，鈸手，握手主持樂其。還有許多武士裝束，帶了刀槍，旗幟，錦標，籐盾等，旣助威勢，也是準備萬一的廝殺。說好一點的，是儀仗的配襯，下然，過於單調了。
For each lion, the most important thing is the people who cooperate. The lion's head dancer must have three or four people take turns. Secondly, there are assistants such as the lion's tail dancer and those who prepare to pick green vegetables, climb the stage, etc. A person wearing a mask and shaking a cattail fan leads the way, making people laugh. There are also drummers, cymbal players, and those who shake hands to host the music. There are also many samurai costumes, with knives, guns, flags, trophies, rattan shields, etc., which both help to increase the momentum and prepare for a possible fight. To put it nicely, it is the embellishment of the guard of honor, but of course it is too monotonous.

獅子採靑，是最精彩的表演，在數丈高掛着生菜或其他錦標現款等，舞獅的在鼓樂喧鬧解中，依着法式，踏在竹竿上或人的膊上，或藤盾上，一層一層的上去，表演稱種動作，把兩眼拿着，跳下來在地上慢慢地齧吞，這種工夫，是要經過相常訓練的．一個獅頭有數十斤重，舞獅的旣要把它舞弄，又要使它的口開闊，跳躍護退，或遠或臥，或急或慢，一氣呵成，而不換班。所以舞獅是合作的表示，團結的象徽，如果彼此閒失了聯緊，那就黯然無色，沒精打彩的了。
The lion picking green vegetables is the most exciting performance. Raw vegetables or other trophies and cash are hung several feet high. In the midst of the noisy drum music, the lion dancers, according to the style, step on bamboo poles or people's shoulders, or rattan shields, layer by layer, performing various actions, holding the two eyes, jumping down and slowly gnawing and swallowing on the ground. This kind of skill requires considerable training. A lion's head weighs dozens of pounds. The lion dancer must not only dance with it, but also make its mouth open wide, jump and retreat, far or lying down, fast or slow, all in one go, without changing shifts. Therefore, lion dance is a symbol of cooperation and unity. If the connection between each other is lost, it will be dull and lackluster.

人們都在忙着回家過年的時候，我却像逃難似的擠上了京滬列車，以頭等客人的資格，總算在一節臥車廂的廁所門口，爭得了一席沙丁魚的地位。雖然，飽受車僮的侮辱和八小時饑飢渴；但我們都不在乎。因為這樣的場面，早在前年湘桂綫上體騐過了。況乎我們這次是着滿腔的熱望去參加「作協」的年會，並不是無目的地逃亡。
When people were all busy going home for the New Year, I squeezed onto the Beijing-Shanghai train like I was escaping. As a first-class passenger, I finally managed to get a sardine-like position at the toilet door of a sleeping car. Although we suffered the

### The More You Use Your Brain, The Smarter It Becomes. The Lazy Are Destined to Die Young. The Art of Longevity.

— Yu Qiang

Goethe, at eighty-two years old, still possessed an astonishing capacity for work, completing his masterpiece "Faust." The octogenarian Hugo consistently worked, brimming with vitality and creative energy. The renowned Italian artist Michelangelo, even in his eighties, diligently pursued his art. The great French painter Corot, on his eightieth birthday, painted one of his masterpieces.

Scientists exploring the secrets of longevity point out that the aforementioned artists never ceased their creative endeavors. "Fatigue," they will tell you, "is extremely dangerous for both the body and the mind. No mere lazy person will live long; only those who remain busy throughout their lives achieve longevity."

This comprehensive conclusion is confirmed by Dr. Oscar and Dr. Uter of the "Brain Research Institute" in Neustadt, Germany, who mentioned this in a communication with the authoritative British scientific magazine "Nature."

"If we allow our brains to become lazy," these two German researchers say, "we are digging our own graves."

Brain Cells Become Parasites

The limit of our lifespan is determined by the condition of our brain cells. If they are stimulated, they will be strengthened, and we can live to a ripe old age. If they are lazy and shirk work, they degenerate, and we live shorter lives than we should because our underused brains have become parasites that only eat and do not work.

There are hundreds of types of cells in the brain, each of which is responsible for a certain type of activity in the body. Together, they function like a superb headquarters, ensuring that the body's functions are quiet and efficient.

By the time we are three years old, we have acquired our lifetime supply of brain cells; they cannot reproduce themselves. The original cells acquired in childhood must directly facilitate thought, action, digestion, growth, and all the other complex processes of a living body.

If a cell dies, we lose it forever; nothing replaces it. If a few die, it may not have a significant impact on our personality or body. However, if an entire group dies, then certain parts of us cease to function. Thus, if the nerve center controlling the right leg dies, the right leg becomes paralyzed.

Uter said: "The secret to longevity is to use some working-class brain cells to strengthen them. They love activity and thrive on rapid and intense thought. If they are stimulated by countless nerve expansions, they can maintain excellent condition, and you can live a useful life far beyond the age of sixty or seventy."

Conversely, if you live a dull life with little stimulation, brain cells are used less. In complete frustration, they become weak and prematurely aged, hastening your death.

Busy People Have Healthy Brains

Uter and his colleagues, in their laboratories, have clearly established the fact that busy people develop strong and resilient brain cells, which means moving towards longevity.

"In the upbringing of individuals with special activities," they concluded, "there is a gradual possibility of delaying the normal death of the brain" (Translated from the February issue of "Reader's Digest").

### Bubbles

— Wang Deyun

Yesterday, I bought a foreign bubble and happily started "blowing" it.

With just a light "blow," the foreign bubble immediately grew much larger, as if a poor person had suddenly become rich and fat. Another blow, and it grew even larger; another blow, and it grew much, much larger.

"Great! Great!" My younger sister clapped her hands, admiring my "blowing" skills.

I became even more self-satisfied! So I continued my efforts, blowing vigorously, but my mother, "a clear-sighted observer," couldn't help but worry for me, immediately shouting to stop me: "Okay! Don't blow anymore! It's going to burst!"

No sooner said than done, the words had just left her mouth when there was a "pop!" and the balloon burst on cue!

"It's over, poor fatso!" I couldn't help but sigh. But the bursting of the bubble brought me even more enlightenment!

### New Year's Greetings

— Suo Ying

——Timely Doggerel——

Paying New Year's calls is tiring and wasteful, so much time, so much money! Just for everyone's sake of face, outdated customs are still followed from the past; everyone is just "going through the motions," why not abandon the custom and save "two coins"?

### Talking About Gold During the Spring Festival

— Kang Shi

Congratulations on getting rich, gold ingots on display.

In my hometown, there is a saying during the Lunar New Year: "Congratulations on getting rich, gold ingots on display," to wish people good luck in the New Year.

Before the war, the value of gold, especially "gold ingots," was truly extraordinarily high, and not something that ordinary people possessed. But in recent years, every Tom, Dick, and Harry, rickshaw pullers, maids, nannies, and older sisters are all "laden with gold"?

As the saying goes: "An ounce of gold is worth four ounces of good fortune." The reason why people today have increased "good fortune" is that it has nothing to do with us intellectuals, but has been taken first by the general "laboring" workers! Isn't that so? What they and she wear and put on their hands is yellowish-green, dazzling, and enviable! Since the advent of the new Customs Gold Unit, even more people have inquired about gold. During this New Year, buying a few gold rings or gold jewelry is no big deal, and even buying "gold ingots" doesn't take much effort. Unexpectedly, my hometown's (Minhang) saying "Congratulations on getting rich, gold ingots on display" has become a "premonition"!

So gold, despite "rising," can be "sold" and "allocated" while it rises?

Opening the newspaper on the New Year, one sees the news that "about 30 tons of gold will be shipped from Mexico," which is indeed a striking news item!

At the same time, fearing that the price of gold will continue to rise, which is too stimulating for prices, several thousand taels have been "sold and allocated" in the first two days of the New Year. This is the "concern" after the issuance of the new Customs Gold Unit, but "rising" is still "rising," but it only makes the appearance rise more slowly!

"Constantly pouring out gold," "Constantly bringing gold from overseas," but ultimately unable to stop the "rising trend." In this situation, it is no wonder that the soaring cost of living for civilians cannot be "lowered" and is "at a loss"!

There is more and more gold in the hands of the people every day, and it will soon become a "golden country"! Where can one see today feeling "impoverished"?

But although "gold is everywhere," one "cannot eat when hungry" and "cannot wear clothes when cold." The fact that the price of goods and the price of gold do not have the "ratio" they had before the war is still a serious issue!

### God of Wealth

— Suo Bei

Where are you going?

On the night of "the fourth day of the New Year," every household frantically sets off firecrackers to welcome the God of Wealth. Yes, everyone has been poor enough in this year, who doesn't welcome the God of Wealth?

But, God of Wealth, which house are you going to after all? Is the money you bring enough to distribute to these many wealth seekers? Do you give wealth to "good" people based on the Stove God's report? If that's the case, I must advise you: the Stove God received abundant offerings on the night of the twenty-fourth of the twelfth lunar month, quietly ascended to heaven, and played a confused tune. He was obviously bribed! The families that truly need the God of Wealth's assistance probably don't have the money to buy lavish gifts to honor the Stove God.

Amidst the sound of firecrackers, God of Wealth, I humbly ask you: don't be confused by the colorful offerings of wealthy families. If that's the case, I'm afraid the year of Bingxu will still be a case of "the rich getting richer and the poor getting poorer"!

God of Wealth! Where are you going?

### Natural Philosophy

— Muyu

Although he opens his mouth wide, like a political orator, as if he has great mysteries, in reality, he is just an idiot, with no political arguments to make—unless you hit his head with a stick, but there is no reaction, only answering you with one word: "Put!"

Funnel

Borrow his mouth to swallow things into other people's stomachs. Once other people's stomachs are full, they throw him away.

Trash can

Even though he himself is very clean, he has such a great capacity to accommodate filth, that he naturally becomes a synonym for all filth.

That being the case, in the past, the customers in silver shops were respectable gentry, but now the feng shui has changed, and they are all short-sleeved, rough-handed, and crude-footed types. This kind of "transformation" is something that even gods could not have predicted. This is also a "deformed" transformation!

### The Dignity of National Law, Impartiality in Public Affairs; Yang Sen's Spirit is Worth Emulating!

— Zhong Yi

Yang Chuanshan, the younger brother of Guizhou Provincial Chairman Yang Sen, used his brother's name to smuggle two large trucks of opium while his brother was in Beijing. The matter was discovered by the detective team, who immediately telegraphed Yang Sen to ask for instructions on how to handle it. Yang Sen replied by telegram to handle it strictly. Yang Chuanshan then committed suicide by shooting himself.

This is a rare piece of news. In today's world where only human sentiment is valued and national law is disregarded, it is worthy of great praise that someone can "put righteousness above family" without showing favoritism.

The root of the Chinese problem is that they are good at "showing favoritism," applying the law differently to good and bad people, and judging crimes entirely based on human sentiment. On the surface, it seems to conform to ethical concepts, but in reality, it neglects the word "righteousness," not only failing to "put righteousness above family" but also "putting family above righteousness."

Having said that, Yang Sen's act of "putting righteousness above family" is what should be done! It is inevitable! It is not surprising in itself! But in today's society of favoritism, it is indeed commendable and worthy of great praise. Not only is it worthy of great praise, but it is also worthy of the government's telegram of commendation.

Although Chairman Yang sentenced his brother according to national law, I think Chairman Yang must be very sad in his heart. His own brother died at his own hands, which is inevitably "cruel" in terms of ethics. But national law is ultimately national law, and human sentiment cannot prevail.

There are too many cases like this, and I hope there are countless Yang Sens!

### The World of Terror

— Gao Minggui

Science is constantly advancing, and new weapons of killing are emerging in an endless stream. After the end of World War II, scientists from various countries are still immersed in the research of new weapons, which shows that the back of this world still hides unavoidable war. The January 17th issue of the New York-published "Collier's" magazine contains an article written by Cocktone, which stated that Soviet scientists at the Remigrad Institute of Technology are trying to find a way to research a "gap" that allows the deadly ultraviolet rays in the sun to pass through the Earth's atmosphere, instantly destroying any enemy country. If the power of "ultraviolet rays" is concentrated to pass through the "atmosphere" and irradiate any enemy country, it would be enough to destroy the country and all its residents instantly, as easily as "sweeping away dead leaves."

If this "solar weapon" is successfully researched, its power to threaten the world and destroy mankind will be greater than that of the atomic bomb. In today's chaotic post-war situation, with the winds and clouds of Europe and Asia unpredictable, hearing this is even more shocking. Science benefits mankind a lot, but the power of harm is even greater. Today, mankind's enjoyment of material civilization has reached its peak, and the threat to life is also increasing. In reality, there is no distinction between "civilization" and "barbarism"!

### Dead Man's Eyeball

— Wu Hong

Antimonde, a thirty-one-year-old Catholic priest in Reno, Nevada, lost his sight in his right eye ten years ago after being shot. Recently, a surgeon surgically implanted the eyeball from the body of a murderer who was executed for murdering a woman in Reno into Antimonde's right eye. Thirty-six hours later, he was able to see again. Doctors originally stipulated that it would take three weeks to determine whether the new surgery was successful, but the effect was so quick. The murderer, whose eyeball was borrowed after death, was executed in Nevada's "gas chamber" on the tenth of this month.

There used to be a legend: an omnipotent medical doctor reattached the arm of a dead thief to a cripple with a broken right arm and replaced the heart of a heart patient with a lion's heart. The surgeries were successful and seamless, but after a few days, the two people who had undergone surgery went to him. The cripple who had his arm reattached said that he often unconsciously went to steal other people's things, and the heart patient, since having a lion's heart, only wanted to eat people all day long. The medical doctor was so entangled that he committed suicide.

Now that a murderer's "dead man's eyeball" has been implanted in the right eye of the blind Catholic priest, I wonder if things look a little different?

After the Amnesty>
— Fang Wen

Recently, the amnesty order has arrived at courts across the country, and they are busy handling release procedures. The number of people pardoned this time is large, a great act of grace, a glorious event for the ages. However, this large group of people has been trapped behind bars for many years, isolated from society. After being released, there are many who have no home to return to, wandering in an unfamiliar society like a flock of lost sheep, unable to find a path to self-renewal. Although they have gained freedom, they have lost their livelihood. Originally, in this day and age, "freedom and livelihood" are not easy to achieve at the same time. Therefore, among this group of people who have been released, some have asked to return to prison, and some have committed crimes again and returned to prison. Such cases are constantly emerging, forming a new and difficult social problem. However, within this cumbersome new problem, the relative importance of "freedom and livelihood" is revealed.
