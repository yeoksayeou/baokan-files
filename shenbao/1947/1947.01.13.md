### Negotiations in Shanghai Conclude Temporarily; Overall Situation Remains Uncertain in the Near Future; Sun Ke, Zhang Qun, and Lei Zhen Returned to Nanjing Last Night

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 12th] Neutral sources indicate that after a period of negotiations in Shanghai, the focus of peace talks will soon shift to Nanjing. It is reported that the Communist Party is paying close attention to the government's specific proposals and is eager to learn how the government intends to resolve the military and political issues between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. They believe that whether negotiations can proceed depends entirely on the government's attitude towards the two points raised by the Communist Party.

[Our Dispatch] Sun Ke, Zhang Qun, and Lei Zhen all took the night train yesterday to Nanjing to report on their mission, while Wu Tiecheng remains in Shanghai. Lei told reporters in a hurried manner that he visited Zhang Junmai yesterday to inquire about his eye ailment. He stated that Zhang will go to Nanjing as soon as his eye condition improves. The government currently has no concrete plan to resolve the current situation, and everything needs to be decided after detailed discussions in Nanjing. Lei believes that if efforts are needed to mediate the resumption of peace talks, all parties are willing to assist. However, as of now, both direct negotiations and mediation efforts are still being considered. There is currently no new basis for resuming peace talks, but the government has full sincerity. If the Communist Party changes its attitude, peace talks can be quickly resumed.

[Central News Agency, this city] Lei Zhen returned to Nanjing last night. Before his departure, he told reporters that how to resume peace talks depends on the government's decision after discussion. Regarding the steps to reopen peace talks, the government will certainly put forward a plan first as a basis for negotiations with the Communist Party. The government has long planned to send personnel to Yan'an, but the selection of candidates has not yet been determined.

[Our Dispatch] Government representatives Zhang Qun and Lei Zhen, Youth Party representatives Li Huang and Zuo Shunsheng, and Social Democratic Party representatives Wu Xianzi and Wan Gongqian, etc., held their last exchange of views in Zhang Qun's private residence yesterday before the government representatives went to Nanjing. During the talks, both the Youth Party and the Social Democratic Party expressed their support for President Sun's proposal to convene a party roundtable meeting. Neither party put forward a plan to resolve the current difficult situation. According to someone who participated in the talks, the government also has no concrete plan at present. As for the method of resuming military peace talks, it has not yet been decided. However, the government is prepared to send representatives to Yan'an, but whether peace talks can be realized soon depends entirely on the attitude of the Communist Party. Given the current situation, it is difficult to expect the overall situation to improve in the short term.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 12th] Jiang Yuntian of the Social Democratic Party visited Zhang Zhizhong at 6:00 PM on the 12th to exchange views. According to Jiang, the party is very satisfied with Sun Ke's proposal to convene a roundtable meeting. He believes that the Communist Party will not oppose it verbally, but hopes that no specific conditions will be put forward, as this would only cause both parties to become deadlocked. Jiang explained that the party's recent efforts are all aimed at promoting the early resumption of peace talks, and believes that if both parties can make mutual concessions and trust each other, everything will not be difficult to resolve. Jiang refused to speculate on the focus of the roundtable meeting's discussions. When asked about the party's view on Marshal Ma's statement, Jiang said: "Marshal Ma's statement is both just and fair, which shows that he has grasped the core of the problem during his time in China." Jiang stated that he would not go to Shanghai in the short term, and Zhang Junmai is suffering from a severe cold, so it is uncertain whether he will come to Nanjing.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 12th] Zhou Qianchong, a standing committee member of the Youth Party, came to Nanjing on the 11th and had a brief meeting with Ambassador Stuart and Shao Lizi, and then went to Shanghai that evening.

[Central News Agency, this city] Hong Lanyou, Secretary-General of the National Assembly, came to Shanghai on business a few days ago and took a military plane back to Nanjing last night. It is reported that before leaving Shanghai, Hong had private friendly meetings with Zhang Junmai and Zeng Qi.

### Twenty-Four Chinese Passengers Were All Scheduled to Fly to Hong Kong

[United Press, this city, 12th] The Liaodong Air Transport Company's four-engine Constellation aircraft, "Miss Luzon," carrying 24 Chinese passengers and 6 British passengers, was forced to land in the sea north of Luzon Island on the 11th due to weather conditions that prevented it from landing at Kai Tak Airport in Hong Kong. The aircraft departed from Shanghai on the 11th with a crew of 12, including 5 Americans and the rest Filipinos. Among the 30 passengers, only two Chinese passengers were going to Manila, and the remaining 28 were going to Hong Kong.

"Miss Luzon" was originally scheduled to fly out of Shanghai last Tuesday, but it was delayed until Saturday due to bad weather.

### Marshal Ma Will Arrive in the United States This Week; Reportedly, There is No Evidence of Soviet Aid to the Chinese Communist Party; US Senators Advocate That US Troops Should Remain in China

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 11th] Regarding the replacement of the old and new US Secretaries of State, it has been learned that Byrnes will continue to serve as Secretary of State until the 14th of this month, and the new Secretary of State, Marshal Marshall, will arrive in Washington in early or mid-next week. Marshall is now in Hawaii, meeting with his wife. Byrnes has received a private letter from him. According to White House Press Secretary Ross this morning, President Truman has allowed Marshall to decide his date of arrival in Washington.

[Our Dispatch] San Francisco, 12th, Honolulu broadcast: Marshall said regarding the claim that he will attend the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference, that this is just an assumption.

[United Press, Honolulu, 11th] Marshal Marshall informally met with reporters at Fort Shafter here today. He said that the recent anti-American sentiment expressed by Chinese students was instigated by someone, but he did not specify who was behind it. He also said that there is no evidence that the Chinese Communist Party has received Soviet aid. Marshall said: "I quite wanted to retire and live a private life. Being appointed as Secretary of State is a new calling, and I will do my best to fulfill my national duty." When asked whether the new position is more important than his wartime Chief of Staff of the Army position, Marshall replied: "In one sense, I think the new position is more important. I was originally a soldier, and now I will take on a new mission. Leading a war is certainly difficult, but this is my lifelong career." Marshall did not comment on the reaction to his departure statement from China.

[United Press, Washington, 11th] Four members of Congress today advocated that the United States should at least station some troops in China as a symbol to guarantee America's concern for China's restoration of stability and to prevent Soviet influence. These four congressmen expressed their opinions separately on the statement made by Special Envoy Marshall upon his departure from China. Among them, Representative Short, a member of the House Military Affairs Committee, inspected China last autumn. He said: "We really have no choice. If the US military withdraws from China, Soviet influence will immediately spread throughout China." Others, such as Republican member Marley and Democratic member Sykes, have also traveled to China. The plane said: "The US military must remain stationed in China, half for defense against the Soviet Union and half for stabilizing the opposing Chinese forces." Martin also said: "The withdrawal of US troops from China will only make the Soviet Union more aggressive in China. He is willing to accept any suggestions from Marshall."

### Mining and Transportation Industries Encourage Investment from All Sectors; The Ministries of Finance and Economy Have Drafted Measures

[United Press, Nanjing, 12th] The Ministries of Finance and Economy have recently taken various measures to encourage investment from all sectors in the mining and transportation industries. The Supreme National Defense Council has approved ten articles jointly drafted by the two ministries as the basis for calculating the old shares of mining and shipping companies according to the current legal tender, in order to accommodate new shares. An official from the Ministry of Economic Affairs explained that many mining and shipping companies are feeling a shortage of funds and have applied for government loans. These companies cannot absorb new investments to increase operating funds because old shareholders do not know the current value of the shares they purchased years ago, so they do not welcome new investments. The purpose of formulating the regulations is to eliminate this obstacle. The method is that old shares can be calculated according to the current price index, so as to absorb new investments.

### One Year of Mediation Work

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 12th] Today is the first anniversary of the establishment of the Executive Headquarters of the Military Mediation Department in Beiping. As of tonight, the 12th, no commemorative ceremony has been heard from any party.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 12th] With the flames of war spreading and peace talks dimming, Marshal's return to the United States has increased national concern about the future survival of the Military Mediation Department. Established in Beiping on January 13, 1946, it has reached its anniversary. Recalling the gains and losses of the mediation work over the past year, a comprehensive analysis and report are provided below:

(1) Efforts and Failures of the Mediation Work Over the Past Year:

January: On the 10th, the government issued a ceasefire order, effective from midnight on the 13th. On the same day, Mao Zedong of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) issued a ceasefire order. On the 13th, the Military Mediation Department was established in Beiping. Three committee members, Robertson, Deputy Chief of the US Embassy; Zheng Jiemin, Director of the Second Department of the Military Command; and Ye Jianying, Chief of Staff of the 18th Group Army, flew to Beiping together. From the outset, the Military Mediation Department actively started its work, dispatching ceasefire execution groups to various conflict areas and issuing Order No. 1, ordering the National Army and Communist Army near Yongnian to cease conflict. Order No. 2 conveyed the principles and methods for implementing the ceasefire. National Army generals in various regions received the ceasefire order and complied with it, welcoming the Gu mediation teams to carry out their missions and providing them with convenience. On the 23rd, the Luoshan Agreement was established to cease the conflict. From midnight on the 13th, the Communist Army in various parts of North China continued to attack the National Army, successively capturing Yingkou in the Northeast; Zichuan and Boshan in Shandong; Yutian and Fengrun in Hebei; Mengxian and Kaocheng in Henan; Houma and Fushan in Shanxi; and Jining in Suiyuan. From the 14th, the Communist Army in northern Jiangsu destroyed the eastern section of the Longhai Railway and occupied the Jiaoji Railway and Zihudian and Jieshou stations on the Jinpu Railway, which were originally guarded by the National Army. The towns of Liancheng, Dezhou, Changqing, Tai'an, and Yanzhou in Shandong; Qin County and Wenxi in Shanxi; and Botou and Yongnian in Hebei continued to be besieged by the Communist Army. In addition, 40,000 troops were transferred by the Communist Army in Shanxi, entering the Northeast via Pingquan and Jianchang in Rehe.

February: Government and CCP representatives discussed the reorganization and unified compilation of troops in Chongqing. On the 25th, the "Basic Plan for Military Reorganization" was signed in Chongqing, stipulating that the national army, including the Communist Army, would be reorganized in two phases. The Military Mediation Department established a joint staff headquarters, continuing to send execution teams to areas within the Communist Army's territory and dispatching several transportation teams to various railway lines damaged by the CCP to assist in supervising repairs, and began the work of repatriating Japanese prisoners and overseas Chinese. During the same month, the Beiping Military Mediation Department issued Order No. 3, resolving disputes over the issue of puppet troops; Order No. 4, instructing methods for restoring transportation; and Order No. 5, instructing matters related to the repatriation of prisoners. The ceasefire execution teams sent to various regions encountered the most thorny issue of puppet troops. After several consultations, an agreement was finally reached. Order No. 3 of the Military Mediation Department stipulated that the puppet troops recognized by the government or the CCP and their opposing forces should maintain their positions as of midnight on January 13, or as determined by the execution team. The puppet troop issue was finally resolved, while the Communist Army continued to besiege the towns it had been besieging the previous month. Xiao Ke's troops captured Jianping and Jianchang in Rehe. The Communist Army in Hebei attacked Dongguang again and continued to destroy the Jiaoji, Pinghan, and Jinpu railways, hindering mediation work. The Communist Army in Tai'an surrounded a mediation team, robbing them of materials. In the Northeast, they actively prepared for war. Over 10,000 troops from the Communist Army in Hebei entered the Northeast by land through eastern Hebei and Rehe, and over 40,000 troops from the Communist Army in Shandong were transported to the Northeast by sea. On the 9th, the Dezhou team agreement was signed to cease conflict and ensure the transport of grain and trade. On the 13th, the Houma team signed a temporary agreement in Linfen, guaranteeing transportation and communication. On the 15th, the Tai'an team signed the Tai'an Agreement, guaranteeing grain transport. All of these were subsequently violated by the CCP.

March: Mediation work reached its peak. The three representatives of the Military Three-Person Group, Zhang Zhizhong, Marshall, and Zhou Enlai, jointly inspected Zhangjiakou, Jining, Guihua, Taiyuan, Jinan, Xuzhou, Hankou, and other places to supervise the cessation of conflict in order to thoroughly implement the ceasefire order. At the same time, the government agreed to extend the mediation work to the nine northeastern provinces. On the 22nd, the Military Mediation Department issued Order No. 6, confirming the positions of all troops as of midnight on January 13. On the Communist Army side, they launched an offensive in the Northeast. Lin Biao's troops captured Sipingjie, preventing the National Army from moving north to take over sovereignty. The Communist Army in Rehe attacked Lingyuan and Chaoyang. The Communist Army of Jin-Cha-Ji (Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei) entered the Northeast by land, reaching 80,000 troops. During the same month, the National Army began reorganization, while the Communist Army greatly expanded. The conscription movement was prevalent in the "Liberated Areas." The original New Fourth Army and 18th Group Army entered the Northeast, retaining their original designations in the interior and replenishing their forces. All of this increased the difficulty of mediation work. The mediation work of the teams in various regions was also very active in March, successively establishing the Dangba Agreement, the Chaoyang Agreement, the Dongming Agreement, the Datong Agreement, and the Jianchang Agreement, stipulating the cessation of conflict or mutual withdrawal in their respective regions.

April: The Communist Army launched a major offensive in the Northeast, and the conflict spread. On the 15th, Xu Yongchang, Minister of Military Affairs and representative of the Military Three-Person Group, sent Qin Decun, Vice Minister, along with General Qing Lan, representative of Marshal's special envoy, and Zhou Enlai, representative of the CCP, to inspect the Northeast and seek peace. The Communist Army in the Northeast successively captured Harbin, Qiqihar, and Changchun. Over 10,000 troops from the Communist Army in Shandong and over 20,000 troops from the Communist Army in Shanxi continued to enter northern Jiangsu by sea and land. At the same time, the Communist Army in northern Jiangsu invaded Nantong, threatening Nanjing and Shanghai. They also continued to destroy transportation in the occupied areas, preventing repairs and refusing to allow the dispatch of military mediation teams to Changchun and Harbin. The first phase of the National Army's reorganization was announced as completed this month. On the 6th, the Jinan team signed an agreement guaranteeing the cessation of conflict and the exchange of materials. On the 7th, the Dezhou team signed the Botou Agreement, ceasing conflict. On the 14th, the Dongming Agreement was signed, stipulating the maintenance of original positions.

May: The CCP claimed that Li Xiannian's troops in the Central Plains Military Region were surrounded by the National Army. Xu Yongchang, government representative of the Military Three-Person Group, accompanied by Blue de Roude, the American Executive Director of the Military Mediation Department, and Zhou Enlai, representative of the CCP, went to inspect. The government provided Li's troops with cash, allowing them to purchase grain and transport wounded soldiers and their families to Henan. The Communist Army in various regions launched the "May Offensive." In the Northeast, the Communist Army gathered in the Sipingjie and Gongzhuling areas to prevent the National Army from moving north, with some troops attacking Anshan and Haicheng. In Shandong, they massively destroyed the Jiaoji Railway, besieging Jinan from three sides. The Communist Army on the northern section of the Pinghan Railway attacked Xushui and Dingxing. The Communist Army on the northern section of the Jinpu Railway detained representatives of the government and the United States from the 18th Transportation Team and occupied Botou Station. The Communist Army in northern Henan captured Dongming. The Communist Army in Rehe occupied Beipiao, destroying the mining area and attacking Pingquan. In the Northeast, the National Army, in order to take over sovereignty, was forced to defend itself after suffering countless attacks. On the 19th and 23rd, they successively recovered Sipingjie and Changchun. On the 12th, the Xinxiang Agreement was signed, ceasing conflict and troop movements. On the 22nd, the Hankou Agreement was signed, ceasing conflict.

June: On the 7th, the government ordered the National Army in the Northeast to cease its advance and set a deadline of the 15th to discuss the cessation of conflict in the Northeast with the CCP. On the 23rd, the deadline was extended to the end of the month. During this period, the Military Mediation Department established a Changchun branch and dispatched eight teams to Anshan, Hailong, Haicheng, Lafa, Dehui, Shuangchengpu, Qiqihar, and Sipingjie in the Northeast to ensure the effective cessation of conflict. In addition, approximately 3,000 soldiers from the "East River Column" of the Communist Army in Guangdong safely boarded ships and withdrew to Yantai with the assistance of the Eighth Team and local government and military authorities. During this month, the Communist Army refused to propose a deadline for implementing the military reorganization agreement, restoring transportation, and measures to cease conflict in the Northeast. Furthermore, Li's troops in the "Central Plains Military Region" violated the agreement and raided western Henan, northern Hubei, and western Anhui from the Guangshan and Xuanhuadian areas in three groups. In addition, Hao Pengju's "Democratic National Construction Army" of 20,000 troops attacked the National Army in Donghai. The Beipiao Agreement was signed on the 6th, and the Pingquan Temporary Agreement was signed on the 7th, ceasing attacks and troop movements. The Handan meeting records on the 19th decided on a truce in Yongnian, all of which were violated by the Communist Army.

July: The Communist Army launched a fierce offensive in northern Jiangsu. On the 15th, they captured Taixing north of the Yangtze River with a force of 13 regiments and invaded Nantong, Taixian, Yangzhou, Liuhe, and other places, attempting to cross the river and threaten Nanjing and Shanghai. The Communist Army in Shanxi captured Fanqi, Guoxian, and Qin County, and attacked the outer areas of Datong, including Huairen, Kouquan, and Pingwang. Li's troops in the "Central Plains Military Region" continued to raid northern Hubei and western Henan in separate groups, refusing mediation. At the end of this month, the National Army defended Nanjing and Shanghai and successively recovered cities captured by the Communist Army, such as Tai'an and Rugao. On the 7th, the Houma team signed the Linfen-Quwo Agreement, guaranteeing trade.

August: Yan'an issued a general mobilization order. The Communist Army in Shanxi fiercely attacked Datong, using Japanese prisoners of war to fight, determined to capture it. In order to relieve the siege of Datong, the National Army in Rehe advanced to Chengde at the end of the month. Liu Bocheng's troops of the Communist Army launched an offensive in western Shandong and northern Henan, capturing Kaifeng, Yucheng, and Jieshan, and actively destroying the Guan-Hai Railway. The Communist Army in northern Jiangsu fiercely attacked the outer areas of Xuzhou, destroying the dikes of the Grand Canal, the Shu River, and the Fanwei River, causing severe disasters.

### Sweeping Campaign Launched on the Pingjin Line National Army Recaptures Wuqing City Siege of Xianghe Relieved Langfang and Luofa Stabilized

[Our newspaper, Tianjin, 12th] The Communist Army east of the Pingjin area took advantage of the National Army's defense gap to attack Wuqing County City on the morning of the 11th. After the National Army's reinforcements arrived, they launched a counterattack and recovered Wuqing by noon on the 12th. However, the actions of the Communist Army on the Pinghan, Beining, and Jinpu lines in the north clearly had a comprehensive plan. The people along the lines in the ice and snow will inevitably continue to suffer from the Communist Army's artillery fire.

[Our newspaper, Beiping, 12th] After the Communist Army cut off the Pingjin Highway and captured Wuqing, Beiping and Tianjin were affected, and food prices in Beiping soared today. Sun Tongzhong sent a telegram from Beijing, strictly ordering attention. The military leaders here went to the front line to direct the battle today. The reinforcements from Beiping and Tianjin arrived at their destinations along the railway and highway separately, and the sweeping battle began. The siege of Xianghe County City was relieved, and the garrison had launched an attack, successively recovering Matou, Anping, and Wangjiaquan on the Pingjin Highway. The crises at Langfang, Luofa, Shizhangzhuang, Yangcun, and other stations on the Pingjin Railway have been lifted. The Communist Army participating in this attack was the entire Zeng Yongya unit of the 14th Military Sub-district, claiming to have 10,000 people, with four or five regiments participating in the battle. The main force was half in Hexiwu and Wuqing west of the Grand Canal, and half in Baozhen and Dachangzhen north of Xianghe east of the Grand Canal. The situation in Tongxian and Daxing gradually stabilized, but the local losses were quite large wherever the Communist Army passed. The cocoon forts and public buildings were completely destroyed, and each rebuilt fort required 40 to 50 million yuan.

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 11th] The Wuqing detachment of the Communist Army attacked Zaolinzhuang between Langfang and Luofa on the night of the 10th and was repelled by the National Army.

[Central News Agency, Baoding, 12th] More than 2,000 Communist troops attacked the Shigecun stronghold southwest of Xushui at about 11 p.m. on the 11th and were repelled by the National Army.

[Central News Agency, Baoding, 12th] At 2 p.m. on the 11th, 80 meters of the railway track 2 kilometers north of Caohe on the Pinghan Line was destroyed by a Communist Army landmine and has now been repaired.

[Agence France-Presse, Beiping, 12th] The reports in some newspapers that traffic between Beiping and Tianjin was blocked have been found to be inaccurate. Yesterday, trucks and cars traveled between the two places. However, it is reported that Communist troops are active in the suburbs. So far, there has been no large-scale military activity in Hebei Province, but it is generally expected that the Communist Army will expand its obstruction tactics to contain the larger National Army and limit its deployment to the Northeast. It has also been denied by military circles that the Communist Army is attacking near the Songhua River crossing northeast of Changchun and near Jilin.

### Situation in Southern Shandong Takes a Sharp Turn National Army Controls the Linzao Line Communist Army Retreats After Attacking Yixian and Hanzhuang

[Our newspaper, Zhenjiang, 12th] After the news that the National Army had recovered Shuyang and that two powerful corps had reinforced the outer areas of Xuzhou reached the border area between Jiangsu and Shandong, the National Army's military prestige was greatly enhanced, and the situation in southern Shandong also took a sharp turn. After defeating the two divisions of the Communist Army that were besieging Yixian and attacking Zaozhuang, a certain mobile corps of the National Army has controlled the entire Taizao line. Another unit of the National Army is advancing towards Xiangcheng.

[Our newspaper, Xuzhou, 12th] Intense mixed battles continued along the Linzao branch line on the 11th. Although the Communist Army's offensive has been fierce in recent days, it has gradually come to an end after the National Army's separate resistance. The Communist Army attacked Zaozhuang Station on the 11th and continued to attack the Zhongxing Coal Mining Company. The garrison is currently resisting strongly.

[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 12th] When the Communist Army fiercely attacked Yixian on the night of the 11th, they sent a detachment of troops to spy on Zhoujiaying outside Hanzhuang to the south. You Shixian, a veteran of the Youth Army, was moved by righteous indignation and contacted Xu Changju, the deputy township chief of the area, to mobilize more than 500 villagers to fight back with self-defense firearms. They fought a bloody battle with the Communist Army all night in the ice and snow, and finally the Communist Army retreated north with injuries, and Hanzhuang remained safe and sound.

[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 12th] The Communist Army's plan to attack the Taizao branch line is becoming increasingly urgent. On the night of the 11th, they moved the troops attacking Yixian to continue their attack on Zaozhuang. A detachment broke into Zaozhuang Station.

### One Year of Mediation Work

Continued from the First Page

September: The Communist army in Shanxi is besieging Datong with increasing urgency. To relieve the siege of Datong, the troops of the 11th and 12th War Zones are preparing to attack Zhangjiakou. Fu Zuoyi's troops are stationed in Changning and Fengzhen. The Communist army in northern Jiangsu is stationed in Huaiyin and Huaian and launches an offensive on the northern section of the Pinghan Railway, forcing the siege of Baoding, the seat of the Hebei Provincial Government.

October: Conflicts throughout the country become increasingly serious. The offensive by the Communist army in the northern section of the Pinghan Railway reaches its peak. The Nationalist army in Xushui, Wangdu, Rongcheng, Xincheng, Dingxian, and other places is attacked. Baoding is surrounded on all sides, and traffic between Pingbao and Baoshi is cut off. 200 kilometers of the railway is destroyed, and Tianjin and Beijing are under unprecedented threat. The Communist army in northern Shaanxi attacks Yulin. Special Envoy Marshall makes a suggestion for a ten-day ceasefire to save peace. The government accepts, but the CCP rejects it. The troops of the 12th War Zone entered Zhangjiakou on the 11th. Since the beginning of October, the Communist army has launched an offensive in the Northeast. During the same month, the representatives of the CCP in the mediation executive groups and the transportation groups within the country all requested withdrawal and returned to Peiping one after another.

November: The government issued a nationwide ceasefire order, effective from noon on the 11th. The Communist army in various places launched offensives again. In Shandong, Pingdu and Changyi were captured, Jiaoxian was besieged, and Jinan was attacked; in northern Jiangsu, both Huai'an and Huaiyin were attacked; in Shanxi, they continued to spy on Datong, and one unit attacked Fenhe in the west, besieging Yulin; within the Northeast, the representatives of the CCP in the task force all withdrew to Changchun, declaring to the government and American representatives in the Communist-occupied areas that they would not be responsible for security. The representatives of both parties were forced to withdraw to Changchun due to the situation.

December: Mediation work came to a complete standstill. However, the government and American representatives of the various executive groups remained stationed in the Nationalist-occupied areas inside and outside the customs. Communist troops in various places continued to harass. Within Hebei Province, Baoding continued to be besieged, threatening the Beijing-Ningbo line and the traffic line between Tianjin, Beijing and Baoding; within Shanxi Province, Zhongyang was attacked; within Shandong Province, Liancheng was fiercely attacked; within Chahar Province, the people of Chongli were massacred; another unit continued to destroy the Jiaoji Railway, hindering the project to close the breach in the Yellow River.

(II) Analysis of the Reasons Why Mediation Work Failed to Be Completed Smoothly:

The mediation work has been going on for a year. In addition to completing the work of sending Japanese prisoners of war home, it has failed to achieve the expected goals of a complete cessation of conflict, restoration of transportation, and reorganization of the army, which is regrettable. The main reasons for this are: first, the Communist army's continuous violation of orders to attack, sabotage transportation, and expand armaments, which directly impacted the mediation work; and second, the Communist army's obstruction of the task force's implementation of tasks in various places, which indirectly hindered the progress of the mediation work.

Details of the Communist army's violation of orders to attack and destroy transportation have been described in the aforementioned year of mediation. Since the ceasefire order on January 13, the Communist army has taken advantage of the Nationalist army's compliance with the order to cease fire and moved from remote mountainous areas to various railway lines, destroying railway tracks and besieging towns in order to control various transportation hubs and seize advantageous positions. In order to coordinate with the Northeast war, they launched an offensive in May, launching large-scale attacks in Rehe, Shandong, Henan, Hebei, and other places, shattering the hopes for peace that the executive groups had worked hard for for several months. Since the end of June, the Communist army has completely controlled Shandong and Shanxi, completing its encirclement strategy in North China, threatening the government on the one hand in order to gain an advantageous position in the negotiations, and on the other hand, simultaneously attacking the Nationalist army in Shandong, Henan, and Shanxi, preparing for a full-scale civil unrest in the event of failed negotiations. Since the beginning of July, the Communist army has launched a large-scale attack on cities and territories in North China and northern Jiangsu, thinking of completing the partitioning of North China, threatening the capital on the one hand to make the government lose its position and credibility in the peace talks, and on the other hand, completing the CCP's conspiracy of division and partitioning. At the same time, when the Communist army's offensives in various places were attacked, they launched an anti-American movement, slandering the US government and its policies, wantonly vilifying American mediators, and taking actions to threaten the safety of American mediation personnel. Since the ceasefire order took effect on January 13, they have continuously destroyed transportation and prevented repairs, making it impossible for the mediation work to progress. In addition, they have greatly expanded their military forces in various places inside and outside the customs, making the battlefield even wider, and the war has not ceased for a single day, causing the mediation work to come to a complete standstill.

In the past year, the Communist army indirectly advanced by delaying or restricting the task forces' personnel sent to various places from carrying out their missions. The most extreme manifestation of their obstruction of task force actions was the unauthorized detention of task force personnel, or even their murder. This type of fact has emerged endlessly in recent years. The most prominent cases are the killing of Major Lei Fenqiang of the 23rd Group in Yancheng by the Communist army on June 10, and the killing of Major Guo Ziqi, translator of the 10th Group of New 1st Army, in Sunzhuang on June 19. Major Min Qingchu was also shot and wounded. Later, at the end of July, the Communist army abducted seven US Marines in Beidaihe one after another, and fabricated the Xianghe incident, killing three American soldiers and injuring eleven. The motivation was also to threaten the safety of American mediation personnel. All of these are sufficient to force the mediation work to suffer unexpected difficulties.

Looking back on the mediation of the past year, although it failed to achieve the goal of complete peace, it has given us a clear understanding. Because its own gains and losses are a clear test, the CCP still blindly believes in force and does not take the path of peace. Today, the world and China both urgently need peace, and the unity and prosperity of our country depends even more on the early realization of peace. Mediation work is the only shortcut to achieving peace, and it is also a manifestation of the highest human wisdom. Although the efforts of the past year have not been fully successful, Chinese and foreign peace-loving people still place their earnest hope on this mediation mechanism. (End)

Editorial

### Restoring Peace Talks Should Begin with Sincerity!

In recent days, Nanjing and Shanghai have been filled with an atmosphere of restoring peace talks. On the 9th, Mr. Peng Xuepei made a statement in Beijing, expressing that the government is willing to sincerely discuss concrete measures with the CCP regarding issues such as the cessation of conflict and the reorganization of the government. On the 10th, Mr. Sun Ke also made a suggestion on the current situation in Shanghai, advocating that all parties should hold a roundtable conference immediately. All parties attach great importance to the statements of Mr. Peng and Mr. Sun, so the atmosphere of restoring peace talks has become stronger in recent days. In today's extremely depressing situation, being able to breathe some air of peace talks is ultimately a gratifying phenomenon and cannot but be regarded as a ray of dawn for the future of the Chinese situation. At the same time, we cannot help but point out that the peaceful resolution of the KMT-CPC problem is the best opportunity today. The government, parties, and the people of the whole country must seize the opportunity in a timely manner, find ways to break the current political deadlock, and achieve the common desire of peaceful unification, democratic nation-building.

Since the completion of the constitution-making work of the National Assembly and its successful opening, our ordinary people have always focused their attention on the two things of restoring peace talks and reorganizing the government, eagerly waiting for the good news to spread. However, for the past fifteen days, the people's attention has moved with the whereabouts of government officials, sometimes in Nanjing and sometimes in Shanghai. They are almost straining their eyes to see, and at the same time, they are constantly worrying and anxious, fearing that the air of peace talks will be blown away again. Why do the people care so much about national affairs? The simple answer is because in the hearts of our 450 million people, there is a desire for "peaceful unification, democratic nation-building."

I remember during the arduous period of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the people of the whole country endured hardship and were unwilling to give up their lives and property, bravely advancing and fighting the enemy to the death, and finally won the glory of victory. However, just as we were about to enjoy the peace, unification, and democratic nation-building, the happiness that the people of a victorious country should enjoy was swallowed up by the flames of war. Today, the people in the conflict areas are indeed in deep waters, and even the people in the recovered areas are suffering the most cruel impact of the war, so who would not long for the realization of peace!

The post-war world, like a patient recovering from a serious illness, cannot immediately return to health, which is of course natural. For example, countries such as Italy and Greece have all experienced civil wars after the war, but they have all been resolved satisfactorily. Now, only the KMT-CPC conflict in our country has been going on for a year and a half, with fighting and talking, and talking and fighting, without a peaceful resolution. How can our kind people not feel heartbroken? How can our kind people not hope for peace as much as drought hopes for rain clouds? To put it more concretely, today's China is full of dangers and crises. It is really too dangerous and too serious. It is more terrifying and dangerous than the darkest period of military discord during the War of Resistance Against Japan. Even if there is a good doctor who can prescribe medicine according to the symptoms, he will not be able to prescribe the following four prescriptions: (1) restore transportation; (2) develop industry and commerce; (3) reorganize and unify the army; (4) reform politics. However, if domestic peace and unification cannot be realized, then everything is out of the question. So peace is the only wide road to save China.

But why is peace as elusive as a spring dream? Our mediator, General Marshall, with his extraordinary wisdom, rare strategy, and unwavering confidence, ran for peace in China for eleven months, but still failed to bring peace to the Chinese people. However, when he was about to leave, he issued a statement explaining the crux of the transformation of the Chinese situation into its current state, which was the mutual suspicion between the KMT and the CPC. At the same time, he frankly pointed out that the Communist Party "does not trust the leaders of the Kuomintang at all. They seem to believe that all suggestions made by the government are nothing more than attempts to defeat the Communist Party." What General Marshall said is extremely pertinent and can be said to be to the point. We completely agree. And we believe that if the restoration of peace talks is to be successful, then the elimination of suspicion should come first. Sincerity should be valued.

The government's eagerness for peace is even above that of the people. Looking back at the peace talks over the past year, it is not difficult to prove that the government has indeed been sincere about peace talks in the past. Even today, the government is willing to restore peace talks with the CCP, not only with genuine sincerity, but also with great determination. If the attempts in Beijing and Shanghai cannot be successful, then the government will send senior officials to Yan'an, which is even more sufficient to illustrate the government's urgency in expecting the restoration of peace talks. Therefore, the problem with restoring peace talks now lies with the CCP, because the key to war and peace is still in the hands of the CCP. Not only does the CCP show indifference to the restoration of peace talks, but it also insists on its preconditions for restoring peace talks: (1) restore the military positions before January 10 last year; (2) abolish the constitution and dissolve the National Assembly. Regardless of whether the preconditions it proposes are reasonable, the fact that the CCP must propose preconditions for restoring peace talks is a sign of a lack of sincerity. "Without sincerity, there is nothing." Even if peace talks are reluctantly restored, I am afraid that no peace will be discussed? Why bother?

We have always believed that the peaceful resolution of the KMT-CPC problem is the best opportunity today. For the sake of the country and the nation, and also for the sake of the Communist Party itself, the CCP must seize the opportunity in a timely manner and must not miss this valuable opportunity again. The CCP's stubborn style in recent years really needs to be reconsidered. If it continues to be obsessed with its own ideas, it will not only be subject to the accusations and abandonment of the people of the whole country, but also lose the sympathy of various democratic countries. The speech given by Senator Vandenberg, chairman of the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee, in Cleveland the day before yesterday on the 11th, is worthy of the CCP's attention. As the saying goes, "Those who are virtuous will receive much help, while those who are unjust will receive little help." The CCP should especially be vigilant. If the CCP flatly denies the constitution passed by the National Assembly, there is really no reason for it. No matter from which perspective you observe it, this new constitution can be said to be a democratic constitution based on the principles of the Political Consultative Conference. Since the CCP supports the PCC resolutions, why should it oppose the constitution based on the PCC principles? Furthermore, if the CCP insists on restoring the military positions of January 10 last year, it is even more likely to make people suspect the CCP's true intentions. Why doesn't the CCP propose more opinions on the current situation, and only plan for its own territory? We are willing to frankly tell the CCP that these two preconditions are not only unacceptable to the government, but also that our ordinary people will not agree to the CCP's demands.

However, we believe that the problem in China today is not the problem of any one party or faction, but the problem of the entire country and the entire nation. Therefore, we ask all parties to increase their centripetal force towards the nation and the country, and reduce the centrifugal force caused by partisan prejudices. Now is the best time to solve the KMT-CPC problem, so the government, parties, and the people of the whole country should seize the opportunity in a timely manner, adopt the roundtable conference method proposed by Mr. Sun Ke, immediately resume peace talks without conditions, everyone should calm down, put aside all partisan interests and prejudices, review the past, discuss the future, and in the spirit of mutual trust and mutual concession, find a new path for the current difficult situation, so that China can embark on the path of peaceful unification, democratic nation-building as soon as possible.

In short, restoring peace talks should begin with eliminating suspicion, and sincerity should be valued. We advocate the immediate and unconditional restoration of peace talks, but we do not care about the way of peace talks, whether it is a roundtable conference or a party conference, as long as everyone can have a spirit of mutual trust and mutual concession, any difficult problem can be easily solved. The Chinese nation, with its good sense, will peacefully resolve domestic disputes, and we do not believe that it is helpless. Even more, we do not believe that it will perish from now on, because during the War of Resistance Against Japan, we firmly believed that the War of Resistance would be victorious, and we fought for eight years and finally won the final victory. Now, we believe that nation-building will be successful, as long as everyone can put the country first, peace first, and meet with sincerity, we will soon be able to win peace!

### Key Figure in the Nanjing Massacre, Traitor Zheng Fengshi, Under Interrogation; Captured While Serving as an Underground County Magistrate, He Betrayed the Country and Sold Out Patriots; His Crime Is Undeniable, and He Cunningly Claims to Have Been Forced by the Enemy

[Our Suzhou Dispatch] The defendant Zheng Fengshi served as the director of the Civil Affairs Office of the Jiangnan Administrative Office during the period of the occupation. He was then transferred to the position of underground county magistrate of Taicang. In 1944, he was detected and arrested by the enemy's gendarmerie in Changshu. Zheng's will was not firm. During the three months of his imprisonment, he used a pencil to write a book titled "Details of the Crackdown on the Southern Jiangsu Guerrilla Area," one foot high and 32 open, which contained detailed records of the names, duties, addresses, and resumes of various underground workers. In Taicang County alone, he exposed as many as 108 underground KMT members. After completing the book, he presented it to Mi Chuncun, the head of the enemy's gendarmerie, known as the "Wolf of Changshu," in exchange for his personal freedom and preferential treatment. He was then able to take up the position of puppet district chief of the 7th District of Taicang. As a result, the enemy was able to use this book as a basis to launch the horrific Nanjing Massacre. About 20 members of the Taicang local party headquarters were arrested. Countless central underground workers in other places were arrested or killed. After the victory, the families of the victims, Lu Dashou, Chen Jinhua, and others, jointly filed a lawsuit with the Jiangsu High Prosecutor's Office. Zheng was arrested and brought to justice. After several trials by the Suzhou High Court, the newly appointed judge, Chuan Chaoyang, brought him to court again on the 10th for trial, and summoned the plaintiffs and the Changshu enemy gendarmes Lu Chunhua and Jin Shouhui, who had already been sentenced and detained, to testify in court. They jointly claimed that they had been forced to do so by the enemy and that it was not voluntary, and requested the court to give them a lighter sentence. As a result, the court ordered them to be sent back to prison and scheduled a retrial.

[Our Suzhou Dispatch, 12th] Du Zhean, who served as a member of the puppet Reformed Government Council and the puppet Jiangsu Province First District Administrative Inspector, and other puppet positions, fled without a trace after the victory. The Suzhou Office of the Central Bureau of Investigation and Statistics sent a letter to the Suzhou High Prosecutor's Office, requesting that the Investigation Office of the Army Headquarters investigate. After verification, the Suzhou High Prosecutor's Office filed a public prosecution today and will issue an arrest warrant.

### Many Bandits in Zhejiang Province Have Split Up into Smaller Groups; Total Number Is Less Than 2,000; Joint Suppression by Land and Water Is Being Intensified

[Our Hangzhou Dispatch] According to the person in charge of the Zhejiang Provincial Security Command, since the intensification of suppression, there are no more bandit groups of more than 200 people within the province, and the total number is less than 2,000.

### Notorious Bandit in Yueqing Executed

Attempted Escape After Capture, Shot Dead on the Spot

[Our Wenzhou Dispatch] Notorious bandit Chen Bangfa, who had been hiding in Shangjia Yang, Chang'an Township, Yueqing Liushi District, was wanted by the Yongjia Eighth District Administrative Review Commissioner's Office for committing numerous crimes. It is now known that on the night of December 21st of last year, Lou Qinzhang, the captain of the county's criminal police team, led several officers to arrest him. After being escorted to the county and briefly interrogated, he was deemed guilty. The county government, recognizing that the bandit was already wanted by the Eighth District Commissioner's Office, decided to return him for trial. Therefore, at approximately 12:00 PM on the 6th of this month, two officers from the Second Squadron of the Security Police were dispatched to escort the bandit to the steamboat wharf, preparing to transport him by boat to the Yongjia Commissioner's Office for trial. Unexpectedly, while being escorted outside the West Gate and about to disembark, the bandit feigned a need to urinate and seized the opportunity to escape. The two escorting officers, seeing the bandit fleeing, immediately opened fire in pursuit, fatally wounding him. The incident was reported to the Yueqing District Court Procuratorate, which dispatched personnel to verify the death and prepare a coffin for burial.

### Bandit Leader from Haining Escorted to Hangzhou

Linked to Multiple Robberies in Lake Hub

[Our Haining Dispatch] The county police recently uncovered a bandit den in the Zhouwangmiao Township area at the beginning of the month, capturing bandit leader Zhu Zhongliang and five accomplices: Lu Xintian, Chen Baokang, Dai Zhongfei, and Hua Shaoyan. The county government has now received a telegram from the Provincial Security Command stating that bandit leader Zhu Zhongliang and others are linked to a series of major robberies that occurred in Lake Hub, Hangzhou. They were ordered to send someone to the county to take them into custody and escort them to Hangzhou. After uncovering the aforementioned bandit den, the county police, knowing that other bandits such as Chai Yongmao, Wang Wanlin, Chai Yucai, and Zhu Renquan were still at large, continued to deploy a police network to conduct secret searches. Recently, another gang of four bandits was captured in the urban area. The bandits resisted arrest with firearms, but the police officers subdued them with forceful punches. According to their confessions, the bandits, named Wang A'da (from Tou Peng), He Zhenglin (from Tou Peng), Xu A'rong (from this county), and Chen Wenqin (from Pujiang), had committed over ten robberies in areas such as Chang'an, Wangdian, Jiaxing, Jiashan, Tongxiang, Jinshidun, and Xujia'er. Other fugitive accomplices include the Pan Lao Lan brothers, Wang Qichun, Xu A'niu, Chen Baping, Jiang A'wu, Jiang Jinfa, Yu Xiaomao, and Chen Linfu.

### Ferry Robbed in Dongzhang

Self-Defense Team Leader's Guns and Ammunition Confiscated

[Our Changshu Dispatch] Robberies are rampant here as the end of the year approaches. The Dongzhang Township ferry was robbed on the morning of the 9th while carrying passengers.

During the robbery, the robbers ordered the store owner, Xu Desheng, to hand over cash. As a result, 200,000 yuan in cash and over 10 million yuan in counterfeit currency were given to the robbers. In the darkness, the robbers mistakenly believed that it was all legal tender and fled in great excitement.

### Jiangsu Sericulture Management Committee Holds Symposium to Discuss Spring Silkworm Plan; Agricultural Bank Issues 120 Billion in Cocoon Loans

[Our Wuxi Dispatch] The Jiangsu Sericulture Improvement and Management Committee will hold a symposium from the 6th to the 15th of this month to discuss the 36th-year spring silkworm rearing guidance plan. Representatives from silkworm breeding improvement areas in various counties in Jiangnan, as well as silkworm advisory personnel, seed breeding farms, silk factories, cocoon brokers, silkworm seed industry associations, and Agricultural Bank representatives from the Beijing-Shanghai railway line, will all come to Wuxi to participate, review, and improve the sericulture and silk plan. The total amount of spring and autumn silkworm seeds for various farms this year will be over 10,000, with the price of each sheet of seeds set at 5,500 to 7,000 yuan. However, it is believed that the failure of the sericulture industry is largely due to the failure to establish silkworm rearing guidance centers universally, and the low quality of silkworm cocoons produced is unprecedented in decades. The current spring seed distribution is tentatively set at 600,000 sheets, with each unit collectively incubating 10,000 sheets, requiring the establishment of 60 incubation centers. 300,000 sheets of young silkworms will be collectively reared, with each unit rearing 500 sheets, requiring the establishment of 600 collective rearing centers. Currently, the rural economy is bankrupt, and the Central Agricultural Bank has drafted a loan implementation plan to assist farmers in production. Farmers in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces engaged in mulberry cultivation, silkworm rearing, cocoon drying, and silk reeling can obtain low-interest loans totaling 240 billion yuan, with cocoon collection loans totaling 120 billion yuan, Jiangsu and Zhejiang sericulture loans totaling 27.2 billion yuan, Jiangsu sericulture production loans totaling 4 billion yuan, cooperative cocoon drying loans totaling 1.5 billion yuan, and collective incubation and rearing of young silkworms and mulberry garden equipment loans totaling 900 million yuan, all repayable in installments over three years. Currently, there are 108 seed breeding farm units and 50 guidance units in Jiangsu Province, and it has been decided to expand them and establish 500 collective rearing groups to universally guide silkworm rearing work and complete the path to recovery.

### Reorganizing the Scenic Yandang Mountains; Management Office to Resume Next Month

[Our Wenzhou Dispatch] The Yandang Mountains, one of the famous mountains in southeastern China, is located east of Yueqing, facing the sea to the southeast, bordering Yongjia to the west, and reaching Huangyan to the north, stretching through nine townships, including Dajing and Yandang, covering an area of 180 li in circumference. The natural scenery is unparalleled, with 120 unique peaks that change shape with every step. The Longqiu Waterfall is misty and rainy in all seasons, and there is a lake on the mountain top, covering tens of acres, which visitors praise as a spectacle. The late Jian Tao Uncle has a saying, "It is difficult to write about Longqiu, traveling to Yandang in the lower reaches is a waste." The entire mountain has 444 natural scenic spots, and other man-made features include temples, Taoist buildings, pavilions, and ancient pagodas that dot the landscape. The Yandang Mountain Construction Committee and Yandang Mountain Scenic Area Management Office were originally established to carry out construction, and long-distance telephones were installed and automobile branch roads were built. At that time, visitors from all over the world came to visit in an endless stream. However, with the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, everything came to a standstill, causing the magnificent mountains to lose their luster. At the end of last year, Provincial Chairman Shen Honglie inspected various counties in southern Zhejiang and passed through the area. Recognizing that the scenic spots and historical sites of the Yandang Mountains urgently needed to be renovated, he instructed Yueqing County Magistrate Chen Jie to restore the Yandang Mountain Scenic Area Management Office as soon as possible. It is now known that the county magistrate, upon receiving the instructions, has begun preparing everything and has decided to restore the establishment of the Management Office on the first of next month.

### Picture of a Bleak Year-End in Jin City

— Chengdu Dispatch by Our Special Correspondent Zhou Xueduan

Undercurrents Envelop Chengdu

Chengdu—Jin City—is a famous historical capital in Southwest China. Those who have visited Chengdu will surely cherish deep and beautiful memories. Most people believe that among modern Chinese cities, only Peiping, Chengdu, and Suzhou can represent typical Chinese culture. Peiping represents the desolate and tragic, magnificent, and expansive culture of Hebei. Suzhou represents the exquisite, ingenious, charming, and graceful beauty of Jiangnan. Chengdu combines both, maintaining beauty amidst desolation and profound majesty amidst charm. This is a consensus among those who have lingered in Chengdu.

The Chengdu Plain is the most affluent area of the "Land of Abundance." The people of Chengdu have long been accustomed to a life of ease, prosperity, and tranquility, cultivating habits of enjoyment, optimism, and leisure. The eight years of the War of Resistance against Japan, with all the baptism of gunfire, could not wash away the tranquil style of the Chengdu people. However, the "headwinds" and "inflation" brought about by post-war recovery, along with various unfavorable storms and winds, swept away all the peaceful and comfortable realities of Chengdu people's lives. As the year comes to an end, winter remains, the weather is freezing, and the north wind brings with it soaring prices, the collapse of industry and commerce, the bankruptcy of culture, and various dark clouds and chilling winds of social decay. The bleak end of the year in Jin City is no longer the era of "Jin City's silk and bamboo music, filling the air, half carried by the river breeze, half rising into the clouds." Chengdu in winter has been enveloped in the dark undercurrents and chilling fog of chaos and recession.

Three Winds of Winter

In winter, along with the Siberian cold current, the "inflation" and "headwinds" that simultaneously plague the entire country blow into Chengdu. Prices have been soaring like runaway horses in the past month. Gold, which leads prices, has broken through the 200,000 mark to 350,000, while rice has risen from 50,000 to 80,000. For a time, the market was in chaos, with prices rising in a straight line, the government powerless, and the common people terrified. It is said that this inflation is man-made. Speakers point out that gold bars are piling up in the vaults of major banks in Chengdu, and rice is piling up in granaries. However, those who speak, speak; those who inflate, inflate. Speculators are seen smiling broadly, while the poor are crying with hunger and cold. Fortunately, it is a world of shifting situations; the poor will starve to death from hunger and cold, no big deal!

Following closely on the heels of inflation, a series of social problems has arisen. These are the new and unique three winds of Chengdu—the "suicide wind," the "free eating wind," and the "theft wind." Low-salaried civil servants under the pressure of high prices, the unemployed, and the poor are forced by life's circumstances. The kindhearted choose the first path, while the strong are forced to take risks and embark on the latter two paths. The first, the "suicide wind," where suicide becomes a trend, is the most tragic social phenomenon and the most serious social problem. Since the beginning of winter, suicide cases in Chengdu society have been endless, almost several cases a day. The suicides are mostly petty civil servants, unemployed youths, and poor and sick common people. The reasons for suicide are difficulties in making a living, family disputes, marriage problems, etc. There have also been several cases of suicide due to landlords raising rents. This "suicide wind" has aroused social attention and concern. According to the analysis of sociologist Liu Shichuan, former president of Qilu University, this is another type of mental illness resulting from the long-term social chaos and extreme disappointment of people's hearts during the eight years of the War of Resistance against Japan. It cannot be stopped unless the social economy is fundamentally improved. "Free eating wind" is a special product of Chengdu society these days, also known as "eating from the rich," which means collectively eating without paying. In recent days, this trend has been fully displayed by unemployed soldiers. Around New Year's Day, hundreds of unemployed soldiers, responding to a call, went to major restaurants in groups to "eat for free." Restaurants frequented include Shengli and Rongsheng. This trend is now being suppressed by the Sichuan-Kangding Pacification Headquarters and may be slightly curbed. "Theft wind" is a common phenomenon in various cities. Since Chengdu entered winter, security has been strengthened, but the theft wind has become even more rampant. Statistics show that more than 600 theft cases were reported last month. For a provincial capital in Sichuan with a population of less than one million, this is a shocking figure.

Industry and Commerce on the Verge of Collapse

In the rush of the end of the year, all industries are withering. Accompanying "inflation" to Chengdu is the "headwind." This year, Chengdu's industry and commerce are suffering because Sichuan's rural areas have been overburdened for eight years, and the people's strength has been exhausted. In addition, last year, 114 counties in Sichuan Province suffered widespread drought and floods. Furthermore, they must bear the burden of requisitioning 9 million piculs of farmland grain this year. The rural economy is on the verge of total collapse, affecting the survival of the entire industry and commerce of Sichuan. At the same time, foreign goods are dumped, and local goods cannot survive. Chengdu's industry and commerce, which are just budding and growing, are like candles in the wind and frost on the tiles, in a precarious state.

First is Chengdu's industry. Chengdu is famous throughout the country for its handicrafts. For example, "Shu brocade," which is as famous as Xiang embroidery, was sold to Peiping and Tianjin in the north and shipped to India and Burma in the south before the war. It was especially loved and praised by the British and Americans. Currently, it is showing signs of decline. According to a survey after the beginning of winter, the number of weaving households in the city has decreased from more than 3,000 during the war to more than 2,000, and the number of weavers has decreased from more than 100,000 to more than 60,000. Sales are also particularly sluggish. In addition, among the new-style factories in Chengdu, there were 68 during the war, but only 44 remain this winter. The large-scale Shenxin Yarn Factory, Yuhua Yarn Factory, Fuhua Silk Factory, Fuchang Bristle Factory, Sichuan Machinery Company, etc., have become a trend, and the entire industry is sluggish.

Chengdu's commerce was originally the distribution center for Northwest Sichuan, serving as a hub for Shaanxi, Gansu, Kangding, and Tibet. After the war, due to the smooth flow of goods from Shanghai and Hong Kong, trade flourished for a time. Since the beginning of winter, due to fluctuations in commodity prices and the exhaustion of people's purchasing power, transactions have been at a standstill. At the same time, Shanghai's interest rates are very high, and idle funds are concentrated in Shanghai. As a result, Chengdu has experienced an unprecedented shortage of funds, the tightest it has been in ten years. Therefore, the "headwind" swept through, and a series of silver shops, money houses, and large stores closed down, disrupting the entire financial market and triggering a major financial crisis. The aftershocks are still lingering today.

With the assistance of provincial and municipal authorities, the business community of Chengdu barely made it through the solar New Year. However, the Lunar New Year, which follows closely behind, is imminent. This is a touchstone for the survival of all industries and businesses. People in the business community say, "Passing the Lunar New Year is like encountering the gates of hell!"

The Tragedy of Culture

These days are precisely when the "June-December War," which occurs twice a year in Sichuan's education sector, is about to unfold. Looking around at the current education and culture in Chengdu, it is truly heartrending! Chengdu was originally the cultural center of Southwest China. During the war, it once had ten famous universities and was known as the "cultural city" of the country. Newspapers and bookstores also flourished and prospered. But today, whether it is education, culture, schools, newspapers, or bookstores, they are all barely surviving in sorrow. Chengdu's culture is on a downward trend!

In Chengdu's education sector, the number of universities has been reduced from ten to six last year, and the current four universities can only accommodate more than 2,000 students per semester. The number of people who are unable to attend university is estimated to be more than 20,000. This is a serious problem for education. Moreover, the entire education funding in Sichuan Province is extremely inadequate. Last year, the education restoration fund was 800 million yuan, but the central government only allocated 450 million yuan, and the Finance Department only allocated 250 million yuan. The remaining amount was all deducted. Liu Mingyang, the Director of the Department of Education, has resigned in protest. Currently, the principals of all provincial and county middle schools in Sichuan are planning to resign en masse, and Chengdu's middle school students will also hold a large-scale parade to request increased education funding and independent management of education funds. For the sake of the young students' desire to learn and to help the youth who are unable to attend school, the current situation of education is heartbreaking.

Under the high prices, Chengdu's newspaper industry has felt unable to sustain itself. Last month, in order to increase the wages of its workers, the city's 19 newspapers jointly issued a painful appeal, expressing their heartfelt sorrow and requesting government loans, otherwise they would all cease publication. However, even if they were to obtain a small amount of loans, how could they alleviate the urgent needs of the future? Colleagues in the newspaper industry say that not only will the industry and commerce have to overcome difficulties this year, but the newspaper industry will also have to overcome difficulties. If the newspaper industry, which leads society, is in such a situation, how can one not be saddened by the future of Chengdu's culture!

Before the war, there were more than 260 new and used bookstores in Chengdu. Since the beginning of winter, only 140 remain. Most of them rely solely on low-level erotic novels to maintain their business, but even so, they are still on the verge of collapse.

This is the overall face of Chengdu's cultural circle. In the freezing winter, a tour of Chengdu's cultural garden reveals that it is filled with disappointment, sadness, and pain. The trend is degeneration and decline, and the bright future is obscured by dark undercurrents and chilling fog. Is Chengdu's culture, which was once brilliant, going to decline like this? The friends in Chengdu's cultural circle are not willing to accept this. They want to struggle in a difficult environment, and human effort will overcome fate. This is a ray of hope for the future of Chengdu's cultural circle.

In the long, cold winter, when will spring arrive? These days are the New Year's Day holiday. Chengdu's climate is bright, warm, and beautiful. People look up at the towering monument and the magnificent statue of the unknown hero. They flow through the quiet Wangjianglou Park and the beautiful Huaxi Dam. This ancient city, blessed with outstanding people, will eventually transition from the bleak end of the year to spring.

### The United States Must Maintain Necessary Armaments and Cooperate to Uphold Legitimate Peace: Byrnes Emphasizes This Point in His Last Public Speech Before Resignation; U.S. Control of Atomic Policy Unlikely to Change

[Our Report] San Francisco, December 12 (Broadcast): Byrnes stated in his farewell speech in Cleveland that he believes that countries around the world can achieve a just peace through cooperative efforts. He urged the U.S. government to continue to implement its firm policy towards the Soviet Union. Byrnes said: "We must not assume that efforts for peace are hopeless simply because a method of reconciling opinions cannot be immediately found."

[Reuters, Cleveland, December 11] U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes delivered his last public speech before resigning at the International Politics Symposium co-hosted by Time Magazine and the Cleveland Council on World Affairs today. He expressed great confidence in completing the establishment of a just peace, but also argued that the United States must maintain the necessary military strength to fulfill its due responsibilities in the task of jointly maintaining legitimate peace. He pointed out that while force cannot create justice, in the current imperfect world, force and reason can both influence international decisions. Byrnes further emphasized the need to establish the proper place of law in international relations so that no country can force another to accept its views, and that neither the United States nor any other country should have the power to rule the world. The current power relations between the major powers prevent any one country from unilaterally ruling the world, and any attempt to do so would seriously disrupt the entire United Nations organization. Byrnes did not mention his resignation or Marshall's new position, and only made a vague criticism of the Soviet Union's attitude in the United Nations atomic energy debate.

Byrnes, referring to the Soviet Union's insistence on immediately discussing the entire issue of disarmament, said that the United States advocates first discussing the control of atomic weapons because this weapon is the most destructive. He believes that if an agreement can be reached on this matter, it will not be difficult to reach agreements on the control of other weapons and the reduction of armaments. Byrnes expressed dissatisfaction with the completion of the peace treaties with the former German satellite countries, believing that the time for discussing German and Austrian peace treaties will be greatly facilitated as a result. He believes that the progress made by the United States in diplomacy over the past year is due to the consistent foreign policy of the entire country. Byrnes also said that economic difficulties, famine, and disease are the main causes of political instability. Therefore, in order to maintain peace, the economic and social factors that induce aggressive warfare should be eliminated. The United States must continue to provide assistance to certain countries, and must do its best to support the International Bank, the International Monetary Fund, and the U.S. Export-Import Bank, which specializes in foreign loans. The United States should also firmly implement its policy of mutual trade principles and the international trade organization charter it has proposed to expand U.S. and world trade, prevent the emergence of economic blocs, promote world prosperity, and thoroughly eliminate the factors of political instability.

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, December 11] Observers with the right qualifications here recently stated that since Baruch, the U.S. representative to the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission, resigned, the U.S. atomic policy may be more "flexible," but it is unlikely to undergo large-scale changes. Baruch's achievements and the suggestions he put forward have been highly praised. Many people believe that Senator Austin's succession to Baruch's vacancy is well deserved. Although commentators have different views on the reasons for Baruch's resignation, most believe that Baruch's move was a reasonable step because since his mission has been accomplished, the responsibility for negotiations should naturally be borne by Zorin, the U.S. representative to the Security Council.

### Regarding the Corfu Channel Incident: Albania's Reply to Britain Published; Rejects British Accusations and Refuses Compensation and Apology

[Reuters, New York, December 11] Cadogan, the British representative to the United Nations Security Council, sent a letter to the United Nations Secretariat yesterday, presenting the British accusation against Albania. Albania's reply to the British protest was also included in the letter. The content of the reply was published for the first time. Cadogan's letter stated that the British government believes that Albania's reply is completely unsatisfactory, so the British government instructed it to submit the dispute to the Security Council as soon as possible in accordance with Article 35 of the United Nations Charter. The Albanian reply was delivered to British Ambassador to Yugoslavia, Peirse, on December 21, in which it expressed deep regret over the incident in October in which two British destroyers struck mines in the Corfu Channel, resulting in the deaths of 44 sailors. However, at the same time, it solemnly refuted the accusations made by the British protest letter, pointing out that the accusations are inconsistent with the Albanian people's repeated expressions of peaceful aspirations and the Albanian government's friendly policy towards Britain or other nations. It also stated that it is regrettable that the British government's policy towards Albania has not always been guided by peaceful purposes. For example, the British government supports the unreasonable demands of Greek imperialist elements for a part of Albanian territory. Britain's firm opposition to Albania, which is also an allied country, joining the United Nations organization, the British government's unfriendly attitude towards Albania in discussions on peace treaties, and the British government's refusal to establish normal diplomatic relations with the Albanian government all indicate Britain's unfriendliness towards Albania. Even worse, Britain has directly violated Albanian sovereignty. For example, two British warships entered Albanian territorial waters in May 1946 without permission. A similar incident occurred on December 22. On October 23, British aircraft invaded Albania again. On November 12, a British fleet formed in a combat formation passed along the Albanian south coast. The next day, British warships fired machine guns into the air outside Saranda. The Albanian government had previously appealed to the United Nations for attention to these "illegal acts." In the incident on October 22, in which two British warships were injured, the British warships' passage through the northern Corfu Channel seriously violated the principle of good faith passage. Regarding the British accusation that Albania laid mines in the Corfu Channel, knew that other countries had laid mines there, or knew that there were mines there, it is completely unfounded and slanders the peaceful will of the Albanian government and people. The Albanian government believes that if this matter is indeed malicious, it must have been done by someone who intended to undermine friendly relations between Britain and Albania. The Albanian government can present the following facts to support this, that is, Greek and other countries' ships often intrude into Albanian southern territorial waters without permission. The Albanian government's reply continued to say that the Albanian government's suggestion to send a mixed committee to investigate the matter was entirely sincere, with the purpose of resolving the matter in a spirit of friendly cooperation. Finally, the Albanian reply stated that since the points pointed out by the British government are completely unfounded, it cannot accept the request to compensate the families of the deceased British crew members or apologize to Britain.

### The United States Will Adopt a New Policy in the Far East to Prevent the Continued Spread of Communism; It Will Spend $2 Billion Annually on Relief

[Our Special Correspondent, Washington, December 12] The famous American news magazine "World Report" stated that the United States will take practical steps to prevent the spread of communism in countries outside the United States. It is said that the rampant communism in the East has aroused great attention from the U.S. authorities. The new Congress will give it careful consideration. In China, Korea, and Japan, the deterioration of the economic situation has further facilitated the development of communism, threatening true democracy. Currently, the United States has three options: (1) the United States withdraws from Europe and Asia; (2) continues its current policy; (3) adopts a new policy. Informed sources say that the United States will adopt a third new policy, providing a large amount of materials and food to countries in need of relief. In this regard, the United States will spend $2 billion annually.

### Lloyd George's Foresight: U.S. Releases Secret Files

[Central News Agency, Washington, December 11, United Press] The U.S. State Department today released secret files regarding the 1919 Paris Peace Conference, which showed that British Prime Minister Lloyd George warned U.S. President Wilson and French Premier Clemenceau at the time that after the Great War, the Soviet Union would rise as a powerful and ambitious country, creating Slavic nation-states, and may eventually control 160 million people in the world. According to a part of the documents, after World War I, British and American politicians seemed to be as concerned about the rapid growth of communism as they are today, but their opinions differed on what threat the Bolshevik Soviet Union would pose to the world. Wilson believed that Lloyd George was overly pessimistic about the threat of the Soviet Union and overly optimistic about the Soviet Union's ability to develop its socialist economy.

### Welles Analyzes the Far East Situation

[Central News Agency, Washington, December 12, United Press] Former U.S. Undersecretary of State Welles broadcast that the British and Dutch governments' decision to grant independence to India and Burma and autonomy to Indonesia is extremely bright when looking at the overall situation. In the past few months, the long and arduous civil war in China is more likely to increase than to be eliminated. The key to peace in East Asia lies in the final overall understanding between Washington and Moscow. Before this understanding is reached, there is no reason to expect improvement.

### Norway Will Reply to the Soviet Note; Swedish Circles Express Concern

[Agence France-Presse, Norwegian Capital, December 11] Regarding the Soviet note to the Norwegian government requesting the revision of the 1920 Spitsbergen Treaty, a radio station here reported that the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs will submit a reply within a few days.

[Agence France-Presse, Swedish Capital, December 11] It is rumored that the Soviet Union requested the revision of the international treaty concluded in 1920, in which Norway ceded the Spitsbergen Islands (located in the Arctic Ocean north of Norway) to the Soviet Union as a military base. All Swedish newspapers are paying close attention to this matter. "Kungen Times" stated: "Everyone has different ideas about Spitsbergen. The countries that signed the 1920 treaty, except for Italy and Japan, are all members of the United Nations. Why not let the United Nations resolve this matter?"

### Indonesian Cabinet Established; Chinese Xie Guochang Appointed Minister of Justice

[Central News Agency, Batavia, December 12, Special Dispatch] The Cabinet of Eastern Indonesia has been formally established, with Prime Minister Nazimoeddin. The Cabinet's goal is to seek the rapid restoration of Indonesia. The Cabinet has nine members. Xie Guochang, a Chinese, is the Minister of Justice, and Mr. Holm Link, a Dutchman, is the Minister of Finance. The Prime Minister also serves as the Minister of Economy. There is no Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the Cabinet.

### Marshal Montgomery Returns to London after Completing Mission to Moscow - Soviet Suspicion of Anglo-American Military Cooperation Eliminated

[United Press, London, November 11] Chief of the Imperial General Staff, Montgomery, having completed his five-day visit to Moscow, returned by plane today and went directly to the War Office. The British Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Roberts, also returned on Montgomery's special plane to report to the Foreign Office on the success of Montgomery's visit. Britain and the Soviet Union originally signed a twenty-year military alliance treaty in 1942. Foreign Secretary Bevin suggested extending it for fifty years, but the Soviet Union did not agree. Montgomery's visit this time has greatly reduced Soviet suspicions of Anglo-American military cooperation. The United States is pleased to hear that the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union are developing a closer military relationship. Agence France-Presse reports that after Montgomery returned to London, he told reporters: "My meeting with Marshal Stalin went very well. Marshal Stalin is as healthy as ever. I am very satisfied with this trip, and I am particularly impressed with the Soviet Red Army."

### Chinese, British, and American Consuls and Viet Minh Discuss Evacuation Issues - Establishing "Non-Combat Zones" to Avoid Civilian Casualties

[Agence France-Presse, Kunming, November 12] The Viet Minh radio broadcast today that the consuls of China, Britain, and the United States in Hanoi are discussing with the Deputy Ministers of Interior and Foreign Affairs of the Viet Minh government the evacuation of foreigners from dangerous areas, especially overseas Chinese and Indians, and the establishment of "non-combat zones" to avoid civilian casualties. The meeting was held on the night of the 9th of this month near the front line. The Viet Minh representatives presented a lengthy memorandum and numerous documents, and the three consuls relayed the opinions of the Viet Minh side to their respective authorities.

### International Emergency Food Council Announces Rice Allocation for First Half of Year - China to Receive 245,000 Tons

[Reuters, Washington, November 11] The International Emergency Food Council announced today the amount of rice allocated to various countries for the first half of 1947, totaling 1,682,000 tons, of which China will receive 245,000 tons, India 410,000 tons, Malaya 225,000 tons, Ceylon 200,000 tons, the Dutch East Indies 100,000 tons, and the Philippines 95,000 tons. The Food Council pointed out that due to the lack of rice supply sources, the approved allocation is less than half of the amount requested by each country. The largest rice exporting country during the same period is Burma, with 800,000 tons, followed by Siam. In addition to supplying 375,000 tons of white rice to China, Siamese merchants are also willing to supply another 25,000 tons of white rice to China.

### Siamese Rice Shipped to Shanghai

### Tumultuous Political Situation in Japan

[United Press, Tokyo, November 12] The Yoshida Cabinet, which emerged on May 22nd last year with the aim of revitalizing Japan, appears to be on the verge of resigning en masse in the middle of this week, as an initial step toward expanding its political base and regaining power. It is rumored that Yoshida himself believes that this measure is the best way to promote the national revival of Japan. It is said that the new reorganized cabinet will still be led by Yoshida and his predecessor Shidehara, and its lineup will include several members of the Social Democratic Party, compromising with the left wing, but policy concessions will be limited, only to gain the favor of certain factions of the labor political organizations under the leadership of the Democratic Socialist Party and the Communist Party that are designated as "extreme reactionaries." Although various left-wing groups are taking advantage of this to publicize and mobilize all their forces to launch labor strikes in Japan, which will greatly hinder Japan's post-war production.

### Volcano Erupts in the Philippines - Lava Flows, Black Smoke Soars - Philippine Government Takes Necessary Measures to Prevent Any Eventuality

[United Press, Manila, November 12] Residents of two cities at the foot of Mount Mayon have begun to evacuate, while lava flows down the slopes from the crater. After inspecting the site, President Roxas announced that there was no reason to fear unless there were unexpected developments, but government agencies and the Red Cross were prepared to depart for relief in the event of a violent eruption.

[United Press, On an Air Force Weather Plane over Mount Mayon, November 11] Mount Mayon is boiling, spewing smoke and lava, and southern Luzon within a 100-mile radius was shrouded in dark red smoke today.

### Japan's Reparations Problem (Part II)

— Special Correspondent of This Newspaper in Tokyo, Chuan Junyi

Since the release of the Pauley final report, the Japanese government has held cabinet meetings every day to discuss countermeasures. It is said that the Japanese government's countermeasures hope to ease the restrictions on industrial productivity and raise it to the level of 1937, when the Sino-Japanese War broke out. It is said that the plan hopes to maintain the standard of living of the Japanese people at the level of 1930. If this level can be maintained, it will still be necessary to import 3 billion yen worth of necessities such as food, clothing raw materials, petroleum rubber, etc. every year, while the export capacity, such as raw silk and other items, is only 1.1 billion yen. The difference is still less than 2 billion, which must be compensated by importing raw materials and semi-finished products for processing and then exporting them. Therefore, industrial production capacity must be maintained at the level of 1937.

Impact of Implementing Reparations on Japan

If, according to the Pauley plan, all 100,000 items of reparations are removed, and calculated with a population of 80 million, what will be the size of Japan's economy in a few years? The views of influential people here on this issue are as follows:

(1) If it is necessary to maintain the living standard of 1930, calculated at the price level of 1936, it will be necessary to import 830 million yen worth of food, 1.05 billion yen worth of clothing, and 1.52 billion yen worth of industrial raw materials and other items, totaling approximately 3.4 billion yen. However, Japan must rely on foreign merchant ships to import these items, and the freight is approximately 200 million yen, so the import amount will reach 3.5 billion yen.

(2) The goods exchanged for this 3.5 billion yen are 1.1 billion yen worth of iron and fiber products, 450 million yen worth of machinery and metal products, 300 million yen worth of chemical products and medicines, and 850 million yen worth of raw silk, aquatic products, ceramics, glassware, and other items. Among them, only 800 million yen worth of raw silk and glassware can be produced with domestic raw materials, and the raw materials for all other items must be imported from abroad.

(3) In addition to 9 million spindles for textile machines (including domestic consumption), a minimum amount of processing equipment is also necessary for other sectors such as ironmaking, machinery, and chemical industries. However, because basic industries such as ferrous and non-ferrous metals and caustic soda have been restricted, these products must be imported in large quantities. A portion of the consumption of artificial ivory and tar products, alcohol, and medicines must also be imported from abroad.

The limit on textile machines is two-thirds of the required amount, and chemical products, machinery, and metal products will also be restricted. The complete removal of the steel ball industry, tar industry, alcohol industry, and artificial ivory industry will inevitably cause considerable difficulties for the mechanical and chemical industries.

After the reparations plan is implemented, the scale of industry will inevitably be restricted, and the export sector will also be limited. Therefore, the population that the industrial sector can support will inevitably shrink, and a considerable number of unemployed people will occur. If the population is calculated at 80 million, the maximum number of people that agricultural income can absorb in the future will be no more than 15 million. If the number of employed people in the 80 million population is calculated at 36.8 million, 5 million people will be absorbed by commerce, 5.8 million people will be employed in other sectors, and 10 million people will remain, who should be absorbed by the industrial sector.

Washington Will Make the Final Decision

Washington has not yet made a concrete decision on Pauley's final report on reparations for Japan. It is currently being revised by various experts. Pauley once limited Japan's industrial level to the level between 1926 and 1930, and it seems possible to revise it to the level between 1928 and 1934. The Allied Supreme Commander's Headquarters here has repeatedly requested Washington to adopt a lenient policy regarding reparations for Japan. The Japanese government's proposal to maintain the economic level of 1930 has been submitted to the General Headquarters for forwarding to Washington. Regarding the General Headquarters' attitude towards the issue of reparations for Japan, officials on that side stated: (1) They have made every effort to advocate establishing a policy that is sufficient to allow Japanese industry to continue to exist. (2) The General Headquarters is very familiar with all issues and Japan's efforts for economic reconstruction. (3) The reparations policy for Japan was determined in the past, but the situation has changed since then, so it should be revised. Many such changes have occurred recently, especially the changes that have occurred in the Japanese industry.

How to Dispose of the Chinese Portion

Finally, I would like to say a word about the disposal of the portion of reparations from Japan that China should receive. It is said that out of the 12 million tons of reparations materials, China can receive 3.6 million tons. The issues of removal, transportation, and the technical issues of resuming work after repatriation are all worthy of study. Certain chemical industries, such as the caustic soda industry, cannot be re-established after removal. There are already several precedents in Japan itself. During the war, some factories were evacuated from Nagoya to Nagano to avoid air raids, and the loss of equipment reached nearly half. Even if all technical and transportation issues are resolved, and they can be immediately installed and resumed work after being moved back, it is still a question whether the products can compete with the products of other advanced countries with lower prices and better quality under the current high production cost situation. Except for certain important industries where the technical, transportation, and installation restoration issues can be resolved by themselves, it is also not unworthy of careful consideration to temporarily leave certain industries in Japan and use Japanese technology and cheap labor to continue operations under strict supervision. Otherwise, it will still evolve into the phenomenon of stopping work upon receipt, which is not only a loss for China itself, but also a waste of the overall productive capacity of East Asia.

### Heated Discussion on Eating Out - Threshold for Taxing Banquets Decided to be Changed to 5,000 Yuan - Opinions Divided on Classification Issue, No Result Reached - General Assembly Continues Discussion This Morning

[Report from This Newspaper] The Municipal Council held its sixth meeting yesterday afternoon to discuss five financial proposals, among which the issue of the threshold for levying banquet taxes and the levy of different taxes for restaurants classified into A and B categories caused heated debate, lasting for two hours. As a result, the threshold for banquet taxes was passed at 5,000 yuan through voting, but the issue of classification remained unresolved. Subsequently, four opinions were proposed, but none received a majority of votes through voting, and the general assembly will continue the discussion this morning. The four opinions are as follows:

(1) Threshold Issue: The original threshold was 3,000 yuan, but the Finance Committee resolved to change it to 5,000 yuan. Zhou Lianze proposed raising the threshold from 5,000 yuan to 10,000 yuan, which was seconded by several councilors, but some other councilors still insisted on maintaining 5,000 yuan, and the majority passed.

(2) Classification Issue: Director of the Finance Bureau Gu Chunfan said: According to the central government's regulations, a banquet tax is levied on each table with a fixed price. If the restaurant side disputes this, arguing that Western food does not refer to each table, but rather each customer, and therefore should not be taxed, and that Chinese food must have ten people and cost more than 100,000 yuan to be considered a "table," then the taxes collected by the city government will be very few, so it is necessary to establish a method. If the tax law does not have accurate regulations, it is impossible to prevent leakage or embezzlement. The current standard set by the city government is: Any restaurant whose normal business mostly exceeds 25,000 yuan each time will be classified as A grade, and a banquet tax of 20% will be levied; any restaurant whose business is mostly below 25,000 yuan each time will be classified as B grade, and a tax of 10% will be levied. However, the bureau does not impose rigid regulations and must also consider whether the restaurant's prices are cheap. If there are B-grade restaurants with pricing standards similar to A-grade restaurants, they will still be classified as A grade. Conversely, A-grade restaurants with low prices can be classified as B grade. The purpose of this is to benefit the citizens.

Councilors expressed different opinions on this case: Zhu Wende, Lu Yinchu, Fei Shusheng, Lu Shidao, Wu Zhengjue, and others did not approve of grading, believing it to be unreasonable and unfair. Wu Zhengjue also said that the central government did not stipulate grading, and this case should not be discussed at all. Discussing it would be illegal. The general assembly voted on whether to shelve the case, but the majority did not approve. Lu Shidao said that this case violates the central government's laws and regulations. It should not be graded now, and the discussion should be postponed until the central government amends the laws and regulations.

Some People Eat the Decoration, Tao Baichuan Advocates Grading

However, Tao Baichuan advocated grading, believing that many people in the world are willing to spend more money. They eat the decoration, or the food is superior, or the chef has a good reputation, and they do not care about paying more taxes. In fact, many large restaurants are not affected by high taxes and still make money. Qu Cheng also agreed that there should be grades, believing that many wealthy people are willing to go to A-grade restaurants and pay more. Let them go, otherwise they will feel sorry for their guests when they invite them!

Deputy Speaker Xu Jiqing also said that the issue of eating out must be discussed in detail and agreed to grading because citizens have different economic strengths. Li Wenjie proposed a compromise, drawing the attention of colleagues, advocating grading, but with attached conditions, that is, if A-grade operators have less than 25,000 yuan per transaction, they should be taxed according to the B-grade standard, that is, at 10%.

As a result, four opinions were put to a vote: (1) Agree to A and B grades, (2) Disagree to grading, (3) According to Councilor Li's opinion, that is, A-grade operators with less than 25,000 yuan will be taxed at 10%, (4) According to Councilor Lu's proposal, no grading will be done currently, and a decision will be made after the central government amends the laws and regulations. As a result, each opinion did not receive a majority, and the general assembly could not make a decision and will continue the discussion today.

### Clubs Do Not Pay Taxes - Director Claims It Is Due to Some Kind of Relationship

When Wu Zhengjue inquired as to why the New Life Club was not taxed, and what the tax situation was for refreshments, Director Gu replied: There are more than just the New Life Club in this city that do not pay taxes. Due to some kind of relationship, the Finance Bureau's authority cannot reach them, but it has repeatedly contacted the club authorities to pay taxes. According to the old tax law, refreshments that are considered luxury items are all taxable, but according to the central government's new tax law, they do not need to be taxed. This point can also be discussed and decided by the Municipal Council. Deputy Speaker Xu made a supplementary statement: In the former concession era, all foreign clubs did not pay taxes because many clubs were indeed places for three or five private individuals to rest, but now clubs have become public places, so he advocated that all clubs, regardless of Chinese or foreign, should be taxed as restaurants.

### Startled Several Times in One Night - People of All Kinds in Hotels Investigated Rooms - Government Should Pay Attention to the Safety and Tranquility of Travelers - Resolution to Levy Hotel Tax at 5%

[Report from This Newspaper] The case of "The current hotel tax increases the burden on travelers, hinders hotel business, and is not based on law. It is proposed to send a letter to the city government to stop collecting it immediately to alleviate the people's difficulties," which was reviewed by the Finance Committee of the Municipal Council, was also presented to the general assembly yesterday for lengthy discussion. Speaker Pan retired from the speaker's seat and formally expressed his opinion for the first time: Although the hotel tax is collected at 5%, which is a very small amount, the hotel industry representatives have repeatedly petitioned the Municipal Council, stating their difficulties, and the business is indeed slow. This is because some travelers, relying on special forces, refuse to pay the tax, forcing the hotel authorities to pay on their behalf. Some hotels even pay millions of yuan on their behalf. Hotels became a deformed business during the enemy and puppet period, becoming the main base for illegal activities such as smoking and gambling, so it was appropriate to collect special taxes. However, it is worth everyone's attention whether the hotel industry should be regarded as a special business now. There are two things that hotels feel most painful about: (1) The accounting staff of general hotels cannot control the waiters. After offending the travelers, the hotel owners have no power to manage them, and the waiters take charge. Does the government have a way to help solve this problem? (2) In terms of inspection, there are people in uniform, people in plain clothes, and inexplicably personnel in the hotels every day, at no fixed time, no fixed period, and no fixed shift, checking the guests' rooms late at night. For example, if a traveler is drinking alcohol in the room by himself, the inspectors will say that this is an illegal act, and say, "If you want to drink, you can go to Wang Baohe"! Situations like this treat the common people as non-human beings, so unless absolutely necessary, no one dares to come as a traveler. This shows that politics needs to be rectified from the bottom up. In fact, if the travelers' lives are stable, they are willing to pay more taxes, so I am making this appeal on their behalf. While the government collects taxes, it must also consider the people's suffering.

Mayor Wu stood up and declared that the city government has indeed thought about the safety and tranquility of travelers and is trying to improve it, but (1) in terms of inspection, there are not as many as six types. The Garrison Command has been asked to jointly inspect with the police station once. In the former concession era, hotels completely became the main base for smoking and gambling, and the atmosphere was corrupted, but now it is still necessary to maintain good social customs, and the city government and everyone should be responsible. (2) The owners and waiters are also labor-management disputes. I have met with both labor and management sides once each, and I have earnestly warned the labor side that their request for year-end bonuses this time is not based on precedent, and I have also told the labor side not to insist. The city government also deeply understands and sympathizes with the hotel's situation of paying taxes on behalf of the guests. However, suffering is one issue, and taxes are another issue. We will do our best to accept opinions and improve on the issue of suffering. As for the central government's regulations, it will be extremely troublesome for our city to make changes again in the future, so it is better to collect taxes according to the central government's regulations. Subsequently, councilors expressed their opinions. Tao Baichuan advocated supporting the central government's laws and regulations. If the central government revises the 5% to 10%, it should also be supported because, for the sake of protecting the interests of the city's citizens, the taxes that should be levied on foreign travelers can be levied, otherwise it will increase the burden on the city's citizens. Luo Qinghua advocated that there must be a numerical regulation, limited to 5%. He cannot agree with protecting the interests of the city's citizens at the expense of increasing the burden on foreign guests. To prosper Shanghai, foreign guests must be welcomed, and moreover, there are also many citizens of this city living in hotels. Shao Yongsheng also said that many civil servants live in hotels, and they are also citizens of this city. Why must their burden be increased? As a result, this case was passed by a majority of the general assembly, amended according to Shao Yongsheng's opinion, and resolved that "taxes should be collected at 5%".

### Land and Business Taxes Decided to Be Assigned to Local Governments

The general assembly also passed three other cases yesterday: (1) Telegraphing the central government to allocate property rental income tax and stamp tax. (2) Telegraphing the central government to assign all land and business tax revenues to local governments. (3) In order to continue raising 500 million yuan for the 32nd-year Allied Victory Public Bonds as ordered, in addition to increasing and supplementing the allocation, the city government plans to separately solicit the remaining 100 million yuan and assign it to the district offices to be responsible for soliciting contributions in order to complete the task quickly.

### Budget Cannot Be Cleared - Adjournment Without End

[Report from This Newspaper] The agenda of the second session of the second Municipal Council was originally scheduled to hold a memorial week this morning, discuss the city's 36th-year budget, and then adjourn. It is now because there are too many cases to be discussed and cannot be completed as scheduled, so the discussion on tax and financial proposals will continue this morning. At the same time, the issue of whether to postpone the general assembly will also be put to a public vote at the general assembly today.

### Qian Jianqiu Hosts Women's Circle - Reports on the Experience of Attending the National Congress - Successful Efforts to Fight for Rights

Ms. Qian Jianqiu, Director of the Municipal Women's Association and Chairperson of the Women's Movement Committee, held a tea party at the Police Club on Aima Road yesterday at 3:00 PM to host the heads of various women's organizations in the city, report on the situation of attending the National Congress, and the efforts of all the women representatives to fight for the constitutional provisions. Representatives from the Shanghai Deyu Women's Advancement Association, the Chinese Women's Alliance, Women's Vocational Education, Law, Medicine, Labor, Sports, Middle School Students, University Students, and Family institutions, the Chinese Women's Society, the Chinese Women's Reform Association, and the Female Youth Group of the Three People's Principles Youth League attended. In addition, representatives from various women's circles in the city, such as Zhang Xiangwen, Fang Yingda, Zhu Suman, Wu Ruohua, Chen Zhenquan, Shen Muzhen, Yu Shuming, Xie Jinyuan's wife, Wang Jiazhen, Wang Peizhen, Jia Guanqing, Yan Weiru, Qiu Xisheng, Su Zufie, and Ling Qi, also attended, gathering together for a total of more than 50 people. Qian gave a speech saying: The constitution formulated by this National Congress will become the most progressive constitution in the world regarding the protection of women's right to participate in politics. Although the constitutions of Britain, the United States, and various European countries have not made such concrete provisions for women's political rights, I firmly believe that the demands put forward by Chinese women at this conference are the common aspirations of women around the world because, so far, women in various countries have not achieved true equality in politics, so the success of Chinese women in obtaining this in the constitution is truly gratifying. The improvement of women's status is not only about fighting for the right to participate in politics, but the failure to develop the right to participate in politics is the main obstacle to women's advancement. At this National Congress, Madame Chiang's efforts to fight for women's rights are truly commendable. The women's proposal was passed by the conference, which stipulates that the quota for women in various elections in the future will be 20%, and the method of producing representatives to the National Congress also designates representatives to be elected by women's organizations. In addition, the quota for women in the Legislative Yuan will also be stipulated.

### Morning Review Meeting Discusses Central Work; Summaries of Bureau Plans Reviewed and Revised

[Our Reporter] The special committee of the Municipal Council for reviewing the municipal government's central work plan for the 36th year and the summary report on the administration from September to November last year held a meeting at the Municipal Council site in Fuming Village yesterday morning. Representatives from all bureaus attended. During the meeting, Tao Baichuan stated: "The budget is based on the central work. If the central work is uncertain, the budget cannot be certain. The work plan and the budget prepared by the municipal government this time are not closely coordinated and appear to be disconnected. It is regrettable that the council did not submit this central work plan to various groups for review in advance. Now that the group review meetings have come to an end, it is impossible to hold them again. Therefore, nineteen people have been designated to form this committee for review. Since many of them have specialized knowledge, it is feared that they will not be able to handle it, but since they have been ordered, they will do their best." It was unanimously agreed not to discuss the implementation methods and completion deadlines of the plan. The summary of the plan was reviewed and revised.

(1) Civil Affairs: Rectifying the Baojia system and household registration are the central tasks for the 36th year, as designated by the Executive Yuan. Promoting clean areas is also an important task.

(2) Police Affairs: 1. Improve the quality of the police and strengthen police training. 2. Strengthen fire-fighting equipment. (The section on increasing police officers by 6,000 is temporarily suspended. If necessary, a supplementary budget will be requested.)

(3) Social Affairs: 1. Suppress commodity prices. 2. Promote cooperative undertakings. 3. Strengthen relief institutions. 4. Strive for labor-management cooperation to increase production. (Among them, the third item, relief institutions, is under the management of the fourth department of the Social Affairs Bureau, so the Municipal Relief Institute in the budget will be abolished to save funds.)

(4) Education: 1. Increase the number of national schools and national education classes. (The number of national education classes in the budget will be appropriately reduced to be used for establishing more national schools.) 2. Increase the number of public schools, supplementary schools, and vocational schools. Regarding the original plan to raise educational funds and promote private schooling, the Education Bureau has automatically withdrawn and postponed it because it is not easy to raise funds under the current economic downturn.

(5) Finance: The financial work plan for the city in the 36th year, in addition to continuing the important tasks of the 35th year, such as simplifying audit procedures and eliminating embezzlement, should increase taxes by eight points, especially by collecting city-wide property taxes and saving unnecessary expenses as the central task.

(6) Public Works: 1. Develop suburban transportation. 2. Reduce flooding. 3. Restore Nanshi and Zhabei. 4. Relieve housing shortages. 5. Urban planning. (The public works bureau's budget for this year's project to connect the north and south banks of the Suzhou Creek, flood prevention project, and Pudong Avenue expansion project was originally 50.3 billion, but due to insufficient funds, 21.8 billion has been reduced, so only a portion can be done this year. The case will be discussed separately.)

(7) Public Utilities: 1. Increase power and strengthen public utilities. 2. Improve wharf warehouses. 3. Add street lights. 4. Solve the water shortage in western Shanghai (because the municipal government has already submitted a special project, it will be left to the general meeting for discussion). 5. Strengthen public transportation.

(8) Land Administration: 1. Organize maps and records. 2. Land registration. 3. Determine land prices. 4. Promote land value tax.

(9) Health: 1. Promote health care. 2. Improve environmental sanitation.

Due to lack of time, the review of the administrative situation report was not held yesterday. It was agreed that the conveners of the group, Wang Jian'e, Tao Baichuan, and Fu Rulin, together with Zhu Wende, Tong Xingbai, and Wu Zhengzhao, would be jointly responsible for compiling a written report on the review opinions and submitting it to the general meeting today.

### City Party Headquarters Hosts Banquet for All Councilors

Fang, the director of the Shanghai City Party Headquarters, hosted a banquet for all municipal councilors at the Jin Gu Hotel at 7 p.m. yesterday, with more than 160 people attending. During the banquet, Director Fang delivered a speech, stating: "Everyone has worked very hard these past few days to discuss the city's political measures in the future. The City Party Headquarters serves the people, and today we have prepared a modest meal to express our respect for the representatives of the people. At the same time, we hope that you will give more guidance to the Party Headquarters, which serves the people. Democratic politics is just beginning, and everything must demonstrate a democratic style. This time, you have highly expressed public opinion in the Municipal Council and also fully understood the government's democratic political style." Deputy Minister Xu then delivered a thank-you speech on behalf of the attendees. After the speech, the guests and hosts raised their glasses to each other's health, and the atmosphere was warm and harmonious. The banquet ended happily around 9 p.m.

### Dismissal of Art Teachers No Longer Reconsidered; Students Merged into Xinlu Normal School

[Our Reporter] The Education Committee of the Municipal Council held its first temporary meeting yesterday morning to continue reviewing proposals: (1) Proposal to request the municipal government to establish schools for children of employees of autonomous agencies. Review opinion: The admission of children of employees of autonomous agencies should follow the example of children of public educators, allowing free admission without the need to establish special schools. (2) Telegram to the central government to quickly allocate the remaining enemy-puppet properties in the city area after the auction by the Enemy and Puppet Property Administration Bureau to the city's education funds. Review opinion: 1. Revise the reason for the original proposal, adding the four characters "cultural construction" under the two characters "education." 2. The committee will telegraph the Chairman of the National Government to approve the allocation. 3. Request the municipal government to earnestly carry out the plan. (3) Request for reconsideration of the case of dismissing the Municipal Art and Health Normal School. Review opinion: It was found that three of the four proposers of the original proposal and thirty-six of the supporters have applied to withdraw the case because "Director Gu reported that the students of the school have been merged into Xinlu Normal School, which does not hinder the cultivation of art teachers." Also, according to Article 85 of the Preliminary of People's Rights, "a resolution that has already been implemented shall naturally not be reconsidered," it is proposed that reconsideration should not be requested.

### Rather Be an Unfilial Son Than a Faithless Man? Shanghai University Graduate Commits Suicide by Poison

[Our Reporter] The youth, Ge Wenjun, twenty-five years old, from Ningbo, lived at No. 9, Siming Village, Zhongzheng Middle Road. He graduated from Shanghai University in the 33rd year of the Republic and later worked at the Enemy and Puppet Property Administration Bureau. In June of last summer, he changed to the Maoheng Import and Export Company at No. 208, HSBC Building, the Bund, as an accountant. He usually left early and returned late, spending his leisure time reading newspapers or teasing his younger siblings. Unexpectedly, he suddenly did not return home one night (the 10th). The next morning, his father, Ge Hongzhong (who worked at No. 99 Youdou Company), received the news and called the company to inquire, learning that Wenjun had not yet arrived at the company to work. He then called home to inquire, and his family said that Wenjun had returned home to sleep around 10 a.m. His father was at work at the time and did not have time to return home to inquire about the reason for staying out. When he returned home at 10 p.m., he went to Wenjun's room (the attic) to check and saw that Wenjun's face was pale and he was in a dying state. He also saw four empty bottles of sleeping pills on the table, knowing that it was suicide. He immediately called the Red Cross Hospital on Haig Road and summoned an ambulance to the hospital for treatment, but due to excessive poisoning, it was too late to save him, and he died shortly afterward.

After the hospital reported to the Jing'an Temple Sub-bureau, Inspector Meng Ruisheng and police officer Zhang Shouxin were ordered to go to his home to investigate and seized three suicide notes: (1) to his parents, (2) a suicide confession, and (3) a letter to his friend Gong Jialong. The writing in the suicide notes was smooth. The main points were: "I have received your loving care and upbringing, and I have been thinking for many years about your hard work and exhaustion for me. I have not yet repaid your kindness, and I am unfilial to end my life so lightly. I have always been loved and cherished, and I will inevitably grieve constantly when suddenly encountering this change. It is difficult to immediately release the love of parents for their children, but the great number is predetermined, and life and death are destined. It can also be seen that one reaps what one sows. The dead are gone, and the living should cherish themselves. I hope you will be optimistic and not be too sad, so as not to damage your health."

### Tender and Touching Letter

His confession stated: "According to the lunar calendar, I am already twenty-five years old. The end of the year is approaching, and I will add another year, but I have decided to die before the age of twenty-five. This is when the chart of life reaches its peak, and it is time to go back."

Why commit suicide? Heartbreak? No! Unemployment? No! I have a decent job. Economic pressure? Also no! I have enough income to maintain my personal livelihood every month. Dying for fear of crime? No! I have never committed any crimes, and I have a clear conscience. What is the real reason? To put it bluntly, "I am tired of traveling in this world and want to go to another paradise."

There is another thing I want to ask you to do. On the night of my death next year, offer a plum blossom (not a bouquet) in my room. Discard the flower the next day. Once is enough, and you don't need to do it again the second year. Because this plum blossom has another symbol. If there is no soul after death, then I am asking you to worship another person on my behalf. This is the third anniversary that I cannot complete because I will not be able to visit her grave in the third year. If there really is a soul, we will eventually meet one day in heaven.

There is also a list of remaining belongings listed below and placed in the iron box in the drawer by the wall, opened with key number 100, including more than one million in cash, several US dollars, a Simm wristwatch, and a gold ring.

According to the police officer in charge of the case, after investigation, it was learned that Ge Wenjun's death was actually a suicide for love. He had a lover, and their feelings were very deep, but due to the disagreement of their parents, he committed suicide. Ge vowed not to marry another woman, and this sudden suicide was still for this reason. The so-called "plum blossom" in the suicide note refers to her.

### Maid Tragically Strangled to Death; Where Did the Strange Visitor Come From Last Night?

[Our Reporter] Recently, murder cases have occurred frequently in the city. Yesterday, another maid, Li Ma, 26 years old, from Gaoyou, was strangled to death with hemp rope at No. 14, Lane 68, Shunchang Road (i.e., Yuqing Fang). Yesterday morning, because the deceased had not gotten up, the owner, Jiang Yaocai (manager of Yunji Paper Company), ordered the rickshaw driver, A Er, to go to her sleeping place in the small room behind the parlor downstairs to check. He saw her lying on the bed, half-naked, with several hemp ropes tied around her neck. He felt her and found that she was already dead. He was shocked and immediately reported to the Taishan Police Sub-bureau. Inspector Zhang Jiashi was dispatched, along with police officers Hao Wende and Zhang Dazhen, to investigate. The body was transported to the Tongren Fuyuan Tang for an autopsy. It was learned that the deceased was introduced by the rickshaw driver, A Er, last month. Her husband's name is Li Youde, who is currently a manager in a public toilet in Hongkou. The couple's relationship was not good. The maid's work was usually quite diligent. The day before yesterday evening, a fellow villager, someone named Jia, came to talk to her and left shortly afterward. There was some argument in the conversation. Around 8 p.m., another person came and entered the room with the deceased and soon left. Whether the case is a jealous murder is still under investigation by the police.

### Petitions Come in a Steady Stream; Assembly Overwhelmed

[Our Reporter] Yesterday, citizen groups went to the Municipal Council to petition on four occasions: 1. Twenty-four households on Huashan Road, because the Public Works Bureau wanted to connect the English and French tramways to facilitate north-south traffic, and will demolish houses, specially formed a petition group to preserve houses, went to the assembly yesterday afternoon, fifty men, women, old and young, each holding a flag, and holding incense sticks, kneeling in front of the assembly hall. Five councilors including Zhu Wenqi and the directors of the Land Administration Bureau and the Public Works Bureau received them. The representatives requested three points: (1) Please allow a temporary delay in demolition, (2) Pay compensation fees generously, (3) The municipal government should consider whether to demolish less and narrow the sidewalks to supplement. After discussion between the councilors and the directors, a delay in demolition was approved, or the deadline could be extended to the end of February, but the representatives were still dissatisfied, and the authorities agreed to consider it further.

2. The entire student body of the Municipal Experimental Public School, about 400 people, went to the assembly to request: (1) Do not change the school name and nature of the school, (2) Popularize public education throughout the city, and expand the experimental public school to accommodate more out-of-school people. The two councilors Zhong Yuliang and Lu Yinchu received them and promised to forward the request to the assembly for resolution.

3. Representatives of more than 100,000 residents living in enemy-puppet houses in Shanghai requested: (1) When the authorities auction houses, they should only auction their property rights, and do not make residents homeless! (2) Hope to maintain the status quo and live in peace and work! (3) Request the authorities not to force eviction and aggravate Shanghai's housing shortage! (4) Hope that the handling authorities will not violate public opinion and cause social unrest! (5) The property is enemy-puppet, but the people are not enemy-puppet, do not deprive the freedom of residence! The two councilors Wang Xianqing and Yan Yunsheng received them and accepted the opinions on their behalf, promising to submit them to the assembly for discussion and public resolution.

4. Representatives of unemployed workers from the rear came to Shanghai to petition, making three requests: (1) Request all factories to give priority to hiring unemployed workers from the rear. (2) The state-run China Agricultural Machinery Factory, jointly run by the Executive Yuan and the Agricultural and Forestry Commission, refuses to hire workers from the rear. Please negotiate with the factory to give priority to hiring them as much as possible. (3) Request the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration to allocate winter necessities to unemployed workers. Received by Shui Xiangyun and submitted to the assembly for resolution.

### Former Chinese Employees of the Two Concessions Petitioned at the Consulate Yesterday

[Our Reporter] More than 1,500 Chinese personnel from the former Public Concession Era, such as the Municipal Council's Police Department and Fire Brigade, gathered on the lawn of the British Consulate on the Bund outside Suzhou Creek yesterday morning, requesting the return of savings, pensions, and funeral funds previously stored in the Municipal Council. Yesterday was Sunday, and the British Consul-General and Deputy Consul-General were initially not in the consulate. They arrived at the consulate at 10 a.m. after hearing the news and discussed with the representative, Yao Zongmo, the former chief inspector of the Municipal Council Police Department. The petitioners were scattered on the lawn of the consulate waiting for a reply and chanted slogans asking the British Consulate to quickly release the savings accumulated from their blood and sweat. According to the previous Municipal Council, in order to reward police and fire personnel, they organized savings, where employees saved five yuan per month. Those who worked for one year received double pay at the end of the year, and one month's salary also had to be saved. Those who worked for eleven years had seven months deducted each month, and the Municipal Council added a bonus of eight yuan, totaling fifteen yuan deposited in the bank. Those who voluntarily retired after working for fifteen years, in addition to the savings plus interest, would also receive an additional year's salary. The above bonuses were kept by the Municipal Council. The petitioners all kept various receipts. They believed that the persons in charge of the Municipal Council were mostly British, so they firmly demanded that the British Consul convert and pay each person's due savings in accordance with the multiple of prices. At 11:30 a.m., the British Consul-General came forward and replied in public that after consulting with Mayor Wu today, representatives could be sent to listen to the reply on the 15th, and stated that the former Public Concession was a combination of more than two countries, and the United Kingdom only occupied one of them. The petitioners were satisfied and left. It is heard that there are more than 3,000 Chinese personnel in the bureau, and many have served for more than 20 years. According to current prices, each person can get about 10 to 20 million yuan.

More than 400 former French Municipal Bureau employees also gathered at the Sino-French School in Baxianqiao at 10 a.m. yesterday, requesting the French Consulate on Jinling Road, the Bund, to issue various accumulated funds. They also dispersed after mediation.

### Opening Ceremony of the Administrative Class of the Central Training Corps; Chief Education Officer Huang Presides over the Ceremony

General Huang Jie, Chief Education Officer of the Central Training Corps, arrived in Shanghai from Beijing at 8 a.m. yesterday. After getting off the train, Huang immediately went to the Shanghai Branch of the Central Training Corps on Shuidao Road, Zhabei, with Director Xuan Tiewu to preside over the opening ceremony of the training class for administrative personnel of the corps. The ceremony began at 10 a.m., attended by Mayor Wu Guozhen, Chief Commissioner Fang Zhi, Director Yang Junmai, etc. Huang, Chief Education Officer, presided over the meeting and delivered a speech. Before the speech began, Huang read the training speech of Chairman Jiang, who also served as the head of the corps. Huang also said that the purpose of veteran officers participating in retraining is to transform consumption into production and destruction into construction. The War of Resistance has been won, and the focus of future work is on construction. In the past, officers at all levels have made their best efforts to defend the country. Participating in national construction in the future is far more important than serving on the battlefield. The corps leader and deputy corps leader attach great importance to this. It is hoped that the trainees will adhere to this spirit and work tirelessly to complete the mission of national construction. After Huang's speech, Chief Commissioner Fang, Mayor Wu, and Director Xuan spoke in succession. The ceremony ended at 12 noon. It is heard that more than 2,000 officers from various corps were selected to participate in the administrative class. Due to traffic congestion, as of yesterday, 920 people had reported. More should arrive one after another. The training period for the class is three months. Upon completion, they will be assigned and employed by the Ministry of Interior.

According to a letter from the Secretariat of President Sun Ke's Mansion: "Regarding the news published in Shanghai and Nanjing newspapers on January 10 that there is a house dispute in Shanghai involving President Sun, I have received the following statement: President Sun has no houses for rent in Shanghai other than the mansion where he lives. As for the handwritten letter to a lawyer mentioned in the report, it is absolutely untrue. Correspondingly, it is corrected to avoid misunderstanding. Secretariat of President Sun's Mansion, January 12."

Also, Dai Rongduo wrote a letter: "I have just read the news "Judge Disputes Over House Involving Socialite" published on the second page of today's newspaper, which involves me and is inconsistent with the facts. The house at No. 4 Rose Villa, Baiyun Zhong Road, has always been rented by my sister Dai Shaoru, and I am not the tenant. The house at No. 11 Haiyuan, Haig Road, is also owned by her, and I am not the owner. There should be a lease deed to prove it. I dare not falsely claim it. I believe in the authority of your newspaper's news and its wide circulation. I am sincerely afraid that rumors will spread and cause misunderstandings. Please publish my letter to correct the record. I am deeply grateful. Dai Rongduo, January 10."

### Year-End Customs Record

Christmas has passed, and the New Year is also gone. Although the Gregorian calendar has been adopted for thirty-five years, people still fondly remember the old lunar calendar. During the Gregorian New Year, apart from the holidays and celebrations in institutions and schools, and the relative liveliness in entertainment venues, there is really nothing worth recording. On the contrary, these past few days, everyone has been busy preparing for the Lunar New Year, which is much more vibrant and colorful.

This annual Lunar New Year is taken very seriously in terms of customs. Honoring the gods and ancestors requires a lot of preparation. Regarding the customs of celebrating the New Year in Shanghai, Zhang Chunhua wrote eight "Shanghai Seasonal Songs." Here are four of them to give a glimpse of the old Shanghai's year-end scene. Although "outdated," they still serve as conversation pieces.

Fruits are displayed in abundance on the streets,

A sixty-day business, it is said.

Vegetables from the mountains fear being disliked,

Tender bamboo shoots are always called embroidered shoes.

This is the first of the eight songs, describing the street scene. Generally, families always buy some things for the New Year, preparing for year-end sacrifices or entertaining relatives and friends during the New Year. Consequently, many temporary vendors come to catch the year-end trade. Among them, the southern goods business is the most lively, hence the nickname "sixty-day shop." In Shanghai customs, dried bamboo shoots are indispensable for the New Year. Large pieces are mountain bamboo shoots, soaked in water and thinly sliced, then cooked with meat, a necessary dish for New Year's Eve. The tenderest bamboo shoots, because their shape resembles the small feet of women in the past, are called "embroidered shoe soles," which is quite sensual. Even now, at the end of each year, there are often people in the alleys calling out to sell sliced dried bamboo shoots, which is also a kind of temporary business at the end of the year.

Carrying baskets of reeds into the city,

Village fruits and vegetables fill the roads.

Why are the straw shoulder poles all unloaded?

Calculating to buy arrowheads for the Kitchen God's sacrifice.

Besides the good business for southern goods stores at the end of the year, people from nearby villages also come to the city to catch the trade. They bring vegetables and fruits into the city to exchange for some southern goods to take back for the New Year. Ordinary families also prepare some sesame cakes at the end of the year, because they cannot be bought during the New Year. Especially many seasonal items, which must be bought. Like arrowheads are necessary for Kitchen God’s sacrifice.

Faint thunder echoes across the short fence,

Grinding fragrant rice, looking like snow.

Teaching weavers to compete in ingenuity,

Fruit fillings are innovated to compete in flour craft.

Powdered grains are seasonal foods at the end of the year, so Shanghai customs dictate grinding flour to make grains at the year's end. Powdered grains are of two kinds, dry and wet. The wet kind is soup grains, and the dry kind is called "gold ingots," which are steamed in bamboo steamers. The filling inside has many varieties, commonly meat or bean paste. But the daughters-in-law often show ingenuity and compete with each other, using various fruits and vegetables to make fillings, which is one aspect of recipe innovation.

Every family makes New Year cakes by pounding flour,

Seeming to emulate the height of Suzhou and Taiwan's cakes each year.

Entering shops, it's as if it's the eighth month of autumn,

Osmanthus fragrance subtly dyes the cold robes.

Powdered grains and New Year cakes are embellishments for the year's end and the year's beginning. Upper-class families in Shanghai all hire people to make cakes. Pounding flour and mixing it with maltose, hammering it to make it firm. All cakes are rectangular and come in red and white colors. Some even collect osmanthus flowers from the eighth month and decorate the cake surface, naming it "Osmanthus New Year Cake," which has an even better fragrance. Nowadays, tea and food stores all sell New Year cakes. "A building every five steps, a pavilion every ten steps." They are everywhere, so residents don't have to bother making them themselves. Families who make their own cakes are probably a very small minority now.

### Incense Smoke Lingering, Candlelight Flickering: At the Rainbow Temple, Devout Men and Women Burn Incense and Kowtow in Gratitude Before Fortunate Gods, While Those with Bad Luck Pray and Seek a Fortune

It's the end of the lunar year again. Throughout the year, many "lucky" people, as usual, go to "Buddha" to burn incense and kowtow in gratitude, and many "unlucky" people go to "Buddha" to "cry out" for mercy, begging the "greatly compassionate" Buddha to grant them good luck next year.

Therefore, during those two days, the Rainbow Temple on Nanjing Road suddenly becomes lively.

The red-lacquered gate and palace-style structure, squeezed next to the rows of foreign-style buildings and mansions on Nanjing Road, appear particularly out of place. Every time I pass by, I always feel a bit of humor. However, aren't all Chinese things laughable when you break them down?

The Rainbow Temple was originally named "Bao'an Situ Temple." Before the Songhu War, it was just like a broken temple in the countryside, "without any makeup." Later, devout men and women donated money to renovate the facade, making the exterior look more beautiful, but the inside remains the same as before.

Stepping into the temple gate, plaques such as "Every Prayer is Answered" and "Protecting One Area" on the walls above and on both sides are dazzling. To the left of the door is a clean stall selling "Guanyin Sutra," "Buddha's Amitabha Sutra," "Diamond Sutra," and so on. Further in, one can immediately see the fortune tellers in the "fortune-telling halls," stroking their beards and talking eloquently to customers sitting at the tables. Next to another door hangs a wooden sign that says "XXX Doctor of Internal Medicine, Gynecology, and General Pulse."

Inside the main hall, incense smoke lingers, and the inscriptions on the plaques above the hall have been blurred by smoke. However, the light here seems to be slightly better than that of the City God Temple in Nanshi. In the hazy smoke, many people are lighting incense and candles, kneeling, praying, and seeking fortunes. These people include old grandmothers with wrinkled skin and white hair, modern women with permed hair, simple and honest country folks, and coolies in blue cloth shirts and pants...

Stepping into the "Guan Yu Hall," one sees Zhou Cang with his black face, leading the Red Hare horse. Perhaps for the New Year, the Red Hare horse has also been given a new look, with a green vegetable in its mouth. Coming out and passing in front of the main hall, a woman in a black fox fur coat and a red scarf is devoutly kowtowing. Out of curiosity, the reporter randomly drew a fortune stick from the fortune box on the table. It was the twenty-fourth Guanyin fortune. After paying 200 yuan in legal currency, I exchanged it for a yellow paper at the counter on the left, which turned out to be a "very bad" fortune. It read:

"Neither a neighbor nor a family,

Forever indulging in foolishness like fallen flowers.

If you ask for the emperor's favor, it's hard to get help,

In the end, everything is as chaotic as hemp."

Wandering out of the "Zodiac Hall," the incense and candle shop next to the temple is rushing to renovate its facade. For decades, this shop has prospered thanks to the Rainbow Temple. Every year at the end of the lunar year, the temple is filled with visitors, and the shop is also extremely crowded, with a feeling of "guests being treated as if they were at home." "New Year" is coming, so it must be time to do good business!

Yuanbao Tea

In a society eager for wealth, during the Lunar New Year, in addition to hearing "Congratulations and may you prosper" and other auspicious greetings, "Yuanbao Tea" is also used to serve guests, taking its pronunciation for good luck. Yuanbao Tea is made by putting Chinese olives in tea. These green olives are bitter and astringent at first taste, but have a clear, fragrant, and sweet aftertaste, so they are quite popular. But who knows who "called a deer a horse" and named them "yuanbao" to cater to the public's desire for wealth? After the olives gained the elegant name of "yuanbao," their value immediately increased tenfold, soaring during the Lunar New Year, and this year will certainly not be an exception. Fortunately, "yuanbao" are welcomed by everyone, and although the price of olives has increased, they are still valued everywhere.

### Qi Zhen

"Although ancestors are distant, sacrifices must be sincere." Our country, a patriarchal society, considers ancestors unforgettable. At the year's end, the living can enjoy themselves in a timely manner, and the deceased must also be honored. Therefore, portraits of ancestors are brought out, with fruit platters, pastries, wine, and dishes displayed, incense is burned, and candles are lit. This is what is called "Qi Zhen."

Portraits of ancestors are usually not charcoal sketches or photographs, but scrolls. Men wear court attire with official hats, and women wear phoenix coronets and robes. There are also collective images of three, four, or five generations in Ming Dynasty attire, exuding ancient charm. In wealthy families, the walls are lined with portraits, making the photography studios in the city temples pale in comparison.

Portraits are usually hung from December 25th and taken down after the Lantern Festival, but some are only hung for the first five days of the New Year. In addition to family members kowtowing, relatives and friends who visit during the Lunar New Year must also kowtow before the portraits as a New Year's greeting.

### The Story of Lucky Money: Nan Gai, at Five Years Old, Pays Homage to the Emperor

Children are happiest during holidays, and the New Year makes them even happier. In addition to good food and new clothes, they also receive a red envelope after bowing and kowtowing, which is called "lucky money." For children who usually only spend and have no income, lucky money is their largest sum of wealth.

There is a story in "Marvels Old and New" about "Nan Gai, at Five Years Old, Paying Homage to the Emperor," which is said to be the origin of lucky money. Wang Shao's five-year-old son, Nan Gai, was watching lanterns with his family during the Lantern Festival when he was carried away by a villain. It happened that the emperor was at the upper pavilion, and Nan Gai cried out to him. The thief was captured. The emperor was pleased with his courage and gave him money and fruit to soothe his fright. Thus, the custom of "giving lucky money every year" has been passed down to this day. Since then, every year near the end of the year, adults give money to the younger generation as a matter of course.

Ancient lucky money was very meaningful, with copper coins strung together with red and green silk threads, tied into various shapes. Those with pointed ends shaped like olives were called "yuanbao money," and those in the shape of an "X" were called "victory money," which were more common. There were also those who were more creative, doing everything possible to compete in ingenuity, all to gain good luck. The distribution of such lucky money was determined by the accountants of large families. Copper coins that were tied very tightly, plus a string of prayer beads, were beautifully named "ruyi money," wrapped in gold-stamped red paper and placed in a brocade box. It was truly a special skill of the time. Many embroidery shops specialized in wrapping them for people, which was also a side business for women, but unfortunately, it is now difficult to find one or two people who can tie lucky money.

When silver dollars were popular in the past, lucky money was usually one yuan. As prices rose, lucky money also increased. "Lucky money every year, increasing wealth every year." In this recessionary year, the lucky money spent cannot be considered a small amount. Since the abolition of silver dollars, colorful banknotes do not seem as substantial as silver coins, so some people have come up with a lucky money bag. The banknotes are stuffed into a plum-red envelope, which is indeed beautifully decorated. These inexpensive and beautiful lucky money bags are a good year-end business for paper shops.

Some children whose fathers have more extensive social circles have considerable income from lucky money each year. If this money could be saved up as education expenses for the children in the future, wouldn't it be very meaningful? Unfortunately, most of it is used to buy food, toys, or even used as gambling money, which is a problem worthy of discussion in education.

### The Origin of the Kitchen God

The custom of sacrificing to the Kitchen God has a very ancient origin. The bronze tripod says, "Sacrifices are exhausted at the stove." The Huainanzi says, "The Yellow Emperor created the stove and became the Kitchen God after death." The Xijing Miscellany says, "The Kitchen God looks like a beautiful woman." The legends are truly diverse and inconclusive. Another interesting saying is that the Kitchen God's common name was Wu Ji. He was poor and lived by selling firewood, and he was very filial to his mother. One day, he met a physiognomist who told him that a great disaster was about to befall him and that he should avoid it quickly. When asked how to avoid it, the physiognomist said, "You will have a hundred days of imprisonment. Go home and draw a prison on the ground with lime. You can avoid it by going out again after a hundred days." After saying this, the physiognomist suddenly disappeared. Wu Ji knew there was something unusual. He hesitated to pick up the firewood. Suddenly, one end of the firewood fell off, and the carrying pole struck a passerby on the head, killing him instantly. Wu Ji was arrested and sent to the magistrate. After inquiring, the magistrate learned that Wu Ji had an eighty-year-old mother and should be allowed to return home to visit her. The magistrate praised his filial piety and temporarily released him. After returning home, Wu Ji drew a prison on the ground and sat there for ninety-nine days. He went to the magistrate again. The magistrate asked why the family of the deceased had not come. Wu Ji replied that he was in mourning. The magistrate investigated and found it to be true, so he did not pursue the matter further. Wu Ji died of illness and was conferred the title of Kitchen God, the head of the family, monitoring the words and deeds of the family members, recording their good and bad deeds for reward and punishment. So it goes. Consult and borrow.

### Ten-Ingredient Vegetable Dish: A Must-Have for Every Family

The ten-ingredient vegetable dish is a must-have dish for Shanghai people during the Lunar New Year. It is made with wood ear fungus, daylily buds, bean sprouts, lotus root, carrots, pickled cucumber, pickled cabbage, bamboo shoots, tofu skin, and so on, stir-fried together. Whether it is a large or small household, a lot must be stir-fried. Especially for families with many people, almost a whole jar must be stir-fried, prepared for eating during the New Year. It is said that those vegetables all have very good auspicious meanings.

In addition, soybean sprouts are called "ruyi vegetables," arrowhead with arrowhead (water chestnuts) and pickled vegetables are called "peace and happiness vegetables," and shepherd's purse is called "escape from suffering vegetables." All are seasonal dishes during the New Year, hence bestowed with auspicious names.

### Year-End Flower Market: Chinese Winter Sweet and Heavenly Bamboo Compete in Beauty

The bright red poinsettias, adorned with Christmas, contrast beautifully with the green Christmas trees and white snowflakes. As Christmas and the New Year pass, the poinsettias wither away. Replacing them are the solitary Chinese winter sweet, the heavenly bamboo with its red berries, the yellow and crispy wintersweet, and the elegant narcissus, all of which are desk decorations at the end of the lunar year. They seem more elegant than the poinsettias.

Shanghai, a city with ten feet of dust, is disconnected from gardening. The cramped houses are already enough to bear, let alone having space to cultivate flowers and plant bamboo, doing the cheerful task of nurturing the spirit. Ordinary upper-middle-class families, to make their houses more beautiful, go to the market to buy flowers. On weekdays, the flower market is filled with foreign flowers such as roses, violets, foreign chrysanthemums, lilies, dahlias, etc., which are supplied to foreigners and modern ladies. In addition, flower baskets for celebrations and wreaths for funerals are also a major business.

But when the New Year is approaching, domestic flowers, which usually do not attract much attention, compete in beauty in the market. In addition to the seasonal plum blossoms, heavenly bamboo, and narcissus, there are also very exquisite bonsai, with vigorous branches and leaves emerging from the old tree stumps, full of poetic and artistic feeling.

Plum Blossoms and Camellias: "Exploring Plum Blossoms" is an elegant pursuit for scholars. Dengwei and Gushan do not know how many tourists they have attracted. People who cannot escape this noisy city also want to get a few potted plum trees to decorate their studies and living rooms, to show elegance. Therefore, there are quite a few plum trees on display in the flower market. Each old and eroded branch, like bronze, rock, dragon coiling, and tiger crouching, is tied with a blooming flower. Some are so-called split plum blossoms, like being inserted on a piece of wood, which is extremely strange. There are also those who add pine and bamboo next to the plum blossoms, becoming a picture of the Three Friends of Winter, which is especially welcomed.

Heavenly Bamboo: The heavenly bamboo, with strings of blood-red berries revealed in the emerald green leaves, symbolizes the glory of the new spring and brings the light of the future. Of course, you must choose those with many berries, because the beauty of the whole heavenly bamboo lies in these few red berries, but having berries without leaves is too monotonous. The green leaves are essential. The sellers tie together those with berries but no leaves and those with leaves but no berries, making it a perfect heavenly bamboo, and the price also increases a lot. This is what flower buyers should pay attention to.

Wintersweet: Wintersweet and heavenly bamboo are truly a match made in heaven. When the berries of the heavenly bamboo turn red, it is also the time when the wintersweet blooms. Green leaves, red berries, and yellow flowers make for the most moving picture. Wintersweet with a plain heart and wide mouth is considered the best, because ordinary wintersweet mostly has a red heart, so a plain heart is more precious, and the fragrance is also very rich. In the market, there are still many wintersweet with plain hearts, but those with wide mouths are rare, which is truly a pity.

Narcissus: The narcissus, known as the "fairy on the water," also comes to join the fun at this time. A burst of fragrance seems to be enticing passersby. Narcissus is divided into single-petal and double-petal. It is generally believed that double-petal is better, but the single-petal is the real old-fashioned narcissus. In terms of form, there is also a difference between straight plants and crab claws. Crab claws are made artificially, so they are more precious. In many flower shops, there are also foreign narcissus on display. Although they have colorful flowers, they are not as elegant as domestic narcissus.

Flower Market: Before the war, the headquarters of the year-end flower market was in the City God Temple. After the war, it moved to the area of Second Ma Road and Wangping Street. Under the Cishu Building, it became an annual flower market. On the walls of the foreign cemetery, it simply became a large screen composed of cold plum blossoms, heavenly bamboo, and wintersweet. People who cannot go to Dengwei and Gushan might as well treat this place as a "plum-viewing resort." This year, the City God Temple is already very lively, but the prosperity near the Cishu Building should not be too deserted.

Flower Vendors: The flowers here mostly come from villages more than ten miles away. Some are villagers who use this time to earn some money for the New Year by selling the crystallization of their cultivation, while others are flower vendors who transport the flowers from the countryside to the city to supply the needs of the Spring Festival. Some are young people, some are old women, and some are young girls, relying on their clever tongues to deal with their customers.

High Prices: In several large companies, the flower trade is usually very quiet, but it has also become lively these days. The prices of fresh flowers displayed in the company are very different from those on the flower stalls, especially the potted plants cultivated by experts. In the eyes of people with artistic cultivation, they are elegant and refined, but ordinary people cannot help but stick out their tongues when they see the prices.

With high prices, the seasonal wintersweet, heavenly bamboo, and cold plum blossoms are priced in the tens of thousands. Because in this recessionary year, all industries are very depressed, not to mention flowers, which are regarded as luxury goods. It seems that although there are crowded people and many who appreciate and browse, there are few who really buy flowers!

### Dried Bamboo Shoots, Vermicelli, White Sugar, Red Dates: People on the Road Hustle and Bustle, Busy Preparing for the New Year

These days, there are more people coming and going on the roads, and the shops are also crowded, fully showing the scene of celebrating the New Year. For the New Year, New Year's Eve dinner, and spring wine, many things are needed. Housewives usually have to work hard for these many things, which is called preparing for the New Year. All stores "profit threefold," among which southern goods stores, incense and candle stores, liquor stores, soy sauce stores, barbershops, pastry shops, etc., have even more prosperous business. There are also many temporary stalls that catch the good business of the year-end.

Southern goods stores are the most lively during the New Year. Some set up arches at the entrance of the store and hang a pair of earth lamps, shining brightly at night. Layer upon layer of customers surround the counter, making it impenetrable. Although the store clerks temporarily add manpower, they are still busy in circles. Dried bamboo shoots, vermicelli, white sugar, red dates, lotus seeds... etc., one by one they "select," "weigh," and "pack" for the customers. When several large customers come to the door, the clerks are particularly attentive, serving tea and melon seeds, and then packing all the things the guests want to buy one by one. If they are old customers, they can also enjoy a 10% discount. If they are ladies from the countryside, they will receive a complimentary packet of peanuts or melon seeds.

Incense, Candles, and Paper Ingots: Still Hard to Stop

Incense and candle shops are a kind of superstitious business. On weekdays, every lunar new moon, or the birthday of gods and Buddhas, the business is already considerable. During the Lunar New Year, business is even busier. Most of the facades are decorated to be brand new, with lotus oil lamps lit for decoration. Candles are also a major transaction at the end of the year. Although electric lights are bright now, every household must buy a few pairs of candles, just to be seasonal. Other items such as divine horses, yuanbao, and paper ingots are sold in large quantities. Firecrackers are also seasonal goods in incense and candle shops. In addition to being used for worshiping gods, children also use them as toys.

Oil, Salt, Sauce, Vinegar: Buy a Whole Jar

The so-called seven things to start the day, among them oil, salt, sauce, and vinegar, must be bought from the soy sauce garden. On weekdays, liquor and sauce shops are inseparable from citizens. At the end of the year, the demand increases even more, especially the wine for worshiping gods and the oil for cooking, which are almost several times more than usual. At least enough for ten days or half a month during the New Year must be prepared, so most people who walk into liquor and soy sauce shops come out with bottles full. Wealthy families buy whole jars of wine and original boxes of oil to prepare for the New Year.

Pickled Meat Shops: Suddenly Lively

Pickled meat shops, which are originally very quiet, suddenly become lively these days. When there is no fresh meat to sell at the beginning of the year, pickled meat can be stored for a long time. If guests come occasionally during the New Year, it can be conveniently taken out as a dish. This is a decoration for the New Year, beautifully named "hometown meat." At this time, in addition to the original pickled meat shops, there are also many temporary shops with only a tabletop and a hard board. As soon as you open the door, you see red paper strips with large price reductions. Some even hired a band to play music in the shop, making it particularly lively.

Barbershops are even more "full of guests." Although there is a sign on the wall that says "Agreed by the Industry Association, All Prices Doubled," using peach-red paper, it is particularly eye-catching, but the customers who come to the door are still in an endless stream, because no one wants to have long and messy hair in the New Year.

Seasonal Foods: New Year Cake is the Top Choice

New Year cake is a well-deserved seasonal food, as valued as the zongzi of the Dragon Boat Festival and the mooncakes of the Mid-Autumn Festival. Many pastry shops put aside their usual work and specialize in making New Year cakes to meet the market. On the counters of tea and food shops, New Year cakes are also stacked high, and in many new-style food shops, New Year cakes are decorated with many characters and patterns, placed in glass brocade boxes, raising their status. Next to the vegetable market, in the gaps in the shops, there are temporary New Year cake workshops, most of which specialize in making Ningbo New Year cakes.

In addition to the shops mentioned above, other shops such as shoes and hats, fruits, candies, cigarettes, tin foil, and clothing all have more business than usual. In the vegetable market, chicken, duck, fish, and meat are also more abundant than usual. However, this is only a temporary phenomenon. Once the Lantern Festival passes, business will return to normal.

### Housewives Personally Take Charge, All Returning Fully Loaded

Most of those who prepare for the New Year are housewives who personally take charge. Walking into the store, they are greeted with smiling faces. After selecting, they return with baskets full and bags large and small, either by private car or by calling a tricycle, all returning fully loaded. But there are also wives of poor families, because their husbands' income is not much, and the funds used to prepare for the New Year are even more limited. Buying this, lacking that, they are also very hesitant. As the saying goes, "Poor couples have a hundred sorrows," which is even more evident at the Lunar New Year. However, to put it another way, every virtuous wife, under today's difficult situation, should understand the difficulty of making a living and not take the customs of celebrating the New Year too seriously. The luxury of the neighbors is not worth envying. Being able to reconcile with her husband and children, and sit together, is the joy of the world. Raising a glass to drink, everyone should bless the New Year.

### Finance Deputy Xu Baiwei Claims This Year Can Be Considered an Economic Construction Year; Production Loans Must Be Used Appropriately; While Productive Enterprises Rely on Capital Assistance, They Must Have Cooperation from All Sides to Succeed

[Our Newspaper News] Xu Baiyuan, Deputy Minister of Finance and Secretary-General of the Four Joint Treasury, stated that since the establishment of the Provisional Review Committee for Production Enterprise Loans on December 10th of last year, one month has passed. To ensure that all sectors understand the recent situation of the committee, he specially invited the city's news media to the conference room of the Four Joint Branch on the first floor of the Bank of China Building at 4:00 PM yesterday. Mr. Xu delivered a speech as follows:

This production enterprise loan is handled in accordance with Premier Song's repeated instructions and the principle of actively assisting the development of production enterprises. It has been progressing smoothly for a month. All members of the committee are socially respected leaders and are undoubtedly very busy with official duties. However, they are able to attend the meetings three times a week in person and discuss matters seriously. This spirit of putting public interests before personal ones is truly admirable. In my opinion, the production loan method is a major test of financial and economic cooperation in construction in the future. The following three points deserve special attention:

(1) To mobilize the manpower and financial resources of all financial institutions to assist the development of industrial and commercial enterprises: In the past, financial business responsibilities related to the implementation of national policies have also enjoyed the right to rediscount with the Central Bank. All commercial banks and firms can, in accordance with the principles, not only utilize the strength of all financial institutions to assist the development of production enterprises, but also urge commercial banks and firms to work hard to promote normal business and guide capital into the path of active construction. In particular, it can strengthen the ties between national financial institutions and commercial banks and firms, take uniform steps, and jointly bear the heavy responsibility of economic construction in the future. As for the responsibility issue of commercial banks and firms, the government has made extremely reasonable decisions and will not allow them to be burdened as a result.

(2) In order to fully realize the effectiveness of the loaned funds and ensure that they are fully used for legitimate production purposes, negative aspects must avoid improper use. On the positive side, the role of increasing production must be brought into play. Because the current economic and financial situation has not yet reached a completely stable state, we sincerely hope for the development of production enterprises and will try every means to provide loan assistance. However, if loans are obtained under the guise of production but are used for speculation and hoarding, it will actually harm the interests of the entire society and damage the reputation of production enterprises. Therefore, the pre-review by this committee must be cautious and thorough, and the post-assessment should be as strict as possible. In the future, for factories that work hard to increase production, can properly use loans, increase output, and improve quality, we will continue to provide greater assistance to encourage the development of their business. As for internal handling procedures, we strive for simplicity. General application cases can be completed within one week. Staff members take little rest even during holidays so that there will be no delays due to thoroughness and caution.

(3) To seek close cooperation among financial business, government, and various sectors of society, and to jointly seek progress. It is important to know that the development of production enterprises, in addition to capital assistance, also relies on cooperation from all aspects of administration and society to succeed. For example, technological improvement, labor-management coordination, raw material supply, smooth transportation, tax system adjustment, and the supervision and encouragement of public opinion are all closely related. Since the establishment of this committee, we have been deeply grateful for the assistance from relevant government departments and all sectors of society, as well as the encouragement from the media. The staff is excited and deeply believes that continuing to develop this spirit of mutual cooperation and mutual assistance will lay a solid foundation for the future of China's production enterprises, that is, the future of economic construction, and will greatly benefit the national economy and the people's livelihood.

In short, future construction issues should prioritize production. Everything that is conducive to the development of production should be done to the best of our ability. Shanghai has always been the leader of the country's economy, and it is hoped that it will set an example and serve as a demonstration for the whole country. Regarding the handling of production enterprise loans in other important areas, Premier Song has also approved general rules and designated Tianjin, Beiping, Qingdao, Wuhan, Nanchang, Changsha, Chongqing, Chengdu, Kunming, Guangzhou, and other places to be held together. It is hoped that the media will provide more guidance.

### General Rules for Production Enterprise Loans in Various Regions

The full text of the eleven articles of the "General Rules for Production Enterprise Loans in Various Regions" was passed by the 334th Board of Directors of the Four Joint Treasury on January 9th of this year. The full text is as follows:

(1) In areas designated by the Four Joint Treasury, national banks and other financial institutions should handle production enterprise loans in accordance with these general rules. (2) The loan targets are limited to the following industries: 1. Essential goods manufacturing industries. 2. Mining. 3. Export trade goods manufacturing industries. 4. Local specialty industries. 5. Other approved industries. (3) The nature of the loan is limited to assisting the necessary working capital of various industries. The expenses for adding machinery and equipment should be raised by the industries themselves. (4) In addition to raw materials and finished products, machinery and equipment, together with factory buildings and bases, can be added as collateral, but shall not exceed 50%. (5) The loan interest rate should be proposed by the local Four Joint Branch, taking into account the local situation, and reported to the Four Joint Treasury for approval. (6) The loan period is tentatively set at six months. (7) Other loan conditions should be handled with reference to the various measures for production enterprise loans in the Shanghai area. (8) Applications for loans from various industries should be individually submitted to the local Four Joint Branch or applied for by the banks on behalf of the Four Joint Branch. (9) Loans approved by the Four Joint Branch, whose amount is less than 50 million yuan, may be loaned by the local bank first and reported for record.

### Deputy Director Xu's Explanation

Mr. Xu then briefly explained the loan guidelines. He said that the original provision had a total of seven articles, later expanded to twelve articles by the Premier Song's instructions. The main loan target is the manufacturing industry. The provision in Article 2, Paragraph 5, is intended to indicate that the loan target has flexibility so that other approved businesses can also apply for loans. However, businesses such as transportation and public utilities, because of the massive scale, are not included. As for the handling of loan cases, in Shanghai, the situation is complex and there are many cases, so a production loan association is specially established under the structure of the Four Joint Branches. In other regions, in addition to the local Four Joint Branches being in charge, they can also liaise with the local Ministry of Economic Affairs' Industrial and Commercial Guidance Office and the Chamber of Commerce to obtain technical assistance. Provincial and municipal local banks have the mission of assisting local production enterprises in accordance with the rules for managing banks by the Ministry of Finance, so they should be able to participate in undertaking local production and entertainment loans. As for bad debt events that may occur in commercial banks’ loans, Xu believes that there is no need to worry too much. The government's position will never embarrass commercial banks as a result. In the end, we hope to seek a reasonable solution based on the actual situation.

Finally, Mr. Xu answered questions from reporters. The main points are as follows: (1) The reason why loans are limited to the necessary working capital of various industries is to encourage factories that have already achieved results to increase production. And these factories must at least have considerable fixed production equipment so that they can fully produce after obtaining a loan. (2) Some people think that the provision of 50 million yuan in Article 9 of the local loan guidelines is too small. This point will be reviewed and relaxed. He deeply hopes that the human and financial resources of local provinces and cities and commercial banks can be used for production purposes so that financial business can tend to assist production enterprises in the future. (4) Regarding the review of loan cases, we will uphold the principles of openness and strictness to show fairness. At the same time, we hope that the production loan in this city will be successful and become a model for other places. (5) Regarding the organization of the production loan association in this city, it is temporary in nature and hopes to end it in one or two months. However, the business of production loans will continue unabated. This year can be called the year of economic construction, so we urgently hope that production loans can cooperate with other economic conditions to promote domestic production enterprises and complete the great plan of national construction.

### Hankou Exporters Request Increased Exchange Settlement Subsidies

Hankou exporters have recently stated that due to price fluctuations, export trade is difficult to develop. They have specially submitted proposals to the finance and economic departments, suggesting the following points: (1) Reform the subsidy system with a certain limit. For example, if exports can settle millions of US dollars, the government will provide certain subsidies according to the official price. When the subsidies increase, the amount should be subsidized using progressive methods. In this way, even if there is a difference in foreign prices, the subsidies obtained can be used as compensation. (2) Restore the wartime trade committee’s regulations on import and export linkage methods. When the government strictly controls imports and exports, if importers cannot easily obtain foreign exchange, they may request permission from exporters to use the foreign exchange obtained from exporting materials to purchase this imported goods, so that the profits obtained can compensate for export losses.

### Increased Cotton Production in Various Countries; Trade Competition Will Be Fierce

[Reuters, London, 10th] The major changes in the international textile situation recently should be attributed to the end of the Washington Joint Textile Committee on December 31 and the cancellation of the export reservation system. In recent years, the Joint Textile Committee has "allocated" cotton goods from the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, India, and Brazil to various markets in urgent need (but the method is still determined by each government when implemented). The export reservation system has recently forced American cotton yarn manufacturers to specially reserve a certain amount of production for export. In the first quarter of 1947, the large export volume of the United States was only a limit. It is difficult to guarantee whether overseas countries can obtain it. It probably depends on whether these countries can compete at high prices in the US domestic market with money or friendship. However, no country can compete with the United States in terms of money. Therefore, the United States will export to maintain its friendship in overseas markets, but whether it can reach 230 million yards remains to be seen. In 1946, Brazil and India stopped exporting for a long time due to frequent domestic shortages. It is generally believed that the US export volume has far exceeded the total limit. Brazil and India have resumed exporting, and European countries exporting cotton goods are more than a year ago. Japan is also recovering from a paralyzed state, so the quantity of international cotton trade and the scope of international competition are gradually increasing.

### The Banking and Money Shop Joint Reserve Will Handle Public Treasury Certificate Lending to Regulate the Year-End Funds of Various Banks and Shops

The Shanghai Banking and Money Shop Joint Reserve is jointly organized by the city's banking and money shop industry. All member banks and money shops pay reserve assets, such as real estate, to enrich the reserves of various banks and shops. After evaluation and registration with the Land Administration Bureau, public treasury certificates are issued for these deposited reserve assets, which can be used for lending from the association. Now that the Lunar New Year is approaching, in order to regulate the funds of the banking and money shop industry, the association is adding purple handling of public treasury certificate lending. The lending interest rate is calculated based on the market rate.

### Tightening Credit Loans in the City's Banking and Money Shop Industry

As the Lunar New Year approaches in an instant, in order to prevent the bad trend of bankruptcy, the banking and money shop industry in this city is planning to tighten credit loans to reduce risks. It is learned that the Sichuan help banks and shops in Shanghai have also begun to tighten measures on the loan side recently.

### MacArthur's Headquarters is Prepared to Remove and Dismantle Japanese Factories for Compensation

[United Press, Tokyo, 10th] MacArthur's headquarters announced today that it has not yet received instructions regarding the removal and dismantling of Japanese factory machinery as compensation. Once instructions are received, it will be handled immediately. MacArthur's headquarters has now designated about 1,000 Japanese factories to be dismantled and transported, but transportation procedures are a major problem. It is not known which country will provide ships to transport this industrial equipment to countries requesting compensation. China and the Philippines have no ships, and US ships may have to be used for transportation in the future. As for how to distribute the machinery from more than 1,000 Japanese factories that have already been designated, a list has been opened, but no final decision has been made. According to Washington, the State Department and the Army Department announced on the 9th that the United States has decided to immediately collect Japanese compensation, regardless of whether the Soviet Union and other wartime allies agree. According to Zhang Feier, acting director of the Far East Department of the State Department, an urgent instruction will be issued to MacArthur immediately to start removing and dismantling Japanese factories and their equipment for compensation. Army Deputy Minister Peterson also said that MacArthur and the Japanese government will be notified as soon as possible of which industries should be retained in Japan so that the Japanese can use it to seek economic recovery on a realistic basis and no longer rely on US aid. Although this action should be notified to the Far East Committee, it does not have to wait for its formal approval. In terms of the Japanese occupying forces, the United States has 124,000 troops and the United Kingdom has 40,000 troops. Peterson also said that the United States has transported more than 2 million tons of grain to Japan, which should be paid by Japan.

### Prominent Economist Keynes Comments on the Chinese Economy: Unbalanced Budget is the Main Cause of Deterioration

[United Press, Hong Kong, 11th] Prominent economist Keynes wrote in the "Far Eastern Economic Review" that the biggest factor in China's current economic chaos is the unbalanced budget.

Keynes listed China's assets as follows:

(1) Enemy property in China, the amount is "amazing" and cannot be reliably calculated.

(2) Direct military compensation paid by Japan for funds and other items, China can divide about 2 billion US dollars for factories alone.

(3) Increased tax revenue. The government's current tax collection is "higher than before the war to an incomparable extent."

(4) UN relief to China, only cash, will reach 1 billion US dollars, not counting materials, medicines or industrial chemicals.

(5) The US military in China spends a lot of money.

(6) Recovering the Northeast and Taiwan, the assets in the two places are "huge."

(7) Foreign investment in China. The US government and private enterprises are willing to make long-term investments in China, but "if the civil war continues to exist, no one expects to sink funds into China."

(8) Remittances from overseas Chinese back to China. It is estimated that in 1946, the number will not be less than 100 million US dollars.

Keynes estimates the unfavorable factors as follows:

(1) Wages are "too high."

(2) The government does not have a clear policy, resulting in a lot of national wealth losses.

(3) Inconvenient transportation, which is now worse due to damage and CCP destruction.

(4) High interest rates and high tax rates destroy local industries.

(5) Smuggling loses tariffs and cannot control the entry of certain types of goods.

(6) Insufficient exports. Exports are the "main factor in rebuilding economic balance." In the first six months of 1946, Shanghai's exports were only 13% of imports, which was 89% in 1937.

(7) The civil war consumes 75% of China's budget, "unless this major burden is removed, the economy will continue to deteriorate."

Keynes ended by saying, "Frankly speaking, the Chinese economy has deteriorated to the point where it is quite difficult to immediately put it back on track."

### Dye and Pigment Names are Confused and Undifferentiated; the Chamber of Commerce Advises Correction

Pigments and dyes were originally two different things. In this city, the names of dye shops and the names of associations are mistakenly called pigments, resulting in confusion with pigment shops. After the city's Chamber of Commerce received a request from the National Pigment and Sundry Goods Industry Association, it convened representatives of the two industries for talks at 2:00 PM yesterday. The representatives of the National Pigment and Sundry Goods Association (pigment industry) Wang Boheng, Fu Zhigao, and the representatives of the Pigment Industry Association (dye industry) Shan Liangyu, Wang Pengcheng, were present. The Chamber of Commerce was presided over by Mr. Pan Shihao and Wu Jichun. First, Wang Boheng, representative of the pigment industry, stated that pigments and dyes are not only legally classified by the government long ago, but also distinguished in the latest chemical industry encyclopedia personally ordered by Minister Wang of the Ministry of Economic Affairs. All countries in the world also have special names that are not confused. In this city, the name of the dye shop is mistakenly used as the pigment shop, and the industry's public Zeng mistakenly called the pigment industry association, which makes the clearly distinguished pigments and dyes confused and undifferentiated. At this time of industrial nation-building, pigments and dyes are both important modern industrial commodities, and it is natural to suggest that the government quickly correct the pigment association that operates dyes to the dye industry association, and the pigment indigo brand to the dye indigo, so that the names match the reality and disputes will be forever resolved, and it is also consistent with the names of various countries. Otherwise, if the confusion is allowed to continue, not only will the buyers have nowhere to go, but it will also affect international trade and educational construction. Then, the representative of the dye industry stated that the commodity operated by the industry is indeed dye, but because the city is used to the habit, it is very inconvenient to correct it once, and it firmly refuses to change it. At this point, the representative of the Chamber of Commerce told that since the commodity operated by your industry is dye, the name of the association and the name of the shop should be corrected separately to focus on reality. However, because the industry firmly expressed dissent, even after repeated persuasion, the meeting still had no results. Afterwards, according to the reporter of the National Pigment and Sundry Goods Industry Association, pigments and dyes, regardless of commodities, nature, and use, are all different. The dye industry should not insist on sticking to habits and confusing them. In order to adapt to the actual situation, the industry will continue to request reasonable adjustments from the competent authorities and social experts.

### High Wages and High-Interest Exploitation; Silk Cocoon Industry is Difficult to Revive

According to a giant in the silk industry, the prosperity of my country's silk industry is not as good as that of Japan after the war. It is a well-known fact for the whole person. As for the secondary cocoon silk collection last year, due to high wages and the exploitation of high-interest loans, manufacturers suffered heavy losses. Although the government provided loans for relief and bought the spring silk produced at a price of 3.8 million, it still could not maintain it. The China Trust Bureau bought the finished silk and transported it to foreign countries to exchange for foreign exchange. Currently, the price of D-grade silk in the US market is 6.75 US dollars per pound, and each dan is calculated at 133 pounds, which is more than 800 US dollars. If you buy gold and transport it back (each silk can be exchanged for more than 20 taels of gold), the profit will be doubled after two handovers, resulting in a situation where the government makes money and farmers and businessmen lose money. If this continues, the revival of the silk cocoon industry will be very difficult.

### Ministry of Finance Plans to Establish Shenyang Customs

Part of the Northeast has been restored to order, and industry, commerce, import and export trade are also gradually becoming prosperous. In order to increase tax revenue, the Ministry of Finance will first establish Shenyang Customs, and establish branch customs in Changchun and Jin County. However, before September 18, Panyang did not have customs but was established in Dalian. Now Dalian is a free port. In terms of topography, Shenyang is located on the back of Dalian, so Dalian will not be established temporarily. There are also Binjiang, Yanji, and Andong in the Northeast. When the situation improves, they will all be established.

### Tianjin Yarn and Cloth Prices Soar

Yarn and cloth prices in Tianjin have been strong recently. Although the Central Textile Bureau has sold off, it has not fallen. It is reported that after the Shanghai Textile Control Committee raised the price of yarn, fine yarn suddenly rose. Shanghai gangs came here to purchase because Tianjin yarn was cheaper, which caused the price here to be firm. Due to the shortage of cotton cloth in Zhangsui and other places, the demand is urgent in this cold winter, and the price of cloth has soared, which is 15,000 yuan higher than Tianjin per piece. Therefore, there are many merchants who travel back and forth. It is heard that more than 50 packages of Zhang cloth are transported every day.

### Current Situation of Serge is Depressed; Predictions for After the New Year are Good

[Our Newspaper News] Recently, the prices of gold, white rice, cigarettes, silk cloth, kerosene, etc. have been rising continuously. Only Serge has not risen but fallen. The main reason is that in this port, those who are under pressure from high-interest loans and close their accounts have been heard every day. As the end of the year approaches, the silver root is tight, and banks and money shops are also closing down. Actual sales have become the end. American goods are pouring in, and those who buy out are numerous. People's hearts are weak. Mayerton's previous market price was prosperous all the way due to the delay in the issuance of the license. When a large number of peers arrived, the price gradually fell. Taking a comprehensive view of the market situation last month, it can be called a dull and tired situation, and American goods occupy a superior and important position in the current serge market. If all parties do not closely support and contact each other, it will be difficult for domestic goods to gain a foothold, and if high-interest loans are not eliminated, the business community will be in danger of bankruptcy. But in terms of the future of the serge industry, people in the industry predict that the market will definitely be good after the end of the Wanli period, because it is difficult to settle foreign exchange purchases, and it is not easy to apply for a license. It is bound to be a big shortage when ordering from foreign countries. The production of goods in this factory is affected by raw materials (because the import of wool is prohibited) and the payment of electricity, wages, donations and taxes. The cost is high and the output is bound to be small. Therefore, although the current price of serge is lower than the past peak, it is only a temporary phenomenon.

### Guizhou Longan Pulp is Short

Recently, the number of miscellaneous road Guizhou backlogs has been small. According to Quanzhou Telegraph, the price has risen by 60,000 yuan, so Shen City is slightly firm. Large grains open at 412,000 yuan to 420,000 yuan, ordinary grains are around 400,000 yuan, and medium grains are 255,000 yuan.

Due to the shortage of Guizhou longan pulp, there is a situation where rare goods can be stored. Recently, the number of disks opened over the past few days has been 700,000 yuan for Shima longan pulp.

### Chen Hèqín Departs Shenyang, Discusses Impressions of the Northeast

[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 12th] National education expert Chen Hèqín, having been invited by Xiong Shihui to Shenyang to inspect the rehabilitation of national education in the Northeast, has, in recent days, visited various schools and delivered two lectures to teachers at the Panyang National School. He is scheduled to depart for Peiping tonight and return to Shanghai. Mr. Chen told reporters that, due to the short amount of time and limited scope of his inspection, it was difficult to arrive at comprehensive conclusions. However, he was able to report the following: (1) Prior to the victory, Shenyang City had over twenty well-established national schools, but today only six of them are being utilized by us, resulting in the majority of children in Shenyang being out of school, a very serious problem. (2) Over the past fourteen years, education in the Northeast has inevitably fallen behind and should now actively enrich its educational content and catch up quickly. The physical condition of the teachers in general is excellent, and with diligent study and advancement, there is great hope for the future. (3) To rebuild education in the Northeast, it is essential to start with improving the quality of teachers, quickly establish normal colleges, and strengthen the training of existing teachers. In addition, the publication of educational journals and the creation of children's literature should be promoted to raise overall cultural standards.

The group will formulate systematic opinions and make recommendations to the central government.

### Students Above Senior High School to Undergo Centralized Military Training After This Year's Summer Vacation; Ministry of National Defense to First Assess Military Training Instructors

[This newspaper, Nanking, 12th] Students above senior high school will be required to undergo centralized military training starting after the summer vacation of the 36th year [1947]. The Ministry of National Defense has recently formulated four measures regarding the affiliation of military training instructors, which are described below: (1) The centralized training of students after graduating from high school or above will begin after the summer vacation of the 36th year [1947]. At that time, the existing military training (including military management) will be suspended. Until the centralized training begins, school military training will continue to be implemented according to law. It is appropriate that military training instructors be reserve officers. (2) The Fifth Bureau of the First Department of the Ministry of National Defense's Reserve Cadre Training and Management Office are both related to the management of military training instructors. In terms of management nature, the First Department is responsible for personnel policy planning and guidance, the Fifth Department is responsible for the planning of organization and training, and the Reserve Office is responsible for the implementation of policies. (3) Military training instructors will be assigned separately by the Ministry of National Defense and the Ministry of Education after military training is abolished. However, during the period before military training is abolished, the Reserve Office should first investigate the number of current military training instructors in schools nationwide, assess and organize them, and jointly formulate a resettlement plan with the Adjutant General's Office. (Outstanding personnel will be retained, while the remainder will be discharged or transferred, following the procedures for resettling demobilized officers). (4) Students who have undergone military training must participate in centralized training for one year after graduation. However, those who perform well after enlistment may have their enlistment education appropriately shortened.

### Small Education Advancement Association Hosted Guests from All Circles Yesterday

Demanding Assistance from the Press to Protect Professions

[This newspaper] The Shanghai Primary School Teachers' United Advancement Association hosted guests from all walks of life at the Hong Kong Road Bank Club yesterday to appeal for the protection of teachers' professions and to request assistance from the press. The association's chairman, Mr. Ge, reported that primary school teachers lead frugal lives and work hard. To fully realize the function of education, the primary task is to protect teachers' professions. The government has repeatedly issued clear orders, but recently a small number of primary schools in the city have terminated the employment of teachers without reason, which is contrary to the government's good intentions to protect teachers' professions. The association put forward concrete proposals, calling on society to pay attention: (1) Ask the education authorities to reiterate the laws on job protection. (3) Ask all school principals to jointly send letters of employment before the start of the semester, otherwise it will be regarded as renewal of employment. (3) The term of renewal is one academic year or three academic years. (4) Dismissing teachers must strictly comply with the laws and regulations of the Ministry of Education. It is said that the association is mostly composed of teachers from private primary schools, and the treatment of teachers is usually not bad.

Because the association has stated that the current teachers' monthly salary of only about 250,000 yuan is really difficult to maintain a family life, it immediately requested assistance from the municipal government authorities, and Mayor Wu expressed great sympathy, but due to the shortage of the municipal treasury and restrictions on the cases of the council, it was beyond his ability to help. After months of consultation, there was no result.

Temporarily Tolerating Hunger and Cold Rather Than Going on Strike

Therefore, it was inevitable to convene a general meeting of representatives from various schools, and it was decided to go on strike from the 6th of this month, but in view of the importance of students' studies, the director was sincerely moved and willing to endure hunger and cold and not bear the sin of being a famous teacher, and immediately made a general request for leave. However, in the future, the association is still determined to use the spirit of the past to implement this request and to ensure the minimum living standards of colleagues. Their ultimate goal is to use the price index as a multiple of salaries, asking the government to treat secondary school teachers as technicians and raise their salaries to the highest standards. In addition, the association has recently suggested to the Municipal Council that a teacher welfare fund be levied on students starting next semester, but the Director of Education, Gu, advocates that it be changed to a "teacher academic advancement subsidy" and that the funds be borne by the municipal treasury, but it still needs to be approved by the Municipal Council.

Hoping That the Mayor's Promise Will Be Fulfilled

Regarding the distribution of 500,000 yuan in winter clothing subsidies, Mayor Wu stated that there must be a precedent to follow and that there must be concrete evidence, and that news reports are not sufficient to prove it. Now the association feels that the mayor's statement is not entirely true, because the Secondary School Association is not a clearing team and cannot transfer documents, so how can it obtain evidence, so they hope that Mayor Wu can fully sympathize with the hardships of public teachers and maintain his consistent style as a politician and fulfill this promise.

### The Ever-Victorious Army First Encountered Waterloo: Donghua Lost to the Mixed Team 5-2, the Mixed Team Led Two to One in the First Half; Cui Shifu Paid Two Million Yuan to Bid on the Charity Ball

[This newspaper] The ever-victorious Donghua football team suffered its first crushing defeat in this charity match and the inter-port selection match, losing to the mixed team by one to five, with Donghua trailing one to two in the first half. Donghua's defense was weaker, and although the offense was fierce, the mixed team's steel gate was firmly defended, and the attacks were unsuccessful. There were an estimated five or six thousand spectators at the Yiyuan yesterday. The referee was Yue Xiurong, and the linesmen were He Chunhui and Chen Jixiang. During the break in the match, the charity ball was auctioned, and Cui Shifu, the president of the Longjie Sports Association, purchased it for a high price of two million yuan, and his benevolent and righteous act is commendable.

Defense Determines Victory or Defeat

The match began after the Nan Tong Orchestra finished playing "Under the Double Eagles Flag." Donghua, with six wins in six matches in the league, seemed to be facing the heroes with a newly crowned champion's posture. The cooperation of the whole team was tacit, and Han Longhai's speed was amazing. He built two miraculous achievements yesterday. Sun Jinshun's iron legs were still as good as ever. Although Donghua's offense was fierce, the mixed team's defense was strict. The two steel gates of goalkeepers McNitt and Dirati were invincible. When the iron legs met the steel gate, there was no way to break through. Yesterday's mixed team was full of talent. It was a charity match, and at the same time, it was a selection match for the inter-port representative team, so everyone showed off their skills and worked harder. Little Yellow Hair Robert Steev showed his heroic style as always. The victory or defeat yesterday was determined by the difference between the forwards of Donghua and the mixed team, while the defense of Donghua was far inferior to that of the mixed team, and there was no way to resist it. Mixed: McNitt (up), Dirati (down), Manyari, Steeb, Schoffer, Berni, Chen Xiaoping, Kapstein, Carlo Liech, Lei Shuping (down), Robert Stoff, Bao Jie (up), Zala. Donghua: Liu Xianhan, Li Ning (up), Zhuang Youren (down), Zhuang Youren (up), Lin Wenhu (down), Han Longbo, Tan Fuzhen, Yu Qiaoxing, Li Yao, Sun Jinshun, Dai Linjing (up), Han Longhai, Chen Mingzhe (down), Jia Youliang.

Donghua Fell in Five Minutes

As soon as the whistle blew, the match began. When the mixed team was just starting to cooperate and the communication was not yet skilled, Donghua's offense was frequent. Li Yao's first shot was slightly off and went out of bounds to the right. Then Youliang hooked the ball back from the bottom line, and Longhai dived and hooked a shot, which was also off to the right and missed. Donghua's entire army pushed forward, and the mixed team's Villa took the opportunity to bring the ball into the center. Carlo Liech caught it and kicked it hard, like a shooting star. Liu Xianhan stood on the right side of the goal in a horse-riding stance, but the ball entered from the left, and he could not save it and lost a city. It was only five minutes. The mixed team attacked again, and Yellow Hair flew the ball into the area and shot at the goal, slightly higher and hit the door frame and bounced back. The mixed generals crowded in, and Zhuang Youren calmly hooked the ball out while falling, turning danger into safety, which won a lot of applause. Donghua's generals were furious and led the three armies to cheer up and attack the mixed team's hinterland. Youliang shot twice, both of which were held by McNitt.

Tied and Then Fell Behind

Before long, Lin Gen sent a high ball from the rear, and Ade seemed to want to perform, leaped up in the air, and hooked the ball to Li Yao with his head, which was amazing. Li Yao caught it and kicked it hard, like a flat cannonball, flying straight to the left of the goal, but the steel gate McNitt, showing off not to let Linjing monopolize the front, flew forward and hugged the ball, showing it extremely wonderfully. At 25 minutes, Sun Iron Leg found a gap and passed it to Li Yao. He dribbled the ball straight in, and Longhai flew over and entered, tying the score at one each. Then the two sides fought fiercely and entered a mixed battle. At 40 minutes, Li Yao cut into the center, and McNitt rushed out and hugged the ball, running a few steps, and was judged to have hit the fence, and Iron Leg failed to take the penalty. Before the end of the first half, the ball turned around in front of Donghua's goal, and the generals of both sides were mixed into a group, fighting only to the point where people were turned upside down. The ball suddenly flew to the right, Kapstein's good opportunity came, and he looked around and found no one, pressed the ball down, described it accurately, and then built a success, and the first half was two to one, and Donghua fell behind.

Xianhan Went Backwards and Lost Four Chen

Changing sides and adjusting the generals to fight again, Dirati was transferred out of McNitt, and the mixed communication gradually began to take shape. At four minutes, Lei Shuping took the ball and advanced quickly along the side, passed it to Yellow Hair, crossed the two gates of Zhang and Zhuang, and kicked it in the air, slightly higher and hit the door frame and fell down. When Zhang Zhuang was welcoming, he touched it right, and confusedly bounced into the net, and gave another city back. At ten minutes, Yellow Hair got another ball from Youliang, just when the two guards Zhang and Zhuang were standing opposite, he brought the ball back, and flew his left foot, and hit the target again, four to one, Donghua lost four cities in a row, and the crowd was angry and launched a counterattack. Youliang Mingzhe, there were many attacks, Rati's business was booming, at fifteen minutes, Li Yao sent a corner kick, Chen Xiao Ping leaped up and topped it again and again, Hailong flew up and shot it, and was stopped by Rati, and then Youliang got the ball and cut it in, Hailong wanted to bloom on his head, but failed, hit the door frame and went out of bounds. At eighteen minutes, Berni passed the ball forward to Yellow Hair, and Lin Gen intercepted his path, Yellow Hair passed to the left, Villa's foot rose and the ball fell, flying into Donghua's net, five to one, the mixed team's world was set.

Not Willing to Take Back a City

Donghua was unwilling, and before long, Tie Zhui sent a high ball forward, and Rati rushed out to save the danger, Longhai was fast, and took the lead. He looked at an empty city, but his heart was high and the ball was also high, and it went over the door and out of bounds. Donghua continued to work hard. At 27 minutes, Hailong shot hard in front of the mixed team's goal. Rati did not defend this move, so he was attacked and scored, making it two to five. After that, the two sides attacked and defended each other. Donghua's five forwards advanced, but the mixed team's foreigners were strong and strong, and they did not win in the end. By the time the statutory time ended, the ever-victorious army was miserably attacked by the mixed team by two to five.

### Correction Letter

(1) Regarding your newspaper's December 1st Bangkok special dispatch, the report on the severe restrictions on Siamese compatriots educating their children contained malicious attacks involving Ambassador Li. For example, it was said that he initially adopted a wait-and-see attitude. In fact, Ambassador Li presented his credentials on September 17th and convened a symposium on overseas Chinese education issues on the 19th. Subsequently, the Education Association and various school principals submitted written opinions. Ambassador Li immediately used these as a basis for negotiations with the Siamese Foreign Minister. The Siamese Foreign Ministry agreed that the Director of the Ministry of Education's Department of Public Education and the First Secretary of the Cultural Affairs Section of the Embassy, Ouyang Chun, would discuss the details. All of this is verifiable with local newspapers and archives. Furthermore, the claim that he continued to tour seaside resorts and refused to meet with representatives of the overseas Chinese community is also fabricated. Ambassador Li has been in office for more than three months and has not even visited the old capital, Ayutthaya, which is only a two-hour journey away. In Bangkok, foreign envoys often drive to the seaside for weekend relaxation, but Ambassador Li, due to busy official duties, continues to work on Sundays and has not had a single weekend of seaside rest. Local newspapers here record Ambassador Li's words and deeds daily. Please check all Bangkok newspapers to see if there is any news of Ambassador Li visiting seaside resorts. As for refusing to meet with representatives, this is even more unfounded. Ambassador Li has stipulated that he will receive guests on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday afternoons, and it can be said that he does not refuse anyone who comes. The fact that your newspaper's reporter made such a statement is clearly intended to slander and frame. The report claimed that public opinion was critical, the overseas Chinese community was indignant, and telegrams were sent to the central government requesting that it order a forceful assertion of their rights, but it is unknown on what basis this claim is made. We hereby request that you investigate and correct this matter. The Embassy of the Republic of China in Siam (December 28th, Year 35) (2) Upon reviewing your newspaper's December 1st, Year 35 publication regarding the alleged neglect of the Chinese education issue by our Embassy in Siam, which supposedly caused great dissatisfaction among the overseas Chinese community and drew criticism from public opinion, we find that this does not align with the facts. Since his arrival, Ambassador Li has been deeply concerned about Chinese education. On the third day after presenting his credentials, he convened an education symposium to solicit opinions from all parties. He then proposed flexible measures to the Siamese government to resolve the Chinese education issue. Subsequently, due to the Siamese side's delay in responding, he sent three official notes to the Siamese government urging a reply. Because the Chinese schools greatly valued Ambassador Li's attention to this issue and his efforts in negotiations, they expressed trust in him. Therefore, when the Siamese authorities recently forcibly ordered registration according to the old regulations, the responsible persons of various schools gathered at the embassy and unanimously decided to support the embassy in order to achieve the goal of revising the regulations to benefit Chinese education. There were never any direct telegrams to the government expressing dissatisfaction. As the report contains information that is inconsistent with the facts, we are writing to request a correction. Representatives: Li Zhengyuan of the Zhonghua Pingmin School, Chen Zeyi of the Lianyi School, Wang Xuehua of the Sanmin Gongxue, Lin Huijun of the Shude Girls' School, Zhi Xiong of the Qingnian Gongxue, and Li Zhihong and others from Qixin and 49 other schools.

### New York's Year-End Scene: The Heart of the World Beats Faster, "New Yorkers" Are Exhausted. Prediction: The City's Population Will Exceed Ten Million in Five Years.

— New York Airmail Dispatch, December 25th. Our Correspondent in the United States, Mao Shuqing

On the afternoon of three days before Christmas, snowflakes fluttered all over New York. A cold wind swept across the city from the Hudson River, stirring the mottled fallen leaves on both sides of the road. The silver-white world brought novelty to "New Yorkers" and a sense of the New Year.

American children, wearing bright red velvet clothes, skied, skated, and had snowball fights everywhere. Middle-aged and elderly people did not huddle up because of the "first snow." On the contrary, because of the holidays, people seemed even busier.

Busy with Gifts: Post Office Opens Day and Night Shifts

Radio stations constantly broadcast Christmas gift advertisements. Clever merchants turned everything into "holiday gifts." Pajamas for five dollars a set, nylon stockings for one and a half dollars a pair, and chocolate candies for eighty-five cents a box were wrapped in shiny red and green paper and placed in mailing boxes for gifts. The post office opened day and night shifts, hired temporary staff, and in front of the package windows, there was a long line of people. They only needed to pay postage of twenty or thirty cents to safely deliver a large package of holiday gifts to their relatives' homes.

In a capitalist society, everything is a commodity, and commodities become tools for gift-giving. Cultural enterprises are no exception. "Reader's Digest" placed large advertisements in theaters and newspapers, saying, "The most ideal gift for the New Year is a subscription to Reader's Digest for the whole year." Many women's and family magazines designed various inexpensive, beautiful, and pleasing gifts for thousands of housewives.

The intersection of Broadway and 34th Street is like the corner of Nanjing Road and Xizang Road in Shanghai. There are three of New York's largest department stores: "Macy's," "Saks," and "Gimbels." The escalator-style elevators, like those in the Great Sun Department Store, were crowded with people going up and down. Countless goods, including clothing, food, daily necessities, and toys for children, and countless banknotes were constantly flying around. Most of the customers were housewives, but there were also many elderly ladies in their seventies and eighties, wearing tens of thousands of styles of hats, none of which were exactly the same, and wearing clothes of different colors, weaving through the crowds. God created Christmas with deep meaning, and he must have seen those devout "common people" and smiled.

Times Square: Filled with Red Lights and Green Wine

Santa Claus came to this largest city in the world very early. In Greater New York, hundreds of thousands of glass windows were decorated with "Santa Claus." In Times Square, the gospel of Santa Claus, broadcast by loudspeakers, poured into the ears of the crowds of pedestrians. This small area is always back-to-back and shoulder-to-shoulder from morning until three or four in the morning. Even on snowy nights, it is still bustling. Many young girls from rural America, as soon as they step into New York, find a policeman and ask: "Excuse me, can you tell me how to get to Times Square?"

They mostly meet drunken sailors in Times Square (also translated as Times Square), and sailors' music is broadcast in every corner of the bar. A nickel is inserted into the coin-operated jukebox, and five minutes of decadent music can be enjoyed. Whiskey, sherry, cognac... wine is the lifeblood of American children. The smell of wine, rouge, and perfume is mixed together.

Airship Reflecting Snow: A Spectacular Sight in the Sky

Colorful neon lights illuminate the city day and night. Advertisements for cold drinks in the summer still flash in a corner of Times Square. The electric news reports in the New York Times are several hours faster than reading the next day's newspaper. The street cartoons often attract newly arrived tourists who stop to watch.

The war is over, and airships have become the best advertising tool for department stores. At night, the airships carry electric light advertisements for Christmas gifts and slowly circle in the sky above Times Square. On snowy nights, the lights of the airship, reflecting the snowy scenery, become a spectacular sight in the sky.

Coal Mine Strike: New York Orders Power Conservation

The person New Yorkers fear the most is probably coal miner John L. Lewis. When New Yorkers talk about Lewis and his thick eyebrows, they have a bit of a "talk-tiger-turns-pale" expression. No one can control the neon lights of the New York Times, but with just one word from Lewis, those neon lights go out. Last month, Lewis suddenly ordered 400,000 coal miners to strike. New York Mayor O'Dwyer immediately ordered electricity conservation. Neon lights were all "dimmed." Times Square was dark for two or three weeks. The mayor's order was to save coal to resist Lewis's strike in the long term. Two companies secretly turned on their advertising lights and were severely fined by the city government.

The day Lewis ordered the workers to return to work, many New York businessmen jumped for joy. When businessmen are happy, New York society seems to come alive. The business community is paramount in a commercial society, and the business community is the backbone of society.

Population Soars: The City Center Cannot Accommodate It Well

The prosperity that the war brought to the United States cannot be calculated in numbers. The population of New York is about to exceed eight million. The original urban form of New York is already showing signs of being unable to accommodate it. Let's not even talk about the serious "housing shortage." The traffic rules alone have already given the city government a headache. The United States is the "mother's home" of the automobile industry. It is unknown how many millions of cars there are in New York City. Therefore, marching and parking have become problems. More than three months ago, the mayor ordered that parking on the side of the road be absolutely prohibited in the city center, from 23rd Street to 59th Street, except on Saturday evenings and Sundays. Many people broke the law and were fined fifteen dollars.

New Plan: Building Underground Parking Lots

As a result, many car owners would rather lock up their cars and not use them. The subway trains, from early morning to evening, from dusk to the next day's dawn, are always crowded like sardines. The few parking lots in the city center, like stars in the morning sky, charge seventy-five cents for an hour of parking, but they are always full of cars. Two months ago, Mayor O'Dwyer took a trip to San Francisco and was very impressed with the "underground parking lots" there. When he returned, he decided to build three large-scale underground parking lots in New York, each capable of parking 20,000 cars at the same time. However, the plan is in place, but "we hear the sound of footsteps on the stairs, but no one comes down!"

Drive Carefully: Radio Broadcasts on Snowy Nights

Traffic in Shanghai is a problem; traffic control in New York is an even bigger problem. Although the signals of the traffic lights are so clear, car accidents are almost unavoidable at any time. Americans are naturally impatient. Even though there is a red light ahead, many cars still try to run it, and pedestrians try to run it. In Washington, the city government has a regulation that if you cross the street at a red light, you must be fined ten dollars. But in New York, the more you can cross under a red light, the more you are a "hero" who can get things done. People who drive cars in New York honk their horns at every turn. Sometimes, when a long line of cars is moving, and the first car stops, the horns behind it sound like a road music concert. These situations are absolutely not seen in England or France. "America is too young a country," many middle-aged or elderly people who have come from Europe exclaim!

Everyone is busy at the end of the year, and those who are already impatient are inevitably even more so. The snow three days before Christmas further hindered their scheduled transportation. At LaGuardia Airport, one hundred and thirteen civil aviation planes could not take off due to heavy snow. Many people who had originally planned to spend Christmas in Miami or Los Angeles temporarily changed their plans. Trains in New York were at least an hour late because of the snow, so they were all running slowly. The city government's traffic officer said so euphemistically: "Be careful of the snow under your wheels. There are already two inches of snow in New York City! In Upper New York (i.e., upstate New York), there are up to eight inches. The snow is so slippery, quickly reduce your speed, slowly, slowly. Even so, you will be an hour late, but isn't safety more important?"

However, the next day was finally revealed. Overnight, there were a total of twenty-six car crashes and rollovers in Greater New York City due to snow.

Queue for Tickets: Long Enough to Circle Several Blocks

The reporter also originally planned to drive to the Virginia coast to spend Christmas, but the snow hindered our plan.

Spending the New Year in New York is lonely. Many people who make a living in New York return to their hometowns for the holidays. But on the other hand, the New Year in New York is also lively. Around Christmas, theaters are packed every night. It is harder to buy tickets for the small-scale opera house than anything else. Several small theaters around Times Square are showing popular new films: "Newlyweds and Widows," "Dear Clementine," and the cartoon "Song of the South," etc. Every show is crowded. The world's largest movie theater, "Radio City Music Hall," in addition to showing movies, is also staging this year's greatest Christmas song and dance performance. The queue for tickets is long enough to circle several blocks, not only on Sundays but also on Mondays and Tuesdays. The actress Ingrid Bergman, who is frantically worshiped by American society, was recently hired from Los Angeles to New York for a large sum of money to perform in a play at a theater. It is said that the tickets for reservations have already been sold out until February of next year.

The World's Capital Will Take Shape in New York

The world's largest city is crowded with the world's largest scenes. At the end of the year, the city government is also undergoing renovations. Many people hate trams because they are too dirty and noisy. Now many have been cancelled. New-style red and yellow public buses parade along Broadway. In the middle of the discussion about moving the United Nations capital away from New York, New Yorkers felt a bit "slowed down" and "lost face." Mayor O'Dwyer tightly held onto the big financier Rockefeller, the grandson of the oil tycoon, who generously donated eight and a half million dollars to the United Nations to buy land along the East River, saying that a future world capital will be built in the most prosperous area in the world - Manhattan. "In five years, the population of New York will definitely exceed ten million," I saw a small newspaper predict this.

Delegations from Various Countries Move into Buildings One After Another

At the end of the year, delegations from various countries stationed at the United Nations are busy moving. The United States government, in order to make it easier for delegations from various countries to gather and do business, has specially allocated the 63rd, 64th, and 65th floors of the "skyscraper" as New York's "East Legation Quarter." The Chinese delegation has reserved 7,500 square feet of land on the 63rd floor, with a monthly rent of $7,000. It is said that the British delegation has rented 20,000 square feet, and their layout and grandeur are certainly more spectacular.

Undoubtedly, New York is now the heart of the world, and the pulse of the heart every minute and every second affects the dynamics of the whole world. 1946 will soon be over. The eight million New Yorkers are looking forward to a more prosperous, more stable, and wealthier 1947! (Posted on Christmas Eve)

### Three Major Problems in Sichuan: Corruption, Opium, and Bandits

Airmail dispatch December 27th. Our correspondent in Chengdu, Zhou Xueduan

The weather is cold, the wind is freezing, and the end of the year is near! After continuous winter rains, the climate in Chengdu is even colder. These few days, the Sichuan Provincial Assembly is holding its third conference. In a corner of the cold wind, councilors from various counties brought the mournful voices of 50 million people in Sichuan. From these voices, we hear the gloomy, turbid, and unstable social melodies of Sichuan in recent years. This is like a cold current that further lowers the cruel atmosphere of the Sichuan climate.

This year is the year of demobilization. Sichuan, after eight years of war, is striving for stability and restoration amidst extreme turmoil. However, this year, the provincial government's focus has been on the planning and promotion of construction in recent years. In addition, the civil unrest has not yet ended, the flames of war have not ceased, and the national order has not been fully stabilized. The basic order of Sichuan society has not been stabilized and restored. The proceedings of the Provincial Assembly in the past few days included policy reports by the Acting Chairman of the Provincial Government, Bu Xixia, and the heads of various departments, as well as inquiries from the councilors. From the reports, we can indeed see the various political progresses in Sichuan in recent years. From the inquiries, we can see the various malpractices in Sichuan society. Due to these two contradictory comparisons, the reporter feels that there is still a disconnect between the current government and society in Sichuan, which reflects the general situation of chaos and instability in Sichuan society.

Eliminating Corruption and Rectifying Political Ethics

At the opening of the Provincial Assembly, Councilor Zeng Shengzhai, who is in his seventies, made a poignant speech, pointing out that the three most serious problems in Sichuan today are opium, bandits, and corruption. The current social phenomena in Sichuan are bandits everywhere, the people are not living, bribery is rampant, corruption is prevalent, and opium is rampant. In the eastern counties of Sichuan, not only opium is everywhere, but also heroin, morphine, and sosso are everywhere. The first priority is to clarify official governance and eliminate corruption. Regarding the rectification of political ethics and corruption cases, the councilors' inquiries were the most intense. The head of civil affairs, Chen Kaisai, was the first to bear the brunt. Corruption by county magistrates has long been regarded as commonplace in Sichuan. After the cases occur, the provincial government only issues a document to transfer them, which is the most dissatisfied with the whole province. For example, in the remote and poor Ma'ai Governing Bureau in Sichuan Province, the first Director, Li Weile, recently embezzled more than 6.77 million yuan in fraudulently claimed salaries for staff, more than 650 dan of rice and yellow millet, more than 1,100 dan of illegally collected land taxes, and embezzled more than 26 million yuan in township savings alliance victory public bond donations, deed taxes, and soldiers' family settlement expenses. He also contributed more than 1,000 dan of grain externally. He is now being transferred to Mochuan. However, he is still being detained by local people. Another example is the embezzlement of special project funds by the former Hejiang County Magistrate, which amounted to hundreds of millions. Months after the case occurred, there is still no news. Other corruption cases are numerous, and it has never been heard that the government has taken thorough action. Furthermore, regarding the issue of political ethics, the county magistrate should set an example for the county and should be cautious in his conduct. The councilors exposed the scandalous affairs of two current county magistrates. One is Zeng Zhongcheng, the county magistrate of Kaixian, because his fiancée was too scandalous in the local area, causing him to be uneasy in his post. The other is Huang Xilian, the county magistrate of Neijiang, because he had a dispute with his wife, which resulted in head injuries and a city-wide scandal. Another example is the county magistrates arbitrarily disregarding human lives. For example, Li Caigui, the county magistrate of Gusong, wrongly killed three innocent young people, treating the people like rags, which aroused public outrage throughout the county. This series of examples illustrates the corruption of political ethics and the prevalence of corruption in Sichuan today. Regarding finance, the fiscal system of Sichuan Province was reformed this year, and most of the direct taxes were assigned to the local governments. The new tax bureaus in various counties are extremely large, and tax collection is inevitably prone to malpractices. The councilors asked the Director of the Finance Department, Deng Hanxiang, to show his conscience and guarantee that tax officials would not engage in corruption. Director Deng simply replied: "I can only guarantee myself." Inquiries on civil affairs and finance occupied two days of the conference, with more than sixty inquiries, mainly involving corruption and political ethics. The general councilors agreed that the current promotion of public administration in Sichuan depends on the thorough clarification of official governance and the rectification of official conduct. In addition to providing facts about corruption, they unanimously hoped that the government's selection, appointment, assessment, reward, and dismissal of county magistrates could have legal standards. The emoluments for county magistrates should have a real guarantee. However, most importantly, thorough and strict law enforcement should be continued for corruption. This is the most urgent appeal and demand of the people of Sichuan today.

Nothing is More Urgent Than Security

The councilors from various counties, based on their personal experiences, made urgent appeals regarding the issue of security in Sichuan after demobilization. Some even wept and reported with tears in their eyes. The current security situation in Sichuan is caused by the rampant banditry. Large and small gangs of bandits appear and disappear without a fixed location. Carjacking and field robberies are commonplace. Those with more than a thousand guns include the giant bandit Hu Guoguang in the fifth district, the giant bandit Qu Baijie in the eighth district, the giant bandit Ling Boqing in the fourteenth district, and the giant bandit Ma Shiyi in the sixteenth district. They gather in the mountains and forests, run rampant in the countryside, and have been a scourge for years, but have not yet been suppressed. How can the Security Department justify itself? The second is the military discipline of the security forces. The councilors pointed out that the security teams in various places often use their power to harass the people, and even harbor opium, collude with local evil forces, and commit evil deeds. Before ensuring security, they disturb the people. Has the government paid attention to this harm? Councilor Wang Baomin even wept and begged Acting Chairman Deng and Wang Yuanhui, Director of the Security Department, to have the bodhisattva's heart of saving people and the world, and to quickly stabilize security and relieve the people.

In his reply, Director Wang Yuanhui reported on the "achievements" of this year's suppression of bandits throughout Sichuan. He said that 93 major and minor bandit leaders had been killed or captured this year, 1,540 bandits had been captured, 410 guns had been seized, including machine guns and rifles, and 168 kidnapped people had been rescued. Under the instructions of Chairman Deng, a general encirclement and suppression is currently being carried out throughout Sichuan, and it is certain that the banditry in Sichuan can be gradually eliminated soon.

The people of Sichuan, after eight years of hardship and suffering in the war of resistance, are most urgently in need of stability and rest. This is the unanimous opinion of the councilors. However, the biggest obstacle to social stability is the rampant banditry, which causes extreme social unrest and extreme insecurity for the people. It is also the biggest scourge in Sichuan today. "Eliminating bandits and stabilizing society," "Nothing is more urgent than security." This is the unanimous call of 50 million people in Sichuan.

The Spread of Opium Throughout Sichuan

Another malpractice that is poisoning Sichuan society in parallel with bandits is opium. Originally, the government had planned to completely ban opium in Sichuan in the next two years. At the same time, the promotion of the opium ban this year has been spared no effort. However, those who ban ban, and those who violate violate. The councilors unanimously lamented that the law is too lenient for the opium ban. The Director of the Opium Prohibition Department reported on the achievements of this year's opium ban at the Assembly, pointing out that this year, 31,000 mu of opium seedlings have been eradicated in the Songli Maowen area in southwest Sichuan and the Pingwu Qingchuan area in northern Sichuan, and more than 10,000 opium offenders have been arrested. However, opium is still lurking and spreading everywhere.

The councilors came from various counties and reported on the spread of opium in various villages and towns, especially the tolerance and indulgence of special evil forces. They gnashed their teeth with hatred. The councilors from northern Sichuan pointed out that the amount of opium planted by force in Wangcang can be ranked first in the country. The councilors from eastern Sichuan pointed out that the morphine smuggled in by ships entering Sichuan and the originally popular opium are rampant in every corner, making eastern Sichuan almost a poisoned world today. In addition to the government's determination to completely ban opium, are there any effective measures to prevent the harboring of evil forces?

Sichuan society is already fragmented and unbearable in the midst of chaos. How can it be poisoned again? The councilors, on behalf of the people of Sichuan, issued an earnest and painful appeal.

Combining the voices issued by the councilors on behalf of the people of Sichuan, it is believed that "nothing is more urgent than stability" in Sichuan today. Let the people live and work in peace. Although the construction plans advocated by the authorities are far-sighted and magnificent, it seems that they should address the urgent needs. First, thoroughly clarify and eradicate the three major problems in Sichuan today - corruption, bandits, and opium - so that Sichuan can seek progress and gradually develop after social stability. Otherwise, the cold current of the three problems will make the spring of the people of Sichuan come late. This is the call of the representatives of the people of Sichuan and the unanimous urgent demand of 50 million people throughout Sichuan.

### The Future of Taiwan's Hydroelectric Power Industry

— Mao Ronglin

Taiwan Island is one of the two largest islands in southeastern China, located between 120 and 121 degrees east longitude and 22 to 25.5 degrees north latitude. It faces Fujian Province across the sea, less than 100 miles away. It has an area of 35,847 square kilometers and a coastline of 9,440 kilometers, with a Han Chinese population of 4,734,000. The indigenous population (including "raw" and "heated" aborigines) numbers 148,000. Originally our country's territory, Han people migrated there during the Tang and Song dynasties. In the late Ming dynasty, when Zheng Chenggong occupied Taiwan to resist the Qing dynasty, even more people from the southeast settled there. After the Qing dynasty unified the island, it was initially changed to Taiwan Prefecture, under the jurisdiction of Fujian Province, and later changed to Taiwan Province. Even today, people from Fujian and Guangdong still account for more than 90% of Taiwan's population. After China's defeat in the Sino-Japanese War in 1895, Taiwan was ceded to Japan. After 50 years of Japanese management, the value of production in 1937 reached 310 million Japanese yen, more than doubling the 147 million Japanese yen in 1928. Compared to the income of only one million yuan when it was part of our country, it increased several hundredfold. Since the July 7th Incident, Japan's southward expansion policy has gradually been completed. To meet its military needs, it has more actively developed Taiwan's resources. In the past eight years, Taiwan's hydroelectric power industry and industrial and mining construction have made achievements and are quite large in scale. Not only is the former Taiwan far behind, but it has also jumped to an important position in today's southeastern maritime national defense economic zone. Last September, Japan surrendered unconditionally, and Taiwan returned to the embrace of the motherland under our country's victory. From now on, its mission is not only to be a barrier for the southeastern coastal provinces of our country, a hub for naval and air forces in the north and south, but also a base for establishing permanent peace in the Pacific. How can we allow ourselves to ignore it any longer?

During the Japanese rule of Taiwan, its economic policy was entirely colonial in nature, only encouraging Taiwanese to work hard to produce large quantities of rice, sugar, tea, and fruit to supply the needs of the Japanese mainland. It imported its mainland's surplus industrial products, such as fertilizers, textiles, and other manufactured goods, to Taiwan in order to extract huge profits. After the July 7th Incident, as Taiwan became a naval and air base, it actively developed military industries. Therefore, its economic policy also changed to a strategic one. Factories such as aluminum refining, oil refining, calcium carbide, steel, alloys, rubber, alcohol, and shipbuilding were all resolutely established and expanded as much as possible, flourishing like bamboo shoots after a rain. As for the production of coal, gold, steel, and other mines, a foundation had already been laid before the war, and it was further expanded during the war. All these rapid advances related to military industries relied on the development and supply of power resources. Therefore, Japan spared no effort in surveying and developing Taiwan's water resources. According to the report of the Taiwan Power Company, Taiwan's water resources can be developed up to more than 3 million kilowatts, of which at least 2 million kilowatts can be economically utilized. The Japanese government had a ten-year plan to develop 1 million kilowatts, which began in 1932. The core of this plan was the Dajia River project, which had the largest scale, with a total of eight power plants and a generating capacity of 450,000 kilowatts. Three of these were already under construction. In addition, the Taiwan Power Company was organized to uniformly manage Taiwan's power industry in order to achieve the government's control goals. The company's capital of 300 million Japanese yen was a joint venture between the government and private businesses, with the Taiwan Governor-General's Office contributing one-eighth of the capital, and the rest from private businesses. However, the right to operate was entirely controlled by the Japanese government. The president, vice president, and directors were all appointed by the Governor-General, and the operating policies were also stipulated by the Japanese government. In terms of equipment, there were 34 completed power plants throughout Taiwan, with a total installed generating capacity of approximately 320,000 kilowatts, including 26 hydroelectric power plants of various sizes, with a total generating capacity of approximately 270,000 kilowatts. The largest of these was the first Sun Moon Lake plant, which had a generating capacity of 100,000 kilowatts and was completed in 1934. There were eight thermal power plants, with a total of approximately 50,000 kilowatts, the largest of which was the northern Dalin power plant, used to supplement power during the dry season and for temporary emergencies.

After 1941, the Japanese government more actively developed Taiwan's water resources. There were nine projects under construction, with a total installed generating capacity of approximately 270,000 kilowatts. Among these, three projects were mostly completed, with a total generating capacity of 110,000 kilowatts. Towards the end of the war, starting in October 1944, the U.S. Air Force repeatedly bombed the first and second power plants at Sun Moon Lake, causing damage. The bombing was most severe in April 1945, completely destroying all the auxiliary substations and slightly affecting the water pipelines. Fortunately, the power plants themselves suffered little damage, and all the machines were intact. The eastern Xikou power plant was also destroyed by bombing. In addition, secondary substations and wheel power distribution equipment in various places were damaged. Although they could still maintain power generation after repairs, the capacity was greatly reduced. In the summers and autumns of 1944 and 1945, Taiwan was hit by typhoons, followed by widespread landslides. The Wushe, Tiansongbei, and Wanda power plants in the west were all damaged. The eight large and small hydroelectric power plants in the east were also severely hit. The riverbeds were filled with sand and gravel, reaching as high as 16 meters, and almost all were destroyed. When we victoriously took over, Taiwan's power supply capacity had been reduced to only 42,000 kilowatts, barely one-tenth of the generating capacity during peacetime. This was the main reason.

After Taiwan's restoration, our government immediately began the takeover. First, the Taiwan Electricity Supervision Committee was organized, with Liu Jin-yu as the chairman and Huang Hui as the vice chairman. On November 9, 1945, supervision began. The important measures were as follows: (1) Strictly supervise employees to rush to repair the damaged projects day and night, and temporarily move the transformers with lighter loads to Sun Moon Lake to cope with the current power supply to factories throughout the province, while reducing thermal power generation to save coal consumption in Taiwan. (2) Improve the power distribution equipment in various counties and cities to ensure the safety of power supply. (3) Compile restoration and expansion plans for hydroelectric power. The restoration aspect is divided into two phases: the first phase is to increase from 42,000 kilowatts to 100,000 kilowatts, to be completed within three months; the second phase is to increase from 100,000 kilowatts to 200,000 kilowatts, to be completed within one year. The expansion aspect is also divided into two phases: the first phase is to expand 100,000 kilowatts, and the total generating capacity will be 300,000 kilowatts after completion, to be completed within three years; the second phase is to expand 200,000 kilowatts, and the total generating capacity will be 500,000 kilowatts after completion, to be completed within five years. Currently, the first phase of the restoration plan has been completed as scheduled, and a part of the second phase has also been completed. The total power generation has reached more than 180,000 kilowatts, exceeding the current needs of various factories. After all repairs are completed in the future, it will be sufficient to supply power to all factories before the war. As for the expansion plan, it is currently in the preparation stage of design and drawing. (4) Select outstanding Taiwanese employees, establish Mandarin tutoring classes, and conduct various professional training to cultivate cadres and achieve the goal of recruiting local talent. (5) Because the projects on the Dajia River were suspended, and the power plants in the east were shut down, many of the original employees were idle. After reorganization, more than 800 people were laid off, and more than 1,100 Japanese employees were dismissed to save expenses and increase work efficiency. (6) Control finances, strictly implement budgets and final accounts, clear accounts, and determine equity so that financial administration gradually gets on the right track.

On March 20, 1946, it was ordered to be renamed the Taiwan Electricity Takeover Committee to carry out further takeover work. During this period, the Takeover Committee took the following measures: (1) Recruit talent from within the country and Taiwan Province to assume important positions, so that the technical and business aspects can continue to develop without interruption. (2) Carefully retain Japanese technical employees, encourage them with service ethics, treat them equally, and allow them to work with peace of mind. (3) The factories and offices are scattered in various places, and the security is unstable, with thefts occurring from time to time. Entrust the police department to train police officers and establish a guard team to be dispatched to various places to maintain protection. (4) Plan to continue the construction of the unfinished civil engineering part of the Wulai Hydroelectric Power Plant. (5) Electrical equipment in Taiwan Province was mostly hidden or smuggled out after the restoration, and it was difficult to replenish, which greatly affected the power industry. Therefore, a request was submitted to the Governor-General's Office to work with relevant parties to strictly prohibit the export of metal equipment and electrical materials to remedy the situation.

In April 1946, the Takeover Committee was established. Director Qian Changzhao of the Resources Commission came to Taiwan and discussed the operating principles with Governor Chen Yi of the Province. A board of directors was organized, with Director Chen Zhongxi of the Power Industry Department of the Resources Commission as the chairman, and Director Liu Jin-yu was appointed as the acting general manager, and Directors Huang Hui and Liu Deyu as acting assistant managers. On May 1, 1946, it was ordered to establish the Taiwan Power Company (referred to as Taiwan Power Company) first. Under the general manager and assistant manager, there are seven departments: mechanical and electrical, civil engineering, planning, general affairs, business, management, and accounting. The original twelve branch offices throughout Taiwan were reorganized into district offices. The power plants, substations, repair shops, and electrical meter testing laboratories and high-voltage testing laboratories were still established. The heads of each department and the supervisors of each unit were also appointed one after another, and the personnel gradually became sound.

In terms of engineering, the focus is on actively repairing the equipment damaged during the war. Therefore, the first task is to repair the Sun Moon Lake Hydroelectric Power Plant, with the goal of achieving a generating capacity of 200,000 kilowatts by the end of this year. In addition, we are contacting foreign countries to purchase prize transformers and switch equipment to strengthen transmission capacity. As for the expansion, the Wulai Hydroelectric Power Plant Engineering Office was established first to continue construction and build the unfinished parts of the project.

In terms of business, because the cost of repairs is huge and prices are rising, in order to balance revenue and expenditure and maintain power supply operations, it is necessary to slightly adjust electricity prices. At the same time, the district offices are urged to strengthen the collection, meter reading, management, and contracting shops to make it convenient for users and increase revenue, which can be parallel and not contradictory.

In the past, materials were imported from Japan. In the future, Taiwan Province must be self-sufficient. This is the goal of developing Taiwan Province's economy in the future. Therefore, the operation and development of various agricultural, industrial, and mining products such as chemical fertilizers, oil refining, steelmaking, shipbuilding, sugar manufacturing, papermaking, salt making, cement, calcium carbide, and coal, gold, and copper all require a large supply of electricity. For example, the electrolytic production of one ton of ammonium sulfate fertilizer requires 3,600 kilowatt-hours of electricity (one degree equals one kilowatt-hour), one ton of calcium carbide requires 3,500 kilowatt-hours of electricity, and one ton of caustic soda requires 3,400 kilowatt-hours of electricity. In addition, sugar production, which had a maximum annual output of 1.4 million tons in the past, requires 74,600 kilowatts (equivalent to 100,000 horsepower) of electricity. In addition, rural electrification irrigation projects, city trams, and railway electrification all require a large amount of electricity. Preliminary estimates by experts believe that the total power generation in Taiwan must reach at least 300,000 kilowatts within three years, and at least 500,000 kilowatts within five years, to meet the needs of Taiwan Province's industrialization [see the attached table of estimated power needs in Taiwan Province's five-year construction plan]. Therefore, the promotion of Taiwan Province's hydroelectric power industry in the future must be gradually expanded based on this principle, hoping to achieve the above figures as scheduled. The following is a summary of the future expansion plan:

(1) Complete the Wulai, Tianleng, Wushe, and Sanshui hydroelectric power projects:

(1) Wulai Hydroelectric Power Plant Project—95% of the civil engineering part of the project has been completed, and a 12,500-kilowatt turbine generator set has been shipped and is expected to be installed and put into operation within six months.

(2) Tianleng Hydroelectric Power Plant Project—This project is one of the Dajia River plans. 70% of the civil engineering part has been completed. It is planned to complete all the civil engineering by the end of 1947, and two 26,000-kilowatt turbine generator sets have been ordered from the United States for installation and power supply.

(3) Wushe Hydroelectric Power Plant Project—The plant building and power generation equipment of this project have been fully completed, and 70% of the water channel has also been completed. However, only 5% of the reservoir dam has been completed. It is planned to continue construction to completion to prepare for power generation.

(2) Add the Nanshi, Zhudong, Fengyuan, and Meiji four hydroelectric power plants:

(1) Nanshi Hydroelectric Power Plant Project—This project is located in the upper reaches of the Nanshi River in Taipei County, with a drop of 130 meters. The planned power generation capacity is 20,000 kilowatts. The transportation road has been mostly completed, and it is planned to complete the entire project and supply power within three years.

(2) Zhudong Hydroelectric Power Plant Project—This project is located in the Touqian River in Hsinchu County, with a drop of 224 meters. The planned power generation capacity is 21,000 kilowatts. The preliminary design has been completed, and it is planned to complete the construction and supply power within four years.

(3) Fengyuan No. 1 Hydroelectric Power Plant Project—This project is one of the Dajia River plans, with a drop of 105 meters. The planned power generation capacity is 51,200 kilowatts. A part of the transverse pit of the tunnel has been excavated, and it is planned to complete all of it and supply power within four years.

(4) Meiji Hydroelectric Power Plant Project—This project is also one of the Dajia River plans, with a drop of 174 meters. The planned power generation capacity is 71,000 kilowatts. A part of the preparatory work for each project has been completed, and the tunnel pit has also started construction. It is planned to complete all of it and supply power within five years.

(3) Expand the Northern Thermal Power Plant

Taiwan's hydroelectric power generation, due to terrain and rainfall, requires considerable supplementation and regulation from thermal power generation. Based on past experience, the various large and small thermal power plants must be fired up to supply power for an average of four months each year. It is planned to add a 35,000-kilowatt steam turbine generator in the northern thermal power plant to prevent power interruptions during the dry season throughout Taiwan. The estimated cost for this project is two and a half years.

According to the prices in January 1946, the above plan estimates that the restoration part will require US$4 million and NT$86.4 million; the expansion part will require US$10 million and NT$2 billion. It is hoped that the government and the people will actively invest and jointly embark on this grand undertaking.

Taiwan's location straddles both temperate and tropical zones, with a mild climate and abundant products. In addition to an annual rice production of 8 million dan (a unit of dry measure), there are also large quantities of sugarcane, camphor, tea, and mineral resources such as coal, copper, and aluminum. It also has abundant water resources, which are sufficient for the future electrification of the entire island's industry. Before the war, under Japanese rule, 400,000 to 500,000 kilowatts had been gradually developed. After being destroyed by war and typhoon damage, only 42,000 kilowatts remained when our country took over. After one year of efforts in repairs, it has reached more than 180,000 kilowatts, and it will reach 200,000 kilowatts by February next year, 300,000 kilowatts in three years, and 500,000 kilowatts in five years. If we continue with an unremitting spirit, it will not be difficult to complete the development of all 3.2 million kilowatts of hydropower in 20 to 30 years. The remaining power can even be imported into Fujian across the Taiwan Strait to compensate for the province's lack of water resources. Readers will be able to understand everything clearly if they review the attached eight tables.

### A Comparison of Old and New Life in Taiwan: Sun Moon Lake Trends Toward Industrialization, Indigenous People Live a Primitive Life

— Taiwan Air News, January 5, Tian Bian

Sun Moon Lake in Taiwan is a high-mountain lake, located in the Central Mountain Range. The lake water is the total source of hydroelectric power generation on the island, with beautiful scenery. The hydroelectric power plant there generates 143,000 kilowatts, one of the most modern industrial facilities in the world. What is surprising is that hundreds of indigenous people live on the high mountains beside the lake, still living a primitive life, untouched by the colors of industrialization. (See attached Figures 1 and 2.)

The hospitable indigenous women on the high mountains beside the lake always sing and dance when guests arrive. The illustration shows that the sound of the wood should correspond to the fall of the singing, the speed, and the rhythm, and they should follow each other. Before they sing, they stand in a circle. (See attached Figures 1 and 2.)

All industrial electricity in Taiwan Province is transmitted through the facilities of the Sun Moon Lake Power Plant. The illustration shows the transmission equipment of the power plant. (See attached picture above)

### After Obtaining a Production Loan

— Editor

Production loans can be said to be a great help for the general industrial and commercial sectors to solve their current difficulties, because general manufacturers are under the pressure of high-interest loans, and their debt figures are rising day and night, making it truly difficult and impossible to cope with. Although the amount approved by the Production Loan Review Committee may not be the same as the amount originally applied for, it will certainly provide some assistance in solving difficulties.

However, obtaining a production loan can only help with the turnover of funds, which is equivalent to adding a sum of working capital. Everything in the future still depends on one's own efforts. In my opinion, the most important of these so-called own efforts is the issue of organization. The term of a production loan is six months, so in the next six months, unless there is a precise plan, when the deadline expires, it will still be a mess and impossible to solve.

To talk about planning is to talk about organization, which is also a matter of personnel. Manufacturers applying for loans should quickly improve their own organization so that the three departments of production, sales, and economic turnover can be coordinated and carried out under a defined plan. Then, it is not difficult to achieve the goal of prosperity.

Even the smallest things should be rectified and improved. For example, the executives of general manufacturers cannot concentrate on their work, and the working hours are very short, or they concentrate all power in one person, which results in them not being able to cope with ease and, instead, delaying matters. Although this is a small problem, mistakes are often caused by small mistakes, and great difficulties are precisely the accumulation of many small difficulties.

### The Trucking Industry in America

— Chen Xiang

If the railroad is the spine of American transportation, and the airline is his nerve endings, then what maintains the blood circulation of the American nation is the trucking industry.

Trucks, like Mickey Mouse, occupy an important place in American life. Although the total volume of freight transported by all trucks accounts for only 4.6% of the total transportation volume in the United States, this percentage has its importance. Food that must be quickly transported to the market, products that are delivered directly from the factory to consumers' homes, livestock and fabrics, store deliveries and garbage, oils and mobile libraries—these and thousands of other things are transported by trucks. Two-fifths of American communities are served only by trucks.

The biggest advantages of trucks are, of course, convenience and speed. No modern means of transportation can drive directly into a warehouse like a truck, load goods, and then deliver them to stores in the city. For transporting small quantities of goods, trains are also no match for trucks in terms of time—for example, a truck can travel from New York to Richmond in just two days, but a train requires ten days.

One Car: Can Become a Transportation Unit

In addition, in the past 19 years, the U.S. government has worked hard to pave roads, so trucking has become one of America's major businesses. Twenty years ago, the United States had only 326,000 trucks, but today there are more than 4.5 million. This business can also be said to be personalized because more than half of the trucks belong to people who have only one truck and no more. However, on the other hand, many transportation companies have hundreds of trucks; "American Telephone and Telegraph Company" has as many as 22,000. Although only 15% of these 4 million trucks are leased, the total annual profit of the car owners reaches 2 billion U.S. dollars.

Although the roads in the United States are well-developed, the rules of various states for regulating trucks are different, which causes headaches for drivers and car owners, especially the different weight limits, which have a great impact on the efficiency of trucking.

Load Capacity: One to Twenty-Two Tons

Trucks are mostly sturdy and durable. Half of the trucks currently running on U.S. highways were built before 1937, and some have records of traveling more than one million miles. The styles of cars are truly magnificent; the structure of cars is also becoming more sophisticated, and the most perfect ones are equipped with cold gas, radiators, and air conditioners. The load capacity also varies greatly. In 1924, three-quarters of American trucks were one ton or lighter, but today, due to the different needs, trucking companies can allocate a small car with a load capacity of half a ton to transport packages for you, and can also dispatch a large car with a load capacity of 22.5 tons to work for mines and sawmills. Nineteen car manufacturing companies make a variety of cars for customers to choose from.

As for the drivers of American trucks, they do not view themselves as people who are engaged in hard work. Their job is to transport goods safely and on time, and they faithfully fulfill this responsibility. And they are generally excellent and physically fit drivers. According to recent statistics, there are only 2.4 accident events for every 10,000 miles of all trucks—far lower than the accident record of private cars.

Home is Everywhere: Drivers are Wanderers

The treatment of drivers is not generous. Long-distance drivers are paid two to four U.S. cents per mile; local drivers are paid by the hour or by the day. In New York, the salaries of drivers are generally higher than elsewhere. Working 44 hours a week, the income is only 46 to 64 U.S. dollars. Some lucky drivers can get food and lodging allowances.

Drivers have the same depression as other transportation workers, that is, the more the wheels turn, the farther away from home, and most of them are married. Because of this, their feelings in the industry are particularly close. Experienced drivers know where the best coffee is brewed, which restaurants cook deliciously, and which hotels are hospitable. At the doors of these places, many trucks are often parked non-stop, becoming drivers' meeting places, clubs, and lounges.

Trucking is even more important to the daily life of American cities. 34 of the largest cities use trucks to transport milk. Trucks supply 89% of the poultry to Chicago and 80% of the fruits and vegetables to Los Angeles. Without this regular service, residents of American cities would have to go hungry.

Although the current transportation volume of the American trucking industry is small, the expectations of people in the industry are very high. They hope to take on more business, increase speed, and reduce freight rates. If all these plans are really realized, trucks will become a strong enemy of trains in terms of freight.

### On Improving the Yingkou Port

— Huang Yihong

Yingkou Port was opened as a commercial port in the eighth year of the Xianfeng Emperor's reign (1858) under the Sino-British Treaty. In the second half of the 19th century, it was the largest commercial port in Northeast China. Subsequently, it gradually declined to become one of the four major commercial ports in Northeast China. The four major commercial ports were Dalian, Binjiang (Harbin), Andong (Dandong), and Yingkou. By the time of the September 18th Incident (1931), it had declined to become one of the seven major commercial ports, which included the aforementioned four ports plus Shenyang, Changchun, and Huludao. At the end of the 19th century, more than 20,000 private ships were berthed in the Liaohe River estuary. In the early years of the Republic of China, there were 3,000 ships. By the time of the September 18th Incident, there were only 1,500 ships. This alone shows a glimpse of its decline.

The reasons for Yingkou's decline can be divided into three points.

First, the Liaohe River estuary has become silted up.

Second, the rise of Dalian.

Third, the completion of the three railway trunk lines: Beining (Beijing-Shenyang), South Manchuria, and Anshan-Shenyang. Although Yingkou Port faces such a major crisis, it still has hopes for revitalization. Here, we hold three hopes:

(1) Open the Songliao Canal. The Liaohe River basin only includes a corner of South Manchuria. If the Songliao Canal is completed, navigation can be extended to the Songhua River basin and deeply into the hinterland of North Manchuria, which can absorb a large amount of materials.

(2) Dredge the Taizi River and Hun River. Both rivers are tributaries of the Liaohe River. The Fushun mining area, which accounts for more than one-third of the total national coal and oil production, is on the bank of the Hun River, and the Anshan Iron Mine and the Miao'angou Gongchangling Mining Area (with Asia's first steel plant) are on the bank of the Taizi River. Coal and iron are heavy, and transportation by shipping is convenient and economical. If these two rivers can be dredged, Yingkou can become the largest coal and iron export port in East Asia.

(3) Improve the river mouth. The waterway should be dredged to a depth of 25 feet so that large coastal vessels can enter and exit without hindrance. Also, because there are too many bends in the lower reaches of the river, silt deposition is easier. Therefore, it is necessary to straighten the bends to permanently maintain the deep-water line.

After the completion of the above plans, Yingkou can surpass Dalian and Andong. Plus,

The health of workers is directly related to production and construction. The US government and industry insiders have keenly understood the benefits of this. Therefore, they advocate research and actively protect the health of workers, sparing no effort. We only need to look at their protection of the eyes of workers to understand this.

The "Department of Social Welfare" of New York State has formulated regulations and specially set up a "Bureau for the Blind." All unfortunate incidents of blindness must be reported to the bureau, including the name, age, address, cause of blindness, and the process. The bureau is responsible for protecting the health of people's eyeballs, preventing blindness, and assisting and supervising the industrial sector to promote eye safety campaigns.

Another social organization, the "National Society for the Prevention of Blindness," has branches in various states, striving to prevent blindness and reduce disability; it regularly assists factories in checking the eyesight of workers; adopting safety goggles (for those engaged in dangerous work); configuring suitable lighting; adjusting the colors painted in factories and on machines; advising on wearing glasses (the association estimates that 40% of workers should wear glasses); and finding ways for people with poor eyesight to engage in less demanding work, so as to avoid excessive damage and blindness. Factories are also generally happy to improve and accept the association's advice. (Translated from Industrial Medicine June, 1946)

Implementation of Personnel Management

Two, Selection

In the selection process, there are several steps, which can be divided into: A. Filling out forms: Recording the details of each item to be filled out. B. Testing. C. Interviewing. D. Physical examination. Now, let's describe them separately.

A. Filling out forms: Regarding this type of form, it becomes simple or complex according to the needs of each enterprise organization. Now, we can record the items included in the employee application form of the American Edison Company.

1. Name, 2. Signature style, 3. Permanent address, 4. Can you live near the company? 5. How to relocate? 6. Mailing address, 7. Telegraph, 8. Own or rent a house? 9. Live independently or have meals provided by the landlord? 10. Information on cohabitants, 11. Place of birth, 12. Native place, 13. Native place of parents, 14. Father's address, 15. Father's occupation, 16. Married or not? 17. Number of children, 18. Who bears the family expenses? 19. Height, 20. Weight, 21. Health status, 22. Any physical defects? 23. Have you ever committed a crime? Time, place, reason, 24. Financial situation, 25. Have you ever taken out life insurance? 26. Religion, 27. Social groups you have joined, 28. How many foreign languages ​​do you know besides English? 29. What languages ​​can you write? 30. What newspapers do you usually read? 31. What magazines do you usually read? 32. What work are you doing in terms of self-cultivation? 33. Have you ever handled money matters before? 34. If you are hired, are you planning to work part-time again? 35. Have you ever had a relationship with this company before? Time and situation, 36. If you have relatives and friends working in this company, please describe in detail, name, position, address, 37. List seven relatives and friends who can be asked about everything about you by this company at any time, 38. When can you start working if hired by this company? 39. What kind of work do you like to do? 40. What kind of reward do you hope to get?

In addition to the above 40 points, there are also investigations on education and experience. Regarding education, it includes year, school, grade, major. Regarding experience, it includes year, company name, business nature, position, reason for leaving.

Because of this kind of investigation form, you can first conduct an investigation when hiring. If you think it is unsatisfactory, then you can refuse to meet them, select those who are more satisfactory, and then proceed with other matters. Sometimes, a photo of the person is required for verification.

This kind of form can be attached with an employment record at the bottom, such as: 1. Date of employment, 2. Working department, 3. Guarantor, 4. Salary. Then, after the employee is hired, the investigation form can be stored.

If you avoid posting newspaper advertisements, you can wait for the application letters to arrive and then do the first step of selection, select a considerable number of applicants, send them the above investigation form to fill out and send it out, and then set a date for testing, or notify the date in advance and bring the filled-out investigation form to the testing place on the day.

B. Testing: Regarding the conduct of the test, you can refer to the various tests mentioned in the employee psychology section, list the questions to be tested together, and then ask the applicants to answer each item one by one.

C. Interview: During the interview, you can ask various questions to supplement the deficiencies of the test. The points mentioned in the employee's heart, regarding (1) honesty, (2) loyalty, (3) cooperation with colleagues, are questions that can be asked during the meeting, and the remaining types can be tested.

The interview place must be spacious, with a spacious waiting area outside. Because even if that group of people is here to apply, they must be made absolutely comfortable in spirit. However, the person in charge of the interview must also speak kindly, and not put on a dignified face, which will cause people to feel fear and affect the answer.

Production Tidbits

### Nylon Manufacturing Method

— Shiqi

During the war, nylon was exclusively used by the military for the manufacture of parachutes. Therefore, ever since the first pair of nylon stockings appeared on the market in 1940, demand has always exceeded supply. Today, 90 percent of nylon is used to make women's stockings. DuPont plans to produce 23,000,000 pounds of nylon yarn annually, or 450,000,000 pairs of stockings.

This shiny synthetic fiber is spun from coal, air, and water. The process of making nylon is briefly introduced below:

The raw materials for nylon are coal, water, and air. Carbon is extracted from coal, hydrogen from water, and oxygen from air. These four elements form the crude nylon, called nylon salt.

The nylon salt solution is evaporated in a large vessel to completely evaporate the water. Then, the nylon enters another bucket, where the small molecules of nylon are polymerized at high temperature to form chain-shaped long molecules.

The thing obtained by this polymerization flows out of the flat hole in a molten state, like toothpaste, called Polymer ribbon. On the drum, one side of the drum is immersed in cold water. As the drum rotates, the nylon cools and hardens, and goes to the cutting table to be cut into thin slices. The resulting flakes must be put into a mixer and a warm roller to mix, so as to make the quality uniform.

After mixing, it is heated again to melt it, and the melt is extruded through small holes in a metal plate to make nylon fibers. These fibers solidify quickly in cold air, and then are spun into nylon yarn on a spinning machine.

Take a sample of nylon yarn from the yarn bobbin of the spinning machine, take a certain length of it, and put it on the balance to weigh and distinguish the thickness of the nylon yarn. Distinguish its thickness on the yarn bobbin. Put the yarn bobbin into the box and dry it in the nylon yarn twist finishing furnace. Then wind it on the spool again.

The nylon yarn is spun from one spool to another, passing through a machine, with a layer of glue on the surface of the yarn, so as to protect it when weaving silk or other fabrics. The nylon yarn of each yarn bobbin or spool is still carefully inspected to ensure that it is complete and flawless, and then it must be packed and transported to the knitting factory.

### Learn While You're Old, Do While You're Old, Youth Never Fades

— Translated by Chun from this month's Reader's Digest

Almost in any year of your life, the fear of "old age" can strike you at any time. As a psychologist specializing in the various problems of the elderly, I have found that a larger percentage of my patients are young adults in their thirties -- those young men and women who are already worried about the increase in age and are trying to learn how to deal with those increased years. I am about to say seven things that will be beneficial for anyone from the age of ten to seventy, if he is interested in maintaining his youth.

But before I tell you my prescription, I think it's best to explain the ages of life again. Age should not be calculated based on the number of your birthdays. First, physiological time is completely different from clock time. As age increases, physiological time slows down; the older you get, the slower your age increases. Physiologically speaking, the change between the ages of thirty and forty will not be more than the change between the ages of twenty-five and thirty; the change from fifty-five to seventy-five will not be more than the change from forty to fifty-five.

Another reason why it is wrong to calculate age with a calendar is that different parts of your body age at different rates. Your eyes start at the age of ten; your hearing starts at the age of nearly twenty. By the age of thirty, the strength of your muscles, the function of your reactions, and the energy of reproduction have all just passed their peak. The brain ages the slowest. On the other hand, your brain is still young, and is still growing at the age of fifty; your brain reaches its peak ten years after this age. From the age of sixty, mental abilities age very slowly, until the age of eighty.

At the age of eighty, you can maintain the same strength mentally as you did at the age of thirty -- and you should know more than you did at the age of thirty. Old people often feel pain because of the loss of their memory, but creative imagination exists forever without age. What else? Age makes our self-reflection and observation more developed. Our judgment and understanding are also improving because of this; therefore, thanks to the rich experience, we have wonderful ideas to solve all the difficulties in life. In short, the increase in age makes us gain wisdom. This is why old doctors, experienced lawyers, and experienced technicians can still often compete with those younger and stronger opponents.

Learn one thing every day

My prescription for staying young is very simple: focus all your attention on the part that is still young and still growing -- your brain. Keep your mind forever awake, and then you will live completely in youth. The present is an exciting and stimulating era. You should be interested in the world around you and learn at least one new thing every day. (Translator's note: The so-called "renew yourself daily, renew yourself every day" is also.)

The most important thing is never to "sit down and enjoy happiness." Psychologists are accustomed to seeing that at the age of thirty, people have two opposite personalities. Some men and women, while doing their jobs and taking care of their families, are still constantly developing other new interests. They study newspapers and magazines. They do creative hobbies and like to use their hands and brains.

No matter how old you are now, it is still not too late to make your life more interesting. I know a housewife who, at the age of fifty, had no experience at all, and began to turn herself into a super industrial pattern designer. I know a retired electrical engineer who has become a highly paid porcelain painter. One of my patients -- a seventy-year-old woman, whose children and grandchildren thought she was too old and incompetent to retire -- founded a cooking school specializing in teaching brides, and it was very successful.

Learn when you're old

Don't think that you are too old to go to school again. Get rid of this idea completely! I know a man who went to medical school at the age of seventy. He earned titles and honors and became a famous doctor. Another person went to law school at the age of seventy-one and is now a prominent lawyer. American history currently holds a record that has not yet been broken, that is, a ninety-one-year-old woman from California went to college to study as a freshman. I know a woman who went to learn painting at the age of seventy-seven, opened a solo exhibition at the age of eighty, and is still working hard today at the age of eighty-six.

No matter how old you are, if you want to stay young, it is very easy for people with unlimited potential. If you are happy to try, you will definitely be able to do it. Keep your mind forever awake and forever active; this is the insurance and effective elixir of life.

### The Talking Banker

— Deng Shuxun

The State of the World, the Taste of Humanity

Someone asked a profound writer, "What is the definition of a bank?" The famous writer replied: "He lends you an umbrella on a sunny day, and when it rains, he takes the umbrella back."

Adding flowers to the brocade is the duty of a banker, and adding frost to the snow is the banker's unique skill.

A young man entered a money shop to learn the trade. The shopkeeper gave him a lecture: "If you want to do money business, the first secret is to cut off six relatives. No matter who your relatives and friends are, you must lend money according to the rules. Even your father is no exception." He taught him to kowtow to the rich and roll his eyes at the poor.

If you want to find the state of the world and the taste of humanity, it is best to go to the bank for a walk. They have armed guards with live ammunition, tall iron counters, and a cold air emanating from the eyes of the bank tellers in the window holes. He thinks that the person who comes to the door is not a good person. You take a belly full of enthusiasm to exchange for his group of gloom.

Collateral, collateral, collateral!

Many people hope that bankers will be philanthropists, but this idea is completely wrong. You think their conditions are so fierce: "Collateral", "Collateral", "Collateral", their dictionary has no "goodwill". The first word is reliable and unchanging collateral, the second word is collateral that can be sold at any time, and the third word is collateral that will never cause disputes. He wants to hold the debtor in his palm, so that you can't escape, can't deny it, and finally can't lose. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce wants to ask bankers to relax the standards, simplify procedures, and change collateral, but they did not expect to have done so many years of business experience that they do not even know the banker's tastes, no wonder they are hitting rubber nails. It must be known that their minds are taught by the former teachers, and even their fathers have no status, and they still care about what kind of guild you are doing.

There was an ambitious person who had not been taught by the teacher and妄想to be a banker. One day, the position was not balanced. He called a bank and asked to postpone the yesterday's拆放款项for one day. He also didn't understand the banker's tastes. According to the usual practice, he should say that it was sunny, but he said that it rained yesterday. He didn't say: "My position is very loose, it doesn't matter whether the extension is extended or not. If your position is large, I can share a little, and there is also collateral, please tell me." Instead, he said: "I can't do it, I can't balance it, and it's no good for you if I fall." This is the sound of calling for help, and it is also telling him that if you are not careful, you will also fall into the water, which scares people so much that they have to take back the money from yesterday; because they know that it will rain, which is incomparable to a sunny day, and the umbrella should be taken back as usual. The ambitious person who had his umbrella taken back finally got rained on and fell down.

There is another bank where the business personnel are too sentimental. The original collateral was cheated away by the customer, and the loan could not be recovered. This is the loss of not cutting off six new ones, and it is considered that they are not experienced enough and need to be trained.

### Do You Want to Borrow an Umbrella?

The story of求魚on a tree is probably written for the current bankers. People say that Mr. So-and-so's abacus is very shrewd, and Mr. So-and-so's methods are very煞辣. Don't blame them, they are all bankers. If you have an umbrella, he still wants to lend it to you even when it rains. If you have neither a raincoat nor an umbrella, he will see if the sun comes out, otherwise you can't borrow an umbrella. There are many stupid people in the world, but there is no one more stupid than the stupid person who goes to ask a banker for an umbrella on a rainy day.

In order to remind smart people to be smarter, and not to become smart stupid people, the tastes of bankers are written for readers to taste.

### The "Curie Couple" in the Movie

### This is King George VI's family, taken in the Windsor Garden. The one squatting is the eldest daughter of the King, who is currently suffering from marriage problems. Is it really unfortunate to be born in the royal family? (Note that the marriage problem between the eldest daughter of the King, Elizabeth, and Prince Philip of Greece, is still under consideration by the British Cabinet.)

### Stamps

— Shixiong

American calligrapher John Billing taught his son: "My son, look at the stamps. The good thing about stamps is that they stick to everything and don't let go until they reach their destination."

### A Mistake of One Sound

— Wan Shiwan

"Sui" - Wan "Shui" (year - ten thousand taxes), Tai "Ping" - Tai "Pin" (peace - too poor), Jiu "Ji" - Jiu "Ji" (relief - save oneself), "Jie" Shou - "Jie" Shou (receive - rob), "Ji" Pu Che - "Ji" Pu Che (Jeep - strike Jeep), Gong er "Wu" Si - Gong er "Wu" Si (public and selfless - public and dance private).

### An Outdated Allegory; Churchill and the Carp

— Zong Liang

After the fall of France, in that area ruled by the enemy, people were whispering a very famous allegory:

The story is about July 1940, when Britain was fighting the enemy alone, Hitler invited Churchill to Paris for a secret meeting. When Churchill arrived by plane, he was greeted at the Villa de Fontenbleau, where Hitler and Mussolini were waiting at a tea table by the famous carp pond.

The German leader was not willing to waste time: "Churchill, this is what I want to say to you, Britain is finished. Sign this document, admit that Britain has been defeated, and then all of Europe will have peace tomorrow!"

"I'm sorry I can't sign," Churchill replied calmly: "I don't admit that we have been defeated."

"Absurd!" Hitler slammed the table and said loudly: "The facts prove it!"

Churchill drank a cup of tea, "In England," he said, "we often use gambling to solve differences of opinion. Are you willing to gamble with me? The loser should admit that he is the loser in the war."

"How to gamble?" the German leader asked suspiciously.

"Do you see those big carp in the pond? Well, let's bet that without any ordinary fishing equipment, whoever catches a carp first will be the winner of the war."

"Let's bet!" Hitler roared. He pulled out a pistol and fired wildly at the carp near him. However, the pond water deflected the bullets, and the carp continued to swim unharmed.

"You come, Musso!" Hitler roared. "People tell me you are a swimming expert -- jump in!"

The Italian president took off his clothes and jumped into the pond, but although he tried hard, the carp always slipped out of his grasp. Finally, he was exhausted and climbed ashore empty-handed.

"Churchill, it's your turn." Hitler said nervously: "Let's see what you can do!"

Churchill calmly dipped his teaspoon in the water, lifted a spoonful of water, and threw it over his shoulder. He kept taking water out of the pond like this. Hitler opened his mouth in surprise and watched and said: "What are you doing here?" He asked impatiently.

"Although it will take a long time, the pond water will eventually dry up." Churchill replied while continuing to take water out, "Victory will belong to me!" Size matters. Big and small matters in the world are excerpted here.

### Garbage and Vegetables

— Fang Wen

Because garbage trucks transported vegetables and yellow croakers, it caused a wave of criticism from the Municipal Council, causing a city-wide uproar. Calmly speaking, in this difficult life, it is inevitable to be selfish. Using garbage trucks to do some side businesses to subsidize the livelihood of the drivers cannot be equated with the general officialdom, colluding up and down, and engaging in corruption, and it is better than using public cars to send wives to mahjong games and send sons and daughters to dance halls and cinemas; however, because of focusing on making money, the garbage in the city is piled up like a mountain, and it seems that he cannot shirk his responsibility for neglecting public duties for personal gain. Moreover, the Municipal Health Bureau is in charge of the city's health, and it seems a bit "that" to use garbage trucks to transport vegetables and yellow croakers!

### Gold, Dirt, Fabrication.

— Fang

The Rebirth Island Treasure Case has been transformed from gold bars into dirt, and from dirt into fabrication. It is confusing and fascinating. Fortunately, the prosecutor went to Jiangnan three times and got clues. The truth of the case will soon be revealed, and the protagonist in the case will soon lose his qualification as a mysterious figure.

### "Waves in a Teacup"

— Fang

The Hong Kong policeman who kicked the hawker Wang Yongxiang to death was previously declared innocent by the High Court. The Hong Kong government agreed to give the family a pension of HK$10,000, which at least established a legal price for Chinese lives on Hong Kong Island. However, disputes arose over the procedures for receiving the money, and the Hong Kong government is "dragging its feet" and reconsidering, unable to pay the money to the deceased's family quickly. From "their" perspective, of course, this is just "waves in a teacup!"

(Note: A certain Englishman previously described the Hong Kong issue as "waves in a teacup.")

### Truman's Difficulties

— Jiayuan

The new U.S. Congress has officially been established. Since the new year, Truman has delivered two State of the Union addresses to the new Congress, presenting his economic report and new budget. Due to the Republican victory in the 1946 congressional elections, the U.S. Congress's Senate and House of Representatives are effectively under Republican control, while the President is a Democrat. Although the policies of the Democratic and Republican parties in the United States have recently converged, there are still many differences, especially in domestic affairs. The U.S. Congress is like the head of the household, and the President is like the general manager of the family. The opinions between the head of the household and the general manager often diverge, making things difficult. Wilson and Hoover encountered similar difficulties in the past. Truman will also face the same challenges.

### Disputes in the Security Council

— Nan

The Security Council has recently been in fierce dispute over the issues of atomic control and general disarmament, with representatives from the United States and the Soviet Union engaging in heated verbal battles at the meeting. The United States insists on prioritizing discussions on atomic control, demanding that the recommendations it has put forward be followed, that the veto power not apply in this area, and that a supervisory agency be established to effectively control the handling of atomic energy materials in all countries. Otherwise, it is unwilling to participate in disarmament discussions. The Soviet Union is using the shield of general disarmament to block it. But in fact, if Washington and Moscow are determined to solve this problem, then the responsible personnel of the two countries should grasp the crux of the problem and talk it through clearly. Otherwise, why bother going through the motions?

### Montgomery's Visit to the Soviet Union

— Nan

British Chief of Staff Marshal Montgomery's visit to the Soviet Union was also a major piece of news. It is remembered that when the Marshal visited the United States to discuss the standardization of British and American armaments and visited Canada to discuss defense work in the Arctic region, the Soviet Union felt greatly uneasy, believing that these measures were aimed at the Soviet Union. This time, Marshal Montgomery's visit to the Soviet Union was quite unexpected, and the Soviet side was also somewhat surprised when they first heard the news. In fact, the standardization of British and American armaments, the defense of the Arctic, and so on, may simply be based on wartime lessons to prevent unforeseen circumstances. Just as the Soviet Union has established a defensive ring around its periphery, there is no need for so much suspicion. Now, Marshal Montgomery is going to the Soviet Union to explain the details clearly, which can dispel some of the clouds of suspicion shrouding the world.

### Colonies

— Wang

The colonial issue is becoming increasingly intense. Indonesia, Vietnam, India... everywhere is in chaos, and no appropriate solution can be found. According to the ruling countries such as Britain, France, and the Netherlands, they seem to have no intention of oppressing the colonies, but the people of the colonies have their due freedom and rights and will never be willing to continue in this way.

Spring and Autumn

### Chunmei

— Qinlu

"Blame it all you want, but I don't have a pretty daughter-in-law to give to the bailiff. At my age, I still have to go to the county to pay taxes myself. Last time, when I walked to Songgang, I was so out of breath that I couldn't catch it. Luckily, Cao San's eldest son was kind enough to carry me over the hill. It was hard enough to find the place to pay taxes, but those people pulled long faces, as if I owed them Chen Damai, picking sand and complaining about weeds, almost making me angry to death. If I had a pretty daughter-in-law, my taxes would be waived, and who would dare to fart no?" Granny Zhao Wu, holding a bowl of sweet potato porridge, babbled on and on to Xiao Chong, a farmhand from the Cao Da's family next door. She saw Chunmei hanging clothes on the threshing floor, and she deliberately raised her voice and said:

"Her man is nowhere to be found, and she's still so interested in dressing in bright red and green. I guess she still has her eye on that old fellow."

Xiao Chong, afraid of getting into trouble, slipped away. Only then did Granny Zhao Wu stop talking, holding the porridge, and drinking it with slurping sounds.

Chunmei pretended not to hear, and hung the clothes with her head down.

"Time to eat!" her mother-in-law called. She didn't answer, picked up the wooden bucket, and walked towards the house. Granny Zhao Wu made a face at her from behind.

"I've seen all kinds of daughters-in-law in the world, but I've never seen anything like you, with that mournful face all day long. That Wang the Blind Man's fortune-telling was really accurate, saying you were born with a jinx, not wrong at all. Since Fa'gen left a few years ago, not a single word from him. Who would believe he's still alive? Look at those cheekbones like two mountains, your unlucky horoscope has harmed our Zhang family," Zhang Da said fiercely.

Chunmei silently picked up the corn porridge on the table. Suddenly, she felt nauseous, and she quickly held it back and ran into the room. Granny Zhang walked to the door to greet Bailiff Ding, who was walking along the roadside.

Bailiff Ding came in and sat down, sizing her up. Granny Zhang saw this clearly from the side and quickly smiled and said:

"Chunmei is getting prettier and prettier. She doesn't like corn porridge and is hiding in the room getting angry!"

Bailiff Ding immediately frowned and said:

"Did you use up all the money I gave you last time?" He took out a wad of banknotes and put them on the table. "Don't eat corn porridge anymore. Buy her what she likes to eat. If you run out of money, ask me again!"

Bailiff Ding slowly strolled into Chunmei's room. After a while, he came out with joy all over his face and said softly to Granny Zhang:

"You have to take good care of her and not let her do any work. You know that old freak in my family has given birth to a pile of money-losing goods. Up until now, I don't even have a son."

Granny Zhang watched Bailiff Ding walk away and then went back to her own room to get a few pairs of torn socks to give to Chunmei. "I want to wear these today. Hurry up and mend them for me," she said, and then went next door to chat.

Chunmei cleared the table, cleaned the kitchen and the hall, and then sat down to mend the socks.

She had married into the Zhang family at the age of seventeen. From the first day she was a new bride, she had never had a peaceful day. She and her husband had a good relationship, but because of this, she didn't know how much grief she had suffered from her mother-in-law. Whenever Granny Zhang started scolding, Zhang Fa'gen would find an excuse to leave, and Chunmei would hide in the room, afraid to come out. If her mother-in-law saw her with red and swollen eyes, she would say that she was used to being coquettish in front of men and instigating him to be unfilial to his old mother. Whenever she was extremely sad, Chunmei couldn't help but think of her mother. When she was very young, her mother often secretly held her hand and shed tears, complaining that God was blind and had made her meet such a mother-in-law.

In recent years, Chunmei had cautiously observed "female virtues." She endured her mother-in-law's endless insults. Since her husband went off to war, her mother-in-law's temper had grown even worse, but she still endured it, believing that serving her mother-in-law was a way of being worthy of her husband.

More than a year ago, the bailiff had asked someone to tell Granny Zhang that he wanted to marry Chunmei as his second wife. Because of this, Chunmei had cried her heart out. Her family had taken her back to live with them for a while, but she was still worried about her mother-in-law being unattended, so she insisted on returning. Finally, Chunmei was tricked by Bailiff Ding and Granny Zhang. She thought that this was fate, and except for thinking of Fa'gen and often crying, she rarely thought of anything else. She did feel a bit uneasy about Granny Zhao Wu's gossip this morning, but when she thought about being pregnant, she felt a few unnamed surprises.

"Is Chunmei home?" someone asked softly.

Chunmei looked up and suddenly blushed, running into the room. It turned out to be the bailiff's wife, known for her shrewishness. She saw Chunmei hide in the room, so she followed her in and closed the door. After a while, she came out and left. Immediately, Chunmei let out a burst of crying and moaning in the room...

"You can't find a lazy thing like this in the world. At this time, she still hasn't started a fire to cook. Does she intend to starve her old mother to death?" Granny Zhang cursed as she came in.

"I think you've put on enough of an act. Giving birth to a child is nothing strange. Do you need to make such a fuss!" She pushed open Chunmei's door and cried out in surprise, bursting into tears, ignoring Chunmei, who was unconscious, and went to Bailiff Ding's house.

Bailiff Ding came with people. They first untied Chunmei from the beam and placed her on the bed. Several people were so busy in the small room that they couldn't move.

"It's too late..." Granny Zhang thought of how good Chunmei had been to her on weekdays, and her conscience was awakened, unable to hold back her sobs.

The bailiff's wife rushed over in a few steps, threw herself on Chunmei's body, and burst into tears.

"Chunmei! I was counting on you to continue the line for our Ding family..."

Granny Zhang listlessly let go of Chunmei's cold hand, covered her face, and walked out...

### Night Reading Notes

— Li Wenxun

Reading Peng Weier's "On Poetry," he argues that writing poetry should be like doing fractions in mathematics, as clean and polished as possible. His meaning is nothing more than saying that poetry should be simple and beautiful. His tone is concise and lovely, and passionate. His poems do not emphasize antithesis, value the freedom of sentiment, and especially cherish the beauty of nature. Therefore, as soon as you open his poems, you can smell the fragrance of lilies and roses. In the quiet of the night, music floats down from the heavens. No wonder Moore says he is a singer rather than a poet...

Shelley's death often makes me close the book and sigh, lamenting why the world's geniuses are all short-lived. Although not every line of his poems is a masterpiece, phrases such as, "I never was attached to that great sect. Whose doctrine is, that each one should select, From all that he might read in their own books, Just as much faith as suited his own looks", and "music to hear, why be behest, than music Sadlyi sweets witheets uan not joy dilights.in joy."

I feel that every word is just right, and you can't add or delete a single one. If it were a Chinese poet, he would definitely talk about "wind-born phoenixes," "great shonas," and all sorts of joyous and sweet theories, tearing the beautiful artistic conception into small pieces. The reason why Moore loved Shelley so deeply was also because of his gentle, far-reaching, and metaphysical atmosphere.

### Scenery of Barbizon

— Corot

Corot (Jean Baptiste Camille Corot 1796-1875) was a pure Parisian. His early works were classical. After becoming tired of Paris, his style changed when he arrived in Barbizon, faithfully adhering to nature and creating a unique style. His later works were mostly landscapes, with elegant colors, light brushstrokes, and particularly clever composition. The entire painting reveals a quiet and elegant poetic atmosphere. He produced a wealth of work throughout his life, with over three thousand pieces existing in the United States alone. This painting is an oil painting, currently housed in the Louvre Museum in Paris, France. (Lion)

### Poems from Outside the Dream Pavilion

— Xu Chengyu

Sitting with Feibai at Baijiang Tower at Night, Immediately Presented

The traces of hegemonic strategies and royal plans have become history, and today there is no one to match your talent. Stop saying that you understand the profound principles of Samadhi, and instead seek refuge from the Ten Qin among the clouds. Bellflowers and chickens all have imperial qualities, and those wearing lotus leaves and fragrant belts are also human. Sitting in the river tower, facing the West Mountain moon, this is the eternal body of the Divine Land.

Inscribed on the Poetry Scroll of Yu Laoqi

In the Southern Kingdom, there is a poet named Yu, whose verses cherish the fragrant smoke of rivers and mountains. He carries the moon from the plum ridge and the sky, writing it into the clouds on the paper of the Songhua River. The final draft is worthy of being passed down on jade tablets, but the remaining atmosphere of the Divine Land has not yet been calmed. Do not add more sorrow and resentment to your poetic feelings, lest the remaining people cannot bear to hear it.

A hundred battles, the autumn branches have not withered, sitting in the empty hall, listening to the rain like a tide. Settling the mind and returning to peace, allowing the rivers and mountains to be lonely before the eyes. The water rises, the ducklings are delicious, and the lonely wild geese soar in the sky. Human affairs depend on the flow, only standing in front of the door are ten-foot banana trees.

An old friend's family lives in Nanchong City, where smoke and flowers cover the spring clouds above the city. The old friend's hermitage is on the west side of the city, where lectures are lively and full of wonderful things. Not only does his calligraphy and ink enter the subtle and faint, but he also directly pursues the rustic customs of Qiyuan and the Lake Li villages. He invites me to travel all over West Mountain, and I no longer see the White Deer Academy in my eyes. He still intends to cast Yao and Shun in his remaining affairs, and it is not difficult to change the customs and transform them into elegant ones. The personalities of a hundred years are not ordinary, and I am ashamed of my weak strength in the face of molding them. Next year's spring light will float on the Han River, and turning my head in the clouds, I will see West Mountain.

About to Leave West Mountain, First Have This Work

In the third month, the Jiālíng River is about to end in spring, and the one who is leaving is glorious again. Facing the window, accumulated green clouds are stacked in thousands. Behind the mountain ridge, the empty water sways in one direction. The stone steps are sparse with flowers, leaving behind the dream rain, and the old egrets on the paulownia branches send off the remaining afterglow. Next year, at this time, we will still remember each other, and the fragrant grass and clear river will resemble Hanyang.

An impromptu verse at Qingju Mountain Pass

Steep cliffs embrace the high platform halfway up the sky, the old fortress is empty and the setting sun shines brightly. How many generations have become pillars in the middle of the stream, the green mountains are safe and sound, and I have come again.

Bell argues in his "Theory of Art" that literary groups and cliques are entirely organzations to promote their ideas, that geniuses are initially attacked, and if they cannot be defeated, they are scolded for being backward and decadent, and the frame is placed on their heads. Thus, the genius painters of Barbizon had no choice but to escape Paris to the green countryside, and even the best geniuses, such as Van Gogh, could only sit in cafes, engage in idle talk, and eventually go crazy and commit suicide in the sunlight they loved. Valery's fate was not much different. There are still very few poets in the world who, like Schiller, are not afraid of soft or hard tactics. If I had Byron's talent, I would definitely challenge the "Edinburgh" gentlemen to a mortal duel, but unfortunately, I lack his talent, so I'm talking a bit presumptuously.

Gide's two turns have been noticed by the world, but few people are willing to focus on his love. Gide is a poet who, apart from life and truth, would not utter any flattery or falsehood. His philosophical distress and various worldly contradictions may not have been seen by the world. Reading his "Travels in the Congo" and "Letters from Italy," the flower-scented cities and sunny countries, and the sights and paces of Florence, are so full of charming thoughts and scenery that they seem to drip with water. How passionate Gide's hope for the future of life is! The apples are ripe, letting everyone's mouth get close to them, and everyone is invited to the feast of heaven. Gide is truly a lovable poet who is willing to use his energy to talk about life. His love and maturity deeply move people.

Reading the French poet Vigny's tragedy "Chatterton," the coldness of the world and the fickleness of human relationships are chilling. This is a real person, Thomas Chatterton, a young English poet of the nineteenth century. At the age of twenty-three, he took all his poems to the human gathering place of London, wanting to display his beautiful poems to people like a child, but he received ridicule and mockery. No one paid any attention to him. He lived alone in a rented shack, without a friend or relative, shivering in the cold winter night, hungry and cold, unable to imagine that a woman would sympathize with him, loving his youth and talent, secretly squeezing out coins and bread. This woman was his landlady, young and beautiful, and mature, with a good heart. But this kindness and beauty was obviously unable to heal the poet's severely wounded heart. One snowy night, he swallowed a large amount of arsenic and quietly escaped this vile world. This ending was tragic enough, but unexpectedly, after his death, those "most holy teachers"-like "literary mentors" greatly appreciated him, held memorial services, and published a special collection of his works... This situation is even more tragic.

American anarchist scholar Hodder wrote "Dialogue in Heaven." Although heaven is lonely, it is full of human affection, and although the human world is lively, it is full of absurdities, it is truly an indescribable sigh. After reading it, sorrow surges. However, as Tolstoy said, "The Kingdom of God" is originally in the hearts of human beings. The ebb and flow of the heart is a state of mind, just like walking around a corner, there are dung pits and gardens, it just depends on how you walk.

The meaning of life, although it is a topic of endless dispute, but looking at Nietzsche's and Tolstoy's views, it is nothing more than seeking the sublimation of life, but the paths are different, and there is only one direction. Humans are born unwilling to settle down, and life is truly like a foolish farce, perhaps without any joys, sorrows, loves, or hates. Tolstoy said that all learning is meaningless if reasoning does not match the purpose. His theoretical basis lies in a group and its interests—morality. Nietzsche's so-called "Created for me, given without pity," is outside the group. If the center of the world is still in humanity, then Tolstoy's view is naturally correct, but if we focus on the completeness of heavenly principles, then the truth seems to belong to Nietzsche. Both started from the "heart," but the results unexpectedly ran in opposite directions, and in the end, they could not avoid returning to the same destination through different paths. Tolstoy's painstaking efforts are moving, and Nietzsche's hard work is admirable, but after rereading "弗浴伊特叙傳", his heart for learning and winning is even better than Nietzsche's. Not only are thinkers like this, but so are good poets. Gide, in "New Nourishment," discusses that the highest goal of life should be to value desire, value the present, value the future, value liberation, and value creation. His unrestrained passion is truly like Nietzsche... From this perspective, we must be enriched, we must do things, we must suffer, we must strengthen ourselves to fight, and our articles must be solid.

Reading Pater's "Marius the Epicurean," I gained many insights about the true meaning and price of thought. Marius began as an apostle of Epicurus and ended as a Christian martyr. Everywhere are traces of the heart, traces of blood. The chapter "The Golden Book" elaborates on Apuleius's myth of Cupid and Psyche, with human feelings and beauty. The chapter "The Dialogue" is full of wisdom about the debate between philosophy and truth, and the thoughts are so fragrant that they are intoxicating, more than being drunk on wine. From this, I deeply feel that the bookworms in the world are really much happier than kings and nobles.

### An Inch of Mountain, an Inch of Blood 146

— Ye Jingfeng

In ancient Chinese weapons, the sword is a sacred object that ordinary martial arts practitioners cannot afford. But clearly it is a parade saber, why do the Japanese insist that it is a sword? What is the reason? The "judo" they call large is merely a remnant of Chinese martial arts. But the blind people of the world all say that this is Eastern boxing, encompassing everything, and they also praise the Japanese martial arts as being powerful. This small matter of nomenclature is enough to make people angry.

Martial arts, or boxing, is not easy to talk about. The so-called Japanese boxing is merely a kind of Chinese grappling, or wrestling, which, although it is a kind of boxing, cannot be used to encompass all martial arts. Furthermore, looking at the current "swordplay" of the Japanese, the first thing, "grabbing with both hands," is at least one hundred and eight thousand miles away from swordplay. Those four techniques of chopping, splitting, cutting, and slashing are clearly the preliminary methods that parade saber users, and everyone must know how to use them, as the "lifesaving moves" for lower-ranking soldiers to fight in close combat. To insist that this little bit of thing is kendo is enough to make insiders laugh their jaws off. The advanced parade saber has 108 steps and 36 techniques; the steps are divided into virtual and real, the hands have yin and yang, and the steps and hands correspond everywhere, which is the format of the parade saber. These four lifesaving moves currently practiced in Japan are not even up to the level of superior parade saber techniques, so how can they be worthy of being called kendo?

However, the Japanese "kendo" also has a history of several hundred thousand years. Is it possible that there is not a single shred of "reason" in the way they practice it? That's not entirely true either. As the saying goes, "If you put in enough effort, an iron pestle can be ground into a needle." The only thing to fear in any skill is not being willing to put in the effort. If you are willing to put in the effort, even if you don't have a legitimate master, you can still grind out some principles over time.

Therefore, since Japanese kendo has been divided into six levels and nine paths, it is said that no one has ever reached the sixth level or the ninth path. The saying of six levels stopped circulating before the Meiji Restoration, and only nine paths remained. Only a very few of their ancient and modern kendo masters have practiced to the eighth path; the so-called eighth path is actually the end of the seventh path. The Japanese are naturally prone to exaggeration. Once they reach the end of the seventh path, since no one dares to compete with them, and there is no proof after death, they can only be allowed to talk nonsense.

So what is so powerful about the end of the seventh path, or the so-called eighth path? It turns out that when kendo is practiced to this path, all ordinary techniques are abandoned, or rather, all are melted into a technique that does not speak of techniques. This technique is called "using the heart to wield the sword," which is similar to the Chinese Taijiquan method of "using the heart to guide the intention, using the intention to direct the qi, and using the qi to operate the five senses and hundreds of bones." What is the benefit of using the heart to wield the sword? It is the same as the Taijiquan method: "When the opponent does not move, I do not move; when the opponent wants to move, I move first." In other words, it is to use one's own intention to restrain the enemy's intention, and to wield the sword with one's spirit, so that the sword and the spirit are perfectly united. Therefore, it is said that Japanese "kendo" has indeed developed some not-so-small principles.
