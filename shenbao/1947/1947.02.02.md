[Central News Agency, Jinan, 1st] The Communist Field Army in Shandong, in order to coordinate the renewed invasion of northern Jiangsu by the New Fourth Army in southern Shandong, has recently concentrated forces between Pingdu and Landi in eastern Shandong, with the intention of invading southern Shandong. Their Seventh and Eleventh Divisions are concentrated around Yucheng in northern Shandong, having captured Weiji and wreaked havoc on Yancheng. Their Fourth and Ninth Divisions, a few days ago, secretly fled south from Boshan, passing through Mengyin, and advancing rapidly towards Linyi, seemingly to reinforce Chen Yi's old base and prevent an attack by Hao Pengju's forces.

[United Press, Nanjing, 1st] Dalian Mayor Gong Xuesui recently released a statement to the press stating: "I recently sent representatives to secretly enter Dalian to investigate the actual situation.

In the Soviet military zone of Lushun, there are approximately 100,000 Soviet troops and 500 Soviet aircraft, but there are no Soviet troops within Dalian City. Chinese and Soviet representatives recently held talks in Pulandian, but were unable to take over due to obstruction by the Communist army. I have had multiple talks with Soviet Ambassador Petrov. The ambassador asked me when I would go to take over, and said that I could take either the land route or the water route, but if the government sends only a few officials, it will not be easy to take over. If troops are sent, there will be a conflict with the Communist army."

### Communist Personnel of the Military Mediation Department Can All Be Evacuated Within a Week

The Communist side has not yet announced its completion time today, but it is expected that this evacuation will be completed in less than a week.

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 1st] After the news of the U.S. personnel's withdrawal from the Military Mediation Department spread, the atmosphere in the Changchun branch was calm as usual.

U.S. staff from each team in the Changchun branch will gradually concentrate in Changchun in the coming days. Government representative Major General Deng Weiren and U.S. representative Colonel Tyson remained silent. When Communist representative Li Chuli spoke to reporters, he only expressed regret for the government personnel who had died in the mediation work in the past. According to a spokesman for the government, the Changchun branch needs at least one month to complete its work.

### Wu Tiecheng Returns to Nanjing, Expresses Deep Regret Over the CCP's Rejection of Peace

[Central News Agency, This City News] Secretary-General Wu Tiecheng took leave to come to Shanghai due to health reasons and will return to Nanjing today to cancel his leave. A reporter from the Central News Agency made a special visit to his residence on Haige Road and was granted an audience. Wu looked calm and slightly refreshed. After shaking hands and exchanging New Year's greetings, he said, "I have not had a day of rest in fifteen years. I took this opportunity to come to Shanghai to examine my health and rest, and I am very pleased with myself." The reporter then presented some recent events and asked for his opinion. When the domestic political situation was mentioned, Wu only said, "The CCP's rejection of peace talks is not only a personal regret for me, but it must also be deeply disappointed both domestically and internationally. The United States' announcement of abandoning mediation efforts is a natural consequence and should not be regarded as unexpected." When discussing the constitution and constitutional government, Wu said, "Now that the constitution has been promulgated, constitutional government will soon be implemented. I hope that all people in the country will work together with one heart to complete the implementation of the constitution as scheduled. The government bears the heavy responsibility for all legislative procedures and will gradually handle matters. However, the general society's enthusiasm for constitutional government is still insufficient. I have analyzed it and found many reasons, some at the top and some at the bottom. There is one point that has become a habit, unnoticed, but is actually very important. That is, some officials, even police and baojia, forget their identity as public servants of the people, serving the people, and act as rulers, treating the people as the ruled class. This indirectly creates a dislike of government offices among the people, so that all government orders, once issued from government offices, are met with indifference by the people, let alone working together to seek practical results. We must remedy this unhealthy state, eradicate this wrong concept, and then constitutional democracy will naturally have a new atmosphere. President Chiang has repeatedly exhorted officials to persuade and care for the people, abide by the law, and be responsible. He also asked officials to fulfill their responsibilities as nannies. This is the attitude that politicians should recognize and practice." When discussing the plane crash issue, Wu said, "In the past month, more than 100 people have been sacrificed, and several old friends have died. This is a great misfortune for the aviation industry, but the rescue work after the accident has to be criticized for being too inefficient. Because of the slow and negligent rescue by the airline and the relevant rescue agencies, minor injuries turn into serious injuries, and serious injuries are not rescued quickly and lead to death. For example, my younger brother was only discovered on the second day of the accident. His young life was not lost due to the lack of timely rescue, which is truly a blessing from the gods. I can only thank heaven." As for the stripping and searching of clothing from the distressed passengers in their groans or after their deaths, he said, "I cannot help but be saddened by the morals of the world." Finally, when discussing the difficulty of eradicating the customs of the Lunar New Year, Secretary-General Wu slightly relieved his worries and said, "The New Year has arrived again. In the traditional Chinese emotion, I feel that the plan for the year lies in the spring. The New Year always brings youth, brings endless hope, and brings new life. This emotion has also become a powerful encouragement for the society every year during the Spring Festival. As long as the people of the country are good at accepting this encouragement, while taking into account the difficulties of the country and the heavy responsibility of national construction, this generation must warn each other not to be selfish and self-serving, and the next generation must encourage each other to be diligent and hardworking, to be productive and proactive, and to lay a solid foundation for the country and the nation, and work together for thirty years, so that the third generation will have the good fruit of prosperity, strength, and happiness."

### The Chairman Hosts All Legislators for a Banquet, With Many Encouragements for the Work of the Legislative Yuan

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 1st] Chairman Chiang hosted all legislators for a tea party at the Lizhi Society at 5:00 PM on the 1st. More than 50 people attended, including Sun Ke. First, legislator Li Qingmo asked the Chairman to deliver a speech. The Chairman stood up and spoke, saying that during the eight years of the War of Resistance, the colleagues of the Legislative Yuan worked hard. During his time in Chongqing, he had no time to meet with everyone often, so he took this opportunity to express his condolences. Furthermore, the work of the Legislative Yuan this year will be busier than in previous years because all the laws for implementing the constitution must be completed this year, so he hopes that all colleagues will work hard to achieve this goal. Refreshments were then served and the event ended at around 6:00 PM.

### The Constitutional Government Promotion Association Can Be Established Within the Month

### The Democratic League Hosts People From All Walks of Life, Hoping People From All Walks of Life Will Participate as Members

[Our Newspaper News] At 2:00 PM on the 1st, the Democratic League hosted people from the city's industrial, commercial, and cultural circles at the YMCA. Chairman Zhang Lan attended, with over 200 people. In his report, Zhang Dongsun emphasized the independence and intermediary nature of the Democratic League and hoped that people from all walks of life would participate to realize a "true and broad" democracy. After the meeting, a reporter interviewed a key member of the Democratic League and asked about the expansion of the organization and the work policy. According to him, most of the members of the Democratic League two years ago were from the education and cultural circles, but now many government officials and people from the industrial and commercial circles have joined. In the future, the absorption of members will extend to all walks of life, but the Democratic League does not have an army, so very few soldiers join the league. As for the work policy in the future, in addition to strengthening the internal forces, they will not give up the opportunity for mediation at any time. However, in view of the repeated failures in the past, resulting in a loss of credibility, they will not act rashly unless they are confident.

### The Chairman Hosts Government Officials for a Banquet to Exchange Views on the Current Situation, The Social Democratic Party Has Not Yet Proposed a Plan to Reorganize the Government

During the banquet, they extensively exchanged views on the reorganization of the government and various regulations in the process of implementing the constitution, such as various election laws. The reorganization of the government is currently underway actively. Wu Tiecheng, Lei Zhen, and others are still in Shanghai, working on this matter. The conversation ended at around 9:00 PM.

[Our Newspaper News] The Social Democratic Party has not yet proposed a specific plan for the reorganization of the government. No meeting was held on the 1st, but opinions were exchanged privately. According to a key member, if a meeting is not held next Monday, this matter will be brought up for discussion at the regular meeting on Wednesday. The problem now is not the principle but the details. The Social Democratic Party ultimately hopes to play a significant role after joining the government, rather than just taking office. It is expected that this matter will not be delayed for too long. The rumor that it must be postponed until after the foreign ministers' meeting is completely inaccurate.

### Last Year's Christmas Day Plane Crash: Full Text of the Political Council's Investigation Report; Analysis of Responsibility Issues and Suggestions for Improvement

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 1st] The Standing Committee of the Political Council previously dispatched Jiang Yong, Zheng Kuiyi, and Yin Shuxian to Shanghai to investigate the truth of the Shanghai plane crash on December 25th of last year. They arrived in Shanghai on January 8th and completed their investigation. The results were submitted in a written report to the 14th meeting of the council on the 31st. It was resolved to submit it to the government for consideration and action. The plane crash attracted national attention, and the investigation by the Political Council was highly regarded by all parties. The full text of the report first details the investigation process in Shanghai from January 8th to 15th, followed by three items: (1) The Truth of the Accident, (2) Responsibility Issues, and (3) Improvement Suggestions. The full text of the report concerning these three items is recorded as follows:

The Truth of the Accident

(1) Aircraft No. 140 was a C-47 type, coming from Chongqing, stopping in Hankou, and then taking off again, flying to Shanghai via Nanjing. Aircraft No. 115 was a C-46 type, coming from Chongqing, stopping in Hankou, and then taking off directly to Shanghai. Aircraft No. 48 was a C-1 type, taking off from Chongqing at 8:40 AM on the 25th, arriving in Hankou at 12:15 PM, continuing its flight from Hankou at 1:10 PM, and arriving in Nanjing at 3:00 PM, continuing its flight to Shanghai at 3:25 PM. (2) After each aircraft took off, according to the China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) weather forecast, Shanghai and Nanjing had similar conditions, i.e., from 11:00 AM to 5:00 PM, the cloud ceiling was 2,000 to 1,000 feet, or descending to 500 feet, and visibility was one mile to half a mile. Normally, take-offs and landings require a cloud ceiling of 300 feet and visibility of one mile. Beyond these limits, the airfield would be closed. On that day, Aircraft No. 140 arrived in Nanjing at 4:38 PM, Aircraft No. 115 arrived in Nanjing at 4:02 PM, and Aircraft No. 48 arrived in Nanjing at 3:20 PM. Except for Aircraft No. 48, which experienced normal weather passing through Nanjing, Aircraft No. 115 experienced changing weather in Nanjing and was on a direct flight to Shanghai, so it was permissible to fly to Shanghai. However, when Aircraft No. 140 arrived in Nanjing, the weather had deteriorated, and it attempted to land unsuccessfully, so it continued its direct flight to Shanghai. Aircraft No. 140 arrived in Shanghai airspace at 6:40 PM, Aircraft No. 115 arrived in Shanghai at 5:10 PM, and Aircraft No. 48 arrived in Shanghai airspace at 5:40 PM. The weather had already deteriorated. The Shanghai airfield had been closed at 4:30 PM. When Aircraft No. 140 arrived in Nanjing, it telegraphed the Shanghai company at 4:00 PM to inquire whether it could fly to Shanghai for landing. It received a reply at 4:17 PM that it was not advisable to fly to Shanghai after dark. At 5:10 PM, it was instructed to fly at an altitude of 7,500 meters. Aircraft No. 115, apart from contacting Longhua by telegram at 3:35 PM, had no further telegram communications. Aircraft No. 48, due to normal weather, followed the usual procedure and flew to Shanghai. (3) According to Wu Ci, head of the flight crew of China National Aviation Corporation, Aircraft Nos. 115 and 140 were both permitted by the Jiangwan Control Tower to land at Longhua. Except that Aircraft No. 140 had insufficient fuel and spent three-quarters of an hour flying over Longhua Airport, it crash-landed blindly at 7:54 PM outside the runway fork of Longhua Airport. Aircraft No. 115 circled over Shanghai for about four hours before crash-landing blindly at 9:29 PM, one mile south of Longhua Airport. Aircraft No. 48 was permitted by the Jiangwan Control Tower to use radar for landing and crashed at 8:10 PM outside the Jiangwan Airport, one mile from the Zhang family's house. (4) Aircraft No. 140 carried a total of 27 passengers and three crew members. After the crash, 22 passengers and three crew members died. The remaining five passengers are still recovering in Zhongshan Hospital. Aircraft No. 115 carried a total of 38 passengers and three crew members. After the crash, 32 passengers and two crew members died. One person was uninjured, and seven are still in Zhongshan Hospital. Aircraft No. 48 carried a total of seven passengers and four crew members, totaling eleven people. All passengers and crew survived.

Responsibility Issues

Upon investigation, Director Li of the Ministry of Transportation promised to send the entire investigation of the plane crash for reference. Furthermore, Dai Anguo, Director of the Civil Aviation Administration of the Ministry of Transportation, also promised to send another copy of the investigation report for reference. However, more than ten days have passed and it has not yet been sent, the inside story of which is incomprehensible. Regarding the responsibility aspect, based on what our colleagues personally investigated, we provide four points for discussion:

Since the establishment of civil aviation companies in our country, people from all walks of life have expressed their concerns. Summarizing the main points, it is nothing more than flight crews smuggling and engaging in corruption, neglecting their duties, and being arrogant, leading to frequent occurrences of fuel theft, overloading, poor communication, and improper management. Looking at the responses of the two companies to this incident and the investigation, the China Central Air Transport Corporation's (CCATC) responsibility seems lighter, while the China National Aviation Corporation's responsibility seems heavier. CCATC's Aircraft No. 48 crashed at Jiangwan. If there is responsibility, apart from the pilot himself, it should be attributed to the personnel of Jiangwan Airport, which is controlled by the U.S. military. Moreover, that company seems to pay closer attention to both major and minor issues. For example, when the weather in Shanghai suddenly changed, it ordered Aircraft Nos. 46 and 43 to stop flying to Shanghai at 4:10 PM. Regarding the problem of negligence of underground personnel in Qingdao mentioned by Representative Li Dongyuan, it investigated and reported the matter within three days. Conversely, China National Aviation Corporation did not order its aircraft to stop flying after 4:00 PM that afternoon. Although its report mentioned a telegram from the Longhua radio station indicating a possible flight suspension, the fact that it could not provide a definitive instruction is a fact. Furthermore, regarding the negligence of underground personnel in Qingdao mentioned by Representative Li Dongyuan, it has remained unanswered to this day. In addition, when our colleagues inquired about the deceased, the words of the general manager and others were evasive, which proves that the personnel of China National Aviation Corporation are usually not cautious in their self-cultivation and are not thorough in their work. Therefore, in this accident, the authorities of China National Aviation Corporation cannot escape criticism. This is the first point.

Weather forecasting is the most important guide for flight personnel. However, the weather forecasts from the meteorological stations that day, from 11:00 AM to 5:00 PM, were all above the limits for flight take-offs and landings. However, after 4:00 PM, not only did the weather in Shanghai deteriorate, but the weather in Nanjing also changed suddenly. Therefore, in this accident, the meteorological personnel should bear part of the responsibility. Otherwise, if the meteorological equipment is inadequate and the meteorological observers are insufficient, the Ministry of Transportation and China National Aviation Corporation should not shirk their responsibility. This is the second point.

Whether the airfield equipment is complete or not directly affects the safety of flight landings. Longhua Airport is uneven and filled with puddles. The company authorities did not cover it with sand and soil in peacetime, but after the accident, they attributed it to financial difficulties. The fact that Aircraft No. 140 crashed at the fork and perished may have been caused by the uneven airfield, which is possible. As for the surrounding buildings being obstacles, it is not the real cause of this accident. This is the third point.

Both companies have been able to handle the aftermath of this incident thoughtfully. However, the compensation for company personnel is better than that for passengers, which should be improved. The deaths of company personnel are indeed regrettable, but they cannot be said to be without responsibility. Conversely, the deaths of passengers are clearly without any responsibility. If the compensation is significantly different, it does not seem very reasonable. Moreover, to increase the company's caution, it is better to increase the compensation for passengers and provide equal treatment. This is the fourth point.

Improvement Suggestions

(1) Aviation regulations should be formulated promptly to unify the command of flight navigation and strengthen the management of flight crews. (2) Military airfields should allow civilian aircraft to land during peacetime. (3) More weather observation instruments should be added, and the number of weather stations and observers should be increased. (4) Airfields should be modified, and attention should be paid to adding and lengthening runways. (5) China Central Air Transport Corporation and China National Aviation Corporation should cooperate thoroughly and assist each other to develop the civil aviation industry. (6) The performance of aircraft should be inspected more thoroughly. Aircraft that have exceeded their service life should not be used again. (7) Seasonal climate is unpredictable. Before accurate forecasting technology has reached its best, all flights should be suspended when the weather is unfavorable. (8) Ways should be found to transport the remains of the deceased passengers for burial in their hometowns. (9) China National Aviation Corporation should be thoroughly rectified, and the personnel responsible for each accident should be severely punished. (10) All civilian aircraft, regardless of nationality, flying in our country's airspace should be subject to the jurisdiction of the Civil Aviation Administration. (11) The compensation for aircraft accidents should be revised. Equal regulations should be made for the compensation for all flight crew members and passengers.

### This Year's Steel Production: Sun Yueqi Estimates 230,000 Tons; The National Resources Commission Will Plan Sales

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 1st] Sun Yueqi stated: Under this year's steel production plan, in addition to their own use, the steel plants and mines in Northeast and North China can supply 230,000 tons of finished steel products, including 60,000 tons of iron. According to customs import statistics from before the war in 1934, 1935 and 1936, the annual amount was 600,000 tons. Currently, domestic transportation has not recovered, and some factories have not yet started production. It is estimated that an annual demand of 300,000 tons will be sufficient to meet needs, which is already [not quite legible]. In terms of steel prices, although foreign steel is cheaper, the price per ton, including transportation costs, has reached around 3 million yuan, while domestic steel costs about 800,000 yuan per ton, so there should be no problem with the market. Currently, the steel industry in the Northeast is still the mainstay, accounting for three-quarters of the total. Recently, the President of the Executive Yuan allocated 20 billion yuan to support production at the Anshan Iron and Steel Works. North China accounts for one-quarter of the national total, with Shijingshan being the main producer. Because it is currently using good iron ore from Pangjiabao and coal from Jingxing, [production in] Pingjin has not yet been able to develop greatly. In Central China, the government will use Japanese reparations in the form of industrial equipment to re-establish the Daye Iron Mine, which may be completed within five years. Regarding the dismantling of Japanese steel equipment, Nanjing should make a decision soon. Sun also mentioned that he will soon go to the Northeast again, and to Datong to inspect the situation.

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 1st] Sun Yueqi, Deputy Chairman of the National Resources Commission, said: In order to encourage industrial development and save foreign exchange, the Executive Yuan has established an Import Management Committee. The National Resources Commission has also formulated a comprehensive plan for this year's steel production in the Northeast and North China and submitted it to the Executive Yuan for approval. The steel production conference held in Peiping lasted a week and concluded successfully on the 30th. Detailed discussions were held on the equipment of each factory, the current production level, the types, quantities, market conditions, business organization, sales prices, and the transportation of raw materials and finished products. This year's production volume, excluding the factory's own use, can supply about 230,000 tons of finished steel products. The North China Steel Company's three plants in Shijingshan, Tangshan, and Tianjin have already started production, except for the Tangshan and Tianjin plants. Regarding the Yihua iron ore and coking coal required by the Shijingshan Huai Iron Plant, an agreement has been reached with the Pingjin Railway Bureau, and transportation will begin in March and April. Therefore, the Shijingshan Iron Smelting Plant will also be able to start production by July at the latest. In the Northeast, the Anshan Iron and Steel Works has partially resumed operations for the steel rolling section at the end of last year, supplying some steel products. It is now actively being repaired and will soon be fully operational. The steelmaking sector is scheduled to resume operations in April and May. The blast furnaces were severely damaged by the Communist forces and will not be repaired until August of this year, when production can begin. The special steel produced in Benxi and Fushun is of excellent quality and has already resumed production. This year's products can supply the entire country with surplus. The National Resources Commission also plans to establish a business organization in Shanghai to coordinate sales and make legal regulations on prices. At a time when steel prices in Shanghai are chaotic, if the commission's products can be transported in a stable flow, it can have a stabilizing effect. However, the success or failure of this steel production plan in North China and the Northeast is closely related to whether railway transportation can cooperate. Especially in the Northeast, where there is a shortage of vehicles, and the amount of raw materials and finished products to be transported is large, the problem is even more serious. At this steel conference, the issue of vehicle replenishment was also discussed in detail. The Shenyang Locomotive and Rolling Stock Manufacturing Plant of the National Resources Commission has decided to manufacture 800 new vehicles this year in order to increase railway transportation capacity. However, all the required steel materials must be specially supplied by the Anshan Iron and Steel Works. In addition, some vehicle parts must be manufactured by the Shenyang Machinery Plant of the National Resources Commission.

### Japanese Robbed Our Copper Coins and Nickel Coins; Discovered in Nagasaki and Other Places; The Ministry of Foreign Affairs Prepares to Negotiate for Return

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 1st] The Ministry of Foreign Affairs recently received a telegram from our representative delegation in Japan stating: A large number of our country's copper coins and nickel coins have been discovered stockpiled in Nagasaki, Osaka, and other places in Japan. There is no doubt that these were looted and confiscated from our people by the Japanese army during its occupation of our country. After receiving the report, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has sent official letters to various provinces and cities, requesting them to quickly investigate the quantity and evidence of losses suffered by the people of each province and city during the Japanese occupation, so that after collection, it can send a letter to the Executive Yuan's Committee on Reparations from Japan to negotiate with Japan for their return.

### First Batch of Japanese Reparations: We Demand Half the Allocation

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 1st] Industrial circles report: The US government has authorized MacArthur to handle 20% of Japanese industrial equipment reparations first (the total is between 7 million and 12 million tons), and a decision should be made soon. It is not yet known whether our country's request to allocate 50% of the first batch of industrial equipment will be successful. It is reported that the five-member committee representing our country in handling industrial equipment reparations has been appointed. If China's request is successful, it will obtain 600,000 tons of industrial equipment. How to transport and reconfigure these machines is a difficult and arduous task. This year's transportation will be tasked with dismantling and transporting [the equipment] to Japanese ports for boarding, but we will be responsible for it after it is loaded. It is estimated that transportation costs alone will require 2 trillion legal tender and 39 million US dollars. At the same time, our ports do not have cranes capable of unloading 140-ton loads, which must be urgently equipped. If domestic transportation and deployment work are added, it may take several years to complete.

### The Vietnam War is Tense: The Yunnan-Vietnam Railway's Repair is Slowed Down

[Our Newspaper, Kunming, 1st] The Yunnan-Vietnam Railway Engineering Committee recently received an order from the Ministry of Transportation stating that due to the tense situation in Vietnam, the repair of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway will be temporarily postponed, and the engineering budget for this year will no longer be included. Construction will resume when the situation improves. The Committee stated that the current repair of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway has reached 80% of the entire route, and the road surface of the two sections from Hekou to Yifan Village and from Bisezhai to Xianguo Village has been paved, and it only needs to lay the steel rails to be open to traffic. It is now stepping up its work to improve the road that has been completed. In the future, when the situation changes, a new plan will be formulated. At the same time, the Committee, due to insufficient personnel, also intends to implement a three-point plan: (1) Vacant positions will no longer be filled, (2) Expenses will be reduced, (3) Waste will be utilized as much as possible.

### Dim Lights in the Dacheng Hall: Debate Concludes in the Ding Mocun Case; The Capital High Court Scheduled to Announce Verdict on the Afternoon of the 8th

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 1st] The traitor Ding Mocun case has concluded its debate after nine and a half hours of day and night long-term trial by the Capital High Court. The verdict is scheduled to be announced at 3:00 PM on the 8th. According to court president Jin Shiding's announcement in court, the court will reopen the debate if it deems it necessary.

The Fourth Criminal Court of the Capital High Court interrogated the traitor Ding on the 1st, with court president Jin Shiding serving as the presiding judge, and judges Ge Zhaomou and Shentu Chen as associate judges. Prosecutor Chen Lizu also appeared in court in the afternoon. The traitor Ding was wearing a blue tight robe and carrying a large leather bag full of files. His face looked more haggard than before. After going to court, he often held his chest with his hand and coughed occasionally. He once used his weakness and illness as an excuse, claiming that he was weak and had no strength to speak, and requested a postponement of the trial. However, when it came to self-praise, he stood in front of a kerosene lamp and spoke eloquently for as long as two hours. The Dacheng Hall was dark all around, and the lights were dim. All 500-600 people in the audience held their breath and listened to his self-praise and self-admiration, making people recall the scene of the Beijing opera night trial of Pan Hong, which made their hair stand on end.

The most noteworthy aspects of today's trial were the two cases of Ding's murder of Yu Hua, the former president of the Shanghai Special District High Court, and Zheng Pingru, an underground worker of the Military Intelligence Bureau. Mrs. Yu Hua also appeared in court to testify, stating that Yu Hua was shot on the morning of November 23rd of the 28th year of the Republic of China at 9:00 AM. When his coachman chased after the car, he saw the murderer escape in car number "7841." That car was found again in front of the 76th Division at 3:00 or 4:00 PM that afternoon, and Ding was the head of that intelligence agency, so Ding should bear full responsibility. Mrs. Yu Hua also pointed out that after the case occurred, Zheng Pingru sarcastically asked Ding, when he was very happy, why he killed this honest official. Ding replied that he had previously sent someone to order him to join the "He Yun," but Yu did not know the situation, so he killed a chicken to scare the monkeys, and warned Zheng Ruwei (Zheng Tiejiang, head of the Criminal Court of the Suzhou District Court) that he should also know the situation and join, and should know that the "72 Calling Number" was not without people.

Ding made sophistry about the Yu case, first claiming: He was forced to join the 76th Division, without courage or power, all the power was in the hands of Wu Shibaobao and others, and he himself was also under control, let alone killing people. He pointed out that at that time, Wang Jingwei had not yet formed a government, and there seemed to be no need to kill a judge. At the same time, there were at least four enemy intelligence agencies in Shanghai at that time, not necessarily referring to the 76th Division. Finally, he pointed out that the car number pointed out by Mrs. Yu differed before and after. Since Mrs. Yu pointed out that Wang Shaofu was the owner, the court should investigate this active evidence.

Regarding the tragic murder of Zheng Pingru by the traitor Ding, the court presented the written statements of Pan Sansheng and Zheng Pingru, etc., interrogated by the Shanghai court. The court clearly stated that the traitor Ding was responsible, and read the letter sent home by Zheng when she was in the 76th Division as evidence. After receiving the letter, Ding repeatedly looked at the envelope, paying particular attention to the stamp and the seal. Finally, he carefully looked at the pseudonym and the date. His expression while looking at the letter made it clear at a glance that he was a veteran special agent. The traitor Ding and his defense lawyer's response to the case was that the letter had no year or sending address, and it could not be proven that it was written by Zheng. Ding also falsely accused Zheng's birth mother of being Japanese, grew up in Japan, and had a relationship with the Japanese intelligence agency before joining the underground work, and also had a connection with the Japanese Communist Party. The killer was Japanese, and there were many involved in the deportation. As for the poisoning of the hands because his request was not fulfilled, he flatly denied it.

When Ding was tried today, he repeatedly stated about his service in Zhejiang, claiming that this move saved the lives of at least 10 million people. He was quite boastful and frequently said that this was not "self-praise," but only "explaining his heart." And imitating Zhou Fohai's tone, he said: "Everything that I, Ding Mocun, did can be said to be colluding with our country and resisting Japan." He looked at the audience hopefully, hoping that "the court and society can uphold justice."

Prosecutor Chen Shengchi sternly rebuked Ding's various fallacies, believing that for the sake of national law and justice, this kind of fickle villain should be severely sanctioned. As for Ding's claim that he saved the lives of 10 million people in Zhejiang, he also believed that "small merits are not enough to cover up great faults," because Ding's various actions hindered the War of Resistance and harmed 450 million compatriots. The cases of Ding's murder of Yu Hua, etc., all happened during Ding's tenure as the head of the 76th Division, and Ding cannot shirk his responsibility.

Today's criminal court started at 10:00 AM and adjourned for a lunch break. The hearing was reopened and ended at 9:30 PM.

### Main Culprit in Guangdong Landing Craft Smuggling Case: We Request Extradition from Hong Kong; Other 18 Criminals to Be Transported to Nanjing

### Opening of the Jiangxi Administrative Conference

Nanchang Designated as a Prostitution Ban Demonstration Zone

[Our Nanchang Dispatch, 1st] The Jiangxi Administrative Conference held its opening ceremony on the 1st morning. Wang Lingji delivered the opening address, stating that the biggest shortcomings preventing Jiangxi's administration from achieving expected results were: (1) lack of talent, (2) financial difficulties, leading to low competence and efficiency of staff. The administration should address current malpractices, review them, and discuss improvement points. He hoped that: (1) personnel should be employed according to their abilities, (2) financial resources should be handled properly to meet the minimum living needs of public educators and staff, and (3) county finances should not only consider personnel living expenses but also emphasize the actual funding of undertakings to promote county administration. Starting in the afternoon of the 1st, various agencies will submit reports, and proposals will be discussed from the 8th, with the closing ceremony on the afternoon of the 12th.

[Central News Agency, Nanchang Dispatch, 1st] The issue of banning prostitution has been widely discussed here.

### Beijing Opera Circle in Beiping Commemorates Li Shifang

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 1st] The Beiping opera circle held a memorial service at Zhongshan Park on the morning of the 1st for Li Shifang, one of the "Four Little Famous Dan" who died in a plane crash. His teacher, Shang Xiaoyun, presided over the ceremony. More than 200 people from the opera circle attended. Li's parents, wife, and daughter mourned deeply. Shang Xiaoyun expressed regret for the demise of this successor to the Mei school, saying that the "Four Little Famous Dan" now lack their leader and no one can replace Li Shifang. Li's father stated that Mei Lanfang may perform an unpaid benefit performance for him in Shanghai in March, but Beiping has not yet indicated anything. When asked about his opinion on Mei and Cheng performing together in Shanghai, Shang said that Cheng had acknowledged Mei as his teacher in the seventh year of the Republic, so it does not contravene the ethics of mentorship, but it's okay if it is considered a business transaction. Furthermore, Beiping's entertainment tax has been reduced from 60% to 25%, which is celebrated by the opera world. However, the situation where more than half of the tickets are patronized by military and police despite suppressive measures remains a major pain point for the Beiping opera circle.

### Editorial: Political and Labor Unrest in Japan

After the Yoshida Cabinet in Japan submitted its resignation on the 28th of last month amidst nationwide calls for its downfall, it was ordered by the Emperor to form a new cabinet. Although Prime Minister Yoshida intended to unite the three major parties – the Social Democratic Party, the Liberal Party, and the Progressive Party – to form a unified democratic government for Japan, the Social Democratic Party's firm refusal to participate in the new cabinet forced him to abandon his attempts to bring them on board and instead form a coalition cabinet of the Liberal and Progressive parties. Although the new cabinet was established yesterday and its list of members has been submitted to the Emperor for approval, the political unrest in Japan is still raging. Not only are the general public continuing their campaign to overthrow the cabinet, but also members of parliament have expressed deep dissatisfaction with Prime Minister Yoshida's method of selecting cabinet members, deeming it inconsistent with democratic principles.

Many difficult problems still lie ahead for the new Yoshida Cabinet, something that Prime Minister Yoshida himself is well aware of. After the "National Assembly to Overthrow the Cabinet" was held by national people's groups on December 17th of last year, Yoshida himself understood the difficulties of Japanese politics, especially the current economic crisis. Simply reforming the cabinet by including some members of the Progressive and Liberal parties would be like changing the soup without changing the ingredients, and would not break through Japan's current economic predicament. It would require the participation of the Social Democratic Party, which is backed by the working class, to bring a fresh perspective and weather the current crisis. Therefore, after his cabinet submitted its resignation, he consulted with the leaders of the Social Democratic and Progressive parties to form a unified coalition government. The Social Democratic Party consistently insisted on its three demands: (1) to replace Finance Minister Ishibashi to thoroughly change his fiscal policy; (2) to require the People's Cooperative Party to participate in the new cabinet at the same time; and (3) to add Suzuki and Kato, two members of the Social Democratic Party's left wing, to the party's list, while reducing one or two right-wing members from the list. These three demands were not acceptable to Yoshida, so the plan for a coalition government had to be abandoned, and another way out had to be sought.

Looking at the composition of the new Yoshida Cabinet, the Liberal Party's position in the cabinet has become even stronger than before. Most of the added non-partisan members are also conservatives. Whether this kind of cabinet is welcomed by the majority of the Japanese people at present is, of course, a very serious question, especially the reappointment of Finance Minister Ishibashi, which is most unpopular with the general public. The Social Democratic Party's refusal to participate in the cabinet has gained even more support from the working class, making workers even more eager to participate in the movement to overthrow the cabinet. Therefore, more than three million Japanese workers plan to take advantage of the breakdown of the final negotiations between the Japanese government and representatives of the public servants' association to implement the largest strike in world history on February 1st. If the Japanese government and the Allied control authorities do not find a way to prevent this unprecedented strike wave in advance, the harm it will cause will be worse than a volcanic eruption or other types of disasters. Therefore, the Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces, who is responsible for controlling Japan, had to take high-pressure measures and order Japanese workers not to strike.

We have read MacArthur's statement on this matter: "The reason I have taken this measure is to prevent fatal damage to the public welfare. Japanese society is already under Allied control due to its defeat in the war. Its cities are desolate, its industries are at a standstill, and most of its people are hovering on the brink of starvation. A strike will disrupt transportation and communication; it will prevent the movement of coal, inevitably causing industry to come to a complete standstill. This will plunge the Japanese people into disaster." From this, we can also get a glimpse of the actual situation in Japan today. In the past, labor unrest in Japan was instigated by the Japanese Communist Party, but the Yoshida Cabinet often turned a deaf ear to the demands of the working class, without any consideration, and instead frequently adopted high-handed policies. The greater the pressure, the greater the backlash. Therefore, the Yoshida Cabinet cannot escape considerable responsibility for the spread and expansion of labor unrest in Japan. As things stand now, labor unrest in Japan is becoming increasingly difficult to control, and MacArthur is still taking high-handed policies and prohibiting Japanese workers from striking. Japanese labor unions have no choice but to abide by MacArthur's orders and reconsider their decision to strike. If Japanese workers insist on their own views and must carry out the strike, the consequences are truly unimaginable, and Japan will fall into an even more chaotic state.

Recalling when the Allied forces began controlling Japan after Japan surrendered? They clearly announced that the goal of controlling Japan was to put Japanese politics on the path to democracy, and to make it one of the peace-loving countries in the international community, no longer threatening the peace of the Far East. From then until today, nearly a year and a half has passed. Looking at MacArthur's achievements in controlling Japan, and thinking about whether Japanese politics has embarked on the path to democratization? We really dare not be overly optimistic about the future of Japanese politics. At present, Japan must obey MacArthur's orders in everything, so the change of cabinets is either Yoshida of the Liberal Party or Shidehara of the Progressive Party. The constant changes ultimately fail to satisfy the Japanese people, forcing them to stand up and hold anti-cabinet movements, shouting slogans to overthrow the cabinet. MacArthur disregards Japanese public opinion and insists on adopting high-handed policies, attempting to ensure that political power in Japan is forever held in the hands of conservatives. Is this policy consistent with his control objectives? MacArthur really needs to reconsider.

In short, today's Japan, whether politically, economically, or socially, has shown signs of turmoil. The political and labor unrest that is currently erupting seems unlikely to be resolved by the likes of Yoshida and Shidehara.

### Taihu Bandit Suppression Headquarters Abolished; Command Post Established to Transfer Jurisdiction

[Our Suzhou Dispatch, 1st] The Wuxi Command Post of the Capital Garrison Command believes that the remaining bandits in Taihu Lake have not yet been eliminated, and the bandit suppression in the border areas of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui is also expanding. It is inevitable that fleeing bandits will flow into the lake. Although the Taihu Bandit Suppression Headquarters is responsible for preventing this, it is feared that the organizational structure is divided and the command system belongs to different entities, making it difficult to achieve the expected results. A command was issued on the 1st to abolish the Taihu Bandit Suppression Command Headquarters and establish a Suzhou Command Post instead, which is under the command of the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Border Bandit Suppression Command. The location remains in Mudu, and Colonel Liu Hongde is appointed as the director of the post to continue suppressing lake bandits and divide responsibilities as follows: The lakeside areas of Yixing, Changxing, and Wujiang counties are the responsibility of the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Border Command.

### Communist Troops Destroy the Bo-Shang Highway; People of Bo County Suffer Greatly; Pledge to Support the National Army to Maintain Transportation

[Our Taixian Dispatch] The Tai-Shang Highway is an important route for the transportation of industrial and commercial goods and mail to and from Hao County. It is also the lifeline of the county and is closely related to the lives of the people. Since the Lunar New Year, large numbers of communist troops have occupied the middle section of the highway, from Zhangji to Songyanji, and Shenliuhang. They have spared no effort to destroy bridges, loot roads, shoot businessmen, or obstruct the passage of mail. The brutal behavior of the communists is extremely rampant. The merchants and people of this county have suffered greatly, and the national postal service has also been destroyed. This is intolerable by national law. At a time when the county is surrounded by communist troops and as dangerous as eggs piled up, the trampling of this highway has put our people on the road to death. Therefore, all the people of the county are filled with anger and indignation, vowing to support the national army to maintain the lifeline of transportation and protect the safety of commerce and mail.

Later, it was suspended due to the war. Now that the Anti-Japanese War has been won, all kinds of factories must be restored, and the demand for electricity is very high. The power plant plans to build a power plant, but the location in Wangting is still inconvenient. It is best to be close to the Yangtze River area, which is more convenient for transporting fuel.

### The Relocation of the Infectious Disease Hospital is Too Remote

We are workers at the Municipal Second Infectious Disease Hospital. Recently, our hospital is being moved from Haiyan to Baziqiao, as reported in the newspapers. This matter concerns the interests of every citizen in the city. We have always admired your newspaper as the voice of the people. Now, we would like to say a few words from the perspective of the citizens, and raise three points, hoping to have them published:

(1) The hospital is too remote. Most infectious diseases are acute. If a person living in the [blank] district contracts an acute infectious disease and has to hire a car to be taken to Baziqiao, it will take two or three hours on the way. The condition may worsen and lives may be lost.

(2) The transportation is inconvenient. An infectious disease hospital should be located in a place with convenient transportation for the temporary purchase of medicines and equipment. Baziqiao is located in a remote area and lacks public transportation. People may hesitate to accompany patients or because of the inconvenience of going back and forth. Just look at the First Infectious Disease Hospital, because it is located on the Tiantong Road, which is less convenient than Haiyan Road, the number of patients is far less than the Second Infectious Disease Hospital. This proves that convenient transportation is also very important.

(3) The hospital is too small. Patient isolation is a very important task of an infectious disease hospital, which can only be done with spacious hospital buildings. Currently, our hospital averages around 80 or 90 patients every day. Especially during the cholera epidemic last year, the number of patients increased to more than 200 and the corridors were filled with patients until there was no room left. Shanghai, a huge city, only has two municipal infectious disease hospitals, which should be expanded urgently. Now, moving it to the small Baziqiao hospital building is going against the needs of reality.

The above three points are entirely for the benefit of the public. We hope that social elites will provide support. (Medical Staff of Municipal Second Infectious Disease Hospital)

### How to Place Art Teachers and Junior High School Students?

The Municipal Art Normal School has been resolved by the City Council to be merged. According to reports, the normal school students will be merged into the Xinlu Normal School. However, there are 300 students in the junior high school department, accounting for six-sevenths of the total number of students in the school. How will they be placed? There is no mention in the reports, and there is no news from the school either. The schools are about to open and classes are about to start. We believe that the authorities will definitely not allow our 300 students to drop out of school halfway, and will properly arrange for them. We ask all councilors to understand that the families of the students who applied for the junior high school department of the school mostly live nearby and their economic resources are limited. We earnestly hope that a municipal ordinary boys' middle school will be established at the original site of the Art Normal School so that we will not drop out of school and have the opportunity to enter the senior high school department. At the same time, we ask the City Council and the Education Bureau to announce the arrangements for the more than 300 students as soon as possible to comfort the students and parents' hopes and benefit the citizens not a little!

### Tensions Rise in Palestine: British Government Orders Swift Evacuation of Women and Children, Launching a Precursor to an Anti-Jewish Terror Campaign

[United Press International, Jerusalem, 31st] The British government in Palestine today took drastic measures to ensure safety, ordering the evacuation of all British women and children back to their home country and relocating all government personnel to secure locations. According to a proclamation by the Palestinian government, this order is based on the recently promulgated emergency defense regulations, which empower the British Commissioner for Palestine to evacuate unnecessary non-Palestinian residents to facilitate public safety or maintain order. The term "non-Palestinian residents" likely refers to the Commissioner, who, if he decides to proceed, will also order the evacuation of Americans and other foreign residents in Palestine.

[Reuters, Jerusalem, 31st] The execution of Jewish man Groener, sentenced to death for attacking a police station, has been postponed again for 48 hours. Groener has stated that he refuses to appeal to any British court. The recent tensions in Palestine are due to the Irgun party's retaliation for his death sentence.

[Reuters, London, 31st] All British women, children, and non-essential civilians in Palestine have been ordered to prepare to leave Palestine within ten days. London believes that this measure is a precursor to an unprecedented anti-terrorism campaign to be launched by British authorities in the region. The debate over the volatile situation in Palestine in the British House of Commons began hours after High Commissioner for Palestine, Sir Cunningham, issued this order.

### British Merchants in Palestine Protest Evacuation Order

[Our Dispatch] A London broadcast on the 1st stated that the evacuation of British women and children from Palestine has commenced and will be completed within 48 hours.

[Reuters, Jerusalem, 31st] After Cunningham ordered the preparation for the evacuation of British women and children from Palestine, the British Chamber of Commerce in Palestine sent telegrams of protest to its own government and Conservative Party leader Winston Churchill, arguing that this was tantamount to succumbing to the intimidation of terrorists. They pointed out that many Britons have been operating in Palestine for many years, and therefore, their decision to stay or leave should be a matter of free choice.

### Heated Debate in the British House of Commons: Churchill Roars Again, Argues that Britain and the U.S. Should Co-manage Palestine, Accuses the Government of Steering Towards Shame

[United Press International, London, 31st] The House of Commons today held a heated debate on the Palestine issue. Opposition leader Winston Churchill expressed regret over the base war and terrorism in Palestine, demanding that the British government immediately resolve the issue of the Holy Land, or, unless the United States is willing to share equally with Britain its bloodshed, disturbances, and all tasks, the mandate of Palestine should be transferred to a United Nations organization. Britain has broken its past assurances and, having failed to implement its policies, has no right to remain in Palestine. While the British House of Commons was debating, a formal proclamation was issued in Jerusalem, ordering the complete evacuation of British women and children from Palestine. According to government officials, the order to evacuate women and children should not be taken as a comprehensive war against terrorism; this measure is largely a precautionary one. Colonial Secretary Jones stated that the government is indeed seeking a final solution.

Conservative Party member and former Colonial Secretary Stanley stated that if peace cannot be maintained, the Holy Land will become a land of bloodshed. Churchill accused the Labour government of being too weak in dealing with terrorism, stressing that in times of conflict, there cannot be a lack of fighting spirit, and praised the recent revocation of the sentences imposed on terrorists as a path to defeat and shame. Churchill acknowledged that if Britain were to withdraw, civil war would easily break out in Palestine, but the British army's presence in Palestine in the current situation cannot be justified by this matter and the strategic position of Palestine. Britain should remain in the Suez Canal area and no longer pay attention to the strategic position of Palestine, and he has never thought that Britain has a strategic relationship with Palestine.

### Indian Muslim League Rejects British Plan

### One Hundred Muslims Arrested

[Our Dispatch] A London broadcast on the 1st reported that British police and soldiers continued to arrest one hundred Muslims in Ali Akbar today, including twelve women.

### Burmese Dissatisfied with British-Burmese Agreement

[Reuters, Rangoon, 31st] Neutral observers here believe that Aung San, chairman of the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League, will encounter the most severe political test after returning to Burma from Britain on Sunday, because most Burmese people oppose the British-Burmese Agreement. Therefore, the success or failure of the Burmese Constituent Assembly depends on Aung San's response to the people's actions. Most people feel that the British-Burmese Agreement was signed under unfair conditions, and only a small number of people lacking extreme ideas believe that independence can be obtained as a result.

### McKell Appointed Governor-General of Australia

Originally a Boilermaker

### General Strike in Japan Canceled: Overthrow of the Cabinet Continues: MacArthur's Ban Takes Effect

[Kaizo Publishing, Tokyo, 1st] The general strike scheduled to be launched by 8.6 million Japanese people today was aborted due to MacArthur's intervention. Japan was calm today, but this is the calm before another storm. Trade unions across the country have temporarily adopted a strategy of decentralization to continue the struggle. The National Public Servants Joint Struggle Committee, the highest command organization for the "2.1" strike, composed of 12 trade unions, including the National Railway Workers' Union, the Urban Federation, teachers of large, medium, and small schools, postal and telecommunications workers, and administrative staff, and the National Trade Union Joint Struggle Committee, composed of trade unions from the Labor General League and industry-specific unions, announced their dissolution last night.

The National Railway Workers' Union issued a statement today stating: "We, the people of the occupied country, cannot but obey MacArthur's order, but we must overthrow the Yoshida Cabinet."

### General Strike Fails: Individual Strikes Will Be Launched

No Resentment Expressed by the Labor Community

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 1st] Last night, Tokyo Radio reported to 8.6 million workers in a sad tone that MacArthur had banned the general strike, and canceled this largest-scale general strike at the last moment. The person who broadcast this news was Ino Toshiro, chairman of the Joint Struggle Committee. After telling the workers not to strike anymore, he couldn't stop crying. His broadcast was very short, but he said he didn't understand why MacArthur wanted to ban this general strike. Everything here this morning was as usual, and government officials went to work on time. The Japanese labor community did not express any resentment towards MacArthur's order to cancel the strike, but labor community members believe that MacArthur's order only prohibits general strikes and does not prohibit individual strikes. Various public utility trade unions have been preparing to launch individual strikes. The Japanese Transport Workers' Union announced this morning that its 130,000 freight workers will launch an individual strike this afternoon, and other trade unions are expected to follow suit.

### Yoshida Cabinet: Difficult Future

[Kaizo Publishing, Tokyo, 1st] Both the Liberal and Progressive government parties expressed dissatisfaction after the reorganization of the Yoshida Cabinet. The Liberal Party is dissatisfied with the inclusion of Hokkaido Governor Masuda in the cabinet, believing that these "bureaucrats" or "quasi-bureaucrats" should not be used. Masuda was appreciated by the authorities for resolving the Hokkaido coal mine strike. The Liberal Party is also concerned about Yoshida's future use of Ho Tai as Minister of Agriculture and Director-General of the Economic Stabilization Board. The Progressive Party expressed even greater dissatisfaction with this reorganization. The party's members of parliament decided yesterday to question Yoshida on whether he intended to form a coalition cabinet for the third time, and also believed that the selection of candidates for this reorganization did not conform to the spirit of constitutionalism. This reorganization did not have any symbolism sufficient to indicate that the Liberal and Progressive parties were closely cooperating to overcome difficulties. The party expressed the most anger at Yoshida's awarding of several cabinet seats to the Liberal Party and not selecting Progressive Party members to enter the cabinet, openly expressing Yoshida's contempt for the Progressive Party. Therefore, observers believe that the Yoshida Cabinet will become more difficult in the future. Although Yoshida's vacancy of several cabinet seats can be explained as waiting for the Socialist Party to enter the cabinet, it is not a slight to the Progressive Party. However, in view of the failure of the two attempts to bring in the Socialist Party, another attempt to decide on joint work is also likely to fail. The Japanese political situation may enter the biggest turmoil since the war.

### Soviet Focus Shifts to Domestic Affairs

—Translated by Our Newspaper's Research Department

We only need to look at the enormous impact of the past ten years' several Five-Year Plans on the Soviet Union's industry, economy, and the people's lives to understand why the Soviet Union is now turning its attention back to domestic affairs. Since the establishment of the Soviet state, a quarter of its time has been spent in two major wars, and what is now needed is stability and development. Every Soviet citizen living west of the Volga River can personally witness the desolation left behind by the Germans, and everything needs to be rebuilt. To the east is the new Ural industrial zone, which has been painstakingly developed since 1941. Many industrial experts believe that this area will become the place where the Soviet Union's future life is entrusted.

Two goals have always been in the hearts of the Soviet people. First, is the hope for increased production of daily consumer goods. This depends entirely on the success of the Five-Year Plan. Second, is the hope for national security. In his speech last February, Stalin assured the people that the success of successive Five-Year Plans would enable the Soviet Union's national strength to reach such a level that it would no longer need to fear any external threats.

Therefore, the new Five-Year Plan simultaneously answers two questions: When will there be more goods? And when will there be true security?

Because of this aspiration, the Soviet people are willing to endure all sacrifices and hardships today for a better future. In the Soviet Union, a common saying is: After the completion of the Five-Year Plan, we will be able to do this and that. On the large farms of Ukraine, farmers are talking about the day when they will have more cattle and sheep, more tools, and better houses. Of course, everything is difficult at the moment. However, when the Soviet people accepted the decree extending the food rationing period, they were thinking that once this Five-Year Plan is successful, all these shortcomings will disappear.

Last October, during the celebration of the 29th anniversary of the Great Revolution in Red Square, the many flags waving in the wind showed this fervor for domestic production. The flags were embroidered with the highest records of ship, shoe, and book production. The headlines in the newspapers are also frequently about the huge numbers of factory production.

Every Soviet citizen knows that they will benefit from this expansion of industrial production in the future. At present, the Soviet people can get very little, but they understand that the harder they work and the harder their companions work, the more likely they will have a better life in the future.

There is also a great driving force behind this effort, and that is the patriotism that was born during the war. During this difficult war, the Soviet people saw their country becoming stronger and stronger. Therefore, psychologically, they have established an inseparable connection between their own destiny and history and that of their country.

The average Soviet citizen hears Stalin say that the only way to obtain "security" is through the large-scale expansion of industrial production. Therefore, the Soviet people are focusing on domestic affairs, not only because they can get more consumer goods, but also because they can get their own security. For half a century, the Russian people have suffered more foreign aggression than any Western country, and the painful experience of this war against Germany has taught them a lesson: seeking "security" has become their most pressing hope.

The goal is still external, but in order to achieve this goal, the Soviet government and people realize that the most important thing now is to strengthen national power, mainly to catch up with Britain and the United States in industrial production. Because of this, the entire Soviet Union is currently focused on domestic industrial production, and is temporarily unwilling to be too prominent in diplomatic negotiations.

### Black Market Price of White Rice Soars; Mayor Expresses No Worry; Two Million Bags of Tribute Rice Can Last Until August; Unlimited Supply at Wholesale Price Unchanged; But Most Shanghai Residents Do Not Pay Attention to Nutrition

[Our Dispatch] In response to the recent soaring black market price of white rice, Mayor Wu specifically summoned reporters at 5:00 PM yesterday to issue a statement, saying: Although the black market price of white rice has risen to 90,000, the price of medium-quality rice (Saigon rice and domestic indica rice) has not changed. The government continues to sell Saigon rice, maintaining the original wholesale price of 63,000 per shi (unit of dry measure), and a retail price of 70,000, and the supply is unlimited. The food situation this year is not as serious as last year because the government has provided local governments with a large amount of rice. The city currently has two million bags of medium-quality rice. Based on the city's current monthly consumption of 300,000 dan (unit of dry measure), even if the source of supply is cut off in the future, it is sufficient to maintain the city's food supply until August. Therefore, citizens do not need to panic. Furthermore, white rice is only one type of rice. It is produced in the Suzhou-Wuxi area. According to rice merchants, the current price increase is due to the price in the production area having risen to over 70,000 per shi. The medium-quality rice currently distributed by the government is more nutritious than white rice, but wealthy people in Shanghai generally prefer to eat white rice, which is less nutritious but more expensive. In the past, the government had no rice, but now there is a sufficient supply of rice, but it is all medium-quality rice. Therefore, if you want the price of white rice to fall, on the one hand, we hope that citizens will eat less white rice and use medium-quality rice as a substitute. By doing so, we will not create a black market price for white rice, and it is believed that the price of white rice can fall within two weeks. Mayor Wu continued to say that the distribution of flour will definitely not be interrupted and that the ration will remain the same.

Rice Dealers Pay Homage to the Mayor, Requesting Rationing of Real White Rice Collected as Tax

[Another Dispatch] The Rice Dealers' Association, considering that Saigon rice is less popular and that citizens usually prefer to eat white rice, decided at a meeting a few days ago to petition the authorities that in addition to selling Saigon rice, they also hope to be able to ration a portion of the white rice collected as tax in kind, in order to suppress market prices. Yesterday morning, they sent Qu Zhenhua, Zhang Xichao, Yang Runyu, and Su Boxun as representatives to pay homage to Mayor Wu to convey this intention. Mayor Wu was out on official business, so the four representatives paid homage again at 2:30 PM in the afternoon, at which time Ji Mingqi, the chief of the Food Section of the Bureau of Social Affairs, was also present. Mayor Wu then stated: If other prices all rise while the authorities only suppress the price of rice, then rice merchants and farmers will suffer losses. However, based on the ratio of the past year, the recent increase in rice prices is clearly excessive. The city government will increase investigations and prohibitions. At the same time, it is hoped that all rice dealers will not buy black market white rice that exceeds the limit price, and customers are advised to purchase and eat Saigon rice. Then the trend of rising white rice prices can be suppressed.

Insufficient Inventory Creates Black Market

According to rice merchants, the recent rise in the black market price of white rice is due to insufficient inventory and a scarce source of supply. Due to the influence of high-interest loans, before the end of the lunar year, Shanghai merchants only had about 50,000 zuo (unit of dry measure) of white rice in stock, and farmers usually do not officially start shipping out until after the fifteenth day of the first lunar month. Therefore, the current retail price of white rice after careful deliberation is 76,000 per shi, while the black market price has risen to 90,000.

### Price Fluctuations; Chairman Concerned

According to Commander Xuan Tiewu yesterday, when he was summoned to Nanjing to pay homage to Chairman Chiang, the Chairman was most concerned about the price fluctuations in Shanghai during the Lunar New Year. He said that if various prices rise without restriction, it will have a great impact on people's livelihoods, and appropriate measures should be taken to prevent this. At the same time, the Chairman also expressed concern about the treatment of police in Shanghai. The work of the police in Shanghai is particularly heavy compared to other places. They should be given security in their lives so that they can work with peace of mind.

### The Teacher Management District Has No Place to Work; Work Can Only Begin After Waiting

### Ships Depart Early; Passengers Make Futile Trips

[Our Dispatch] When a ship carries passengers, the Maritime Administration Bureau stipulates the size of the ship, the number of passenger seats, and the condition of the equipment. If there is excessive loading, it will be subject to considerable punishment once it is found out. However, at the end of the Lunar New Year, many people working in Shanghai returned to their hometowns to spend the New Year, resulting in trains, highway buses, and ships being more crowded than usual, and it was impossible to restrict this. As a result, the Zhijiang ship, which runs on the port route, was overloaded and collided with the Huatong tugboat at Wusongkou, resulting in a tragic accident. After this case occurred, the Maritime Administration Bureau paid special attention, and dispatched personnel to the dock to monitor the departure of the ships sailing to Tongyang, Chongming, and Qidong. It is now known that the number of passengers going to Beisha has gradually increased again. Therefore, the Jiangkang ship, operated by Datong United Company on the Shanghai-Tong line, departed early on both of the past two days because there were too many passengers. Therefore, when the number of passengers boarding the ship was close to the limit set by the Maritime Administration Bureau, it set sail immediately. The ships were originally scheduled to depart at 10:00 PM every night, but on the past two nights, they departed at around 8:00 PM, causing some passengers who had already purchased tickets to not only miss the ship, but also waste money on transportation back and forth. They also suffered other unexpected losses. Therefore, the passengers all advocate that the ship should still depart on time. If you want to avoid excessive passengers, it is better to limit the sale of tickets.

### Water Supply Difficulties in Western Shanghai; Emergency Measures to Dig Artesian Wells; Needs 9.4 Billion, Awaiting Approval by the Municipal Council

[Our Dispatch] Water supply is difficult in Western Shanghai, and local residents feel inconvenienced. In the blink of an eye, summer is coming, and water is needed. If it is not improved, there will be many difficulties. The Bureau of Public Utilities is currently trying to find a solution.

According to the discussion, the Yangshupu British Waterworks Company only supplies the former Public Concession area. West of Jing'an Temple, the roads were built across the border, and the master control belonged to our municipal government. However, the British Waterworks Company laid water pipes in the area long ago, creating a fait accompli. However, because the water pipes were narrow, the water supply was not smooth. After the victory, the Bureau of Public Utilities was eager to solve this serious problem. The contract between the British Waterworks Company and our government is about to expire, and the Bureau of Public Utilities' research on the company's supply volume has also reached a saturation point and cannot be increased. Moreover, from Yangshupu to Western Shanghai, laying water pipes has a diameter of up to nine kilometers, which is too far.

Construction of the Longhua Water Plant Cannot Be Realized at Present

After research, it is planned to build a water plant in the Southern Huangpu area to supply the needs of Western Shanghai. However, its location cannot be too south, as the water pipes would be too long. After surveying and discussing, it is believed that the current Longhua Airport area is the most suitable. However, because the water plant is located next to the airport, it poses many obstacles to the take-off and landing of airplanes, so it is still a problem. In addition, funds and materials are also two major difficulties. Under the current high-interest loan situation, the profits of public utilities are meager, and it is not easy to encourage people to invest enthusiastically. In addition to the material problem, the United States is currently facing a situation where countries around the world are placing orders after the war, and supply cannot meet demand. Therefore, this plan cannot be realized in three to five years.

Short-Term Difficulties in Solving Water Transportation in Nanshi

Under these circumstances, the Nanshi Inland Waterworks has a surplus of water supply because some factories in Nanshi were destroyed during the war and have not been restored, and there are fewer users. At the intersection of Jilu and Xietu Road, there is a water pipe that can lead to Western Shanghai to transport water. It is four kilometers long. However, this 20-inch diameter water pipe cannot be found in Shanghai at present, and even if the water pipes can be connected, Western Shanghai will need to build reservoirs, pumps, and other equipment. Therefore, this method cannot be easily solved in the short term. The current emergency measures are only to rush to dig artesian wells. Although there are many difficulties in geology and water volume, it is still a stopgap measure. The Bureau of Public Utilities prepared a detailed plan in December of last year. The total cost, including water supply from Nanshi and digging artesian wells in Western Shanghai, totals 9.4 billion. It was sent to the Municipal Council to be added to this year's budget. The Public Utilities Committee decided in principle to pass it during the review. However, because the Municipal Council's discussion of the Municipal Government's entire budget has not yet reached a conclusion, it is still unknown whether this plan can be fully approved. The Bureau of Public Utilities has already started preparations, and once the Municipal Council approves the plan in March and the Municipal Government allocates the funds, it can be coordinated and rushed. In this way, the water supply problem in Western Shanghai may be improved before this summer.

### All Passenger Planes Thoroughly Inspected; Both Companies' Freight Transportation As Usual

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 1st] After the Ministry of Communications ordered the temporary suspension of passenger transportation by China National Aviation Corporation and Central Air Transport Corporation, in order to prevent further unfortunate incidents from occurring, it ordered both companies to thoroughly inspect all passenger planes, with a deadline of one week. Both companies have already started inspections, which are expected to take two weeks to complete. At the same time, the airport equipment and meteorological reports will be improved separately. It is heard that the resumption of flights will be no earlier than mid-February.

[Our Dispatch] After the Ministry of Communications expressly ordered the temporary suspension of air passenger transportation, both companies' freight transportation is still flying as usual, but the schedule is irregular.

### Establishment of the Photography Reporters' Association; Directors and Supervisors Sworn In

[Our Dispatch] The Shanghai Photography Reporters Association held its inaugural meeting at the New Life Club at 2:00 PM yesterday. Thirty-four members attended.

Each member will submit five works, and experts will be invited to evaluate them before holding an exhibition for all sectors to visit and criticize in order to develop news photography techniques.

### New Telephone Directory Printed; Uses Up to 200 Tons of Paper; 120,000 Copies to Be Distributed Starting Next Week

[Our Dispatch] According to the Shanghai Telephone Company, the long-awaited 1947 Chinese and English edition telephone directory will be printed in the coming days and will be distributed to users starting next week. This is the first new telephone directory to be issued since 1941. Compiling this new telephone directory took more than two months and mobilized approximately 200 people.

The 1947 telephone directory is the largest in terms of length since the Shanghai Telephone Company began issuing telephone directories. The Chinese version has a total of 850 pages per copy, and the English version has a total of 550 pages per copy, an increase of 280 pages compared to the pre-war edition, that is, an increase of 24 percent.

A total of 121,000 copies of the new Chinese and English telephone directories have been printed, including 100,000 copies of the Chinese version and 21,000 copies of the English version, an increase of 17,000 copies compared to the 1941 edition.

These 121,000 copies of the new telephone directory total 96 million pages. If each page is connected end to end and laid flat, the total length would be 15,500 miles, which is equal to three-fifths of the circumference of the earth around the equator.

The 1947 telephone directory used a total of more than 200 tons of paper. At a time when paper is scarce around the world, it is no easy task to complete this work.

A total of 13 tons of metal were used for the printing plates. The font used for the English version is called "Bell Gothic," which was designed and made by the American Telephone and Telegraph Company specifically for printing telephone directories. The font used for the Chinese version was also specially made by the Shanghai Telephone Company itself.

The new telephone directory combines and publishes the users of the Shanghai Telephone Company and the Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau of the Ministry of Communications, listing up to 200,000 account names. In addition to making it quick and easy for users to check, the compilation method also focuses on various conveniences. The most notable is the parallel publication of new and old place names, so that the difficulties caused by road names can be resolved.

In addition to individually publishing ordinary business and residential users, it is also classified and arranged according to the nature of the business, organization, group, and occupation, totaling 1,000 types. There are also 3,000 advertisements. Therefore, the telephone directory can also be used as a directory for all sectors in the city.

### Insured Parcels Within the Country Can Now Be Resumed for Acceptance and Mailing

### Wang Zijian Passed Away and Will Be Cremated According to His Instructions

Wang Zijian, a famous Chinese legal scholar, practiced law after leaving politics. During the War of Resistance, he stopped his business and stayed at home. He then suffered a stroke. After several years of bed rest, he passed away on January 31st. His will states that no obituaries should be issued, no condolences should be accepted, and he should be cremated immediately. His family has decided to follow his will and keep everything simple. The coffin will be placed in the China Funeral Home at 2:00 PM on the afternoon of the 4th of this month, and he will be cremated on the same day. Wang was known for his integrity and was impoverished after his death. Close relatives and friends believe that wreaths and tin foil are a waste of money, and they plan to give condolences instead to help with the funeral expenses, which is more practical.

### A Piece of Copper, a Handful of Ashes: Don't Relax if You Want the Truth - Excavating the Fire Site: City Government Sends Laborers, Wang Family Sends Supervisors. Gu Xun and Zhu Changhe Regain Freedom Yesterday.

[Our Reporter] After the fire on Seymour Road, discussions arose from all quarters, especially regarding the allegations of firefighters looting during the fire, which spread far and wide. Although the five-person investigation committee has been working hard for days and has made some progress, five firefighters suspected of dereliction of duty have also been detained. However, the gold bars, jewelry, and other items lost from Wang Yunfu's home remain missing as of this moment. The investigation committee suggested to the Wang family that they carefully excavate the remaining ashes of the fire site, as the truth might be revealed from the debris. However, the Wang family objected, as they had already been excavating continuously for three days and three nights after the fire without any results. However, in order to thoroughly clarify the truth of the case, the investigation committee has, as of yesterday, sent laborers from the city government to excavate the fire site, and the Wang family has sent people to supervise the site. Zhang Da, the chief of the police bureau's inspection department, stated yesterday, "As long as we don't let go of every handful of ash, every piece of broken copper and scrap iron, the truth will surely be revealed one day!"

Furthermore, in order to further seek the truth of the matter, the investigation committee paid separate visits to the U.S. Military Police in Xinzha Road and Song Zhipeng of the Chinese Military Police in Penglai Road yesterday afternoon. This was because the investigation committee had previously received information that Song Zhipeng had witnessed firefighters looting while passing through Wuding Road on the night of the fire. It is said that when the fire was raging, Mr. Song saw a firefighter leisurely watching the fire and immediately pushed him, saying, "Brother, why aren't you putting out the fire?" The stolen goods hidden near the firefighter immediately fell to the ground. In order to verify this information, the investigation committee visited yesterday afternoon, but unfortunately, Mr. Song was out on business and could not be met. The investigation committee also went to the U.S. Military Police yesterday to interview Captain Jack Goldmau, Lieutenant Bailev, and officer on duty C. Tzuet, who were present at the scene that day.

In addition, district chief Li Xun and firefighter Zhu Changhe, number 017, who were detained for suspected dereliction of duty in the fire case, have been proven to have been mistakenly detained. After requesting instructions from the mayor, they were released on bail yesterday afternoon. Currently, those still in detention include squadron leader Huang Baoqi, squad leader Shang Zhikui, number 340, and firefighters Dai Guangrong, number 011, Yuan Chengjun, number 108, and Cai Qiaoying, number 587. They are currently still detained in the police局 detention center and have not been transferred to the district prosecutor's office.

Furthermore, according to Police Bureau Inspection Department Chief Zhang Da, who spoke to reporters yesterday, the investigation committee will be dismissed after collecting sufficient information. As for the criminal part, it is planned to be handled by the police bureau's criminal division. The details of the investigation committee's visit to the U.S. Military Police yesterday are as follows:

### Asked Why They Didn't Put Out the Fire, Answered That Many Team Members Were New Recruits.

Mr. Goldmau has many years of service in the former Municipal Council Fire Brigade and has extensive fire-fighting experience. After the fire on Seymour Road occurred, he personally went to the fire scene to assist in the firefighting and was injured as a result. Rubber plasters were still applied to his face and neck yesterday. He answered the various questions asked by the investigation committee in great detail, but he firmly refused to express an opinion on whether the firefighters had been derelict in their duties. He only stated that it was indeed a fact that the firefighters were not working hard to put out the fire. At that time, he met an old friend, number 101 (the old number from the past), from the former Municipal Council Fire Brigade and asked, "Why aren't they putting out the fire?" The reply was, "They are all new recruits."

According to Mr. Goldmau, he arrived at the fire scene at midnight, at which time number eleven was already on fire and spreading. He climbed onto the roof and tried to chop off the lead sheeting. Because the lead sheeting was very thick, the chopping took time. Although he managed to remove it, it was too late, and the fire had already spread to house number five. At that time, he also went to inspect the houses in each residence and saw leather hoses lying scattered on the ground, but very little water was being discharged. A total of three fire trucks from the U.S. military came to assist in the firefighting, one each from the Army, Navy, and Port Fire Association. Because the fire hydrants near the fire scene were either damaged or already being used by the Chinese firefighters, the hydrants for connecting the water hoses were very far from the fire scene, and the length of the hoses laid out reached 1,000 feet.

### Leather Hoses Burst, Hydrants Broken: Firefighting Equipment Needs to be Improved.

Mr. Goldmau stated that the fire was indeed unprecedented and was the first time in his decades of firefighting experience. He believed that the reason for the fire spreading was the wooden shed on the east side of number twenty-nine. If the firefighters had been familiar with the local situation and had demolished the wooden shed first, this disaster could have been avoided.

Senator Zhang asked if he had witnessed any firefighters looting during the fire. Mr. Goldmau replied: No, I am an old firefighter. If I had seen it, I would have given them a beating. Mr. Goldmau finally stated that to ensure that Shanghai would not have another major fire in the future, firefighting equipment must be improved. Burst hoses and broken hydrants will inevitably delay important matters.

### French Girl Falls into Prostitution: Not Favored by Her Adoptive Mother, Life Becomes Debauched.

[Our Reporter] Regarding the case of a fourteen-year-old French girl who went missing in this city some days ago and was found in a brothel, the details of the matter are as follows:

The girl, Micheline Jarmot, originally named Luban, was the daughter of Russian woman Khlopiskaya. Because she was unable to support her, she was sent to Mrs. Kamilov's orphanage. There, a French couple, Mr. and Mrs. Jarmot, who were old and childless, came to the orphanage to adopt a girl. Seeing that Luban was fair-skinned and lovely, they took her home and adopted her as their daughter, naming her Micheline. This happened twelve years ago. As time passed, Micheline gradually grew up. Mr. Jarmot loved her as his own daughter and enrolled her in the French school in this city. Mr. Jarmot owned several properties near the Renaissance Garden on Lafayette Road and specifically named them Micheline Apartments, showing the depth of his love for his daughter. Mrs. Jarmot did not particularly like the girl, but because her husband doted on her, they lived in relative peace. Three years ago, Mr. Jarmot passed away due to illness, and Micheline's unfortunate life began from then on. Not only was she not favored by her adoptive mother, but she was also often scolded and beaten, and she had no joy at home. Therefore, she began to develop outward. She started to socialize with American soldiers. Although the girl was only fourteen years old, she was tall and well-developed and looked like an adult. From then on, her life gradually became debauched, and Mrs. Jarmot's dislike for her grew stronger. Three months ago, the girl suddenly went missing. Mrs. Jarmot pretended not to care and did not look for her. A neighbor, Russian man Noviski, was a good friend of Mr. Jarmot during his lifetime and had a lot of sympathy for the girl. Seeing that the girl had not returned for a long time, he became suspicious and discussed it with a friend. The editor of the Russian newspaper here published the news of Micheline's disappearance and appealed to the Municipal Council to investigate. She was finally discovered recently in a brothel on Park Road. It is said that after Micheline left home, she went with an American soldier friend to another brothel in Hongkou. The owner of that brothel did not dare to take her in. Later, she was introduced by a servant and sold to a brothel on Park Road. When Micheline was discovered, her Russian friends, including Gillykin, took her back. She begged them, "Please don't take me to my adoptive mother's house!" Her adoptive mother, Mrs. Jarmot, has now hired lawyer Plem to file a complaint with the district court, demanding to sever their mother-daughter relationship. Micheline is represented by lawyer Shifushenko, hired by her father figure Noviski. The district court has already held one hearing. The plaintiff claimed that Micheline's behavior was improper and that, according to French law, she should be taken back by Mrs. Kamilov, the owner of the former orphanage. The defendant's lawyer argued that when Mr. Jarmot adopted her, both parties signed a document, so Micheline is actually a legal daughter and cannot be severed from the relationship because of her improper behavior. The district court has now ordered both parties to provide French legal provisions and adoption evidence before rescheduling the hearing.

### Dispute Over Insurance Amount for Pig Bristles: Investigation Shows Only Over a Hundred Crates Destroyed.

[Our Reporter] The Wang Yunfu family, who suffered the heaviest losses in the Seymour Road fire, had 400 crates of pig bristles belonging to Wang Shanqing, the eldest son of the Wang family. The China, McCall, and other banks that held the mortgage had insured them for 695 million yuan, with China, Anping, Taifeng, and China Industrial Insurance Company as reinsurers. Among them, the insurance amount of the China Insurance Company was the largest, at 413 million yuan. Various insurance companies commissioned Guohua Notary Office to go to the Wang residence for valuation and investigation. It is said that only over one hundred crates of pig bristles were destroyed, with a market value of over 100 million yuan. The person in charge of the China Insurance Company stated that, according to insurance regulations, if the insurance amount exceeds the actual value of the goods, compensation can only be made based on the actual value of the destroyed goods. Therefore, there is still a dispute between the two parties. It is understood that Guohua Notary Office, various insurance companies, and related parties are scheduled to go to the Wang residence again tomorrow to investigate and determine exactly how many crates of pig bristles were destroyed.

### U.S. Soldier Saw Firefighter Leaning Against Wall, Standing by Doing Nothing.

Lieutenant Bailey and Officer-of-the-Day Tzuet said that what they witnessed was similar to what Mr. Goldmau said. Mr. Bailey also admitted that he used his sidearm to break the glass of the third-floor window of number twenty-nine so that the water could come into contact with the fire. When asked whether the firefighters were working hard to put out the fire, he initially refused to answer. After Zhang Nai Zuo and others repeatedly encouraged him, he replied that he had seen twelve firefighters leaning against the wall and standing by doing nothing.

### Look at Others, Think of Yourself.

After reporting the details of the rescue operation that day, they also gave a demonstration of firefighting on the spot. Their pumps, hoses, and other equipment were in good condition, and their movements were skilled. Even during practice, the spirit of the firefighters was extremely tense. From the time the vehicle departed to the time the water was discharged, it only took five minutes.

### Investigation Committee Sets Up Suggestion Box.

The investigation committee has set up a suggestion box in the fire scene since yesterday. The public is encouraged to express their opinions on the exposure of criminal behavior and the improvement of firefighting facilities to provide the authorities with powerful assistance. There is no need to sign the suggestions submitted, nor is there any legal responsibility to be borne.

Xuan Tiewu's Remarks on the Fire Case.

Regarding the investigation of the fire case, the reporter asked Director Xuan yesterday. According to Mr. Xuan, the criminal division's investigation report on the case has been submitted to the investigation committee for reference, and he does not want to comment on it. The truth of the case will be determined by the investigation of the investigation committee. However, regarding this case, when I met Speaker Pan Gongzhan of the Senate at Commander Zhengmo's banquet around the 25th of last month and talked about this matter, I immediately instructed Director Zhou of the Fire Department to be responsible for a thorough investigation and ordered him to work with the district chief and baojia leaders of the district to conduct sincere interviews with the victims and nearby residents to clarify the truth. At the same time, he instructed Director Zhang of the Criminal Division to investigate and report, and ordered him to pay special attention to the mistakes of the firefighters in terms of technology and discipline. The current situation of the case will depend on the results of the investigation committee. The police局 is a party involved, so I do not want to express any opinions. The reporter then asked if someone had strongly advocated that the firefighting business be changed to private operation. Mr. Xuan replied: I am also very much in favor of private firefighting. This move can not only reduce the government's responsibility, but also strengthen the people's ability to govern themselves. However, firefighting in various countries is mostly handled by the government. In the former Shanghai concession era, there was also the establishment of a fire department. The importance of the fire department being independent from the police department in various countries can be imagined. Because the fire department is not only responsible for firefighting after a fire, but also pays special attention to fire prevention facilities in peacetime. Currently, due to limited funding, the current fire department is attached to the police局.

### District Prosecutor's Office Summons Arsonist

[Our Reporter] The arsonist of the Seymour Road fire, Shen Qiulin, was detained by the Jiangning Branch after the fire. Although he was released on bail, he was still transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for the crime of endangering public safety. The prosecutor in charge specially summoned him yesterday. Shen Qiulin had returned to his hometown and did not appear, only Shen's wife appeared to answer the questions. Regarding the cause of the fire, she claimed to know nothing. She only said that the fire started on the third floor and that she was immediately detained, so she did not know about the subsequent spread of the fire and the firefighting efforts. After the interrogation, Shen's wife was released on her original bail.

### Western Clothing Store Robbed in Early Morning.

[Our Reporter] At around 3:00 am yesterday morning, six bandits suddenly broke into Hongmei Western Clothing Store, number 141 Changyang Road, by digging a hole in the outer wall. They first used a flashlight to wake up the store's employees, then took out guns to scare them into silence and forced the store owner, Yin Miaofu, and others to get up and hide in a corner. They then began searching for about an hour and a half, robbing fifteen Melton wool western coats, three women's coats, a radio, and gold jewelry and cash worth about 7 million yuan before leaving. Afterwards, the loser provided a list of lost items and reported it to the Yangshupu Police Branch for investigation.

### Thieves Caught, Stolen Goods Recovered - Valuable Jewelry Searched Out.

[Our Reporter] The Jiangning Branch received a secret report earlier that they had learned of the whereabouts of Ma Wangchen, a thief who specialized in stealing cloth and clothing materials. They instructed police officers to detain Ma at the intersection of Wangting Road and Linsen Road on the 31st of last month and took him to the branch for interrogation. According to his confession, the stolen goods were hidden at the home of Xu Mingde, number 16 Linsen East Road. The police branch sent personnel to the location and indeed found some cloth and also seized a jadeite necklace inlaid with diamonds. According to the suspect, this jewelry was stolen by his accomplice Zhao Songbai from the pocket of a foreign military officer at the entrance of number 186 Nanjing Road on December 20th of last year. The branch later inquired with military agencies of friendly countries to see if there were any reports of this theft, but after extensive investigation, no trace was found. It is understood that the necklace is estimated to be worth five gold bars.

### An Old Man Nearly Seventy Still Loves to Break Willow Branches and Pick Flowers

[Our Reporter] Wang Changgen, 68, a ticket writer for the French Tram Company No. 8 from Pudong, his old wife died early, and he lives alone at No. 45 Huangpi South Road. Although Wang is old, he still likes women. In the spring of last year, he abducted Gu Xingdi (21 years old) from Pudong on the road and took her home as a concubine. In August of last year, he abducted a beggar girl, Zhang Xueying (13 years old, from Hubei), on the road near the Great World and repeatedly raped her. On January 21st of this year, he drove Zhang Xueying out again. Zhang had no choice but to continue to beg every day and slept in a shed at the entrance of the Jiujiu Cotton Shop on Madang Road at night. Gu Zhenhua, the owner of the store, discovered this and inquired about what happened and reported it to the Taishan Sub-bureau. The sub-bureau immediately instructed the police to go and detain Wang Changgen and pulled out another woman, Gu Xingdi, from his house and took her to the police局. Wang Changgen claimed that he was old and weak and did not dare to commit illegal acts, but when he questioned the two women, they both said that Wang had indeed raped them. The two victims were sent to Nanyang Hospital, and after an examination, it was found that the hymens of both women had indeed been broken long ago. Wang finally had nothing to say and admitted the charges. He was then taken into custody to await being sent to the prosecutor's office for punishment according to law.

Zhang was out and not found, the madam laughed at him because he was not a big spender and often hung around. Zhang was humiliated and went out in a hurry.

### Japanese Medical Officer at Shenyang Concentration Camp Sentenced to Hanging Again - Tortured Prisoners and Embezzled Medicines During His Tenure - 140 People Died from Abuse.

[Our Reporter] Captain Kuwashima, a former medical officer at the Prisoner of War Concentration Camp in Pan Yang, was sentenced to death by hanging by the U.S. Military Tribunal here for abusing British and American prisoners during his tenure. The execution was carried out at 8:30 am yesterday morning outside Huade Road.

During his tenure as a medical officer, Kuwashima arbitrarily tortured prisoners and embezzled medicines, refusing to provide medical treatment to the sick. In zero-degree weather, he ordered prisoners to stand naked outdoors for inspection. On one occasion, when performing an operation on a prisoner, he did not use anesthesia and even beat him when he cried out in pain. Such abuse resulted in the deaths of 141 of the 1,700 prisoners from illness.

In addition, Colonel Matsuda, the director of the prisoner of war camp, has also been sentenced to seven years. Matsuda was given a lighter sentence because he did not directly abuse the prisoners and is now serving his sentence in Tokyo Prison.

### High Court Notice: Case Handlers Should Be Clean and Honest - Secretly Report Those Who Flaunt Influence

[Our Reporter] Guo Yunguan, President of the High Court, and Du Baoqi, Chief Prosecutor, jointly issued a notice yesterday to dispel doubts. The original text is as follows: "This court handles cases purely based on evidence and makes judgments according to law. All case handlers have been carefully selected and are clean, honest, and do not accept any requests for special favors. If someone is flaunting their influence outside, falsely claiming to be acquainted with court personnel and can be bribed for intercession, their sole intention is to swindle money. This not only infringes on the legal rights of the people, but also damages the reputation of the court, which is extremely hateful. We have repeatedly notified litigants and others not to be fooled by such swindlers. Please secretly report their names and addresses to the court, and we will definitely investigate and prosecute them to the full extent of the law. This court has repeatedly issued orders regarding the rectification of discipline, fearing that laxity may arise over time. We hereby reiterate the previous order."

### Shen Qichang's Name Issue - High Court Questioned Xia Qifeng

[Our Reporter] It was previously reported by the family of Shen Qichang, the pseudo-supervisory committee member and pseudo-audit director, that he died of illness on December 27th of last year while out on bail. The High Court summoned the baojia leader in charge, and according to Bao leader Wang Weishi, he only knew that a resident named Shen Bao'an lived at No. 12, Lane 967, Linsen Middle Road, and reported his death on January 6th of this year, but he could not confirm whether Shen Bao'an was the deceased Shen Qichang. Yesterday morning, the High Court summoned Xia Qifeng, the pseudo-audit director who had already been sentenced to life imprisonment, to testify in court. Xia said that he only knew that Shen Qichang's courtesy name was Huaizhong, and he had never heard of the name "Bao'an." He also said that Shen was old and frail, deaf and blind, and rarely went to work at the pseudo-audit office when he was working there. Very few people knew about his age, background, and life story. After the interrogation, Xia was returned to custody.

### Budget Committee Resolves: Municipal Construction Surtax Not Included in Budget; Finance Committee Requested to Plan for Revenue Enhancement

[Report from this newspaper] The municipal construction surtax for the fiscal year was resolved by the Finance Committee of the Municipal Council the day before yesterday to be abolished, and the speaker and deputy speaker were requested to forward the resolution to the Budget Committee for review. Yesterday at 3:00 PM, the Budget Committee held its fourth meeting, where Deputy Speaker Xu Jiqing specifically raised the issue. After discussion, it was resolved that "since the Finance Committee has decided to discontinue the municipal construction surtax, it should naturally not be included in this year's budget. However, the deficit between revenue and expenditure in the original budget proposal is even greater. The Finance Committee is still requested to deliberate and propose to the assembly how to request subsidies from the central government or devise methods to increase revenue to make up for the shortfall."

The Budget Committee, to examine the expenditure budgets of various municipal bureaus and offices for this year, decided to first appoint commissioners to participate in relevant subcommittee meetings to listen to reports and exchange opinions. At the same time, Councilors He Yuanming, Xu Yongzuo, Wang Naixu, and Yan Yilin were assigned to inspect the municipal government on February 4th at 3:00 PM.

Regarding the case of improving police treatment, raising police quality, and eradicating bad habits, which was submitted by the Secretariat of the Municipal Council to the Budget Committee for deliberation, the committee concluded: "Except for the plan to increase the training of new police, which has already been reported on by the Central Work Review Committee and resolved by this committee, the remaining items do not affect the budget and should be sent to the Police Affairs Committee for handling."

The Autonomy Committee submitted a case to the Budget Committee "proposing to increase the funding for the District People's Representative Assemblies and add one secretary and one staff member each." The committee resolved to recommend to the Autonomy Committee that if the funding for the District People's Representative Assemblies is increased and full-time personnel are hired, the increase in expenditure would be substantial. It suggested exploring whether the District Offices could allocate dedicated personnel to serve in the assemblies to facilitate work and meet needs.

In addition, the committee also resolved other cases: (1) The organizational structure and budget for the National Guard training institution, and the Bureau of Public Works' proposed addition of special project expenses for the 36th fiscal year, are to be incorporated into the overall budget review. (2) The municipal government's request to authorize the advance expenditure of military service funds for the 36th fiscal year from February 1st onwards was resolved to be submitted to the assembly for discussion. (3) The municipal government's request to expand school classes was agreed to, provided that it remains within 20% of the total budget amount, in accordance with the Education Committee's review opinion.

### Dockworkers Engage in Another Brawl; Police Fire Shots to Disperse Crowd

[Report from this newspaper] At the Swire Wharf on the Bund of Jinling Road, conflicts have erupted between old and new dockworkers over competition for work more than ten times since June of last year. At around 5:00 PM the day before yesterday, another conflict broke out. Fortunately, the police, along with military police, arrived to suppress the situation, and the incident was resolved without further escalation. However, yesterday morning at around 10:00 AM, another dispute arose between the two groups over the unloading of the Shengjing vessel, which had sailed from Hong Kong to Shanghai. Hundreds of people gathered, and the situation became serious. Words turned into violence, with both sides wielding poles and engaging in a chaotic brawl. The Huangpu Branch and the Water Police Bureau urgently dispatched dozens of police officers to mediate. Officer Song Shuifang, police sergeant No. 1156, and police officer No. 5917 fired seven shots into the air to warn the crowd and disperse the workers. As a result, worker Shang Jiyou, 38 years old, suffered a right arm injury; Hu Huashan, 35 years old, suffered a head injury; and Chen Wenbao, 38 years old, suffered a neck injury. All sustained minor injuries. After being treated at the hospital, they were taken to the police station for detention, with plans to transfer them to the District Procuratorate for further investigation.

### Layoff Incidents Occur One After Another; Social Bureau Mediates Three Cases; Lehua Cigarette Factory Reaches Labor-Management Reconciliation

[Report from this newspaper] At the beginning of the year, Zhao Banfu, Director of the Labor Department of the Social Bureau, told reporters that if the socio-economic situation does not improve, there will be a serious layoff problem in the industrial and commercial sectors this year. These words have unfortunately come true. The first case submitted to the Social Bureau for mediation was the No. 2 Shipyard of the state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, which has more than 200 workers and intends to lay off 85. This matter is currently under mediation.

Additionally, the Lehua Cigarette Factory laid off 14 workers due to sluggish business. After mediation by the Social Bureau, both parties have signed a settlement record. The terms of the settlement are to follow the regulations of the Labor-Management Dispute Arbitration Committee, allocating severance pay and providing 20 days of wages as subsidies from the factory. Wages will be paid for the period of work stoppage from January 21st to January 31st. All of the above will be calculated based on the January cost of living index.

Furthermore, the Shunfeng Motor Company laid off 22 drivers. The workers originally demanded a severance payment of 1.5 million yuan per person, which was reduced to 420,000 yuan. However, the management still refuses to agree. The Social Bureau is continuing its mediation efforts.

According to the Chief of the Mediation Section of the Labor Department of the Social Bureau, layoff problems are not always due to sluggish business. In some cases, the management is willing to lay off workers and pay severance in order to hire new workers because of poor labor-management relations.

### Sino-American Hospital Lays Off Employees; Mediation Continues Today

[Report from this newspaper] Last year, the Sino-American Hospital on Baker Road experienced a serious labor-management dispute due to more than 40 employees requesting double pay at the end of the year and adjustments to their salaries starting in January of this year. The matter was resolved after mediation by Wang Yijing and others, the Chairman of the Municipal Hospital Federation. On the 31st of last month, more than 40 employees suddenly received termination letters from the hospital and demanded three months of severance pay and three months of living allowance. Yesterday at noon, Director Zhang of the Garrison Headquarters convened a mediation meeting between both parties, but no agreement was reached. Mediation will continue today.

### Most Labor Disputes in January Involve Requests for Reinstatement

After the start of this semester, the situation has worsened. From morning to night, it seems like something is covering her eyes. She used Vocolin eyedrops, but they were ineffective.

### Cotton Yarn Prices Jump Wildly by 500,000 to 600,000

Reduced Rationing of Textiles for Construction is Also a Contributing Factor

Yesterday, the cotton yarn market was booming. Many buyers gathered early in the morning, and prices jumped by 100,000.

### Responsible Person of the Cigarette Factory Association Discusses the Reason for the Price Increase of Cigarettes

[Report from our newspaper] After the Lunar New Year, the price of cigarettes in this city has been unusually high. The prices of various domestic and foreign cigarettes have increased by an average of 60% to 70%. According to a responsible person of the Cigarette Factory Association, since the import of foreign cigarettes has been prohibited, the production and sales of domestic cigarettes have generally increased. The total production of domestic cigarette factories in the city in December last year was 135,000 cases. The production volume in January was slightly lower than that in December due to the Spring Festival holidays and labor strikes. The reasons for this price increase are, on the one hand, the increase in tax by 25% to 30%, and on the other hand, the decrease in the import volume of foreign tobacco leaves. The supply of domestic tobacco leaves is insufficient. At the same time, foreign cigarette prices have risen, and domestic cigarette prices are inevitably rising. The wholesale prices of various cigarette factories, except for previous orders, have increased by 50% to 100% compared to the previous prices. Currently, various cigarette factories are applying for foreign exchange to order tobacco leaves from foreign countries to make up for the shortage of domestic tobacco leaves, he said.

### Taiwan Tea is Developing Abroad: The Second Batch of Tea Shipped to the United States Has Been Packed; Taiwan Cancels Tea Export Tax

[Central News Agency, Taipei, 1st] Following the first batch of 7,500 boxes of Taiwan tea shipped to the United States, the second batch of 5,000 boxes of oolong tea has now been packed.

Taiwan Tea Company is currently planning to ship tea to the United Kingdom and Africa for trial sales to expand the international market. According to the company, the selling price of the first batch of tea shipped to the United States, converted from US dollars to Taiwan dollars at the official exchange rate, is only 40 yuan per pound, while the production cost of Taiwan tea is 80 yuan per pound. If the government does not subsidize it, it will be difficult to maintain. This matter has now been submitted to the central government for approval. The Taiwan Provincial Government has now decided to abolish the tea export tax from February 1st to encourage tea exports. The 60 million yuan loan for the Taiwan Tea Company's Fuxing Tea Plantation has also been fully allocated, with 1,500 yuan lent per jia (equivalent to 14.5 mu). It is expected to restore tea plantations to 40,000 jia this year, according to last year’s entire province which only had 20,000 jia.

### Tea Evaluation Meeting to be Held Tomorrow

[Report from our newspaper] In order to plan the purchase of tea and help tea merchants, the government has decided to organize a tea evaluation committee by the Central Bank, the China Farmers Bank, the Central Trust Bureau, and the Tea Export Association, and will hold a meeting tomorrow.

It is also learned that the Tea Export Association held a meeting of the standing directors yesterday afternoon to prepare opinions for the authorities' purchase matters in advance so as to provide them for discussion at that time.

### Black Market for Klim Milk Powder is Expected to be Eliminated Soon

Recently, Klim milk powder has been quite scarce in the market, and the black market is rampant. It has recently been learned from the exclusive manager in China, Jishi Foreign Company, that three batches of Klim milk powder have already been shipped, totaling 450,000 pounds, all of which have been unloaded at the designated customs warehouse. It is now waiting for the import license to be issued. Once the license is issued, the foreign exchange can be settled and the goods can be released to the market. In the future, not only will there be no shortage of supply, but the selling price can also be stabilized and the black market can be eliminated, it is said.

### British, Indian, Chinese and Italian Companies are Competing in the Singapore Cotton Textile Market

[Reuters, Singapore, January 31st] Although the price of textiles in Singapore has fallen by half in the past three months, it is still three times higher than before the war. Since the liberation period, the price of black market textiles has fallen by 300%, and almost 60% in the past two months. An importer said that the price drop is actually due to the fact that the textiles purchased for export to neighboring areas are still restricted and cannot be exported, resulting in them being stockpiled in Singapore. A Chinese importer said that the cloth imported from Hong Kong recently must be sold at a loss, regardless of the cost, because cheap Italian cloth has taken the opportunity to attack. The importer also said that the price of cloth is expected to plummet because light-weight cloth from Shanghai has been unloaded in Hong Kong, indicating that the weather will turn cold next month. European importers are also importing from Manchester and other parts of the UK. The prices are more affordable than Hong Kong goods, and the quality is also better, with better cotton yarn and wider width than Hong Kong imports. However, British spinning mills are currently unable to supply in large quantities. Indian exporters are also importing cloth into Singapore, which is slightly cheaper than Hong Kong goods and slightly more expensive than British goods, but the quality is mostly poor.

### New Stage, New Planning: The National Education Conference is Scheduled to be Held This Year. The Ministry of Education's Ministerial Meeting Resolved Yesterday

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 1st] In view of the fact that constitutional government is about to begin, and our country's education will enter a new stage, the Ministry of Education believes that there should be a new plan for the establishment of democratic foundations in terms of the system and policy facilities, and the realization of the constitutional provisions on education. Therefore, the fifth ministerial meeting of the Ministry of Education today resolved to hold the fourth National Education Conference this year. Regarding the matters to be discussed, it is hoped that the heads of the education departments and bureaus, and the persons in charge of colleges and universities who are invited to participate, will prepare as soon as possible. The exact date of the meeting will be submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval. It is noted that the first National Education Conference was held in May of the 17th year of the Republic of China, the second was held in April of the 19th year, and the third was held in the 28th year.

### National Science Conference

[Report from our newspaper, Nanjing, 1st] Academia Sinica and the Ministry of Education have decided to prepare for the National Science Conference this year, and the Department of Higher Education is responsible for the preparation.

### Results of Scientific Tests: The Prodigy Has No Genius

Zhang Qingyun's Intelligence is Similar to That of Ordinary Children

[Report from our newspaper, Nanjing, 1st] It was previously rumored that a prodigy, Zhang Qingyun, was discovered in Changzhou. Newspapers in Beijing and Shanghai have published articles about him. The Ministry of Education's specialist, Mr. Du Nianjia, was on his way back to Zhejiang, so Minister Zhu Jiahua ordered him to visit Changzhou on his way to investigate. If the child was indeed a genius, the state could take care of him and educate him. Mr. Du used four methods to test the child's intelligence: one was a picture completion test, the results of which were the same as those of ordinary kindergarten students; one was a mechanical memory test, the results of which showed that he was mentally retarded; one was a shape and number alternation test, and one was a maze test. The results of these two aspects were similar to those of ordinary children. According to the results of this scientific test, it can be determined that Zhang Qingyun is not a genius. The reason why he can attract attention is only because he can write cursive script, and is limited to large characters. Regular script and small characters are ordinary. This should be the result of forced education. Zhang Tong is still being raised by Mr. and Mrs. Zhang, the brigade commander of the First Brigade of the 202nd Division of the Youth Army.

Women's Qinglian Team Wins Over Women's Qingzi Team

In the first match, the women's Qinglian team faced the women's Qingzi team. After the game started, Qingzi's Jian Zhiguang and Qian Chuping scored back and forth, gaining many points, and led by a wide margin of 17-6 in the first half. Switching sides to resume the battle, Qinglian gradually showed improvement, with Xu Peizhen, Sun Fengzhu, and Liu Huishan scoring quickly in succession. Qingzi, on the other hand, revealed many flaws. In the third quarter, Qinglian took a narrow lead of 20-19 by one point. In the final quarter, Qinglian's Liu Huishan made two successful shots from the free throw line, and Sun Fengzhu added the finishing touch. Qingzi, on the other hand, found themselves falling behind. As a result, Qinglian came from behind to win 31-27.

Chenyou Team Active, Decisively Defeats Peer Team

In the second act, Grade B Second Division Chenyou team and Peer team took the stage. Chenyou's Shi Jiuquan hooked the ball into the basket from under the hoop, and He Zeng added the finishing touch. Mao Bingfu scored another point, putting Peer behind 0-6. Chenyou then became even more active, while Peer was at a loss. In the first half, Chenyou took the lead 27-7. Switching sides to resume the battle, Chenyou's Shi Jiuquan played skillfully on both sides, as if in an unmanned territory. Peer only managed to add some points through Hu Huizhao. When time ran out, Chenyou easily defeated Peer 56-22.

All Blacks Team Unable to Withstand, Shantou Team Declares Victory

In the final match, Grade A First Division Shantou team faced All Blacks team. After the whistle sounded, the two sides were in a stalemate for a long time. All Blacks finally found an opportunity to pass the ball into the center, and He Xiaoxian turned and hooked it in, scoring the first point. Shantou's Chen Qingjiang responded in kind, and Lin Weicong made a successful long shot. All Blacks' Zhang Shaoqing did not want to be outdone, and also made a successful long shot, forcing a tie. Chen Qingjiang and Lin Weicong scored respectively, giving Shantou an 8-4 lead. All Blacks were unwilling to be outdone, and Zhang Shaoqing and Lu Dazhen each scored, allowing All Blacks to come from behind. Shantou called a timeout for a secret discussion, which proved effective, resulting in another tie. Shantou intensified its offensive, and in the first half, Shantou took a 23-15 lead. Switching sides and adjusting their lineup to resume the battle, Shantou's offensive remained strong. Lin Weicong scored first, followed by He Lide scoring. Shantou's score soared straight up. After five minutes, they held an absolute advantage of 35-15. The All Blacks gradually became unable to withstand the pressure, and Shantou became even more rampant. Lu Dazhen re-entered the game and replaced Tao Shaosheng, regaining two points, which boosted morale. However, time was running out. When time was up, All Blacks suffered a crushing defeat of 41-63 to Shantou.

### Friendly Soccer Match: Youyou Defeats Jiaotong University; Score: 1-0

[Report from Our Newspaper] Jiaotong University's Director of Sports Chen Ling, in order to allow the school's soccer team to observe and learn, yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, invited the city's strong team Youyou for a friendly match at the school's soccer field. The audience was unexpectedly large, surrounding the field five layers deep, with about seven or eight thousand people, creating an unprecedented grand scene. As a result, Youyou won 4-2, with Jiaotong University taking the lead 1-0 in the first half.

Jiaotong University, with the wind at their backs and facing the sun, took the initiative to attack, with strong momentum. The goal of Youyou was in imminent danger for a while. Goalkeeper Zhang Rongcai was busy dealing with the attacks. After fifteen minutes, Jiaotong University's forward advanced again. Zheng Jingtong passed to the right, and Wang Hongshu shot and scored, opening the scoring. Jiaotong University gained an advantage, and morale was high. However, despite having many opportunities, their shots were still weak, and they did not achieve any further results. In the first half, Jiaotong University had an advantage of 1-0.

During the break, Chen Ling treated the guests with Coca-Cola, and the Jiaotong University students were also delighted. Unexpectedly, when the game resumed, the veterans of Youyou launched a counterattack. Ba Ma dribbled the ball into Jiaotong University's goal area. Qin Dingxin, quick-witted and agile, threw himself forward to push the ball out. Cao Qinfang, seizing the opportunity, flew forward and gently sent the ball in, tying the score. Before long, Zhu Meilong passed the ball forward from the sideline. Jiaotong University's goalkeeper jumped up but failed to catch the ball. Liu Longsheng, in a moment of desperation, scored an own goal, putting Youyou ahead 2-1. Youyou's offensive then became even tighter. Zhu Meineng scored with a bicycle kick, making it 3-1. Jiaotong University's Zheng Jingtong regained one goal, but less than half a minute later, Youyou's Ba Ma retaliated in kind, scoring a goal single-handedly, making it 4-2. As a result, Youyou emerged victorious 4-2.

### Letter of Correction

Regarding the news about the dismissal of our school's Principal Hang published in your newspaper's Suzhou correspondence on January 31, it is completely untrue. The alleged sale of received materials is entirely fabricated and there is absolutely no such thing as a dismissal investigation. We are deeply concerned that the outside world may misunderstand the truth and cause confusion. Therefore, we are writing to request a correction. Sincerely, the Faculty and Staff Association of Jiangsu Provincial Suzhou Middle School (January 31)

### Ministry of Education Decides to Open Up National Textbook

Standardization; Implementation Method Still Under Planning

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 1st] Regarding the curriculum standards and editing guidelines for the standardized textbooks, the Ministry of Education will convene meetings separately, inviting experts from both inside and outside the ministry to discuss together. This is because the old curriculum standards are no longer suitable, and the editing work being exclusively handled by the National Institute for Compilation and Translation is also worthy of consideration. Furthermore, regarding distribution, the Ministry of Education has decided to open it up, no longer exclusively operated by the Seven-Association Office. This is because the original contract stated that it would expire at the end of March this year and end at the end of July. However, the implementation method of opening it up is still being carefully planned by the ministry.

### Football League Grade A Match: Longhu and Longjie Meet Youtai Today; Starting at 2:30 PM at Yiyuan

Today, the Grade A Football League match between the Longjie and Youtai teams will begin at 2:30 PM at the Yiyuan Stadium. Tickets are priced at $2,000 and $5,000, and will be sold at the Municipal Gymnasium on Shaanxi South Road starting at 12:30 PM. In addition to the Grade A match, there will also be nine other matches, including the Grade C League, the Youth Cup semi-finals, and friendly matches, starting at 9:00 AM at the various stadiums in Hongkou Zhengzheng Park. Tickets will not be sold.

Since being promoted to Grade A, Longjie's performance has been satisfactory. Under the leadership of Chairman Cui Shifu, management is strict and training is serious. It is expected that they will win again today against Youtai.

Youtai has always been known as a dark horse, and their combat power is unpredictable. The team suffered a defeat by Longjie in the first round. Today, they will definitely seek revenge. Defender Mania has not returned from his trip to Hong Kong with the inter-city team, and will be replaced by Rishibao and Xue Pansiting. With goalkeeper McNitti, who has the reputation of an iron gate, the match between them and Longjie today will surely be a great battle.

The full schedule for today is listed below:

Youtai - Longjie (Grade A) 2:30 PM Yiyuan

Kangle - Railway (Youth) 9:00 AM Zhongyi

### Crossing the North American Continent: Five Days, Ten Thousand Miles (2)

— Special Correspondent in the United States, Mao Shuqing

Sing! California! Home of Fruit and Gold

California, 15th Dispatch

California, the "Jiangnan" of America, the birthplace of fruit, the home of gold.

California enjoys an unfading spring, and uninterrupted warm sunshine. In winter, the streets of New York are dark and damp, and the lakes of Chicago are covered with snow. However, California still enjoys boundless spring scenery. Friends saw me wearing gloves, a scarf, and a heavy woolen coat, and laughed from the bottom of their hearts: "What a New Yorker look! You don't need any of that here!"

Nevada - State of Wealth and Adventure, Paradise for Adventurers

The train travels from Nevada into California, crossing eight hours of long slopes. On the eastern side of the slope, the white snow covers the body, and the valleys are sparse. Nevada is like a Swiss mountain country landscape, with many small market towns scattered like embellishments in the mountains and fields. At night, the wide rainbow lights are dazzling. A fellow passenger told me: Nevada is the strangest state in America. It is the Gibraltar of the British Empire, the Morocco of France, and the Macau of China. He pointed out to me many "nightclubs" and "clubs" illuminated by neon lights, all of which are aliases for gambling dens. The economic lifeline of Nevada relies on gamblers from all over America, even Canada, who have worked hard for a year or half a year, and come here to "gamble heavily." Therefore, in every town in Nevada, there are exquisite hotels, restaurants, and game halls, whose business is somewhat distorted and relies on the abnormal "gambling industry."

Because each state has the right to make its own laws, Nevada created that peculiar set of laws. For private gambling dens, the regulation is that each "gambling table" pays a tax of sixty dollars every three months, so that its "commission gambling" is legally protected. The relationship of marriage is defined very conveniently in Nevada's laws, so Nevada has produced two world-famous divorce cities: Reno and Las Vegas.

Nevada is a paradise for adventurers and a "heaven" of extravagance. A passenger boarding the train in Nevada said: In the past, prostitution was not permitted by law in any city in Nevada. Since this war, it has become popular. The reason is that during the war, many troops were stationed in Nevada, and some adventurous speculators created this "new business." Over time, it became a habit, and the law was loosely enforced.

"Pacific College." The Oldest Institution of Higher Learning in Stockton, California

(Contributed by Special Correspondent Mao Shuqing)

One Night in Sacramento, Capital of California

I did not get off the train in any city in Nevada. Overnight, the train crossed the high mountains of eastern California.

The first impression of California is "clean." The fields, residences, small bridges and flowing water, and even the evergreen forests and fruit countries, all give people a refreshing feeling. Americans are not necessarily all clean, but in California, there is definitely no feeling of messiness like in New York, nor is there an impression of dirtiness like in Chicago.

I stayed for a day in Sacramento, the capital of California. There, I heard many stories of California:

California's opening up to modern civilization is only ninety-nine years old. The first hero to discover this new world was James Marshall. In January 1848, Marshall discovered the gold mine near Coloma. It is said that the discovery at that time was very accidental. The gold mine was distributed on both sides of the American River, which is a small river that connects San Francisco to Sacramento and runs through the east and west of California. Later, overseas Chinese called San Francisco "Gold Mountain," which is why it got that name.

From Marshall to the present, in ninety-nine years, California has been a territory of Spain. Even now, the architecture of Stanford University is still in the Spanish style.

The development of California has the modern civilization brought by the Anglo-Saxon nation, the management of the Spanish and Mexicans (they were originally one family), and the blood and sweat of Chinese Guangdong overseas Chinese. When California was "liberated" from Spanish rule and merged into the United States of America, Mexico sent 118,000 people to help California fight. I saw that when the new president of Mexico took office at the end of last year, the governor of California, Warren, gave a very sincere speech. He particularly emphasized the friendship between Mexico and California, saying that he was willing to be responsible for carrying forward this traditional friendship.

Governor Warren, California's Premier Figure

Warren is a re-elected governor, and is the unique idol of today's California. A person with a graceful appearance and strong political skills. California was originally the basic territory of the Republican Party. The Republican Party has a strong backstage support. The Nolan father and son of California's "machine" are both strong supporters of Governor Warren, but Governor Warren himself often identifies as a Democrat. At the 1944 Democratic National Convention, Wallace and Byrnes competed for the vice presidency and were deadlocked. Some people suggested proposing Warren. Even now, there are still many people in California who firmly believe that their governor will become the master of the White House in two years.

But who says Warren is not a Republican? An American colleague said: He is a Republican of the Democratic Party, and also a Democrat of the Republican Party!

During last year's California gubernatorial election, there was only one name on the ballot, and he was the candidate jointly nominated by both parties.

I did not meet Governor Warren, but asked many California "ordinary people." They said: Warren's administration is admirable. He himself is a patriot, and he can cooperate with the conservative and orthodox political style of the Republican Party. But at the same time, he is a progressive and forward-thinking administrative leader. He never neglects labor welfare, social security systems, and various issues of veterans. I attended a session of the State Senate in Sacramento. That day, the Senate was discussing the housing shortage for veterans. Governor Warren proposed the establishment of a Veterans Housing Shortage Relief Committee, requesting the Department of Finance to allocate 100 million yuan as the committee's fund, and to allocate another 35 million yuan to immediately purchase building materials for construction in the shortest possible time.

An administrative official lacking vigor would not do that so readily. I found that the people of California like Governor Warren as much as the people of New York like Dewey.

From the perspective of the state's wealth, New York and California are the two states with the largest financial revenue and expenditure. From the perspective of humanities and society, New York and California are also the two most complex states in American society.

The core members of New York society are Anglo-Saxons, Jews, and Italians. The main members of California society are Anglo-Saxons, Mexicans, and Chinese.

Stockton - Home to 2,000 Overseas Chinese

I took a train from Sacramento, the capital, to a small city called Stockton, where I stayed for three days. This town of 35,000 people has more than 6,000 Mexicans and more than 2,000 Chinese. Mexicans run various grocery stores and small vegetable markets. Chinese operate traditional national treasures: restaurants and laundries.

In this small city, I deeply experienced for the first time the so-called "racial discrimination" that I had heard about for so long.

California is the province with the most obvious discrimination against people of color. In the mid-19th century, our overseas Chinese, single and poor, came to this new continent to help the white people develop and create it from scratch, and have always belonged to the servant class. Therefore, the so-called white people in the West in the past had a view of other races that was not as bad as "black slaves," but only a difference in degree. Even now, California law does not allow white ladies to marry gentlemen of color. In certain cities and certain areas of California, people of color do not have the right to purchase land and houses. These unilateral restrictions are unheard of in the same United States, in New York State, in Illinois, and in Massachusetts.

The Situation of Racial Discrimination Is Gradually Improving

California State University has been constantly launching the "Anti-Racial Discrimination" movement in recent years. After the baptism of this war, the situation is gradually improving, especially in several large cities in California, such as San Francisco, Oakland, and even Los Angeles.

However, when I arrived in the small town of Stockton, I was infinitely surprised by the unreasonable ridicule and very impolite words of the female owner of the Lincoln Hotel.

The Lincoln Hotel is not large, and there are more than a dozen Chinese servants inside, from elevator operators to floor cleaners. The work they do is no different from the work done by "black slaves" in the eastern and southern United States.

It is easy to overthrow an enemy, but it is not easy to change a deeply ingrained national psychology that is a hundred years old. It requires the power of long-term education.

Even the Highest Institutions of Learning Have Chinese Students

Stockton is a medium-sized small city, clean and tidy, like thousands of small cities in the United States. There is a small Mickeley Lake in the city, with a towering city hall by the lake. Tram and bus transportation is very convenient.

Overseas Chinese restaurants are concentrated on Washington Street, and there are also Chinese-style buildings, but because there are not many people, business is not very prosperous. Outside the city is the famous "Pacific College," the oldest institution of higher learning in the entire state of California. The school buildings are all 17th-century Gothic architecture, with thousands of students. There are not many Chinese students, most of whom are children of overseas Chinese. There are 60,000 to 70,000 overseas Chinese in the entire state of California. The younger generation is almost entirely educated in the United States. Teaching the children of overseas Chinese to recognize Chinese characters is a mission that is more difficult than ascending to heaven. I remember the second day I arrived in San Francisco, Mr. Liu Boji, the editor-in-chief of the local "National Daily," said to me with great sadness: "Don't expect too much from the overseas Chinese youth, or even expect them to return to the country to engage in construction, that will be disappointing." He said, "They have received 100% American education, how can you teach them to understand China?"

Fruit Made the Name, Gold Increased National Wealth

For the journey between San Francisco and Stockton, I changed my South Pacific Railroad Company train ticket to a bus. The service system and spirit of the Greyhound Bus Company are admirable. Along the way, there were two and a half hours of splendid plains, endless orchards, and endless green grass. The United States is a human paradise lacking "flowers" (because labor is too expensive), but in the Florida Peninsula and in California, even in the depths of winter, there are still flowers to see everywhere. Ninety percent of the fruit in the United States, whether it is oranges, pears, peaches, plums...all comes from Florida and California. When Mr. Zhang Yuejun decided to come to the United States, the plane landed in Honolulu. A friend in Honolulu brought him a basket of California fruit that was considered precious. Unexpectedly, the plane went east and brought it back to California. Not only did he lose double the transportation costs, but the fruit entering California was subject to a heavy import tax.

Fruit created the fame of California, gold increased the wealth of California, and the inexhaustible sunshine and the boundless greenness embellished the natural beauty of California. As I stepped into California, I recalled the carpenters in the American barracks singing "California, I Love You" in waves! It really has indescribable poetic charm. Sing, warriors! Sing, this American "Splendid Jiangnan"! (At the Washington Hotel in San Francisco)

### An International Artery: A Record of the Opening of the Shen-An Line

— Special Correspondent for This Newspaper in the Northeast, Han Qingtao

Sent from Shenyang on the 14th

The Shen-An Line is open! Countless railway workers and engineers are the unsung heroes of this line. This road was the one most severely damaged by the Eighth Route Army. At the same time, it was the Soviet army that first turned it from a double track into a single track. Now, the Fanyang Railway Bureau, with scattered materials and the blood and sweat of unsung heroes, has created a great force.

Wang Fengrui, the Director of the Shenyang Railway Bureau, said at the celebration banquet for the opening to Andong: "Rush repair, rush repair, rush repair, desperately rush repair. The section between Gongyuan and Linjiatai took more than a month to rush through. As a result, the route is not sound, and there are not enough vehicles, because the slogan during the rush repair was 'Opening to traffic first!' The reality had to be this way. The problems from now on are rectification and restoration!"

On the route, the bridges and tunnels over the Taizi River, the Xi River, and the Cao River have become major projects. There are many tunnels within the 21 li, one of which is as long as 2.5 kilometers. The Communist demolition teams destroyed the tunnels by dragging locomotives into them, bombing them, and then planting landmines at the entrances. Therefore, the effort to clear the tunnels was enormous. The bridges were most thoroughly destroyed, and now most of them are open to traffic on sleepers erected at a height of 13 or 14 meters. It is dangerous and frightening. The engineers say, "There will be no problems before the thaw."

A Historical Account of the Shen-An Line

The Shen-An Line starts from Andong, passing through Fenghuangcheng, Jiguan Mountain, Lianshanguan, Qiaotou, Gongyuan, Benxihu, and reaching the Sujiatun Station, which is more than 15 kilometers south of the center of Shenyang City. (From here to the center of Panyang City, it merges with the Zhongchang Railway), with a total length of 261 kilometers, 25 culverts, and 205 bridges.

Initially, it was built eight years before the founding of the Republic of China. When the Russo-Japanese War broke out, the Japanese army repelled the Russian army on the banks of the Yalu River and occupied Fenghuangcheng in early May. At that time, because the transportation of grain and fodder became an urgent matter, the Japanese Railway Corps began to lay a light railway between Andong and Fenghuangcheng. The project was completed on November 3 of the same year, with a length of 61 kilometers.

By February 11, seven years before the founding of the Republic of China, it had been extended from Fenghuangcheng to Xiamatang, and then directly to Liaoyang. Subsequently, with the progress of the war, it was changed to be built from Qiaotou to Shenyang. The entire line was completed on December 3 of the same year, and the first traffic between Shenyang and Andong was held on December 15.

In April, one year before the founding of the Republic of China, the money was inherited and managed by "Mantetsu", and the standard gauge track (4 feet 8 and a half inches) was rebuilt. The survey was completed three years before the founding of the Republic of China, and the route was determined. Construction began in August of the same year, and the entire line started operations on November 1, one year before the founding of the Republic of China.

Later, when the Pacific War broke out, the Japanese, in order to enhance transportation capacity, had a plan to duplicate the main line of the continent. Therefore, they added double tracks starting in 1942, and the entire line was completed in August 1944. After August 15, the Soviet army dismantled and transported away one of the new tracks of the double track, leaving an old single line. Then the Communist army arrived and greatly damaged it. After the rush repair and opening to traffic, there was no longer the convenience of transportation in the past.

Economic Outlook Along the Line

The Shen-An Line is located in the mountainous area of the Changbai Mountain system. From Yaoqianhutun in Shenyang County to the vicinity of Lianshanguan in the south, the peaks are stacked and the trees are lush, so forest products are famous. The people are half woodcutters and half farmers. On the slopes, tussah silkworms can be raised, and a large number of silk cocoons are exported from Andong every year.

At the southern end of this line, China and North Korea are bounded by the Yalu River. Its tributaries include the Hun River and the Cao River, which flow into the Taizi River. There are also the Tang River and the Xi River, which all flow into the Yellow Sea. These rivers help farmers in irrigation and engage in the development of rice fields.

Mineral deposits are quite rich along the line, famous for coal and iron. In addition, limestone, copper, tin, lead, sulfur, asbestos, cement, muscovite, etc., have considerable output. The eastern end of the railway is near Andong, and the western end is west of Yaoqianhutun in Shenyang County. Some are close to the mountains, and some are close to the rivers. It is a plain, and most of it has been reclaimed into farmland, but it only accounts for 99% of the total area, so food production is insufficient, and supplies still need to be imported from other places.

The economy along the line was oppressed by the enemy and puppets for fourteen years. The production of agriculture and forestry and the operation of industry and commerce were all in the hands of the enemy. In addition, the conscription of labor made people miserable.

After August 15, the rivers and mountains were restored. The Communist army entered the railway line area, and most of the factories such as papermaking, hemp manufacturing, rubber, and textiles were destroyed. In addition, the issuance of paper money made the people feel very distressed. Recently, people's livelihood has been slightly restored. In the future, when transportation is restored and factories start work, it may not be difficult to step into the grand view.

Prospects for Transportation

The Shen-An Line is not only a main line of transportation between China and Korea and mainland Japan, but also a hub for connecting Europe and Asia, and bears considerable responsibility for the exchange of passengers and goods in various places. After the war, with the changes in the situation, transportation between the Northeast and Korea was cut off. At present, it is only a main railway line within China. Although it no longer has the status of an international main railway line, it bears a great mission for military transportation on the national border.

Underground along the line, there are abundant resources, making Benxihu and Andong become bases for light and heavy industry. Unfortunately, the industrial facilities have been destroyed and it is difficult to recover for a while. Although the transportation on this line has been rushed to restore, compared with the previous situation, there is a "world of difference" except for coal transportation.

However, agricultural products, forest products, and coal on the route provide a large supply for domestic needs and urban consumption. Once industry is restored, the underground resources of this route must also be urgently mined. If transportation with Korea is restored, it will not be difficult to regain the important position of international and national border main lines.

During the enemy and puppet period, it was subject to wartime control. In addition to passing passengers, most of them transported workers engaged in industrial production, so most of them were production passengers. In the future, most of them will be consumption passengers. If the economy is restored and security is consolidated, then passengers traveling between Andong, Shenyang, Changchun, Dalian and various parts of Guan Nei will inevitably increase, and transportation will inevitably become more prosperous day by day.

Coal is produced along the line, with Benxihu being the most famous. "Gongtianqian" has Tianshifu, the center station, and "Fenghuanqian" has Saimaji as the second. Before August 15, most of it was transported to Benxihu and Anshan for iron smelting. After that, it will be used for railway families and general industry and commerce, so coal is the first in freight transportation.

Benxihu and Andong both had cement factories during the puppet Manchukuo period, so the amount of iron ore, limestone, etc. transported was quite large. Now it is only wood and gravel. Assuming that Northeast industry recovers and resources are developed, the progress of transportation is not without great hope.

Agricultural products along the Shen-An Line are mostly supplied for local consumption, but soybeans, bean cakes, bean oil, etc. are also occasionally exported from Andong and Datong to overseas markets. After the restoration of security, sorghum, corn and other male grains may also be transported to Shenyang and Guan Nei. As for the special products of Andong and Fenghuangcheng, there is more hope for tobacco exports.

The wood in the upper reaches of the Yalu River was mostly bundled into rafts and floated down the river to Andong for lumber and papermaking. Later, due to the construction of the Shuifeng Hydropower Plant, most of it was transported from "North Manchuria". If the "Fenghuan Line" can be connected to Diandian, the transportation of wood will be more promising. The most important thing is that the sorghum rice and firewood along the line are all in excess of demand, and it is also necessary to transport them out.

Observing the current factories, such as Andong papermaking, textile, and tussah silk factories, can be revived. The movement of raw materials and products mostly relies on railway transportation. The food, groceries, etc. used along the line are also transported from Shenyang to various places by railway. According to general observations, once the economy is restored, the busy transportation will often be more than in the past.

Restoration and Rush Repair

The restoration project and the rush repair project of the Shen-An Line can be divided into three sections. The first section is between Sujiatun and Gongyuan. The damage here, in terms of houses and tracks, except for the complete section from Sujiatun to Wujiatun, most of the rest was demolished. Twenty-three bridges were damaged, a total of 45 holes, with a total length of 407 meters. One mountain tunnel was broken, and the vault cracked 270 meters. After Wang Fengrui, the Director of the Shenyang Railway Bureau, and his employees tried every possible means, the restoration work was completed on December 21.

The second section is between Gongyuan and Qiaotou. The damage is as follows: the pier of Bridge No. 17 on the Xi River was destroyed, the route was slightly damaged, the Qiaotou Station was completely destroyed, and the Fujinling Tunnel was partially destroyed. After rush repairs, the obstacles in the tunnel were removed and bridges were erected, and traffic was rushed through in June.

The third section is between Qiaotou and Andong. The damage was really serious. The bridges, tunnels, roadbeds, and steel rails between Qiaotou and Caohekou were completely destroyed. The damage between Caohekou and Fenghuangcheng was lighter. Except for a few damages to the money in the station, the situation between Fenghuangcheng and Andong was good. Twenty-six bridges were destroyed in this area, with a total of 66 holes and a total length of 1160 meters.

At that time, a rush repair general team was dispatched, divided into four major teams, each responsible for rush repairs in the designated section. The first team was from Qiaotou to Lianshanguan, the second team was from Lianshanguan to Liujiahe, the third team was from Liujiahe to Fenghuangcheng, and the fourth team was from Fenghuangcheng to Andong.

The sleepers, steel rails, and accessories used in the above three sections of rush repairs were mostly collected and purchased along the line, and branch lines and side money were dismantled. Under the lack of manpower, material resources, and financial resources, they overcame difficulties, worked hard to rush repairs, and finally completed this arduous task and achieved the mission of opening to traffic.

In the process of rushing to repair the road, in addition to the engineers who did not avoid hardships, the most touching thing was the line district workers, that is, the road classes that ordinary people said. They dedicated all their strength, even their lives, in the icy and snowy weather. They stood in line and watched the train pass by. In their silent silence and hard work, they saw their joy. However, their clothes were not warm enough to keep out the cold, and their shivering appearance was unbearable to see, because they could only receive some maintenance fees!

### Random Thoughts on New Films

— Ma Boliang

Distant Love

Qin Yi, this is the first time I have seen her serene beauty, a tragic change in her eyes, clear as autumn water, like the fountain in the writings of the French contemporary poet Baudelaire, needing no words. Under the pale moon of a good night, gazing at people, a pure melancholy, what is serene beauty? It is the language of these eyes, telling of an era. But the era taught progress and backwardness, the progressive ones walking higher and farther, the backward ones only becoming destitute and displaced, having eaten plain noodles, uttering lofty opinions in vain, wearing a pitiful face of wanting to cry but having no tears. Do not laugh at him, this is precisely ourselves. Whoever cannot surpass the boundaries of the era will remain behind, shaking and trembling, looking utterly embarrassed. The love in life is also just a shameful delusion. At the end of the film, Qin Yi's eyes look through this distant distance, the smoke of the era.

Zhao Dan profoundly portrays a declining intellectual of the petty bourgeoisie. He expresses the character's personality with personal emotions. The play is acted with emotion, clear and distinct. The life of a tattered defeatist is engulfed in the dust behind that car. Zhao Dan is indeed an extraordinary actor. In the first half, his cane and hat have a farcical flavor, but in the second half, it is a clear self-mockery. Zhao Dan's acting still has a kind of harmonious roundness. This means that the level of an actor's cultivation can create a realm.

Chen Liting's choice of material is admirable. Although he ignores the question of whether women should not be allowed to be good wives and mothers, recently, few directors have approached the era like him, so outstandingly creating living types. His directing technique is delicate and clear, but in the delicacy, there is sometimes a sense of stagnation. The tempo of the second half is not consistent with the first half.

The three of them call "Distant Love" and order us to ask ourselves, with half of George Sand's question: "Why do you want to do this? What's the use? What does it mean?" Think about it.

Jade Hall Riches

Looking at the world through a funhouse mirror, absurd and happy, happy to the point of being completely muddled. Even a milkman can become a boxing king, Jue Fei goes crazy. Fang Peilin once criticized American song and dance films, believing that the dancers in the song and dance troupes are just like that, every film has these few extras, and once you get used to them, you don't feel that there is any color. The group of Indian-dressed dancers in "Golden Horse Jade Hall" is an example. Many dancers standing in the back row on the side are short-legged and thick, middle-aged, and have no beauty at all. "Jade Hall Riches" alone is able to be outstanding. Under Goldwyn's vision, although the girls of the Goldwyn class are dressed in the same black and yellow, their demeanors are beautiful, and each one still reflects each other's beauty, like the concubines of the six palaces, gathered together. Wearing red and wearing green on the stairs, walking down the steps gracefully, they are also competing for beauty and charm, and each is a beauty. This point alone is enough to dazzle people. "Night After Night," "Golden Horse Jade Hall," "Yang Nv Nv," and "Splendid Paradise" are naturally inferior. Therefore, in terms of sound and color, "Jade Hall Riches" can indeed entertain people.

The protagonist, Danny Kaye, originally I had no good feelings for him, just as I dislike the newly emerging group of comedians. This time I discovered his loveliness. When he is not making funny faces, he is sometimes quite gentle. There is very little of the "self-mutilation" type of hard comedy. Even if he is playing a comedic role, I feel that some authenticity is needed. Boxing and kicking must be avoided, and nakedness is especially taboo. Civilized comedy is superior. If you talk about cross-dressing, then "Charley's Aunt" is already the pinnacle and cannot be copied again. Danny Kaye, if he doesn't make strange accents, can surpass Ray Milland two or three times. As for exaggerated components, it cannot be overdone and flow into oiliness, but if it is Chaplin's satire, it may be strengthened, because that is digging bitterness. The stronger it is, the deeper the ridicule of reality is. To the deepest extent, Tsurumi Yusuke's words can be used, "Humor and tears are sometimes only separated by a thin piece of paper."

Virginia Mayo's cheeks are rounder and not suitable for high hairstyles. Her hair is draped flat, which makes her look radiant. Her figure also becomes slender because of this. Her figure in the cicada-winged nightgown is more graceful than showing her thighs in "The Princess and the Pirate." Virginia in the color film is also lovely, but I really worry about her. She has no special talent in song and dance, and her acting skills have not been perfected, so it is a pity that she lost a promising future. Vera-Ellen is fat and round, slightly similar to Shirley Temple. Her dance skills are agile and brisk. She has only just shown her talent and is already popular.

Northern Pursuit

Warner Bros. no longer makes Western martial arts films like "They Died with Their Boots On," but still cannot forget hero worship, letting Errol Flynn change a fighting scene, going to the icy mountains and snowfields of Canada to fight against the Nazis. The development of the story is fairly clear and smooth, and the director is competent, reflecting the meanness and cruelty of the Nazi officers, using the shooting of Errol's companions and his own comrades, chasing and killing Indian guides, etc. In general, it has made some achievements. Hans von Twardowski, who plays the Nazi officer, is famous for his good performance in this type of role, and he is indeed not weak. The heroine is, as usual, a foil. Julie Bishop's appearance is slightly thin, but fortunately, she has her own charm, and she deserves Errol Flynn's handsome and brave appearance. "Northern Pursuit" is actually a relatively inferior ordinary film from Warner Bros., and it is rare to have advantages.

### About "To Each His Own"

— Xin Ming

Because of the success of "The Lost Weekend," Charles Brackett won the Academy Award for Best Screenplay in 1945. Last year, he completed "To Each His Own" for Paramount Pictures. The subject matter of the two films is absolutely different, but people in the film city are unanimously praised.

The story of "To Each His Own" runs through the two world wars. A girl named Jody Norris met a battle-worn soldier during World War I. Their opinions coincided, and they were finally caught up in the vortex of love, but they did not hold a wedding, and she had already secretly conceived a child. When the day of delivery came, he died on the battlefield again. So, wouldn't this child become an "illegitimate child"? Therefore, Jody passed the child to a friend's wife with tears. Twenty years later, her biological child did not recognize his own mother. Olivia de Havilland plays the important protagonist of Jody, with a heart-wrenching performance, and the development of her personality is even more profound; it is her most successful film since "Gone with the Wind" and "Hold Back the Dawn." According to the criticism of various Hollywood magazines, it is speculated that Havilland has a good chance of winning the Academy Award for 1946. The male protagonist of the film, John Lund, is still a virgin work on the screen for the first time, and the director is Mitchell Leisen, director of "Hold Back the Dawn."

### Why Don't Benefit Performances Sell?

— Feng Chang

Benefit performances have been performed a lot of times, right!

However, according to the results of the performances, the box office is not satisfactory. Various newspapers have reported this news. Why?

People seem to not often treat it as a benefit performance, but just as a certain theater has invited Mei Lanfang and Cheng Yanqiu to sing a cooperative play on the same stage. Why is that?

We can answer these two questions comprehensively:

(1) The performance days are too many, breaking the record of previous benefit performances.

(2) The repertoire is not like a benefit performance, but very much like a cooperative play; even if it is like a benefit performance, everyone is slighting the head, and they may see its strengths, so it does not raise the interest of ticket buyers.

(3) Although the ticket price has fallen from the initially discussed 100,000 to 60,000, it is still too expensive.

(4) The ticket price is expensive, and since tickets cannot be sold at the door, the ticket sales performance is also poor.

As a result, the above two facts are created.

First, the number of performance days is too many, breaking the record of previous benefit performances; although it is one of the reasons, in reality, this reason and the fact are mutually cyclical, because if you say that it is just because the box office of the previous performance was not good, so you sing another performance, it can also be said to be a reason, but this year's Chinese New Year is even more difficult, so there are more institutions that need relief, so the benefit performance is connected again and again is also one of the reasons. To break this point, it is inevitable to bring a bit of sadness.

Second, regarding the repertoire problem, I don't want to describe it in detail, because I have already talked about it in last week's issue. At the same time, they themselves are most aware of this point. The later performances arranged for Mei Lanfang to sing the finale and Cheng Yanqiu to sing the penultimate were improvements to avoid all slighted head plays. Also, Mei Lanfang's "Farewell My Concubine" used Yuan Shihai instead of Liu Lianrong, which was a repentance of breaking the bad habit that big actors singing in plays must be matched with actors from their own classes. But why can this be broken? Isn't it because the business was not as ideal? This further proves "not until you see the Yellow River do you give up" and "not in times of frustration is it easy to correct mistakes (especially complacent) concepts."

Third, ticket prices are expensive; if there are a series of several benefit performances, and the repertoire is not particularly valuable (the so-called particularly valuable repertoire is something that cannot be seen on commercial plays with money, such as Dian Wei in "Battle of Wan City" in the past played by Yang Xiaolou, etc.), and the lineup has not added any fresh and extremely appealing personnel (the actors in this benefit performance are the actors from various stages these days. Su Zhangtuiyun and Mrs. Du were not included, and the so-called added new personnel were just a few amateur opera singers, which is very lacking in appeal, at least in this kind of Mei Cheng Tan Yang and other large cooperative benefit performances) The ticket sales mostly need to rely on the appeal of those actors, then the ticket price cannot be too expensive, at least within a reasonable range.

For example, "Wang Baochuan" and "Ganlu Temple", the first four performances were too slighted head to arouse the interest of opera fans, so we will not talk about them. Here, we will select two cooperative plays as explanatory materials; one is softer and one is harder.

(1) Mei Lanfang, Yang Baosen, etc.'s "Imperial Stele Pavilion" as the finale, Cheng Yanqiu and Tan Fuying's "June Snow" as the penultimate.

According to Mei Lanfang's "Imperial Stele Pavilion" is a play that he does not sing during the day, today's market price is 14,000 yuan.

Cheng Yanqiu's "June Snow" is also posted when it is "one of two performances". Even if he sings a single performance, then the appeal of this play must be worse. The side plays must be discounted by at least 20%, so it is worth at most 16,000.

14,000 plus 16,000 is 30,000. The previous plays are not gifts in Mei Cheng's commercial plays in peacetime? So the price cannot be calculated. Therefore, the total value of this play is only 30,000. Now it is sold for 60,000, which can be said to exceed the actual value by one time.

This is relatively soft.

(2) Mei Lanfang and Yuan Shihai's "Farewell My Concubine" as the finale, Cheng Yanqiu's "Zhuhen Ji" as the penultimate, the previous one is

Mei Lanfang's "Farewell My Concubine" is worth 20,000, because Yuan Shihai is a new product, the first cooperation, maybe 5,000 can be added, Cheng Yanqiu's Zhuhen Ji, even if it is also counted as 20,000, then it is only 45,000, which is less than 15,000 compared with 60,000.

This is harder.

Both the softer and harder ones cannot reach the current set price of 60,000 yuan, no wonder opera fans are not very willing to automatically donate money to watch it, because after all, people who "enjoy giving" are not everywhere.

Plus fourth, the ticket sales performance is poor, then naturally these few cooperative benefit performances are not easy to sing.

### Blonde

Judging from "Splendid Paradise," Americans seem to like blondes the most. Of the fourteen Ziegfeld girls in the film, seven have golden hair. The remaining three have red hair, three have millet hair, and one has black hair.

### Enlightenment from "Distant Love"

— Tao Xiong

"Distant Love" portrays two distinct characters: one is Professor Xiao Yuanxu, a kind-hearted intellectual with theoretical knowledge but lacking practical application. The other is Yu Zhen, an uneducated village girl who, after being transformed by Xiao Yuanxu, undergoes the trials of the times and embarks on a distant road.

These two characters represent two kinds of love: Professor Xiao represents selfish love, loving only himself and his own family. Yu Zhen, on the other hand, loves the vast populace. Therefore, although they are husband and wife, their different perceptions and thoughts lead them to ultimately go their separate ways.

"Distant Love" clearly tells us that time and life are merciless. They lead the progressive towards the light and cause the regressive to fall into darkness. How much should people pay attention to themselves and to the path of life they are taking, step by step.

Director Chen Liting is not a passionate idealist but a down-to-earth, true artist. He introduces this pair of characters to us, allowing us to clearly see the path we should take. This pair of characters—Professor Xiao Yuanxu and Yu Zhen—are not figments of his imagination but rather two real, typical personalities he found among people. Professor Xiao represents the general decline of intellectuals who cannot keep up with the times, while Yu Zhen represents the young people who can advance with the times. Although our younger generation has been transformed by Professor Xiao, the forging of the times enables us to bravely embark on a distant road. This is indeed the case: most young people are likely to be ahead of their elders, and it must be so; otherwise, the times and society will forever remain in the Middle Ages.

What moves me deeply is that it enlightens us to abandon selfish love and love the vast populace!

### White-Haired Childlike Heart

— Xu Zhongnian

Since ancient times, those with talent often have many affections. The news of Mr. Shi Ceng and Ms. Su Shan's marriage is truly joyful beyond expectation. Every time Mr. Shi Ceng attended a literary tea party or the Saturday literary salon, Ms. Su Shan was always his companion; conversely, every time Ms. Lin graced the occasion, Mr. Li invariably accompanied her. Once, at a joint gathering of the literary tea party and the Saturday literary salon, Mr. Li and Ms. Lin were, of course, seated together. One dish, though vegetarian, was quite greasy, so Ms. Lin used her chopsticks to take it from Mr. Li's plate, saying with a smile, "Let me eat it for you!" Although she used the polite "you" at the end, the undisguised thoughtfulness revealed to me that their relationship had long exceeded ordinary friendship, let alone a teacher-student relationship. The "exchange" in "relationship" had transformed into "affection": thus, they had long been attuned to each other, and their marriage on the second of February was merely a formality.

The ancients called wives "wise inner helpers." This is not me raising the anachronistic slogan of "Return to the kitchen!" but a truly profound saying: in today's world, if husband and wife cannot assist each other—note: "assist" is equal; neither is the other's slave—it's like having a lame leg among two feet! If a "wise inner helper" can also be a "wise outer helper," that is even more ideal. Years ago, I read Ms. Lin's doctoral dissertation, and in recent years, I have witnessed Ms. Lin handling the general affairs of Xinyi Pharmaceutical Factory and editing "World Bi-Monthly." Recently, there was also the "exchange" of "relationship" into "affection," and today I read Mr. Li's letter of joy: "...and came to know the lady more deeply, greatly increasing my respect... Yu and I worked together on the "World" publication, discussing the philosophy of the people, sharing the same aspirations and being of like mind, truly a wise helper, so I seek to formally unite with her in marriage, hoping to assist each other in social reform; truly, Ms. Lin is the only one capable of this": all of this truly proves that Ms. Su Shan is not only a "wise inner helper" but also a "wise outer helper."

Some suspect that the "child" character in the title of this little congratulatory note, "White-Haired Childlike Heart," is somewhat inappropriate and should probably be "same." Ha! Ha! The brilliance lies in this "child" character! I ask: After the wedding ceremony, after drinking the nuptial cup, after being sent to the bridal chamber, the nearly "seventy"-year-old Mr. Shi Ceng, reversing the two characters of "seventy," must only have the childlike heart of "seventeen" years old! If you don't believe it, you might as well consult the marriage expert (having solved over five hundred cases), my maternal grandfather, Wu Zhihui.

### The Spirit of Realism in Western Art History: Nineteenth-Century British Landscape Painters

— Shen Yan

Since the eighteenth century, the British painting world has revealed a national feeling of praising the natural beauty of its homeland. The British landscape paintings of that time were modeled after the seventeenth-century Dutch style, even tending towards imitation. Britain's soil and water are influenced by the ocean and share similar characteristics with the Netherlands, which is one of the reasons for this tendency.

With this kind of tradition, British landscape painting has progressed more significantly than other painting departments and has given much influence and stimulation to the European art world. Since the beginning of the nineteenth century, Britain has produced three excellent writers, namely Turner, Constable, and Bonington.

Turner is a unique genius in the history of landscape painting. The style of his works varies with the era of production. The nature of landscape painting also involves many aspects. Ruskin once criticized this painter, calling him "the Michelangelo of landscape painting." Turner's paintings, on the one hand, stand on the basis of realism, emphasizing subjective impressions, and at the same time exaggerate the form of landscape painting, intending to give a strong and powerful feeling.

If we examine Turner's landscape paintings from a realistic perspective, we can note the following characteristics.

1.  Turner was the first representative writer to depict trains. The train, produced by mechanical civilization, and the natural sentiment of landscape painting are completely different in character; and there are few who dare to use this as the theme of landscape painting later.

2.  Turner rarely uses the simple nature itself as his work, but his sketches depict nature quite a lot.

3.  It is said that Turner once advocated that painters should paint "impressions" and pay special attention to painting the effects of the sun. Comparing this with the reality that the representative writer of the later Impressionist school, Monet, finally created a painting style based on color tone, is quite intriguing.

Regarding the theme and technique of landscape painting, Turner has a strong romantic tendency. Conversely, Constable was a thorough realist among the painters of the early nineteenth century. After several years of groping in the dark, he began to publicly present landscape paintings in 1802. Soon, he felt the weakness of British landscape painters, so he opposed the tradition of most painters blindly following the seventeenth-century Dutch painters and not paying attention to nature; thus, regardless of the needs of general society, he created landscape paintings that faithfully sold to nature. This landscape painting did not seem to gain much praise in Britain, but it gave strong stimulation and good influence to young French painters. In 1824, Constable published three landscape paintings at the Salon in Paris, all of which were works depicting a plain natural environment. He therefore won a gold medal, but its actual effect was even greater. The greatest painter of the nineteenth century, Delacroix, also produced "The Massacre at Chios" at this time. But after seeing Constable's painting, he was quite moved. He immediately took back his own work that had been moved into the venue and revised it before republishing it. This year's Salon was truly an epoch-making period in the French art world. At the same time, Constable's landscape painting became a major reason for the rise of painting in France. Constable's works used lively brushstrokes to depict the posture of nature, giving new life to pastoral landscape painting. He criticized the general ills of the art world, "only looking at old and unglazed screens, and not observing fresh green fields and sunlight." Therefore, his works often contain rich realism in skillful techniques.

Bonington was a short-lived writer. He had superhuman sensitivity. In his short life, he lived in France for most of his time, so he mostly interacted with the predecessors of French landscape painters and also engaged in the guidance of young painters. He also won a gold medal at the Salon in 1824. He seems to be a writer who connects Britain and France with landscape paintings.

In short, the nineteenth century was an era in which landscape painting was particularly developed with France as the center, while Britain rose before France. Therefore, the historical position of British landscape painters in the early nineteenth century was in the two-century period connecting the Netherlands and France.

### Old Wu Zhihui Talks About "Ghost Pushing the Millstone"

— Guan Zhou

"Ghost" means return. All life becomes a ghost after it ends, meaning it has a destination. Therefore, some say: when a person fights a ghost and wins, the person is still a person, and the ghost will become a ghost among ghosts; if the person loses, they will be equal to the ghost, and there is no loss. Therefore, there is really nothing to fear from ghosts.

Articles about the existence or non-existence of ghosts can often be seen in newspapers and magazines. Whether there are ghosts or not, I am afraid even the authors themselves are not clear. In the whole world, there are more people who fear ghosts and fewer people who do not. Westerners believe in Jesus and fear demons, and Chinese people fear even more ghosts, such as ghosts of those who were hanged, beheaded, burned to death, etc. I think even those who believe in the non-existence of ghosts would have their hair stand on end if they were to walk alone in a graveyard late at night! Therefore, Mr. Wu Zhihui, regardless of the existence of ghosts, since there is the word "ghost," it would not hurt to chat about it after tea and wine.

On May 6, 1944, in a letter to Mr. Wei Juxian to decline his eightieth birthday celebration the following year, he briefly said that he himself was bought from the underworld by his great-grandmother and grandfather. At the time of purchase, he was said to have been put into his mother's belly with a weighing hook and born. To this day, he does not dare to remove the dirt from his navel when bathing, because it is something that seals a hole. If he removes it, his stomach will hurt endlessly, and this has been proven by testing. Furthermore, birthdays should not be celebrated, otherwise the King of Hell will know, and his life will be at stake, etc. The old gentleman is good at joking. Seeing the world as it is now, with people and ghosts being almost the same, he often talks about "ghosts."

### Willow Embankment

— Ke Ren

This is a straight and less winding embankment, built up from sand and mud, and covered with lush willow trees. The willow forest extends until the edge of the village's surrounding walls, like a natural barrier, and the village is hidden in the dense shade.

At the foot of the embankment is a sandy river. In winter, the river's center freezes over, like a white ribbon winding downstream, and stones of various shapes and sizes are exposed on both sides, half embedded in the frozen mud and sand, and half shining in the sunlight. The mountain valleys upstream accumulate frost and snow for a winter, which flows together with the continuous rain of late spring, and the sandy river begins to flood. The riverbed is filled with yellow, churning muddy waves, constantly impacting and eroding the embankment. We are grateful to the first person who planted seedlings on the sandy shore, because of him, the sandy river flows straight downstream, and this piece of land also appears full of spring.

Ninety-nine percent of the villagers are farmers: from birth to death, almost all of their time is spent in a small circle of several miles around. They rarely come into contact with the vast world outside. Only the willow forest on the embankment is the most familiar to them, and the embankment willows are also the most familiar with them. The embankment willows know the history of the village for decades and all the household trivialities, and secretly calculate: whose son can already climb the tree and blow willow whistles, and whose daughter is preparing her dowry.

Sandy rivers, embankments, and willow forests—these ordinary scenes are common to thousands of remote mountain villages in the north. When I walk through this section of the embankment willow forest, I feel a sense of intimacy welling up in my heart, like returning to my hometown, like seeing my mother. I unconsciously stare at a weeping willow, and suddenly remember many childhood stories from a long time ago.

### The Cradle of Art: The Aesthetic Ancient Greek Society

— Zhou Gui

Ancient Greek art is now two thousand several hundred years old. However, when modern people see their sculptures, they cannot help but exclaim and praise them. We further believe that truly valuable works of art are timeless. She can transcendently and uniquely maintain her "beauty," not diminishing her color because of all the changes in society. She is forever accepting people's praise. Oh, how great and glorious art is!

The nurturing and growth of ancient Greek art had its own superior conditions. We may as well explore it: First, from a geographical perspective, Athens, the center of ancient Greek art, is mountainous, bordering the sea on the southeast, west, and south sides. In addition, for at least eight months of the year, the climate is very warm, and one can almost go without clothes. People had freedom of thought, loved sports, and their bodies were healthy and beautiful, which should be expected. Therefore, in this environment, climate, and the harmony of the people, it really seems like being in heaven. Having had these superior conditions, coupled with the Greek love of art, it was of course very likely to produce perfect works of art. But there is also a most surprising fact, which is that the ancient Greeks placed an importance on "human beauty" that surpassed everything. Every ancient Greek believed that "human beauty" was above law, morality, chastity, justice, and everything else. Under this belief in pursuing "beauty," the progress and achievement of art naturally created immortal merit. Below are two stories that can prove the environment in which the Greek people lived at the time and their feelings about "beauty."

It is said that in ancient Greece, there was a beautiful woman named Phryne. She twice participated in the Olympic Games, appearing fully nude for people to admire her "human beauty." This was a very honorable thing in ancient Greece. Once, she did not know what law she had broken and was accused. When she was on trial, her defense lawyer did not speak, but simply took off all her clothes, displaying her healthy and beautiful physique. The judge had no way to judge and declared her innocent. In Greek sculpture, there are two female statues, one called La Venus Decnide and one called Venus de Anadyomene (attached image), both of which were sculpted by the sculptor Praxiteles using Phryne as a model.

There was also a beautiful woman named Aspasia, who was also the top beauty of the time. One day, people discovered that she was pregnant, and everyone was worried about her "human beauty." The High Court of Athens ordered her to have an abortion, because they valued "human beauty" more than the child's life!

The factors for the achievement of ancient Greek art, the talent and efforts of artists, are of course necessary, but in society, law, politics, etc., and a favorable environment, are also indispensable. Today's China is still in famine and war. I hope that tomorrow, from the faint dawn of "democracy"—a product of Greece—we will gradually build a peaceful society, so that artists can beautify everything and create an immortal and glorious history. I respectfully and eagerly look forward to it, look forward to it!

### Tang Zuishi's Seal Carving

— Ye Qiuyuan

Seal carving is a unique form of national art in our country. All those who are influenced by our national culture will similarly have the ability to appreciate and create in this branch of plastic arts. Therefore, our country's seal carving art also extends to other ethnic groups in East Asia. Among them, the achievements of the Japanese ethnic group in this area are particularly worthy of comparison with our country's seal carving art. Seal carving was not originally unique to our country. The issuance of official documents must have a seal to show credibility, which is a common custom in China and abroad. The British cabinet still has a "Lord Privy Seal," which is clear evidence of this. However, in foreign countries, seal carving has not yet advanced to an art form like ours. It still remains at the stage of craftsman technique, which is also a fact. The reason why it has not evolved into an art form is originally limited by foreign literature. Despite the medieval monks' writing skills to the fullest extent for Western European characters, which resulted in the creation of various fancy fonts, Western European characters themselves do not have the same rich patterns and artistic meaning as Chinese characters. Therefore, seal carving art centered on characters has never had the same development in Western Europe as in our country. This is just like how "calligraphy" in Western Europe has never had the same development as in our country.

The art of seal carving in our country originated in the Zhou and Qin dynasties and flourished in the two Han dynasties. From the Jin and Wei dynasties to the Xuanhe period, it became a trend. However, the revival of modern seal carving art is actually rooted in Wen He of the Ming dynasty. Descending to the Qing dynasty, the Eight Masters of Xiling rose in our Hangzhou, vigorous and simple, directly pursuing the Qin and Han dynasties. Thus, seal carving was once again valued by literati. China's seal carving art reached a new peak again. The remaining charm evolved into the Zhejiang and Anhui schools. The Zhejiang school was led by the Eight Masters of Xiling, while the Anhui school traced its origins to Wen He. When Deng Wanbai came out, he became a family on his own, forming a separate sect in seal carving, and was highly respected for a time. The Zhejiang school is based on the Qin and Han dynasties, advocating simplicity, which is close to a classical aesthetic art. The Anhui school advocates decoration, and its spirit is actually equivalent to the Western European "Rococo"; this seems to be not as high as the Zhejiang school in terms of artistic taste, so after Rang Zhi, seal carving in the Anhui school has almost become extinct. The Zhejiang school, after the Eight Masters, was followed by Bei Yuan and Ku Tie. At the end of the Qing dynasty, the seal carvers in Zhejiang once again formed the Xiling Seal Society, and for a time the situation was said to be prosperous. However, not long after, Ku Tie passed away, and the people in the Xiling Seal Society are now also getting old; has our country's seal carving art once again declined to this point?

Seal carving and calligraphy and painting are one body. Therefore, most seal carving masters are also skilled calligraphers and painters. Bei Yuan and Ku Tie were both famous painters and seal carvers, and the early Eight Masters of Xiling were no different. Therefore, their seal carving can carefully adhere to the rules within transcendence and boldness. Today's seal carvers mostly pride themselves on being bold and unrestrained, but they do not know that boldness and unrestraint also contain rules. Since Ku Tie passed away, today's Zhejiang school seal carving circle in China has only produced two masters: Wang Fuchang and Tang Zuishi. Wang and Tang are both cornerstones of the Xiling Seal Society, and they also served in the Seal Society together. Wang is from Hangzhou, while Tang, as a Hunanese, devoted himself to the revival of the Zhejiang school seal carving art, and his contribution is particularly indelible. Wang's careful adherence to the rules is more than enough, and he seems to lack boldness; while Tang's boldness is more than enough, and he is not inferior to Wang in carefully adhering to the rules. His seal carving is based on Mansheng, so his art can form its own style. Zuishi came to Shanghai from eastern Zhejiang after the war. We met occasionally, and he carved three seals for me. They are vigorous and simple, transcending the past. I use this short article to introduce them.

### Fire Record

— SS

Human economics are in panic, and the celestial palace is also experiencing a severe shortage of materials. The residences of the gods outside the Lingxiao Palace are all being built simply after the victorious demobilization. As winter ends and the year dwindles, with dry winds and scarce water, the Jade Emperor, in order to maintain the safety of the celestial palace, had long issued a decree to quickly organize a firefighting personnel training class, appointing the fire-prevention veteran Zhurong as the class leader, just in case.

Although Zhurong is a famous general who has been through many fire scenes, he is very muddleheaded in handling affairs. The students recruited into the training class are all people who used to "watch the fire" during the enemy and puppet era (they don't understand firefighting at all). Firstly, the salary is too low, and secondly, it is difficult to find real talent, so they are trained in a perfunctory manner. The situation is only hidden from the Jade Emperor.

During the training process, Zhurong used all his skills and taught them many of the latest firefighting techniques. Until a few days before graduation, Zhurong realized that technical training alone was probably not enough, and psychological and moral training were also very important. So, he gathered everyone for a lecture:

Moral Conscience - Not Interested

"Everyone should know: saving a fire is saving lives, and saving lives requires using each person's conscience and moral cultivation as capital..."

"In order to show our conscience and sincerity, we should sacrifice ourselves in emergencies; and at the same time..."

Zhurong glanced at the students listening to the lecture, and they were all nodding off and dozing off. Realizing something was amiss, he raised his voice and shouted:

"In the future, when fighting fires, in order to test everyone's conscience and morality, a detailed inspection must be carried out before departure and after returning..."

Before he could finish speaking, everyone reacted.

"Objection!"

"We object to this method of despising our personality!"

"Objection... We quit!..."

Zhurong finally succumbed to the uproar helplessly.

Graduation arrived. In order to show the results of the training period, there was, as usual, a performance. Everyone wore helmets and armor, driving new "pumping machines" bought from the United States. Hoses like dragons, ladders high, a grand and imposing scene with all new equipment. The Tianfu citizens crowded outside the South Heaven Gate to watch the spectacle. Many gods and great immortals were also invited from the Daluo Heaven and Fengdu City to observe the ceremony.

The performance was, of course, surprisingly outstanding, and everyone applauded. Because the results were satisfactory, all firefighters from Zhurong down were rewarded by the Jade Emperor, and each received a bit of awarded bounty.

Amidst the praise, only the Ten Kings of Fengdu City remained silent. They knew in their hearts that the firefighters' psychology had been seen through, and the underworld would have more troubles from now on. But the heavenly kingdom and the underworld were far apart, and since it was none of their business, they thanked the host after the cocktail party and returned to hell using earth escape.

The God of Wealth's Residence Burned and Looted

As the lunar new year approached, all the gods gathered in the heavenly palace to wish the Jade Emperor a happy new year. In the evening, the God of Wealth held a grand banquet at his private residence, with singing and dancing, and the sound of pipes and flutes. The scene was unprecedented.

As the banquet ended and joy turned to sorrow, at about Xu time (7-9 PM), the God of Wealth's residence suddenly reported a fire on the third floor.

"I wonder which god left a cigarette butt?..." The God of Wealth panicked and immediately sent a servant to notify Zhurong to lead the fire brigade to extinguish the fire. The servant was a famous Shenxing Taibao (a legendary runner), and in less than a second, he had reached the fire brigade headquarters.

"Fire!" The servant said in a state of panic.

"It's the New Year! Don't mess around!" Zhurong had drunk a few more glasses of whiskey and was already drunk by the stove. The other team members were playing "sand crabs" in piles. Seeing the servant come in, he replied casually.

"It's true! The fire has already burned through the roof!"

"Who are you from?"

"The God of Wealth's residence."

"The God of Wealth's mansion?" One of the team members dropped the card in his hand and pulled the others, saying, "Hey, it's not someone else's house, let's go quickly. This is the first income of the New Year, don't let others get ahead!"

Everyone stood up one after another. Suddenly, another team member said to the servant:

"Friend! We're out of gas in the truck!"

"On the first day of the new year, people are having a happy New Year, but we have to work hard at the fire scene!"

Another echoed.

"Okay, everyone, don't nag! We know what we're doing, we won't let you work in vain!" After the servant finished speaking, he turned back to help with the rescue.

At this time, the fire had spread to the second floor, and smoke was rising from the east and west halls. Although the Jade Emperor had sent many people to help, the manpower was still not enough. The God of Wealth scratched his ears and cheeks anxiously:

"I still have a lot of securities and stocks on the second floor, it's all over now!"

Before he could finish speaking, the fire truck arrived. The God of Wealth hurried to meet them:

"Everyone, please help, hurry!"

"Of course, of course, this is our responsibility!... However, how many safes are upstairs?"

"Many, please rescue them first, the salaries for the Daluo Heaven last December haven't been paid yet, they're all in there!"

"God of Wealth! You're a smart person! We work in this industry, living off the fire! The salary is usually low, and today is the New Year!"

"I understand, I understand!... " The God of Wealth held up both hands: "Ten, ten, okay?"

"Ten?... With your status?" Everyone sneered in unison.

"You guys go have a drink first! Let me negotiate with him and then talk!"

With a bang, everyone dispersed, some went to drink, some brought axes and just drilled upstairs. In the firelight, shadows flickered up and down the building, as if they were moving something. The God of Wealth and his family were so anxious that they shed tears.

Don't know when, the negotiations were done, several people connected the tap water, the hose began to spray water, but the fire did not decrease, the God of Wealth family was watered all over, like a water target.

After burning for a full nine hours, the firelight shrank in the sunlight. The God of Wealth's residence was only an empty shell left, and faint knife and axe marks remained on many charred woods.

When the heavenly palace returned to its usual tranquility, the God of Wealth hired many people to rummage through the ashes. Except for a little charred gold foil and gold filings, there was nothing left. Finally, he found a torn piece of paper on the square, which read:

"Report the police early, lose less! Report the police late, burned clean!"

"Damn it! Can I still be considered late for reporting the police?" The God of Wealth stroked the golden robe on his body that had been yellowed by smoke and almost fainted.

After the fact, the morality and conscience of the fire brigade that had been trained had been proven by fact, and Zhurong was finally dismissed by the Jade Emperor.

### Small Statistics

### Coal-Made Butter

— Cheng Cong

The method of using coal to make butter in wartime Germany was discovered by the reporter in a factory in Wieden City, Germany. First, coal is refined into coke, and the coke produces coal gas. The coal gas is turned into paraffin wax, and the fatty oxygen is extracted from the paraffin wax, added with water, salt, and carrot juice, and then some things are added to make the flavor the same as butter. When this coal-made butter is first produced from the machine, it looks like a long yellow sausage, eight inches in diameter. A British military attache tasted it and reportedly could not tell the difference between coal-made butter and real butter. The factory is now planning to resume butter production.

### Natural Philosophy

— Whiskey

Whip

A philosopher once said:

"Don't think the whip is hateful, please pay attention to the hand that holds the whip!"

Although he fills you high, he grinds himself lower and lower. When it greatly affects your height, he is no longer in one piece.

These young men, how simple they are! Very unified. Thousands upon thousands, all the same, obediently waiting in line, waiting to serve me. No problem at all.

When I pull one out of them to serve me, even if his head is broken and completely destroyed, he is still happy.

I don't know how many of these young men have been destroyed in my fragrant pipe.

"When it shines, everything is over!"

Wind Instrument

This is because he has a charming voice; otherwise, his body full of holes would be very glaring.

### A Decree of Fate

— Sui

Calamity originated on the first day of the first lunar month of the Dinghai year, at 9 PM.

Dinghai (Year)

Renyin (Month)

Xin Chou (Day)

Bingxu (Hour)

Observing the right structure: the year and hour clash, Bing and Ding transform into fire, the heavenly path travels south, indicating a major fire disaster. Gan is in Ren, Ren can transform into water and save the great disaster, but the daily branch is Chou, Chou is the image of a small clown, indicating that there will be small clowns jumping on the beams, and "Xin" is extremely spicy, difficult to satisfy greed. The "Yin" day is like a tiger, like a tiger with wings, turning over boxes and cabinets, splitting trees and breaking bamboo. "Xin" contains gold, fearing the loss of a large batch of gold bars. At this time, Ren water is of no help, the fire will inevitably spread, and the pockets of the crowd of clowns will inevitably be filled. Xu and Hai pig, two constellations in a chain, pigs and dogs colluding together, proving that there is more than one looter; according to the hexagram imagery, in the chaos, pigs and dogs running around, probably every item has been smelled and chewed by them.
