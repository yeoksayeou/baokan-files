### Great Battle in Central Shandong Lasted Three Days and Nights; National Army Making a Strong Counterattack; Situation North of Jiaoji Railway Improving

[Our Jinan Dispatch on the 23rd] The great battle in central Shandong, around Laiwu, Tushikou, and south of Boshan, has lasted three days and nights. Chen Yi personally led 150,000 communist troops, consisting of thirteen divisions, six garrison brigades, eight independent regiments, and local forces, to launch a full-scale attack on the National Army. The National Army, personally directed by Wang Yaowu and commanded at the front by Li Xianzhou, engaged in fierce hand-to-hand combat, unprecedented in scale. Casualties were extremely heavy, with fighting continuing fiercely as of noon on the 23rd. The Qing Shikan Pass south of Boshan is a key objective, with smoke screens and artillery fire filling the sky, visible even from Boshan city. The communists apparently aim to seize the Zibo mining area after the fierce battle at Laiwu. The National Army is sending reinforcements, strengthening its position, and expects to repel the communist forces within days. In eastern Shandong, at Shahe Town and Huibu in Laiyang County, the National Army's Huang Shu division fought fiercely against the encircling communist forces for five days and nights, and had driven them back by the 23rd. In recent days, communist troop movements around Jinan and elsewhere have been extremely busy, with constant harassing attacks on the National Army. A full-scale war in Shandong appears imminent. The Jiaoji Railway's Mashang Station is now safe, and traffic between Jinan and Zhangdian, as well as between Zhangdian and Boshan, has resumed.

[Our Xuzhou Dispatch on the 23rd] The communist attempt to attack the Jiaoji Railway from both the north and south in Shandong has failed. Chen Yi's remaining forces, numbering seventy to eighty thousand, have been launching relentless attacks northward from Laiwu and Tushikou towards the Jiaoji Railway. The National Army is putting up a staunch defense, and had routed the communist forces between Tushikou and Qing Shikan Pass by the 23rd. The main force of Chen Yi's remaining troops has now moved from Sishui to areas west of Laiwu. More than ten thousand communist troops in Zhangqiu destroyed the railway near Mingshui on the night of the 22nd, and the National Army is currently driving them away. The communist 11th Division, with more than eight thousand troops, infiltrated Jinling Town east of Zhangdian from Boxing and Gaoyuan northwest of Linzi on the 22nd to sabotage the railway, but has been driven back by the National Army.

[Our Jinan Dispatch on the 23rd] The communist forces attacking from Boshan split into two groups on the morning of the 23rd. One group attacked Black Mountain, seven kilometers southeast of Boshan, while the other attacked Xijiao, the location of the largest coal mine in the Zibo district, seven kilometers east of Boshan. After a valiant defense by the National Army, neither group had made headway by evening. Furthermore, the communist Fourth and Ninth Divisions and the Second Garrison Brigade, gathered around Taohua and Qing Shikan Pass, about nine kilometers west of Boshan, attempted to attack Boshan from the west, but the National Army is on alert. The communist forces attacking Shahe Town, after being repulsed by the National Army, received reinforcements of three regiments from Gaowang Mountain, twenty kilometers south of Laiyang, on the evening of the 22nd, and fierce fighting is again underway.

[Our Xuzhou Dispatch on the 23rd] The great battle in Jiaodong is in full swing. A portion of the National Army that broke out of Laiyang County has joined up with National Army reinforcements along the Jiaoji Railway, and is attacking the communist forces along the Jinling Town line east of Zhangdian. The fighting north of the railway is extremely fierce, and it is expected that the situation in the area will improve in two or three days.

[Our Xuzhou Dispatch on the 23rd] According to transportation sources, the Jiaoji Railway has been damaged in approximately thirty locations by the communist forces. Many sleepers have been burned, and the rails have sustained significant damage. The communist forces are currently damaging the rails by placing small, yellow explosive charges at the rail joints and detonating them. Japanese individuals are reportedly participating in and instructing these demolition teams.

Corpse Mountains Outside Laiwu City; Boshan and Mingshui Remain Safe

[Our Jinan Dispatch on the 23rd] The focus of the war has shifted to central Shandong, with the Laiwu offensive and defensive battle as its core. Chen Yi personally led over 150,000 troops from thirteen divisions, six garrison brigades, and eight independent regiments, attacking the triangular area between Laiwu, Boshan, and Mingshui. Nearly half of these forces were used to attack Laiwu, indicating Chen Yi's obvious intention to concentrate superior forces, gain the initiative, and strike at the National Army field forces heading south from Lai and Tai, in order to secure his base area in the Yimeng Mountains. However, Commander Wang Yaowu, who is directing this campaign, anticipated this early on. Before the communist forces launched their offensive, he shortened the battle lines and concentrated his forces near Laiwu, dealing the communist forces a major blow and initiating a large-scale battle, the largest since the Battle of Xuzhou. Since the evening of the 20th, the battle has raged for three days and nights. The communist forces employed the inhumane flesh-shield tactics of the Middle Ages, launching wave after wave of dense attacks. Laiwu city was once in grave danger, but thanks to the personal command of Vice Commander Li Xianzhou, one of Shandong's famous "Three Lis," who calmly maintained control, the situation had stabilized by noon on the 23rd, although it remained tense. The communist forces have suffered heavy casualties over the past three days, with mountains of corpses outside Laiwu city, creating a sea of blood. At Tushikou, a key town north of Laiwu, the National Army, with a small number of troops, resisted over twenty thousand superior communist forces. Although the southwestern part of the town was breached by the communist forces, the northeast corner is still firmly held by the National Army. Overall, the National Army is resisting communist forces several times its size with limited forces. Although it has also suffered losses, all sides have unconditional trust in General Wang Yaowu's outstanding leadership and firmly believe that he will be able to overcome the current difficult situation, linking up with the National Army in southern and northwestern Shandong to deal a decisive blow to the communist forces in eastern Shandong. The calm and normal state of affairs in Jinan and central Shandong, which has not been shaken by the blockade of the Jiaoji Railway and the city becoming an isolated island, is the most powerful evidence of this.

[Our Xuzhou Dispatch on the 23rd] Chen Yi's communist forces in southern Shandong have retreated into the Yimeng Mountains, using the Mount Meng area, covered in Masson pine, as their base. Their strength is no more than fifty thousand. A portion, thirty thousand, has infiltrated central Shandong, while the communist forces that have invaded the area east of Zhangdian along the Jiaoji Railway also number thirty thousand.

[Our Jinan Dispatch on the 22nd] The National Army at Qingshi Bridge, Dazhai, and Heiyu west of Boshan, after two days and nights of fierce fighting, withdrew to more favorable positions on the morning of the 22nd to continue fighting due to overwhelming enemy numbers. On the Laiwu front, the city was still firmly held by the National Army as of the evening of the 22nd.

[Our Jinan Dispatch on the 22nd] Fierce fighting is taking place in central Shandong at Laiwu, Tushikou, Qing Shikan Bridge, Hezhuang, and along the Jiaoji Railway at Mashang and Jinling Town. Both sides are cutting each other off, advancing and retreating repeatedly, in an unprecedentedly intense manner. The National Army has largely concentrated its forces in Laiwu and areas to the north, holding its positions and inflicting heavy losses on the communist forces.

[Our Xuzhou Dispatch on the 23rd] The National Army unit under Wu Huawen, which had been holding Ziyang for fifteen months, began advancing towards Zou County on the 23rd.

[Our Xuzhou Dispatch on the 23rd] The National Army in western Shandong recovered Hecang Town and Guoguantun, on the outskirts of Zhancheng, on the 23rd.

### Communist Forces in Northeast Launch Offensive; Lin Biao's Vanguard Troops Cross the Songhua River Again

[Our Changchun Dispatch on the 23rd] Communist forces north of the Songhua River are gathering along the river and have crossed it, apparently intending to expand their attacks southward towards Baiqitun, Xiushuidianzi, and Fateh City. Forty thousand communist troops are approaching Jiutai and Dajiagou along multiple routes. A communist brigade is also in the vicinity, planning to harass Dehui. Yesterday afternoon, communist forces surrounded Chengzi Street, and fierce fighting is currently underway. Over three thousand communist cavalry were spotted east of the Mushi River, and over eight hundred communist troops were spotted to the west, having already approached the Mushi River. Communist cavalry have also appeared near Tumenling on the Jilin-Changchun Railway. The National Army is sending reinforcements to intercept them, and a major battle is brewing.

[Our Shenyang Dispatch on the 23rd] The vanguard troops of Lin Biao's main force crossed the Songhua River for the second time on the 20th, advancing to Chengzi Street, approximately eighty li north of Jiutai and east of Dehui. They intend to attack Jiutai, cut off the Changchun-Jilin Railway and the power line from Xiaofengman to Changchun and Shenyang, and threaten Changchun and Jilin.

[Our Shenyang Dispatch on the 23rd] Communist forces have been spotted twenty li northwest of Jiutai. It is speculated that the communist forces may be planning a larger-scale operation. Fierce fighting is expected in Chengzi Street and Jiutai. If the communist forces fail to capture Chengzi Street, the gateway to Jiutai and Dehui, their second attempt to invade the south will be shattered once again.

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 23rd] Communist forces in Northeast China have launched a widespread offensive. West of Yushu on the north bank of the Songhua River, two communist regiments have begun to attack Qitamu. Another group of over a thousand infiltrated Wutai on the 16th. Their 67th Division transported forces from Dahui to Qian'an on the 18th, arriving near Dayushu, fifteen kilometers northwest of Fulongquan. Regarding the Far East, the main force of the communist 10th Brigade and portions of the 7th and 8th Brigades attacked Xiaohuangou and Laomaoling (Tongbei Hua) on the 18th. A portion of their 8th Column infiltrated near Hengdaogou (three kilometers north of Huadian) on the 17th. Fierce fighting is taking place in all of the above areas.

[Another Dispatch] According to military sources, communist forces north of the Songhua River have been building up their strength along the banks of the river in recent days and transporting supplies northward. Communist fortifications have been built at key locations along the north bank of the Songhua River, covered with snow and branches. Heavy communist forces are stationed in the area from Shushu County and Tuanshanzi to Xiushuidianzi and are continuously gathering troops along the banks of the Songhua River, apparently with the intention of invading the south at an opportune moment.

[Another Dispatch] It is reported that communist forces in the area north of Huadian are currently attacking Hengdaogou and Jinshazigou with a force of approximately five thousand. A portion has infiltrated the Yimianpo railway southeast of Shuangcheng Town. The National Army is currently dispersing to suppress them. Several hundred communist troops are carrying out raids in the area of Fulongquan and Sanshengyu. Since the 18th, two communist brigades have launched a fierce attack on Guzi Mountain and are currently engaged in fierce fighting with the National Army. The communist forces have announced that they will mobilize twenty regiments to launch another offensive in the area between Yongji and Dehui. The communist forces that have infiltrated south of the river amount to eight regiments.

### Passenger Transport Resumes Between Kaifeng and Minquan Yesterday

[Our Xuzhou Dispatch on the 23rd] The repair work on the Bianxu and Xuhai sections of the Longhai Railway is underway. Under the personal supervision of Deputy Director Wu Shi'en, who rushed to Xuzhou, the daredevil repair teams are working day and night to overcome the difficulty of insufficient sleepers using the "seven instead of twelve" method, an economical approach that saves labor, materials, and money, and is unprecedented in the history of Chinese transportation. The repair work on the Xuhai section is also proceeding smoothly and is expected to reach the Grand Canal within a week. However, the full restoration of the Xuhai section is not expected until June of this year due to extensive damage to the steel rails.

[Central News Agency, Kaifeng, 23rd] Passenger and freight transport on the Bianqiu (Kaifeng-Shangqiu) section of the Longhai Railway has been suspended since the communist forces harassed and damaged the line. Currently, the ten kilometers between Liuhe and Xiaoba and the ten kilometers between Xiaoba and Shangqiu are still being actively repaired by the railway bureau.

The trains depart from Kaifeng at 8:00 AM every morning and return to Kaifeng in the evening of the same day.

Accordingly, the Youth Party's participation in the Legislative and Control Yuans and the Political Consultative Council totals thirty, the same number proposed by the Democratic Socialist Party. However, the Youth Party has twenty-three more participants in the Constitutional Implementation Promotion Association than the Democratic Socialist Party because the Youth Party has twice as many National Assembly representatives as the Democratic Socialist Party.

### Guizhou Bans Grain Exports; Chengdu Cracks Down on Black Market for Gold

Ganzhou Jewelry Merchants Gather

[Central News Agency, Guiyang, 23rd] In order to stabilize grain prices, the Guizhou Provincial Government has strictly prohibited the export of grain.

[Central News Agency, Chengdu, 23rd] After the cessation of gold trading, the market in Chengdu was quiet for a time. In the last two days, black market trading has been detected again.

### An Economic Expert Discusses the Price of Xincao Currency

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 23rd] After the price of gold was changed to 480,000 and the price of U.S. dollars was changed to 12,000 yuan, some people believed that the price of gold was too low, which would put some people who bought gold with their hard-earned income for fear that the legal currency would continue to depreciate at a disadvantage. When reporters asked an economic expert about this, they were told that changing the gold price to 480,000 was related to changing the exchange rate to 12,000 yuan. Although this number is very different from the past 7 to 8 million, gold is ultimately a luxury and not a daily necessity. Those who hold a small amount of gold will not endanger their livelihoods even if they suffer losses. The government's purpose is to crack down on large households, so it cannot be blamed for improper government measures. After the U.S. dollar is changed to 12,000 yuan, the import of foreign goods can be slightly reduced. Other countries have also adopted this policy.

### Restrictions on Imports of Hemp and Hemp Bags

At a price of one U.S. dollar per bag, the import quota is at most just over 1.2 million bags, which is not enough to meet the national needs.

### Joint Supervision Commissioner of Guangdong and Guangxi Issues Written Statement

[Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 23rd] Liu Houwu, the Joint Supervision Commissioner of Guangdong and Guangxi, recently issued a written statement on the incident in which Feng Chenggong, manager of the Guangzhou branch of the Central Bank, refused inspection, detailing the circumstances of the incident. The statement cited Feng's reasons for refusing inspection: "The Central Bank is a national bank and has a major mission. Unless a formal letter is first notified and the bank requests instructions from the headquarters, it does not dare to expose any situation within the bank without authorization." In his statement, Liu pointed out the illegal aspects of Feng's case and said: According to the regulations, it is permissible to notify the police to enforce the blockade, but fearing that it would affect other public financial businesses, he sent a telegram to the Supervisory Yuan for instructions in order to be cautious. Yesterday, he received a telegram from the bank saying that if there are any inquiries in the future, it is hoped that a formal letter will be prepared and that the facts will be answered truthfully. However, many days have passed and the situation has changed. Even if another investigation is carried out, it is difficult to obtain the truth. He has submitted another report to the Supervisory Yuan for instructions.

### Collecting Information on the Dalian and Lüshun Issue: Foreign Minister Wang Departs Beiping for Shenyang, Will Return to Nanjing After a Three-Day Stay in the Northeast

[Our Beiping Dispatch of the 23rd] Foreign Minister Wang Shijie is scheduled to fly to Shenyang on the 24th to collect information on the Chinese Changchun Railway and the Dalian and Lüshun issue. There are rumors here that Wang will go to Moscow, and that the Soviet Union will send people to the Northeast to negotiate with Wang. According to someone, these two statements are unreliable. Relatively minor issues can be resolved locally in the Northeast. Special Commissioners for Foreign Affairs are already in the Northeast, while major issues will be decided in Nanjing, or even resolved through international negotiations, and will certainly not be negotiated in the Northeast. The speaker, when discussing the Chinese Changchun Railway, stated: According to the Sino-Soviet Treaty, two three-person committees were established: one to handle the valuation of the Chinese Changchun Railway, and the other to draft detailed rules and regulations. However, no formal meeting has been held to date. Of the three representatives sent by China, it is said that two went to the Northeast for inspection and held informal meetings with the three Soviet representatives. However, because there were only two people and one was missing, and the materials and documents were also incomplete, the results were not satisfactory. The two people have been dismissed, and no one has been sent again yet.

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 23rd] Foreign Minister Wang Shijie, accompanied by his wife, went to Fragrant Hills, the Summer Palace, and other places to visit Juesheng Temple at 9:30 AM on the 23rd, and visited Tsinghua and Yanjing Universities.

Wang is scheduled to leave Beiping by special plane on the morning of the 24th and fly to Shenyang, possibly going to Changchun. He is expected to stay in the Northeast for three days before returning to Nanjing.

[French News Agency, Nanjing, 23rd] Sources close to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs acknowledged today that the issue of the Dalian port "could" be one of the objectives of Foreign Minister Wang's trip to the Northeast. However, they categorically denied reports that the Foreign Minister will go to Moscow or intends to negotiate with Soviet officials in the Northeast.

### Beiping Municipal Government Actively Preparing to Supply Daily Necessities to Public Servants and Teachers; Executive Yuan Has Given Instructions on Three Major Principles

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 23rd] Director Xie Huishou of the Social Affairs Bureau recently told reporters: The municipal government is now actively preparing to supply the daily necessities of more than 100,000 public servants and teachers in the capital in the shortest possible time. The Executive Yuan has given instructions on three major principles for this measure: (1) Common problems of the supplied agencies shall be managed by the Executive Yuan; (2) General problems between material supply agencies and sales agencies shall be managed by the municipal government; (3) Individual problems between material supply agencies and sales agencies shall be the individual responsibility of the supply agencies. According to these three major principles, the municipal government will only handle general administrative and daily affairs. It will not handle the issuance of vouchers or the distribution of funds and materials, and the division of powers and responsibilities is very clear. As for the distribution method, cooperatives will be fully utilized, and several stores will be specially contracted through trade associations to become sales stores. In this way, every public servant and teacher can be conveniently located near their residence to purchase the inexpensive supplies they need, without the cumbersome procedures of the past rationing system. The government does not need to add a large number of personnel, saving expenses. This is truly an advanced method derived from experience.

### International Emergency Food Committee Allocates Siamese Rice to Our Country

We Will Send Ships to Collect It Ourselves

[Central News Agency, Bangkok, 21st] According to Xiao Songqin, our representative to the Siamese Rice and Food Joint Committee, only 3,000 tons of the 25,000 tons of Siamese rice allocated to China by the International Emergency Food Committee for the first half of this year can currently be obtained. The main reason is that the transportation situation is poor, which has delayed the rice being sent to Bangkok for milling. It is learned that 16,400 tons of the 30,000 tons of rice originally scheduled to be distributed to China in the second half of this year were later allocated to Malaya, India, and other parts of Southeast Asia for some reason. This rice will be returned to our country around March of this year, but since UNRRA is now reluctant to be responsible for transportation, it may be transported by our country sending ships to collect it itself.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 23rd] In order to simplify and clarify the procedures for reporting compensation for wounded and deceased officers and soldiers in various units, without the need for repeated transfers, so that the officers and soldiers can receive compensation benefits as soon as possible, the central government has specially stipulated that the units in charge of reporting compensation cases should instruct the relevant units to follow the following methods: A. For the Army: (1) The division and independent regiment/battalion units will be the reporting units, without the need for transfers or separate filings. However, compensation cases for personnel of colonel rank and above will be transferred by a higher-level agency. (2) Higher-level command units above the army will compile and handle compensation cases for their subordinate units. (3) Compensation cases for officers and soldiers of security teams will be reported by the Provincial Security Command. (4) Compensation cases for officers and soldiers of conscription agencies will be reported by the Provincial Military Management District. (5) Compensation cases for officers and soldiers of units under the fortress command will be reported by the respective fortress commands. B. Compensation cases for wounded and deceased naval officers and soldiers will be reported by the Naval Headquarters. C. Compensation cases for wounded and deceased air force officers and soldiers will be reported by the Air Force Headquarters. D. Units and agencies should immediately re-investigate and report compensation cases for officers and soldiers who were wounded or killed during the War of Resistance. Compensation cases for officers and soldiers wounded or killed in subsequent pacification operations should be submitted in accordance with the new regulations. E. All applications for compensation for the wounded, deceased, or missing (captured) officers and soldiers of the above units and agencies should be sent directly to the Fuxu Office of the Joint Logistics Headquarters for prompt review and approval. For those who have already submitted applications for compensation, a list should be compiled and registered, distinguishing between those that have been approved and those that have not. If a compensation application form has been submitted but no reply has been received for a long time, the date and document number of the registration should be used to request expedited processing without submitting another application form to avoid duplication. It is also learned that, in view of the recent general increase in prices, in order to take care of the living conditions of the families of wounded and deceased officers and soldiers, the authorities have obtained approval from Chairman Chiang to increase the standards for special compensation for division and regimental commanders, with 30 million yuan for division commanders and deputy division commanders killed in action, 20 million yuan for brigade commanders and deputy brigade commanders, and 10 million yuan for regimental commanders. The standards for other ranks are also under review.

### Northeastern Treasures Are Rare in the World

[Central News Agency, Jilin, 23rd] The richness, variety, and quality of the products in the magnificent mountains and rivers of Northeast China are unmatched not only in other parts of the country but also in the world geographically. Forests, minerals, agricultural products, and fisheries are all abundant. The great rivers and mountains also have unique and rare products that are famous far and wide. The Changbai and Xing'an mountain ranges are home to lynx, black foxes, sables, and other animals, whose fur is highly valued by people around the world. The precious medicinal materials, such as ginseng, deer antlers, and frog oil, are sold throughout the country and are unparalleled tonics. Among them, frog oil is made from frogs collected from mountain springs. Its flesh is full of oil and white as ivory, making it particularly rare. The Songhua River is extremely rich in fish, including carp, bream, mandarin fish, perch, and various freshwater fish. Even in winter, when fishing through the ice, every net is full. Whitefish and carp are especially famous and were tributes during the Qing Dynasty. Tourists who come to Jilin now all enjoy them and praise them. Pearls are also produced in the deep waters of the lower reaches of the Songhua River. The Qing court even established an official to manage this. However, due to years of war and displacement, all industries have declined. Rare furs, except for old stocks, have long disappeared from the market. Although the price of sable fur has reached 800,000 yuan (all in Northeastern circulating currency), it is still difficult to buy. Old mountain ginseng costs 18,000 yuan per mace, cultivated ginseng costs 1,500 yuan, deer antlers cost 15,000 yuan per tael for high quality, 9,000 yuan for medium quality, and 7,000 yuan for ordinary quality. However, wild ginseng and wild deer are mostly produced in the mountainous areas controlled by the Communist army, and the supply is extremely scarce. Therefore, there is more cultivated ginseng on the market. Many farmers in Wula Street and the surrounding villages of Jilin raise deer, so the supply of deer antlers is still available. The main production areas of frog oil are the humid mountainous areas of Huadian, Jiaohe, and Panshi. Currently, about 1 million frogs can be harvested each year, with each 100 frogs yielding one catty of oil, priced at 7,000 yuan per catty. The fish production in the Songhua River, in Jilin Province alone, used to be over 10 million catties per year, supporting about 10,000 people. There were also fishing organizations, but now they are all scattered and sold without statistics. The Jilin Provincial Construction Department is planning to carry out large-scale fishing and breeding in reservoirs next to the Xiaoxingman Power Plant. The lowest price for fish is 100 yuan, and the highest price for whitefish is 300 yuan. Pearls are produced in Ningjin, Heilongjiang Province, which has not yet been recovered. The people are struggling to survive and probably have no time to explore. As the saying goes, the "Three Treasures of Jilin" are ginseng, sable fur, and Wula grass. This is actually a wild plant that grows everywhere. After drying, it is long and soft and is used to fill leather shoes, making "Wula shoes" that keep warm and prevent moisture. People rely on it to get through the icy and snowy winters.

### Case of the Destruction of the Suzhou News: Each Side Holds Its Own View

Jiangsu Education Department Will Send Personnel to Thoroughly Investigate

[Our Suzhou Dispatch, 23rd] Regarding the issue of the Suzhou News being destroyed by students from the Suzhou Provincial Women's Normal School, Provincial Chairman Wang telegraphed the county government to earnestly mediate and expressed his regret for the students' emotional impulsiveness due to a lack of rational control. He deeply hoped that the students' emotions could be transformed from conflict to harmony in the future. However, during the investigation by the county government today, both sides held their own views. The Suzhou News believed that the news had been corrected several times, and the students' request for an apology and the surrender of the reporter exceeded the scope of the publication law. When the matter was still under discussion and had not been rejected, the students destroyed equipment and paper, which was clearly a planned action. The students from the two schools believed that protecting the school's reputation was a matter of course, and even if the actions were inappropriate, they should not be regarded as excessive. Therefore, this case will probably have to be directly discussed by the provincial party headquarters and the education department before it can be resolved satisfactorily. The education department has decided to send personnel to Suzhou on the 24th to thoroughly investigate the truth.

### Haining Jue-Character Seawall to Be Repaired with Concrete

The search lasted about an hour before they fled towards the southwest. The estimated losses amount to approximately 20 million yuan.

### Should a Property Tax Be Levied?

It is heard that the National Direct Taxation Conference, in its project of opening up new tax sources, has discussed the levy of a one-time property tax. We have not yet seen the contents of the proposal. Whether it will be passed or not, and whether the government will approve its implementation after it is passed, are still unknown.

At present, finance is extremely difficult, and banknotes have to be issued from time to time to make up for the deficit, resulting in unstable phenomena such as currency inflation, high prices, and high wages. In order to alleviate or stop these phenomena, it is theoretically indisputable to use other methods such as increasing taxes to replace them. However, the levy of a one-time property tax has too many drawbacks and is too difficult to implement, so it is necessary to carefully review it.

First, there is too little basis, that is to say: the targets of taxation are too scattered and too general, and there is no complete material to rely on. Not to mention movable property, even immovable property is easier to handle, no more than houses and real estate. Everyone knows that now the most unfavorable and the most disadvantaged are the landlords. Their various taxes are constantly increasing, while their income - rent - is subject to various restrictions, even to the point that it is not enough to cover expenses, let alone profit, so that the construction industry has completely stopped and the housing shortage is serious everywhere. In this state, if a large exploitation is added ruthlessly, is it reasonable? Is it fair?

The land originally had land tax, and since the military uprising, countless surcharges and apportionments have been added. The general farmers have long felt that harsh government is like a tiger, and there is no way to go. As a result, the wasteland is increasing day by day, and the countryside is drastically declining. The central government knows its suffering, so after the victory, it immediately ordered the exemption of land tax for one year, and repeatedly issued orders strictly prohibiting apportionments. Although it has not been very effective in practice, it can also prove that their burden has really reached the point where it cannot be increased. What's more, after the war, many counties have lost their nationality and cannot be sorted out for a while. They have to use rough and ready methods such as declaration or mu donation to levy taxes arbitrarily to temporarily relieve the urgent need. How can we add insult to injury and come up with another unreasonable accumulation to increase their burden and pain?

Taking large cities such as Shanghai and Nanjing as examples, there are many wealthy merchants and dignitaries. It seems reasonable and reasonable to take a one-time tax from their property to help the country's needs. Unfortunately, most of their property is gold bars, diamonds, foreign currency, antiques, calligraphy and painting, and other valuables, which are actually very easy to hide and very difficult to investigate. It is said that the estate tax has been very ordinary since it was levied. Even the families of several well-known rich people cannot collect a considerable amount of tax. It can be seen that the property tax is really difficult to handle, especially the movable property part, which cannot meet the expectations of the general public. In case we disregard the facts and resolutely implement it, it is nothing more than a great disaster for the powerless and unpowerful lower classes.

Second, the technique is too clumsy, that is to say: the means of collection is not high enough. Let me quote the chairman's words to prove this. In his speech on the 16th, there is the following sentence:

Therefore, the collection of income tax and various direct taxes has not achieved significant results. Now we should not seek precision in calculation, but instead lead to prolonged days, and we should adopt a swift and effective collection method. If this causes individuals to bear the burden, there may be an increase, then they will unanimously support the government,... and unanimously abide by it.

The current income tax and various direct taxes have been promoted for a long time and have already established a foundation. However, it is inevitable that they will be protracted and ineffective. What's more, the property tax is a new tax with no foundation at all. Its scope is extensive, and its content is complex, far from being comparable to income tax. Even if the people unanimously support the government and are willing to bear the burden, there may be an increase. We believe that, according to the current personnel and institutions, we may still not be able to achieve swift and effective results.

When it comes to taxes, the more basic the better. Even if there is a lack in theory, but it has been practiced for a long time and has become a habit. The unreasonable parts are also what we think of as opening up new taxes. It is always better to rectify the old taxes, and the most important thing in rectifying the old taxes is to remedy the deficiencies. Since the current income tax and various direct taxes are calculated inaccurately, take too long, and are not significantly effective, then the right medicine should naturally be used to solve the problem. This responsibility is irrefutable for those who handle direct taxes. It is too uneconomical to leave aside the existing taxes that can be rectified and should be rectified, and to rack our brains to find new objects that are protracted and difficult to calculate to increase revenue.

### Before Formal Negotiations on Amending the Alliance, Britain and the Soviet Union Seek Economic Understanding; Hope for Improvement in Current Relations Between the Two Countries

[United Press, London, 22nd] According to sources close to the British Foreign Office, the Soviet Union has proposed reaching a full understanding of the world's security needs and concluding an economic agreement before amending the alliance with Britain. According to British sources, the Soviet side has proposed that the future relations between the two countries cannot be unrelated to overseas transportation, future access to raw materials, world trade, and so-called non-independent territories. It is also heard that, in addition to being willing to continue to maintain the political alliance concluded in 1942 with Britain, the Soviet Union has also expressed its willingness to adjust economic relations with Britain. British foreign affairs experts believe that the Soviet Union now has a clear sign that it is willing to obtain a full economic understanding with Britain to supplement the political alliance treaty. The Soviet Union deeply hopes that Britain will provide a large number of machines and other means of production in exchange for raw materials from the Soviet Union. Trade talks between Britain and the Soviet Union have been going on for some time, but have been stranded due to difficulties in the goods supplied and needed by both sides. The Soviet Union needs British hardware, engines, textile machinery, motors, boilers, cranes, and other heavy industrial equipment. Last December, Britain submitted a list of goods it needed to the Soviet Union, with timber occupying an important position. Although British Minister of Commerce Cripps expressed his hope that future British-Soviet trade could be fully expanded, the Soviet trade delegation to Britain has returned home for consultations. Last week, Moscow Radio broadcast in English that there is great hope for post-war economic cooperation between Britain and the Soviet Union, and declared that the Soviet system does not create trade barriers for any foreign economic relations.

### Marshall Talks About the International Situation: The World Is Still Restless and There Is No Real Peace; He Encourages the People to Work Hard to Take on Leadership Responsibilities

[Central News Agency, New York, 22nd] Since taking office as Secretary of State, Marshall delivered his first public speech at Princeton University today, saying that the United States' leading assistance is indispensable for the restoration of peace and democratic progress in many countries. The attitude of Americans towards international affairs has serious shortcomings. He said that we have stopped the war, but there is still no real peace. At home, we are in a transition from a wartime economy to a peaceful economy. In Europe and Asia, there is still famine, and the relations between the great powers are changing. We still need to obtain order from chaos, and peace is still to be won, but how much this can be achieved will largely depend on the American people. Other countries are exhausted economically, financially, and materially. Marshall asked the American people to pay more attention to the historical perspective when considering the international situation. He criticized the bystander attitude and especially asked young people to have a real understanding of history and to develop a sense of responsibility for world order and security. When Marshall mentioned China in his speech, he only expressed his decision to celebrate Washington's birthday in China.

### US Trusteeship Plan: Britain and the Soviet Union Still Disagree

Security Council Scheduled to Discuss the Matter the Day After Tomorrow

[United Press, New York, 22nd] Informed sources said today that the United States, encountering opposition from Britain and the Soviet Union, does not intend to demand immediate acceptance of the United Nations' trusteeship plan for the former Japanese mandated islands in the Pacific. US Representative Austin is prepared to leave the plan on the Security Council's agenda once it is submitted. However, the United States will clearly state its intention to remain on the islands. When the Security Council meets on the 25th, the United States will request that the Marshall, Caroline, and Mariana Islands be designated as military strategic areas under US administration. Britain has indicated that it will reiterate its opposition. London believes that such a step is absolutely impossible in law until the peace treaty with Japan is signed. The Soviet Union's opposition is also focused on the time factor.

### Pravda Comments on the Moscow Conference: Expresses Optimism About the Future

### British Communist Party Advocates Reorganizing the Labour Government

[United Press, London, 22nd] British Communist Party Secretary-General Barrett said in his opening speech at the 19th National Congress of the Communist Party today that he advocated reorganizing the Labour government to cooperate closely with the Soviet Union and said that Britain does not need a coalition government, and the Labour Party can do this work.

[United Press, London, 23rd] The British Communist Party held a conference today and passed a motion at the closing session opposing the British King and Queen's tour to South Africa, believing that this move is tantamount to protecting Smith's government, and Smith is one of those who encroach on personal freedom and oppress non-Europeans. Another motion calls for Britain to withdraw from Greece.

The main task of the army in peacetime is to carry out training and make political preparations. The daily activities of the Red Army should complete its technical victory. In short, strong discipline based on vigorous morale and political education is the main condition for maintaining the combat effectiveness of the Soviet army.

### Snow Returns to London, Fuel Crisis Worsens

[London, Feb. 22nd dispatch from the Associated Press] The British government announced tonight: Snow has returned to London, threatening the British gas industry and potentially making it unsustainable. It has ordered gas companies to reduce gas consumption by 10 percent.

Forty coal ships are blocked by wind at ports along the northeast coast, and coal reserves at major gas plants have been reduced to dangerous levels. Long lines of coal trains are blocked by snow in the north and South Wales and cannot run, with snow depths reaching 14 inches in some places. The restoration of power to factories in the central region next Monday after the blackout will increase the industrial burden on gas plants. The situation will be extremely serious in the next 48 hours. The government has ordered gas companies to reduce coal use by 10 percent, effective for ten weeks, continuing until May 2nd. According to a report from an official of the British Mineworkers' Union, thousands of miners are willing to work extra hours on Sundays.

### British and American Occupation Authorities in Germany Arrest a Large Number of Nazis

[Report from this newspaper] San Francisco, Feb. 23rd broadcast: British and American authorities today arrested a large number of Nazis in their respective occupation zones in Germany, including ten who are notorious remnants of the Nazi party. It is said that in the past few months, these Nazis have been constantly active, with the aim of spreading Nazi propaganda and restoring political power. They have declared five goals: (1) to prevent the dismantling of German factories for reparations; (2) to release imprisoned Nazis; (3) to completely prevent German coal from being shipped out of Germany; (4) to halt the socialization of Germany's major industries; (5) to support the movement to return East Prussia and Silesia to Germany.

### Travelogue of the Soviet Occupation Zone in Germany

— Special translation by this newspaper's translation department

The author and a friend, accompanied by a Soviet guide, made a thousand-mile trip through German territory under Soviet control. We visited German people from all walks of life, including

politicians, industrial workers, teachers, housewives, farmers, newspaper editors, mayors, and pastors. We spoke with Soviet military government officials, propagandists, and soldiers.

Two Basic Questions

The author had two basic questions in mind: First, why do most Germans think that life under Soviet rule is chaotic and miserable? Second, what is the Soviet Union's basic policy in Germany?

The answer to the first question is not easy to obtain. The area we passed through from Berlin to Dresden seemed very peaceful and fertile. Every piece of land was cultivated. In the industrial areas that had not been bombed, the machines were running and the chimneys were smoking.

Food Supply Situation

What about the food situation? Try grabbing a German and asking him, and he will immediately pull out his ration card. Strangely enough, the food ration here is more generous than in other parts of Germany occupied by the Allies—the Germans seem as nonchalant about this benefit as our team.

However, the people in the Soviet occupation zone not only do not show signs of being well-nourished, but instead appear haggard and hungry. While there are not many plump Germans in the American occupation zone, it is extremely difficult to find a German of acceptable weight here.

This is because in the Soviet occupation zone, the black market is almost completely non-existent. In the area under American control, anyone with money can get extra food from the black market, but in the Soviet occupation zone, people can only rely on what is rationed to them to make a living.

Why Do Germans Oppose the Soviets

The travelers, seeing the orderly situation here, seem to find the anti-Soviet sentiment of most Germans somewhat strange and unreasonable. Is it because of the Red Army's brutal behavior? The Germans I spoke with—including two old friends of the author, who certainly would not lie to me—unanimously admitted that the behavior of the Soviet occupation army was quite satisfactory.

Could it be that the Germans are long afraid of the Soviet measures to eliminate Nazi forces? In fact, the policies adopted by the Soviet Union in this regard are not as severe as those adopted by the American authorities. In the American occupation zone, all Nazi party members are barred from holding important positions. But in the Soviet occupation zone, all former Nazi party members, except for a few high officials, can easily have their identities forgotten as long as they mingle with the Soviets.

Despite all these facts, the Germans still hate the Soviets, perhaps due to the influence of the propaganda of German Propaganda Minister Goebbels. Germans now living in the British and American occupation zones, who used to be accustomed to the propaganda that "the Russians are demons who kill without blinking an eye," think that living in the Soviet zone is a very terrible thing.

Conversely, in the minds of most Germans, the British and Americans are seen as kind, extravagant, and somewhat comical figures. Therefore, the Germans living in the Soviet occupation zone envy their compatriots living in the British and American zones, thinking that they are living affluent and leisurely lives.

The Soviets themselves cannot be excused from the creation of these many misunderstandings and misinterpretations. Even if they have nothing to hide, they often deliberately act mysteriously, causing suspicion. Now this suspicious gaze is focused on the Soviet Union's favorite, the Socialist Unity Party—a political party formed by the merger of the German Social Democratic Party and the Communist Party.

Soviet Cultural Activities

Soviet policy is particularly evident in cultural activities. The Soviet authorities strive to preside over and encourage the cultural life of the Germans in the occupation zone—that culture is not "proletarian" literature and art, but German liberal culture.

In the many public schools we visited, we could not find any traces of Marxism. According to Professor Zock, the president of the University of Jena, the Soviet authorities gave him all kinds of assistance but did not interfere with his plans.

Even though the Soviets are full of anti-German sentiment, their apparent concern for German political and cultural issues seems, while not surprising, somewhat difficult to understand for people in Western countries. What exactly is their intention? Is there any truth to the recent rumors that the Soviet Union and Germany will form an alliance to control Europe?

Soviet Attitude Towards Germany

Outsiders of course have no way of knowing the Soviet Union's plans. But no matter what the plan is, the current fear of a Soviet-German bloc seems very far-fetched. The Soviet Union is currently apparently working hard to strengthen the strength of the German left wing, but it does not regard the German Communist Party as "comrades" or "allies," but only as assistants to the occupation authorities in handling administrative affairs.

The general German view is: Rather than fight side by side with the Soviet Union, it would be better to help the British and Americans destroy the Soviet Union. Therefore, the general Soviet view of uniting with Germany to declare war on the United States must be dismissed with a smile. Because although the Soviets hate the Germans, they do not dislike the Americans, and at the same time seem not to care much about the anti-Soviet sentiment in the United States.

The Germans think that war will break out sooner or later between the United States and the Soviet Union, so the Germans are surprised to see the Americans and Soviets getting along so well. But the Americans living in Germany think that the Germans' view is ridiculous. They feel that: Leaving politics aside, there is no hatred between Americans and Soviets, so why should they have animosity or fight each other?

Germany has suffered the ravages of war and the destruction of the area, all thanks to Hitler's long-term strategy of madness

### Using Loans to Buy Gold: Four United General Office Uncovers Three Companies; General and Deputy Managers of Zhengtai, Da Zhonghua, and Shenghua Factories Summoned by Military Law Department of the Garrison Command

Three companies, Zhengtai Rubber Factory, Da Zhonghua Paper Mill, and Shenghua Pharmaceutical Factory, have been found to be engaged in gold speculation using production loans. After being investigated by the Four United General Office, they were handed over to the Garrison Command by the supervisory committee for handling. The military law department of the Garrison Command summoned the general manager and deputy manager of each factory at 2 p.m. the day before yesterday and will transfer them to the court for handling within days. The three factories used part of their production loans to purchase gold, which is clearly contrary to the original intention of production loans. However, it was found that the three factories purchased a total of 140 gold bars, which is only a "fly" in the entire financial turmoil.

[Report from this newspaper] Although yesterday was a Sunday holiday, the Economic Supervision Group continued to thoroughly investigate the gold rush. It is reported that more than 30 major players who bought and sold gold during the gold rush have been uncovered by the supervision group using the method of peeling cocoons and extracting silk, checking the accounts of banks and money houses. Among them are gauze companies, private banks, and individuals. Although they may not all be the instigators of speculation and manipulation, their buying and selling without physical gold is illegal. The most important point is that the supervision group has apparently discovered traces of collusion between officials and businessmen. These figures who collude and work together for evil are also the real "tigers," and the supervision group is determined to "fight the tigers." Therefore, it has secretly submitted a report to Chairman Chiang. The Economic Supervision Group cannot announce anything until it receives approval.

### Summoning Manager of Tongfengyu Gold Shop to Inquire About Allotment Process

It is also learned that 60 to 70 percent of the gold released by the Central Bank after February 1st was allocated by Tongfengyu Gold Shop. Yesterday, Supervisory Committee member He Hanwen, accompanied by Yu Chao, leader of the Economic Supervision Group, and Xu Youzuo, questioned Zhan Liansheng, manager of Tongfengyu Gold Shop, at the Orient Hotel supervisory committee residence, inquiring in detail about the allotment process.

### Social Affairs Bureau Seeks to Stabilize People's Livelihood by Forming Price Review Council; Once Assessed, Shops May Not Change Prices Without Authorization

In order to stabilize prices and stabilize people's livelihood, the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau has now decided to establish a "Price Review Council" in accordance with the economic emergency measures plan and instructions issued by the central government. The organization of the Review Council will consist of one chief secretary and seven to eleven members. The position of chief secretary will be concurrently held by Director Wu Kaixian, and the candidates for each member will be selected by the council, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Industrial Association, the Garrison Command, the Police Bureau, and various industrial and commercial guilds, and will be hired by the Social Affairs Bureau. The powers of the council are to review the selling prices of essential daily necessities for the people's livelihood. The review method is to calculate the cost of the goods, including manufacturing costs or the original purchase price, as well as interest (not exceeding the loan interest rate agreed upon by the local banking industry), taxes, transportation costs, warehouse rent, management fees, insurance, and other expenses. Appropriate legal profits will be added separately. Once the prices of various goods are agreed upon, each shop must mark the assessed selling price. Before the Price Review Council re-evaluates the prices, they may not exceed the limit without authorization. The council is currently actively preparing and is expected to be formally established in early March.

### Train Tickets to Increase in Price Starting Next Month

It is reported that railway passenger and freight rates will increase on March 1st, with the increase multiplier being 50 to 100 percent.

It is also reported that the Railway Bureau will adjust the baggage fee for passengers starting tomorrow. The fee for the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines will be 6,000 yuan per ticket, and the fee for the Songhu line will be 3,000 yuan per ticket. The fee for live baggage carried by passengers will be 30,000 yuan per ticket.

### Public Utilities in This City Request Price Adjustments

Many public utilities have recently requested price increases from the Public Utilities Bureau, citing increased costs and inability to maintain operations. Public buses and trams (trolleys and trolleybuses) of British and French companies in this city will all increase in price starting next month. It is said that the multiplier will be 100 percent of the original fare, with public buses costing 400 to 1,400 yuan and trams costing 400 to 1,000 yuan. It is also said that the Public Utilities Bureau has already agreed in principle. As for other common fees such as water, telephone, and gas, they are also under negotiation with the Public Utilities Bureau, and prices will be adjusted soon. According to the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company, the company will also adjust electricity prices starting next month.

### Import Restrictions on Newspapers Too Strict: Newspaper Industry Urgently Appeals, Demanding Relaxation of Quotas, Sending Representatives to Petition Minister Peng

The government has announced the total quota for imported paper goods, and has also specified import quotas for various types of paper. Among them, the newspaper quota is very low. If paper is imported according to the specified quota and used to supply the national newspaper and publishing industries, it will be far from sufficient. Not only will the national publishing industry be affected, but the entire culture will be on the verge of collapse. The newspaper industry in this city feels that the situation is serious. Therefore, the Newspaper Industry Association convened a meeting a few days ago and decided to send representatives to Beijing to make an urgent appeal to the Ministry of Propaganda. They were scheduled to go to Beijing by the morning train today. Yesterday, Minister Peng of the Central Propaganda Department came to Shanghai.

They earnestly requested Mr. Peng to immediately consult with the Executive Yuan to relax the national newspaper import quota so that the newspaper industry could continue to survive. At the same time, they also hoped that the government would investigate the paper merchants' import situation, prevent hoarding and speculation, and investigate the Russian paper that was recently imported without settlement of foreign exchange, so that each newspaper could purchase it at a fair price. Mr. Peng promised to immediately transfer the matter to the Ministry of Finance and other relevant agencies for review and resolution to provide relief.

### The Xujiahui Observatory, with 75 Years of History

[Special Report] The Xujiahui Observatory is the earliest place in China to study astronomy and meteorology, and it is also the origin of modern science in China. As early as more than 300 years ago, Xu Guangqi of the late Ming Dynasty had close contacts with Matteo Ricci and Tang Ruowang, introducing Western astronomy and calendar calculations to China, at Xujiahui. At that time, Xujiahui was just a small village.

Main Work

The Xujiahui Observatory was founded in the eleventh year of Tongzhi of the Qing Dynasty (1872) and has been in existence for 75 years. At that time, Shanghai was opened as a port and the city was prosperous. The number of ships entering and leaving was increasing day by day. Hurricanes often caused disasters, resulting in tragic deaths. At that time, the Shanghai International Chamber of Commerce requested Father Dechevrens of the Catholic Church to set up an observatory to forecast the weather. The priest agreed, but on the condition that the telegraph bureau send telegrams free of charge. After the approval of the telegraph administration, the new-style observatory in the Far East was born at that time.

Weather forecasting is the main work of the Xujiahui Observatory and has made great contributions to the maritime community. In the past six or seventy years, countless hurricanes have occurred along the coast every year. The observatory's warning work has saved countless ships from disaster. They regularly connect with more than 50 other weather stations and observatories and report the weather records detected every day in four resolutions. At the same time, more than 200 weather reports are received from various places every day, and merchant ships and warships in the ocean also communicate with each other at any time. When a hurricane blows close to Shanghai, the observatory sends priests to wait on the signal tower on the outer beach to answer the inquiries of the captains. When the hurricane arrives in port, it issues a warning that can be heard very clearly on the Bund.

Research on Geomagnetism and Earthquakes

The Xujiahui Observatory is also engaged in the study of geomagnetism and earthquakes. The records of geomagnetic changes over the past six or seventy years are all preserved there. In the 30th year of Guangxu, Shanghai began to run trams, and geomagnetic research was greatly hindered. Therefore, it was moved to Lujiabang in Kunshan County. There are sophisticated instruments and skilled workers there. In the 11th year of the Republic of China, the instruments and technicians used in the coastal geomagnetic survey jointly conducted by the government and Japanese scientists were all supplied by the Xujiahui Observatory. The Earthquake Department is still in Xujiahui, equipped with new instruments, such as the Vesic-style horizontal seismograph and the Galitzin-style vertical seismograph, which are very precise and occupy an important position in the world's earthquake community.

Standard Clock

The standard clock is also a department of the Xujiahui Observatory's work. There are two new-style chronometers installed in the basement, keeping a certain temperature and pressure. The daily error does not exceed one-hundredth of a second. At 12:00 noon and 9:00 PM, the standard time is broadcast by radio. At that time, the ships in the port can correct the time on their ships. The International Astronomical Association has designated three places as standard clock stations, and the Xujiahui Observatory is one of them. In addition to recording and reporting time, they also do research work, which started in the 15th year of the Republic of China.

Sheshan's Equipment

Real astronomical research work is carried out on Sheshan, 15 miles from Shanghai. There is an equatorial mount with a diameter of 40 cm, which is often used to observe celestial phenomena. In the past, sunspots were photographed from telescopes. With more than 10,000 photos, the positions of 14,000 stars were determined, and the phenomena of 1,200 constellations and the Jupiter's disturbance of the orbits of other planets were studied. Calculations are more than a hundred resolutions. Sheshan's astronomical equipment is very rich and exquisite, and the work results have been well-presented because of years of accumulation.

Patrol Work

In addition to the Xujiahui weather forecast, time, earthquake research, Sheshan astronomical observation, and Lujiabang geomagnetic experiment, the work of the Xujiahui Observatory also includes patrol work in various places. Several trips were made to the interior to survey and map 54 maps in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, determining the orientation of 50 cities. The lighthouses in various coastal areas are also often inspected to check the accuracy of the instruments.

Recently, in order to safeguard sovereignty, the government ordered the Xujiahui Observatory to stop weather forecasts and meteorological broadcasts. This 75-year-old meteorological work will bid farewell to the outside world. However, their work will not stop, but it will not be made public. Father Long Xiangquan, who originally presided over the Xujiahui Astronomical Meteorology Work, has long been hired by the Shanghai Meteorological Observatory. In the future, the Xujiahui Observatory will still assist the Shanghai Meteorological Observatory with its power.

### Ma Chao Visited the Garden to Appreciate Goldfish

[Our Dispatch] Minister of Agriculture and Industry Ma Chaojun arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday. The purpose of this trip was to investigate the agricultural and industrial enterprises in Shanghai and develop domestic agricultural and industrial issues. Yesterday afternoon, accompanied by Xi Guansheng and Lin Ruiai, a specialist from the Central Ministry of Agriculture and Industry, Ma Shaotang and others, he went to the Guanshengyuan Farm in Caohejing to visit. He was guided around the farm by fellow villagers Zheng Xingbo, Liu Ling, and Xi Zaijian, and entered "Fish Swimming in the Sky" to view famous goldfish varieties. Wu Jiren, the person in charge of the fish department, told him that he planned to transport a large number of goldfish to the United States this year for sale. Mr. Ma instructed that the names, varieties, crosses, and breeding methods of various goldfish should be written in detail, then translated into Western languages, and then shipped, because the people there are not yet familiar with Chinese goldfish. Mr. Ma also said: The government can also help this endeavor to succeed. Mr. Ma then visited the factory and praised the various facilities of the factory after its restoration. Mr. Ma also told reporters that he would stay in Shanghai for three or four more days.

### High Court Detention Center: Like a Large Apartment, a Six-Story Building with Complete Facilities, All Undecided Traitors Enter

[Our Newspaper's Report] The site of the High Court Detention Center was originally a U.S. military tribunal. It was recently taken over by the High Court from the U.S. military, and thus established. The director is concurrently held by High Court Judge Chen Zhensheng. Underneath are one prison official, and three sections for General Affairs, Security, and Operations, as well as two offices for Medical Affairs and Education. Starting March 1st, 501 undecided traitor prisoners from the Loyal Supervision Center will be transferred to this facility for detention. The center is a massive six-story steel-concrete structure, towering in the northwest corner of Shanghai Prison, occupying a vast area. Inside, there are automatic elevators. The fifth floor has a rubber room, where all four walls are lined with thick rubber to prevent prisoners from committing suicide by hitting the walls and for detaining those with mental illnesses. The third floor has a gallows room, filled with a chilling atmosphere that sends shivers down one's spine. On the frame are three large ropes. During executions, the rope is placed around the prisoner's neck, the face is covered with black cloth, and the prisoner stands on a trapdoor. When the mechanism is triggered, the trapdoor falls, and the person is suspended in the air, dying instantly. The body falls to the lowest level and is transported out through a small door. The prison cells include single rooms and large rooms that can accommodate four or five prisoners. They are equipped with fixed bunks, flush toilets, and writing desks. A few rooms even have wardrobe facilities. The rooms have ample sunlight, and there are plenty of washrooms and bathrooms. At first glance, it resembles a well-equipped large apartment. Beside the center is a lawn where vegetables are grown, and it is also where the traitor Deng Weile Ni Hongzhi was executed. The center also has an Indian guard named Bar Sinsh, who can speak Shanghainese. It is said that he has worked in the prison for over thirty years. The building was constructed around 1931. However, whether foreign guards are needed for managing Chinese prisoners in the center is worth considering. Therefore, the issue of retaining this Indian person is still under investigation.

### Concerning Culture, Keep Hold of the End!

Wolf tails, produced in our country, are the main raw material for making writing brushes. Recently, due to fur exporters exporting wolf tails, which are not needed abroad, along with wolf skins, raw materials have become scarce. This forces us to repurchase them from foreign countries, causing the wolf tails exported from China to be re-imported. The repeated transfers waste time and increase prices, greatly affecting the development of our country's cultural enterprises. The Pen and Ink Trade Association of this city held a standing committee meeting yesterday and resolved: (1) to request fur exporters not to export wolf tails wastefully; (2) to request the government to prohibit the export of wolf tails; (3) to request people from all walks of life to advocate together to maintain culture.

### Ministry of Education Strictly Controls Self-Funded Study Abroad, Carefully Issues Passports

[Our Newspaper Nanjing 20th Dispatch] Since the Ministry of Education held public and private funded student abroad examinations last July, the number of Chinese students going to study in the United States, Britain, and other countries has increased significantly. However, there are rumors that many students who have not passed the examinations are still able to obtain passports and go abroad for study, leading to varying levels of competence and mixed quality. There has been some criticism from the outside. A reporter specifically visited a person in charge at the Ministry of Education regarding this matter, and received the following response: After the government's victory in the War of Resistance, it opened up the study abroad policy and held public and private funded study abroad examinations. Society has had two different opinions on this: one is that national rejuvenation and construction require urgent talent, so more students should be selected to go abroad for further study and cultivate talent, and the standards should be relaxed. The other is that students must have a solid foundation in their studies before going abroad to be able to achieve something, and that the standards should be strict in order to save national foreign exchange. Some even advocate that there should be no university graduation restrictions, and that self-funded study abroad examinations should not be held. Both of the above arguments have their own merits. However, it is an undeniable fact that China's post-war rejuvenation and construction requires people everywhere. Therefore, since the Ministry was approved to resume holding public and private funded study abroad examinations, it has raised the standards for admission and strictly selected candidates. Furthermore, in view of the fact that American universities have been extremely crowded with students since the post-war recovery, in order to avoid Chinese students wasting time and money abroad, it is stipulated that self-funded students who have passed the examination must obtain an admission certificate from a foreign university before being allowed to request the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to issue a passport. Since the implementation, the review has been very strict and has never been lenient. As for the rumors that there are people who have not obtained passports for going abroad in accordance with the Ministry's regulations, that is not related to the Ministry, because the Ministry is not the only department that can request the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to issue passports. The reporter also asked whether the government's recent suspension of issuing student passports was true. The person in charge replied that the Ministry handles public and private funded study abroad examinations in accordance with regulations, but if the Executive Yuan has new regulations, the Ministry will follow them after receiving orders.

### Summary of Shanghai City's Education Statistics for 1946

— Shi Chongpeng

Over the past year, education at all levels in Shanghai has shown a trend of rapid progress compared to before the War of Resistance and after the victory. The restoration of public schools has been gradually completed, private schools are also gradually developing, and literacy education is being promoted in stages. Considering the population changes in the city, the surge in the number of students is truly astonishing:

City Overview

Item Before the War (June 1937) After the Victory (December 1945) Now (December 1946) Percentage Increase Now Compared to Before the War Percentage Increase Now Compared to After the Victory

Number of Schools 1,227 1,208 1,378 Increase of 3.3 Increase of 14.1

Number of Students 243,744 250,454 425,162 Increase of 74.47 Increase of 69.75

Number of Social Education Institutions 1,378 194 270 Decrease of 80.4 Increase of 39.2

Number of Students and Participants 125,756 254,126 378,858 Decrease of 67.2 Increase of 49.1

The total number of schools increased by 14.1%, while the total number of students increased by 69.75%, which shows that Shanghai's education is becoming more economical. In particular, after most of the national schools implemented a two-shift system, the student capacity of each school greatly increased. The details of the increase in each level of school are shown in the table below.

In terms of the nature of all levels of schools in the city, public and municipal schools account for 23.3% (public schools other than municipal schools account for only 1.1%), private schools account for 76.7%, municipal education institutions account for 61.5%, and private institutions account for 38.5%, which shows that most of Shanghai's school education is still run by private individuals. This is a serious problem that needs to be solved urgently. However, in terms of the number of students in public and private schools, the percentage they occupy is slightly better than the former, which also shows that public and municipal schools are larger in scale and have more capacity, while many private schools are poorly equipped and have small school buildings.

(2) Situation of Primary Education

There are 1,116 primary schools in the city, with 317,762 students. The increase before the war, after the victory, and now is as follows:

Item Before the War (June 1937) After the Victory (December 1945) Now (December 1946) Percentage Increase Now Compared to Before the War Percentage Increase Now Compared to After the Victory

Number of Schools 1,040 935 1,116 Increase of 7.3 Increase of 19.3

Number of Students 188,177 175,874 317,762 Increase of 68.8 Increase of 80.7

The number of students increased from 188,177 to 317,762, an increase of more than 68%. What is particularly noteworthy is that the number of students in municipal and private schools has become more balanced. Based on the capacity of municipal elementary schools, if the number of existing municipal schools could be doubled, the goal of having the government completely run national education could be achieved.

Item Number of Schools Percentage Number of Students Percentage

Public 2 0.1 939 0.3

Municipal 282 25.3 137,939 43.4

Private 832 74.6 178,884 56.3

Total 1,116 100.0 317,762 100.0

According to the population statistics of the Civil Affairs Bureau in October 1946, the number of school-age children (6 to 12 years old) in the city is 425,995. The number of children in school already accounts for more than 72.8%, and there are still 108,243 children who have not enrolled. Observing the trend of the increase in the number of primary school students in Shanghai in one year, these more than 108,000 out-of-school children can all enroll in another year and six months. Assuming that each class has 50 people, then 2,165 classes need to be added to enable all school-age children to enroll.

(3) Situation of Secondary Education

Regarding secondary education, there are 223 secondary schools in the city, with 79,279 students. The increase or decrease before the war, after the victory, and now is as follows:

Item Before the War After the Victory Now Percentage Increase Now Compared to Before the War Percentage Increase Now Compared to After the Victory

Number of Schools 153 241 223 Increase of 45.8 Decrease of 9.5

Number of Students 43,666 59,842 79,279 Increase of 81.6 Increase of 24.5

During the occupation period, many secondary schools were established, and the number of schools suddenly increased. After the Education Bureau reorganized them after the victory, they decreased slightly. As of now, the number of schools has increased by 45.8% compared to before the war, and the number of students has increased by 81.6% compared to before the war. Further investigating from the perspective of public and private schools, the percentage of municipal middle schools, regardless of the number of schools or students, is far lower than that of municipal elementary schools.

Item Number of Schools Percentage Number of Students Percentage

Public 3 1.4 2,238 2.9

Municipal 11 9.4 11,284 14.2

Private 209 89.2 65,757 82.9

Total 223 100.0 79,279 100.0

(4) Situation of Higher Education

The number of schools above the junior college level has increased significantly in this year, because most of the national schools in Shanghai have completed their restoration. As of December 1946, there are 39 schools above the junior college level in the city, with 28,121 students. According to the population statistics of the Civil Affairs Bureau, the number of people in the city receiving higher education is 70,267. Therefore, students receiving higher education in Shanghai should account for 40.1%. The increase or decrease before the war, after the victory, and now, as well as the comparison by ownership, are as follows:

Item Before the War After the Victory Now Percentage Increase Now Compared to Before the War Percentage Increase Now Compared to After the Victory

Number of Schools 34 32 39 Increase of 14.7 Increase of 21.9

Number of Students 11,901 14,756 28,131 Increase of 136.7 Increase of 91.9

Comparison by Ownership:

Item Number of Schools Percentage Number of Students Percentage

Public 10 25.6 11,719 41.7

Municipal 3 7.7 515 1.8

Private 26 66.7 15,887 56.5

Total 39 100.0 28,121 100.0

(5) Situation of Social Education

There are 271 social education institutions in Shanghai, of which school-type institutions account for 85.4% and general-type institutions account for 14.6%. There are 52,659 people studying in them, and 326,199 people participate in the activities of general social education institutions each month. The two items combined account for slightly less than one-tenth of the total population of the city. The comparison between public and private institutions is as follows:

Item Number of Institutions Percentage Number of Students and Participants Percentage

Municipal 166 61.5 340,180 89.7

Private 104 38.5 38,678 10.3

Total 270 100.0 378,858 100.0

### Confident of Winning the Group A Championship, Donghua Wins Seven Games Out of Seven, Defeats the Soviet Union 4-2, 15,000 Fans Packed Yiyuan Yesterday

[Our Newspaper's Report] Spring has arrived, the weather is sunny and warm, and the long-deserted Yiyuan was once again very lively yesterday. Fans jostled shoulder to shoulder, competing to watch Donghua defeat the Soviet Union. The Group A champions, with seven wins out of seven, resulted in a 4-2 victory, with Donghua leading 2-1 in the first half. Han Longhai showed his skills and scored three goals. According to statistics, there were more than 15,000 fans yesterday, the first major event since the New Year.

One Goal Each, a Tie

The match started at 2:45 PM, with Wu Shouheng as the referee and Le Xiurong and Chen Jixiang as the linesmen. The Soviet Union kicked off, but was immediately blocked back. Soon, they came back again, and Robert Stov made a pass in the middle, and Gao Luonuo on the left wing shot hard, and the Soviet Union broke the net first, only three minutes after the start of the game. Donghua counterattacked, and three minutes later, Han Longhai received a pass from Youliang and returned a goal, tying the score.

Donghua Takes the Lead

"Nephew" Chen Mingzhe shot hard, and the ball went astray. The Soviet Union's Jielinkov sent it far, and Robert Stov headed it, but it also went out obliquely. Soon, the Soviet Union attacked Donghua's goal, but fortunately Tan Fuzhen cleared the ball. Donghua's Li Yao made a solo effort, but failed. Sun Jinshun's shot was also caught by Bo Saweiqu. Until the 26th minute, Longhai went straight in, tricked Gutov, and kicked up, shooting low into the left corner. Donghua took the lead 2-1. The first half soon ended.

Another Tie, Two Goals Each

Changing sides and fighting again, breaking through the encirclement, the Soviet Union's military appearance was slightly adjusted, and Donghua was still the original team. The barbarian general worked together to counterattack. Within two minutes, Kapustin swept from the right side, and Bang Lun did not prevent this shot, and the ball窜窜 entered the net, resulting in a 2-2 tie. Donghua was unwilling and launched a large-scale attack. In the fifth minute, Youliang took a shot near the goal, but it was too weak and was caught by the Soviet goalkeeper.

Seven Wins Out of Seven

Before long, Longhai showed his superb skills and made a great contribution. Donghua regained the lead 3-2. In the 18th minute, Li Yao got the ball on the left corner and gently crossed it, and it broke the net, making it 4-2, securing the victory. After that, both sides had attacks and defenses, but none were successful. Until the end, Donghua defeated the Soviet Union 4-2, creating a great record of seven wins out of seven.

### Fragments from the Yiyuan

The Siberian cold wave has frozen the people of Shanghai stiff. Yesterday, the weather was surprisingly clear, with a gentle breeze and bright sunshine, perfect weather for playing and watching soccer. Inside the Yiyuan field, crowds of men and women watched Donghua win their seventh straight game, beaming with joy.

Basketball teams came to Shanghai, leaving the Shanghai basketball team in a state of defeat. The Municipal Gymnasium has become deserted. The Shanghai team has been away for two or three weeks for the inter-port soccer competition. The Shanghai soccer team has been torn apart and lacks vitality. Shanghai fans are itching for soccer. No wonder they rushed to be the first yesterday, as they have been estranged from this for a long time.

Donghua has won seven straight games and still has one game against the Soviet Union and two games against Youyou. It seems that the Group A championship is within reach.

Zhang Banglun, who is very popular in Hong Kong and praised by the "King of Soccer," did not have the opportunity to perform as goalkeeper yesterday, with only one good save.

Han Longhai scored three goals alone, stealing the spotlight. Sun Jinshun became lazy, and Jia Youliang also did not have any outstanding points.

The Soviet center, also the center of the Shanghai inter-port team, the little blond Robert Stov, was restrained by Donghua. Although under surveillance, he was still "good."

The Soviet left winger, Golonov, was well-received and received much attention. (English)

After switching sides, Renyu scored repeatedly, while the Railway team was at a loss. When time ran out, Renyu easily defeated the Beijing Railway team 50-22.

### The Gold Shop Industry General Assembly Passed Three Key Points for Saving the Industry; Requesting the Government to Revoke Restrictions and Allow the Sale of Gold Jewelry

[Our Newspaper] The Shanghai gold shop industry held an emergency general membership meeting at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce auditorium at 2:00 PM yesterday. Present were Feng Guangjia, a specialist from the Bureau of Social Affairs, Yan Esheng, a secretary from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, representatives from various gold shops in the city, and representatives from gold shops in Nanjing, Wuxi, Nantong, Kunshan, Shaoxing, and other places, totaling about 400 people. Yao Lianfang of Lao Qiutianbao Gold Shop served as chairman. After reporting the purpose of the meeting, Yao Lianfang, Yao Guiqing (Xin Qiutianbin), Chen Depeng (Wuhua), Zhang Jingle (Lao Baocheng), Qiu Yunliang (Lao Tianbao), Yu Yongsui (Baocheng), and Chen Ziqing (Xing Qiongqing) were elected as the seven-member presidium. Then, Feng Guangjia, a specialist from the Bureau of Social Affairs, gave a speech, stating that the purpose of the gold shop industry's general membership meeting was to discuss the business problems of the entire gold shop industry, and he hoped that the representatives could engage in research and discussion through legal procedures and steps. Then, Yan Esheng gave a speech, stating that the Municipal Chamber of Commerce expressed great sympathy for the situation of the gold shop industry and was willing to assist. According to general perception, the purchase of gold jewelry was originally a disguised form of savings. After the sale of gold jewelry was prohibited, the surplus funds of the general middle and lower classes would either be wasted or turned to the hoarding of daily necessities, which would cause price fluctuations and contradict the government's policies. At present, the government has no way to deal with those who hold gold bars and ingots, but it makes such regulations for gold shops that are engaged in legitimate business, which cannot be said to be fair. And whether changing gold jewelry to silver jewelry is feasible in the general habits of our country is also quite a problem. After Mr. Yan's speech, Yan Chunrong, chairman of the Nanjing Gold Shop Industry Association, gave a speech, meaning that the regulation on the 16th of this month prohibiting all gold transactions was tantamount to an indefinite sentence for the gold shop industry, and the regulation on the 21st that gold shops were only allowed to sell but not buy was tantamount to sentencing the gold shop industry to death. After Mr. Yan's speech, the discussion on organizing a committee to save the industry was held, and three points were passed: (1) Organize a temporary committee to save the industry. (2) Invite the committee to unite representatives from various places to carry out the work together. (3) Authorize the committee to handle the work of saving the industry under three major principles. The three principles are: (1) Request the government to revoke the regulations on time-limited registration, time-limited sales, and mandatory exchange for national currency. (2) Allow the gold shop industry to engage in the business of collecting, processing, and selling gold jewelry. (3) Request the government to allow the gold shop industry to apply to the Central Bank for allocation to meet demand. Then, the general assembly elected the members of the committee to save the industry. In addition to the seven members of the presidium as ex officio members, Ge Zhenxin (Yang Qinghe), Shen Zenglin (Fang Jiuling), Zhao Enbo (Lao Tianbin), Qiu Zhaonian (Shikang), and Wu Pengnian (Baocheng) were elected as members. The committee to save the industry was established on the same day to study ways to save the industry, and the meeting was adjourned at 4:00 PM.

[Another News] Representatives of the gold shop industry in Yangtai and Zhenjiang, northern Jiangsu, arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning. All the staff of the Ningbo industry also sent a telegram in response, and two representatives will arrive today or tomorrow. Director Deng of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Specialist Tang of the Ministry of Social Affairs are in Shanghai on official business, and the joint petition delegation of labor and management representatives of the gold shop industry plans to visit the Municipal Chamber of Commerce today to submit a petition.

The presidium elected by the General Assembly of the Gold Shop Industry.

### Japanese Silk Cocoon Transport to China Shows Promise of Success

[Our Newspaper] According to sources, regarding the negotiations on transporting Japanese silk cocoons to China, the Allied Headquarters' attitude towards this matter has changed recently due to the drop in silk prices in the US market, and the proposed price is also more reasonable. If negotiations continue, there is a good chance of success. According to qualified people who told reporters: The resurgence of Japan's silk industry in the future must take sweeping the Southeast Asian market as its development goal. China's silk industry must work together with the support of the government to protect the market in Southeast Asia. National silk has a unique dyeing property due to soil and water conditions, which is loved by people in Southeast Asia. We must maintain its advantages and make further improvements. If national silk can have a vast market in Southeast Asia, it does not matter even if we give up sales in other parts of the world.

### Large Quantities of Yarn and Cloth Transported to Guangdong

[Our Newspaper] The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Hanmin ship sailed from Shanghai to Guangzhou the day before yesterday. In addition to shipping more than 1,900 packages of raw peanuts, 1,300 pieces of bean cake, 800 packages of fertilizer powder, more than 450 packages of beans, and more than 3,500 pieces of general merchandise, there were also more than 1,140 pieces of cotton yarn and more than 1,040 pieces of piece goods. The yarn and cloth were all handled by merchants and were the first large shipment since the government banned the transport of yarn and cloth to Guangdong last October. It was previously reported that the ban on transporting yarn and cloth to the south would be lifted, but there has been no definite news. The Hakka community is eagerly awaiting the implementation of this measure as soon as possible.

### Central Bank to Issue 5,000 Yuan New Banknotes Today

[Our Newspaper] The Central Bank has recently decided to issue a new 5,000 yuan banknote starting today to meet actual needs and facilitate the settlement of large amounts of money. The new banknotes are printed by the Central Printing Factory and Daye Company. The designs and colors are excellent and are all intaglio prints. If needed, people can apply to the bank's issuing bureau for exchange.

### Securities News: Listing of Foreign Stocks Still Requires Some Time; No Plans to Auction Public Bonds

[Our Newspaper] Since the government promulgated the new economic plan and banned the trading of gold and foreign currency, market idle funds have tended to concentrate in the securities market. According to a related source: This is actually the most normal outlet for idle funds. In the future, state-owned production enterprises will be returned to private operation, and it will generally be nothing more than issuing shares. It is hoped that the securities market can fully exert its functions and achieve the goal of monetizing assets and securitizing funds.

Also, regarding the listing of foreign stocks, the reporter specially visited a responsible person from the Municipal Securities Exchange yesterday. According to him: The foreign companies concerned have repeatedly discussed the listing of foreign stocks with the stock exchange authorities. However, recently, the foreign companies are successively handling capital increases, so they must wait until they have completed the legal registration procedures with their home governments and then be approved by our country's competent authorities before their stocks can be traded on the market. Therefore, he believes that it will still take some time. As for the auction of public bonds, the stock exchange previously received an order from the Ministry of Finance to "postpone the auction," and there has been no change in the instruction. Therefore, it is unlikely that an auction will be held in the short term.

### China and Japan Should Delimit Fishing Zones

[Our Newspaper] It is reported that the relevant authorities have generally made a decision in principle on the future development of China's fishery. In terms of geographical structure, China's coastal areas are among the best fish-producing areas in the world, but there are not many large schools of fish. Therefore, in fact, Taiwan will be the main base for fishery and will develop towards the Southwest Pacific. However, due to environmental and equipment reasons, if Japan's fishery cannot be properly restricted, it will be difficult for China to compete with it for a while. And Japanese fishing boats may invade our territorial waters from time to time. Therefore, the relevant authorities will suggest delimiting the fishing zones of China and Japan in the Western Pacific at future international conferences.

### Import and Export Merchants' Association Decides to Reorganize

[Our Newspaper] There were only several hundred import and export merchants in the city when the association was established, but it has increased to 1,400 at present. Therefore, the association has decided to reorganize to make the internal organization more complete and sound. It is reported that the association will hold a general membership meeting on April 1 to discuss the reorganization. At present, the various small committees of the association have mostly suspended their business due to the association's decision to reorganize.

### United States Adopts Tough Policy to Interfere with Gold and Foreign Currency Speculation

[Reuters, New York, 22nd] According to people in the gold and silver industry here: The Chinese government's recent explicit ban on the free trading of gold and US dollars may have been caused by US interference. The US government is now adopting a stronger policy against domestic and foreign actions that support funding and speculation in US dollars. People in the gold and silver industry believe that foreign governments have received private information that the US government is planning to strictly interfere with gold and US dollars. It is speculated that Mexico's cessation of gold exports was at least hinted at by Washington, and other Latin American governments have probably also received this hint.

[Reuters, Washington, 2nd] The US Department of Commerce recently released a report stating that exports of gold bars in January totaled 2,917,000 ounces (compared to 3,302,000 ounces in December of last year and 3,000,000 ounces in January of last year). Imports of gold bars in January totaled 2,379,000 ounces (compared to 1,446,000 ounces in December of last year and none in January of last year). Exports of silver in the above three periods were 2,741,000 ounces, 6,901,000 ounces, and 28,785,000 ounces, respectively. Imports of silver were 7,451,000 ounces, 4,010,000 ounces, and 909,000 ounces, respectively. US monetary gold increased by 219,489,000 yuan in January to become 20,749,000,000 yuan. Gold reserves in the Federal Reserve Bank decreased by 3,632,000,000 yuan from 196,000,000 yuan to 3,632,000,000 yuan.

### Flour Mills Request Adjustment of Rationing Prices

The rationing of flour in the city is suffering because flour mills are short on raw materials. It has been agreed that the authorities will be responsible for half a month first to fill the gap. At the same time, the factories will borrow money to purchase wheat for milling and supply. The purchased wheat will start to be milled and supplied this week. Therefore, Fuxin and the other five factories will also start to take over the supply of rationing flour today. The price will remain at 30,000 yuan per bag. However, according to flour mills, the industry has submitted a request to the authorities to adjust the rationing price, because the purchase price of wheat is more than 70,000 yuan per dan, so the cost of flour is more than 50,000 yuan per bag. It is said that this matter will be decided at the beginning of next month.

### Flannel Sales Are Brisk

Flannel sales were quite brisk yesterday. Local customers are continuing to purchase. Medium gray colors are especially active. Incoming herringbone cloth is selling for 140,000 to 150,000 yuan per yard, and plain cloth is selling for 95,000 to 100,500 yuan. Local factory goods, such as Zhongfang, Zhanghua, and Zhenfeng brands, are mostly selling for more than 60,000 yuan and up to 80,000 yuan. Spring tweed that is slightly presentable is mostly selling for 150,000 to 160,000 yuan per yard. Summer tweed merchants are shouting high prices without any standard due to source and environmental factors.

### French Imports of Chinese Silk

12,000 Kilograms in January

[Reuters, Paris, 22nd] In January of this year, France imported a total of 28,400 kilograms of silk cocoons, valued at 13,153,000 francs, compared to 24,600 kilograms in December of last year, valued at 9,399,000 francs. All of the silk cocoons imported in January were exported from Italy, while most of the silk cocoons in December were exported from Persia. In addition, France exported 55,900 kilograms of silk in January, of which 19,200 kilograms were exported from Japan and 21,000 kilograms were exported from China.

### England Plans to Promote International Wool Trade

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 23rd] In order to study and exchange information and to promote closer ties in wool trade between countries around the world, the British government is initiating the establishment of an international wool research group and is inquiring with the governments invited to attend this year's international wool conference about their opinions on the establishment of the group. Our government has also received the above notice, and it is said that the Ministries of Economic Affairs and Agriculture are jointly discussing policy.

### Northeast National Goods Exhibition: Manufacturers Can Apply; State Banks and Bureaus Export Documentary Credit: Total Amount is 500 Million Northeast Circulation Vouchers

The Northeast Economic Commission has scheduled to hold a Northeast National Goods Mobile Exhibition in April of this year and is seeking participation from national goods manufacturers within the customs. The Four Joint Offices has specially approved the method for state banks and bureaus to provide export documentary credit for national goods participating in the exhibition. It is reported that manufacturers who wish to participate in the exhibition of national goods can apply to the China, Communications, Farmers, and China Trust Banks for export documentary credit. The total amount of export documentary credit is 500 million Northeast circulation vouchers, with a limit of 20 million circulation vouchers per household. Converted to national currency, the goods will be mortgaged at 70% of the Shanghai market price for a term of 30 days. The interest rate will be negotiated and reported by the handling banks. The documentary credit procedure will be for the representative bank to issue a credit purchase certificate to the Northeast Mobile National Goods Exhibition of the Economic Commission, which will be sent to the Shanghai China National Goods Joint Operation Company for delivery to the manufacturers participating in the exhibition. The manufacturers will sign drafts within the limit per household and submit them to Shanghai for payment. The method of repayment is that after the mortgaged goods arrive in Shenyang, they will be changed to cash mortgage. During the exhibition period, the proceeds will be collected by personnel sent by the bank. Goods that have not been repaid will be purchased by the Materials Adjustment Committee.

### Accomplices and Masterminds of the Wanbaoshan Incident: A Porter's Rise – The Antiquarian – A Red Figure in the Northeast Sixteen Years Ago – "Second Master" Hao in Jilin Prison

— Changchun, 12th (Airmail Dispatch) – Our Correspondent in Shenyang, Zhao Zhan

In the desolate Changchun, a stirring news event is rare. The case of Hao Yongde, the mastermind behind the Wanbaoshan Incident, being publicly tried for the first time on the 19th, not only caused a sensation in Changchun but also drew the attention of people across the nation.

This event, shimmering in the painful history of Sino-Japanese relations, has become a stain on the Chinese nation. It was the fuse for the anti-Chinese movement in Korea sixteen years ago, a prelude to the September 18th Incident, and a buried spark of the Second World War in the Northeast.

Yesterday, the reporter visited Hao Yongde, the mastermind of the Wanbaoshan Incident, at Jilin First Prison. With the warden's permission, he was brought from his cell to the warden's office. Hao Yongde wore heavy shackles but moved without much difficulty, bowing deeply to us from afar. He is tall and sturdy, with a slightly hunched back, a long face, a broad forehead, and a three-inch-long, grizzled beard. At seventy-three years old, his eyes still gleam brightly, and his spirit is excellent. He was dressed in a blue cotton-padded jacket and trousers, without a cotton-padded waistcoat, showing no signs of being afraid of the cold. The warden invited him to sit down and introduced him to the reporter. He stood up again and bowed.

A Rude Awakening – A Slightly Embarrassing Situation

Sixteen years after the Wanbaoshan Incident, the major details had faded in his memory. After being questioned by the reporter, he seemed to have been rudely awakened, appearing somewhat embarrassed. He paused for a moment and said, "I am illiterate, a farmer. That year, regarding the land cultivation, I went back home and was allowed to cultivate the land. The then County Magistrate Ma and the police chief both approved it. So, I gathered people from the village to cultivate the land. When we got there, they wouldn't allow us to cultivate it, so we didn't. The county government sentenced me to six months in prison. We are farmers; we don't know anything. Later, they said a war had started, but there was no war, and there were no Koreans. I am illiterate and would never collude with the Japanese. Who would harm our country...?"

Such a sensational and bloody incident was dismissed by him as if it were nothing significant, while he pretended to be unaware of the following facts.

Major Bloodshed – Casually Dismissed

The facts are: In the spring of the 20th year of the Republic (1931), the Jilin Provincial Government permitted a small number of Korean immigrants to enter the country to cultivate rice. He was incited by the deceased local strongman Zhang Yantang (also known as Zhang Hongbin) and Xiao Yuchun (Xiao Zengxiu) of Wanbaoshan Village, Changchun County. He used three thousand silver dollars and two gold bracelets to bribe County Magistrate Ma Zhongyuan (still alive). At his behest, he colluded with Korean individuals such as Shen Yunze to organize the Changnong Rice Field Company, using the Mainland Business Association of the Korean Residents' Association on Qima Road, Changchun, as the company's address. He also colluded with the local district chief, Cao Yanshi, as the guarantor, leasing over five hundred qing (one qing equals ten mu) of uncultivated and cultivated land near Majiashao and Guanhua Village owned by Zhang Yantang and twelve other households to the Changnong Rice Field Company. A lease was signed on April 16th of the same year, with a term of ten years, violating the spirit of the Gando Convention between Japan and China on September 4, 1909, which "prohibited Koreans from residing and leasing land." He then subleased the aforementioned five hundred qing of uncultivated and cultivated land to Koreans for rice cultivation. However, rice cultivation required water from the Yitong River, and the distance between the land and the Yitong River was over twenty li. They entrusted Zou Chunyao and others to dredge and lease land, but they did not obtain the permission of the local landowners. With the aim of obtaining the right to draw water from the intermediate land and developing their rice fields for illegal profits, they used the county government's illegal permission and the influence of the Japanese and Koreans, considering the land between their fields and the Yitong River as the natural site for a canal. Disregarding the permission of the landowners of the intermediate land, such as Sun Yongqing, they openly gathered 188 unregistered Korean residents to live there. On May 1st of the same year, they forcibly dug the canal, leading to opposition from the landowners whose land was being dug, such as Sun Yongqing, who appealed to Chinese officials to expel them. At this time, the Japanese revealed their true colors. On June 4th of the same year, the Japanese Consulate in Taonan dispatched police, armed with guns, to protect the Korean residents. The Japanese continued to send police, and our people, unable to reason effectively, gathered on July 1st to fill in the canal. The police officers dispatched by the Japanese consulate opened fire on our people, although no one was injured. Our people had no choice but to retreat.

Digging Canals, Sawing Trees, Building Dams, Planting Rice

At the same time, the Japanese expanded their propaganda, leading to a major anti-Chinese incident in the border region of Korea. As a result, the Korean residents of Wanbaoshan Majiashao, under the protection of Japanese police with guns, continued to dig canals, saw trees, and build dams, preventing the landowners from resisting. They planned a canal about twenty li long, nine feet wide, and seven feet deep, using the excavated soil to occupy nine feet of the people's fields on both sides, occupying a total of over twenty-nine households, including the victim Xi Shuiqing. They took over twenty qing and one mu of fertile land and thirteen qing and seven fen of wasteland for canal construction. They also felled willows belonging to the victims, such as Sun Yongqing, covering an area of several zhang. Because of the damming of the river, over a hundred qing of fertile land and over twenty qing of planted rice fields were flooded. The issue remained unresolved until September of the same year.

Son Studying in Japan, Eldest Daughter Married to a Japanese

The reporter knew that he wouldn't reveal the truth about the events of that year if asked directly, so he shifted the topic to his family background. He said he was from Tianjin and had been in the Northeast for fifty-three years. He started as a porter and has one son and two daughters. His son studied at the "Imperial University" in Japan, and his eldest daughter is married to a Japanese. Someone told the reporter in private that he used to run a brothel. His daughters are not his biological children but two beautiful prostitutes. He first used a "beauty trap" to collude with the Japanese.

Antique Collection – All Confiscated

He rose from a porter to amass a fortune!

The reporter then asked about the valuable antiques confiscated by the authorities. Where did they come from? He replied that he had always liked antiques and porcelain since he was young, and he bought them over time. He also said that after Japan's surrender, the Communists arrested him twice: once in Shuangchengpu and once in Harbin, demanding money. He didn't give them a single copper plate. He said he really had no money.

This famous "Second Master Hao" of the puppet Manchukuo era was originally a rogue from the lower rungs of Chinese society. He lived on Qima Road in Changchun, near where the Koreans lived. He was an ardent believer in ghosts and spirits, and the Japanese also valued him. At a time when Japan was plotting to invade China, and the Koreans were taking advantage of the chaos, the Chinese were suffering. "Second Master Hao" aided the enemy, harmed his compatriots, and was considered a major culprit in attracting foreign disasters. No one would say "no."

### Singapore's Surging Labor Strikes: Japanese Prisoners of War Become Treasures

— Singapore, 2nd (Airmail Dispatch) – Our Traveling Correspondent in Nanyang, Qiu Ai

Singapore, the premier naval port of the Far East and the largest port in Nanyang, now has blocked drains, stagnant water, and a stench in the air. Starting from February 1st, anyone relying on public transportation, except for private matters, will have to walk. The number of trains on the Malayan Peninsula is decreasing daily, and night trains have already been suspended. Astute readers, upon reaching this point, will undoubtedly realize that Singapore is being strangled by labor unrest and cannot even breathe.

Seven Departments of the Municipal Council

Last December, five Chinese laborers from the Municipal Council submitted a petition to the chairman, requesting a response within two weeks (i.e., before January 10th). Otherwise, relevant labor unions would take appropriate action. The workers presented twenty demands, the main ones being: ordinary laborers should receive double their current salary; salaries should be paid for Sundays and holidays, and work on Sundays should be paid at double the rate; back pay should be given for the three and a half years of the occupation period; any laborer who resigns or is dismissed by the Municipal Council should be given a generous severance payment based on their length of service; suitable housing with water and electricity should be provided to laborers as soon as possible, with two single people sharing a room and each family occupying two rooms; and any laborer without housing provided should receive a monthly allowance of ten dollars.

On January 8th, the chairman responded to the petition, stating that the representatives were impolite. He suggested that the petitioners should register or join a formal labor union and offered to discuss the matter with any labor union representing the interests of workers in various departments that the Municipal Council members deemed satisfactory. Only after such discussions would the Municipal Council give them a detailed response.

On the 13th, the interim secretary of the labor unions sent a letter to the Municipal Council, stating that the labor unions were prepared to jointly discuss the workers' grievances to reach a mutual understanding and did not intend to threaten or be disrespectful. They expressed joy at the chairman's willingness to discuss their plight.

The next day, the chairman of the Municipal Council replied, reminding the workers that only one Chinese worker had appeared when the original petition was submitted on December 28th, and no Chinese representatives were present when he was visited on January 11th. He added that if the labor unions could guarantee that they were properly formed and their registration applications were under consideration by the Registrar of Trade Unions, he and the city councilors could give a detailed response to their twenty demands. However, the matter still required careful study, and he could not provide an immediate answer.

On the 19th, Nafu, in his capacity as the permanent secretary of the seven labor unions of the Municipal Council, sent a letter to the Municipal Council, accusing the council chairman of using diplomatic evasions. He stated that extending the exchange of letters would be futile, so they were compelled to send a final communication, demanding a response before 5:00 PM on January, failing which the committee would implement a strike. During the strike, which would be conducted peacefully, the authorities were prohibited from using the following methods to undermine the strike: (1) employing Japanese prisoners of war to replace workers; (2) employing workers belonging to hostile labor unions; (3) canceling the strikers' rice rations; (4) reclaiming the workers' dormitories; (5) using the police to interfere with the workers' peaceful assembly; and (6) suspending salaries during the strike.

The strike has been ongoing for several days, and the two sides are deadlocked. A satisfactory resolution is likely to take considerable time.

Tram and Coal Mine Labor Strikes Follow

The strike by workers from seven departments of the Municipal Council has already given the Singapore administrative authorities a headache, but just as one wave subsides, another rises. A tram workers' strike is imminent. The workers have given the management two days to fully respond, failing which they will unanimously implement a strike.

The tram workers' strike has a more complex background. Tram workers are divided into three categories: (1) drivers; (2) ticket sellers; (3) inspectors. It was decided that a ticket seller was cheating and was beaten by an inspector. The ticket seller was dissatisfied and contacted the drivers to jointly file a complaint with the manager. The most important condition was that the inspector should apologize to the ticket seller. The manager, due to the company's organization and position, refused this request. The ticket sellers and drivers harbored resentment, so after the recent labor negotiations broke down, they decided that the management must fully accept the workers' fifteen conditions, failing which they would implement a strike.

While the labor unrest in Singapore remains unresolved, a coal mine strike has erupted in Malaya. According to reliable sources in Kuala Lumpur, Malaya has only enough coal to last for ten days. Unless the Malaya Coal Company resumes production of a significant amount of coal by February 8th, various public services, such as electricity and trains, will be completely suspended.

The Federated Malay States Mining Association has requested that the government promptly import coal and take effective steps to restore coal production. The mining sector is deeply concerned about the government's strict restrictions on electricity use due to the coal shortage, which will affect the tin mines that have previously received government loans to facilitate their early recovery.

Employing Japanese Prisoners of War

Since the strike began, workers have been asking people everywhere to donate living expenses and demanding that the police not interfere, which has been achieved. However, the government is using a new tactic, employing Japanese prisoners of war to replace the workers. Currently, the cleaning and sanitation work in the Singapore city center is being done entirely by Japanese prisoners of war. The Japanese prisoners of war are naked from the waist up, some wearing sanitary masks over their noses. They are very cooperative in taking out the trash for people. When someone gives them a cigarette or two, they are endlessly grateful, repeatedly saying "Arigato." As for Kuala Lumpur, over two hundred Japanese prisoners of war have recently been transferred to work at the coal mines. This number will gradually increase in the coming days. The government has decided to hire foreign labor to maintain coal production.

A Crisis Ahead – Resolve It Early

In all fairness, the world has been turbulent since the end of World War II. The Far East is in chaos, and Europe is also in chaos. China is not at peace, and neither is Nanyang. Over the past seventeen months, the Singapore government has devoted its full efforts to stabilizing the financial situation, implementing rationing, and suppressing the black market, causing prices to fall daily. This effort is commendable. However, current prices in Singapore are at least two to three times higher, or even five to six times higher, than before the war. Workers' salaries have not increased proportionately. They are suffering, filled with grievances, and once stirred up, the labor unrest will be unstoppable. At the end of last year, over two hundred stores in Singapore closed—breaking a record—and business is now very slow. It will likely be difficult for the Singapore government to remain unaffected.

As for employing Japanese prisoners of war to replace workers, this is a temporary measure. The Singapore government should not consider this method appropriate. If the labor unrest cannot be resolved quickly, workers, driven by the need for food and clothing, may resort to desperate measures. The danger is unimaginable.

### Taiwan's Highways: Absorbing Mainland Tourists, Revealing Swiss Atmosphere

— Taipei, 8th Dispatch via Airmail · Special Correspondent Jiang Muyun for This Newspaper

Every visitor from across the sea to Taiwan feels that the transportation is both convenient and comfortable. Especially the highways. Sitting in spacious seats, gazing at the island's scenery, there's none of the cramped feeling of riding a tram in Shanghai. Taiwan, after all, still maintains its tranquility and peace.

The Chairman and his wife visited Taiwan last year. On the high-quality road to Keelung, eight new-style public buses sped past in forty minutes. He nodded frequently, witnessing the accelerated progress of transportation after the takeover, and expressed his satisfaction.

Keelung-Taipei Line: A Bus Every Ten Minutes

Those who haven't been to Taiwan would never imagine that the island possesses such an extensive transportation network. From Keelung to Taipei, the main passenger transport relies entirely on highways. From morning till night, every ten minutes a vehicle capable of accommodating thirty-two people departs, truly a transportation artery from the port to the provincial capital. On the wide, glossy cement road, passengers are carried back and forth at a speed of seventy kilometers per hour.

Keelung has been designated as a transshipment port for South China. Without "water rats," shipments are fast, warehouses are plentiful, and freight is cheap. American freight will use this as a base to distribute goods to Hong Kong and Guangzhou. The importance attached to Keelung indicates the near-term prosperity of Taiwan Province. This 29.8-kilometer route will not decline; it will only flourish!

Mileage in Operation: Over One Thousand Kilometers

The reporter remembers that at the beginning of the restoration, only 249 kilometers of highways were open to traffic throughout the province, with a monthly mileage of 60,000 vehicle kilometers. Currently, the entire island's ring road, totaling over 1,000 kilometers, is open to traffic. The current mileage in operation reaches 1,115 kilometers, with an average daily mileage of 13,346.6 vehicle kilometers. This is unprecedented progress in highway transportation in this province.

In terms of transportation, Taiwan Province can be said to have a highway density far greater than any other province in the country. Besides rural roads, the main and branch lines that have been completed total over 5,000 kilometers. Calculating over the province's 36,000 square li, there is an average of slightly less than one kilometer per seven square li. This is Taiwan's excellent transportation foundation.

Building from Scratch: A Model of Construction

The Highway Bureau, established on August 1st of last year, faced immense difficulties because of the severe shortage of vehicles at the time of the takeover, the difficulty in finding sources, and the difficulty in repairing them. As a result, it finally borrowed money from the Bank of Taiwan and ordered 300 new vehicle chassis from the United States in batches. These were gradually assembled. Now there are 112 new and old vehicles operating throughout the island.

Director Hua Chousong told the reporter that this province has a dense highway network and a good foundation, but the Highway Bureau almost started from scratch. The government didn't provide a single penny, so they had to borrow from the bank. Now, they are repaying the loan monthly with the daily surplus, which is the convenience of a public enterprise. It is understood that another batch of thirty-eight new vehicles capable of accommodating forty-two people will arrive in March and be put into operation. This will be good news for travelers!

Female Ticket Sellers: Skimming Sent to Court

The various stations maintaining highway transportation employ a total of 693 people, including 121 drivers, all of whom have skilled techniques. The highest salary is a base salary of 100 yuan per month, a subsidy of 2,000 yuan, and a mileage wage of 2,200 yuan. The Highway Bureau employs female ticket sellers, all local Taiwanese girls. They earn 50 yuan per month (twenty times the previous amount), plus a subsidy and a labor bonus of 2,000 yuan.

Passenger transport can generate a daily income of 360,000 yuan. It is understood that the practice of skimming has also begun to spread to the island, but the Highway Bureau takes legal action against this petty theft. Several ticket sellers have already been sent to court for skimming ticket sales.

Island-Wide Traffic: Rich in Swiss Atmosphere

The Highway Bureau is now preparing to handle freight transport, mainly for short distances, to supplement the railways' shortcomings. In particular, the mainland needs 60,000 tons of coal every month, but the province's internal transportation is insufficient, only able to transport two-thirds of that amount. Currently, the province's freight transport is maintained by seven jointly operated public-private trucking companies, with 488 trucks, carrying local products such as timber, vegetables, and medicinal materials.

In addition to planning to achieve one million vehicle kilometers per month (30,000 vehicle kilometers per day) on the island's main line, the bureau is actively working with the railway to organize joint island-wide travel transportation. This is a measure to attract tourists by leveraging Taiwan's climate and scenery. All transportation departments are now working towards this goal.

Taiwan will soon exude the atmosphere of Switzerland.

Transportation Administration: Better Than the Japanese

The reporter resides in Beitou, 12.4 kilometers from the provincial capital. Morning and evening, he rides the new Ford cars, marked with the Blue Sky, White Sun, and Whole Earth Red flag, costing thirteen yuan one way. In twenty minutes, they transport him from the hot spring area to the working city area. People say the cars are light, agile, and comfortable, and they can't bear to recall riding in Shanghai's transportation, packed like sardines and slow as snails. Indeed, the Highway Bureau has answered the doubts about the abilities of mainland personnel with unprecedented progress.

Taiwanese people laugh and say: Highway transportation is better than what the Japanese did. Passengers also maintain the Japanese practice of queuing up to buy tickets in order, and the order is maintained. This way of life, in inheriting the spirit of the Japanese, is also worthy of consideration.

### Huaiyin: Political Center of Northern Jiangsu

— Special Dispatch from Huaiyin for this Newspaper, 4th · Reporter Ling Songshou from Taixian

"Han Xin City," "Crotch Bridge," as the hometown of a great figure more than two thousand years ago, and also the distribution center of "Huai Salt" hundreds of miles along the coast, Huaiyin, in the reporter's imagination, is a simple and wealthy city.

But this fantasy was shattered by the reality before me. The current Huaiyin is no longer as simple as imagined, but a hollow, impoverished prosperity.

### Lonely Grand Canal

On Zhongshan Road in the north of the city and Zhongzheng Road in the east, you can see many tall buildings—including banks, hotels, inns… and others. Piles of candy stalls are placed on the streets, attracting people's attention with their colorfulness. The most fashionable clothing materials are displayed in the glass cabinets of silk shops. Glass raincoats and glass leather bags can also be found in department stores.

But, if you venture into the inner layers of Huaiyin to take a look, you will be surprised that this important town on the riverbank has fallen into such a state.

Huaiyin's eight years of enemy and puppet plundering, and one year of destruction by the Communist army, have opened the most difficult page in this city's fate. Originally the only distribution center of "Huai Salt," now, because the salt transport canal is blocked, and the coastal salt-producing areas are still unstable, Huaiyin's salt supply still depends on Yangzhou and northern Anhui.

### Provincial Government Office: Like Giving a Blood Transfusion

To cooperate with the development of the situation in northern Jiangsu, the Jiangsu Provincial Government has set up an office in Huaiyin. This is like injecting a shot of blood transfusion into Huaiyin's prosperity. To say nothing else, there are now more than five hundred party, government, military, group, and other legal entity branch organizations established in Huaiyin. The county government is already exhausted trying to cope with these organizations coming and going, some closing and others opening. Recently, a branch of the Central Bank and a branch of the High Court had a dispute over housing and asked the county government to resolve it. The county magistrate frowned and said: "One is the country's highest financial institution, and the other is a legal and political organ. May I ask, how can I say who is wrong?"

Huaiyin after the great calamity is already a dried-up Huaiyin. Now, let's bring out the evidence.

### Cattle Snatched Away: Tilling the Land with Human Labor

The total area of cultivatable land in Huaiyin County is 1,074,357 mu. Due to the soil quality, the rice yield is zero. The ratio of other grain production is as follows: wheat accounts for 50%, beans account for 20%, miscellaneous grains account for 10%, and others account for 10%. And now the administrative power can control less than 60% (the area that can be controlled in the whole county accounts for 85%). Until now, Huaiyin's food supply still depends on other ports.

Are all these fields able to be cultivated? That is a big question. In a barber shop, I heard the barber tell me: his home is by Hongze Lake. The fields near there are threatened by floods every summer. If you're lucky, the first season of crops (planted in winter) is harvested before the water arrives. If you're unlucky, it's simply submerged, with nothing left. Even in terms of what is harvested, the yields have been greatly reduced. In the past, each mu of land could produce five or six dou, but now it only produces one or two dou. The most serious and worrying problem is that after the villages were ravaged by the Communist army, people scattered and cattle were snatched away (the Communist army lacked transportation and mostly snatched the people's cattle for use). Last year, they even tilled the land with human labor. Unexpectedly, Chinese agriculture, which has always been backward in agricultural tools, has to regress to primitive steps. As for the Grand Canal floods, after the diversion of the Huai River into the sea, people should have been able to rest assured. But unexpectedly, the Communist army breached the dikes to vent their anger when they were about to retreat, hindering the National Army's advance. That breach was 150 meters long and could flood more than 3,500 mu of fields, washing away more than 4,000 shi of grain. Combined with other losses, the estimated amount reached 101,575,000 yuan in national currency. After the recovery of Huaiyin City, repairs were immediately carried out.

### County Finances Extremely Tight: Communist Army Public Grain Used

Under these circumstances, the difficulty of the county's finances is self-evident. Since the autonomous tax was levied on November 15th last year, it has only been able to generate more than 8 million yuan in revenue each month—not including house taxes. House taxes started to be levied this year, and it is expected that 20 million yuan can be collected this quarter, but problems arose not long after it started. The amount of house tax collected is based on the value of the property, so cunning people inevitably take advantage of the opportunity to use tricks, causing the common people to complain endlessly. I personally saw a Baochang bargaining with another person in a bathroom. I asked County Magistrate Huang about the house tax issue, and County Magistrate Huang said to me: "I don't know very clearly either, probably it's always done according to the regulations from above." In order not to disappoint the people in the recovered areas' expectations of the government, and in order not to disappoint the government's virtue towards the people in the recovered areas, I would like to bring this up in the hope that the relevant parties can pay attention to these not-so-small incidents.

The county government is poor, so poor that even the public grain left behind by the Communist army has been used. 90,124 jin of wheat and 20,700 jin of corn left behind by the Communist army were used to provide meals for the county's 126 policemen.

Local Newspaper Pending: Educational Circles Pitiful

It's really unbelievable that a military and political stronghold still doesn't have a local newspaper to this day. To hear the news, apart from hearsay, people can only wait for newspapers from Shanghai that arrived five or six days ago. The reason why the newspaper cannot be published is that, in addition to economic difficulties, it is said that there are various other difficulties. Until I left Huaiyin, according to relevant parties, all the problems have been resolved, and the machine parts and lead type have been transported in, and it will be published soon.

As for education, it is even more pitiful. There are 134 elementary school classes, 100 teachers, and 4,400 students in the county. There is not a single middle school. The Su Ning branch office allocated 6,000 bags of flour to the county government, with 3,000 bags to run a county-run middle school and 3,000 bags to run a county-run hospital. I saw the snow-white flour bags neatly stacked in the county government's auditorium. It is said that the county-run middle school may open next semester, and the county-run hospital may also be established in the short term.

### Administrative Problems in Recovered Areas: People and Wealth Most Difficult

Earlier, I mentioned the Zhen Baochang and the house tax issue. I talked to Ji Zhuanyuan Yuzhi of the seventh district about this. Ji Zhuanyuan said: "The most difficult thing administratively in the recovered areas, apart from money, is the problem of people. And these two factors are mutually reinforcing. Those who can do things locally, after the war, those who died, those who fell into the water, and those who were forcibly taken away by the Communist army, those who are living in other ports, as long as they can live, who wants to rush back to suffer? As a result, those who are doing things locally today are just a group of eliminated people (of course, there are good people and bad people among them). But, under today's situation, you know that he is not strict in his behavior or his efficiency is too poor, and if you want to find another group of people to replace him, it is simply impossible. Because the matter of people always cannot be fulfilled for public benefit, you do not have compensation to give him to stabilize his life. Under these circumstances, it is not easy to gather talents, let alone without people?" Ji Zhuanyuan is a graduate of the third class of Whampoa Military Academy. He has spent half his life in the military, and is quite forthright. This passage indeed reveals the most serious problems in the current administration of the recovered areas.

Director Wang Gongyu of the Department is a native of Guanyun County in northern Jiangsu. He listed six key points for promoting administrative work in the recovered areas of northern Jiangsu to the reporter, namely: (1) solving the economic and talent difficulties, (2) emphasizing both rule by man and rule by law, (3) recognizing difficulties and overcoming difficulties, (4) ensuring public security, (5) accepting conscience, (6) recognizing reality and seizing opportunities. In addition, Director Wang also talked to the reporter about the land problem in northern Jiangsu. His opinion is: "Northern Jiangsu is densely populated and land is scarce. On average, each farmer can only have four mu of land. How can we smoothly promote land reform without hindering the farmers' living conditions? This is a matter worthy of attention. In short, the only key point is to be able to adapt to local conditions and seize this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity."

General Li Jifu, Deputy Director of the Xuzhou Pacification Headquarters, is a famous general who has fought in a hundred battles. This time, in order to command from nearby, General Li specially stationed in Huaiyin. He took the time out of his busy schedule to have a few minutes of conversation with the reporter, and said to the reporter: "The work of suppressing the remaining bandits in northern Jiangsu depends on the early completion of the people's self-defense force. When the people's self-defense force is completed, the bandits will inevitably be suppressed, and local order will be stabilized accordingly." General Li finally said, "In any case, the government must ensure that the people in the recovered areas have food to eat." At this time of biting north wind and freezing frost and snow, General Li's two sentences will bring infinite warmth to the people in the recovered areas!

### Appeal from Lost Students in Changde, Hunan

I am an eighteen-year-old student who has lost his education in Changde City, Xiangxi. Since the Japanese invaded our country, the youth in the areas invaded have suffered the misfortune of losing their education. In the winter of the 32nd year of the Republic (1943), Changde City suffered the same ravages. I, who was only receiving middle school education, was also drawn into the whirlpool of losing my education. Our country fought for eight years, and the whole people relied on the leadership of Chairman Chiang to finally achieve victory. Although the world war has been resolved, after the great trauma and deep pain of our country, the heavy burden of reconstruction and construction is pressing on the shoulders of our youth. However, the Communist Party refuses to lay down its butcher knife, and reconstruction and construction are being hindered everywhere. Although we hold a very strong will to shoulder the mission of creating a new China, we cannot obtain any way out. Therefore, we make an appeal, asking the Communist Party not to use force to seize power again, but to return the army to the country, so that the National Government can actively engage in reconstruction and construction, so that a large group of students who have lost their education and unemployment can obtain a way out. Otherwise, the Communist Party is an act of treason and a public enemy of the people! (Youth Yang Sanlin from Changde)

Spring and Autumn

### Remembering Pingling on the Cold Day of Tung Flowers

— Lumaang

These days are exactly the season of "Cold Tung Flowers" in Jiangnan, even colder than the end of winter. We can't make a fire in the house, we don't have leather clothes when we go out, and from time to time we are hit by news that makes us "feel cold". It is not only bleak, but trembling!

Reading "Spring and Autumn," I suddenly saw Mr. Wang Pingling's masterpiece, and I couldn't help but feel emotional and yearning. Human feelings often flow towards warmth, and so do literati. In the various banners on our side, the three words "Wang Pingling" are no longer mentioned. This man has thirty years of literary history and has struggled all his life. But that's okay, Mr. Pingling is living in seclusion in a mountain city, seeking his own happiness, and does not want to engage in bare-knuckle fights with heroes with bronze muscles and iron bones, but lives a life without worries, without strife, and without demands.

Chongqing, this distant mountain city, is noisy and ugly in my writing. Friends from Jiangnan who have read "Eight Years in Chongqing" probably won't have any good feelings, but after reading Mr. Pingling's "Beautiful Mountain City," even I feel yearning. This is due to social changes. Just like a village girl, dressed in plain clothes, has her original style, but once she changes her clothes, she is often vulgar and unbearable. When Chongqing was the wartime capital, all kinds of people competed to enter, and the loyal and treacherous were juxtaposed. The small mountain city was crowded and unbearable, and naturally there were many people and things that people couldn't stand. After the return to peace, it must naturally return to its original position. However, we here are crowded with people, rubbing shoulders, because it also belongs to the city being competed for, the dynasty being competed for, and it is even more noisy and ugly, and our heads are dizzy. Mr. Pingling evokes beautiful memories in his thoughts of his hometown, and therefore mentions "good days in spring and autumn, apricot flowers blooming, green willows and birds singing; West Lake painting boats, Xuanwu green lotuses, Louxia red leaves, Deng Wei wax plums," and envies the happiness of those who return home. I am one of the first people to return home, not only suffering from being squeezed in the crowd of people competing for fame and fortune, but also for a year and a half, I have never appreciated the beautiful scenery of Qixia red leaves, Deng Wei wax plums, Xuanwu green lotuses, and even the six bridges and three temples. Why? Since "Victory," not only has there been no peaceful scene, but wars have been frequent and people have been living in poverty, so there is no leisurely mood to enjoy the mountains and rivers, and no money to do so. Although Jiangnan is good, how is it different from outside the Great Wall? Although returning home is early, it is even more meaningless. Therefore, I deeply feel that since there is today, why did we have it in the first place. I already felt the feeling of "Why did we have it in the first place" in last year's "Spring and Autumn", but now I sigh even more and feel even deeper. Dissatisfied with the status quo, I recall more. Everything before the war now seems to be lovely and precious everywhere. Even everything in Chongqing during the war is more satisfactory than now. It is not as bad as it is now, no wonder I, who did not think Chongqing was lovely, now have the same feelings as Pingling and admire Chongqing very much. Mr. Pingling has already said the scenery in the suburbs of Chongqing, so I won't repeat it, but when I think of the Nanshan where Pingling lives, I can't help but mention it again:

On the banks of the Yangtze River, or at a high point in the city, we always see a row of mountains in the south, with undulating peaks and lush greenery. The tall trees around Lao Jun Cave, as well as the temples and pagodas, are all attractive. I lived under the Futu Pavilion for a full four years, working hard and living a simple life. When I felt mentally tired, I would stop on the dam and watch the long Yangtze River flowing slowly. My line of sight crossed the Yangtze River, and then I stared at Nanshan in the distance: when the weather was clear, the Futu temples could be counted one by one, in the fog, the layers of peaks were faintly visible; on moonlit nights, I knew there was a fairyland in front in the hazy sky, and I thought of my good friend of twenty years even more. He lives in "Lizhuang" in the "mid-mountain", with three thatched cottages, bright windows and clean tables, looking north at the capital, not moved by fame and fortune, always guarding his position in cloth clothes. At the beginning of the War of Resistance, he often went to the city to participate in gatherings of the cultural world, but later these gatherings rarely saw his trace. He only reads books and writes essays in the mid-mountain. Indeed, Wang Pingling is a literati without any ambition or attempt, without any dispute, and without offending anyone. Some people think that Wang Pingling is useless and lacks the spirit of struggle, which is completely a colored view. Wang Pingling has the spirit of a traditional Chinese literati, why imitate Dong Shi and fight at every turn? Geng Pingling doesn't want to use literature and art as a stepping stone to enter officialdom, unlike some people who try to obtain the title of social worthy. It is undeniable that Wang Pingling did contribute to politics in those years, but at that time it was just a good intention, without any attempt. He has contributed his efforts and that's it. People didn't thank him, and he didn't mind. Now that he is in his fifties, due to physical and mental strength, and having seen through the world, he no longer has the good intention of serving politics. Many people are still urging him to come down the mountain, but he will not come down the mountain again. He said: "This year's New Year, I am very grateful to my friends in Jiangnan for sending letters from thousands of miles away, asking about the date of return. That piece of earnest kindness can tease my thoughts, but looking east, I don't know what era it is in the world, or I will stay in the high mountain city and watch the changing world." Pingling, beyond things, keeps himself clean and loves himself, and will end his life in the mountain city, unless his friends don't believe what I say.

On the cold day of tung flowers, I miss my old friend bitterly, and I write this casual and humble letter to make Mr. Jinshan smile.

### Love is Life

— Translated by Chen Yin

In the nineteenth century, an emperor conducted an educational experiment. He wanted to see what words a child would say if he was not taught – was it an ancient language, Latin, Greek, or his own dialect.

So he adopted some newborn orphans and told the nannies to take good care of them, but with one order: they were not allowed to speak or express any emotion to the babies. As a result, these babies died early. It is said that it was because "they could not live without the warmth and affection of their caregivers."

### White Elephant

— Sudan

Six years ago, I once gave a small white elephant to a friend. At that time, I was just a boy who did not understand romance. Although the feelings were pure, I did not understand that precious emotion. As the years went by, I now find those youthful dreams lovely and cherish them. Recently, I often miss that small white elephant, like longing for a distant lover.

Whenever the evening sunset sways in front of the window, whenever I greedily enjoy the rouge red of the setting sun, memories always entice me to step into the old courtyard, allowing me to caress the golden warmth...

It was early summer, and the early summer sunlight was gently shining on the green leaves outside the window, creating a serene atmosphere indoors. One quiet afternoon, I paid a farewell visit. - This meeting became a crystal pearl in my memory, bright and clear. It is a dream trace on the pages of my life, which will remain until the end of my life.

That unforgettable afternoon, lightly, with the melancholy of a young man, I walked into the lush green courtyard, climbed the white stone steps, and saw a charming smile through the green gauze window. The leisurely atmosphere made me forget my worries, forget the slight melancholy of farewell. The two young children were like a pair of small yellow sparrows in a green silk cage hanging in front of the window, murmuring, murmuring, talking, laughing, talking so much, so far, forgetting that one would fly away tomorrow. Perhaps it was precisely because it was a time when youth did not know the taste of sorrow, not remembering that tomorrow would be a day of parting, nor thinking that mountains and rivers would separate us, let alone understanding that parting would paint a desolate, irreplaceable, eternal emptiness in life...

Quietly, time slipped away from our rambling words, and I was still indifferent. When the sunset fell on the window, although there was endless reluctance, who could keep whom? There was only a gentle farewell! My friend gave me a copy of "A Nest of Gentlefolk" as a memory box - that green book deeply concealed too much lingering thought, which I did not realize at the time. - Walking out of the small garden's heavy doors, I walked back, and I let a small white elephant - a delicate ornament - be my friend's attendant.

Later, when someone asked me about the symbolism of the white elephant, my purity made me feel a slight sense of shame. My heart raced, and I concealed my feelings of love. I pretended that I didn't understand. Since then, the white elephant has become my confusing secret. Why didn't I capture the fleeting youth and hidden emotions at that time? Six years have passed, many storms and clear skies, many smiles and tears. I have endured too much worldly dust. Life has taught me to hide and disguise, and it has also taught me to cherish the youthful infatuation!

Parting has made our distance far, and years have made the distance between our hearts even farther. I have no magic wand to summon back the delicate youth, nor can I recall the lost dreams. Was it wisdom that made me suppress my emotions? Or was it foolishness? Now I think of that little white elephant, it is when I fly back to that lush green courtyard on the wings of memory. Now I have a faint melancholy, I have a faint worry, will I cry because of the withering of longing?...

Now, I often think of that small white elephant. I think of the feelings I gave it. For six years, has my small white elephant been my faithful messenger? Is it still safely hidden in that delicate little closet?

### To Mr. Zheng Wuchang on His Birthday

— Shi Liang

Recently, Mr. Wuchang celebrated his 54th birthday, and his students in Shanghai held a get-together celebration at the Ningbo Road Qianzhuang Club. I was also fortunate to be among them. During the banquet, classmate Wang Ruonan showed me a poem he had written for the birthday celebration. After reading it, not wanting to be left behind, I quickly composed two poems, expressing my respect. I do not care about the quality of my work.

The Southern Star shines, the Big Dipper hangs high,
From ancient times, great virtue enjoys a long life.
Painting and calligraphy make a name for the world,
A model teacher in the literary world of a generation.
Four seats of orchids are connected like jade shoots,
Peach and plum blossoms fill the walls, intoxicated at the jade banquet,
Let us jointly wish for boundless longevity,
The poem borrows the first chapter of the Book of Odes.

The Huangpu River encircles, the moon hangs bright,
The Eastern Sea's auspicious spirit records extended years.
Sesame fields and Shang Mountains add benevolence and longevity,
Clear moon and gentle breeze compare to ancient sages.
Gladly, the Cheng Gate allows one to stand in the snow,
It is right to celebrate the opening of the Sea House banquet,
Next year, when we meet again to offer birthday wishes,
I will wildly capture three hundred poems.

### An Inch of Mountain and River, an Inch of Blood 182

— Ye Jingfeng

But was Konoe willing to listen to Tsurumi's words just like that? This move was also within our expectations. Therefore, Tsurumi also had to send a secret telegram to Elder Aoki, asking him to pay attention to this future tragedy in North China. And asking him to quickly save this great calamity, to leave some reputation for the Japanese soldiers. These two secret telegrams were all handled by "012" stationed in Tokyo.

At the same time, we anticipated that Konoe's instructions might not come so quickly, so in addition to Tsurumi's own falsely transmitted "imperial edict", we also asked "012" to send another "imperial edict" directly to Matsui, which had to arrive around nine o'clock, as proof of Tsurumi's private telegram. In this way, Matsui could not help but believe it, and even more could not help but carry out the order.

Originally, the organization of the Japanese military was extremely strict, and the ingenuity of the General Staff Headquarters was especially tight. How could Tsurumi, such a small figure, be allowed to act so arbitrarily; to send telegrams as he pleased, and to forge orders as he pleased?

We don't need to worry too much about this point. Nor can we underestimate Tsurumi's small secret organization. Although Tsurumi's organization is small, it holds the throat of Japanese intelligence work in reporting secret information. Although it cannot grasp all the reports, it can always grasp a certain percentage. Moreover, the plan we designed was based on Konoe's hypocritical mentality. Before and after the event, it would be difficult to detect even the slightest trace. Even if he himself received some influence, because the content of this instruction was very much in line with his intentions, he might not want to investigate; he would even think that it "agreed with my heart".

Moreover, we have the potential of Elder Aoki buried. Sooner or later, Konoe will have to issue the order to "attack the heart is the best strategy"; the only difference is in the "time" point. According to our ideal, the difference in this time will be no more than seventy or eighty hours at most. This small matter of a few hours difference is extremely easy to make up for in the hands of "012". Since Japan launched the war of aggression against the mainland, twenty-four hours a day, clear telegrams and secret codes have never stopped for a second. Who has so much free time to check such a small difference?

Tsurumi went out alone, on the one hand, to inquire about the enemy's situation, and on the other hand, to respond to Matsui's request to find Wu Dingyuan. By the way, he also had to investigate how many so-called "unstable elements" they had detained; what kind of people were detained; the location of the detention, and the strength of the guards, also had to be investigated clearly in order to carry out a surprise attack.

The above steps must be completed before ten o'clock. The second step, the main point of the plan - the surprise attack - is expected to start around ten thirty and be completed around twelve o'clock. The first goal of the surprise attack is to liberate both the overt and covert detained "unstable elements", and the second is to demonstrate. But it does not advocate excessive bloodshed, so as not to stimulate the enemy's bestiality and destroy the hard-prepared "falsely transmitted imperial edict".

The method of attack and retreat is entirely in accordance with Yaoqun's revised proposal: 1. The original command team, because it must reduce the enemy's concentrated attack target, has been changed into a sporadic guidance station, one person per station, set up at the necessary intersections to and from, using various disguises as concealment, such as night market vendors, rickshaw pullers, beggars, patrolmen, etc.; pointing out the way forward when advancing, and pointing out the way back when retreating.

2. The action team does not use large troops, but changes to sniper units, three people per unit, using a triangular scouting post to advance or retreat; the number of units is determined according to the report obtained by Tsurumi's reconnaissance.

3. The original ten or more teams of the escort team, the car-mounted machine gun team, are deployed on the periphery of the action center to protect the attack and safe retreat of the action team. Yaoqun believes that this target is too obvious. Although it has the demonstration effect of strong advance and strong retreat, it is too stimulating, which may cause a large-scale search by the enemy; it is not difficult for our team and cars to escape, but once a large-scale search by the enemy, the whole city will still be turned upside down.

Yaoqun's proposal is to use the "inverted thorn" small group method, with two people as a group. If the action team is pursued, the inverted thorn small group will snipe behind the enemy, as a "reliable" cover. The area where this small group is ambushed must be a dark and lively street intersection, separated to the left and right to prevent being surrounded. The retreat can still use cars, but they are scattered in all directions. Of course, there are guiding sentry posts along the way to guide the advance and retreat.

Other various attack arrangements, such as sentries, slogans, symbols, positions, responses, cover, sudden changes, effect reconnaissance, etc., still follow Mr. Jian's plan.

### Prohibition of Novels

— Zhenzhi

The prohibition of novels in the Qing Dynasty, from 1652 to 1868, a period of more than 210 years, occurred a total of ten times. These ten times are: (1) Shunzhi 9th year (1652); (2) Kangxi 48th year (1709); (3) Kangxi 53rd year (1714); (4) Qianlong 1st year (1736); (5) Jiaqing 7th year (1802); (6) Jiaqing 15th year (1810); (7) Jiaqing 18th year (1813) - the above are all found in Yu Zhengxie's "Gui Yi Manuscript" Volume 9; the one in Kangxi 53rd year is also found in Liu Tingji's "Zaiyuan Miscellaneous Notes" Volume 2 - (8) Daoguang 14th year (1834), see Deng Zhicheng's "Gudong Suoji" Volume 3; (9) Daoguang 24th year (1844), see the Daoguang edition of "Quan Hui Yinshu Zhengxinlu"; (10) Tongzhi 7th year (1868), see the Tongzhi "Jiangsu Shengli". The first eight of these ten prohibitions were based on the Qing court's edicts, and the latter two were presided over by local authorities. The one in Daoguang 24th year was a petition from Zhang Jian and other gentry in Zhejiang, accompanied by a list of 120 books. The one in Tongzhi 7th year was initiated by Jiangsu Governor Ding Richang. The list of books was in two batches, and a total of 154 novels were banned. It was based on the list of books from Daoguang, with another 34 added (also attached was a list of 110 books of obscene lyrics and singing).

However, the prohibition of novels did not begin in the Qing Dynasty. It had already been done once in the middle of the Ming Dynasty. "Rizhilu Zhiyu" Volume 12, "Prohibition of Novels" quoted a "Shilu" saying:

"In the second month of the seventh year of Zhengtong, the Guozijian Jijiu Li Shinian said: Recently, there have been vulgar scholars who falsely claim strange events and embellish them with unfounded words, such as "Jian Deng Xin Hua" and the like. Not only do frivolous people in the market compete to recite and study them, but even classic scholars mostly abandon their studies and memorize them day and night for discussion. If they are not strictly prohibited, I fear that heretical and heterodox doctrines will become increasingly prevalent, confusing people's minds. I beg the Ministry of Rites to issue documents to all internal and external yamen and to the Tiel school, the Qian shi Yushi, and the Ancha si officers, who will patrol the places. Whenever they encounter such books, they should order them to be burned. Those who print and sell them or secretly study them will be punished according to the law. So that people will know the right way and not be confused by heresies."

According to the seventh year of Zhengtong Renxu, it is 1442 in the Western calendar. About 210 years earlier than the ninth year of Shunzhi. The quoted "Shilu" seems to be the "Zhengtong Shilu". I do not have the "Da Ming Shilu" at hand, so I cannot check this original text.

The only novel known to have been banned this time is "Jian Deng Xin Hua". In the early and middle Ming Dynasty, popular novels were not yet very developed, and they only became increasingly prosperous after the Jiajing period. The ones that circulated in the early and middle periods were mostly of the legendary literary type. This type of novel inherited the aftermath of Tang Dynasty legends, and was recently influenced by Yuan and Song Dynasty Meidong's "Rouhong Ji", and the trend became increasingly rampant. By the time Qu You's "Jian Deng Lu", "Jian Deng Xin Hua", and Li Zhen's "Jian Deng Yu Hua" were published, they intensified their efforts, and imitators followed one after another, such as Zhao Bi's "Xiaoxie Ji", Zhou Li's "Bingzhu Qingtan", Qiu Jun's "Zhongqing Feiji", Lu Meihu's "Huaichun Yaji", etc., which ran alongside popular novels in the Jiajing and Wanli periods. The "Jian Deng Xin Hua" banned in the Zhengtong period was a representative of this type of "talented and romantic novel".

The prohibition of novels in the Ming and Qing Dynasties is roughly as described above. But were there any prohibitions in the Yuan Dynasty? According to "Yuan Shi" Volume 105 "Xingfa Zhi" Fifty-third, Xingfa (4) Prohibitions says:

"All common people's children, not engaging in business, often sing lyrics and stories in cities and towns, teach miscellaneous plays, and gather crowds for licentious entertainment, all of which are prohibited and punished."

This prohibits the singing of lyrics and stories, not the banning of novel books. The two are completely different. As far as is known now, there is not enough literature to show that there was also a prohibition of novels in the Yuan Dynasty.

### The Philosophy of Borrowing Money

— Qilou Zhuren

A university professor talked about the way of life for poor people. He said that the first thing is to be diligent in getting haircuts, and the second is to try to avoid borrowing money. I have not fully followed the former, but I have indeed been very "diligent" in the latter.

Naturally, I sometimes borrow money from the few people who will not distance "me" and despise "me" because of borrowing money. Sometimes I have borrowed money from friends just to make my hand more comfortable. These friends understand me, and their friendship is not built on the word "money". Borrowing money is really seen as something that should be in their friendship, so sometimes I ask them to borrow, and sometimes they borrow from me, and they will definitely pay back when they borrow.

As for some other people, they seem to expect me to negotiate with them as soon as they see me, and draw a clear line with me economically everywhere. They are always afraid of me seeing more than two banknotes, and for people who do so, I will never ask them for any financial friendship, as my teacher said, because what they see of me is just the word "poor", not the word "urgent". Even if I have a great need, in their eyes it is just a poor look. They are saviors in times of urgency, not saviors of poverty.

When I was hiding in the countryside, I was once in a difficult situation. At that time, there were many rich households hiding in the countryside with me. In the chaotic situation, robberies occurred day and night. Although I was poor, I had the identity of a city dweller, so there was always the possibility of being coveted. One day, in front of several local hooligans, I had to use a little trick, saying that I was having a hard time and was going to borrow money from someone. This someone had power and money, and no one would dare to touch him.

A few days later, I happened to stroll over to his place to see a friend. As soon as he saw me, his face changed. I immediately knew what he was thinking and felt that I had to explain it to him. I told him that I had resolutely said the word borrow money (his face looked even worse at this time), but I was just using Chen Ping's clever trick to repel thieves. As soon as these words were spoken, his face really seemed like a clear sky after rain, and he immediately piled on a heartfelt smile. This was a cheerful look that I had never seen on his face before.

The teacher's philosophy of not borrowing money from people is the best example of this. You see how happy it can make people not to borrow money!

### A Small Tour of Dinghu Lake, Lake City God Mountain

— Meishan

I have been in Hangzhou for nearly a year, and I have long known about the liveliness of Chenghuang Mountain [Wu Mountain], but I have never been able to visit it. Recently, prices have soared, and my mood has become even more apprehensive. My job is also in a state of semi-suspension. I always feel a stuffy feeling in my chest, so in the afternoon, I took a heavy heart and walked alone to Chenghuang Mountain.

Going in from Qinghefang Dajing Alley is the entrance to the mountain. Stepping on the layers of brick-paved mountain paths, I walked to the Chenghuang, Taisui, and Lao Dongyue temples. Smoke filled the air, and incense swirled around, making those towering and evil images with black heads and brains even more terrifying. In front of the Chenghuang Temple is a large square, from which you can overlook the entire city. The scaled buildings face a lake, and the entire paradise scene is clearly visible.

Further on are the Three Martyrs Shrine and the July 7th Memorial Altar. Inside the altar stands a stone tablet with the three characters "Fire Ox Tribulation". It is said that it is to commemorate the invading enemies. "Fire Ox" represents the year "Ding Chou", but placing it next to the Three Martyrs Shrine, which resisted Hong Yang, always feels a bit inappropriate.

The only feature on the mountain, besides the dilapidated temples and the flourishing smoke, is the large number of fortune-tellers and astrologers. Hangzhou is known as the "Buddhist Kingdom" and "Paradise", and these may be the living gods in "Paradise".

In this day and age, people really only "ask the heavens" and "believe in ghosts and gods". They probably seized on this point, desperately flaunting their mystery and talking about philosophy, aiming at your lucky psychology of "getting promoted and making a fortune", and talking highly about their set of wife, wealth, son, and officialdom. I looked carefully at each place. Although most of the customers were middle-aged and older businessmen, needless to say, they were asking about "wealth" during the New Year, but there were also those who wore fur coats and looked like noble ladies, and young people in neat Western suits and military uniforms, full of energy, listening to them judging their bones and touching their hands to judge their lifelong honor and suffering.

I brought a heavy heart, but I returned with the same confusion. "Paradise" cannot be separated from the mortal world, and of course, I only saw this group of fortune-tellers asking about wealth and seeking beauty.

### Notes and Students - Teaching

— Nianzi

Because I had something to do, I took the No. 2 tram from Xujiahui. Two people who looked like businessmen came up at Luban Road. They chatted from the weather to the problem of education in China, and from the problem of education in China, they narrowed down to the Chinese professors. As a student, I immediately concentrated and listened attentively.

One, wearing a Russian hat, said: "Ah, brother! Don't think professors are hard to be, but in fact, if you break it down, they are really worthless - simply a gramophone. This year, they hold a copy of notes and copy them on the blackboard without changing a word. Next year, they will copy the same way, and the year after, of course, they will do the same without exception... After a few years, people have already invented a new theory, and that great professor is still instilling the same old tune into the students. The students are even too lazy to go to class, and they only know how to borrow the notes from the previous class to cram. Originally, it was a subject with research potential, but now it has become a dead thing like the 'Three Character Classic' in a private school. I heard that a university opened a course called 'Modern Physics', which, as the name suggests, must contain the most advanced theories of modern times. After a few classes, a nosy student, after investigating in all directions, found that the notes copied down were really the things that the professor had collected during his student days. If you want to mark the year, it is already an antique with twenty-seven years of history. I can assert that in another twenty-seven years, as long as this professor does not retire and return to his hometown, his only magic weapon will definitely be this set of notes that has not changed a word, which is really wronging the word 'modern'..."

Another one with deep nearsightedness, said with a smile: "Haha! They have great principles, for example, if someone asks the professor you just mentioned, why can't some 'modern' traces be found in modern physics? Then he will definitely say with a mocking tone: The so-called modern physics is just a new theory derived from the original old ones. The principle is the same, you are only qualified to lay the foundation..."

The one wearing the Russian hat suddenly became impatient and said loudly: "Forget it! It's okay for students to recite books by rote, it's okay to put on airs, anyway, it's the students who are unlucky. To be honest: being able to teach an old set of notes that is twenty-seven years old is already considered so-so, the question is whether his set of notes is already a family heirloom of decades."

### The Whispering of Swallows and the Singing of Orioles Dissipate One's Sorrows — Two of a Series on Declining and Decadent Bird Markets

— Zhu Guang

Before the war in Shanghai, even before the Pacific War on December 8th, the number of exotic and rare birds and beasts imported from overseas was quite substantial. The more prized birds generally came from Vietnam, Annam, Malaya, the Dutch East Indies, Southeast Asia, and North and South America, with Hong Kong as their main hub. There were also quite a few from Japan. According to the old-timer in the bird trade, "birds from areas around Annam and Siam, such as the Shrike, are naturally clever and can learn various dialects in a short period. Their 'genius' in language is actually far superior to that of humans, who are less eloquent." Domestic Mynas, if naturally intelligent, can also learn simple language, but these so-called "pedigree breeds" have not only ceased to be imported recently, but even domestic ones (from producing areas such as Shandong and Hebei) are rarely transported. No wonder the boss said with emotion: "The number of goods arriving now is simply less than one percent of what it was before the war."

Setting Up Nets and Traps: The methods of catching birds are quite interesting. Apart from naturally docile birds such as canaries and white-eyes, which are mostly raised from collected eggs, there are so-called "sky nets and earth nets" (using huge, movable nets). There are also so-called "high sticky poles," used to catch sparrows and the like, mostly with bamboo poles two or three stories high, topped with sticky glue, and the pole extended to scoop and stick. There are so-called "trap cages," which are very cleverly structured movable cages, with a "decoy bird" in the middle to attract others of its kind, and four movable windows on the lower level, specifically for catching small birds. The lower end is fitted with two large movable treadles, which are traps specifically designed for larger birds such as Mynas and Hwamei. In the Hangzhou and Shaoxing areas of Zhejiang, there are also so-called "interlocking cages," named because the movable treadles can create an automatic, continuous trapping effect. The above are mostly handicraft-style bird-catching methods frequently used by bird hunters in China. As for Southeast Asia and foreign countries, that is unknown.

In addition, there is also a method of using anesthesia, soaking rice in strong liquor and placing it in open areas as bait. Once the birds swallow it, they become drunk and unconscious, at one's disposal, but this can only be said to be a primitive, local method.

The interests of bird enthusiasts, apart from their love for their appearance, such as the color of their feathers, their "figure," and their bodies, are mainly to appreciate the small movements of these small animals flapping their wings and their clear, melodious chirping. Those obsessed with birds invariably take the occasional "loud call" as a joy. As the saying goes, the whispering of swallows and the singing of orioles dissipate one's sorrows, which probably refers to this state. The so-called "loud call" is said to be the loud laughter of birds when they are elated and beside themselves with joy, while the murmuring and twittering sounds are merely human whispers, and are not worth mentioning.

Detailed Consideration: In order to elicit these "charming" actions and "pleasant" "loud calls," bird enthusiasts treat their birds with detailed consideration and utmost care. Their cautious and conscientious attitude is really far above serving their own parents, and at the very least should not be below taking care of their most favored concubines. They meticulously arrange food, drink, warmth, grooming, and bathing for these small animals, and even spare no effort to rush from all corners to the racecourse and the buildings, attending bird gatherings and tea parties to find partners for their beloved feathered friends, to relieve their loneliness and unhappiness in the cage. At the racecourse, many friends carrying birdcages come from Caojiadu, Xujiahui, and Yangshupu, and even further from Pudong and Caohejing and other suburban areas of Shanghai!

According to informal statistics, northerners generally like to play with "martial birds," while southerners like to raise "literary birds," which is probably due to the different temperaments of the people in the two regions. As for rare and precious birds such as the red-billed green-bodied parrots and other rare birds from Europe, America, and Southeast Asia, they are usually used by wealthy officials and wealthy families as decorations or ornaments for their magnificent furnishings. In terms of the degree of affection, they are certainly not comparable to those bird-obsessed friends mentioned above.

### "Sichuan Landscape Painting": Sichuan Daughter Wearing a Large Straw Hat.

### Closing Empty Couplets

— Chun

The other day I saw in the newspaper a couplet by Jin Xihou mourning the young actress Li Shifang, "Calamity from heaven," "Eternal fame," which was perfectly charming. I couldn't help but think of when the poet Xu Zhimo died in a plane crash, a certain gentleman mourned with the couplet: "Soared to heaven in one flight, three people shared the same fate," "Prostrated themselves on the ground, all four elements were empty," which was indeed accurate. Also, Wang Changchun's elegy for Xu, "All four elements are ultimately empty, looking down on the mortal world like straw dogs," "Floating life is truly like a dream, reaching the highest heaven and the lowest hell," was even more filled with emotion.

Movie Talk

### Further Discussion on "Gaslight"

— Ma Boliang

In the spacious old house with flickering gaslights, a grey mist covered everything, unable to dissipate, forming such darkness. The darkness was heavy, with a muffled cry everywhere. By the icy hearth, solidified shadows, a damp street, a silent hall, a winding staircase, footsteps from the back of the house, and even the people in the murals glared with murderous eyes. It is this mysterious atmosphere that shows the panic, loneliness, and nervous stimulation of a weak woman, and it is also this atmosphere that makes one feel that marrying a husband like this is truly heartbreaking for a woman. In terms of creating a strong, dense color, director George Cukor is undoubtedly successful. After "Camille," "A Double Life," and "Little Women," he has established a new milestone. Because having seen "Suspicion" and "Gaslight," we feel that the psychological stories of murder cases between couples were originally meaningless and have now become clichés. The special excellence of "Gaslight" is entirely due to the director's handling and the actors' acting skills. With flexible camera work, George Cukor consistently depicts the silent climax. He does not film the struggle head-on like ordinary directors, preserving the literary atmosphere, and he always cleverly uses sound to skip the fighting scene. However, for some reason, he even eliminates the development of the climax, so that the ending takes a sudden turn.

The most remarkable is still Ingrid Bergman's acting, which every movie audience must see. To be honest, Ingrid Bergman made few achievements in "Casablanca" and "The Bells of St. Mary's," and even failed in "Suspicion." This is the first time she has shown us the invincibility of her skills. No wonder she won the 1944 Academy Award for this, and no wonder she considers this film her masterpiece. I used to think that Joan Crawford's determination in "A Woman's Face" was rare, but now I know that Ingrid Bergman has even more charm and gentleness. Recently, after watching "To Each His Own," I felt that Olivia de Havilland understood middle-aged business women, playing the mental state of three ages with great realism. In the second half, after crying, she held her face in her hands in front of the friar and the viscount, which was purely inspired and amazing. But when it comes to Olivia's overall acting, it always seems difficult to draw a conclusion. Ingrid Bergman here, however, makes people applaud without hesitation. She not only gradually and meticulously portrays the psychology of a person whose nerves have been overstimulated to the point of weakness, expressing the dazed, weak, dreamlike state, but also the fluttering dance when playing the piano, the goose-necked arms when kissing, the disappointed gestures when handing over the painting after asking for help on the stairs. These movements all have a very quick, flexible, and harmonious beauty, like a drooping flower. The lines are also read with rhythm, with both slowness and speed. Some stars can match her depth, but they often lose sight of one thing while focusing on another, unable to be complete. Therefore, I dare say that Ingrid Bergman has defeated Greer Garson in "Madame Curie" with this role.

I can't forget the song "The Last Rose of Summer" in the film. Beautiful girls are all roses, but the person who treads on the jade and tramples on the flowers is autumn after summer. Roses cannot withstand time, and once it passes, they wither. Fortunately, the Sheila in "Gaslight" did not pass autumn, but still exuded a fragrance after the summer.
