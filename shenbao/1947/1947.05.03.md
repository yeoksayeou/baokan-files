Their hidden party members are all rebels and military spies.

(4) The "Democratic United Front," which the Democratic League is currently in the process of forming, is also "preparing to be a new tool of rebellion for the Chinese Communists under the orders of the Central Committee." (5) The Chinese Communists are secretly sending people to infiltrate and lurk in various social organizations and parties throughout the country, especially the Kuomintang, the Youth Party, and the Democratic Socialist Party, to carry out rumors, so-called "incitement," and divisive tactics, conspiring to divide the strength of the various parties and create internal strife. (6) The Chinese Communists will strengthen the sabotage of railway tracks, important bridges, and attacks on stations and telecommunications agencies in the rear area. (7) The Chinese Communists are actively unifying rural bandits and armed forces, attempting to integrate them into a whole, expand disturbances, and endanger the rear area.

### Zhu Shizheng Surrenders; Expresses Regret for the "Tianlu Incident" in Xikang Province; Reports the Circumstances of Being Instructed by Others

[This newspaper, Ya'an, 1st] Zhu Shizheng and Li Yuanheng, who previously presided over the "Tianlu Incident" in Xikang Province, were moved by the government's leniency and voluntarily came to Ya'an to surrender themselves to the authorities, willing to abide by the law. They also submitted a letter of repentance to Chairman Liu Wenhui, stating that they were exploited and their reckless actions. The original text is as follows: "Last winter, a Mr. Xu, dressed in a yellow wool military uniform, suddenly came to the township to negotiate, claiming to be under the order of a certain senior official, specially coming to help the people of Xikang to relieve their suffering. The ambitious people of Xikang should rise up and provide firearms, ammunition, and food, and he was willing to command the troops in the team. He also urged the establishment of a Political Reform Committee. He also claimed that someone was working in Beijing, Shanghai, and Chongqing to provide support, and that this was a case of internal and external coordination, and that military and political operations would be carried out in coordination, which would surely be successful, etc. Therefore, we did not consider it carefully, and always thought that the background was very strong. As long as an incident was launched, the goal could be achieved. Unexpectedly, a moment of impulsiveness was misled, and we did not know that the situation was getting worse and worse, which caused a great disaster to the local area, which was not expected by us. All because of limited knowledge, being instructed by others, made a big mistake, which is too late to regret."

### The CCP Establishes a Struggle Plan, Attempting a Full-Scale Armed Uprising; Secret Documents of the Communists Discovered in Northern Shaanxi

[Central News Agency, Yan'an, 2nd] After rejecting peace talks and withdrawing its delegations stationed in Beijing, Shanghai, Ping, and Yu, the CCP, in preparation for new conspiracy struggles in government areas, instructed its hidden party members to instigate its peripheral organizations to launch a full-scale armed uprising. It is reported that Mao Zedong, Liu Shaoqi, Zhang Wentian, and others went to Wayao Fort on February 11 to convene an expanded Political Bureau meeting, presided over by Mao Zedong, who proposed a plan for underground struggle. The plan was approved and issued on March 12, signed by Mao Zedong, Zhang Wentian, Zhou Enlai, Liu Shaoqi, Zhu De, Ye Jianying, and Peng Dehuai. The full text of the general program for this underground struggle has recently been obtained in the Northern Shaanxi area. It is recorded as follows:

Launch Popular Uprisings and Strikes

Political Aspects: (1) Reduce the size of the party's work committees in various regions and prepare for new struggles through extremely secret groups, launching popular uprisings, strikes, anti-violence, and rent resistance action struggles. (2) Unite progressive social groups and free individuals, fellow travelers, and connect with workers and peasants, especially poor and hired farmers, and poor people in rural areas, and their representative forces, in a non-neutral stance, to form a united front for democracy, patriotism, anti-dictatorship, and anti-civil war. (3) Use the four mainstays of the Democratic League, the Democratic National Construction Association, the Three People's Principles Comrades Association, and the Association for Promoting Democracy as a call to action, and in industrial centers, absorb the masses and neutral entrepreneurs as a solid foundation for initial victories. (4) Regional committees and core organizational units at all levels must prepare especially carefully, using every opportunity to mobilize the Democratic League and the action factions of the Farmers' and Workers' Democratic Party, especially for action factions and the various organizations of the Three People's Principles factions, establish closer ties. Standing committees and cores in various regions regularly send representatives to attend meetings of cadres from the Democratic League, the Three Associations, and the action factions in various regions, and report the situation of their various meetings and individual actions to the Central Bureau through couriers, as a review of the allocation of forces. (5) Utilize the upper-level relationships of the Association for Promoting Democracy and the Democratic National Construction Association in Hong Kong, Shanghai, Chengdu, and Chongqing to help expand the party's transportation network so that party announcements can be quickly transmitted to various regions, but this must be done with the condition of protecting one's own secrets. (6) The Political Bureau must dispatch special envoys to preside over the allocation of various action tasks in various regions and special zones, or be directed by the bureau committee of the branch bureau. At the same time, regional committees and special zone committees must regularly (at least once a month) send representatives to the central area to attend meetings and must achieve close contact between the central area, local areas, and special zones. Regarding the use of letters, instructions, announcements, telegrams, and all methods used by special envoys dispatched by the Central Bureau in the future, direct (A) couriers will notify them at any time, and communication networks must be used to the greatest extent possible. Local relationships must be used to enable the party's local area leading comrades to quickly and thoroughly know the events that are maturing between them, so that local areas can prepare for new struggles. (7) The strategy of isolating compromise factions and rebel factions, dividing and absorbing their lower-level cadres, plays a very important role in the new struggle. In the three regions of Beijing, Shanghai, and Hong Kong, and in the various industrial centers, it is especially necessary to strengthen its application, and to quickly form propaganda groups to go to various parties and "Minxiao" (referring to the Kuomintang and the government), various institutions, among workers, in yellow unions, especially in various transportation agencies, to spread terror messages and the policies of our party. Propagandists in various regions must be periodically transferred to receive new and strict training (limited to party members) to strengthen the application of new policies. (8) Under the current situation, "Minxiao" is unlikely to take high-pressure tactics against the leaders of the Democratic League, and they should make full use of their local resources and the potential of social relationships in various regions to specifically prevent the great unity of the reactionary side and the approach of the middle factions to "Minxiao." In a positive aspect, it is to absorb their cadres and seize leadership, highly develop our core and the deepening of our policies. In action, we must accommodate, tolerate, and strive for consistency with the various intermediate factions of the Democratic League, create a unified policy alliance, and further promote the great unity of democratic factions and intermediate factions nationwide, to form a national alliance to overthrow the ruling power of the four major families. The principle of this great unity, great alliance, and general mobilization is anti-Chiang and peaceful reunification. This kind of democratic great unity can achieve initial victories, which will reduce the difficulties for the revolutionary proletariat and other laborers in establishing democratic unity. (9) The party's propaganda groups and core, through "Minxiao," the Social Democratic Party, and the Youth League, should take united action inside and outside to seize their lower-level cadres and divide their organizations, so that many of their ordinary party members abandon their trust in their leaders and promote their participation in the policies of the Democratic League, the Three Associations, and the Democratic National Construction Association. This is the joint bridge of the people's revolution that can be created in the new struggle, and it is also one of the key and main tasks of the nationwide anti-four major families.

Establish Guerrilla Corps

Military Aspects: (1) Unify local armed forces, organize and establish a Guerrilla Corps Headquarters, expand popular uprisings, and armed uprisings, so that the "Minxiao Bandit Army" disperses its forces and increases its defense. (2) All local armed organizations, armed work teams, militia self-defense forces, worker-peasant armed teams, and guerrilla commando teams shall operate under the unified command of the Guerrilla Corps Headquarters. (3) In the "Minxiao" areas, quickly establish armed popular uprising commands in various villages and towns. Each department and branch should allocate forces and formulate plans, using armed work teams, commando battalions, and snipers to occupy decisive locations in response to popular uprisings. However, before launching an uprising, it is necessary to pay meticulous attention to collecting information from all aspects of the people about the actions, components, and deployments of the "White Bandit" troops stationed in the area, and their atrocities against the people. If this kind of arrangement is not made, it will become a laughable stupidity. We absolutely do not want beautiful resolutions or actions without certainty. (4) For ordinary armed popular uprising actions in the "Minxiao" areas, proceed according to the following resolutions of the Central Political Bureau and the Revolutionary Military Commission: (A) No matter when or where, do not treat armed popular uprisings as child's play. Avoid repeating the erroneous lines of the past "Autumn Harvest Uprising" and "National Urban Uprising," but know that from the beginning of the uprising, it must be carried out to the end. (B) A popular uprising is like a kind of war. The party committee, the headquarters, and the military transport committee must carefully review it when preparing to launch it. Create a popular uprising situation, determine the popular uprising situation, and create various conditions for the popular uprising action.

Strengthen the Authority of Military Party Committees at All Levels. In order to transform the military situation into a comprehensive revolutionary military struggle, the Central Political Bureau and the Military Commission believe that it is necessary to strengthen discipline and ideological unity, correct military command, and the unity of military actions, and decide on the authority of military party committees at all levels as follows: A. Military party committees at all levels have absolute authority over individual instructions and military orders issued to various military regions, army groups, and commanders. Those who violate this will be executed. B. Instructions and military orders issued by commanders of military regions and army groups at all levels are absolutely invalid without the countersignature of the party committee. C. When there are discrepancies between the military actions of commanders and party committees at all levels, the party's decision must be followed. D. In cases of urgent necessity, party committees at all levels have the right to detain and remove armed commanders and unit commanders first, and then report to higher levels. Those who violate this will be executed. E. Political departments and instructors at all levels are directly subordinate to the party committee, military region commanders, and commanders at all levels, and may not interfere with their work.

Sabotage Telecommunications

Regarding the tasks of military party committees at all levels in underground struggle: (1) Military party committees at all levels must thoroughly implement the "Three Main Rules of Discipline" and the "Eight Points for Attention" in all units. (2) War is determined by strengthening the struggle, and even more so by the loyal combat of soldiers who hold weapons. Therefore, the party's activities in various units must be centered on soldiers and based on small groups. (3) Regarding armed popular uprising assaults, it is necessary to determine the key to victory or defeat, and in the location that determines victory or defeat, gather a force far exceeding the enemy's, because otherwise, the popular uprising armed forces will be eliminated by the enemy with better weapons. (4) To achieve success in an armed mutiny uprising, it is necessary to vigorously launch attacks on telephone bureaus, telegraph operators, railway stations, and various river-crossing bridges. (5) Occupying various transportation agencies and transportation hubs, and large-scale destruction of railway tracks and overturning of vehicles, is to enable the insurgents to use these agency tools to isolate the armed forces of the "White Party Bandit Army." (6) Universally destroying railway tracks on the eve of the uprising is of great significance. Occupying bridges and destroying roads, and changing the terrain, is of extreme importance for the connection between the uprising center and the valley edge area.

### Many Rice Shops in Hangzhou are Smashed; High Prices with No Goods Incite Public Anger; Municipal Government Decides to Release 2,000 Shi Starting Today

[Our Newspaper, Hangzhou, 2nd] Today, Hangzhou City is completely in a state of chaos. Due to the ineffectiveness of the city's efforts to suppress rice prices, the 127,000-portion ration of rice is available at a price but with no goods, and the black market price has risen to 260,000, which has incited public anger, similar to the typhoon smashing last March, it has spread throughout the city. Only a very small portion of the more than 300 large and small rice shops have been spared. Even the police station was attacked. The situation did not subside from morning to dusk, and it was more intense than last year. In the morning, impoverished citizens purchased rationed rice everywhere but found nothing. Wandering on the streets, gathering in groups, the resentment turned into venting on rice shops. Initially, they rushed into Zhang Kunyuan's Daxing Grain Shop and Jufengnian Grain Shop on Qingchun Street, the director of the Hangzhou Grain Industry Association. They found that the former had over 2,000 bags of rice stored, and the latter had over 1,000 bags. So they shouted "Smash, smash!" For a time, white rice was scattered everywhere, and property was destroyed. The poor people rushed home with rice using baskets, sacks, and clothes. Some of the crowd then scattered to Caishi Bridge and other places on the street, smashing rice shops along the way. The smashing sound started and resonated everywhere. By noon, areas such as Hou Dong Street Road, Jitai Road, Gulou Wai Dingsi Bridge, and even Gongchen Bridge in the suburbs, were like madmen, smashing rice shops on a large scale. Even with the suppression of military police, they were unable to do anything. The rice merchants then supplied rice for sale as much as possible. As a result, not only was the rationed rice released, but even high-quality white rice was lowered to 100,000 per shi, and the shops were spared from being smashed. Among them, the Daxing Grain Shop suffered greater losses. In addition to the rice in the store, more than 3,000 bags of white rice in the warehouse next to the Provincial Party Headquarters, as well as flour, soybeans, and miscellaneous grains, were all robbed, and it did not stop until late at night. In addition, more than 1,000 bags each were taken from Juyuanxin Grain Shop, Yongtaireng Rice Shop, the Four Banks and Two Bureaus warehouse, Dahua Xieji, Shengtian Xie, and other places. The police station initially planned to suppress it, but it was ineffective. Police Chief Shen Pu went to inspect the scene and was surrounded by the crowd on Wushan Road and was beaten. The police station arrested two people as a result, and then the crowd flocked to the bustling area, and the Second Branch Bureau was smashed a lot, and the rice milling factory was also destroyed, resulting in significant losses. In addition, poor people at the Great Hotel robbed military rice, causing gunfire, resulting in three soldiers being injured. At 7 p.m., the municipal government convened an emergency meeting and decided to release 2,000 shi starting on the 3rd, with each person limited to purchasing 5 sheng, and resolved: (1) The provincial and municipal governments should take effective measures to maintain social order and issue an announcement to reassure the people. (2) The rice industry association should still find ways to resume operations and should be protected by the government. (3) The losses this time were very large, and the provincial and municipal governments should investigate the facts and discuss appropriate solutions. (4) The municipal government should handle price control and offer rice at a fair price to the market to avoid panic. (5) The municipal government should, together with the Civilian Food Purchase and Sales Committee, request the Four Banks Joint Office to quickly allocate huge sums of money to purchase grain. (6) The difference between the grain-producing areas and the rice market in this city should be asked for the Ministry of Food to allocate a portion from the surplus funds in the existing grain and the price stabilization fund, and the provincial and municipal governments should quickly mediate labor disputes. If there are strikes or slowdowns, they should be immediately persuaded to resume work.

Zhou Xiangxian Reports to the Provincial Assembly, Councilors Raise Questions

After inspecting various places, the reporter went to the provincial government to visit the provincial authorities. At that time, Chairman Shen was discussing the causes and remedies of the turmoil with Secretary-General Lei. Then, Secretary-General Lei, on behalf of Chairman Shen, went to the municipal government to meet Mayor Zhou and to report to the Provincial Assembly. The reporter was invited to go in the same car. Mayor Zhou said that the Hangzhou City's disposal of rice and grain had been handled very well and that there should be no more rice shop smashing. According to the usual practice of calming down the last turmoil, martial law should be imposed. At this time, Chairman Shen received a phone call and went to the provincial government again. It was decided to convene the Civilian Food Purchase and Sales Committee at 7 p.m. on the 2nd to discuss the continued operation of rice shops and the prevention of the expansion of the smashing trend, while temporarily preparing to prevent villains from mixing in and taking the opportunity to cause trouble. Then, Secretary-General Lei, Mayor Zhou, the reporter, and others went to the Provincial Assembly in the same car. The meeting was discussing another issue. Speaker Zhang Qiang announced the cessation of the discussion and Mayor Zhou reported instead. As soon as the report began, Councilor Yu Shaosong asked why the rice price was allowed to rise so high? Just as Mayor Zhou was about to reply, Councilor Liao Jia asked where the 1,000 dan of rice released by the Four Banks was allocated each day? Lu Bingpu immediately asked, "I don't know what the government's control measures are for rice merchants?" Jin Yueguang continued, "Martial law is not the solution." Zheng Bangxian said: "Today's turmoil is caused by the government's excessive trust in rice merchants." Shi Yan said: "Today, in addition to seeing rice shops being smashed, I also saw the masses gathering in front of this council, and I learned that the Director and Deputy Director of the Provincial Field and Grain Office and the Director of the Hangzhou Rice Industry Association were hoarding rice in partnership. The masses detected it and smashed it at their hoarding place. May I ask the mayor if this is true?" Later, Xu Ziliang, Jin Yueguang, Zhou Yangsong, and others raised questions one after another. Mayor Zhou, in order to deal with the aftermath of the turmoil, accepted the suggestions and left. Then, Secretary-General Lei was invited to report, and the councilors raised questions again.

(3) The price of legal currency for currency conversion should be divided into districts based on the proximity of provincial transportation and economic conditions, and the prices should be verified separately. (4) The standard for field tax collection should be flexible, with the principle of allocating enough for the central quota. (5) The field tax for the 36th year should be converted according to the regular tax of the 26th year, and all surcharges should be removed so that the people's burden can be averaged, and the military grain needs and local finances will not be affected.

### 社論　國內局勢的新展望

Editorial: New Prospects for the Domestic Situation

At the Legislative Yuan meeting the day before yesterday, the newly appointed Premier Zhang Qun attended to report on the future policy objectives, saying: "We will make efforts from all sides to bring the military measures taken by the government due to the suppression of the rebellion to a swift end, so that we can fundamentally resolve the domestic disputes with political methods and restore the goal of unification as soon as possible." Furthermore, he said: "The current economy is extremely difficult, which has a significant impact on the national economy and the people's livelihood. We must strive to balance revenue and expenditure and minimize the difference between the two. At the same time, we must also strive to consolidate the currency... abide by the spirit of the constitution, protect the people's freedom, and severely punish corruption..." All of the above is concise and to the point, and the scope it encompasses is extremely broad, which is truly worthy of deep reflection by the general public. Premier Zhang's report, although made to the Legislative Yuan, can also be said to be addressed to the people through the Legislative Yuan. His report and answers, whether related to the political situation, the current difficulties of the national economy, or our country's international relations, were all able to be succinctly clarified. His demeanor was humble and did not lose the style of a statesman, which gave the people a good impression. According to news reports, there was more criticism of the established national policy than questions about how to implement the national policy. The question of "whether unification or peace should come first" was particularly heated, and there was a desire for "the Executive Yuan to devote 50% of its efforts to addressing the issue of peaceful unification." The situation was heated, as one can imagine.

Due to this meeting of the Legislative Yuan, we have even higher expectations for the development of the domestic situation in the future. What we find gratifying is that in addition to Premier Zhang, the Vice Premier, Minister of Defense, Minister of Finance, Minister of Communications, and heads of relevant ministries and commissions attended the Legislative Yuan meeting. The large number of Executive Yuan attendees seems unprecedented. In addition, Premier Zhang's conciliatory attitude and the Legislative Yuan members' enthusiastic speeches fully demonstrate the improvement in the relationship between the legislative and executive branches. It can be seen that the executive and legislative branches will be in a mutually supportive position in the future and will not repeat the mistakes of the past. This is something that the people of the country can be pleased about. Legislation and rule-making are originally the purview of the Legislative Yuan, while how laws and regulations are used and implemented is the responsibility of the executive branch. The legislative and executive branches should be mutually supportive and regarded as one. However, due to the lack of proper relations in the past, a gulf has arisen between the legislative and executive branches, which is truly regrettable. Now, the executive branch is changing its past habits and establishing a democratic and constitutional style. The closer relationship between the legislative and executive branches in the future will naturally be of great benefit to the national economy and the people's livelihood.

Whether military first, political first, or economic first, the current domestic situation is, as Premier Zhang said, related to all three and difficult to separate. Although the Executive Yuan under the current system is not the highest decision-making body for national policy, it holds the great power of national governance. As a department of the government, its significance in the political aspect seems to be limited to the implementation of national policy and general administration. The Premier of the Executive Yuan may be able to undertake some tasks that do not belong to the Executive Yuan in nature. The undertaking of these tasks is outside the law and, strictly speaking, is not his responsibility. Therefore, the so-called "new Executive Yuan is a political government, and we hope that it can devote 80% of its efforts to seeking the realization of peaceful unification," although it holds twelve points of sincerity for the country and the people, it always feels somewhat strained and close to overstepping the bounds of propriety. As for peaceful unification and unified peace, although the arrangement of this sequence is of great importance, it seems that it is not necessary to raise it again today. After the failure of peaceful unification, there was then the decision of unified peace. Since the national policy has been set, unification has not rejected peace. Raising this issue again at this time seems to lack consideration in terms of political wisdom. There is no one in the country who does not hope for peace, and the same is true for the government. When we read Premier Zhang's report, "We will make efforts from all sides to bring the military measures taken by the government due to the suppression of the rebellion to a swift end, so that we can fundamentally resolve the domestic disputes with political methods and restore the goal of unification as soon as possible," we can see the government's sincerity. Even when it is forced to use military force, it still hopes that the military measures can be brought to a swift end, so that it can fundamentally resolve the domestic disputes with political methods and restore the goal of unification as soon as possible. We welcome the expression of this attitude, which is truly the highest manifestation of a spirit of forbearance.

However, what the general public hopes for from the new government at the moment is naturally how it can alleviate the economic difficulties they are experiencing. The unresolved military and political situation certainly cannot completely solve the current economic situation, but the current economic situation also cannot wait until the military and political situation is resolved before thinking of solutions. While it may take time to address the root cause, there must be some measures to address the symptoms. Therefore, from the perspective of the general public, what the people hope for from the government is a reduction in economic difficulties more than anything else, because it is directly related to their own interests, so their expectations are even greater. Judging from the current situation, the core of this economic problem seems to revolve around the implementation of the emergency economic plan. As Premier Zhang said, the implementation of this plan has indeed achieved considerable results. If this plan had not been proposed at the time, it seems that the current economic situation would not be possible. However, there are also some facts before us that deserve our attention. Taking the price of rice alone, it has risen from more than 60,000 yuan when the plan was implemented to more than 300,000 yuan in just over two months. The speed of the increase is unprecedented. This shows that the government's control over prices has not been effective due to the implementation of the emergency economic plan; on the contrary, prices have soared due to the implementation of this plan. Since prices cannot be frozen, what can be frozen is only wages and salaries. Under this unbalanced development, it will inevitably lead to serious social unrest. In addition, although the black market prices of gold and foreign exchange are not seen in newspapers, the existence of black market prices seems undeniable. According to today's situation, the current economic difficulties seem to be even greater than they were when the economic plan was issued. We hope that the government can quickly come up with a way to alleviate the current economic difficulties.

At the beginning of his tenure, Premier Zhang stated that economic problems should be solved with economic methods. At the meeting of the Legislative Yuan, he also said: The emergency economic measures, although very effective in overcoming the economic crisis in February of this year, are no longer sufficient to cope with the current economic situation. The government authorities are reviewing them and then deciding whether to modify or abolish them. This is truly a correct reading. Economic phenomena are originally governed by economic laws. We can temporarily use political power to control economic changes, but such control cannot last long, and the effectiveness of it is also a question. Regarding the current economic crisis, we hope that the measures that the government comes up with will no longer repeat the mistakes of the past in placing too much emphasis on political power. Only when the economic difficulties are gradually alleviated and the people's lives are more stable will the development of the nation have a real future. This is truly a major test for the current government.

### 聯合國大會通過　設立聖地調查會　猶代表可獲准陳述意見

The United Nations General Assembly Passes Resolution to Establish Holy Land Investigation Committee, Jewish Representatives May Be Permitted to State Opinions

[United Press, New York, 1st] The Arab countries' request for this special session of the United Nations General Assembly to discuss the end of the British Mandate and declare the independence of Palestine has failed. The Assembly today rejected it by a vote of 24 to 15, with 10 abstentions. Chairman Aranha instructed the committee to meet tomorrow morning to decide whether to allow Jewish representatives to participate in the issue, and submit it to the General Assembly for review in the afternoon. Today's afternoon meeting lasted four and a half hours. The Arab countries knew from the beginning that their struggle was hopeless, but they continued to argue endlessly. The General Assembly finally included the British proposal to establish a fact-finding committee on the agenda.

[Associated Press, New York, 1st] The United States today suddenly changed its attitude and no longer opposes the participation of Jews in the UN General Assembly's special meeting to discuss the Palestinian issue, and is looking for ways to allow Jewish representatives to participate. This is clearly the result of repeated appeals from the Jewish Congress to President Truman to urge the State Department to change its position. However, Britain has not changed its position, and the strategies taken by the United Kingdom and United States are now showing signs of divergence for the first time.

[United Press, New York, 2nd] The United Kingdom and the United States have different opinions on whether to allow Jewish representatives to attend the UN General Assembly's discussion of the Palestinian issue. The General Assembly Steering Committee met today to discuss the matter, and it is likely that Jewish representatives will be allowed to attend in some capacity. It is reported that US representative Austin will propose to allow Jewish representatives to speak at the 55-nation Political Committee, but without the right to vote. This committee is a disguised form of the General Assembly, and all major issues must be reviewed by it before being submitted to the General Assembly for a vote. However, Britain has stated that it is prepared to oppose this. Another US proposal is to set up a special committee for Jewish representatives to attend and speak, and then submit a report to the Political Committee. This would avoid setting a precedent for allowing non-member states to attend. Britain is said to be considering this. However, the Jewish Congress has stated that it will not attend a committee organized by a small number of countries unless it is allowed to speak before all 55 nations. Britain will only allow Jewish representatives to state their opinions to the Palestinian issue investigation committee.

[Reuters, New York, 2nd] The "New York Times" reported that the United Nations organization expects that the General Assembly will decide to send a committee to Palestine and has booked 65 berths on the US ship "Sea Carp," which is scheduled to leave the United States early next month.

### 貝文論世界和平　以耐心及期望勗勉國人

Bevin Discusses World Peace, Encourages Citizens with Patience and Hope

[Reuters, London, 1st] Foreign Secretary Bevin, in a speech to a Labour Party meeting in his constituency, spoke of the Moscow Conference and encouraged people with patience and hope. Bevin said: "I believe that all the issues are serious issues, so rather than hastily establish a peace that is not genuine, it is better to spend more time establishing a good peace. This issue, although only a German or European issue, has an impact on the entire world peace. If we establish a bad compromise, it will cause the world to embark on the wrong path again, thus making a big mistake that will harm future generations." Bevin went on to describe the situation in the European countries formerly occupied by Germany, saying that the mortality rate in those countries was very high. When he passed through Poland, the Polish Prime Minister told him that Poland previously had a population of 35 million, but today it only has 22 million. The city of Warsaw is only a skeleton, and the center of the city was completely burned down, deliberately destroyed by the Nazis before their retreat. In other parts of Europe, the entire economy has also been destroyed. Bevin said: "There will inevitably be many difficulties in rebuilding these countries. The politicians of these countries must put down their swords and establish peace. And when making peace, they must ensure that their children will never fight each other again in the future." He said that although he was disappointed in Moscow, he did not feel impatient.

Contents of Bevin-Stalin Talks Not Disclosed by Officials

[Agence France-Presse, London, 1st] Regarding Foreign Secretary Bevin's talks with Marshal Stalin in Moscow, a spokesman for the British Foreign Office refused to disclose the contents today, saying only that a British reporter had called to say that Marshal Stalin had no objection to Britain regarding the Ruhr area as a "conquered province" and forcibly conscripting German workers. This statement is not true. Marshal Stalin only stated that he understood that Britain was forced to force Germans to work.

[Agence France-Presse, London, 1st] Foreign Secretary Bevin attended a cabinet meeting today after returning from Moscow to report on the Four Powers Foreign Ministers Conference. In addition, former Prime Minister Churchill today asked the House of Commons to discuss foreign policy, but Privy Councilor Morrison has not been able to determine the date for the discussion of foreign policy.

Eden Strongly Advocates Close Cooperation Between Britain and the United States

[Reuters, Birmingham, 1st] Former British War Secretary Eden, in a speech to young Conservative Party members here, said that the failure of the Moscow Conference could stimulate the work of German unification. The merger of the British and American zones may be extended to the French zone in the future. Eden also said: "The United States has a major task in Europe, which is now obvious. If the United Kingdom wishes to maintain its proper leadership position in Europe, politicians from the United Kingdom and the United States must establish a close understanding. The door to full cooperation with our Soviet Union allies remains open forever. We have now reached true global unity. There is no way to maintain lasting peace other than this."

### Key Points of the United Nations Military Staff Committee's Work Report

[Central News Agency, New York, 1st Dispatch] The work report that the United Nations Military Staff Committee, established over a year ago, has been slow to submit, has finally been submitted to its superior body, the Security Council. The Security Council has decided to publicly announce this 90-page report on the 3rd. According to unofficial sources, the report is divided into four parts and forty-two sections. The four parts are (1) Introduction, (2) Main Body of the Report, (3) Appendix, explaining the recommendations on which no agreement could be reached, (4) Another Appendix, including the opinions of the delegation. Among the forty-two sections, it is reported that agreement was reached on sixteen sections, opinions differed on sixteen sections, and it is said that there were more sections on which no agreement was reached than on which agreement was reached. However, the Military Staff Committee has agreed that the troops of each country should be commanded by their own national officers, who have the right to report to their own governments, and that the supreme commander should be selected by the Security Council. Regarding the issue of the supreme commander, it is reported that in the appendix to the report, France's opinion is that the Security Council should also select the commanders-in-chief of the land, sea, and air forces under the command of the United Nations supreme commander. The most important facts on which no agreement was reached are as follows:

(1) The size of the future United Nations army and the ratio of military quotas allocated to major and small countries; (2) Whether the seven major powers should provide exactly the same troops and equipment to several countries; (3) The method of obtaining permission from the various United Nations countries for the United Nations army to use their bases and facilities. Other unresolved issues include the repatriation of troops from various countries after aggression has been stopped, where troops from various countries should be stationed while awaiting orders from the Security Council, and how they should be supplied by their home countries. It is expected that the representative of the country that contributes the most to the international army will be selected as the supreme commander, but this matter still awaits the resolution of differences of opinion among the Soviet Union and other member countries regarding the organization of the future international army. Judging from the Staff Committee's report, the prospects for the establishment of an international army are extremely dim. This is not only because the member countries have not changed their determination that they cannot use an international army to suppress military conflicts, including those involving the five major powers. However, it is said that in view of the current unstable international situation and the differences of opinion among the major powers, the fact that the Staff Committee was able to draft a report is itself a success.

Notice: "Full Text of Marshall's Speech," continuation will be published on page 7 tomorrow.

### Authority Reintroduces Old Case of Commuted Labor Service Fee Decides to Have the Bureau of Public Works, Social Affairs Bureau, and Civil Affairs Office Draft Measures, City Government Expects to Collect 56 Billion

[Report from this newspaper] The commuted labor service fee for national compulsory labor, which was once rejected by the City Council, was brought up for discussion again at yesterday's municipal administration meeting. The plan and implementation measures will be drafted by the Bureau of Public Works in conjunction with the Social Affairs Bureau and the Civil Affairs Office. This reporter made a special visit to Zhao Zukang, Director of the Bureau of Public Works, last night. According to him, the draft plan will not go beyond the following three principles: (1) What form? According to the decision of last year, the method of commutation will be adopted. According to the central government's regulations, all able-bodied men must perform ten days of compulsory service for the country each year, and those who do not provide labor may commute it with cash. The city has a total population of more than four million, and the number of able-bodied men is estimated to be one-fifth of the total population, that is, 800,000. If based on the current wage of temporary workers employed by the Bureau of Public Works, which averages about 7,000 yuan per day, then ten days would be 70,000 yuan, and the total amount of national labor service commutation fees that the city government could collect would be about 56 billion. However, according to Director Zhao, in addition to the method of collecting commutation fees, it is also planned to refer to the current method of conscripting labor by district for dredging rivers in the bureau. Because the achievements of the river dredging projects in the Zhenru, Jiangwan, Pudong, and Longhua districts of the city are good, the method of conscripting labor by district will also be considered. (2) What kind of work? The scope of work will not go beyond water conservancy and roads. According to Director Zhao, if labor is conscripted by district, construction will begin in order of priority according to the needs of each district. If the method of commutation fees is adopted uniformly throughout the city, then the progress of work should be equal in each district, so that the interests of all citizens of the city are equal. (3) What kind of organization? In Nanjing, a National Compulsory Labor Committee has already been organized to specialize in this matter. Whether a committee will also be established in this city or a labor service agency will be established will be discussed with the Social Affairs Bureau and the Civil Affairs Office. After the draft plan and implementation measures are prepared, they will be submitted to the third general meeting of the City Council for decision.

### Four Rice Merchants Punished

### Zhongyong Foreign Firm Illegal Case Transferred to District Prosecutor's Office for Interrogation

[Report from this newspaper] Zhongyong Foreign Firm in the Citibank Building on Jiujiang Road was paying in US dollars to buy American stocks, which violated the law.

### Police Department Investigates Kangyuan Bank

[Report from this newspaper] According to a tip-off received by the economic section of the police department, Kangyuan Bank at No. 6, Tianlun Building, No. 306 Nanjing Road, was engaging in black market gold and currency transactions.

The manager of the bank, Wu Boxuan, was not present, and the employee Wang Guoting is being interrogated by the police department.

### Discussing with Labor Union Representatives to Improve Employee Life, Gathering Opinions

[Report from this newspaper] Minister Gu of the Ministry of Social Affairs told reporters yesterday: After consulting with both labor and management in Shanghai on the issue of improving employee life, I will discuss the matter again with the city government and the Ministry of Social Affairs, and then submit a comprehensive plan to the central government for adoption. Mr. Gu summoned the heads of the General Labor Union and various labor unions yesterday morning to give instructions, explaining in detail the current economic crisis and the central government's policies, saying that the government is determined to protect the minimum living standards of workers, but at the same time must take into account the future of industry. Otherwise, there will be no intact eggs under an overturned nest. Only under the existence of the national economy can class interests exist. From 4:00 PM onwards, Mr. Gu gathered more than 20 senior officials from the General Labor Union and various labor unions at Wu Kaixian's residence to exchange opinions on the issue of improving the lives of workers. The labor representatives suggested conditionally restoring the cost-of-living index wage system, which Mr. Gu believed was reasonable because it could take into account the interests of both labor and management. In the evening, Director Wu hosted a banquet to discuss measures to provide relief to unemployed workers. At 10:00 PM, Wu Yunzhu, Tian Heqing, Hu Boxiang, and other standing directors of the General Association of Chinese Industries visited together. The representatives said that the principles of the Industrial Association Law were passed by the Tenth Plenary Session of the Central Committee more than four years ago, but the full text is still under review by the Executive Yuan. They hoped that Minister Gu would relay the industry's hopes to the central government so that the legislative process could be completed as soon as possible. Mr. Gu will meet with representatives of the industry today and then take the night train back to Nanjing.

### City Council Held First District Government Symposium Yesterday District Heads and Representatives All Put Forward Reviews Based on Actual Needs

Minister Gu Scheduled to Return to Nanjing Tonight

[Report from this newspaper] The City Council held its first district government symposium yesterday. The chairmen of the district people's representative assemblies and the district heads and deputy district heads of Huangpu, Laoza, Xincheng, and Jing'an districts, including Jiang Zhaohu, Liu Xiexun, Ren Jinping, and Lou Yunmei, attended the meeting, which was personally presided over by Speaker Pan. The chairmen of the district people's representative assemblies and the district heads earnestly put forward reviews based on their actual needs.

Strengthening Contact and Coordinating Opinions

Regarding the district people's representative assemblies: (1) It is hoped that the city councilors elected in each district will strengthen contact with the district people's representative assemblies, and that the councilors will attend the meetings of the district people's representative assemblies. (2) The funding for the district people's representative assemblies is only 32,000 yuan per month, and it is hoped that this will be increased immediately and that they will be allowed to employ full-time staff. (3) It is requested that the Civil Affairs Office of the City Government convene a working meeting of the chairmen of the valley district people's representative assemblies once a month. (4) Some matters, such as road construction, can originally be initiated by each district independently, with the Bureau of Public Works providing technical assistance and guidance, using the district's own resources to complete the work. (5) The power of the district people's representative assemblies to oversee the finances of the district is not expressly stipulated, but there are regulations for each district to raise its own business expenses. This seems to be a legislative oversight, and it should be recommended that the central government quickly supplement the regulations.

Mediation Committees Not Taken Seriously

The opinions of the district heads are as follows: (1) The powers of the district offices should be clearly defined. (2) The district mediation committees have not yet obtained legal status, so the courts do not take the results of mediation seriously, and the people have no faith in the mediation committees. It should be immediately recommended that the central government stipulate their legal status. (3) The matter of contributing to schools to celebrate birthdays should be initiated as soon as possible to avoid being affected by fluctuations in prices again, and the procedures for allocating public land should be simplified. (4) The status of the Baojia heads should be respected by the higher-level government agencies and should not be regarded as slaves.

After listening to everyone's opinions, Speaker Pan said: For those that can be immediately handed over to the relevant agencies for handling, this council is willing to immediately forward the request for handling on their behalf. Those that need to be studied at length will be submitted to the third general meeting of this council for discussion.

### Planning to Strengthen Anti-Smoking Work, Preparing to Establish a Model Rehabilitation Institute

In order to strengthen the city's rehabilitation work, a model rehabilitation institute will be established immediately, and appropriate anti-smoking films will be adopted for publicity.

### Further Hearing in the Enemy Support Case of Zhou Manhua's Husband

[Report from this newspaper] Wu Guozhang, the husband of former movie star Zhou Manhua, was accused of supporting the enemy with cotton. The High Court continued to hear the case yesterday, summoning Zhang Xueling, the accountant of Maochang Cotton Store, and Peng Yougen, the manager of Pudong Limin Yarn Factory, as witnesses. Zhang testified that Maochang was a partnership company, with Wu Guoxin as the general manager, and the defendant was only the manager. As for doing business with Yoshida Foreign Firm, it was purely a commercial transaction. Peng said that Maochang Cotton Store, opened by Wu and others, did not collect cotton for the Japanese, because the factory site was in the hinterland of Pudong, more than a hundred li away from the riverbank, and there were often guerrillas出沒, so the Japanese army did not dare to go there. He did not know the rest of the situation. The court hearing lasted a long time. Because one witness in the case had not yet arrived, it was adjourned for another hearing.

### Claiming that Death by Reverse Expression Would Allow One to Die with Peace of Mind, New Evidence Insufficient to Adopt, High Court Rules to Reject

[Report from this newspaper] After Fu Shishuo, the former pseudo-governor of Zhejiang Province, was sentenced to death, he applied to the High Court for a retrial. The High Court has now ruled to reject the application. The reason for the ruling is roughly as follows: The new evidence presented in this application for a retrial (referring to the rescue of underground workers Mao [blank], Shen Xiaomei), cannot affect the confirmed judgment. After reviewing the case, the defendant was a high-ranking pseudo-official and an important member of the pseudo-central government. Unless he is sentenced to capital punishment, it will not be enough to serve as a warning. As for his wife, Chuan Zhang [blank], listing Luo Junqiang and Chen Chunguo as examples in the statement, the circumstances of each person's crime are different and difficult to compare. It is insufficient to adopt the request for a retrial, and it should be rejected and not allowed.

### High Prosecutor's Office Indicts Four Suspected Traitors, Li Xiaobin Gained Wealth by Opening Gambling Dens, Li Quanshi Was Devoid of National Integrity, Zhang Jixin and Huang Zuoqing Both Increased Their Submission to the Enemy

[Report from this newspaper] Li Xiaobao, one of the maritime bullies during the enemy-puppet period, has now been indicted by the High Prosecutor's Office on suspicion of treason. The indictment states: After Shanghai fell, Li entered the door of Lu Ying of the pseudo-police station and also worshiped his third concubine as his adoptive mother, serving as a detective of the pseudo-police station and deputy director of the special service office. He opened a Western-style gambling den and became rich in a few years. After the victory, he fled and was reported by a person named Quan Chenshi. His actions clearly constitute the crimes under Article 2, Paragraph 1, Item 1 and Article 3 of the Regulations on Punishing Traitors. It is said that Li is currently hiding in Hong Kong.

Li Quanshi served in the education sector in Shanghai before the war and enjoyed the reputation of being an authoritative economic scholar. However, he lacked national integrity and participated in pseudo-organizations, successively serving as the director of the pseudo-economic research institute, a consultant to the pseudo-Shanghai municipal government, and a member of the pseudo-national economic committee. After the victory, he fled without a trace. The Teacher Appraisal Committee of Shanghai District Colleges and Universities of the Ministry of Education reported the matter to the Ministry of Education, which forwarded it to the Ministry of Justice for investigation by the High Prosecutor's Office. After investigation by the High Prosecutor's Office, it was determined that the defendant's crimes were obvious and constituted the crime under Article 2, Paragraph 1, Item 1 of the Regulations on Punishing Traitors. A public prosecution has been filed.

Zhang Jixin, who served as a professor at Jida University before the war, was also indicted by the High Prosecutor's Office on suspicion of treason for taking the position of director of the education department of the pseudo-Central University after submitting to the enemy.

Huang Zuoqing was a henchman of Ding Mocun, successively serving as a specialist in the pseudo-Social Movement Promotion Association, a secretary in the pseudo-Ministry of Social Welfare, and the pseudo-county magistrate of Haining County and executive committee member of the pseudo-county party department, extorting and plundering without restraint. The Ministry of Justice approved the Intelligence Order of the Central Bureau of Statistics and Investigation to be issued to the High Prosecutor's Office for investigation. The High Prosecutor's Office investigated the Haining County government and found that the reply was generally the same. The High Prosecutor's Office has filed a public prosecution on suspicion of treason.

### Trial of Pseudo-Police Chief Gao Linsen Concluded

[Report from this newspaper] Gao Linsen, from Shandong, was accused of having served as a translator for the enemy's Uchida Unit and the Oshima Unit, a major secretary in the Shanghai Office of the 34th Pseudo-Army Division, and a police chief in the Pseudo-Shanghai Municipal Police Department. He was retained after the victory. Because his wife was over thirty years old, he sent out a large number of invitation cards, and someone filed a complaint with the District Court. The District Court discovered a curriculum vitae form during the trial of the case. Because he had held pseudo-positions in the past, he was suspected of being a traitor, so he was transferred to the High Court for handling. Gao claimed during the trial yesterday, "The above-mentioned pseudo-positions were actually fabricated in the resume when I applied for the position of police chief in the pseudo-police department and are not reliable." The court ordered the trial to be concluded and scheduled the sentencing for the 9th.

### Road Bureau's Various Plans Difficult to Realize Due to Economic Constraints

[Report from this newspaper] Chen Bozhuang, the director of the Two Road Bureaus, went to Nanjing on official business at the end of last month. When he returned to Shanghai yesterday morning, he met with this reporter and said that the restoration plan formulated by the bureau was completed last month. However, new construction plans are difficult to realize in the current situation due to limited funding and difficulties in applying for foreign exchange. Although Mr. Chen denied that his trip to Nanjing was to apply for subsidies or increase fares, he pointed out that it is a great regret that the traffic congestion caused by the low freight and ticket prices cannot be improved. Mr. Chen expressed his views on the future work of the bureau, saying, "Do as much as you can with the money you have." Under the current economic conditions, it is already difficult to maintain the status quo, and the various plans that have been formulated can only be shelved.

### Mao Dun and Wife Return from Soviet Union, Two Associations Host Tea Party Welcome

### Liu Jingyi Discusses Future Civil Aviation Plans: Developing Border Province Transportation, Opening International Air Routes, No Matter the Cost

[Our Newspaper] Liu Jingyi, the newly appointed General Manager of China National Aviation Corporation, assumed office the day before yesterday. Yesterday, he spoke in detail with reporters about plans to develop civil aviation in the future, stating that domestic air routes are already of a considerable scale. The primary goals going forward are, first, to improve facilities to the extent economically feasible, and second, to open new air routes to adapt to the political situation. For example, air routes to border provinces such as Xinjiang are purely loss-making from a commercial standpoint, but they have significant value from a national political perspective and therefore must be undertaken. In terms of international routes, because the 20th century is the century of aviation, countries in Europe and America, even small ones like the Netherlands and Belgium, all have international air routes. China cannot lag behind, so even if it means losing money, the country must be supported. For example, the soon-to-be-launched Sino-US air route is estimated to cost approximately US$25,000 per one-way flight, while passenger and cargo revenue is only US$20,000. In other words, each flight will incur a loss of US$5,000. However, despite this, it is still necessary to proceed. This air route is expected to officially open in mid-June. In addition, new air routes such as Sino-French and Sino-British routes are currently being negotiated by government authorities. Liu continued, stating another ideal: he believes that Beijing is one of the most beautiful cities in the world. If safety and comfort can be maximized in terms of travel and accommodation, it will surely attract international tourists to visit. This would also bring in a large amount of foreign exchange for the country. Therefore, China National Aviation Corporation will strive to develop and improve the Beijing air route in the future.

### "Foreign Tiger" Appeal to be Heard Today, Prosecutor Submits Supplementary Brief

[Our Newspaper] "Foreign Tiger" Meisber, after being sentenced to one year in prison by the District Court, appealed to the High Court. At the same time, the prosecutor in charge, Quan Tao, believes that the sentence was too lenient and also filed an appeal. The High Court has scheduled a hearing for the case this morning. Prosecutor Quan submitted a supplementary appeal brief yesterday, stating briefly: In mid-February of this year, the price of gold and US dollars rose sharply, with gold rising from 400,000 yuan to over 900,000 yuan, and prices followed suit. The National Government then took extraordinary measures and formulated an emergency economic plan. Meisber blatantly disregarded the laws that our country widely promulgates and obeys. The original judgment stated that he was a foreign businessman who was unfamiliar with our country's laws and only sentenced him to one year, which is difficult to consider fair. Moreover, the defendant is a large foreign buyer with the real ability to manipulate black market prices for foreign currency, as evidenced by transaction records. The original sentence was too lenient and did not achieve the purpose of improvement, but would only encourage contempt for our country's laws.

### Beef Stall Assistant Dies from Assault

[Our Newspaper] Li Fusheng and his wife, Li Wangshi, from Songjiang, who live at No. 131, Lane 575, Tangshan Road, run a coffee stall at Pier 12 on the Bund. Yesterday evening at 6:30 PM, Cai Youfu, from Yangzhou, who runs a beef stall next to Pier 11, was setting up his stall when his assistant, Bu Xiaotu (from Danyang, 26 years old), accidentally knocked over one of Li's seat benches. Mr. and Mrs. Li immediately stepped forward and tried to overturn the beef stall in retaliation, but Bu stopped them, and an argument ensued. Mrs. Li even reached out and slapped Bu's cheeks twice. Unexpectedly, Li Fusheng could not contain his anger, took off his coat, and punched and kicked Bu repeatedly, inflicting serious injuries that soon led to his death.

### Cook Kills Wife, Bloodshed Occurs in Lao Tai'an Lane Early This Morning

[Our Newspaper] A bloody incident occurred at No. 53, Lao Tai'an Lane, Fujian North Road, at around 7 AM yesterday morning. Upon receiving the report, the North Railway Station Police Branch, led by Section Chief Shi and police officers Qiu Guishan and Li Xianwen, went to investigate and arrested the perpetrator, Qi Guanrong (31 years old, from Haining), along with the murder weapon, a kitchen knife, and took him to the police station for questioning.

According to his confession, he works as a cook at the Hongxing Meal Shop at No. 369, Xiangfen Lane. The victim was his wife, Wu, 30 years old, and they had been married for 11 years. They had two sons and one daughter, all of whom died young. After bringing Wu to Shanghai last year, it was difficult to find housing due to the housing shortage. He boarded and lodged at the meal shop, while Wu worked as a female worker at the Jiang Kangji Light Bulb Factory at No. 709, Yuyao Road, and stayed in the factory's workshop at night. During holidays, they often met in a separate room in a hotel. The day before yesterday, on Labor Day, the factory was closed, and he went to the factory to look for Wu but did not find her. He went to No. 53, Lao Tai'an Lane, to the home of his friend Yu Chenweifang, and saw Wu there. He invited her out, but she refused. He also asked her for money, but she refused, and an argument broke out. Before leaving, Wu told him that they should go their separate ways from now on. He therefore suspected her of infidelity and harbored resentment. So, at around 7 AM yesterday morning, he brought a kitchen knife to Yu's residence and saw her and Yu Chenweifang sleeping head-to-head on the third floor mezzanine. After an argument, he took out the kitchen knife and slashed Wu's head, back, arms, and mouth, inflicting seven or eight cuts. At the same time, Yu Chenweifang was also cut on the left middle finger and ring finger. The victim shouted in pain, alarming the whole house. The second landlord, Shen Gao, and neighbors arrived and surrounded him, and the police were called to arrest him. Wu's injuries were very serious, and the police sent both women to the Sino-American Hospital for treatment.

### Classrooms of Wuben Girls' Middle School Disrupted by Students from Municipal Teachers' College, Director Gu Sternly Admonishes

The City Education Bureau had allocated the school building of the Municipal Wuben Girls' Middle School at No. 200, Yongkang Road, to be shared with the Art Teachers' College. The Western-style buildings on the fourth floor were divided into two parts, left and right, and the sports field was shared. After the art decoration was removed, it was changed to be under the Municipal Teachers' College. Students of the Municipal Teachers' College were usually dissatisfied with the shared use of the school building, which caused friction. At about 5 PM on the 1st of this month, male students from the Municipal Teachers' College crossed from the roof platform into the school building of Wuben Girls' Middle School, disrupted the classrooms on the third and fourth floors of Wuben Girls' Middle School, blackened the blackboard with paint, broke into the teachers' dormitory, threw out the bedding, and posted slogans on the stairs and corridors, with abusive language.

### Mayor Summoned Members of the Cotton Yarn Control Committee Yesterday to Discuss Cotton Yarn Pricing Issues

A Subcommittee Meeting Will be Held Today to Discuss Prices Based on Costs

[Report from Our Newspaper] Mayor Wu invited all members of the Cotton Yarn Control Committee to a banquet at his official residence on Anfu Road yesterday at noon. During the banquet, opinions were exchanged on cotton yarn pricing and re-export issues. The main points are summarized as follows:

(1) Regarding pricing, the committee members felt that the current government-negotiated price of 4.6 million yuan per piece for 20-count standard yarn was insufficient to cover costs. Mayor Wu stated that the government believed that the failure to negotiate a price for cotton yarn in Shanghai in April was due to indecision and was not an appropriate strategy, so it had decided to negotiate a price in advance. After discussion, it was decided that a pricing subcommittee meeting would be held at the Textile Construction Company at 10:00 AM today to re-discuss prices based on actual production costs, so that the Cotton Yarn Control Committee could review and approve them before submitting them to the central authorities for decision.

Re-export Issues Still Need Review

(2) After discussion, the re-export of cotton yarn was decided in principle to be slightly more strictly restricted for cotton yarn shipped to the Northeast and North China, and a quota system would be adopted. In Central China, since the price difference was not significant, a more lenient policy could be temporarily adopted. This principle will be drafted into measures by the Cotton Yarn Control Committee and submitted to the central authorities for decision after review and approval at a meeting.

Cotton Yarn Pricing Should Be Reasonable

[Report from Our Newspaper] According to a textile industry authority who spoke to a reporter, the government's decision to set the protective price for 20-count standard yarn at 4.6 million yuan per piece would be sufficient to cover costs if calculated based on the cost of UNRRA cotton or quota-imported cotton. However, it would be insufficient if calculated based on the current cost of domestic cotton. He stated that the government's pricing decisions generally focus on the original cost, while most manufacturers focus on the cost of re-production. In his opinion, if pricing decisions are made purely based on the original cost, given the current rapid rise in prices, factories may be unable to maintain re-production. However, if pricing decisions are made purely based on the cost of re-production, the government believes that it would be tantamount to acknowledging the legality of black market prices, which is also inappropriate. Therefore, reasonable pricing should seek an average production cost from both the original cost and the cost of re-production, which would be a reasonable price that takes into account the facts. According to this calculation, the appropriate negotiated price for 20-count standard yarn should be between 5 million and 5.5 million yuan.

Suggestions for Construction and Improvement of the Dyeing and Weaving Industry

After the strengthening of cotton yarn and cloth control, the re-export of yarn and cloth from Shanghai to various ports in the north has been temporarily suspended for all but the Textile Construction Company, pending the Cotton Yarn Control Committee's regulations for issuing permits. The Shanghai Machinery Dyeing and Weaving Industry Association yesterday specially presented its opinions to the Cotton Yarn Control Committee for adoption: (1) The current cotton yarn and cloth pricing has failed to take into account the re-production of yarn factories, and the excess of Shanghai yarn prices is excusable if there is no excessive difference. In order to maintain production, the industry has no choice but to purchase cotton yarn at any time, and it is hoped that past practices will be overlooked and no further discussions will be held. (2) The following improvements are suggested for the methods for approving and permitting the re-export of yarn and cloth: A. Cancel the registration procedures for distributors and manufacturers. All members of industry associations related to yarn and cloth industries or commerce have the qualification to apply for distribution. B. The amount of yarn and cloth to be re-exported should be determined based on the amount of cotton yarn used by Shanghai weaving factories, and it is suggested that a limit of 80% of each factory's output be set. Within this limit, permission for re-export can be applied for at any time without restrictions. C. The procedure for applying for permits should be simplified by the industry association. D. The control target should be limited to cotton yarn and grey fabric. E. The control base number should be appropriately increased to alleviate the difficulties of merchants. Cotton yarn should start at one large package, and cotton cloth should be exempted from permits for less than 40 bolts. The above-mentioned presentation was submitted to the Cotton Yarn Control Committee by Pan Shihao, who was dispatched by the association. The Cotton Yarn Control Committee is currently studying it. If the presented sections are indeed reasonable, they will be submitted to the Cotton Yarn Control Committee for discussion.

Cotton Yarn and Cotton Cloth Continue to Rise

Due to the Textile Construction Company's change in the distribution method, the cotton yarn market is once again showing firmness. Spot prices for 20-count yarn are rising sharply, especially for bleached cloth, which is in high demand from dyeing and weaving factories. 20-count Double Happiness yarn is priced at 4.6 million yuan, and Fengnian cone yarn is priced at 4.7 million yuan, with an increase of 200,000 to 400,000 yuan. 16-count yarn is not in high demand from towel factories, and the price increase is minimal. The Textile Construction Company is selling unbranded yarn as usual. 42-count Baoguang grass package is priced at 99.8 million yuan, and 32-count Xiantao cone yarn is priced at 69.6 million yuan. The prices of all brands of coarse and fine yarn have increased by 300,000 to 500,000 yuan throughout the day.

Yesterday's cotton cloth market: The market opened steadily, with 20-count extra-fine cloth priced at 243,000 yuan and available for sale. Then, due to the Textile Construction Company's yarn sales and the news that the company will restrict distribution to industry members to only once a week, the market suddenly became bullish, and new buyers were active in the market, causing prices to rise sharply. In particular, Yuanji cloth rose even more sharply, with Four Gentlemen Golden Seal cloth rising from 268,000 yuan to 285,000 yuan, and 20-count extra-fine cloth rising from 247,000 yuan to 255,000 yuan. 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth rose sharply by 22,000 yuan to 300,500 yuan. Yiding Ruyi bleached cloth was in high demand, with each bolt rising by 30,000 yuan to 330,000 yuan. The market prices of other colored cloth, Yuanbu cloth, blue cloth, and Shilin cloth also rose.

Textile Construction Company Sells Yarn

[Report from Our Newspaper] The China Textile Construction Company began distributing cotton yarn according to the newly revised method yesterday, selling a total of 1211 pieces of yarn of various counts. According to regulations, yesterday was purely for manufacturers to apply for purchases, and a total of 421 applications were received. After this change in the yarn distribution method, the highest amount that each Class A manufacturer could be allocated was 48 pieces, and the highest amount that each Class B manufacturer could be allocated was 27 pieces.

### Lower Prices Reported in Production Areas, Rice Price Hikes Subside Slightly, Soybean Oil and Grains See Price Declines

[Report from Our Newspaper] The rise in rice prices has subsided slightly due to lower prices in the production areas and Mayor Wu's order to raise the retail price limit for Shanghai white rice to 200,000 yuan per stone. The market supply is still scarce, with only 1195.5 stones arriving. Black market prices for white rice are 230,000 to 240,000 yuan. High-quality white Yuan rice is priced at 265,000 yuan, and medium-quality rice is priced at 244,000 yuan. The Social Affairs Bureau released a total of 9,000 bags of white rice at the north and south markets, priced at 147,000 yuan.

Rice Shops Sell Rationed Rice Based on Household Certificates

Since the authorities stipulated that citizens must use their household registration certificates to purchase rationed rice from rice shops, rice shops that have already received rationed rice have begun to implement this method starting yesterday. The Social Affairs Bureau has also notified all rice shops that all retail rice must be registered and reported for verification starting yesterday. The authorities have also dispatched 40 people to registered rice shops to check accounts. If any irregularities are found, their distribution qualifications will be revoked.

Shengji soybean cake was 53,500 yuan, down 6,000 yuan.

There Is Talk of Restoring Free Trading of Edible Oil

[Report from Our Newspaper] Yesterday's edible oil market trended downwards because it was rumored that the authorities had temporarily allowed each factory to trade freely at market prices, with each stall of edible oil falling by a small amount of 20,000 to 30,000 yuan. However, due to tight credit conditions yesterday, although each factory had sales, the number of transactions was not large, totaling about 1,000 piculs. It is rumored that the authorities have approved each factory to tentatively restore free trading at market prices to see how the results are, and then decide on edible oil countermeasures. People in the industry said that if calculated based on the price of 520,000 yuan per picul of local soybean oil yesterday, the retail price of each jin at each retailer should be a maximum of 5,600 yuan.

### Our Country's Raw Silk Exports Have Decreased

Almost Vanished from the New York City Market

[Central News Agency, Washington, 1st Dispatch] The US Department of Commerce stated that China exported 11,500 bales of raw silk in the first eleven months of last year, while its raw silk exports in 1939 were 75,150 bales. The reason for the decrease in export volume is that the price of Chinese raw silk has increased, and the low exchange rate has reduced the purchasing power of the US dollar, making raw silk purchases in the New York market virtually prohibited. The department's report stated that, on the contrary, Yokohama and Kobe, Japan, exported 11,175 bales of raw silk in February of this year, and the allocation agency has allocated 68,707 bales of raw silk for export.

### The Shanghai Stock Market Soars; Market Outlook Faces Sudden Reversal

### Sugar Merchants Go to Taiwan to Purchase Sugar

Since the Taiwan Sugar Corporation stopped supplying sugar merchants, the spot supply of Taiwan sugar in the market has become increasingly scarce, leading to a surge in black market prices. To meet the urgent needs of its members, the industry association has raised funds and sent representatives to Taiwan to purchase sugar directly. It is reported that over 10,000 bags have been ordered and will soon be shipped to Shanghai. According to the market price in Taiwan Province, each Sima dan (approximately 50 kg) of medium-grade sugar is worth about 80 Taiwan dollars. Adding transportation and taxes, the legal currency cost is only about 340,000 yuan, which is more than 100,000 yuan less than the black market price. Therefore, it is expected that the sugar market will stabilize after the sugar arrives in Shanghai.

### National Bank Establishes Joint Committee to Centralize News Releases

[Reported by This Newspaper] To centralize the release of news from the bank, the Central Bank has established a News Liaison Committee, consisting of Li Lixia, Director of the Auditing Department; Ji Chaoding, Director of the Economic Research Department; and Fan Heyan, Deputy Director of the Secretariat. A dedicated office has been designated, and the three committee members will take turns hosting reporters from various newspapers from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM and 4:00 PM to 6:00 PM each day.

### Glutinous Rice Branches High

Glutinous rice branches are scarce in both arrivals and inventory, resulting in a perceived shortage. Although prices are high, demand remains. Yesterday, market prices rose again by 20% to 30%.

### Industrial Association Petitions Central Government to Improve Quota Allocation

The China Industrial Association petitioned the central authorities and the Import Control Committee yesterday regarding the import of industrial raw materials. The original text is as follows: The allocated quota values for imported goods have not adequately addressed the current need to rescue the critically endangered industries. The Association and its members have previously resolved to petition the government with five requests, which were submitted in document No. 404 on April 26th, requesting adoption and dispatching representatives for a petition. The requests were approved and considered. However, three days later, the quota values for the second phase were announced, leading industrial colleagues to believe that the government was discriminating against the opinions of the industrial sector. Although explanations were given that the quotas had been approved by the Supreme Economic Council and were due to international credit relationships, preventing their cancellation, the government should still reconsider the matter in order to support the national industry. To remedy the existing situation and safeguard the survival of the fragile industries, we propose to request the government again: (1) Regarding the foreign exchange allocated to importers for the first phase of announced import quotas, the Quota Allocation Office should order importers to notify the relevant industrial trade associations of the allocated amounts and types of goods, so that the associations can make reasonable and fair allocations. (2) The right to allocate import quotas for the second phase should be granted to the industrial sector. (3) The quota values for imported goods in the third phase should adopt the opinions of the industrial sector. (4) Essential raw materials and materials that cannot be produced domestically should be classified as Category 1 and exempt from quota restrictions. (5) The government should promptly lift the restrictions on raw materials and materials produced in the Northeast and Taiwan, allowing the industrial sector to freely purchase them. (6) If the government insists that import foreign exchange can only be applied for in the name of importers, then the industrial trade associations should be granted the qualifications of importers to apply. The above six points are the urgent needs of the industrial sector. The Association and its members, on behalf of the entire industrial sector, appeal to the government to review and adopt them, and respectfully await a reply.

### Rice Riots Again in Hangzhou

— Special Correspondent Chu Yusheng

Hangzhou Express, April 34th

During February of this year, when the surging tide of gold prices in the country swept through Hangzhou, rice prices also soared, leading to rumors of attacks on rice shops. The municipal authorities urgently convened relevant parties to discuss the issue. Rice merchants insisted that prices were high at the source, making it impossible to lower them. They proposed releasing 1,000 dan of rice from the four banks each day for distribution to rice shops at fixed prices. The municipal government, lacking a better solution, accepted the rice merchants' proposal and authorized the release of 1,000 dan of rice from the four banks to rice shops daily at a fixed price of 73,000 yuan per dan, with a limit of five sheng per household and purchases restricted to stores. However, the rice supplied by the four banks to the rice shops consisted of old rice, broken rice, and inferior rice. Consequently, some middle-class families were willing to pay 100,000 yuan to rice merchants for white rice.

Hongdao Incident: Hoarding Rice

Not long after, the Hongdao Girls' Middle School rice hoarding case involving 1,000 dan of rice was exposed. The incident was discovered late at night by a responsible individual from a certain order maintenance organization. After being reported in the newspapers, Hongdao Girls' Middle School initially denied the allegations, claiming that the rice was intended for the students' consumption and was contracted out to a shop. An investigation by the Municipal Police Bureau also concluded that the allegations were untrue. However, the public remained skeptical. As a result, the municipal government initiated an investigation team that included representatives from the Municipal Council and other organizations. After about a week, it was determined that Hongdao Girls' Middle School had hoarded only a small amount of rice. Various organizations issued reports, which the public trusted. Subsequently, the police arrested several individuals for hoarding rice and smuggling grain. However, the Grain Association proved that the grain was purchased from the production area and transported for sale in the city.

Rice Prices: Frenzied Jumps

In the past month, rice prices have jumped dramatically, from 100,000 yuan per dan to 120,000 yuan, then to 150,000 yuan, and finally to 180,000 yuan or even 200,000 yuan. The official price of rice in Hangzhou is still 127,000 yuan, a significant difference. Four days ago, the head of the Hangzhou Municipal Government's Land and Food Department stated, "The city has 11,370 dan of rice stored in the four banks, 8,039 dan registered in the grain merchants' inventory, and 110,000 dan in the Central Bank, totaling 130,000 dan, which is sufficient for three months." The director of the Provincial Land and Food Department also reported at the Provincial Assembly, "Hangzhou has requested the Ministry of Food to allocate additional grain reserves, ensuring no food shortage for the people." Unexpectedly, four days later, rice prices jumped so drastically. The municipal government has indeed shown its strong determination by ordering the arrest of illegal grain merchants selling on the black market. Mayor Zhou has also stated that the business licenses of grain merchants selling on the black market will be revoked if necessary. Some rice shops selling on the black market have indeed been arrested, but the black market price of rice remains high. Even in the rice shops, only rationed coarse rice is available, with baskets filled with chaff and empty husks. If someone wants to buy rice, they must approach rice merchants for high-priced black market rice.

Reason: High Prices at the Source

Newspapers in Hangzhou have suggested that this is a power struggle between grain merchants and the municipal government. In reality, according to the chairman of the Grain Association, "The government's price limit is too low, and costs are not covered, making it impossible to operate. The stores' rice inventory can only last for a week at most." He also stated, "Merchants will not come if they are beaten, scolded, or lose money." The crucial question now is whether the existing grain reserves are sufficient to meet current needs. According to the officials of the provincial and municipal Land and Food Departments, there is no problem. However, the chairman of the Grain Association only stated that "the price limit is too low, and costs are not covered, making it impossible to operate," and therefore "the stores' rice inventory can only last for a week at most." If the price limit is raised and costs are covered, then it might be possible to sustain operations. From this perspective, the Grain Association intends to raise grain prices, citing high prices at the source. According to the reporter's investigation in production areas such as Xia You, farmers had already sold large quantities of grain to the rice market last fall and winter, leaving very little remaining. Therefore, farmers are not responsible for the increase in grain prices. At the same time, the numbers of rice stocks made public by the director of the Hangzhou government Land and Food Department are not those stored recently. According to insiders, the high price at the production area is in sync with those in the market. The reasons for the current high grain price is thus apparent.

Municipal Government: Decided on a Plan

With such high grain prices, all vegetables and oils have doubled in price, and pork has reached 5,600 yuan per catty. The general public is terrified by these high prices. However, grain merchants continue to argue that costs are too high, urging the government to raise grain prices. Now, it remains to be seen if the government has a solution. It is reported that the municipal government has decided on a plan, which involves establishing grain public sales stores and setting up foreign procurement agencies. This approach would make grain a public enterprise, completely freezing the operations of grain merchants. Another proposal is to continue allocating 1,000 dan of rice from the four banks each day to rice shops for sale at fixed prices. If the latter approach is implemented, the situation will be the same as when the gold rush swept through Hangzhou, with black market sales continuing. If the former approach is implemented, then grain merchants will have no opportunity to profit, and they will naturally soften. However, this all depends on the government's determination.

Grain: Public Sales, etc.

However, establishing grain public sales stores and foreign procurement agencies cannot be achieved overnight. It requires a period of preparation, recruiting business operators, finding store locations, and determining the amount of initial capital. Furthermore, if some unscrupulous rice merchants conspire with the government and use numerous accounts to purchase grain, like they did with gold, the government's controlled rice will eventually run out. At that point, unscrupulous grain merchants can raise their heads again, and their status will be different.

I believe that the current plan should not only focus on investigating the black market for rice, but also on strictly investigating hoarding. If hoarding is discovered, the entire quantity of rice should be confiscated or purchased at the official price, and even a few unscrupulous grain merchants should be severely punished. This is a more thorough approach. Otherwise, the investigation of the black market will never be exhaustive, and those who sell on the black market will have their own channels, with larger companies having more methods and greater power.

We believe that the time when the rice harvest is unavailable has not arrived, and Hangzhou's rice inventory is abundant, so there should be no rice shortage. The reasons for this rice shortage have already been analyzed very clearly, so it only remains to be seen if the government has the determination.

### Letter from the Families of the Victims of the Fubo Ship Case

Dear Editor:

Here is an example:

During the initial court hearing for the Fubo-Hai Min ship case today, Wei Wenda, the lawyer hired by Dai Rulin, appeared in court. When Jiao Zongxiao, the engineering officer who survived the Fubo ship disaster, recounted the ordeal, he mentioned that there were approximately sixty or seventy people floating in the water awaiting rescue, and their cries for help were harrowing. At this point, the lawyer suddenly asked Jiao, "How do you know there were sixty or seventy people?" The intention was to overturn the testimony of the only surviving witness from the Fubo, so that Dai Rulin would not have to fight the lawsuit and would naturally win.

Lawyer Wei accused Zheng Guiren, a passenger on the Hai Min, of making baseless statements, which was purely arbitrary.

When Wu Kan, the second officer of the Hai Min, described the collision, Lawyer Wei even said that Wu's account was incorrect and offered many reasons on Wu's behalf. Could Lawyer Wei, who was on land, be more knowledgeable and specific than Wu, who personally experienced the incident? The judge was very perceptive and simply said, "I am questioning him, not you." Consequently, Lawyer Wei sat down in silence.

The initial hearing was only an investigation, so there should have been no need for debate. However, Attorney Wei, in an effort to demonstrate his extraordinary efforts on behalf of the defendant, completely refuted our reasons as families of the victims. We are sharing the experience of attending the hearing with the public and asking for public judgment. (Wang Hangmanjun, Zhu Cai Xiuzhang, Chen Chengli Xia, families of the victims of the Fubo ship) April 29th

### The Zionist Movement

— Guan Zhou

Recently, we often see reports in the newspapers about the conflicts in Palestine, which are related to the Zionist movement.

Palestine is located on the southern part of the eastern coast of the Mediterranean Sea, bordering Syria to the north, the Sinai Peninsula of Egypt to the south, and Jordan to the east. It covers an area of approximately 10,430 square miles and has a population of 1,450,000. It is the holy land of the three major religions of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.

Before the Common Era, Jews established a state there. In 70 AD, after the Roman general Titus conquered Jerusalem, the Jews were expelled from the country. In the late 19th century, Dr. Herzl advocated for the Zionist movement, but it was unsuccessful.

The root cause of the current conflict can be traced back to World War I. During that war, Britain, in order to utilize the Arabs, promised them the freedom to establish a state in Palestine after the war. At the same time, it wanted to win over Jews around the world, hoping they would also help the Allied countries. In the famous Balfour Declaration, the British government stated, "His Majesty's Government views with favour the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people, and will use their best endeavours to facilitate the achievement of this object." This dual promise naturally led to conflict.

After World War II, President Truman, recognizing the Nazi persecution and mistreatment of Jews, their displacement and wandering, and the fact that there were 500,000 to 600,000 displaced Jews after the war, helped them return to Palestine to rebuild their country and provided various forms of assistance. As Palestine was originally the homeland of the Jewish ancestors, the Hebrews, and the Bible contains detailed records, even though Jews are currently fewer in number than Arabs, the Jews are qualitatively superior to the Arabs. They used their substantial funds and scientific methods to establish many large enterprises, achieving great accomplishments in education and engineering. There are two important cities, Tel Aviv and Haifa, which have become purely Jewish cities. Fertile land has been bought up by Jews, and prosperous cities are filled with Jews, naturally incurring the resentment of Arabs. The British are also uneasy and use force to suppress them. However, in the United States, not only President Truman, but also public opinion supports the Zionist movement. A public opinion poll was conducted last year, and 78% of those surveyed believed that the country should be rebuilt, 14% opposed it, and the rest had no opinion. Therefore, last August, an editorial in the Mainland News advised the British not to use force, as coercive measures would only make the Jews, who would rather die than submit, more united and determined to fight.

Twenty-seven years ago, the Father of the Nation also supported the Zionist movement. In a letter he wrote to the Shanghai Jewish monthly magazine "Israel's Messenger," he said, "I express my deep sympathy for this Zionist movement, which is one of the most important movements of modern times. All democrats should do their best to help you restore the ancient country in history."

"In blood and fire, the Jewish state will be reborn!" This is the song sung by the Jewish secret army, the Haganah. The Haganah currently has around 70,000 members operating in the Middle East. They will likely be able to rebuild their homeland in the Holy Land.

Spring and Autumn Annals

### An Interview with Female Painter Gu Qingyao

— Nie Guangdi

The arts scene is flourishing today, but it is rare to find someone like Ms. Gu Qingyao from Fujian who is exceptional in poetry, calligraphy, and painting. I had long admired her reputation as a painter in Suzhou, and yesterday, through a friend's introduction, I visited her residence. Ms. Gu was casually receiving guests. The room contained desks and tables covered with stationery and silk, and three ancient zithers hung on the walls, suggesting her fondness for music. She showed me several recent works, all characterized by clarity, antiquity, and elegance, combining meticulousness and freedom. Her style was both lofty and refined, with a grand and detailed composition. The brushwork was vigorous, and the ink was rich and layered, demonstrating her mastery of the styles of Da Dizi and Xin Luo, along with her understanding of the Song and Yuan dynasties. Her work was far beyond what ordinary artists could achieve. She inscribed on her landscape painting: "I still indulge in my poetic madness behind closed doors, my ink gradually aging and deepening as I grow old. I refuse to compromise with the current trends, but pay homage to Qing Xiang with my lofty integrity." She also inscribed on her imitation of Shitao's landscape painting: "Wanting to pick up the scorched paulownia zither, the peaks are cold on all sides. Fragrant herbs hide in the rock creepers, and ancient trees grow gnarled knots. Mountain spirits are driving ten thousand carts, and pine pollen falls on the cloud tops. As the sun sets, the Chu traveler's heart is stirred, but who will awaken the summoned soul?"

Ms. Gu told me that these paintings were also intended for the exhibition of the Women's Calligraphy and Painting Association. I asked to see her poetry and calligraphy manuscripts, and found a recent inscription she wrote for Lu Minggang's "Flower-Filled Good Fortune Studio Pledge Picture Golden Tower Melody": "The flames of war spread, yet there is still a sense of liberation. Like Fang Weng, I harbor righteous indignation, maintain purity, and worry about the country. My only habits are books and paintings, cherishing the rice-measuring cup and yellow flowers. Who would have expected that smoke and clouds would bring disaster, no less than the grief of Donghua Temple? I sigh, caressing the ashes for ten years. Alas, what a fierce fire! Reassembling the coral iron net, the clanging of bells and the cold gold inscription enhance the beauty. The paper and silk preserve the pure and unblemished aspirations, accustomed to loving the plum blossoms that stretch across the stones. The way remains the same, and the room is filled with the fragrance of ink. From now on, I will have thousands of axes of books in the library, treasuring the flowers like jade, and indulging in this obsession." I have observed the works of her disciples, and their brushwork in trees and rocks all conforms to the principles of painting, which is truly remarkable. Having met Ms. Gu, I now understand the source of her teaching abilities.

My friend told me that Ms. Gu's character is even more admirable than her painting skills. I replied: "Of course, I have already learned this from reading her poetry and calligraphy. In these degenerate times, I did not expect to find someone with such upright character as Ms. Gu. People are known by their art, and art is elevated by character. Only Ms. Gu can be said to truly deserve this praise."

### Rainy Day

— Lan Hui

After a few days of sunshine, just when people were feeling warm and cozy, a bit lazy; this morning, it suddenly started drizzling again. Walking in the rain, I can't suppress a feeling of intimacy.

When I lived in the countryside, I had a special interest: I loved walking barefoot with an umbrella on rainy mornings. Looking down, I would stroll on the stone-paved path, washed extremely clean by the rain, or slide along the muddy edges of the fields; on one hand, I would watch my feet being soaked and turned very white, or being covered in yellow mud, and on the other hand, I would quietly listen to the sound of raindrops hitting the umbrella. Then, I would feel an indescribable ease and joy. At this moment, my mind would be as clean as if it had been washed, and all the annoying thoughts of weekdays would suddenly disappear; and often, the literary inspirations and poetic lines that I had long sought would flow out like a clear stream.

I wrote down those natural and pure poetic verses, and I also took the rain scene in the fields of the morning as part of my best memories.

The spring rain calls out to the green vitality within the soil. Who has visited the spring fields the morning after a spring rain? Seeing those green seedlings emerging from the soil, filled with gratitude, gently trembling and carrying water droplets, how can you reject that joy of growth?

The summer rain expresses the intensity of vitality: it comes abruptly and violently, and leaves decisively. That magnificent beauty makes you feel both fear and joy at the same time: it reminds people of the clear sky after the rain, and the rainbow in the sky.

And melancholy and longing accompany the autumn rain. Boundless, faint, as if the endless autumn rain, tempts boundless reveries, giving endless flavors to affectionate people of longing.

Naturally, the winter rain makes people sad. However, aren't the hibernating insects accumulating energy for spring? Doesn't the sorrowful winter rain also cry for the approaching end of winter's life? ...

This year, spring is late - no, it is winter reluctant to leave late; still crying winter rain in the days that should be spring. But, why should we despair, or even doubt whether spring will come? Look, hasn't the withered grass in the corner already secretly changed color? ....

### Pine Needles

— Bao Yu

In "Baopuzi," there is such a record:

"During the reign of Emperor Cheng of the Han Dynasty, a hunter in the Zhongnan Mountains saw a person without clothes and covered in black hair. The hunter wanted to catch him, but the person leapt over pits and valleys, flying as if soaring, impossible to reach far. Therefore, he secretly watched where he was, encircled and caught him. It was a woman. When asked, she said, 'I was originally a palace woman of Qin. Hearing that the bandits from Guandong were coming, the King of Qin surrendered, the palaces were burned, I fled in shock to the mountains, hungry and with nothing to eat, I was about to starve to death. An old man taught me to eat pine needles and pine nuts. At first, it was bitter and astringent, but later I became accustomed to it, and so I did not feel hunger or thirst, not cold in winter, and not hot in summer.' Calculating that this woman was a palace woman of Ziying, the Prince of Qin, it was more than three hundred years until the time of Emperor Cheng. So they brought her back and fed her grain. At first, she vomited at the smell of grain, but after several days she calmed down. After about two years, the hair on her body fell off, she became old and died. If she had not been found, she would have become an immortal."

Reading this "myth" made me think of a fact that I had experienced.

In the spring of 1943, after the enemy's large-scale sweep in northern Jiangsu, I temporarily took refuge on the edge of a water marsh. I was robbed several times by stray soldiers, and I lost all my clothes, leaving only a single pair of pants. I crossed the enemy area and crossed the river to southern Anhui; but in just a few days, the enemy cavalry arrived again. Because I was unfamiliar with the place, there was nowhere for me to hide, so I went to the mountains to find a hiding place.

When describing the terrain of southern Anhui, there is originally a statement that "there is no three feet of flat land." Once you enter the mountains, there is a possibility that the mountain stones will hurt your nose. All you see are continuous mountains and high hills, as if the mountain gods deliberately deployed a "mountain formation," making it impossible for the people who have thrown themselves in to escape forever.

At that time, I found a valley and used the surrounding rocks as my protective shell; but there was still a line of sky exposed above, so I took off a jacket and tied the four corners to the branches, thinking that this could block out this terrifying world.

But in fact, terror still followed the gunshots and shells.

The sharp sound of bullets and the heavy sound of shells flew over my head, and although my body couldn't help but tremble, I could barely control my legs, preventing them from leaving this valley and running elsewhere.

"If I am destined to die, then this valley is a natural coffin."

I thought like this, thinking, very painfully, second by second.

From noon until night, the sound of gunfire gradually subsided, but another serious threat began to be added to me. - That is hunger.

The night wind brought the frightened cries of distant birds. I knew that in the mountains, there must be many suffering people hiding, and they were suffering the same way. Where could I find food? There was no way. I could only look for readily available "food" on the pine trees around me. Handfuls of pine needles were continuously sent into my mouth. At first, I felt a little bitter, but later I felt it was fragrant and sweet.

The war continued for five days. I ate pine needles for five days. Almost all the pine needles around me had been picked. By the sixth day, nature had returned to its original peace, and the enemy had retreated. I climbed out of the valley, feeling dizzy and unable to distinguish directions. Looking into the distance, I saw someone leaning against a rock, so I quickly walked forward, preparing to ask for directions. Who knew that when I looked closer, it turned out to be a corpse. His face was pale, and there was a pool of blood on the ground. He was probably killed by stray bullets. After walking a few more steps, I saw another person lying next to a tree. Upon closer inspection, it turned out to be a corpse as well, but there were no wounds on this corpse, and no blood was seen on the ground. I guessed that this was probably caused by the double attack of fright and hunger. I looked at this corpse, feeling both sorrow and deep self-congratulation, congratulating myself that I was able to survive these five days entirely by relying on pine needles; otherwise, I would have been companions with the corpse in front of me.

Baopuzi said that eating pine nuts can "become an immortal," so even though I ate pine needles for five days and did not become an immortal, I have already explored the path to "immortality."

### Zhou Yushan's Solo Exhibition of Calligraphy

— Yang Zhongyi

Zhou Yushan, the owner of Qiugu Studio, held a solo calligraphy exhibition at the Great New Company. I accepted Mr. Zhou's invitation to visit, and there were more than a hundred pieces on display, a dazzling array, beautiful and captivating. Among various styles of calligraphy, seal script (篆體) was the most prevalent. Upon a comprehensive review of the variations in his seal script, the "iron wire seal script" (鐵綫篆) type best captured its essence. Iron wire seal script is not easy to create; one must have a meticulous mind to conform to the rules. Mr. Zhou's two large pieces, the "Former and Latter Expeditions" (前後出師表) by Zhuge Liang, had numerous characters, even strokes, as fine as autumn down, as dense as a spider web. Whether viewed closely or from afar, they appeared clear as woven brocade, a testament to his masterful brushwork and wrist strength. There were also many other seal script works such as oracular bone script and couplets from the Zhou Maogong Ding (周毛公鼎). In addition, there were eight old works from ten years ago: 1. Xia Yu's Goulou Stele (夏禹岣嶁碑), 2. Yin Ruins Oracle Bone Script (殷虛甲骨文), 3. Zhou Maogong Ding (周毛公鼎), 4. Kuaiji Mountain Stone Inscriptions (會稽山石刻文), 5. Han Kaiwu Temple Xingshi Shinto Stone Gate Inscriptions (漢開毋廟興始神道石闕文), 6. Wei Zhengshi Three-Script Stone Classics (魏正始三體石經), 7. Wu Tianfa Divine Discussion Three-Fragment Stele (吳天發神議三段殘碑), 8. Tang Li Yangbing City God Temple Text (唐李陽冰城隍廟文). These eight works, spanning from Xia to Tang, contained historical significance and were listed as excellent in the National Celebrities' Painting and Calligraphy Exhibition in the 25th year of the Republic of China. Yu stele is hidden in Hengshan, the seal script is special, and the characters are difficult to identify; although there are three interpretations since ancient times, there are many doubtful characters, and it is rarely copied because its style of writing is different from all other seal scripts. I say that Mr. Zhou's iron wire seal script is elegant and outstanding, like Ouyang Xun's characters, and Yu stele's majestic is like Yan Lugong's characters, both styles have their own wonderful points.

I also saw a piece of regular and running script intermingled, staggered and quite beautified, all collected Yan style characters, it can be said that Mr. Zhou can use the spirit of Yan characters to admire Yu stele's shape, of course, the shape and spirit are all in place. Although a few of his oracle bone script characters are a little thin, this may be due to the difference in the stele version? If recent works are compared to those from ten years ago, they are even more similar. Recently, there have been more and more calligraphy couplets collected from oracle bone script, most of the strokes are like knife cuts, because at that time the characters were carved on oracle bones, the beginning and end have sharp edges, not necessarily uniform at both ends, like iron wire seal script, iron wire seal script is like iron wire, oracle bone script is like bamboo silk, the brush is just between rigidity and softness, the style is different. Among the eight works, the two ends of the Three-Script Stone Classics are too sharp, and the middle seems a little wide, so it falls into weakness, like the Wanfang orchid leaf style. I often say that Xue Shanggong's bronze tripods are not as good as Ruan Yuan's bronze tripods, also because Xue's style is sharp at both ends, and Ruan's style is not sharp, just like the seal script engraved on the bronze ware that day. I would like to ask experts for their opinions on this.

### Shuangyu Xuan Lyrics

— Gang Weifa

Bodhisattva Crown

The cool moon in the sky is so round, don’t be careless in the cold of the award. The wild geese are crossing, someone misses you in the middle of the night. The autumn wind keeps blowing, and should pass the south bank of the Yangtze River. Don't hesitate, the returning boat has not yet returned.

Jianlan - Inscription on the Painting of Jiexi Ze Pan Walking and Chanting

The rivers and plains are boundless, and the white labor is never-ending; checking the parting feelings, how many times the west wind geese do not come. The heart is still there, the clouds at the end of the sky are long and hazy; walking and chanting on the edge of the swamp, the smoke willows and the setting sun have arrived today.

Deep and Far Stream Gauze - A Gift

Crouching like lice in trousers, the threads are intricate; how many times have new tears been seen in Xinting! Striking the oars to cross the river to embrace Zu Ti, hearing the sword dance to invite Liu Kun; looking forward to the ambition to despise the autumn clouds.

浣溪紗 - Lonely Goose

Leaving the flock, the clouds rest more, the frost and wind are still the autumn of the old year; who is my companion in the clear and cold? I am afraid that missing people will add more tears of parting, I should hide my shadow in the deserted continent; I dare not pass the high-rise building in tears.

### An Inch of Land, An Inch of Blood 501

— Ye Jingfeng

"Your department?" Tsurumi started to question leisurely.

"The Eleventh Brigade, Second Squad, Third Team, First-Class Service." As he spoke, he stood up and saluted, but Tsurumi pressed him down and told him to sit down:

"You went to the pier this morning to welcome Miss Nakamura, presumably arranged by your superior?"

"Yes, there was a notice from the embassy last night... The service is not very clear... It is said that it should be hosted by the military, because the comfort service in North China is directly handled by the military. But this morning, the reception of the two gentlemen was not directly notified by North China, but was telegraphed to the embassy by the Lord... This is Mr. Tian, the Ambassador..."

"Understood." Tsurumi disliked this person being too verbose. "Then, the arrangement of the Banzai Hall was also designated by the military?"

"The service is not very clear..." The service thought for a moment "...But according to the situation, I am afraid it was designated by the embassy."

"How do you know?"

"The military has never used the Banzai Hall to entertain officials of all parties, departments, and levels."

"Oh," Tsurumi did not want to get involved in side issues because of time constraints. "There is one thing I presume you can still remember - this morning when I heard Miss Nakamura get into the car, there was a ragged young man hiding next to the car, you probably saw him?"

"Oh……" The service thought for a moment, as if he did not remember this morning's events very clearly. "...Yes,...I remember: there was a beggar; there are many beggars of this kind in Shanghai. It's simply professionalized: in parking lots everywhere, or temporary parking places, there are these kinds of beggars who automatically watch over the cars for people, wanting to beg for some tips. At the same time, they are professional petty thieves. If you don't let them watch over the car, or don't give them tips, they will definitely steal something from the car, or damage the car somewhat..."

"Understood," Tsurumi interrupted this guy's report again. "Did you hear the beggar speak at that time?"

"...It seems I heard... I can't say for sure... Perhaps I thought he was begging for tips at the time, so I didn't pay much attention."

"Very good," these two words were Tsurumi's common saying, not necessarily used according to their usual meaning. "Did you pay attention to the beggar's time of arrival and departure and traces?... "

"This question...!" The service saw that Tsurumi's questions were gradually intensifying step by step, and only then did he realize that he was being interrogated and that he himself was in a position of suspicion, so while answering, he left his seat and stood straight to the side. "...Regarding this beggar, the service really did not pay attention at the time, because there are too many things of this kind in Shanghai. However, the mistake of the service's oversight is unavoidable...!" This service was very understanding and could also talk.

"Please sit down, " Tsurumi felt uneasy: his original intention was to elicit the truth from the service in a "chat" manner, but he was too hasty for a moment, making the steps and words of the questioning overflow the originally planned scope, resulting in somewhat of a stalemate, so he still gestured for the service to sit down and talk, intending to ease the atmosphere somewhat. "Please understand, I am not interrogating you for any suspicion,... The reason is that an unexpected, untoward state of affairs has occurred, and we suspect the beggar, so we invited you to talk about it. We have no questions about you..."

"The service understands very well," the service did not sit down. "The service seems to remember that before the two gentlemen got into the car, the service did not pay attention and did not see him. By the time I saw him, it was already before the car started, and I did not take him seriously... This is the truth!"

### Orphan Zhu Aibo

— Newsboy

Fu Fugen, a seventeen-year-old boy, had just committed suicide out of shame and regret for the difficulty of making a living and for burdening his sixty-year-old father with the burden of supporting the family. Zhu Aibo, this fifteen-year-old unfortunate girl, took the same path two days ago.

We know that the competition for survival is originally extremely serious, but it seems to only apply to adults who have entered society. However, today, among the endless urban tragedies, there are even children. This is truly tragic.

Of course, we don't know why children, who should be innocent and carefree, are so despairing about life, and after despair, rush to death so resolutely. This cannot be seen as a passive attitude. Our children are not afraid of death and are able to do something and are ambitious.

Imagine a seventeen-year-old boy being able to ask the foreign concessions bureau for a license to sell newspapers and magazines to earn commissions to maintain his livelihood. Imagine a fifteen-year-old girl wanting to continue her studies without relying on her family to steal money. This spirit of seeking survival is truly admirable.

After the blind girl Rudel, the heroine of Diderot, regained her sight, she committed suicide out of despair for seeing this ugly world. She had not yet truly touched the hardness of reality, but it is enough to make us close the book and sigh. Zhu Aibo, this young girl, truly came from real life. Her suicide is nothing less than the loudest accusation against current society.

No matter how bad the times develop, don't let such tragic results befall our children. If our society feels that there is no way out even for children, then there really is no way out.

Please listen, girls like Zhu Aibo will also say sadly: "Living in this society, it's so boring." This has more analytical and research value than a million conceptual papers.

May there be a ray of light in our society for children like Zhu Aibo to live on!

### Mozi and Confucius

— Zhang Sheng

If I had been born in a dynasty before the Qing Dynasty, I would certainly not have dared to criticize Confucius, nor would I often mention Mozi. Confucius's theories were not allowed to be criticized by people at that time, and Mozi's ideas were not advocated by scholars at that time. Therefore, Confucius's door was crowded with visitors, and his name shook the four seas; but Mozi's door was deserted, and his name was unknown ten miles away! Now, I will cite two examples as follows:

(1) Mozi Stops Chu from Attacking Song

During the Warring States period, Chu, claiming hegemony, wanted to attack Song after obtaining Longshu. Upon hearing this, Mozi went to Chu overnight, saw the King of Chu and asked him to dispel his original intention. However, his minister Gongshuban refused to accept it and fought with him for a long time. In the end, Gongshuban lost and agreed to stop attacking Song, so the people of Song were spared disaster.

(2) "Disrespectful to the Master"

During the Zhou Dynasty, one day, a certain military commander and his entourage visited Confucius. When they entered the door, both of them bowed, but the commander's entourage accidentally looked up. The next day, he was dismissed from his post, and the charge was "disrespectful to the Master."

Reading the above two short stories, you can know the thoughts of the two of them. Mozi is peaceful and worldly; Confucius is "follow the monarch."

Mozi advocated universal love and non-aggression, and promoted active reading - dynamic research and white-motion observation - the science he studied before, such as astronomy, teaching, etc., has now been realized, it can be seen that he was not blindly doing it at that time, but was researching based on ideas.

Confucius advocated the doctrine of loyalty and filial piety that "a monarch wants a subject to die, he must die; a father wants a son to perish, he must perish." He only advocated loyalty and filial piety of abandoning delusion. Now, we should first distinguish right from wrong and dedicate ourselves to the country and honor our parents. He believes that reading for fame and martial arts is to die in the battlefield for ancestors. If this is really the case, then the students studying and the soldiers fighting have lost their true meaning.

### How to Listen to Symphonies?

— Sheng He

"Symphony" is the crystallization of music art that has reached the highest level in both consciousness and technique, so it is not easy to understand without considerable appreciation ability. The level of music appreciation in our country is generally low. Except for a few "connoisseurs," most people feel half-understood or completely clueless when listening to a symphony performance.

To understand the content of a symphony, judge the merits of the performance, and understand and appreciate the fun, you must have knowledge in various aspects:

Regarding the method of performance, you must understand the types of instruments, timbre, individual functions, and special expressive power, etc. For example, the tone of the violin is gorgeous, affectionate, gentle, and beautiful; the tone of the cello is deep and enthusiastic; the tone of the pipe is simple and sad, full of pastoral flavor; the tone of the French horn is solemn and majestic, and has a sad feeling. ......

Regarding the form of the piece, you must understand the form of the music. Although the listener does not have to be a musician, he must at least be familiar with the form of a symphony: it is a large-scale piece of music played by an orchestra. The entire piece usually contains three or four movements: The first movement uses the allegro sonata form, the second movement uses the slow ternary form or variations, the third movement uses the allegretto minuet (Minuet) or scherzo (large ternary form), and the fourth movement uses the allegro rondo form.

Regarding the personality and style of the composer, you must have considerable knowledge of music history and have the ability to distinguish auditorily. For example, when listening to Beethoven's "Heroic Symphony" (No. 3), in addition to understanding the magnificent spirit, you must also understand the composer's political views, democratic ideas, and motivation for composing. For example, when listening to his "Fate Symphony" (No. 5), in addition to understanding the mood of suggestion and "fate" to end victory, you must also understand the composer's motivation and hope.

Regarding the types and schools of music, you must know the general outline, such as the difference between "homophonic music" and "polyphonic music": the former is the beauty of "harmony" (Harmony) lining, and the latter is the beauty of "counterpoint" interlacing. The difference between "absolute music" and "program music"; the former expresses abstraction, and the content and form are inseparable; the latter has specific titles to indicate the content, or write about love, or express emotions. Furthermore, the styles, strengths, and representative figures of the two major schools of music—the classical school and the romantic school—should also be known in general.

If you have the above-mentioned knowledge, you already have considerable appreciation ability, and of course you can get a lot of sublime fun from listening to symphony performances. As for wanting to be an excellent music critic, you must do a research effort on the entire content of the piece before the performance.

### Prison Overcrowding

— Liu Meng

According to reports, the prison, which was once sparsely populated due to amnesty, is now full again, and there are quite a few heroes who have committed numerous crimes.

To say something that doesn't make sense but makes sense, prison is the final destination for offenders; after being released from prison, they wander the streets again, so they "rehabilitate" and return to their old business, and as a result, they are arrested and re-enter prison.

Some say: "These people do not engage in proper business, and going to prison is not a big deal. They are harmful to the country and society and should be shot." But this is probably difficult to do. Moreover, those who are harmful to the country and society are not just these people!

### Manchukuo National Anthem

— Bai Yi

After the "September 18th" Incident, the Japanese invaders used Puyi, the deposed emperor of the Qing Dynasty, to establish the puppet state of Manchukuo in my Northeast. The puppet took the stage and made all kinds of ugly appearances. Yesterday, a guest told me: After the establishment of Manchukuo, it also compiled the so-called "national anthem" and forced the compatriots in the Northeast to sing it. The words are absurd, and the writing is not fluent. I don't know who wrote it. The song goes: "Within the heaven and earth, there is a new Manchukuo. The new Manchukuo is the new world; following heaven and standing on earth, there is no suffering and no worry. Creating our country, there is only love, and no hatred. The people number thirty million, and even if we work hard, we will get freedom. We value etiquette and uphold benevolence; we cultivate ourselves. Our families are in order, and our country is governed; what more can we ask for? We will assimilate with the world in the near future, and we will become desolate with the heaven and earth in the distant future!" At that time, the students in the Northeast all regarded Puyi's betrayal of his country and serving the enemy as a great shame and humiliation to China. Therefore, someone once changed the false national anthem to: "Within the heaven and earth, there is a big steamed bun; take the big steamed bun and feed it to the dog! The sky and the earth are full of bitterness and suffering! Creating this country, there is no love, only hatred! The people are a mixture (referring to the three nationalities of China, Japan, and Korea living together in the false Manchukuo) and even if they increase tenfold, they will not be free! What etiquette and courtesy is there that anyone still cultivates! The family is not in order, and the country is not governed; when will we raise our heads? We will assimilate with Korea in the near future, and we will be like the Jews in the distant future!" For a time, it was known to every household and sung everywhere, which shows that the compatriots outside the pass at that time had a full understanding of the truth about the false Manchukuo. It is a pity that they were under the iron fist of the enemy and could not do anything.

### New Interpretation of Diplomatic Terms

— Mi Xilin

The term "diplomat," in English, is "Diplomat," and according to historical research in diplomacy, it originated from Rome. Back then, diplomats were not as envied as they are today, especially in terms of living conditions, with strict limitations and many constraints.

Diplomacy often involves state secrets that must not be divulged. Therefore, European diplomats at the time were not allowed to bring their wives, to prevent the leakage of confidential information. This caused hardship for the imperial envoys. So, to reward officials dealing with foreign affairs, the government, in addition to lavish clothing and generous salaries, also allowed them to bring cooks to compensate for this spiritual deficiency with material enjoyment. But who would be willing to abandon their families and go to a foreign land? Therefore, Western historians express the "diplomat" of that time with a formula:

D is the diplomat (Diplomat), C is the cook (Cook), W is the wife (Wife).

Today, diplomats bringing their wives to banquets has become an international diplomatic etiquette, but bringing "cooks" has decreased. Therefore, modern Western historians say that the above formula should be changed to D W C.

### Age Hard to Know

— Hua

Male A: How old is your new girlfriend?

Male B: She said she has spent thirty-two summers! But later I heard that she spent most of her life in the Arctic.

### Eventful Autumn

— Jiang Juling

A friend told me that he has been receiving many invitations recently, either for a "celebration of his mother's fiftieth birthday" or a "joyful occasion of his young child's full month." I said he was fortunate to have such good fortune; couldn't he "feast heartily" when he "spares the time to attend"?

But he said that these hosts are all suffering from a "cash shortage" and resorted to this as a last resort. I then suddenly understood and could not help but smile knowingly. I said this is "autumn wind in spring," and my friend said these years are truly an "eventful autumn."

### Chronicle of a City in Danger

— Qin Shouou

He had a letter of introduction from the chief secretary of the Pacification Commissioner's Office, and Commander X had even scribbled two lines of thick black characters on the envelope with flamboyant strokes. Moreover, on his first visit, he had met Director Xiong, who was very polite and did not put on any airs. However, he still couldn't get the car! It wasn't that Director Xiong was deliberately making things difficult for him, but that there were too many people asking for cars, and each had a great background. Some were even people with great wealth and power. The business cards they presented would normally be more than enough to control this transport director who was only paid at the rank of lieutenant colonel. They could enter the director's office without waiting to be invited or hand over an official document and wait for the director to reply on the spot. This was something Lao Zhu couldn't do. Therefore, he could only wait again and again.

Today, he felt he could no longer endure it. He made a do-or-die decision to demand a definite "yes" or "no" answer from Director Xiong, who wielded considerable power.

The guests gradually left, and the junior staff in the large office to the left began to go out for dinner. Lao Zhu recognized this as an opportunity and suddenly pushed open the small door leading to the director's office, walking in with a beaming face.

Director Xiong didn't remember him at all and looked up with a puzzled gaze.

"Sorry! Director Xiong, I'm Zhu Zhaonian from the new planning group. It's about the car!" Lao Zhu spoke first.

"..." The person at the desk showed an impatient expression.

"Commander X has already approved it. We also talked about it last time!" Lao Zhu hurriedly added, sitting down on a small chair next to him.

The other's expression then softened somewhat.

"We have been waiting..."

The telephone on the desk rang, and Director Xiong's ear was stolen by someone else. Lao Zhu could only swallow the unfinished words, waiting blankly. This time, the phone call was particularly lengthy. Although Director Xiong said "goodbye" and "I will definitely take care of it later" to the other party several times, the other party kept chattering on and on. Lao Zhu glared at the oily black telephone line, really wanting to tear it off.

"This job is impossible to do! Damn it!" The young and vigorous Director Xiong threw down the telephone receiver angrily and said in a fit of rage.

This was too unfavorable for Lao Zhu! He thought that talking to the other party about his own affairs at this time would be like hitting a nail head-on. However, not talking was impossible. (61)

### Expensive Rice Meets Increased Appetite

— Zikai
