### U.S. Government and Public Unanimously Praise Our Emergency Economic Measures

[Associated Press, New York, 17th dispatch] All American newspapers today regard Chairman Chiang's emergency economic measures as the most important news. The headline on the front page of the New York Times today is "China Resumes Wartime Control Laws to Prevent Inflation." The World-Telegram reported: "Chairman Chiang Refreshes China's Economy," but the newspapers have not yet commented on this.

[Associated Press, Washington, 17th dispatch] Authoritative sources said that the U.S. government has not concealed its sympathy for Chairman Chiang's recent economic emergency measures. Chairman Chiang's emergency measures have undoubtedly won the sympathy of observers in the U.S. government and public. However, public opinion still doubts whether the Chinese government's institutions can handle this economic emergency plan competently. The conservative Evening Star was the first to comment, saying, "America's abandonment of mediation is the main factor in the recent devaluation of the legal tender." The newspaper also stated that China's economic instability is very beneficial to the Chinese Communist Party, which has always aimed to promote economic collapse in areas it does not control. Special Envoy Marshall criticized this in his statement before leaving China.

According to inquiries by this agency, due to Chairman Chiang's emergency measures, members of Congress have become more determined in their understanding of China, and their sympathy for the National Government has increased. Although Congress still has a dislike for a few reactionary elements in the Kuomintang, it feels that the United States must not allow China to become communist, nor can it allow the National Government to perish.

[Associated Press, New York, 17th dispatch] Business circles here today unanimously praised Chairman Chiang's economic emergency measures plan as a definite step. Business leaders said that they believe that the plan does not hinder importers and exporters, and that if it can be implemented, most of the regulations will be very beneficial. Business leaders expressed their approval of the abolition of export subsidies and the 50% import surcharge, believing that this move restored foreign trade to what it was a few weeks ago. Since the promulgation of the export subsidy, American importers have instructed their agents in China to suspend all business. Business leaders also said that this new economic measure is the most thorough method in China for many years and does not try to force conformity.

### Thirteenth Anniversary of the New Life Movement; Chairman's Letter to Fellow Countrymen

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 18th dispatch] On the thirteenth anniversary of the New Life Movement, Chairman Chiang's letter to fellow countrymen is as follows:

I, Zhongzheng, have advocated the New Life Movement for thirteen years now. The true essence of the New Life Movement is to awaken the self-consciousness of our people, transform our society, revive our nation, and build a new China that is independent, free, prosperous, and strong. In other words, it is to thoroughly reform everything in the consciousness, actions, and life of our people, so as to achieve the modernization of China. Looking back on the eight years of the War of Resistance, we went through all kinds of difficulties, and finally relied on the nationwide spirit to achieve victory. This shows that our national spirit and inherent morality have an indelible brilliance. Now, it has been almost two years since the victory. The external obstacles to national construction have long been eliminated, and the Constitution of the Republic of China has been formulated and promulgated. Our country is about to move towards civil politics and economic construction. All our compatriots must encourage themselves in their private lives to be modern citizens who do not fall behind, and shoulder the heavy responsibility of national security and national honor. I cannot help but express my earnest expectations on this day of this year.

Treat Speculators as Degenerates

The main purpose of the New Life Movement is to infuse etiquette, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame into the daily life of clothing, food, housing, and transportation. The tenets of the New Life Movement are neatness and cleanliness, simplicity and frugality, and speed and certainty. Our compatriots have long been accustomed to hearing this. In analysis, etiquette and righteousness show people the precepts of actively doing good, integrity and a sense of shame show people the scope of what cannot be done. Etiquette and righteousness encourage people not to be lazy or wasteful, integrity and a sense of shame encourage people not to speculate, not to take chances, not to be perfunctory, and not to be lucky. Being able to practice etiquette, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame will make you worthy of being a modern citizen with a sound mind and body.

As for the six tenets of the New Life Movement, neatness and cleanliness are the foundation for strengthening the body and managing the community. Its purpose is to enable everyone to cherish themselves and maintain their integrity. Simplicity and frugality are the principles for establishing oneself and managing affairs. Its purpose is to save money. Speed and certainty are the necessary conditions for work and production. Its purpose is diligence. Understanding these meanings, the strict implementation of the New Life Movement is not only to benefit oneself, but also to reform bad habits, restore declining customs, save the country from danger, and promote social progress. Therefore, all our compatriots should know what age this is, what time this is, and should know that all countries in the world are making rapid progress in order to seek progress. We should deeply regret why our country has so many worries and humiliations after the victory, unable to achieve peace and stability internally, and unable to maintain the respect of international friends externally. Understanding this meaning, we must deeply reflect and thoroughly awaken, we must strictly avoid empty talk and advocate hard work, we must reject hypocrisy and promote honesty, we must regard speculation as the behavior of social degenerates, and extravagance and waste as the actions of national traitors. In this time of national hardship and people's hardship, all our patriotic compatriots must take responsibility, abide by order, respect laws and regulations, and pay attention to discipline, to create an organized and orderly country. Our nation is a nation that can actively strive for progress. This is one.

Strictly Abide by Economic Laws and Regulations

The customs are declining, and this is the extreme. The suffering in the cities is particularly evident. For more than a year after the victory, we have not been able to eliminate the remnants of enemy and puppet poisoning. Luxury, extravagance, and waste are excessive. The suffering of our compatriots is ignored, and the material resources of the country are not cherished. If this is not changed for a long time, not only will national construction be hopeless, but we will also be doomed to ruin. All our compatriots should know that extravagance is the origin of national subjugation, and frugality is the foundation of national construction. We must strive for simplicity and advocate thrift. Looking at the friendly countries with abundant material resources, they still have rules for frugal clothing and food. How can our country, which is backward in production, indulge in waste, not cherish itself, and cut off the national foundation? The national economy has evolved to a serious state. Anyone who understands the general trend will know that the difficulties of this day are no less than the hard struggle of wartime. We must fully support and strictly abide by the state's laws and regulations on economic and financial control. Saving one point of material resources at this time means adding one point of glory in the future. This is two.

Labor-Capital Cooperation Eliminates Suspicion

Hands are omnipotent, the Father of the Nation's clear instruction. Production and construction are the foundation of prosperity and strength. Our country is currently experiencing dilapidated rural areas, dilapidated industries, and the Communist Party using illegal force to destroy transportation and factories. Production is declining day by day, and people's livelihood is becoming more difficult. Clothing and food needs are provided by foreign countries, and the huge amount of imports exceeds exports, which is shocking. If we do not seek to save ourselves, how can we stand on our own? Therefore, workers and peasants must redouble their hard work, work hard, increase production, and enrich national strength. In particular, labor and capital must cooperate to eliminate suspicion. Factory closures and strikes are not allowed. Following this path, the economic crisis can still be overcome, and the cause of national construction can be achieved. This is three.

In short, the country is now at a critical juncture of survival. Turning danger into safety depends on our awareness and efforts at this time. Thinking back to when I, Zhongzheng, initiated the New Life Movement in the 23rd year of the Republic of China, external Japanese invaders and internal bandits were rampant, and the general public had almost completely lost confidence. I saw this crisis and urgently sought to save it. More than ten years have passed, and the unprecedented foreign insults have finally been eliminated. The only problems today are the failure to restore peace and order and the economic life showing instability. However, things are done by people. Reviving the decline and revitalizing depends on the transformation of the minds of our people. Therefore, I sincerely advise you to resolve to act decisively, fathers and brothers to encourage each other, to form a style of honesty, diligence, and thrift, and to establish the foundation of national construction and self-reliance. The future of the country and the nation depends on it. February 18, 36th year of the Republic of China, Chiang Kai-shek.

Commemorative Meeting Held Grandly

### Measures for Handling Gold Shops; Ministry of Finance to Announce and Implement Soon

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 18th dispatch] The measures for handling gold shops and jewelry stores' finished gold jewelry will be announced and implemented soon. Gold shops in Beijing did not open for business on the 18th. The industry held a meeting to discuss various issues related to future business operations.

[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 18th dispatch] Gold shops in Beijing continued to close on the 18th. According to reports, there are a total of 72 gold shops in the city, employing more than 1,000 people. They held a meeting to discuss. According to the person in charge of the guild, in order to understand the country's difficulties, they should follow the order and wait for the handling of the new measures. However, they urgently hope that it will be announced as soon as possible, and at the same time, the unemployment problem of more than 1,000 people can be solved. The Ministry of Finance has recently sent personnel to investigate the gold stocks and accounts of gold shops throughout the city to determine whether there is manipulation or speculation. The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau sent personnel to express their condolences and urged them to wait for a solution.

### Deposits of Overseas Chinese in the United States Still Difficult to Transfer to Our Side

[Central News Agency, New York, 17th dispatch] Wall Street figures welcomed Chairman Chiang's emergency economic measures, calling them a "correct step" to stabilize China's economy. They believe that the Chinese government's new exchange rate (i.e., 11,000 legal tender equals one U.S. dollar) can be maintained. They also praised Chairman Chiang's decision to abolish government restrictions on private industry. When asked if American banks could assist the Chinese government in transferring Chinese private deposits in the United States to Chinese banks, the reply was that this method violates the principle of strict restrictions on transactions between banks and customers, so it is impossible to implement.

### The Markets in Various Places Are Calm

Fuzhou Gold Shops Stopped Trading Yesterday

[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 18th dispatch] The reporter recently visited Wang Yizhai, Chairman of the Beijing Chamber of Commerce, and asked him to talk about the reaction and impact of the Beijing business community after the announcement of the economic emergency plan. He said that the ban on the buying and selling of U.S. dollars and gold had little impact on the Beijing market, because the economic strength of the Beijing market is weak, and it has never made large-scale purchases of this kind. Therefore, the general business situation will not be greatly affected. He welcomed the method of rationing essential living goods, because if the government can control essential materials, then the prices of various goods will not rise arbitrarily. Even if U.S. dollars and gold are traded openly, they will be decoupled from daily necessities and will not have any impact. Wang concluded that the business situation in Beijing will not be adversely affected by the new measures.

[Our newspaper, Suzhou, 18th dispatch] Prices in Suzhou today generally trended downwards. The highest price for medium-grade white rice was 98,000 yuan, but all gold and silver businesses in the county were closed. The county price review committee announced the first evaluation on the 18th, which was slightly higher than the market price.

[Central News Agency, Fuzhou, 18th dispatch] More than 100 gold and silver shops here stopped trading completely on the 18th, waiting for the government's handling measures. The trading of U.S. dollars also stopped, and the Central Bank exchanged them at the legal price, but only a little over 1,000 yuan was exchanged throughout the day.

[Central News Agency, Qingdao, 18th dispatch] The Qingdao branch of the Central Bank began to exchange U.S. dollars on the 18th. The total amount of cash exchanged today was over 30,000 yuan.

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 18th dispatch] The Central Bank has received a telegram from the head office stating that the exchange price for U.S. dollars is set at 11,640 yuan. The price of gold was not mentioned. Gold shops stopped trading once on the morning of the 18th because the handling measures for jewelry have not yet been announced.

[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 18th dispatch] The Tianjin Municipal Government received the order to implement the economic emergency measures on the 18th and convened relevant parties at 4:00 p.m. to discuss the implementation methods.

Grain prices have fallen, but retail prices have not changed much.

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 18th dispatch] The Beiping branch of the Central Bank began to exchange U.S. dollars at 9:00 a.m. on the 18th. Based on the exchange rate, and deducting 3% for shipping costs, each U.S. dollar was actually exchanged for 11,640 yuan in national currency. The bank has not yet received orders for the purchase of gold, so it has been temporarily postponed.

[Central News Agency, Kunming, 18th dispatch] After receiving the plan to implement economic emergency measures, the Kunming branch of the Central Bank began to exchange gold and U.S. dollars today. A total of over 34,000 yuan in silver and over 5,800 yuan in U.S. dollars were exchanged in one day. No gold was purchased. The exchange rate for British pounds was 46,000 yuan.

### Gold Stocks Increase in Hong Kong; Prices Fall for Several Days

[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 18th dispatch] The Hong Kong industrial, commercial, and financial sectors attach great importance to the announcement of the economic measures plan. Because the buying and selling of gold and foreign currencies are prohibited in the country, Hong Kong gold has lost its largest market, so the prices of gold and U.S. dollars have fallen for several days. The current gold reserves in Hong Kong have reached 200,000 ounces. Another 200,000 ounces of gold have been ordered and are being shipped in one after another. At the same time, gold from the mainland may also flow back to Hong Kong. It is expected that gold prices will continue to trend downwards. There are very few people buying gold in the financial market.

### U.S. Food Delegation to Visit Shanghai; Mr. Fouilhoux, President of the Far East Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Said: The United States Has Ample Power to Assist the East

The governments of Eastern countries have taken steps to improve the living conditions of their people. Therefore, he urged Americans to provide assistance to this effort.

### Ambassador Koo Visits U.S. Secretary of State, Makes Five Appeals for Aid to China, $500 Million Loan Also Discussed

[United States Information Service, Washington, 17th] Dr. V.K. Wellington Koo, Chinese Ambassador to the United States, met with Secretary of State Marshall today for an hour, discussing matters of mutual interest to China and the United States. Also present was Mr. Walton Butterworth, Director of the Office of Far Eastern Affairs. When asked if China's financial crisis caused by hyperinflation of the legal tender was one of the issues discussed, the Ambassador said, "This is of course a matter of concern to both countries." He said that China's financial and economic situation has always been a matter of concern to the United States, and China is grateful for the United States' assistance in this regard. The Ambassador said that the United States can help China solve its economic crisis and explore various possibilities for assistance. He said that they did not discuss the use of the $500 million loan from the Export-Import Bank to China, and he would refer further questions on this matter to the Secretary of State. Dr. Koo said that they discussed the general situation of China's economy and industry, and how to improve it. Regarding the issue of war reparations from Japan, the Ambassador said that he hoped that the payment of such reparations and the transfer of electrical, textile, and other machinery to China would begin soon. When this machinery will begin to be transferred to China will be determined by the reparations organization under the direction of General MacArthur in Tokyo.

[United Press, Washington, 17th] Authoritative sources say that the U.S. State Department is now considering strengthening President Chiang's austerity economic measures with a "gesture of spiritual support" to save China's collapsing economy. They doubt whether the United States will provide any material economic assistance to China, but expect some action to show U.S. sympathy for the situation. Regarding this matter, it is reported that Wellington Koo made five appeals for U.S. assistance to China's current situation during a lengthy meeting with Marshall.

[Associated Press, Washington, 17th] Secretary of State Marshall met with Chinese Ambassador V.K. Wellington Koo for an hour today to discuss the issue of assisting China in resolving its economic crisis. Ambassador Koo told reporters afterwards that the discussion concerned matters of mutual interest to both countries, and that the issue of the $500 million U.S. loan to China was also discussed. The United States needs a satisfactory solution to China's political and economic stability as a prerequisite for the Export-Import Bank to extend the loan. At the same time, according to senior government officials, China has not yet asked the United States to freeze the deposits of Chinese people in the United States so that the National Government can control all foreign exchange held by Chinese people abroad. The initial reaction of the U.S. side to China's economic emergency measures can be described as attentive observation without comment. Trade experts at the State Department say they are awaiting an official report of President Chiang's important statement and are unable to comment at this time. The American press is paying close attention to these measures by the Chinese government. Officials in charge of Far Eastern trade at the Department of Commerce held a meeting on Monday, but the content has not been announced. Officials at the Chinese Embassy are also remaining silent about the situation in China, only saying that President Chiang's statement is a major decision. The U.S. government is unwilling to express any position on what it considers to be purely within the scope of China's internal affairs, implying that it intends to exert its influence on these internal affairs, even in the future. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has not received a report on the development of the situation in China, but has reiterated that American businesses have high hopes for trade with China.

### Intensifying the Ban on the Sale of Enemy and Puppet Materials

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 18th] According to the Economic Emergency Measures Plan, the enemy and puppet industries should be auctioned off by the competent authorities.

Since June 5th of last year, a total of 23 auctions have been held, yielding 5.15 billion yuan; 15 auctions of furniture have yielded 142.5 million yuan. Enemy and puppet real estate has not yet been processed because most of the cases of Chinese traitors have not been concluded. It is reported that all enemy property disposal work is scheduled to end by the end of March. Its conclusion should not be too late.

### Government Opens Up New Tax Sources, Luxury Goods Will Be Taxed

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 18th] It is reported that in the Economic Emergency Measures Plan, for the item of opening up new tax sources, taxes may be increased on luxury goods, cosmetics, and the like. If the price of these items increases due to taxation, it should not affect daily life.

### Newly Appointed Canadian Ambassador Arrives in China to Assume Office

### Minister Bai Arrives in Shanghai from Nantong, Inspects Naval Institutions Today, Wang Maogong Arrives Together and Returns to Town That Evening

[Central News Agency, This City News] Minister of National Defense and Director of the Pacification Zone Supervision Group Bai Chongxi arrived in Shanghai from Nantong at 3:30 PM yesterday aboard the "Minquan" warship. Those who came with him included Zheng Zhenyu, Director of the Land Administration Department, Wang Maogong, Chairman of Jiangsu Province, and Lei Gu, Director of the First Group of the Pacification Zone Supervision Group, and more than forty other people. It is reported that Mr. Bai will stay in Shanghai for several days. He is scheduled to inspect the naval base, the Naval Academy, and the Jiangnan Shipyard and other institutions this morning (the 19th), and go to the Central Training Corps for inspection in the afternoon. He is scheduled to return to Nanjing on the 21st by special military plane. However, according to naval sources, Gui Yongqing, Acting Commander-in-Chief of the Navy, will come to Shanghai from Taiwan on the 22nd. Mr. Bai may wait in Shanghai to meet with Mr. Gui before returning to Nanjing on the 23rd.

Director Bai led 21 staff members to Zhenjiang on the 13th of this month, where he met with 20 members of the First Group of the Supervision Group and went to the northern Jiangsu Pacification Zone for inspection. After visiting Nantong, Rugao, Haimen and other counties, he carefully investigated the administrative situation of the Pacification Zones, and convened several meetings to listen to opinions from local people. The impressions he gained were very profound. Whether the administrative guidelines of the Pacification Zone are in line with the actual situation, the Central Government will make certain modifications based on Mr. Bai's report, so as to enable the people in the recovered areas to quickly stabilize their lives.

All members of the First Group of the Supervision Group departed from Nanjing on the first of this month, and after arriving in Yangzhou, they were divided into three subgroups to inspect Taixian, Dongtai, Gaoyou, Shiying, Xinghua, Jiancheng, Huaian, Huaiyin, Lianshui and other places. The materials collected were very rich, and the devastation in the newly recovered areas made the members feel very emotional. The reporter yesterday interviewed various members who arrived in Shanghai. Their conclusion is that the land problem in the newly recovered areas of northern Jiangsu is the most serious. The land disposal methods in the administrative guidelines of the Pacification Zone are quite difficult to implement. Secondly, the problems of local financial support, the unsoundness of administrative personnel at all levels, etc., make it impossible to implement good governance, and various malpractices are bound to arise. It is reported that the group will return to Nanjing in the coming days and submit specific recommendations to the government. After a short rest, they will go to the Lu-Yu Pacification Zone to continue supervision.

[Another Dispatch] Chairman of Jiangsu Province Wang Maogong arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon and paid a visit to President Song that evening to report on the inspection. He then took the 11:00 PM night train back to Zhenjiang. According to Mr. Wang before leaving, the policy of stabilizing prices in the counties along the Beijing-Shanghai line will be strictly enforced in the future.

### Our Strong Note to the Philippines, Criticizing the Philippines for Harming the Interests of Overseas Chinese, Negotiations Difficult to Continue Under Current Circumstances

[Central News Agency, Manila, 18th] Our Minister to the Philippines Chen Zhiping, in accordance with the instructions of the government, submitted a strongly worded note to Philippine Foreign Minister Quirino at 10:30 this morning, stating that under the current circumstances, the Chinese government has no choice but to temporarily suspend negotiations on the Sino-Philippine Treaty of Friendship. The note stated that it is currently difficult for the Chinese government to reach an agreement with the Philippine government on the various clauses of the treaty, because the Philippine negotiators have repeatedly changed the clauses they proposed, and have repeatedly withdrawn clauses that had previously been agreed upon jointly with the Chinese negotiators. The note criticized the Philippine government for even taking various measures to harm the interests of overseas Chinese in the Philippines during the negotiations. Such measures are completely inconsistent with the Philippine government's repeated expression of its desire to promote Sino-Philippine relations. However, the Chinese government sincerely hopes that the Philippine government can take various steps to eliminate various obstacles that may harm genuine Sino-Philippine friendship. Under the current circumstances, the Chinese government has no choice but to temporarily suspend negotiations on the Sino-Philippine Treaty of Friendship.

On the 17th, at the joint welcome meeting of the chiefs of the Party, government, and military groups in Chongqing, he made a statement on the situation in Sichuan and Kang, the main points of which are as follows: (1) Regarding the Sichuan Chairman, his request to resign has been submitted but not approved. Chairman Deng Xihou of the Sichuan-Kang Pacification Office will continue to serve as acting chairman. The Sichuan Provincial Government will not be reorganized. (2) During my visit to Chengdu this time, I convened the Sichuan-Kang Pacification Conference to discuss the issue of security. Practical measures have been decided. Under the guidance of Director Deng at the Executive Headquarters, he will be responsible for implementation and will definitely have a firm grasp.

Sufficient Local Finances

(3) Regarding financial issues, the income and expenditure of the provincial government are unbalanced and can still be subsidized by the central government. If the income and expenditure of the county and local governments cannot be self-sufficient and they hope for central government subsidies, it will be very difficult. It has now been decided to increase the powers of the administrative inspectors of various regions, ordering them to supervise and guide the counties under their jurisdiction, to effectively organize local finances, and strive to balance the budget and enrich local expenditures to stabilize the lives of public school staff. (4) Now is the preparation period for the implementation of constitutional government. Regarding the completion of local autonomy and all matters that should be promoted, we have discussed with all parties in the Party and government a method of cooperating and working together to jointly promote them. In the exercise of the people's political power, we must establish a foundation for promoting constitutional government based on the principle of universal justice.

Regarding the Xikang Incident

(5) Regarding the Xikang incident, the results obtained through investigation and investigation by all parties are mainly due to the strict enforcement of opium eradication last year. Cheng Zhiwu, Li Yuanheng and others who initiated the rebellion are all long-term bandits. They used this opportunity to call upon each other and take the opportunity to cause chaos. In the Pacification Conference convened in Chengdu this time, it was decided to distinguish between good and bad. The Sichuan-Kang Pacification Office will be responsible for supervising and urging the elimination of bandits. For the people who were coerced by the bandits and the counties affected by the bandits, Kang Provincial Chairman Liu Wenhui will be responsible for comforting them. All post-disaster relief matters will be handled by the Kang Provincial Government. Chairman Liu has been in charge of Xikang for many years. Due to this unfortunate incident, after this stimulation, he feels that there are still many provinces that need to be determined politically. He has decided to convene the Speaker and Deputy Speaker of the Xikang Provincial Assembly, the Speakers of the Ya'an County Assemblies, representatives of the Xikang people in Rong, and responsible Party and government personnel on March 1 to hold a political review meeting to seek innovation. The Executive Headquarters believes after investigation that it is necessary to effectively rectify the military affairs in Kang Province. We should earnestly rectify in accordance with the central government's military reorganization plan in order to achieve the purpose of protecting the people and ensuring security. The handling of Kang affairs is nothing more than [suppressing bandits, pacifying the people, revitalizing politics, and rectifying the army]. If we work hard in these areas, we will be able to live up to the government's expectations and the hopes of the people of Kang.

### Enhancing Spiritual and Moral Strength - Reflections on the 13th Anniversary of the New Life Movement

After eight years of the long War of Resistance and more than a year since victory, the crises facing China appear to be deepening. After a long night, after welcoming the dawn of victory, it seems that the haze is gathering again, entering another long night. It seems a bit like the Arctic winter, always living in a long night. It is no wonder that people in this situation are prone to depression and despair. However, even the Arctic winter has long summer months, full of Arctic sunshine. The current situation in China may inevitably make people depressed and sad; but we cannot despair because of this. Even if we enter another long night; but where there is night, there must be dawn. We are all keenly aware of the current crisis. We must overcome these crises to welcome the coming of light. Human beings live and continue in hope; in today's difficult times, we should hold firm to the new hope for the construction of a new China. Where can this new hope come from? A simple answer is: we must enhance our spiritual and moral strength. Starting from this source to rectify our lives and implement our new life, we will have a new hope for everything around us. It is in this sense that after the government announced emergency economic measures, we commemorate the thirteenth anniversary of the New Life Movement, which is particularly touching and meaningful.

The root cause of all the maladies in China today lies in the human heart. The chaos in the economic sector, the political turmoil, and the low administrative efficiency, a major factor in this is the badness of the human heart. Because the human heart is bad, no matter how good the policies of the government are, the results of implementation are often far from the expected goals. Therefore, all the government's policies will be in vain if they do not start with the reform of the human heart. Regarding the current economic crisis, we have argued that political measures are no less important than economic measures, and in a sense, politics is more important than economics. However, if political measures do not begin with the reform of the human heart as a prerequisite, then all good and beautiful policies will be implemented in a way that is contrary to the expected purpose. Therefore, Dr. Sun Yat-sen said: "Spiritual strength is more important than material things, and revolution must first reform the heart." From today onwards, we should vigorously implement the reform of the heart; and the reform of the heart must start from me. I must first reform my life and behavior, vigorously implement the New Life Movement, and then can I use my new life and behavior to express my "reform of the heart." "Heart" and "action" are two in one, and only through the innovation of a person's behavior can we ultimately know the innovation of his heart.

On the eve of the 13th anniversary of the New Life Movement, our Chairman, despite being burdened with numerous affairs, still broadcasted to the nation, mentioning the importance of reforming the people. "The policies of politicians in our country in the past dynasties also took changing customs as the first task, because the foundation of the country lies in society. If society cannot establish good customs, and the people cannot be accustomed to modern life, then the country can never be modernized. However, since the end of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the remaining poison of the enemy and puppets has not been eradicated, and the order of the country has not been stabilized; as a result, the atmosphere has become decadent, the spirit has become depressed, the human heart has become weak, and society has become degenerate. Those who speculate and seek advantages think they are capable; those who indulge in depravity are shameless. Rituals, righteousness, humility, and shame have been swept away." Our Chairman has fully explained the maladies of the current society. Examining why the people's lives are so corrupt, the main factor lies in the disappointment with real life, from disappointment to despair, from despair to corruption. Therefore, at present, we must turn despair into hope, holding a firm new hope; but we also hope that the government can rectify discipline and make the world able to distinguish between right and wrong. If the government's policies have a distinction between right and wrong, then discipline will not be lost, and the human heart can also be maintained. "Reform of the heart" is a kind of behavior, and the reason why there is such a behavior depends on two factors: external and internal. In terms of internal factors, we can have subjective reform of the heart, but if there are no external factors, then subjective reform of the heart, except for those who are naturally blessed, seems not easy to achieve. Therefore, in order to make everyone have the automatic reform of the heart, we must pay attention to the external factors. This is that we must have all kinds of environmental factors that enable people to reform their hearts, we must have all kinds of external signs that lead people to have the possibility of reforming their hearts, and then can we hope that people can have "reform of the heart."

But the heart is originally subjective; and the reform of the heart is especially a subjective behavior. In today's world, if we feel that all the symptoms are entirely due to the soil of the human heart, then we must first innovate or reform the heart. We cannot rely on external factors, but must first seek self-reform and self-innovation from spontaneous internal factors. The result of this self-innovation is the practice of a self-new life. We cannot give up the practice of the New Life Movement because others do not practice the New Life Movement; if everyone does this, the New Life Movement will never be possible to practice. We must start from ourselves, start from my practice. The essence of the New Life Movement is to incorporate rituals, righteousness, integrity, and shame into daily life. Rituals, righteousness, integrity, and shame are the inherent morality of our country. Some people suspect that the advocacy of the New Life Movement is a return to the past. What we want to point out here is that human life must have moral standards, and there is no distinction between new and old in moral standards. In a new era, we still want to maintain the old morality; because morality is neither new nor old. The interpretation of the virtue of morality may be different, but its value has never changed. The hope for China's future depends on the success of the New Life Movement.

For the sake of China's future, the New Life Movement is only allowed to succeed, not allowed to fail. How to make it succeed lies in enhancing the spiritual and moral strength. This is reflected in the social aspect, and also reflected in the personal aspect. In short, the practice of the New Life Movement must start from ourselves.

### US-Soviet Relations Still Unclear; Marshall Plans to Meet Stalin Directly; US Protest Response Delivered to Moscow

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 17th] Well-informed sources recently said that US Secretary of State Marshall has requested Stalin to meet with him alone during the Moscow Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference, so as to improve US-Soviet relations through personal contact.

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 17th] Regarding the recent statement by US Under Secretary of State Acheson, criticizing the Soviet government for adopting a policy of "aggression and territorial expansion." The Soviet authorities have protested to the United States for this. According to responsible sources here, the content must be made public after it is delivered to Foreign Minister Molotov. This is the first diplomatic document issued by Marshall since he took office as Secretary of State. According to Acheson's previous announcement, the State Department will issue a bulletin to explain the Soviet protest. However, it is reported that Marshall prefers to personally reply to the Soviet government, rather than issue a bulletin in Washington or order his subordinates to draft a reply. US-Soviet relations are still generally unclear, and the US Senate and House of Representatives will discuss them during the meeting of the two houses. At that time, Marshall will address the congressmen again. Marshall is currently preparing his response to the inquiries to be submitted to the House Foreign Affairs Committee. It is expected that some members of Congress will propose a "give and take" policy toward the Soviet Union. It is heard that Marshall will provide assurances to the congressmen that the State Department is giving special consideration to US-Soviet relations and the Soviet newspapers' attacks on the United States.

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 17th] Regarding the Soviet Union's protest against US Under Secretary of State Acheson's criticism of the Soviet Union for adopting a policy of territorial expansion, according to people close to Acheson, Acheson only used the term "expansion of power" when he made a statement on Soviet policy to Congress, and did not use the term "territorial expansion."

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 18th] US Secretary of State Marshall is finding it difficult to find a Republican to serve as an advisor to accompany him to Moscow to participate in the meeting. Republican giant Vandenberg has stated that he will not go to Moscow, and other figures such as Dulles are not enough to represent the entire Republican congressional delegation. Marshall is also unwilling to choose arbitrarily, lest he interfere in party politics.

### Revision of the Alliance Treaty; Britain and the Soviet Union Begin Negotiations; Anglo-French Alliance Aims to Prevent German Aggression

[Agence France-Presse, London, 17th] Well-informed sources recently said that British Ambassador to the Soviet Union Peterson has begun talks with Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov to discuss the revision of the Anglo-Soviet Treaty. Stalin has written to British Foreign Secretary Bevin, advocating the revision of the Anglo-Soviet Alliance Treaty.

[Reuters, Paris, 17th] Reliable sources say: The French government's draft of the Anglo-French Alliance Treaty suggests that the alliance should last for twenty years, with the intention of preventing German aggression. The French draft treaty is very similar to the French-Soviet Alliance Treaty in terms of wording and meaning, stipulating that neither contracting party shall participate in any alliance system that opposes the other party. The main difference is that the Anglo-French Alliance Treaty incorporates the alliance relationship into the scope of the United Nations organization. In addition, it also stipulates economic cooperation between the two countries. Responsible parties in Paris believe that the effectiveness of the alliance will depend on the situation after the alliance is concluded. If the cooperation between the British and French industrial plans and policies towards Germany can be implemented one by one after the conclusion of the alliance, the effect of the alliance will be more important.

### US State Department; Streamlining Personnel

Two Hundred People Have Resigned

[United Press, Washington, 17th] A State Department spokesman said that since the State Department began investigating people suspected of having "unclear backgrounds," only two people have been found to have reasons to be dismissed. About two hundred people have left the department voluntarily for various reasons, and some personnel resigned immediately after being questioned.

[United Press, Washington, 18th] The US Department of Commerce today released a 57-page report accusing 400 Communist Party members who have infiltrated government agencies and occupied important positions of being loyal only to the Soviet Union and using their government positions to benefit foreign countries. The report urges Congress to thoroughly investigate the infiltration of the Communist Party into the State Department, the Department of Commerce, and other agencies.

### US and Canada Exchange Military Officers

[Reuters, Ottawa, 18th] Defense Minister Claxton said today that the United States and Canada are engaging in the first exchange of military personnel in peacetime. Twelve US Army officers will come to Canadian Army Headquarters in Ottawa, and Canada will also send fourteen Army officers to US Army Headquarters in Washington.

### US Presidential Term; Limited to Two Terms

Senate Judiciary Committee Passes

[United Press, Washington, 17th] The Senate Judiciary Committee recently passed a bill by a vote of nine to one, limiting the US presidential term to no more than eight years. The limitation bill had already been passed by the House of Representatives. The Judiciary Committee also passed an amendment, that is, if the president serves less than one year in one term, he can be re-elected for two terms. Both of the above restrictions are sufficient to limit President Truman to only one term after 1949.

### Dutch Princess Gives Birth to a Daughter

[Agence France-Presse, The Hague, 18th] Dutch Princess Juliana gave birth to another daughter last night. This is the fourth daughter of the princess and Prince Bernhard. If the princess does not produce a boy in the future, the Netherlands will be ruled by women for three generations.

### Voice of America; Begins Broadcasting to the Soviet Union; Aims to Promote Understanding Between the Two Countries

[United Press, Washington, 17th] The Voice of America, the shortwave radio station of the US State Department, began broadcasting to the people of the Soviet Union in Russian today. It is heard that when Moscow listened, it was greatly disturbed and mixed with the sounds of European radio stations. The first broadcast in the United States had a discussion of 2,000 words on "National Rights" and a report on world news, interspersed with several records. According to the United Press correspondent in Moscow, the United States' attempt to use radio as a tool to cross the Soviet Union's "Iron Curtain" has attracted the attention of the Soviet Union. The US broadcast, in addition to being hindered by the atmosphere, was also blocked by French and Soviet radio stations. The correspondent mentioned three impressions of the Soviet people on the program as follows: (1) Too arrogant; (2) The reporter is too amateurish; (3) Generally interesting. The broadcast introduction quoted Secretary of State Marshall as saying that the United States will "try to provide the people of the world with pure facts."

### US Secretary of the Interior Departs for Japan; Related to the Trusteeship of Former Japanese Islands; US Proposes Draft Agreement Due to Domestic Political Reasons

[United Press, Long Beach, California, 18th] Secretary of the Interior Krug is scheduled to fly to Japan this morning to meet with MacArthur to collect information for the United States' possible administration of the former Japanese islands in the Pacific. Krug will stop briefly in Honolulu on his way west, but said he will stay in Hawaii longer on his return trip to obtain information on the possibility of the Hawaiian Islands becoming a US state.

[Reuters, Lake Success, New York, 17th] The United States today submitted to the United Nations a trusteeship plan for the former Japanese islands in the Pacific, which, in addition to specifying defense details, also contains provisions on the economic, social, and political life of the local residents, and suggests that the administration of all 650 islands be regarded as an integral part of the US administration.

[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 18th] According to people close to the US delegation, the reason why the United States submitted to the United Nations a draft trusteeship for the former Japanese mandated islands was due to domestic political reasons. The US draft has aroused formal protests from the British, Soviet, and Australian governments, and the US's decision to submit it regardless of everything has also aroused criticism from most delegations. US officials pointed out that the State Department strongly supports this draft agreement, while the US military advocates immediately merging the islands. Supporters of the draft agreement believe that the United States can only do this to avoid accusations of imperialism and show obedience to the UN Charter. People outside the United States believe that it is doubtful whether the Security Council has the right to terminate Japan's mandate and grant the trusteeship to the United States. US officials stressed that this kind of opposition is being fully considered, so the US government is only asking for this issue to be included in the Security Council's peace negotiations and does not insist on immediate discussion.

### US Should Aid Democratic Countries

Congressman Judd Advocates

[United Press, Huntington, West Virginia, 18th] Republican Congressman Judd said in a speech at Marshall University here today that the United States "should clearly explain to all parties that we will assist the democratic countries in Europe," but "we will not assist these countries in their imperial policies in Asia." Britain, France, and the Netherlands are the main protagonists in promoting colonialism in the post-war era. If most of Asia is forced to return to the old colonial form, then "Asia will explode, and the impact on the United States will be the same as the impact on Britain, France, and the Netherlands." "The military part of World War II has ended, and the war of ideas and politics that shakes the world is now underway to determine who truly wins the victory in this military war. Any country whose ideas can control the revival of Europe and the development of Asia's huge human resources and potential markets is the one that ultimately defeats Germany and Japan. This struggle is particularly fierce in the following three key areas: (1) Germany—its outcome will determine the fate of Europe... (2) China—its direction will guide the direction of Asia... (3) The United States—its direction will guide the direction of the Western Hemisphere. The struggle of ideas that will determine our future domestic and foreign policies has a great, perhaps even decisive, influence on determining the path that Germany and China will follow." Congressman Judd once served as a medical missionary in China and has repeatedly given speeches advocating unconditional recognition, assistance, and concessions to the National Government of China by the United States.

### Platinum Discovered in East Africa

[Agence France-Presse, London, 18th] Platinum deposits have been discovered in the Chambe Mountains of Tanganyika, a British mandated territory in East Africa. Samples have been sent to London for identification, and the government has ordered a ban on anyone collecting mineral resources in the area.

### Japan to Immediately Restore Private Foreign Trade: MacArthur's Headquarters Trade Management Office Announces

[United Press, Tokyo, 17th] Mr. Bickel, Deputy Director of the Trade Management Office at MacArthur's Headquarters, announced today: Limited private trade between foreign and Japanese merchants will be restored in the near future. The exact date cannot yet be specified, but it is expected to be implemented this summer. Headquarters will allow a small number of merchants to come to Japan to purchase certain designated goods. All private trade will require export permits issued by the Japanese government, and this system will be approved by MacArthur's Headquarters. The coexistence of governmental and private trade will be permitted. Most countries in the Far Eastern Commission currently have liaison missions stationed in Japan to discuss trade issues with Headquarters. This private trade will not be denominated in Japanese Yen. Headquarters may set prices, and merchants can pay Headquarters using letters of credit.

British Merchants to Also Restore Old Relationships with Japan

[United Press, London, 17th] A Foreign Office spokesman announced today: The British request to restore trade with Japan has been met with a satisfactory response from the U.S. State Department. British merchants will be able to send representatives to Japan to restore old relationships and develop import and export trade. This will benefit Britain and accelerate Japan's economic recovery. However, as of yet, MacArthur's Headquarters has not made any statement. Headquarters has historically prohibited the entry of all Allied merchants due to the lack of food and housing. Even American commerce has been managed by government-run trading companies since the victory. These companies represent the government in controlling Japan's import and export trade. Almost all of Japan's imports are supplied by the United States, and the United States purchases approximately 65% of Japan's exports. The remainder of the exports are shipped to Korea, China, and the Soviet Union.

### German Leaders in British and American Zones Decide Not to Sign Peace Treaty

[Our Own Report] London, 18th (Broadcast): The chairmen of the eight states within the British and American occupation zones of Germany held an informal meeting and decided to refuse to sign the German peace treaty if requested by the Four Powers, and will refuse to accept any invitation to attend the Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference.

### Preamble to Austrian Peace Treaty: Six Clauses Passed

[Agence France-Presse, London, 17th] The Four Deputy Foreign Ministers discussed the preamble to the Austrian Peace Treaty this morning, and immediately passed six of its clauses. The remaining three clauses did not reach an agreement.

[Our Own Report] London, 18th (Broadcast): The Four Powers' Deputy Foreign Ministers have reached an agreement allowing Austria to have armed ground forces. However, the responsibility of these forces and whether Austria will be allowed to establish an air force were not agreed upon.

### British Troops Stationed in Greece to Withdraw Before End of May: Greek Government Has Not Yet Received Notification

[Agence France-Presse, London, 17th] It was officially announced that all British troops stationed in Greece, except for one brigade, will be withdrawn before the end of May. Foreign Secretary Bevin announced a few days ago at a closed-door meeting of Labour Party members that the British troops in Greece would be completely withdrawn within 90 days.

[Agence France-Presse, Athens, 18th] Regarding the decision of British troops to withdraw from Greece between March 1st and June 1st of this year, the Greek Prime Minister stated that he has not yet received notification.

### Restoration of Spanish Monarchy Imminent: Carlos to Ascend to Throne; Franco to Be One of Three Regents; Former Finance Minister Lairas to Assume Office as Prime Minister

According to reliable sources: Regarding the talk of the restoration of the Spanish monarchy, Carlos will ascend to the throne, and the widowed Queen Victoria, Franco, and former Finance Minister Lairas will jointly serve as regents. Lairas will also assume the office of Prime Minister. Don Juan will not abdicate. If his son dies before reaching adulthood, then Don Juan will ascend to the throne.

### American Train Derails: Red Arrow

[Our Own Report] San Francisco, 18th (Broadcast): The "Red Arrow" express train, traveling from Detroit to New York, derailed near Altoona, Pennsylvania, tonight, resulting in multiple deaths and injuries.

### U.S. Compensation Committee Drafts New Compensation Plan for Japan: Aims to Make Japan Self-Sufficient; Fundamentally Different from Pauley Plan

[Kaizo-sha, Tokyo, 18th] The five members of the American Compensation Committee, Mr. Streicher (Manager of Macklowe Corporation), Mr. Macklear, Mr. Burgess, Colonel Tissedaen, and Major Klaus, who came to Japan on January 28th to inspect Japanese factories and production equipment, spoke to reporters today through Mr. Streicher, representing the five: All five members came to Japan from a technical standpoint to study the Japanese compensation issue. The scope of this inspection included industrial equipment, private property, factories designated for compensation (including those still operating and those that have ceased operations), and factories not designated. The results of the investigation have been reported to MacArthur's Headquarters and will be submitted to the Department of the Army after returning to the United States. It is currently not necessary to publish the contents of the report in detail, but the report can be considered the best report based on the current situation. Mr. Streicher then answered reporters' questions as follows:

(Question) The Japanese believe that Commissioner Pauley's plan will have a devastating impact on Japan. What does the Compensation Committee think? (Answer) The basis of our investigation is to allow Japan to retain industries sufficient for self-sufficiency.

(Question) Considering the previous compensation plans made by the Allies, which are being re-examined, how will the Compensation Committee designate factories for compensation? (Answer) We are not involved in designating factories. Our mission is to submit a report to the U.S. Department of the Army, which stipulates Japan's industrial level, and not to re-designate factories. The main point of our plan is to enable Japan, composed of the four major islands, to be self-sufficient and to export in order to import.

(Question) What is the extent of the damage to the factories designated for compensation? (Answer) It varies from factory to factory.

(Question) Where is Japan's industrial level placed? (Answer) We do not trace back to 1894 (Sino-Japanese War) or 1914 (World War I). On the one hand, 1930 should be taken into consideration, and the situation in 1950 should also be considered.

(Question) Is the report made by the Compensation Committee this time fundamentally different from Commissioner Pauley's plan? (Answer) It is fundamentally different. However, whether our plan is more lenient than Pauley's plan should be judged by each individual.

(Question) If the self-sufficient economy of Japan in 1950 is determined, where will the Japanese standard of living be placed? (Answer) It must be based on history and data. What was the level of life for the Japanese in the mid-1930s should also be considered.

(Question) How long will it take to dismantle the compensation equipment? (Answer) Unknown.

(Question) Does the Department of the Army believe that the compensation equipment needs to be re-investigated? (Answer) Unknown. However, it is a fact that the U.S. Department of the Army gathered technicians on December 25th last year and put forward a suggestion.

(Question) Can the views of the U.S. Department of the Army be interpreted as a change of direction? (Answer) It is felt that it is necessary to observe from a technical perspective.

(Question) Has consideration been given to conducting a survey of Japanese compensation equipment? (Answer) How the compensation equipment is distributed should be decided by the Far Eastern Commission.

(Question) Some believe that dismantling the compensation equipment and reinstalling it to start production will take a considerable amount of time. Therefore, it would be better to leave it in Japan and take its products. What does the Compensation Committee think? (Answer) This point has been studied, but it is not suitable to write in the report.

(Question) Will the textile equipment be dismantled? (Answer) There is no need to reduce Japan's textile production capacity.

(Question) After inspecting various parts of Japan, do you think the compensation equipment is not very useful? (Answer) This shows that the press corps is very clever.

### Ministry of Finance Responsible for Inspecting Banks and Firms: 5 Billion Overdraft Can Be Restored; Rumor of Confiscating Gold in Vaults is False: Vice Minister of Finance Received Financial Sector Yesterday to Dissipate Doubts

[Our Own Report] Yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, Vice Minister of Finance Xu Boyuan and Director of the Currency Department Dai Mingli hosted representatives from both the banking and money industries in the conference room of the Joint Administration Office. Chairman Xu Boyuan first gave a speech, stating that the Ministry of Finance's thorough investigation of banks and firms is intended to protect the reputation of legitimate banking and money businesses and to thoroughly implement future government orders. In order, the operations of national banks and provincial and municipal public banks will be examined first. The inspection work will avoid hindering the daily operations of each bank and firm, and it is hoped that the heads of each bank and firm will assist.

### Representatives of Both Industries Frankly Expressed Opinions

After the speech, Mr. Xu asked those present to express their opinions as much as possible. At that time, the speakers from the banking and money industries included Qin Runqing, Li Renzai, Xu Guomao, Wang Yansong, and Cheng Junguan, who all made frank statements about the pain suffered by the banking and money industries and their hopes for the Ministry of Finance. Summarizing the various opinions, they were nothing more than the following points: (1) Please ask the government to investigate the responsibility for the gold rush and whether the speculators are mostly merchants or non-merchants. If there are speculators in the banking and money industries, which group and which family they belong to, please ask the government to investigate and announce. (2) In the past, the Joint Reserve Board and the Central Bank had a contract allowing for an overdraft of 5 billion yuan. After the gold rush occurred this time, the central government ordered a stop to the overdraft. This overdraft method was approved by the Ministry of Finance, and this sum of money is of a standby nature, guaranteeing that it will not be fully used. The amount of 5 billion is not large and does not affect the government's policies, but it is a major guarantee for each bank and firm. It is hoped that the government will allow the restoration of the overdraft. (3) It is hoped that this inspection will be of a positive nature. Apart from those related to the gold rush, do not be too trivial and harsh. Otherwise, it may drive floating capital out of the financial sector, which is even more harmful. At present, our country's production has entered a state of paralysis. It is hoped that the authorities will have an accurate estimate of the needs of the national production sector in order to provide appropriate assistance. Today's important plan is to seize materials and promote production. It seems appropriate to convene a meeting of the Shanghai production sector to determine the amount and prescribe the right medicine. The Central Bank's current practice of purchasing gold at low prices is not very appropriate. It is best to open up a legitimate outlet for gold, that is, to allow the exchange of gold for foreign exchange under superior conditions to purchase the necessary production tools. (4) At present, bank deposits are too small and are not proportional to the amount of floating capital. Therefore, the financial sector has no power to control market interest rates. It is hoped that the government can reduce the income tax on deposit interest to facilitate banks' absorption of deposits. At the same time, it is hoped that promissory notes do not require deposit preparation. (5) It is hoped that the listed interest rate can be increased. Because current prices are rising and the expenses of banks and firms are huge, there is no way to pay the expenses without raising the interest rate. In fact, the market interest rate has already exceeded the listed rate. (6) In the past, the regulations stipulated that only the court and the Ministry of Finance could check the books of banks and firms. Under the current emergency measures, can other agencies check them? Please answer clearly. (7) There is a rumor that if gold is found in the inspection of the vault, it can be confiscated. Please, Vice Minister, dispel the rumors on the spot. (8) In the new method of controlling finance, it is hoped that there will be a clear stipulation on the use of loans so that each bank and firm can follow it. (9) At present, there is a phenomenon of disconnection between the Central Bank and commercial banks. The Central Bank is only a "government bank, not a bank of banks." It has failed to do its best to regulate finance. When the money supply is loose and the price of gold rises, it does not sell gold and materials. On the contrary, it sells a large amount of cotton yarn when the money supply is tight today, which is really incomprehensible. (10) It is hoped that real estate can be used as collateral for loans in the future to open up an outlet for capital.

Hope to Establish Mutual Trust with the Government

The above opinions were answered separately by Mr. Xu and Mr. Dai. Dai Mingli stated on the spot that the Ministry of Finance has negotiated with relevant parties and that the Ministry of Finance will still be responsible for the inspection of banks and firms in the future. Xu Boyuan stated that the overdraft of 5 billion can still be handled according to the contract if there are no special circumstances. The inspection of the vault will be handled in accordance with the government's regulations, and there is no confiscation of gold upon discovery. Banks must have detailed records of loans to production businesses. This is a must for general banks. As for the current inspection, it naturally belongs to a positive nature. However, because this incident originated from the financial sector, the inspection also focuses on banks and firms. In the future, there will be positive measures in the economy. The Ministry of Finance will always assist legitimate commercial banks and has no intention of making things difficult. Assisting production is an important task in the financial sector in the future. It is regrettable that some of the production loans last year were indeed used to purchase gold. They will be dealt with severely after investigation in the future, and the banks and firms that handled them should also bear moral responsibility. It is hoped that the financial sector in Shanghai can establish mutual trust with the government in the future and cooperate with each other in action.

### Payment of Value Increase for Pre-War Deposits

The Ministry of Finance is Still Studying

[Our Own Report] According to Vice Minister of Finance Xu Boyuan: The Ministry of Finance is still studying the multiplier for the payment of the value increase for pre-war deposits, and a solution may be available soon. In the future, the determination of the multiplier will take into account the interests of both depositors and banks, and strive for fairness and rationality.

### Three-Person Committee to Investigate Bank and Firm Accounts

[Our Own Report] Vice Minister of Finance Xu Boyuan convened a meeting of members of the Economic Supervision Group and the persons in charge of each group at Commander Xuan's private residence the night before last to discuss cooperation methods and report on the mission assigned to them in Shanghai this time, which is to thoroughly investigate the details of the gold rush and pay special attention to illegal acceptance of gold mortgages and short-selling and speculative purchases by banks and firms. Those found to have factual evidence will be severely punished according to law. In order to accomplish the mission, it is hoped that the garrison department will cooperate and proceed together. A three-person committee was immediately decided to be established, consisting of Dai Mingli, Director of the Currency Department of the Ministry of Finance, Chief Gao of the Joint Administration Office, and Xu Youzuo, Head of the Gold and Currency Group of the Economic Supervision Group, to direct the existing staff of the Gold and Currency Group and the officials assigned to Shanghai by the Ministry of Finance to be divided into seven units to continue checking the accounts of banks and firms throughout the city.

[Another Dispatch] The Economic Supervision Group continued its investigation and surveillance work yesterday, and the market situation improved. The Food Group also sent armed personnel to the suburbs of Caohejing, Zhoujiaqiao, Yangshupu, Nanshi, and Jiangwan to crack down on black market transactions. The market price of yarn and cloth also continued to fall sharply yesterday. The Gold and Currency Group's investigation of bank and firm accounts has yielded clues and may take action within days.

### Finance Minister Yu Hongjun Comes to Shanghai for Inspection: Wang Yunwu and Xiao Zheng Return to Beijing

Finance Minister Yu Hongjun came to Shanghai yesterday morning to listen to reports and make important decisions in order to inspect the financial dynamics in Shanghai. The main points are: (1) Instructing various banks and firms to enhance their business. (2) The business scope of the banks of various provinces and cities stationed in Shanghai should be within the approval of the Ministry of Finance. If there is any excess, they should stop business immediately. Mr. Yu also visited President Song at about 10:00 AM yesterday morning to discuss matters. He returned to Beijing that night. In addition, Minister of Economic Affairs Wang Yunwu and Finance Minister Xiao Zheng have returned to Beijing by car last night.

### Four More People Arrested for Buying and Selling U.S. Dollars

[Our Own Report] The Fourth Investigation Brigade of the Garrison Department arrested a suspect, Chen Zongqie, yesterday at the intersection of Sichuan Road and Jiujiang Road for illegally selling U.S. dollars. In addition, the police station arrested three suspects, Sun Zhengfu, Yang Qichao, and Shan Xionghua, in the North Sichuan Road area for illegally selling gold and U.S. dollars.

### Detailed Rules for Commodity Supply: Divided into Three Major Departments; Must Be Submitted to Chairman for Approval Before Implementation

[Our Own Report] After Xu Kan, Chief Accountant of the National Government's Directorate-General of Budget, gathered the persons in charge of various relevant agencies on the 17th to draft the detailed rules for the implementation of the method of supplying daily necessities, Mr. Xu, together with the persons in charge of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance, and Ministry of Food, carried them to President Song for approval on the morning of the 18th. President Song stated that he would wait to submit them to Chairman Chiang for approval before announcing and implementing them. It is reported that the content of the implementation details is roughly divided into three major departments. The first is the distribution of supplies for public school teachers, the second is the distribution of supplies for industrial workers, and the third is the detailed rules for stabilizing prices. During implementation, the agencies requesting distribution will first compile a roster and submit it to the Executive Yuan for approval, and then issue purchase certificates. At the same time, the Materials Supply Bureau of the Executive Yuan will issue materials supply vouchers. The agencies supplying the materials will then concentrate the materials in various municipal governments. Public school teachers can purchase from the municipal government with purchase certificates and supply vouchers. The amount of supplies distributed will generally be based on four family members per public school teacher, and the amount distributed to staff members will be slightly more than that of workers.

### Wu Kaixian Talks: Announcing Emergency Measures; No Different from Economic Martial Law; Implementing a Rationing System to Stabilize Prices; Hope Everyone Can Endure and Overcome This Difficult Time

[Our Own Report] Director of the Social Affairs Bureau Wu Kaixian has resumed his duties after taking leave. He told reporters yesterday: The economic emergency measures announced by the government this time are equivalent to declaring economic martial law. It is believed that the turmoil caused by the gold rush will gradually stabilize in the short term. After the turmoil passes and martial law is lifted, these emergency measures can be stopped. In the past, workers and merchants? mutually shirked responsibility. Workers claimed that wages increased due to high prices, and merchants claimed that prices were driven up due to increased wages affecting costs. This is the same as arguing which came first, the chicken or the egg. In fact, they are mutually causal. This time, the government will first stabilize wages, ordering that they should not exceed the cost of living index in January, and will try its best to reduce prices in the short term, so as to fully deal with the issue of negotiated prices and make the responsibilities clear. If the price of goods is still high, it will be clearly the responsibility of the merchants. This is an urgent remedy for the country's economic crisis. It is hoped that everyone can be patient, believing that this time will not be too long and will be able to stabilize in the short term.

Supply of Daily Necessities to Be Implemented from March

Regarding the rationing plan proposed by myself, the plan for cultural workers and private school teachers has been deleted, but the rest have been adopted by the central government as proposed. This method will be implemented first in Beijing and Shanghai, and then gradually promoted in other regions. The public school teachers' part in this city will be handled by a committee established by the municipal government, and the supply of daily necessities for workers will be handled by the Social Affairs Bureau assisting relevant agencies. The supply of these daily necessities cannot be procured for this month, so it will be implemented from March. Before implementation, it has been agreed with President Song to calculate this month's wages by converting the price difference between February and January into legal tender and issuing it. It has also been agreed with President Song that the fixed method may be rigid, and local customs and habits may be different, so it can be adapted to local conditions and individual circumstances and handled flexibly.

Director Wu also said: After this method is implemented, if the factory is still losing money, the government will not allow it to close down, so it should be audited and provided with relief if necessary.

People Buying Gold Jewelry Does Not Encourage Speculation

Wu believes that it is inappropriate to include jewelry in the measures to crack down on gold trading. He believes that people use their small monthly surplus to buy gold jewelry, which is a good form of disguised savings and invisibly helps the government to promote the policy of contracting currency. Otherwise, using it to buy goods will stimulate prices. Some people believe that last year's year-end bonuses for workers were mostly used to purchase gold jewelry, which is also one of the reasons for encouraging speculation. This is a blind statement. Those who encourage speculation are not small citizens who buy gold rings, but those who buy gold bars. Therefore, jewelry should be opened up. Otherwise, the outlet for gold will either be smuggling or waste. Therefore, he has discussed it with the Minister of Economic Affairs to formulate remedial measures as soon as possible.

### Commemoration of the New Life Movement: Grand Event Today

### Industries Unanimously Express Willingness to Assist Government Policy Decisions: Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Holds Price Conference Yesterday

[Reported by our newspaper] The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce convened a price conference yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM. Approximately 400 people attended, including Director Xiao Zheng of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, Mayor Wu, Speaker Pan, and directors and executive directors of various trade associations. After Chairman Xu Jiqing reported the purpose of the meeting, Director Xiao was invited to speak. He stated that the recent passage of the Economic Emergency Measures Plan by the National Defense Supreme Council was intended to save the current economic crisis. The government's passage of this plan aims to eliminate speculative markets, assist legitimate industry and commerce, and promote foreign trade to stabilize the overall economic situation. However, while increasing exchange rates to develop international trade, it is also necessary to consider the rising domestic prices and the difficulties of the people's livelihood. Therefore, effective methods must be adopted to suppress prices and bring them into a normal supply and demand relationship, rather than being swayed by fluctuations in foreign currency. This requires 80% of the effort from everyone present, in addition to the government's efforts. The government is well aware of the difficulties faced by industry and commerce, and is making every effort to stabilize wages. The cycle of wages and prices chasing each other will bring legitimate industries to the brink of bankruptcy. Therefore, it has been decided to fix wages and adopt a system of in-kind distribution. It is hoped that all industries and commerce will work together with the government to achieve this goal.

Hope Industries Will Not Seek Petty Gains

Mayor Wu then spoke, stating four points: (1) After the ban on buying and selling gold banknotes, a black market may emerge. While the government is responsible for suppressing and punishing this, it is hoped that industry and commerce will not follow the gold banknote black market and raise prices. (2) To provide legitimate outlets for idle capital, the government has decided to auction off enemy and puppet materials, surplus materials, and state-owned production enterprises, or issue stocks. However, it is hoped that this will not lead to hoarding and speculation. It is hoped that trade associations will not only prohibit hoarding within their own industries, but also report hoarding by non-members. (3) Prices rose sharply with the rise in gold banknotes, but since the price of gold banknotes is now regulated, all prices should automatically decrease. (4) Price fluctuations in Shanghai often affect the entire country. It is hoped that industries will not seek temporary petty gains and throw the national economy into chaos.

Freezing Gold Ornaments Is Highly Inappropriate

Speaker Pan then spoke, outlining five main points: (1) It is hoped that various export goods, such as silk, tea, tung oil, and pig bristles, will not rise again and again due to the exchange rate change. Such unreasonable price increases are tantamount to suicide. (2) The government's recently passed Economic Emergency Measures Plan has been sarcastically called a "rehash of the extraordinary period." It must be understood that China is still in an extraordinary period, and the government's emergency measures are to save itself and relieve the people. (3) Whether the emergency measures are effective depends on the integrity of personnel. If personnel are not sound, the best measures can become the most dangerous. (4) The ban on the sale of gold ornaments, which has led to the closure of silver shops, is absolutely inappropriate. This measure will freeze the people's gold ornaments, depriving thrifty and accumulating civilians of part of their assets. This is tantamount to the government selling goods to the people and then declaring them invalid. (5) Regarding the arrest of individuals privately selling US dollars the other day, it should be verified whether they were openly trading. If they were arrested simply for carrying US dollars, then anyone could be arrested at any time.

Industry Representatives Express Several Hopes

After Pan's speech, Mayor Wu explained the ban on the sale of gold ornaments and the arrest of individuals privately selling US dollars. Representatives from various trade associations then expressed their opinions, unanimously stating their willingness to assist the government's policies. However, they hoped that the government would adopt the opinions of various industries and implement practical and effective measures for stabilizing wages, in-kind distribution, and supplying raw materials at reasonable prices. They also hoped that the government would handle the suppression of usury and the provision of production loans fairly. The discussion continued until 6:00 PM, when the meeting was adjourned.

### Tragedy on Dongda Ming Road: Kerosene Stove Explosion Causes Disaster; Eleven Women and Children Dead or Injured; Kerosene Mixed with Gasoline Can Be Reported and Investigated in the Future

[Reported by our newspaper] A fire broke out at 4:20 AM yesterday at No. 77, Fuqing Lane, No. 1027 Dongda Ming Road (East Broadway Road) in Hongkou. Eight people were buried in the fire, and three were injured after jumping from windows. Because the residents were still in deep sleep at the time, the fire had become uncontrollable by the time the police on duty discovered it. The fire department received the news and drove several pumper trucks to the scene to put out the fire. It took about two hours to extinguish the fire. In addition to burning down the house at that address, it also spread to the building at No. 79 next door. The lane is inhabited by poor families, most of whom have mezzanine floors, with many people sleeping in small rooms. It is reported that the fire started on the lower floor, immediately burning through the ladder, causing the tragedy. After the incident, it was learned that Mrs. Chen Lu, an old woman on the upper floor of No. 79, fell and was injured after jumping from the window. Cai Renbao injured his foot, and Xu Xiang was injured in the face. They were sent to the Lester Chinese Hospital. The bodies found by firefighters at the scene were burned beyond recognition and were a terrible sight. They were identified as Yu Yinmei (21 years old), Mrs. Wang Zhou (21 years old), girl Wang Meili (3 years old), boy Cai Bilian (4 years old), Mrs. Cai Li (23 years old), Chen Dongmei, Cai Xiaomei (newborn 29 days old), and a certain Jia, younger brother of Cai Li (newly arrived in Shanghai from the countryside), a total of eight people.

[Another report] Prosecutor Quan Tao of the District Procuratorate went to the fire scene yesterday morning to examine the bodies. The arsonist has fled in fear of punishment. According to nearby residents, the fire was caused by a kerosene stove, because the kerosene was mixed with gasoline, causing an explosion. Prosecutor Quan paid close attention to this point and stated that if citizens find that kerosene is mixed with gasoline in the future, they can directly report it to the District Procuratorate for investigation.

### Trial of Rickshaw Puller Stabbed with Knife Reopened: Victim's Injuries Not Yet Healed; Defendant Not Allowed Bail; Three Witnesses Interrogated, Trial Adjourned

[Reported by our newspaper] The case of the US sailor stabbing a rickshaw puller was retried yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM in the Fourth Criminal Court of the District Court. The victim, Cheng Rongfang, whose injuries had not yet healed, appeared in court with his brother Cheng Rongquan and a lawyer. According to Cheng's statement to the court, his brother's injuries had not fully recovered, and he had specifically asked him to withdraw the previous statement of withdrawal of charges that he had signed after being deceived. Judge Wu Shaochang first summoned witness Zhu Songhua. According to Zhu, he is a rickshaw puller who was waiting for business at the entrance of the Dongda Ming Road Seaside Bar on January 1 this year. He witnessed Rogers committing the crime and saw Cheng Rongfang initially supporting himself on a utility pole after being injured before falling to the ground. Another witness, Lewis, stated that he is an American and an employee of the General Fishery Management Office. He also went to the Seaside Bar that day. At about 10:00 PM, he went out with Rogers and waitress Wang Xiulan. As soon as they went out, many rickshaw pullers came forward to pester them. To avoid conflict, they retreated into the bar and rested for a quarter of an hour before going out again. The second time they went out, there were fewer people. He and Rogers walked towards the General Fishery Management Office stop on Zhaofeng Road. The rickshaw pullers surrounded them again. At that time, he and Rogers were six or nine feet apart, so he did not personally see how Rogers fought with the rickshaw puller, and he did not know the reason for the fight. Another witness, Paul Scott, stated that he is an instructor at the Fishery Management Office. He and Rogers went out together on New Year's Day. The second time they left the Seaside Bar, the rickshaw pullers first threw stones at them and then surrounded Rogers. Later, when Rogers broke out of the encirclement and came to the station, he saw that his forehead was injured. As for how Cheng Rongfang was injured, he said, "I did not see it."

After questioning the witnesses, the court interrogated the murderer Rogers again. According to his statement, the first time he went out, he was surrounded by many rickshaw pullers. One of them pestered the waitress who was traveling with him. The second time he went out, one of the people closest to him threw a two-foot-long rope tied with an iron ring at his head, causing him injury. To protect himself, he drew his knife as a warning, injuring Cheng Rongfang. As for whether he owed Cheng money for the rickshaw, Rogers claimed that he never thought of taking a rickshaw to return to Fuxing Island. Dongda Ming Road is about four miles from the Fuxing Island fishing boat mooring site. The Fishery Management Office has its own transportation vehicles, so he never took Cheng Rongfang's rickshaw at all. The court heard the defense lawyers Yao Yongli and Jidexun requesting the court to question Rogers on several points for reference. The court instructed that if there were any proposals, they could be submitted in writing for a ruling. They also requested permission to post bail, stating that both lawyers were willing to take full responsibility and would never allow the defendant to escape. They also said that in order to maintain Sino-American relations, they requested that he not be detained for too long, but this was rejected. Later, the plaintiff's lawyer submitted a supplementary statement, stating that the victim had been coerced into signing and requested that the previous statement be withdrawn and that legal aid be granted. After receiving the statement, the court adjourned the case for retrial and returned the defendant to custody.

According to Huang, he first saw two women running up the three floors when he went upstairs, and he was suddenly assassinated by two gunmen rushing from behind when Huang stepped on the stairs on the fourth floor.

As for the reason why Huang was assassinated, according to Huang himself, villains planned to seize his property and thus took this vicious act.

### To Protect Workers' Future Livelihood, the General Labor Union Puts Forward Four Suggestions

[Reported by our newspaper] The "Economic Emergency Measures Plan" revised and passed by the National Defense Commission stipulates that "the wages of employees calculated according to living expenses should take the living expenses of January this year as the highest index, and the basic salary must not be increased in any way." The person in charge of the Municipal General Labor Union told reporters that if the suppression of prices is not successful, this provision will make the lives of workers even more difficult. Therefore, the General Labor Union put forward the following four suggestions: (1) The items to be rationed in the plan announced by the Central Government only include food, cloth, and fuel. At least three more items should be added: cooking oil, table salt, and sugar. (2) The rationed quantity should be sufficient for the needs of ordinary households, and the quality should be noted and should meet normal standards. (3) The items to be rationed according to the regulations of the Central Government are only limited to industrial workers; professional workers should also be rationed the same way. (4) The rationing should be jointly handled with various labor unions or cooperative societies run by the labor unions. It is reported that the General Labor Union will submit the above four suggestions to the Social Affairs Bureau today for submission to the municipal government.

### National Taiwan University Welcomes Professors from the Mainland to Conduct Intensive Research

[Central News Agency, Taipei, 18th] National Taiwan University is currently the best research environment in the country. Within the university's budget, NT$3 million per month is allocated for professors' research expenses.

### Change of President at Guiyang Teachers College; Students Express Rejection

[Report from our newspaper, Guiyang Airmail] The issue of the change of president at the National Guiyang Teachers College has been ongoing for nearly two months without resolution. Since the Director of the Guizhou Department of Education, Chuan Qixue, returned to Guiyang from the capital at the end of last month, the new president of the college, Du Shuji, decided to go abroad to study education, stating that he would take over the position after returning to the country and that he would request the Ministry of Education to send someone to act as an agent for the college's affairs. The students of the college telegraphed the Ministry of Education requesting that they quickly dispatch a formal president who has the knowledge, morality, character, prestige, and ability to lead young people to head the college. Subsequently, the Ministry of Education suddenly appointed Zeng Jing, a professor in the Department of Education at the college, to act as Du's agent and take over the college's affairs. Upon hearing the news, the students of the college unanimously expressed their rejection and sent representatives to visit Zeng, who also expressed extreme surprise, saying that he had no prior knowledge of this and would never consider it. He was willing to resign voluntarily to the Ministry of Education and made several statements regarding the reasons for his resignation: (1) He had no interest in educational administration; (2) He did not know Du personally, and he was a colleague of President Qi for many years; (3) Not only would he not act as the president's agent, but he would also not be willing to be the formal president even if appointed. The students were satisfied and unanimously resolved the following: In addition to telegraphing the Ministry of Education again to request the speedy dispatch of a formal president, they asked Professor Zeng Jing to fulfill his promise, resign voluntarily to the Ministry of Education, issue a statement in the newspaper, and solemnly declare to Director Fu that he should not cling to his prejudices, openly support Zeng, and secretly assist Du, causing further disturbances.

### Self-Funded Students Petitioned Yesterday, Requesting a Foreign Exchange Rate of 3350 from the Central Bank; President Bei Gladly Agreed to Meet and Respond This Morning

[Report from our newspaper] Over 1,200 self-funded students who passed the Ministry of Education's examination last July are unable to go abroad due to the recent adjustment of the foreign exchange rate to 12,000 yuan. At 10:00 AM yesterday, over 60 self-funded students, including Zhao Yiwei and Ling Shuang, gathered at the Bund Park and went to the Central Bank to petition President Bei Zuyi, submitting a written petition explaining their reasons and requesting a foreign exchange rate of 3350, with a one-time exchange of US$2,900 (including one year of tuition of US$400, one year of living expenses of US$1,800, and travel expenses of US$700). Bei sent his secretary, Zhu Kunshou, to meet with them, stating that the Central Bank was an implementing agency and could not accept their request. The student representatives informed him that they had previously petitioned the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Finance, and the Executive Yuan last winter, and both the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Finance had replied that the matter should be decided by the Central Bank, so they came specifically to visit President Bei and presented the Ministry of Education's instructions. Secretary Zhu then reported back to Bei and instructed the students to wait outside. They waited until after 11:00 AM but still did not see Bei appear, and the students became quite anxious and began to question him. Zhao Yiwei and Ling Ji entered the office and contacted Secretary Zhu, requesting that he quickly speak with Bei by telephone. The students then sent people out to buy dry food for lunch to show their intention of not leaving the Central Bank until they saw President Bei. Seeing this, the Central Bank staff invited Lin Weiying, Director of the Foreign Exchange Examination Department, to come forward and agree with President Bei on the phone: President Bei would personally meet with student representatives at 10:00 AM this morning (the 19th) to give a responsible and affirmative response. Lin also assured the students that he would be responsible for simplifying the procedures for self-funded students applying for foreign exchange as much as possible. After 12:00 PM, the students left. At that time, the students stated that over a hundred students would go to the Central Bank again this morning at 10:00 AM to meet with President Bei in person and await a responsible response. It is reported that Bei needs to submit the issue of the students' request for a foreign exchange rate of 3350 to President Song for a decision.

### The Contents of the National Standard Geography Textbook for Senior Elementary Schools Should Be Corrected; the Ministry of Education Orders the Municipal Education Bureau to Instruct All Elementary Schools to Take Note

[Report from our newspaper] The Ministry of Education recently issued an order to the Municipal Education Bureau stating: "The current national standard textbooks for elementary schools were compiled and published successively during the Anti-Japanese War years. Elementary schools in various provinces and cities have been using them for many years. Since the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, domestic and international situations have changed, and the occupied territories have been recovered. Administrative regions have also been adjusted in many places. The curriculum and teaching materials of elementary schools should be re-revised separately to meet the actual situation and adapt to the needs. Regarding the elementary school curriculum standards, the Ministry has already drafted a revised draft, which will be promulgated and implemented after detailed review and completion. Regarding the national standard textbooks for elementary schools, the Ministry is supervising the National Compilation and Translation Bureau to revise them as soon as possible and carefully to achieve perfection. Except for the eight volumes of the elementary Chinese language and common knowledge textbooks that have been revised and re-printed, and all schools should uniformly use the revised standard editions, there are many contents in the geography textbook for senior elementary schools that should be revised. A correction table has been formulated, and each school should correct the text and illustrations in the textbook separately during teaching. For other textbooks, if the content differs from the current actual situation before the revised standard editions are published and supplied, corrections should also be made separately during teaching. In addition to issuing separate instructions, the Ministry is urgently sending the national standard geography textbook for senior elementary schools and instructing all affiliated elementary schools to take note of it."

### A Tour of Sichuan University, the Highest Institution of Learning in Southwest China

By our correspondent in Chengdu, Zhou Xueduan

Leaving the eastern suburbs of Chengdu and heading west along the Jin River, which flows "ten thousand miles with shimmering water," for about three miles, one arrives at the famous Wangjiang Tower, a historical site of Xue Tao. To the south of the Jin River Tower, a vast expanse of land is dotted with several magnificent palace-style buildings amidst red flowers and green trees. This is the National Sichuan University, the highest institution of learning in Southwest China.

Sichuan University—commonly referred to as Chuan Da—is considered the highest institution of learning in the Southwest and the most complete school of its kind. It not only encompasses five colleges (liberal arts, law, agriculture, science and engineering, and teacher's college) and twenty-three departments, but also has graduate schools (liberal arts, science, and economics), affiliated middle and elementary schools, night schools, and preparatory classes, a so-called "five generations under one roof," having everything one could need. Second, Chuan Da has a long history of fifty years, from the merging of the former Shixue Hall and other institutions to the present. Its development is a history of modern education in Sichuan, and the graduates of Chuan Da over these fifty years are widely distributed throughout Sichuan, serving as the driving force behind the advancement of Sichuan's governance, society, culture, and various construction projects over the decades. Therefore, Chuan Da is inextricably linked to Sichuan. Due to these two characteristics, Chuan Da can represent Sichuan education. Thus, I will provide a general introduction to Chuan Da.

History of Chuan Da

Chuan Da was formed by the merger of the former Public Sichuan University, Chengdu University, and Chengdu Normal University. The history of Public Sichuan University is the earliest, dating back to the late Qing Dynasty reforms. There were the "Shixue Hall" and the "Cunguxue Hall." In the 31st year of Guangxu, they were merged into the Sichuan School of Law and Politics. In the Republic of China, it was renamed the University of Law and Politics. In the 16th year of the Republic of China, the Law and Politics, Foreign Languages, and Chinese Studies specialized schools were merged into Public Sichuan University. Chengdu University and Normal University were originally the Sichuan Advanced Normal School during the Qing Dynasty. In the first year of the Republic of China, it was renamed the Sichuan Higher Normal School. In the third year of the Republic of China, it was renamed the National Higher Normal School. In the 15th year, they were reorganized into Chengdu University and Normal University, respectively. In the 17th year, the University Council ordered the Sichuan Department of Education to merge all universities and specialized schools in Sichuan Province into the National Sichuan University. In the 20th year, the merger of the three universities was successful, resulting in today's Chuan Da. In the fifteen years after the merger, the presidents were Wang Zhaorong, Ren Hongjun, and Cheng Tianfang. The current president is Huang Jilu.

Current Overview

Chuan Da is currently the university with the most colleges and departments and the most complete scale in the country. The total number of students is over 5,000. The organization is divided into five systems: graduate school, university, night school and preparatory class, affiliated middle school, and elementary school. The contents are as follows:

(1) Graduate School: There is the Graduate School of Liberal Arts, divided into four groups: language and literature, writing, history, and classics, headed by Xiang Chu. The Graduate School of Science currently has a Department of Chemistry, divided into five groups: organic, inorganic, theoretical, applied chemistry, and pharmacy, headed by Tang Xiufu. The Graduate School of Economics is a part of the Xifu Social Science Research Institute, headed by Peng Dixian, specializing in research on the economic resources, transportation, and prices of Southwest China.

(2) University: There are currently five colleges and twenty-three departments. The College of Law includes the Departments of Political Science, Economics, and Law, headed by Wu Yongquan. The College of Liberal Arts includes the Departments of Chinese, Diplomacy, and History and Geography, headed by Xiang Xianqiao. The College of Agriculture includes the Departments of Agronomy, Agricultural Economics, Forestry, Agricultural Chemistry, Sericulture, Horticulture, and Plant Pathology and Entomology, as well as an affiliated farm, headed by Peng Jiayuan. The College of Science and Engineering includes the Departments of Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Civil Engineering, Electrical Engineering, and Aeronautical Engineering, as well as a chemical testing program and a practice factory, headed by Zheng Zhanhan. The Teachers College includes the Department of Education and a training department, headed by Deng Zhichun.

(3) Night School and Preparatory Class: The night school is specially set up by Chuan Da to help out-of-school civil servants and professional youth. After five years of study, they can still obtain a bachelor's degree. Currently, there are three groups: Chinese, Law, and Commerce, as well as a journalism program. The preparatory class aims to help middle school graduates who have not been able to enter university. Currently, there are over 2,000 students receiving university preparatory education.

(4) Affiliated Middle School and Elementary School: The affiliated middle school and elementary school of Chuan Da have been established for over 30 years and are schools with a good reputation in Chengdu. The current administrative system is directly under the Teachers College and is also an experimental school for the students of the college to practice and serve.

Future Prospects

Although Chuan Da is the highest institution of learning in the Southwest with a long history, for decades, due to the instability of the country and the constant turmoil in Sichuan, Chuan Da has been operating miserably and establishing its scale amidst difficulties and hardships. From the Shixue Hall of the late Qing Dynasty to the great merger in the 23rd year of the Republic of China, this period was a time of turbidity in Sichuan and also the dawn of new education in Sichuan. Chuan Da was brewing and sprouting during this period. From the establishment of the new Chuan Da to the present fifteen years, the situation in Sichuan has gradually improved, and education has flourished. Chuan Da has also grown and prospered. Chuan Da's development is closely related to the political situation in Sichuan and the progress of education. Therefore, in my visit to Chuan Da, from the president and professors to the students, everyone regards building a new Sichuan as the responsibility and obligation of Chuan Da. This is the current educational core idea of Chuan Da and also the educational policy for Chuan Da's future development.

President Huang Jilu, an old educator in the country, believes that "Chuan Da's past hard work" was arduous. Today, it has gone through a difficult journey of pioneering and brought better conditions to Chuan Da. In the future, the country's construction will involve many aspects, and the need for construction talent will be most urgent. Chuan Da enjoys superior development conditions and should take on this task as soon as possible. Chuan Da is the highest institution of learning in Sichuan Province, and Sichuan is a national construction experiment area. Cultivating senior construction talent for building a new Sichuan is Huang's ambitious plan for Chuan Da's future development. The development policy is determined by seeking balanced development in quality and quantity and expanding the number of departments, with the expectation that Chuan Da will become the university with the most departments and the best quality in the country in the shortest possible time.

Before the war, Chuan Da's campus was located at the former site of Liu Bei's Shu Han palace in Chengdu's Royal City. During the war, it was once moved to Mount Emei, one of the four famous mountains in the country. The current campus is located on the banks of the Jin River. Recently completed buildings include the library, the science and mathematics building, the chemistry building, and the Wenbin Building. The beams and pillars are splendidly decorated, and the architecture is magnificent. The Jin River surrounds the buildings, and sails come and go. Sand gulls fly in the sky. Students recite and sing in the majestic buildings, recalling the dilapidated ruins of the former Royal City and the simple and crude conditions of Mount Emei. This symbolizes the future created by Chuan Da's hard work and construction, and the future is bright.

### Extremely Tense Situation: Chun Mao Suffers Minor Defeat to Ren Yu, Green Forest Beats Hua Yang; Women’s Qing Zi Upsets Strong Hua

[Our Dispatch] The basketball league continued with three games last night at the Municipal Gymnasium. The highly anticipated match saw the dark horse Chun Mao, fresh from defeating Hua Lian, facing off against Ren Yu. Both teams displayed clear and skillful play. Chun Mao's Liu Fushan excelled in shooting, passing, and stealing, but his solo efforts proved insufficient. Despite repeatedly narrowing the gap to a single point, they ultimately fell short. Ren Yu, with its diverse talent and a mix of long-range and close-range shots, secured a 40-34 victory over Chun Mao. The first game of the night was a women's match between Cao Jia Ban and Women's Qing Zi. The absence of Cao Jia Ban's key player, Huang Jun, due to illness significantly weakened their morale. Women's Qing Zi, with Zhu Jin, Qian Chuping, and Jian Zhiguang displaying exceptional energy, managed to overcome Cao Jia Ban's single standout, Manli. Ultimately, they prevailed with a 27-21 upset victory over Strong Hua. In the middle game of the Class A Division, the young Green Forest team faced the hefty Hua Yang team. Despite the heavier Hua Yang taking an early lead with excellent jump shots, their slow movements became a liability. Green Forest adopted a quick offense, causing Hua Yang to panic and tire. Consequently, Green Forest won 37-34. Details of each game are as follows:

Women's

The first game was a women's match between Strong Hua and Women's Qing Zi, with Yu Ju as the referee. Strong Hua's Cao Manli scored the first point with a free throw, which was quickly answered by Women's Qing Zi's Qian Chuping with a long-range shot. Manqi and Manli then scored in succession, giving Strong Hua a 4-2 lead. However, the young and agile forwards of Women's Qing Zi helped them take a 7-4 lead in the first quarter. Cao Jia Ban's Manli remained composed, and Strong Hua managed to regain the lead 13-11 by halftime. After switching sides, Women's Qing Zi maintained their momentum, with Zhu Jinyun scoring the first basket to tie the game at 13. The third quarter ended with a 19-19 tie. In the final quarter, both teams played with extreme intensity, aware of the stakes. Women's Qing Zi's Qian Chuping made a free throw and seized opportunities under the basket, scoring two more points, leading 24-19. Cao Jia Ban's morale faltered, and although Manli scored some points, Women's Qing Zi effectively stalled, running down the clock to win 27-21, defeating Strong Hua.

After a 6-6 tie, Hua Yang's Ji Youkun made a long shot, and Dong Zhongyi followed up, establishing a commanding 17-9 lead. Green Forest's Zheng Miao scored from the baseline, gradually finding his rhythm and narrowing the gap to 20-22, just one basket behind. When Hua Yang's Zhao Ting fouled out and Sun Mingxin entered the game, Hua Yang led 22-20 at halftime.

After switching sides, Hua Yang's Song Qihou scored, followed by Zheng Miao. Yun Shan then scored, bringing the score to 24-23, just one point behind. Zheng Miao scored again, giving Green Forest a 25-24 lead. Green Forest's Yun Shan and Jia Yi scored frequently, while Hua Yang showed signs of fatigue.

Ren Yu's Sun Guozheng scored from the sideline, and Shen Pengju added a layup, followed by Wang Huaiting, giving Ren Yu a 6-5 lead. Pengju and Xin Yun played exceptionally well, and although Chun Mao's Li Xianzheng and He Hanfu also contributed, Ren Yu led 18-16 at halftime. After switching sides, Ren Yu's scoring increased, and Chun Mao fell behind. They made frequent substitutions, but could not overcome Ren Yu's offense, making it 32-27. Ren Yu's Sun Guozheng fouled out and was replaced by Yao Wenyi. Chun Mao still struggled to recover. As time ran out, Ren Yu defeated Chun Mao 40-34.

### National Sports Association Launches Fundraising Campaign; Dong Shouyi to Visit Shanghai Tomorrow for Discussions

[Our Dispatch, Nanjing, 18th] The General Association of the China National Sports Advancement Association, originally located in Shanghai, suffered complete destruction of its facilities during the war. Its leased building was also reclaimed by the landlord. Therefore, after the victory and return to normalcy, the association has decided to establish its headquarters in Nanjing. To support its post-war efforts, the standing committee of the association resolved to form a Fundraising Committee to solicit donations to advance its work. This fundraising committee recently held a meeting in Shanghai, setting a minimum fundraising goal of 500 million yuan. The association's past sources of funding included: (1) central government subsidies, (2) allocations from provincial and municipal governments, (3) donations from individuals enthusiastic about sports, and (4) ticket revenue. Currently, there is no ticket revenue, so the fundraising efforts will focus on the first three sources. Dong Shouyi, the association's director-general, has concluded his participation in meetings and planning in Shanghai and arrived in Nanjing on the 17th. He is currently negotiating matters related to the headquarters building, preparing fundraising materials, and is scheduled to visit Shanghai on the 20th for further discussions.

### Railway Small Ball Tournament: Materials Wins Over Business

The Railway Department's Small Ball Tournament saw a match between the Business and Materials departments yesterday afternoon at 1:00 PM at the Railway Bureau's field. The crowd was quite large, but the damp field affected the players' running. Despite the presence of renowned players like Han Longhai, Gao Baozheng, and Jin Shigui on the Business team, the Materials department's more balanced team prevailed with a score of 3-2.

Fifteen minutes into the game, Business's Wang Changsheng received support from the midfield and scored, taking the lead. Materials was not to be outdone, as Li Houren passed to the right wing, and Yun Chanxing scored, tying the game 1-1 at halftime.

After switching sides, Materials' Li Houren made a solo run and scored, giving Materials a 2-1 lead. Soon after, Han Longhai launched an attack from the wing, and Gao Baozheng broke through, causing goalkeeper Wang Jie to lose his guard, tying the game 2-2 again. Five minutes before the end of the game, Materials took a shot from 20 yards away, scoring and giving Materials a 3-2 victory over Business.

### British Navy in Shanghai Forms Football Team; Seeks Friendly Match with Tung Wah

It will now open this Saturday with two opening matches, plus an exhibition match between Longjie and Mengxian. The Deputy Director of the Education Bureau, Li, will be invited to kick off the event.

### Sideline Notes on Basketball

As predicted by this newspaper, Chun Mao lost to Ren Yu by a close margin in last night's basketball league game. The performance of both teams was up to their usual standards, and the match was a true measure of their respective strengths. Chun Mao's shooting skills were slightly inferior, and their three-basket deficit was well-deserved.

Ren Yu's Wang Huaiting, Sun Guozheng, and Shen Pengju performed well, but Yao Wenyi was out of sorts. Chun Mao's Fushan was tightly guarded, relying only on Jiabiao and Fuqiang for occasional scores, and He Hanfu missed several long-range shots. Xianzheng also did more harm than good.

Fushan, lacking opportunities to attack, switched to defense, but Ren Yu had many players skilled at shooting from the baseline, and could easily score even when pressured to the corners. Chun Mao's defense last night was not solid, and they seemed to lack both awareness and confidence.

Near the end of the game, Sun Guozheng fouled out, and Chun Mao was only one basket behind, hoping to turn the game around. However, Liang Yongjia made a powerful shot, dampening Chun Mao's morale.

Apart from an early 5-0 lead, Chun Mao was always chasing the game, trailing by five or six points.

Huang Tianlie's illness and the lack of replacements were also a major blow to Chun Mao. (Changnian)

### President Song Meets with Executive Committee of Export Promotion Council; Explains Export Promotion Policies; Transportation Inconvenience and Price Instability Offset Foreign Exchange Effects

[Our Dispatch] President Song had not yet formally met with the executive committee members and appointed advisors of the Export Promotion Council since its establishment. Yesterday, from 11:00 AM to 12:30 PM, he specially convened a meeting with relevant personnel of the council at the Bank of China Building. Attendees included Chairman Zu Yi, executive committee members Lin Fengbao, Liu Gongyun, and Shen Peirui, advisors Shu Yunzhang, Wang Yangxian, Chen Changtong, Guo Zixun, Ma Baozhi, Hu Yunqiu, Xu Xiekang, Ouyang Lun, Xu Guangchi, Mike, Rogers, Little, Keshiwei, and Zhang Sili. President Song elaborated on the government's export promotion policy and expressed his hope that all executive committee members and advisors would work hard to assist in studying ways to increase production and remove export difficulties. Subsequently, the attendees expressed their views, which are summarized as follows: (1) Transportation inconvenience is the biggest obstacle to export trade and urgently needs to be resolved. For example, the current shipping cost from Hankou to Shanghai is 20% higher than the shipping cost from Shanghai to the United States. (2) The government's adjustment of the exchange rate should help export trade. However, the price of export goods must remain stable. Otherwise, the benefits of the exchange rate adjustment will be offset by the increase in prices. As a result, the exchange rate adjustment will not be effective. For example, the prices of tung oil and bristles have already risen by 50% recently. (3) Although the government has issued a large number of production loans through the Four Joint Offices, the actual beneficiaries are large-scale manufacturers in cities. Small producers of export goods in the interior do not even know the nature of the Four Joint Offices. Moreover, it often takes more than a month for export goods to be shipped to Shanghai. Therefore, it is hoped that these small producers will be provided with financial support. (4) Increasing the production of yarn is believed to be possible, but the problem of electricity supply needs to be solved. (5) Smuggling in South China should be stopped quickly, and it is hoped that the Yuehan Railway will be fully opened as soon as possible. (6) The United Kingdom has a strong demand for Chinese eggs, and export trade should be promoted immediately. After listening to the opinions of the attendees, President Song took notes and promised to give full consideration and solve the problems separately.

### Central Bank's Purchase of US Dollars Increasingly Crowded Yesterday

[Our Dispatch] The Central Bank continued to purchase gold and US dollars at the new exchange rate yesterday. The number of people seeking to exchange currency was higher than in previous days, with most seeking to exchange US dollars. In front of the foreign exchange counter in the business bureau on the second floor, people lined up in rows. Before exchanging US dollars yesterday, it was necessary to fill out a special printed exchange application form provided by the bank. Banknotes of 10 yuan and below and 20 yuan and above had to be filled out separately. It is said that the application procedure will be cancelled from today onwards, and the Central Bank will directly exchange currency based on the banknotes. According to a person in charge of the bank's business bureau, the bank uniformly accepts all denominations of US dollars and has not refused to accept US dollars of 50 yuan or more. Although the exchange volume yesterday was not clearly counted, it is estimated that it was higher than the 250,000 yuan in previous days. The amount of gold exchanged was not as high as that of US dollars, because people believe that the Central Bank's exchange rate is too low, so there were few people seeking to exchange gold. Even those who did exchange gold were mostly banks and firms exchanging it to adjust their positions. The exact number is impossible to estimate.

### Government Bonds' Fluctuations Limited

Government bonds were relatively stable yesterday. Room 540 had buyers, Room 604 advanced then retreated, while Rooms 445 and 552 were sellers. The overall trend was limited. The morning opened at 6200 yuan, rising as high as 7300 yuan before falling back to 5700 yuan. The midday market was..., and the result was that all bonds except Type D rose slightly compared to the previous close. The volume traded was 7 million yuan.

### Foreign Stock Market Performed Moderately

Foreign stocks rebounded yesterday. Yi Sha saw a high price of 15,000 yuan in the afternoon before leveling off. Small stocks declined slightly from their highs. The overall performance was moderate. Compared to the previous close, Yi Sha and Navigation each rose by a little more than 0.5%, while British United and Defeng Steel each rose by about 0.5%. The rest declined slightly.

### Money Exchange Shops Temporarily Suspend Business; Emergency Meeting to be Held Today

[Our Dispatch] Wang Yuncheng, chairman of the Money Exchange Association, told reporters yesterday that all members of the industry have decided to temporarily suspend business until the government's new measures are announced. However, since there are many members in the industry, it is inevitable that there will be both good and bad. Therefore, an emergency meeting will be held at 3:00 PM tomorrow to urge all members to comply with the law and not engage in illegal transactions to avoid damaging the industry's reputation. In addition, some executive directors have proposed to organize an inspection team to supervise the actions of members, which will also be discussed at tomorrow's meeting.

### Sugar Prices Weaken Again

The sugar market weakened again yesterday due to sluggish sales. The association's prices were lowered; spot medium and white sugars continued to drop slightly, while local sugars also fell by 3-5,000 yuan. Shundeqing opened at 122,000 yuan to 118,000 yuan, followed by 115,000 yuan. Daoqing opened at 125,000 yuan. A total of 2-300 bags were traded. The market is expected to rebound only when demand picks up.

Another report: The Shanghai Office of the Taiwan Sugar Corporation will begin distributing sugar for the seventh time this Thursday (the 20th). In order to suppress sugar prices, the distribution of medium and red sugars will be temporarily suspended this time. The recent market price of coarse sugar has fallen to 193,000 yuan, only 3,000 yuan higher than the distribution price, and the situation suggests that there may be further declines. The company has decided to distribute a total of 29,923 bags of greedy sugar. Due to the recent decline in sugar prices, the number of applications for sugar this time is less than the sixth distribution.

### Market Interest Rates

If the Plan is Fully Implemented, Interest Rates are Expected to Return to Lower Levels Soon

[Our Dispatch] Finance Minister Xu Baiyuan told reporters yesterday that if the government's emergency economic measures are fully implemented and all conditions are met, he guarantees that market interest rates in the city will fall to within 10% within a month.

### The Tea Market Remains Quiet

The tea market remained quiet yesterday, with few transactions. After the morning opening, the buying interest seemed active on the surface, but there were few sellers. Moreover, the asking prices were high and lacked standards. It is said that the top Qimen tea from 1945 was being quoted at 1.5 million yuan per dan, and the Chen Special Qimen tea from 1934 was also being quoted near 1 million yuan. Other new and old miniature teas and Zhenmei green teas were priced at 4-500,000 yuan to 1.2-300,000 yuan per dan. As a result, negotiations between buyers and sellers were not successful, and the market remained quiet. According to the current situation, if holders of goods remain unwilling to compromise, the quiet situation is likely to continue.

### With Favorable Buying News in the Final Minutes, the Stock Market's Rise Flourishes Again; Mei Ya and Xin Ya, Zhong Fa All Hit Limit Up

Yesterday, under tight monetary conditions, the stock market was anxious and uneasy. In addition, with the impending expiration of contracts, gains were quickly followed by declines. Only Mei Ya continued to rise due to active buying. However, in the last ten minutes, the market suddenly surged on rumors of favorable buying, ending the day at high prices.

Buying interest suddenly surged. Numbers 152, 198, 197, 76, 224, and 145 competed to buy repeatedly. Mei Ya, with very strong buying interest from Numbers 226 and 78, surged suddenly, ending the day at a high.

For deferred delivery, Deyong Yarn, Xinhe, and Jingfu each rose by a little more than 0.5%, Xinguang rose by a little less than 0.5%, Huafeng rose by a little less than 10%, Mei Ya hit the limit up.

### Silver Shop Representatives' Petition: Four Recommendations Proposed

[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] The Gold Shops Association of this city, facing stagnation after the cessation of gold trading, besides petitioning the Social Affairs Bureau for relief the day before yesterday, also convened a joint meeting of directors and supervisors in the afternoon to discuss future business methods. They also dispatched Qiu Tianbao, Yang Qinghe, Yao Huifang, Yao Guiqing, Wu Pengnian, and other responsible representatives from Bao Cheng and other gold shops to the Municipal Government twice yesterday to petition Mayor Wu, putting forward four demands: (1) The weight of each piece of jewelry produced and sold by gold shops should not exceed two taels (關平二兩) and small bars should not be melted down for sale. (2) Gold shops should be allowed to collect scrap gold jewelry, with prices following regulations set by the Central Bank. (3) Gold collected should be used for making jewelry; any surplus should be sold to the Central Bank, and if there is a shortage, the Central Bank should be asked to allocate it. (4) Operating profit should be determined by the Gold Shops Business Association with reference to the situation and the cost of living index, and with the consent of the Central Bank. The mayor has promised to consider these requests, but the entire plan must await the Central Government's promulgation of measures regarding gold jewelry before a final decision can be made.

### Joint Venture Funds Not Deposited with Bank of Communications; Guidance Association Cannot Distribute Raw Materials

[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] The Silk Weaving Export Guidance Committee held a meeting yesterday morning around 9:00 AM, presided over by Chairman Lin Fengbao in person. After discussion, those present believed that since the establishment of the silk weaving joint venture company and the Guidance Committee, the company has not complied with the joint regulations by depositing all of the raised capital of 500 million yuan into the approved Bank of Communications, resulting in the Guidance Committee being unable to issue raw materials and labor costs in preparation for starting work. Although the joint venture company has requested the issuance of raw materials on the grounds that workers are about to strike and machines are idle, the Committee decided that it will only consider issuing materials after all the funds have been deposited into the Bank of Communications.

### Flour Mills Request Loans to Support Flour Rationing Policy

[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] The Four Banks Joint Treasury and the Municipal Bank have decided to lend 2 billion yuan to the five major flour mills, Maoxin, Fuxin, Fufeng, Huafeng, and Yutong, as funds for purchasing wheat. According to a responsible person at the Fuxin Flour Mill, the flour mills are requesting loans not to relieve their own difficulties, but to support the government's flour rationing policy. Because wheat prices have recently soared to 76,000 yuan per dan (擔), the cost of each bag of flour should be above 50,000 yuan, including raw materials and labor. In order to maintain rationing, the flour mills rely not only on government subsidies, but also on constantly subsidizing themselves, which depleted most of the wheat that the flour mills had accumulated in the past. The purpose of requesting loans is to prevent the cessation of flour rationing in this difficult environment. However, as the previous profits of the flour mills have already been used up for subsidies, they will not be able to subsidize in the future. It is not known whether the government will adopt a subsidy policy or a cost policy. Therefore, how to use this loan will depend on the government's policy.

Another Dispatch: The flour supply in this city is still being rationed by Shanxin Zhou at 12,000 bags of Lilang flour per day, and the negotiated price has not changed. However, starting from the 23rd of this month, it will be changed to rationed domestically produced flour, milled by the five major flour mills, Fuxin, Fu Zhi, Maoxin, Hua Yan, and Yutong, with Mayor Wu assisting in borrowing 2 billion yuan from the Four Banks Joint Treasury. The loan has been promised by the Four Banks Joint Treasury, and the flour mills have purchased wheat from various wheat-producing areas. The first batch of 110,000 dan (擔) has already arrived and is being milled intensively in order to be rationed at that time. Representatives of the five flour mills, Xi Debing, Rong Yiren, and Qian Shouchun, visited Mayor Wu at the Municipal Government yesterday afternoon to ask for instructions on the rationing procedures starting from the 23rd. Therefore, the serious flour panic problem can be resolved.

### White Coal Market Prices Strong

White coal supplies are scarce, and due to the severe cold weather, sales are extremely strong, and the market is strong. The transaction price of Hong Kuai (鴻　塊) has reached 1.7 million yuan. The market for bituminous coal is relatively soft because 18,900 tons of coal for civilian factories will be allocated soon. However, asking prices are not willing to lower.

### Loans Not Allowed to Be Extended; Money Market Remains Tight

[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] It is reported that the recent tightness in the money market in this city is due to the fact that depositors who were restricted from depositing and withdrawing last Saturday made withdrawals from various banks before the holiday. Therefore, the money market of each bank was greatly drained, and the exchange was quite tight. On Monday of this week, the China Trust Bureau Textile Construction Company and others sold materials, which contracted a large amount of money. The result of the exchange of each bank on Monday was that the four banks and two bureaus were short of more than 20 billion yuan. Yesterday, it improved slightly, but the four banks and two bureaus were only short of 1 billion yuan. It is heard that the four banks and two bureaus have recently not allowed the extension of various loans that have expired. The amount of money recovered successively is also huge, so the money market is extremely tight.

### Barter Trade with Japan Continues to Be Handled

[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] The Central Trust Bureau, acting as the government's agent for barter trade with Japan, requested the import of 10 million pit props from Japan this year, but Japan can only supply 4 million. We also requested that Japan continue to supply rayon, but it is likely that the quantity that can be supplied will not be large, as Japanese inventory is exhausted and new production is not large. In addition, about ten transportation materials must also be imported from Japan. Japan requested that our country supply 1 million tons of edible salt, and it is currently planned to supply more than 700,000 tons. To date, 50,000 tons have been shipped out.

### Rice Arrives Vigorously; Early Rice Falls Below 100,000 Yuan; Flour Market Sluggish; Vegetable Oil Continues to Decline

Yesterday's rice arrival statistics broke the record for the past few months. The South City Market arrived with 22,84146 shi (石), the North City Market arrived with 9,624 shi (石), for a total of 12,000 shi (石). The sources from all roads are surging vigorously. At this time, the government is implementing emergency economic measures, and will strictly manage people's food. Coupled with the tight money supply, the owners are eager to sell, while the streets are mostly waiting and watching, and the market is declining section by section. Thick and thin japonica rice continue to decline by 5,600 yuan, each grade of indica rice fell by 3,400 yuan, Yin Bian Yuan (蔭變元) also fell by 5,600 yuan, Changxi japonica price is at 112,000 yuan, and early rice has fallen below 100,000 yuan. The North City price is lower than the South City.

Flour: another decline reported, the rice market continues to weaken, the market is sluggish, the flour mill is constantly distributing, the actual sales are feeling the obstruction, the market is full of selling atmosphere. But the receiving is lacking, the transaction is still rare, and the market price is weakening step by step. In the morning, the ship powder was 50,000 yuan, Lilang foreign powder was 70,000 yuan, and the small price declined by 2,000 yuan, with only a few transactions. The later market situation allows the emptiness, and the Lilang ocean flour fell below 70,000 yuan in the afternoon, which was 68,500 yuan, and the ship powder was heard that 48,000 yuan still has a family, and the actual fall is 3,400 yuan compared to the previous day, and the bran is tired with the flour market about 2,000 yuan. The wheat ground is very strong, but there is no transaction.

Edible Oil: Continuing the fatigue of the last few days, coupled with the close monitoring of the Social Bureau, the market is afraid, and the transactions are lonely. The raw materials (raw peanut soybean) step down, the merchants and retail investors are rushing to sell, but the sales are sluggish, the price of raw oil is about 20,000 yuan, and the price of raw oil is about 200,000 yuan on the edge, and the bean oil market is also reduced by 10,000 yuan. The price of small car sesame oil fell by 10,000 yuan, and the price of raw vegetable oil at this factory retreated to 235,000 yuan.

Miscellaneous Grains: All reported weak, and there are not enough sources of soybeans, and the sales are not smooth, and continue to plummet by 3,400 yuan, and Pinghu beans also dumped by 5,600 yuan. The raw materials are more than the demand, and the price is down by about 10,000 yuan. Because the Zhongzhi factory is trying to open up, the price of sesame fell by 20,000 yuan. The red bean market continued to fall by 4,000 yuan, and the green bean sales slowed down, and also fell by 10,000 yuan. Red sorghum and corn are gradually reduced by 2,000 yuan, and the sales of bean cake are narrow, and the price is reduced by 2,000 yuan. Only broad beans are in the midst of the fatigue of each product, and the shouting price is still very strong, but there is no transaction.

### Yarn Market Customer Sales Quiet

Yesterday, the yarn market still did not improve, customer sales were still quiet, and the money market was tight as before. Various yarns below 42 counts fell again by 210,000, and the special double horse first fell to 3.6 million, followed by absorption from the Cantonese gang, and rose to 3.95 million at the close, which was more than 100,000 yuan better than yesterday. However, people are still not optimistic.

### Manufacturers Buy Back Cotton Yarn; Pricing Methods Specified

[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] According to the Textile Management Committee (1) The pricing method for each factory to buy back cotton yarn for its own weaving will be handled according to the fourth day's price of the Textile Construction Acting and Operating Office, starting from the date when each factory submits the cotton yarn sales notice to the Textile Management Committee. (2) After each factory submits the cotton yarn sales notice to the Textile Management Committee, if the grade approval procedure cannot be completed within three days due to the inspection procedure, the majority of the yarn price will be paid first on the fourth day to avoid the turnover of each factory. (3) The original standard for the method of inspecting the quality of cotton yarn was eight types. It is now decided that item 8, the bundling package, will not be included in the inspection standard. Also, item 6, the content of the skein, and item 7, the length of the skein circle, will also not be included temporarily. It will be restored to the list from April 1.

### Batch of Foreign Flour Arrives at the Port

[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] Flour arrived at the port yesterday. The Dashun Wheel, represented by Baoli Company, is a new wheel purchased by the Materials Supply Bureau in Canada. It was the first batch in Shanghai yesterday. 3,450 packages of flour were loaded from Vancouver. The flour was purchased by the China Trust Bureau.

### Central Bank Adjusts Exchange Rates in Various Regions; Chongqing Banks Request to Increase Exchange Amount Denied

Amidst the gold and currency turmoil, applications for remittances in various regions have undergone drastic changes. Various companies and banks have transferred funds to Shanghai to snap up materials and gold and currency, and the exchange fee has increased to more than 100 yuan per thousand. Since the government announced emergency economic measures, the money supply in various regions has turned tight. According to the report received by the Bank of China, the exchange fee in Qingdao is 40 yuan, Hankou is 20 yuan, Guangzhou is 20 to 30 yuan, and Wenzhou is as high as 110 yuan, which is too far from the official exchange rate. The Central Bank has specially considered the market conditions in various regions and stipulated the exchange rate to various regions for the four banks and two bureaus on the 17th. The rates for Fujian, Guangdong, Zhejiang, and other regions have been adjusted, and some have doubled. Xiamen and Fuzhou in Fujian have been adjusted to 28 yuan, an increase of 3 yuan. Other regions remain at 30 yuan. Shantou in Guangdong is 50 yuan, an increase of 10 yuan, and other regions are 50 yuan, an increase of 5 yuan. Shandong is 10 yuan, an increase of 5 yuan. In Hubei, only Hankou and Wuchang are 5 yuan, an increase of 3 yuan. In Zhejiang, only Wenzhou is 25 yuan, an increase of 10 yuan. There is no change in Shanxi, Guizhou, Yunnan, Sichuan, Shaanxi, Gansu, Qinghai, Xikang, Suiyuan, Xinjiang, Hebei, Guangxi, Anhui, and other regions. In addition, the Central Bank previously maintained the original regulations because commercial banks in Chongqing and other regions have repeatedly requested to increase the amount of remittances. Because the various commercial groups come to Shanghai to purchase goods, Shanghai can do import remittance, and various regions can apply for remittance to the national banks.

### Industrial Raw Materials Weaken

Since the adjustment of the foreign exchange rate, industrial raw materials were not traded the day before yesterday, and the market was extremely chaotic. Yesterday, because the silver market was tight, prices weakened except for a slight increase in sulfuric acid. The price of Yuepai caustic soda was 6 million yuan, and the price of American caustic soda was 5.8 million yuan. The price of Yuepai soda ash once rose to 500,000 yuan per bag, and the current market price is 350,000 yuan. Magali soda ash fell from 280,000 yuan to 220,000 yuan. Glycerin fell by 200,000 yuan, and the asking price per onion was 1.5 million yuan. Bleaching powder fell from 2.6 million yuan per supplement to 2 million yuan. Coconut oil fell from 800,000 yuan per dan (担) to 550,000 yuan. The feet of each thing are very strong, and the decline is very small.

### Pig Bristles Opening Price Not Available; Export Price Quite Cost-Effective

The supply of pig bristles in the Shanghai market is scarce, and the export price is difficult to match the domestic price. After the foreign exchange rate was raised yesterday, the merchants were waiting for the situation in the producing area to determine the opening price in Shanghai. Therefore, there was no opening price until late at night. According to people in the industry, the overseas market price of Chongqing No. 27 for delivery in New York is US$2.7 per pound, and each Sima dan (司馬担) (i.e., one box of 133 pounds) is equivalent to 4.2 million national currency. The price of Hankou No. 17 bristles is 4.1 yuan per pound, and each Sima dan is about 6.5 million national currency. The price of Shanghai No. 17 bristles is 2 yuan per pound, which is about 3.2 million national currency. After removing taxes and water feet, the current domestic price can be increased a lot.

### Tung Oil Asking Price Chaotic

The tung oil market is rampant due to the rampant smuggling in Guangzhou. Therefore, normal exports have run counter to market prices, and inventories in various places are extremely thin. The tung oil production area of Hunan and Hubei tung oil is almost entirely through the Yuehan Road (粵漢路) to Guangzhou, and transshipped to Hong Kong. Only the Zhongzhi factory has a small amount of tung oil exports in this city. Since each merchant has no source and the export price is not in line, and the market price has risen sharply from the producing area, it is rising slowly. Yesterday's market has raised the foreign exchange, and the latest New York Telegraph price is 3.75 US dollars per pound for New York delivery, which has increased the export value to 500,000 yuan per dan (担) (121 pounds). It seems that the export prospect is optimistic. Yesterday's asking price was as high as 450,000 yuan per dan (担), which has risen by 80,000 yuan from 380,000 yuan per dan (担) last Saturday, but the official market is still unable to open.

### Wool Exports Hopeful After Exchange Rate Adjustment

The Shanghai wool price has not been officially opened yet, and the price of wool in the producing area is said to have been slightly higher, but very few people went to purchase it. The sheep wool production season in this spring will be more than a month later, so the current wool stock in the producing area is still the autumn wool last year. After the foreign exchange was revised this time, the wool that can be exported in Shanghai is estimated to be about 10,000 dan (担). A certain fur shop in this question received a telegram from abroad, because the wool sample sent can only be used for manufacturing blankets, etc., so its offer is 4.2 corners per pound of net goods. If it is a wool product (i.e., goods that have not been sorted and selected), it must be priced at 60% off. However, according to people in the industry, according to the conversion of the price, the wool that has been shipped to foreign countries and not sold, and the stock wool in this city, if the foreign sales are good, it can be slightly profitable, and sold as much as possible. However, the future situation depends on how much the price in the producing area rises to and whether the price abroad falls.

### Tanglou Thirty Miles of Fragrant Snow Sea

— Hangzhou, 10th [date not given]. Special Correspondent Chu Yusheng of this newspaper.

As spring approaches, the people who live on the shores of West Lake, and those who are thinking of coming to West Lake to play, will be drawn to the plum blossoms. Perhaps in this turbid world, only the plum still maintains its purity and loftiness, fearless of frost and snow, symbolizing the spirit of hard work, perseverance, and indomitability of our Chinese nation. In order to report on the plum blossoms, the reporter has visited Lin Bu's former residence—Solitary Hill—three times, and Lingfeng twice, but the spring plum blossoms are still shy and unwilling to show their faces. On the 8th, I went to Solitary Hill again with a few friends in a boat, but there was still no news of blooming. The woman selling tea at Fanghe Pavilion told me: "When the weather gets warmer, they will slowly open." On the 9th, I decided to go to Chaoshan, Tangqi, to explore the plum blossoms. Because there was no sign at the intersection of the three roads to Tangqi, we almost sent us to Haining. We came back again, asked passers-by, and finally embarked on the road to Tangqi. The road was very bumpy. Several bridges could still be seen, and they were built elaborately before the war. We met several buses of the Transportation Department on the road, and they were shaking and swaying. I think the road should be repaired, and a prominent sign should be nailed at the intersection, so that those who admire the plum blossoms in the future will not take the wrong path.

A Prosperous Town of Fruit Production

Speaking of Tanglou, this is a relatively large and prosperous town, known for its fruits. The canal runs through the whole area, with many ports and rivers. There is more land than fields, and most people make a living by picking and selling fruits. The famous Tangqi loquat can produce 80,000 to 90,000 loads per year, plums can produce 120,000 to 130,000 loads, lotus roots can produce 30,000 to 40,000 loads, and other bayberries, peaches, sugar cane, water chestnuts, and cherries have a large output. Loquats are divided into red and white. The white sand loquat is so tender to the touch that it is not easy to transport. The lotus root is crushed when it falls to the ground, and it is indescribably tender. I think the white sand loquat is so tender, it is really precious, and we should try to improve the transportation in the future, so that this sweet loquat will not be enjoyed only by the people of Tangqi. Other fruits are sold to Shanghai, Suzhou, Hangzhou and other places. There is an old store called Huichang in Tangqi Town, specializing in the production of candied fruits, and the business is booming. Later, people from Suzhou and Shanghai came to purchase. Some purchased raw fruits and brought them back to make their own. Shanghai Guanshengyuan came to Tangqi to build a plum forest specifically for the production of candied plums, and Suzhou Zhangxiangfeng also set up a line every year to search for plums. This year, Shanghai's Meilin Company will set up a factory in Tanglou, specializing in the production of candied fruit canned foods.

Since most people in Tangqi make a living by selling fruits, the sales of fruits last year were not bad, so this strong counter-current did not affect them fortunately, but due to the impact of the general economic downturn in the country, it is inevitable that they also appear strong on the outside but empty inside.

We asked the locals to accompany us back to Chaoshan, which is about six Huali (華里). The tour companion told me: "These days, there has been an endless stream of cars. They all came to explore the plum blossoms, thinking that the plum blossoms should bloom in the first month, but who knew that the plum blossoms of Chaoshan should be after the Awakening of Insects." The plum blossoms of Chaoshan are called home plums, and the home plums bear large fruits. The plums of Solitary Hill and Lingfeng are wild plums, and wild plums are early-maturing and bear small fruits. The plum area here is centered on the Daming Hall of Chaoshan, east to Taishan, Tunli, southwest to Dushan, Qiancun, north to Guishan, Dongxi two villages, Ma'an, Huanggu, Bai Li Zhushan, along Dongjia Bridge, Quanzhang and across Jiaoxi, surrounded by more than 30 Li (里), criss-crossed, about millions of trees. When the flowers bloom, the fragrance is heard more than ten miles away, the flower paths are winding, the chickens crow and the dogs bark, which has the fun of a paradise. The painter Wu Changshuo loved this holy land, so he had the sentence "Plum blossoms are what I love, and I will be buried in Chaoshan after death." After Wu's death, he was buried here, with an epitaph written by Zhang Binglin and written by Yu Youren. There is also a stone statue of Wu, holding a book in his hand, overlooking the plum blossoms.

Song Plum by the Temple Side; Plum Forest in Front of the Temple

We were led to Daming Hall, where there is Bao Ci Temple. There are dozens of plum trees in front of the temple, and the buds on the branches are only sprouting and have not yet blossomed. A Song Plum on the side of the temple, half of which is withered and old, and half of which is still full of life, stands alone on a stone. A Song Plum Pavilion has been built in front of the plum, and Wu Changshuo and others have inscribed couplets. The buds of this Song Plum seem to be larger than other trees, and the flowers are mostly six-petaled, which is very different from ordinary plums. She has read all the human disasters and sorrows, and still maintains the vigor of youth, which is a great warning to those who are depressed.

Enter Bao Ci Temple, climb Xianghai Pavilion, and look down on the plum forest in front of the building. When the plum blossoms are in full bloom, it is like riding a boat, wandering on the Xianghai, at that time all worldly thoughts disappear, and a kind of selfless spirit rises again. The Kang Youwei's Zhongtang couplet is hung upstairs, all of which are reading praises to this great fragrant snow sea. Downstairs, winding and twisting, the steps lead to the back hall. In the hall, there is a stone carved painting tablet of Guanzizai, with vigorous brush strokes and lifelike posture. It turns out that it was written by Wu Daozi of the Tang Dynasty. On both sides is a couplet, which is titled by Yu Quyuan: "Buddha stone does not grind Tang pen and ink, immortal plum still occupies Song years." It is enough to shine the Tang paintings and Song Mei are still there!

The tour companion told me: "Before the war, there were also many plum branches beside the highway, which were cut down by the enemy and puppets." I think we can continue to plant peach and plum trees in the future, and even this more than 20-kilometer-long highway can be planted with peach and plum trees, so that tourists can follow the plum blossoms and complete a great scenic spot.

I have studied why there are so many plum blossoms in Chaoshan. According to research, the Song Dynasty moved south and established its capital in present-day Hangzhou. Princess Song Fu built a villa in Tangqi, and Chaoshan should be the location of the plum garden. These classics are detailed in the chronicles of Hangzhou or Tangqi. We don't need to deeply study them, but we recognize Tangqi as a vast farm, with excellent water conservancy and soil conditions, and plums are everyone's agricultural products. If we can advocate improvement, we can not only create a scenic spot, but also use this wealth to enrich the rural economy.

### Xi'an in the Cold of Spring

— Xi'an Air Mail, February 10th, by our Xi'an reporter, Li Chi

After passing "Yangguan," passing "Yinguan," passing "Yuanji," and passing "Lichun," it is spring, but the warm spring sun always hides in the gloomy clouds. Yesterday, an inch of thick snow fell, truly embodying the cold of spring, still enveloping the ancient city of Chang'an.

"New Year" is a "checkpoint"; in addition to the two Yuan festivals, ordinary people face 365 difficult hurdles in life. Old news again: this "Yinguan" is particularly difficult for some wealthy individuals because the 2 billion loan borrowed from the Four Banks for life-saving during "Yangguan" must be repaid before "Yinguan," making people worry if the "collapsing wind" spreading everywhere will blow into Guanzhong. Don't worry, an unexpected "rescue" has arrived. The eastern section of the Longhai Railway is blocked. The news spreads, and the market value of all Shanghai and American goods is like a horse off the rein, shrimp in a pot, running and jumping. Gold does not lag behind, passing 400,000, nearly "Five Checkpoints," slaying "Six Generals," passing "Seven Immortals." One and a half million worth of flour is being held back, not selling at the current price of 50,000 to 60,000, watching it rise to 70,000 to 80,000, the negotiating chip is equivalent to "drawing with four opponents." ... The one calculating on the abacus changed from anxiety to laughter. New Year gongs and drums, Lantern Festival lanterns, the streets seem to be a scene of complete peace!

The Spring Festival is Not Lively

Unfortunately, while we speak of peace, the flames of war are everywhere, a beautiful scene, but the difficulty of livelihood is hard to hide. Foreigners take the sales of Christmas gifts as an indicator of economic prosperity; similarly, the consumption during the Chinese New Year and Lantern Festival can measure the level of social purchasing power. This spring, the merchants selling New Year goods all shake their heads, whether wholesale or small vendors selling firecrackers by the roadside. The lantern market during the "Shangyuan" is crowded, but the most popular are still the cheapest small lanterns. The villagers buy one as a formality. In the past, the "Lantern Festival" would last three nights, but this year only the first night had a few sparks sparsely decorating the cold spring night sky. Children are not satisfied, and adults are reminiscing about the Lantern Festival nights before last year.

Similar in nature to Shanghai's City God Temple, the Minle Garden area of Xi'an has passed a desolate Spring Festival that should have been bustling. In the storytelling theaters around 2 or 3 pm on a festive afternoon, there are only one or two customers who can afford a cup of clear tea costing 600 yuan. Where can the hungry eyes of the drum girls on stage find prey? In the fourth-class public prostitution area next to it, there is still snow on the thatched roofs. The "meat market" where transactions can be made for the price of two or three pounds of flour cannot afford to burn charcoal. Is it the foul smoke of burning horse manure that irritates the eyes of those waiting to be "sold" by the door, causing them to shed tears? Everywhere is cold!

Shadows of Life

The shadows of life are constantly tracking. The price index for January has been released: taking the average of the first half of the 26th year as the base of 100, the Xi'an wholesale price index for January of this year is 1.13 million, and the retail price index is 1.12 million. Looking at the cost of living index for civil servants in the Xi'an area, January of this year has increased by 13,300 times compared to the first half of the 26th year of the Republic! This is a figure that the ruling authorities should seriously consider, a merciless figure. According to the current central standards, the cost-of-living allowance for Xi'an public educators is 110,000 yuan, with a salary increase of 750 times. The numbers are starkly in front of us. An allowance of 110,000 yuan is only equivalent to eight yuan before the war. A salary of 100 yuan, and the current income of 75,000 yuan, is also only equivalent to 5.6 yuan before the war! In total, a person with a salary of 100 yuan, although inflated to 185,000 yuan now, can only be exchanged for goods in Xi'an equivalent to 13.6 yuan before the war. An average person with a family of five can actually obtain only 2.7 yuan per person. The numbers speak for themselves!

The tuition fee for middle school students this semester has increased to 120,000, and there were rumors of 200,000. Even 200,000 is only equivalent to 15 yuan before the war, which is not too much, but the reporter saw an old teacher unable to continue to afford his children's middle school education this spring. Those who want to study cannot afford such a large burden, and those who teach do not have enough income to cover their expenses. This disconnect has a profound impact, and its negative consequences may continue into the 1920s.

Public educators in the Xi'an area have repeatedly appealed because the prices here have caught up with those in Beijing and Shanghai, but their treatment is ranked in the third tier nationwide. This unreasonable discrimination, as evidenced by the above figures, really needs to be improved.

Industrial and Commercial Solutions

Will the nationwide industrial and commercial crisis really not strike Shaanxi? Of course, it will not be an exception. The question is only when and to what extent. Business leaders in the city held a symposium today at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to jointly discuss rescue plans. Several concrete measures were formulated at the meeting, mainly: (1) Following the precedent of Beijing and Shanghai, a "loan syndicate" will be organized by more than 80 military units from the city's commercial banks and money shops to borrow large sums from the Four Banks and re-lend them to small and medium-sized businesses. (2) The amount, allocation, methods, procedures, etc., will be formulated by industrial and commercial organizations first and then reviewed by the banking industry. (3) The banking industry will establish a reserve fund. (4) Loan collateral can be either machinery or manufactured goods. (5) Large commercial and industrial enterprises may not apply for this type of loan. ...

Late-Life Pain

### Old Mother Mourns American Soldier, Wang Lingji Presents Porcelain to Console Her

— Nanchang, February 12th

Jiangxi Provincial Chairman Wang Lingji recently received a letter from an elderly American woman stating that her son, Mike McLellan, flew a C-10 aircraft to assist ground troops during the Chinese War of Resistance and was killed in the skies over Jiangxi. Hearing that Jiangxi Province will establish a national porcelain kiln, she requested a piece of product from the kiln as a memorial to ease her late-life sorrow for her son.

The porcelain that this old woman hoped to receive has now been fired. The porcelain was procured by Chairman Wang Lingji entrusting the Fuliang County government to arrange for it. There are a total of four pieces of porcelain, including a pair of porcelain vases and a pair of porcelain bowls. The blanks are all top-quality products. The vases are seven inches high, two inches in diameter at the mouth, and three inches wide. The bowls are two inches high and four inches in diameter at the mouth. The overall pattern on the vases, except for two areas reserved for painting, imitates the Qianlong imperial kiln's "hanging lamp foreign lotus brocade ground." The four paintings on the vases are all eagles, one titled "Looking Far Ahead" and the other titled "Qi Fills the Blue Void." The bowls are as thin as paper, as white as jade, and painted with a "Three Heroes Standing Together" picture. The mouths and bottoms of the vases and bowls are all coated with red gold, exquisite and unparalleled. The artist who did the painting and decoration was Mr. Liu Yucen, a famous painter from Jingdezhen.

### Although the Gate of Guanzhong is Open, Some Still Want to Close Themselves Off

The most successful way to implement a measure is through "official document implementation," and there will probably be a period for that. Even if it is implemented, it is only a "treat the head when it hurts" temporary solution, not a thorough countermeasure. Some newspapers have advocated trying to minimize the connection between Xi'an's industrial and commercial activities and the economic centers of Beijing and Shanghai. In fact, Xi'an has recently had times when it could not remit money to Shanghai, which is probably a concrete measure of this "theory." We immediately saw the consequences: the black market remittance rate suddenly increased, increasing the costs for the business community and the burden for consumers. The gate of Guanzhong is open, but some want to close themselves off.

Recently, there seem to be rumors circulating in the market that are difficult to judge, both rumors and reports. A few days ago, an evening newspaper used "Unclear Situation in Taiyuan" as a headline, while a certain newspaper yesterday "remotely corresponding" with "Capture of Linyi" as the headline. In addition, some people used the tone of "Quietly Telling You" to talk about the Xunhua, Sanyuan, and Yijun counties south of the Shaanxi-North bunker line, saying this and that. Others described the Zhengwu County north of the Qinling Mountains and Shang County in southern Shaanxi in great detail, as if they had seen it all with their own eyes. However, the news policy from above remains unchanged. ...

The sky is gloomy, and the north wind is blowing. This is a sign of snowfall in the Northwest. The footsteps of spring are still far away!

### Streetcar Numbers Should Have Additional Devices

Editor:

On the twelfth of this month, I went to Zhabei for business. It rained that day, so I wore a raincoat. When I returned, I hired a pedicab at the intersection of Henan North Road and Wujin Road, and placed the raincoat on the pedicab. When I arrived at my doorstep, I got out of the pedicab in a hurry and forgot the raincoat on the pedicab. After I found out, the pedicab was already far away. I think if other people forget more valuable items, it might lead to unfortunate things like bankruptcy and suicide. Therefore, I suggest that the Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities, in addition to the magnetic license plate issued on the back of pedicabs, also produce and issue a small enamel plate with the same number as the license, installed in a place easily visible to passengers. In this way, passengers who carry items can record the number. In case of forgetting, they can track down the lost items by the number. (Su Huimin)

Reply to Shi Choushi

Although a notice was posted in the newspaper, there was no response. Further investigation of this case revealed that the Civil Affairs Department had received a complaint from the said Shi Choushi, which was investigated and replied to by the Third District Administrative Inspector's Office, stating that the allegations against the police officer were not true, and the original plaintiff was also non-existent. It has been approved to dismiss the matter." Special delivery

### Xiong Shihui Discusses the Current Situation in the Northeast in His Hometown of Jiangxi Province

— Nanchang Air Mail, February 20th, by our reporter Liu Zao

Director Xiong Tianyi, taking advantage of his trip from the Northeast to Beijing to report on his work, returned to his ancestral home in Jiangxi to sweep the tombs. In order to accept the sincere welcome from the elders of Jiangxi whom he had bid farewell to for several years, he participated in many public welcome meetings, banquets, and met with friends from all sides. The day before yesterday, he reported on the general situation in the Northeast at the Provincial Government's Memorial Week. Although this information has been seen in newspapers, it is still considered the first relatively detailed public talk by someone who is in charge of the actual work in the Northeast.

Mr. Xiong first talked about Japan's governance of the Northeast. He said: "Japan ruled the Northeast for fourteen years. Its consistent policy was to Japanize the Northeast. Therefore, all facilities were built in accordance with this policy. In the military aspect, they naturally stepped up vigilance against the Soviet Union, paid close attention to maintaining security. The "Red Beard" bandits with history in the Northeast also dared not come out and move around in the important areas under Japanese rule. For the people who surrendered, they absolutely guaranteed the safety of their lives. In the political aspect, all the methods adopted were to facilitate control. At most, the Northeast was divided into twenty-one provinces, and later changed to fourteen provinces. The regions varied in size, and the government organizations each had their corresponding establishments. The administrative officials were absolutely guaranteed, and their salaries were all paid by the central government. The village and town Baojia organizations were quite sound.

Talking about the process of receiving the Northeast, he traced a foreign affairs story about the Northeast. He first explained: The Cairo Conference the year before last had a statement that the Northeast should be returned to China. Before Japan surrendered, the government had sent brothers to the Soviet Union to negotiate the issue of jointly fighting against Japan. Coincidentally, Japan announced its surrender in August of the same year. At that time, Foreign Minister Wang signed the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance, and the Soviet Union reiterated its respect for China's sovereignty in the Northeast. After the brothers returned to Chongqing, they were sent to the Northeast to be responsible for handling the work of receiving it. He divided this difficult and arduous task into four stages: (1) the diplomatic reception stage. (2) the military reception stage. (3) the political reception stage. (4) the military and political reception stage. Now it is a stage where the reception work is stagnant. In the diplomatic reception stage, it ended due to various difficulties in negotiations. In the military reception stage, our side used military force to retake important towns such as Jinzhou, Siping, and Changchun from the Communist army. In the political reception stage, there was no progress due to the Communist Party's lack of sincerity in negotiations. Currently, because the military is subject to the restrictions of the ceasefire agreement, and political negotiations are mostly shelved, the reception work has temporarily stopped. Our army has considerable strength in the Northeast and has an absolute overwhelming advantage over the Communist army. The Soviet Union is also very friendly to us. Whether the Northeast can be fully received in the future remains to be seen by the decisions of our central government.

Regarding the current situation in the Northeast, according to Mr. Xiong, the provinces that have been received are gradually getting on track. From a military point of view, in addition to the national army stationed in various important locations and temporarily adopting a defensive posture, they are working hard to establish security teams in various provinces and counties, giving them strict training, and striving to tighten the organization of the people in order to curb the wandering of bandits. Politically, the provincial and county organizations have restored the various establishments stipulated by the central government since December last year, and have smoothly implemented government orders in the four provinces of Jilin, Liaobei, Liaoning, and Andong. Financial tax revenue will be collected starting this year, with two dou of sorghum per yuan. It is believed that in the future, the finances of the provinces and counties in the Northeast will not be in dire straits. At the same time, training institutions are established to train political cadres at all levels. Economically, there are about three parts to the reception: (1) factory and mining assets. (2) materials. (3) real estate. Most of the above three items have been received, and transportation has been largely restored. In terms of education, the higher education institutions that have been restored include Northeast University, Changchun University, Changchun Normal College, and Shenyang Medical College. All primary and secondary schools have also resumed classes, but many teachers are not qualified, and efforts are being made to train a large number of excellent teachers to meet current needs.

Finally, Mr. Xiong put forward some opinions on the relationship between the Northeast and Jiangxi: (1) China must embark on industrialization. Jiangxi is now implementing a five-year construction plan, and its focus is also on developing industry. Although the industrial equipment in the Northeast has been damaged by the Communist Party and a part has been moved away by the Soviet Union, there is still a scale left. Jiangxi should cultivate industrial and technical talents and can directly send outstanding industrial newcomers to the Northeast factories for practice. (3) Products from the Northeast industry can be used by Jiangxi, and Jiangxi's special products, such as tea, are also urgently needed in the Northeast, so they can be circulated with each other. (3) In the past, during the enemy's "Manchukuo" rule in the Northeast, there were also some political advantages, such as: (1) The county magistrate paid close attention to the people's lives, such as security and hygiene, and handled them very seriously. (2) The principle of giving first and then taking was mostly used for taxing the people. They must first assist the people in production and increase production. (3) Developing public undertakings to enrich financial income, etc., are all sufficient for us to adopt and implement.

### Beautiful Mountain City

— Wang Pingling

In the summer of the second year of the War of Resistance, when I drifted from Hankou to Chongqing, I wrote a newsletter in the journal of the Chinese Writers' Association, wanting to tell the writers who were stranded in Hankou not to regard Shu as a dangerous path. I deliberately put forward a tempting topic——Beautiful Mountain City, doing my best to praise it. At that time, I also felt it was a bit too much. Today, when I occasionally flip through the old manuscripts, I feel it's not enough, I still have to continue the topic from eight years ago——Beautiful Mountain City, and continue writing.

Who can deny that this mountain city surrounded by the Jialing River and the Yangtze River is a lighthouse in the storm, a command post for the War of Resistance, and is equally important, or even more important, than Washington, London, and Kuibyshev! Within the scope extended by the old city walls, although it has not been conveniently carved into a natural garden, as long as you step out of the suburbs or cross the river to Jiangbei and the South Bank, no matter which mountain, rock, hot spring, or historical site, if moved to Jiangnan, it will definitely be praised and sung by poets and writers, and be amazed as a miracle of the world. I remember that my brother Hu Feng also wrote an article about his impressions of the mountain city in the "Front Line" of the Ta Kung Pao. But he couldn't see where the beauty of the mountain city lay, as if I had deceived him. After the victory, he flew to Shanghai long ago. When he recalls the mountain city and writes another article about his impressions of the mountain city, maybe his views will be different from before.

During the war, the mountain city was crowded with all kinds of people. Some people from Jiangnan, who were chased by the Japanese invaders and had to come here to take refuge, often boasted that Jiangnan was good, Jiangnan was better than the rugged Shu. When the beautiful days of spring and autumn come, when the red apricot blossoms bloom and the green willow birds sing, you can sail the Huafang of West Lake, appreciate the plum blossoms of Dengwei, pick the green celery of Xuanwu, and step on the red leaves of Qixia. Jiangnan lingers in the dreams of the people of Jiangnan. It's been eight years. Now that I've heard the firecrackers celebrating victory, why not return! My home is also by the side of Jiangyu Taihu Lake, not on the Songhua River in the Northeast, but I still miss the beautiful mountain city.

Beautiful Mountain City! Under your protection, the Chinese nation has passed the final crisis. I don't know how many heroic fighters, generous heroes, and righteous people who sacrificed their families to help the country wrote bloody epics. But there were also countless demons who spread plagues and created evils here, making you unclean. Today, you seem more peaceful and beautiful!

People all like to "compete for fame in the court, and compete for profit in the market," how is this different from cattle and sheep choosing water and grass to live on? My hometown has now become a den of fame and fortune. I am afraid to see the faces of those who compete for fame and fortune. I am also worried that the insects that are trampled on will be crushed to pieces under their feet. This New Year, I received letters from friends in Jiangnan thousands of miles away, inquiring about my return date. That piece of touching affection can even tease my reverie; but looking eastward, I don't know what era it is in the world. Let's just watch this phenomenon that is evolving in the high mountain city!

Alas! The years urge people to grow old and tender, and the heroic spirit of going forward courageously has been exhausted in the eight long years of war and one and a half years of peaceful hardship! Seeing the competitive people in the long years, flying north to Yan, going south to Wu, or sightseeing in the "upper country" and lecturing in "that beauty", not hesitating to abandon the rest of their lives of suffering, and immersing themselves in the vast sea of people, bare-chested and fighting, swimming desperately to catch the resources of survival, I can only admire their "fighting spirit", and feel ashamed that I am a defeated coward in the battlefield of life! But there are also some strong and young men who claim to be heroes of copper muscles and iron bones, and who return without being late in life, and whose "fighting spirit" does not lag behind, and who repeatedly write letters, painfully recounting their encounters, sobbing and weeping, unable to control themselves, almost having the feeling of "there is no door in the sky, and no way to enter the earth", then, how can a lonely and helpless person like me not be discouraged! Fortunately, today's mountain city is not so bad. Most people have not lost the sympathy that should exist between people. Everyone does not adopt the vicious intention of "harming others to benefit oneself". They still tell the truth, rely on their conscience, and act with integrity. On the night of the Lantern Festival, they can still watch the lion and dragon lanterns running and jumping with a carefree smile on their faces. Even if there are a few people who don't know what to do and want to use the opportunity of having a lot of people on the street to carry out anti-whatever propaganda, even if they speak until their tongues are broken and their breath is not connected, it seems that it is far less attractive than a paper-paste dragon lantern or a lifelike lion, running and jumping on the street!

The early spring in the mountain city is protected by the mountains, and the Siberian cold current, even if it has flowed through the Hetao area, affecting Tianjin and gradually approaching the Central Plains, will not visit the mountain city. There is also a "Tung Flower Cold" in February here, but it is not as uncomfortable as the spring cold in Jiangnan. Strange, "fog season" is already a habitual term. In winter, there is always a bright big sun, like a natural stove, warming the mountain city and warming everyone's body. The people who live here, their hearts will not be so cold that they freeze, I think it has something to do with the early appearance of the sun. In spring, the fields are full of green, and the bean seedlings are full of countless fluttering butterflies, as if swaying in the dance hall of the Paramount. The streets selling flowers are full of flowers, all kinds of flowers. Nature has tried to use the skills of a barber to arrange the young wheat on the ridges extremely evenly, and in the gentle spring breeze, they rise up with amorous ripples like the soft hair of girls. In Nanshan, which is full of romantic history and has been the site of many love-struck men and women duels, love killings, and love nests, the pine breeze roars like waves, and wild flowers bloom in unison. The birds have already started their singing concerts in the forest. The tea trees growing in the secluded valleys are also blooming. The farmers are picking new buds, drying them, and brewing them with boiling spring water, which is no less than the Dragon Well of West Lake. In my spare time during the New Year, I have often sailed with two or three close friends on the small stream of Nanquan. The new rain accumulated on both sides flows to the stream and river, turning into white silver chains, like thousands of dragons and snakes swimming. Returning from Nanquan, having cleansed my body and mind, and reduced the burden on my shoulders, I feel as if I am riding the wind, and I really don't know if there are any worries in the world, and I feel like I am about to become an immortal. The mountain city is beautiful; but only those of us who are unencumbered, uncontested, and unseeking can appreciate its beauty.

Here, I am afraid to hear the news coming from Jiangnan. Every piece of news is heart-shattering. We are floating water crows, and at night, we are all looking for our own homes by the Yangtze River. This river is like a long snake. You are at the "head of Wu", and we are at the "tail of Chu". Although there is a distance, it does not exceed the length of the snake's body. The head of Wu and the tail of Chu are closely related. I cannot forget Jiangnan, just as I care about my friends living in Jiangnan.

Spring is coming, and spring brings hope and happiness to people. Here, I respectfully pray for my friends, may you be broad-minded and optimistic, and seek your own good fortune. How much is life, like morning dew, why bother to compete with each other bitterly? God in Heaven, as if foreseeing that mankind will always have a tragic ending, specially laid out a piece of brocade in the spring of every year for people to admire. May everyone cherish the good spring scenery and not live up to the generosity of nature.

### Mother's Trip

— Translated by Chen Yin

A fussy mother took five children on a train and kept asking the porter to take care of her children along the way.

As the trip was about to end, she asked the porter to hold the smallest one, who was crying desperately, while she took care of the other children. At this time, the porter was really a little impatient.

"Madam," the porter said, "I think when you come out to travel, you should leave half of your children at home."

The woman looked at him proudly and said, "That's what I did."

### Eulogy for Supervisor Qian Jingyu

— Zhi Xiu

No such talent in Yue, the debate in Shanghai is most worthy of thought; in youth I remember urging you to open the book, in old age I met you and allowed you to talk about poetry. I regret missing the literary gathering on the Lantern Festival, and I am shocked by the fading appearance of a hundred years; now tears pour down like the East Sea, washing away the unknown of the catalpa coffin!

### British Literary Miscellany

— Zhao Jingshen

Liam O’Flaherty, who was introduced and whose novels were translated by Yu Dafu, has recently published a new novel, "Land." This novel is quite close to farce, the story is lively and powerful.

Miss V. Sackville-West has recently published a collection of poems, "The Garden," which is poetic.

Last year, The House of Hutchinson published "Shaw at Ninety," a collective work with contributions from Sir Max Beerbohm, Lord Dunsany, L. Housman, Xiong Shiyi, Aldous Huxley, J. Masfield, H.G. Wells, and others. Wells had not yet passed away at that time. The book includes color illustrations, mostly from Shaw's own collection.

Miss Laura L. Hinkley of the United States received the California Literature Gold Medal for her book on past British female writers, "Charlotte and Emnlly, The Brontes," discussing their "Jane Eyre" and "Wuthering Heights." The latter was adapted into a play called "Endless Sorrow" by Ms. Zhao Qingge. The same author also wrote "Ladies of Literature," discussing many British female writers such as Austen, the Brontë sisters, Mrs. Browning, and Eliot.

Jamess Barke plans three novels about Robert Burns. This Scottish poet will be further revealed through Barke's narrative. In addition to knowing him as a farmer poet, we can also learn about his ancestors, the situation in 18th-century Scotland, and Burns's youth. Burns's father worked tirelessly, and the village teacher introduced literary works to Burns. His mother sang sweet folk songs to him, and old Betty Daoidson also told him stories and ballads, providing him with rich material. "The sweet tongue of the Scots flows with honey." All of this is recorded in the first volume of Barke's trilogy, "The Wind that Shakes the Barley."

### Blessing

— Saint

——Written for a friend going to study in the United States

Throughout the long years of your life, although you have always lived a blissful petit bourgeois life, you are your parents' darling, the pride of the whole family; however, you certainly do not have the arrogance of a pampered young lady, nor have you picked up the bad habits of urban misses who are extravagant and frivolous. With this alone, you can be proud in front of millions of people. At the same time, the only manifestation of this pride is that today you are determined to temporarily abandon the blissful family life and resolutely embark on a journey across the ocean to seek further education. For your future, and to cultivate another talent for the country! I specially write this article to bless your future success.

Once, one evening, you told me many unexpected experiences, which made it impossible for me to describe my respect for you at that time; until now, it is still deeply imprinted in my heart, leaving behind eternal memories. Six years ago, just as the Pacific War broke out and the enemy entered the concession, you, only sixteen years old, disregarded everything and single-handedly threw yourself into the embrace of the motherland—going to Jinhua. This extraordinary spirit demonstrates your courage, a courage that not only is not possessed by girls in the same family environment as you, but even an ordinary boy would not easily do such a risky thing. Precisely because you are a girl, it shows your unparalleled tenacity. Therefore, today you can give up a life of pleasure and go to the United States, seeking loneliness and a monotonous atmosphere among strangers. I believe in your determination, I admire your perseverance. To encourage you and to increase your courage, I bless you with a boundless future and a bright path.

Now, the motherland is engulfed in flames of war, and the gospel of peace is so渺茫. In this city filled with the atmosphere of metallic vulgarity, an ordinary college student is not surprising. There is no place for you in society, nor the ideal environment you are pursuing. You are like a drop in the ocean, drifting with the waves, not knowing when you may be sunk by a giant wave. Therefore, you are a reject of society. In order to escape reality, you are keenly leaving this society; in a blink of an eye, you will leave the motherland, leave this bustling city, and cross the ocean alone to another new world, breathing that healthy air. I bless you a smooth journey, to return to the country after completing your studies as soon as possible, and to create a new world for you and for the motherland.

When you return, I hope that the motherland will no longer hear the sound of gunfire, nor smell the smell of gunpowder. The whole of China will be a peaceful paradise. I will wait for your return in front of the garden in paradise, waiting for you to play the symphony of peace. I bless you. I devoutly kneel before the Vatican and silently wish you success, blessing you to bring new seeds and new nourishment to cultivate your new life, your new future, and also to cultivate a new China.

### Cultural Exchange Among the People

— Hua Lin

In ancient times, political and military achievements paved the way for cultural transmission. For example, Alexander the Great of Greece conquered India, but Hellenism also declined. Napoleon invaded Moscow, but French culture became bleak. It can be seen that trying to oppress other people's lands and destroy other people's cultural relics with politics and force will only result in one's own national power declining, leaving behind some exaggerated forms for later generations to mourn. Only cultural exchange among the people and mutual assistance between people can eliminate the boundaries between different races and resolve international misunderstandings. Therefore, the League of Nations initially established a cultural cooperation organization, selecting social elites from various countries who did not represent their countries. The intention was to promote mutual friendship and assistance between people, promote mutual understanding, and reduce misunderstandings. Without political power, allowing cultural exchange can give hope for world peace and progress.

Now, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) has changed its previous methods, with countries sending designated representatives to participate. Naturally, many cooperative effects can also be achieved, such as establishing nutrition center stations and literacy campaigns to eliminate illiteracy, all kinds of plans to seek welfare for mankind. But the power of mutual understanding and enthusiasm for mutual assistance are far less direct and profound than cultural exchange among the people. To help promote this kind of world cooperation movement, it is still necessary for social elites, academic experts, and people of high moral character to come forward to preside over and lead. Only when people and people are united firmly can progress be made. Zhang Boling returned from the United States, full of hope for China's rejuvenation. When asked what he would do in the future, he said that in addition to education work, he would also devote himself to the Sino-American Cultural Association. He earnestly said that cultural exchange among the people is more important than political diplomacy. This is indeed a visionary insight. In the future, the world may walk on this bright path to peace. A true cultural renaissance must be found through cooperation among the people of all countries to find what is fair and just. Today, in China, where the economy is chaotic and academia is barren, in addition to popularizing education and developing industry, we should especially pay attention to friendship and mutual assistance among the people.

### An Inch of Land, An Inch of Blood 178

— Ye Jingfeng

What is Pingzi's intention in revealing this information!? Yaoqun glanced at a few of us, stopping at Tsurumi's face, as if searching for some secret that Tsurumi had not revealed: "She and you..."?

Hearing Yaoqun's seemingly unfinished question, I, as a third party, suddenly felt like I had been electrocuted, and the blood vessels on my temples throbbed a little. The relationship between the three of them—Tsurumi, Yaoqun, and Pingzi—from beginning to end, only I knew most clearly.

People who are overly sensitive will definitely say when they see me writing the story here that the author must be pulling these one man and two women together to create a "love triangle" story that is popular now, to make the scene more lively. I am temporarily unwilling to express any opinions on such views, I only worry that people who look at this record with such eyes may feel even more disappointed in the future!

When I heard Yaoqun ask Tsurumi, I felt some surprise at the time, which was a kind of inexplicable unease for the straightforwardness of this northeastern girl Yaoqun and Tsurumi's awkwardness, without any other thoughts.

"Pingzi and I:" Tsurumi replied, "Now we maintain a delicate facade that is neither enemy nor friend. However, it cannot be said to be an 'enemy,' nor can it be said to be a 'friend.' In the face of the great era and great changes that are about to unfold before us, I can boldly say a word—the two words 'man' and 'woman' cannot, and should not, continue to carry the kind of 'sexual' characteristics in the eyes of ordinary society—this is because we are all fighters, and each person is a unit of a fighter. To put it more concretely, those with different goals must fight each other, and those with the same interests must work together, regardless of whether the other party is male or female. This is an iron law; an iron law generated in response to this great era!" Tsurumi's expression showed innocence, frankness, and sincerity.

"You misunderstood, Mr. Gu!" Yaoqun chuckled. "I remember I said this theory before you, remember?: What I want to understand now is whether Pingzi-san, this 'unit of a fighter,' has the same 'interests' as you, or the opposite, or seemingly the same but seemingly the opposite? On this point, do you have any solid certainty? Because I am worried about you now...worried about you, which is also worried about our group..."

Tsurumi was really embarrassed. People who are not very understanding may commit suicide by jumping into the river, hanging themselves, taking sleeping pills, or firing a shot at their temples or heart, or Japanese-style seppuku, jumping into a volcano; or Western-style cutting their veins, releasing gas, jumping from the thirteenth floor, swallowing potassium cyanide. How can one's good intentions be misinterpreted as a relationship between a man and a woman? And then give a long lecture?

I seemed to have to help Tsurumi out of this predicament, but at that time, a kind of indescribable insight flashed like lightning, which actually stopped me from speaking out. The rest included Little Huchen, who couldn't say a clever word to ease this low-pressure situation. Unfortunately, he didn't grasp the core of the sexual issue at all, and many theoretical professional terms made him dizzy. For example, the two words "fighter," in his half-knowledge, should probably be "gan shi," and "a unit of a fighter" should happily say "a ganzi," and so on. He sat here listening to us talk, like a country child listening to a group of fashionable college students discussing love issues, with how many unsuitable English words in a Chinese sentence. That would naturally make this country child confused. Therefore, Huchen was in such a "qie men" environment, not to mention that he couldn't say a clever word, even breathing was a little uncomfortable.

### Art Scene

The inaugural issue of the literary monthly "Ren Shi Jian," edited by Feng Zi, will be published soon.

Luo Bingji went to the countryside a few days ago for a short stay, engaged in creating a long novel.

"A River of Spring Flows Eastward," co-directed by Cai Chusheng and Zheng Junli, has been filmed since it started, and nearly two-fifths of the upper part of the film, "Eight Years of Separation," has been completed.

Chen Baichen recently wrote a screenplay for "Lianhua," and it is said that the manuscript will be completed soon.

Hong Shen is about to go to Wuxi to direct "Liren Xing" for the Drama Nine Team, and to teach theater theory to the comrades of the team.

"Spring Dream in Paradise," directed by Tang Xiaodan, went to the Rong Family Garden on Hongqiao Road yesterday to shoot exterior scenes. One day's work yielded only the first scene. It is said that after Tang Xiaodan finishes filming this film, he will go to Beiping to direct a film for China Electric Factory No. 3.

It is rumored that Fei Mu intends to revive "Shangyi" and will return to "Carlton."

"Returning Home in Glory," directed by Zhao Dan, is being rushed to film and will be completed within the month.

Xu Zhiqiao, the editor of the wartime Guilin-published "Drama Chunqiu" monthly, recently came to Shanghai from Wuxi.

The news that Guanghua's "Ten Thousand Taels of Gold" will be followed by "Nepotism" after the 16th is not accurate. Only the role of Han Fei will be replaced by Sun Zhijun, as Han Fei will soon participate in the China Drama Society's performance of "True and False Aunt."

Bai Mu received a letter from home and was very happy, but when he opened it, he cried non-stop because the letter reported the death of his parents. Therefore, Bai Mu has recently been wearing black cloth on his lapel and is depressed.

Pei Lin's new film in China Electric Factory No. 2 has been set as "Green Grass by the River," and it is said that the story is adapted from "Waterloo Bridge."

The preview performance held at the Tianchan Stage on the eve of the Drama Festival had a large number of programs, and all attendees felt a sense of fatigue bombing, but they all patiently waited for the unprecedented "North-South Harmony" grand finale play "Hitting the Fishing Family," because this was a once-in-a-century event.

### Flower Market

— Lu Shan

A Discussion of Nurseries, Flower Sheds, and the Flower Season

(1) Spring Arrives in the World

It's spring, but Shanghai is still shivering in the cold wind. — In this world-class metropolis, spring flowers will soon bloom on the chests of noble ladies; bloom in the magnificent street-side glass display windows; and be displayed in quiet studies. These brilliant, colorful flowers can prove that the winter in spring — this chilly winter wind — will not linger for too long.

Because those fragrant, sweet-smelling, and colorful flowers will soon wave and call the real spring to come. If you don't believe it, in the nurseries and glass sheds, all kinds of flowers have already sent out buds and sprouted green shoots, which will reveal their most moving colors and scents to express how moving the youthful appearance is.

(2) Artificial Cultivation

Shanghai, all year round — regardless of spring, summer, autumn, or winter, for twelve months, fresh flowers never stop.

These flowers, whether it is autumn frost or dew, or white snow and ice, the most brightly colored flowers still bloom all over Shanghai, in the vases of dressing tables, and in magnificent living rooms. Most of these flowers are cultivated artificially, forced to bloom after a long period of smoking by florists in glass greenhouses.

Those carnations and lilies used for weddings, can't they be pinned on the chests of beautiful brides all year round? If it weren't for artificial cultivation, how could they have such a long lifespan?

(3) Flower Market Association

Most of Shanghai's flower markets are concentrated in Xieqiao in the Nanshi area, where there is a Flower Market Association. All the flowers from flower sheds throughout Shanghai are sent to the flower market in the middle of the night. The flower market's trading time is from 3:00 to 5:00 AM. Flower sellers and flower buyers all trade during this time. After this time, the flower market closes, and you have to wait until the next day.

The Flower Market Association also provides places to stay. Sellers from distant flower sheds can bring their flowers early and stay at the Flower Market Association. At a certain time, you can sell your flowers, and the association only charges a small fee.

(4) Flower Shed Areas

It is impossible to count all the flower sheds in Shanghai for the time being. Their distribution locations are roughly in Pudong, Nanshi, and Caohejing. The construction cost of a flower shed is estimated to be about four million yuan now, including glass and steam. Now, because it is not profitable to grow rice in the fields, having a glass flower shed is much more profitable.

Before every "Qingming Festival," all the fresh flowers in Shanghai are cultivated in glass sheds using high-temperature steam.

Those bright red and white carnations, yellow and purplish red roses, foreign willows, and lotus flowers that you often see on the streets... most of these are foreign varieties, and they are all illegally produced in artificial glass sheds. But aren't they just as dazzling and beautiful?

(5) Flower Season

The market price of flowers also changes with the seasons. For example, these past few days, the weather has been terribly cold, and the market price of flowers has increased by one-third. A dozen carnations sell for 12,000, and foreign willows sell for 7,000 or 8,000, 4,000 or 5,000 per bunch, and lilies sell for 120,000 a dozen...

If you have any banquet, as long as it meets the needs, you will never be stingy about buying some flowers to decorate it.

But if the weather really warms up, after the "Qingming Festival," when open-air flowers are on the market, those natural flowers that are not cultivated in glass sheds, when they really bloom all over the world, the prices of those artificially cultivated flowers will immediately fall.

That's when fresh flowers are truly democratized. You and I, who do not belong to the aristocratic class, can also decorate our vases with red and green.

Isn't that so? The real spring, that's when it truly arrives in the world.

### Talking About Long and Short Couplets — New Words on Couplets — Two —

— Listening to Pine Trees

Yesterday, I wrote a couplet by Zhang Wenxiang. At the same time, Shen Meisou also mentioned a couplet: "When Chang Hubei created the Silver Yuan Bureau, Nanpi intended to write a long couplet outside the gate of the bureau, but he did not write it for a long time. The officials said that the bureau was about to be completed and needed to be applied urgently. Wenxiang had no choice but to order his staff to write it, but the draft was not satisfactory. One day, while hosting a banquet, he suddenly ordered the talents to quickly buy two wide red papers and write a couplet on the spot, saying: 'The state of Chu regarded it as a treasure, and nothing is better than the dragon for heaven.' The first line is an idiom, embedding the characters for 'state' and 'treasure', which is already rare and valuable. The second line quotes a sentence from Zhuangzi, which is accurate to the dragon round, and is even more complete and natural, and cleverly insurmountable." Meisou said: When he picked up the pen and wrote quickly, he looked around and said: If anyone can change a word in this couplet hanging on the bureau gate, I will also reward them with a thousand gold. His bold and unrestrained enthusiasm was unparalleled in the world. Now, more than ten years have passed, but it is still like yesterday. What is even more difficult is that the words are calm and composed, and the use of idioms is humorous and wonderful, which is even more unprecedented. My late father said: "Writing fearful couplets has flexibility, and writing short couplets, whether five-character or seven- or eight-character, is not easy to quote idioms. Even if you write your own, in a few words, there is a historical fact and ambition. Not only must it be all-encompassing, but also accurate and unchangeable. The identity and tone must be exactly as they should be, and the difficulty is really twice as difficult as writing a long couplet." Weng Changshu was also good at making couplets, and his door couplet, "Old steeds think of thousands of miles, wrens perch on a branch," which also used idioms, was also widely recited for a time. This old man was the same year as my late father, and their friendship was very deep. My late father's seventieth birthday, the seven-character couplet he gave said: "Yellow-haired old officials are the same as the nine old men, white-haired and young are like infants." The first line refers to Zhang Xiangshi's late Wen Duan Gong being seventy years old and attending the Jiu Lao Banquet. The second line is because my late father and late grandmother were born on the same day. Whenever this day came, he would always cry several times, unable to bear the banquet celebration. Changshu knew this situation very well, but the seventieth birthday could not be celebrated behind closed doors, so the wording of the second line completely covered this matter, which was more accurate than the first line, and the tone was great, and it also suited each other's identity. It was written on Qianlong imitation, Dengxin Hall warehouse yellow stationery, which can be said to be a masterpiece of words.

### Dialogue of Love

— Kong Yuan

"Plato said, thank God, I am a man and not a woman. This sentence is clearly insulting to us women."

"Not at all. Plato hoped to become a strong person, because people often said: Weak person, your name is woman."

"Why did Kant never marry in his life? Did he advocate celibacy?"

"He wanted to get married very much. He wanted to propose to his girlfriend twice, but his hesitation and hesitation were the cause of his trouble. Once, he hesitated for too long. She couldn't wait for his decision and moved elsewhere. Once, he hesitated and couldn't decide, and she finally loved a man with courage."

"Do you advocate that a man should propose to his girlfriend quickly?"

"The word 'quickly' in your sentence is problematic. My advocacy is that you can't choose the person you want to love quickly. When you really choose, then you might as well tell her quickly that you love her."

### Collection of Wind and Rain

— Li Shui

A streetcar ticket seller asked another companion, he said: "Government employees are allocated in-kind benefits, do we count as government employees?"

Passengers and ticket sellers in streetcars and buses often scold each other loudly. One says: "Big shot, take the bus!" The other says: "At most, it's just a ticket seller, what's there to be proud of?" In fact, "we are all wanderers fallen from the ends of the earth," why bother pressing each other so hard?

Just after the spring break, children reach out to ask their parents for money to go to school. For parents, planning for school and meal expenses of four or five hundred thousand or a million has already made them add a few strands of "white hair." Have the children ever thought that in each of these bundles of paper money, there are so many worries and sorrows!

Since the introduction of transfer fees for houses, people who have no houses to live in have already regarded houses as half the sky. Now, after such a turbulent financial tide, houses have become vague clouds and fog, even more distant and impossible to grasp.

The threat of life makes everyone have a feeling of "melancholy." Living in these turbulent years, how should we deal with this rapidly changing space, it seems that we ourselves have lost the ability to control.

### Introducing "A Tree Grows in Brooklyn"

— Guo Hua

"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn," which is about to be released at the Cathay Theatre, is a best-selling novel published in 1943. The author is Betty Smith, originally named A Tree Grows in Brooklyn. Translating it as "Chang Chun Shu" (Evergreen Tree) is really very appropriate to the content. The story is about the Nolans, a family in a slum in Brooklyn. Although this family (especially the father and daughter) is in a difficult situation, they still do not lose their hope, just like that tree in a dirty backyard, it can pierce the cement and grow into the air.

The director of "A Tree Grows in Brooklyn" is Elia Kazan. The leading actors are Peggy Ann Garner as Francie (daughter), Dorothy McGuire as Katie (mother), and James Dunn as Johnny (father). Life magazine introduced it as a best-selling novel made into a wonderful movie, worth watching.

Movie Talk

### "Each Has Their Own Merits"

— Luo Lin

After the victory, domestic films are seeking new paths. In terms of subject matter, there are quite a few films based on stories from the war-time occupied areas, such as "Family of Loyalty and Righteousness," "Iron Will and Ice Heart," "Sugarcane Flowers Turn White, Swallows Fly," and the recent "Madame in Distress." However, because each film more or less committed the fault of conceptual depiction, the audience did not feel intimate with them. "Each Has Their Own Merits" took a different approach, becoming a portrayal of daily life, expressing the distance in thinking between mother and daughter through interesting details in life, and the disputes in the small family life after the daughter's marriage, etc.

The playwright wanted to place the theme on the so-called issue of women's education, but he could not make the decision himself. His pen had to touch on this turbulent reality, depicting the various sufferings people endure in real life. However, he did not unite the two; women's education, women's status in society, their professions and economic foundation, these issues are all raised, but we don't know at all what the playwright's subjective views are. He seems to be taking us around in circles. At the end of the film, the young couple Jin Bihua and Yang Cong, due to the difficulties of economic life, their fantasies are shattered. They have to endure a period of darkness before they can wait for the dawn. They still expect to live a comfortable life. This is a very weak ending. Jin Bihua and Yang Cong suffered some hardships and hit many snags, finally jumping out of a void and ethereal fantasy. Could it be that they are going to be made to dream an unrealistic dream again? I say, unlimited tears, of course, also have brilliance, but they more often express pessimism, disappointment, rather than being positive or striving.

From the perspective of theme expression, "Each Has Their Own Merits" also lacks completeness. However, the events in the story are familiar to us. On this point alone, it will be able to gain something. Director Zhu Shilin showed his unique talent in many fragments. Jin Bihua visited four past classmates after her marriage, inserting four fragments of depiction, without repetition, and also letting us open our eyes to see other family lives. From a holistic perspective, Zhu Shilin was also able to use economical conditions to make films and cover up the hasty places well.
