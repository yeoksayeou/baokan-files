### External Adoption of Various Opinions in Preparation for the Draft Treaty of Peace with Japan; Wang Shijie to Leave New York Today for Tokyo

[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 19th] The political, economic, and diplomatic subcommittees of the External Review Committee for the Treaty of Peace with Japan have been meeting almost daily for the past week. The opinions of relevant agencies, experts, and public opinion are deeply valued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and have been largely adopted. For example, Premier Zhang Qun's proposal to recover Ryukyu, as reported to the Resident Commissioners of the Political Council on the 18th, was a solemn decision made after consulting various parties. The deliberations of the Review Committee have covered all possible issues. It is expected that the draft Treaty of Peace with Japan, prepared by our country, will be as perfect as possible, supported by the people, and valued by the Allied nations.

[Central News Agency, Chenggong Lake, 18th, United Press] Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Shijie is scheduled to take a flight from New York via Tokyo to return to Nanjing at 4 p.m. on the 20th. Chinese sources only said that official duties in Nanjing were busy and required Mr. Wang to handle them, but declined to elaborate.

[United Press, New York, 19th] The most well-informed sources here believe that the hope of convening a preliminary conference on the Treaty of Peace with Japan before the beginning of 1948 has been dashed. As a result of Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Shijie's repeated talks with U.S. officials over the past two weeks, China's opposition to the U.S. position on voting procedures may be overcome in the coming weeks. It is reported that China has obtained assurances from the United States that U.S. regulations after the signing of the treaty will not harm China, but China cannot change the U.S. position that Japan should be allowed to have a permanent economic standard equivalent to that of 1930-1934. The opinions of China and the United States on the total tonnage of merchant ships that Japan should have differ greatly. There is no hope of reaching a compromise on this matter before the formal holding of the conference. At the same time, some here believe that when the four powers meet in London on November 25, the United States will use this opportunity to once again persuade the Soviet Union to participate in the conference. However, if the Soviet Union continues to refuse, the United States will proceed with the convening procedure when China expresses its willingness to participate.

### Our Commercial Representative Speaks: Japan Should Revise its Trade Policy Toward China

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 18th] Tang Jiusheng, the Chinese government's commercial representative, stated: Unless Japan revises its trade policy toward China, barter trade between our country and Japan will be impossible. If Japan reverts to its pre-war policy of dumping cheap and unnecessary goods into our country's markets, it will destroy any possibility of establishing friendly commercial relations between the two countries. Mr. Tang, who arrived here last week, emphasized that future Japanese exports to our country should be limited to machinery and tools and other items, as such exports will help our country build its production capacity and contribute to the recovery of our national economy. Mr. Tang suggested that industrialists and traders in our country should formulate countermeasures for the mutual exchange of raw materials and finished products between China and Japan to guide the re-establishment of commercial relations between the two countries. Currently, trade between the two countries is hampered by the lack of U.S. dollars in both countries. Our country has already exhausted the amount of foreign exchange used for imports. Mr. Tang revealed that there are no U.S. dollar deposits available to purchase Japanese goods until our country announces the amount of foreign exchange to be used for imports in the next season. Mr. Tang also pointed out technical difficulties, such as trade and currency exchange formats, payment methods, and other obstacles to trade between the two countries. Unless these obstacles are removed, private traders in our country will not be able to come to Japan to conduct sales or purchases.

### The Question of Recovering Hong Kong Can Be Resolved Reasonably; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Replies to Inquiries from Senators

[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 19th] Regarding the question of recovering Hong Kong, senators previously raised inquiries with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has recently replied, stating that after the further strengthening of Sino-British relations, the Hong Kong issue can be resolved reasonably. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs believes that Sino-British relations have become increasingly friendly over the past year or so, and the British government has also paid close attention to the national aspirations of the people in British-controlled areas and will use this as a basis to change its past policies.

### The Macau Issue: To Be Raised in the Future

[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 19th] Regarding the issue of recovering Macau, our Ministry of Foreign Affairs had discussed it with the Portuguese side several times when China and Portugal negotiated the abolition of the unequal treaty. However, the Portuguese side has always insisted on not discussing it, and according to the Sino-Portuguese Treaty of 1887, Macau is "permanently managed" by Portugal with our permission, and its nature is different from that of a leased territory, almost equivalent to a ceded territory. In view of this, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs believes that this matter should not be left pending for a long time, otherwise it will delay the abolition of Portuguese consular jurisdiction in China. Therefore, it has first signed an exchange of notes with the Portuguese side to abolish the above-mentioned privileges, in the hope that when negotiating a treaty in the future, we can still raise the Macau issue and seek to adjust general relations. Our negotiations to purchase aircraft from Canada have been completed and delivery methods have also been decided.

[United Press, Ottawa, 18th] Canadian newspapers reported today that the Chinese government's negotiations to purchase approximately 150 Mosquito fighter-bombers from Canada have been completed, requiring a total payment of approximately 10 million to 12 million Canadian dollars. The procedure is as follows: China purchases aircraft from the War Assets Corporation for a price of 5 million U.S. dollars. The aircraft will be transferred by China to Havilland Aircraft Company in Toronto, and will be adjusted according to the contract, requiring an additional 5 million to 7 million U.S. dollars. Havilland Aircraft Company delivers the goods to China.

### Former Polish Ambassador to the United States Advocates Immediate Aid to China

[Central News Agency, San Francisco, 18th] Former Polish Ambassador to the United States, Tytus Filipowicz, recently stated in a speech to the Republican Club here that the United States should immediately provide China with its full "military, political, and economic" assistance. He said: "We must not let the misfortune of Poland be repeated in China. The time to help China is now." It is noted that Mr. Filipowicz is currently applying for U.S. citizenship.

[United Press, Manila, 19th] The Manila Chronicle reported in detail today that if the United States believes that China is currently capable of rectifying itself and therefore abandons its determination to help China, it will inevitably make a big mistake and regret it. The Soviet Union may take its place and succeed.

### The Timing of Currency Reform

In recent months, special prices have soared endlessly, the purchasing power of the legal currency has become increasingly low, and inflation seems to be approaching a malignant stage. As a result, the issue of currency reform has once again become the focus of discussion; everyone believes that currency reform is absolutely necessary, but opinions on when to reform the currency are still not unified. The theme of this article is to explain that currency reform has now become a matter of urgency. The earlier the reform, the more likely the currency system can be saved. The later the reform, the more unimaginable the economy may be. Please explain the reasons as follows:

According to the Central Bank's Financial Weekly, the special price index in China, in the week of September 29th to 14th, the Shanghai wholesale special price index has reached 4,903.121; in other words, it is more than 40,000 times that of the pre-war period (1937). Generally speaking, it can be said that prices have risen to 50,000 times (in fact, it may be more than this number). To know the extent of the current price and currency malignant inflation in China, it is best to compare it with the situation of the German mark in 1923. German paper marks have depreciated year by year since the outbreak of the Great War in 1914, and the situation is similar to that of the current legal currency in China. If calculated by the annual average, the number of paper marks equivalent to one gold mark (that is, the normal value of the mark) is as follows: It can be seen that the paper price of the mark is getting faster and faster. Take the end of each month in 1923 as an example, the paper marks for each gold mark are as follows:

Therefore, in fact, by October 1923, the paper mark had completely collapsed. If the current price in China is calculated at 50,000 times, then one yuan of legal currency before the war is approximately equivalent to 50,000 yuan of legal currency now, which is equivalent to the situation of the German paper mark in June and July 1923. If currency reform is not implemented as soon as possible, the collapse of the legal currency may become inevitable.

Some may think that the German government deliberately let the paper mark fall in those years, intending to eliminate it to eliminate its debts, while the Chinese government is still trying to maintain the legal currency, which seems not comparable. In fact, the depreciation of a currency has its natural trend. At a certain stage, its depreciation power is very large, and it is almost impossible to contain it. Therefore, regardless of whether it is intended to eliminate it or to maintain it, when the depreciation of a currency has reached 50,000 times, currency reform must be carried out as soon as possible to stop the malignant inflation from becoming more serious and to avoid economic collapse.

Some may think that the conditions for currency reform are not yet available, so the timing of currency reform is not yet ripe. But if the legal currency really collapses one day, will the conditions for currency reform be available? If it is not available by then, how will the government handle the aftermath? Others may think that there are three types of imbalances at present: first, the fiscal revenue and expenditure are unbalanced; second, the international balance of payments is unbalanced; and third, the production and consumption are unbalanced. As long as these three imbalances exist for one day, the currency system cannot be reformed for one day. In fact, this view is wrong, and unfortunately, this wrong view is mostly held by the current financial authorities. Because under the current continuous depreciation of the legal currency and continuous inflation, these three imbalances will only become more serious: first, the fiscal revenue and expenditure are unbalanced, which is already very serious, but if prices continue to soar, expenditures continue to increase, and inflation further expands, the vicious circle will become more and more intense, and the fiscal revenue and expenditure will only become more unbalanced! Because tax revenue will never catch up with prices (the reason is that tax revenue should not compete with prices, and it is impossible to catch up with prices in terms of time and technology), and public bonds cannot be issued, the result is only relying on inflation, and the vicious circle will only increase without end. Second, the imbalance of international balance of payments is also the result of inflation, not the reason why inflation cannot be contained. Under the current foreign exchange management system, hoping to receive more remittances from overseas Chinese and hoping to increase exports may have become completely useless, because the so-called listed market price and the black market must still have a considerable distance, and the so-called "absorption of overseas Chinese remittances" has proven to be a complete failure. As for increasing exports, in the situation that the domestic price level has long been higher than the world market level, how can we really find a way to increase exports? The so-called Foreign Exchange Balance Fund Committee only follows the black market's rise and has no ability to "balance" exchange rates! If the value of the legal currency continues to fall, even if the government uses all its might, we will only see the black market for gold and banknotes still soaring, and we may not be able to hope that the international balance of payments can tend to be balanced. Third, the imbalance between production and consumption, "reproduction" has long been unable to proceed, coupled with the destruction of industrial and mining enterprises, the destruction of transportation, and the stagnation of transportation, how can production be increased? Public and private are in trouble, the people are poor and the wealth is exhausted, and most people are already struggling on the hunger line, "thrift" does not need to be talked about to them! The legal currency has plummeted, and people's minds are worried about the morning and evening. People are rushing to buy supplies and use money for fear of being too late. What about savings? To wait for production and consumption to be balanced, international balance of payments to be balanced, and fiscal revenue and expenditure to be balanced, and then to reform the currency system, is really the so-called "waiting for the Yellow River to clear, how long will people live?" On the other hand, if the fiscal revenue and expenditure can really be balanced, the international balance of payments can be balanced, and the production and consumption can be balanced, then it is "peace in the world", the legal currency is omnipotent, everything is on track, and why should the financial authorities bother to reform the currency system again?

The big mistake of this popular concept at present is that it mistakenly believes that these three imbalances are factors hindering currency reform, and does not know that currency inflation is the main cause of these three imbalances. To balance fiscal revenue and expenditure, balance international balance of payments, and balance production and consumption, we must first stop currency inflation; and to stop currency inflation, we must first reform the currency system. This error in popular conception commits the mistake of putting the cart before the horse. Unfortunately, this wrong concept is coming from the financial authorities, so one mistake is repeated, and the economic problem becomes more and more serious!

Since currency reform is imminent, the question is how to carry out the reform. Some may think that China currently has neither gold nor foreign exchange, so what strength can be used to carry out currency reform? Little do they know that a country's wealth is not limited to gold and foreign exchange. In Chinese history, for five thousand years, there has been no large amount of gold, let alone foreign exchange, so how can there be an independent currency system? How can it also make the country rich and strong? In modern history, there is also a country that does not rely on gold, does not rely on foreign exchange, but can rely on its own efforts to reform the currency system, and then balance fiscal revenue and expenditure, even in Germany in October 1923. At that time, the paper mark had been declared bankrupt, and the currency system was indispensable for one day, so the industry took their factories and machines, and the agriculture took their land and real estate as preparation, and issued a "land rent mark" (Rentenmark), and the result was successful. The secret of its success lies in mobilizing physical objects (including movable and immovable property) for payment media (Mobilisierung uon Sachwerten zu Zahlungszwecken); and the conditions for its success are (1) strict organization and precise calculation, (2) international trade, just in time for surplus, no foreign exchange difficulties, (3) a civil automatic organization, the so-called "land rent mark" cannot compensate for the status, speculators cannot apply it to other countries. However, tidying up the currency system does not necessarily have to rely on gold and foreign exchange. All physical objects can be mobilized for issuance preparation, which is still a meaningful inspiration for our country.

In short, the currency reform issue in our country has reached a stage where it must be resolved! Solving it one day earlier will save one more point of national vitality, and relieve one more point of people's suffering; solving it one day later will damage one more point of national vitality, and increase one more point of people's suffering. If we do not seek a solution and let it die on its own, I am afraid that the currency system will eventually collapse one day, and the national economy will suffer serious damage! I hope that the whole country will face the reality and pay attention to it as soon as possible. More than 7,000 tons of rice were rushed from Nanjing to Shanghai, as shown in the picture: Large piles of rice bags around the Xiaguan riverside station.

### Tianjin Hosts British Delegation to China

(Continued from page 1) He said that the Chinese communists should be held responsible for destroying China's efforts to revive the country. These communists should not be compared with the communists of other countries. The leader of the British delegation to China, Amon, said that he was deeply impressed by the orderly government of Tianjin. When answering questions, Amon also said that if China reopens its inland waterways to foreign shipping, both China and Britain will benefit; because your country's ships are not sufficient. He emphasized that Britain has more experience in the shipping industry and has more investment in the business. When Amon mentioned the situation of British labor, he said that both labor and management have gradually established the necessary mechanisms for resolving labor disputes. Roberts pointed out in this regard that the number of strikes that occurred in the past two years was less than those that occurred after the First World War, and the number of strikes that occurred in Britain was also less than in the United States.

The delegation held a press conference this afternoon, and then began a farewell cocktail party to entertain leaders from all walks of life in Tianjin. Two members of the delegation visited Tianjin hospitals this morning, and the other members held a discussion with labor leaders and representatives of the Tianjin municipal government's social authorities. The delegation had lunch at Nankai University, and member Roberts visited Nankai University President Zhang Boling. Zhang has recently contracted pneumonia and is currently recuperating. McLeavy gave a speech to students at Nankai University entitled "The Development of British Autonomy".

(Reuters, Tianjin, 19th) The British delegation to China attended a reception held by the municipal authorities this afternoon, and the Speaker of the Tianjin City Council, Shi, delivered a welcome speech. Shi pointed out that although China is willing to engage in mutually beneficial economic cooperation with Britain, the Chinese people cannot forget the Hong Kong issue and hope that the delegation will pay attention to it. When Lord Amon delivered his reply, he stated that this visit to China was purely a goodwill visit and that he was visiting China as a guest invited by the Chinese government.

### Interview with Mayor You Mijian of Taiwan Province

(Continued from page 1) He said: "Taiwan has been lost for half a century and has tasted the pain of being trampled by foreign races. Every year we celebrate the Retrocession Day, which is tantamount to celebrating the new life of the Taiwanese people." He continued: "The first significance of expanding the celebration of the Retrocession Day this year is to promote mutual understanding between Taiwan and the motherland. The Taiwanese people now yearn to understand the motherland, and people in the mainland should also learn more about Taiwan. Taiwan Province has convenient transportation. If many private individuals or groups from the mainland can come to Taiwan during the Retrocession Day to visit the construction of Taiwan Province and visit Taiwanese compatriots, it will definitely make a great contribution to cultural and situational exchanges. We have now done our best to prepare various exhibitions, and the exhibition time lasts for one month. We urgently hope that people in the mainland will come to Taiwan for sightseeing and live up to our wishes."

### National Money Dealers' Congress Concludes

Declaration Issued with Five Proposals

(Central News Agency, Nanjing, 19th) The first congress of the National Money Dealers' Association held its third meeting on the morning of the 19th.

As a result of the on-site voting, 32 directors, 9 supervisors, 9 executive directors, and 3 executive supervisors were elected. Then, Qin Lanqing led the closing ceremony and passed the congress declaration, which put forward five proposals as follows: (1) The Central Bank should further play the function of "bank of banks" and relax the scope and conditions of key cash, transfer pledge, and transfer exchange for commercial banks and firms under the premise of not violating national policies. (2) It is hoped that the competent authorities will reduce the tax rate at their discretion to relieve the heavy burden. (3) Money firms should go deep into the grassroots and take the vast rural areas and the vast crowd as the focus of contact. It is also hoped that the government will strengthen active guidance and simplify management methods so that the financial industry can have the opportunity to develop freely. (4) Remind colleagues to broaden their horizons and look far ahead, to assist in the advancement of all industries under the strict compliance with national laws and regulations, to seek the welfare of the people, and to further assist the country in stabilizing finance to save the crisis of economic depression. (5) In the future, we will plan to cultivate talents, improve the quality of practitioners, use scientific management methods, cater to the trend, and improve the organization to enhance service efficiency.

### YWCA Closes Yesterday

### Excess Overseas Chinese Leave Siam to Return to Guangdong

(Central News Agency, Bangkok, 17th) The first batch of 55 overseas Chinese (mainland women and children) exceeding the quota are now on the "Hermelin" ship to Siam to return to their home. They will be able to recall the painful treatment they suffered in Siam like prisoners on their way back to their country. The "Hermelin" ship carried these Chinese immigrants to Siam last month. The ship left Bangkok Port yesterday afternoon. Our repatriated overseas Chinese were sent to the wharf by armed police escorts. Before boarding the ship, they also went through procedures such as fingerprinting. Most of the men were able to face their "fate" and remain calm. However, the women could not help but shed tears when they saw some of their poor relatives who could not afford to pay the 1,500 Siamese yuan deposit at the police station and watched them leave. The second batch of excess Chinese immigrants will be sent back to Shantou in the same situation.

### Democratic League Colludes with Communists to Expand Rebellion in South China

Li Jishen and others are increasingly actively conspiring

(Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 19th) According to reliable reports, the cooperation between Li Jishen and others and the military conspiracy of the Democratic League and the Communists is becoming more active. His cooperation with the Democratic League is to appoint Zheng Kunlian of the Democratic League as the commander of the Second Army of the Democratic Allied Forces. Zheng has selected a large number of military and political workers to set off for activities in the southern part of the country, most of whom are members of the Third Party (Zhang Bojun's Agrarian Party), the backbone of the Democratic League, totaling 24 people. Zheng's affiliation with Li was facilitated by Li Nuofu, the nephew of Li Jishen, who was sent by the Communist Party in South China. His collusion with the Communists, in addition to the aforementioned dispatch of his nephew Li Nuofu to the border between Guangdong and Guangxi to collect Zheng's troops, also sent Chen Yi (the teacher of Chen Jiongming's era) and Zheng Fukang with 50 million yuan to the Huiyang area to contact the remnants of the Communist Dongjiang Column. In addition, in order to achieve coordination and unified action, Li and the Democratic League and the Communists held a meeting at Zheng Kunhao's house in Kowloon Tong, Hong Kong on July 22 this year. The representatives of Li's side were Yun Yinglin, the representatives of the Communist side were Lin Ping, and the Democratic League was personally attended by Zheng Kunlian. As a result, it was decided that: (1) the Southern Route Liberation Army (Zheng's troops) should be renamed the Democratic Allied Forces in order to achieve unity. (2) Establish a war zone committee to lead and appoint war zone officials. (3) Organize troops as soon as possible. When there are ten regiments, two or three regiments will be transferred to develop west of Yangchun. Not long after the meeting, two regiments led by Zhuang Tian set off for activities in Yangchun, Xijiang. Later, on July 24, Li and the Communist parties again discussed the establishment of a command organization near Guangzhou in the mainland. Then, they sent personnel to the mainland for inspection. The representative of the Communist Party was Fang Fang, and the representative of Li's side was still Yun Yinglin. They went directly to Nanfen Mountain at the junction of Longmen and Conghua and Jiulian Mountain in Heping, attempting to establish bases and organize joint action agencies to carry out joint orders. Therefore, the rebellion in South China is actually a despicable act of collusion between disgruntled warlords, the Democratic League, and the Communists. However, people in South China have long seen through their treachery, and except for a few habitual bandits, all are empty deals.

### Jinan Garrison Military Court Tries War Criminals Statistics

### More than Ten Underground Money Houses in Guangzhou Sealed

(Our Newspaper, Guangzhou, 19th) In order to stabilize financial inflation and stabilize prices, the authorities here have formed an economic inspection team jointly by the municipal government and the provincial government to strictly inspect money houses and silver houses in recent days. More than ten underground money houses that illegally buy and sell gold and banknotes have been seized one after another. They were immediately sealed, and the persons in charge of the money houses were detained for handling. The telephones installed were also confiscated. However, the black market for finance is still rampant, and the authorities are determined to continue to seal illegal money houses.

### Hangzhou Commodity Prices Tend to Stabilize

Police Department Plans to Establish Economic Supervision Team

(Our Newspaper, Hangzhou, 19th) Hangzhou's commodity prices have been rising sharply in recent days due to the influence of Nanjing and Shanghai.

The Municipal Police Department received a telegram from the Police Headquarters: All provinces and cities are to increase economic inspections and list them as one of the central tasks of the police administration in the 37th year. In addition to complying with the order, it is also planned to set up an economic supervision team within the year.

### Tin and Grain Prices Rise Again

The total value of the cotton cloth is about hundreds of billions of national currency.

### 川黔湘 Highway

Severely Damaged by Mountain Floods

Currently Under Repair and Improvement

[Special Dispatch from Chongqing, This Newspaper, 19th] According to Director Xiong Zhefan of the Fifth Highway Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Transportation, upon his return from inspecting the Sichuan-Guizhou-Hunan Highway, he stated that this year's mountain floods were unprecedented, causing severe damage to the highways under his jurisdiction. The Sichuan-Shaanxi Highway suffered the most damage, while the Sichuan-Kangding Highway was less affected. The "Lianghekou" section of the Sichuan-Hunan Highway was completely washed away on both sides. The highway between Chengdu and Guanghan (measuring sixty meters in length) was almost turned into a riverbed. The Bureau is currently dispatching personnel to inspect and repair the damaged areas. As for the reconstruction of the "Zhu Hao Bridge" on the Sichuan-Hunan Highway, it is expected to be completed by the end of the month, while the "Zhuantanhe Bridge" is expected to be completed by the end of the year. The Meizi Pass and Baima Mountain highways, due to their high altitude and narrow roads, are considered a concern for military transportation and will be improved. It is reported that the Bureau's future central tasks will include: (1) organizing the road surface within its jurisdiction, and (2) repairing dilapidated bridges, striving for consolidation and durability.

Pei Wenzhong Returns to Lanzhou from Lintao: Many New Discoveries in Prehistoric Archaeology

[Central News Agency, Lanzhou, 19th] Dr. Pei Wenzhong, commissioned by the Central Geological Survey to conduct prehistoric archaeological work in Gansu, returned from Lintao. He told the Central News Agency reporter that during the four-month trip, he traversed the Miao River, the West Han River, the Tao River, and the Daxia River, collecting over twenty boxes of specimens. He discovered over ninety prehistoric human settlement sites, of which over ten are of significant value and should be excavated on a large scale immediately. Among the discoveries are various types of white pottery, black pottery, white and black painted pottery, and stone tools of unknown use, all previously unknown. Furthermore, he discovered ancient human "limestone dwellings," each with a square shape measuring approximately three meters on each side. The floor of the room was plastered with limestone, making it quite smooth, with a circular pit in the center for lighting fires. In one excavated limestone dwelling, human bones, pottery, and bone tools were discovered, confirming that its era predates the Han Dynasty, roughly corresponding to the last phase of the three major divisions of pottery culture, or possibly being a product of the original culture of the Zhou people. The discovery of this dwelling is of great significance to ancient Chinese culture. The Central Geological Survey has decided to continue this work next year. People's Movements

### The Past and Future of the Ryukyu Islands

— Central News Agency

As the preliminary peace conference with Japan is about to be held, discussions on handling the issue of territories outside of mainland Japan have recently resurfaced in the international arena. In this regard, what China is most concerned about is the future status of the Ryukyu Islands. This archipelago, spanning 2,386 square kilometers, connects China's Taiwan with Japan's Kyushu. Topographically, it divides the high seas of the Pacific Ocean from the Yellow Sea. In modern history, it served as Japan's stepping stone for its southward expansion. This article is merely a reflection of daily research, tracing its history and ethnicity, and exploring its culture and customs, so that we may have a more objective and truthful understanding of the future status of the Ryukyu Islands.

Hitoshi Ashida's "Sentimentality" Japanese Foreign Minister Hitoshi Ashida, during a reception for foreign journalists on June 5, proposed that "Japan intends to return the small islands surrounding Japan, including some islands in the Ryukyu and Kuril Islands, to Japan." Following this, he added a somewhat amusing remark: "The Ryukyu Islands are not of great economic importance to Japan, but to consider Japan's sentiments, we request their return."

Here, we must point out that Ashida's "sentiment" is unfortunately not very upright, just as the sentiments of a rapist, or at least a seducer, are not very upright. If we strictly follow his "consideration of sentiments" argument, the resulting conclusion might hurt his "sentiments," which is—the Ryukyu Islands should be returned to China.

Starting from 1372 We do not need to deny the claims of the French scholar Le Marguie and his Japanese supporter Toyohachi Fujita, who believed that the names "Liúqiú," "Liúqiú," and "Liúqiú," recorded in Chinese historical texts like the "Tongdian" of the Sui and Tang dynasties and the "History of the Song and Yuan Dynasties," did not refer to the present-day Ryukyu Islands but were actually part of Taiwan. We also do not need to trace back to the year 605 AD (the first year of the Daye era of the Sui Dynasty). We will only start from Shunten (Shenten), the Ryukyu king of the late twelfth century, whose existence is historically verifiable.

From Shunten to Shunmashunxi, Yiben, Eiso, Daisei, Eiji, Tamagusuku, and Nishi, a total of eight generations spanning 163 years, to Satto. The twenty-third year of Satto's reign, which corresponds to the fifth year of the Hongwu era of the Ming Dynasty (1372), officially opened the page of "Sino-Ryukyuan tributary history." (The Ryukyu entry in the Encyclopedia Britannica also uses this year as the start date of China's Jnvasion of Ryukyu. Although the year is not mistaken, the word Jnvasion is an inaccurate misuse of historical facts.) In that year, Emperor Taizu of the Ming Dynasty sent envoy Yang Zhanmai with an edict to his younger brother Taiki, who presented a memorial with local products. The wording of this first edict from the Chinese emperor to the King of Ryukyu was very grand. Recent articles on Ryukyu in various magazines have already quoted it, so we will not repeat it here. We will only quote a memorial and an edict from the Ryukyuan "Chuzan Seikan" itself to get a general idea:

In the autumn of the twenty-first year (of the Yongle era of the Ming Dynasty), the envoy reported: "My Ryukyu kingdom has been divided into three for over a hundred years, with endless wars and suffering among the people. Your subject, Bashi (grandson of Satto), unable to bear the sorrow, sent troops to unify the north and south mountains, now bringing peace. I humbly beseech Your Majesty to uphold your rules and grant me the title of successor, and I respectfully offer local horses and products." The Emperor of the Great Ming bestowed upon him the following: "Your Ryukyu kingdom has been divided, and the people have suffered for over a hundred years. It is your righteous army that has restored peace, which is My long-held wish. From now on, be cautious from beginning to end, and forever safeguard the sea territory, and let your descendants preserve it. Respect this decree." (Note: Ryukyu was thus unified from three parts.)

A Tribute Table From Satto to the last king, Sho Tai, a total of twenty-seven kings (or excluding Sho Shishō, which is incorrect), except for Sho Sen'i (younger brother of Sho Iku), who reigned for one year and died before requesting investiture, and Sho Kin, who died before requesting investiture at the turn of the Ming and Qing dynasties when he was still the crown prince. The remaining twenty-four kings received investiture from China. Recent people have listed this in detail (see "Observer" Volume 2, Issue 22, but that table omits Sho Shishō, which is incorrect). We will not repeat it here. Here is a separate tribute table:

(Note: The table on the right is based on the "History of the Ming Dynasty," the "Veritable Records of the Ming Dynasty," and Zhou Huang's "A Brief Account of the Ryukyu Kingdom." I do not have the "Draft History of the Qing Dynasty" on hand, so the names of the envoys and the number of missions from Sho On to Sho Tai will be supplemented later.) (Continued on Page 3)

### Left and Right Factions Engage in All-Out Struggle: Municipal Elections Begin in France; Results Will Determine France's Political Direction

[Report from This Newspaper] London, 19th Broadcast: Paris report, the municipal elections currently being held throughout France are sufficient to determine whether the country will be pro-American or pro-Soviet.

[Report from This Newspaper] London, 19th Broadcast: Paris report, France has been divided into two camps, one being the Communist Party and the other being five parties opposing the Communist Party. The municipal elections currently being held in various parts of France are sufficient to determine France's future political direction. All countries in the world attach great importance to this.

[Associated Press, Paris, 19th] People across the country began electing city councils today. The Communist Party and the Socialist Party are vying for leadership. The results of the election will test their strength. Paris will elect nineteen city councilors. Due to transportation strikes in the city, only a few workers arrived at the polling place by bicycle or on foot. However, the turnout in the suburbs was very crowded. President Vincent Auriol and his wife also appeared near the Champs-Élysées early in the morning to cast their votes first. Prime Minister Paul Ramadier flew back here after voting in Chatellerault to deal with labor disputes. The head of the Paris General Confederation of Labor, Communist Party member Henri Reynaud, announced that a meeting will be held tomorrow to decide whether to implement a general strike.

### UN Political Committee Passes Resolution to Establish a Small General Assembly; Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia Refuse to Participate in the Work of the Group

[Reuters, Lake Success, 18th] The UN Political Committee continued to debate the US proposal to establish a 57-nation standing committee on the 18th. After the Soviet representative Andrei Gromyko detailed the Soviet Union's objections, the Political Committee passed the resolution to establish a subcommittee to study the US proposal by a vote of 38 to 0, with four abstentions.

The Slavic bloc of countries has consistently refused to participate in the voting, and the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia, which were elected as members of the subcommittee, have also declared that they refuse to participate in the work of the subcommittee. Therefore, this subcommittee will be composed of thirteen countries, including China, the United Kingdom, France, the United States, Argentina, Greece, India, Canada, the Netherlands, Norway, Mexico, Bolivia, and Lebanon.

[Associated Press, Lake Success, 18th] The fifteen-nation small group will begin work next week. Chairman Henri Koch of Luxembourg announced that the seats of the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia will still be reserved in the subcommittee. After the issue of the standing committee has been temporarily resolved, the Political Committee will begin discussing the Soviet Union's accusations against "war mongers" and "war propaganda" next week.

### Debate on the Palestine Special Committee Ends; Husseini Opposes Partition

[Associated Press, Lake Success, 18th] The UN Palestine Special Committee concluded its general debate today and will discuss special proposals in the future. Arab representative Husseini spoke first today, opposing partition, stating that a small Jewish state of millions of people in the heart of the Arab world has no chance of survival. The Arabs of Palestine will never give up any part of their national territory under any pressure. Jewish representative Chaim Weizmann followed, stating that the partition of Palestine is the only practical compromise to avoid stalemate and destruction.

### United Nations Considers Establishing a Middle East Economic Commission

[United Press, Lake Success, 18th] The Egyptian delegation today submitted a proposal to the Economic Committee requesting that the Economic and Social Council consider establishing a Middle East Economic Commission. The tasks of this commission are generally the same as those of the previously established economic commissions for Latin America, Europe, and Asia. Chinese representative Zhang Pengchun stated that he welcomes this resolution because several underdeveloped regions in the world urgently need industrialization. Zhang urged the subcommittee to pay attention to the fact that the establishment of regional commissions cannot be regarded as a "permanent" measure, because this measure is incompatible with global economic unification.

### UN Economic and Social Committee Approves Financial Agreement; Soviet Request to Abolish is Rejected

[Reuters, Lake Success, 18th] The UN Economic and Social Joint Committee today approved the agreement established between the United Nations and the International Bank and the Monetary Fund by a vote of 29 to 4, with two abstentions. The Soviet Union, which is not a member of the International Bank and the Monetary Fund, accused the two institutions of lending based on political motives and of having become branches of Wall Street. New Zealand joined the Soviet Union, Belarus, and Ukraine in voting against the proposal, while Australia and Yugoslavia abstained. The anti-construction iron proposal submitted by the Soviet Union, which sought to abolish the current drafting agreement and have the Economic Committee reopen negotiations with the International Bank and the Monetary Fund, was rejected by a vote of 29 to 5, with twelve abstentions.

[Reuters, St. Louis, Missouri, 18th] Vice President Garner of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development stated here that the World Bank will not be able to provide the $3.1 billion in loans listed in the Paris Conference report for the purchase of heavy equipment.

### UK and US Agree on Reducing Tariffs

[Associated Press, Geneva, 19th] According to British spokesman Herbert Butler, the United Kingdom and the United States have reached an agreement on the main points of reducing tariffs.

### Truman and MacArthur Modestly Decline to Run for President Next Term

[United Press, Washington, 18th] According to Senator Brooks, President Truman once made a joke, willing to hand over his position to General MacArthur, but MacArthur was unwilling to accept it. Brooks told reporters that President Truman had expressed his complete confidence in MacArthur before he went to the Far East in mid-July last year. At that time, President Truman leaned back in his chair and said with a smile: "Tell MacArthur that I am already tired, and he can have my position anytime, anywhere." Brooks conveyed the President's words to MacArthur, and MacArthur replied: "Tell the President that if a general were to run against him for president, it would be Eisenhower, not MacArthur."

### European Requests for US Aid: The US Government is Capable of Meeting the Demand; Not Only Will It Not Be Reduced, But It Will Be Increased Instead

[Associated Press, Washington, 18th] Government officials said today that the United States should not only not reduce the $22.4 billion under the Marshall Plan for aid to Europe, but should increase it. This matter is only a possibility at the current research stage. On the other hand, federal financial experts have expressed deep concern about this possibility, and are seeking to reduce the amount of the original plan in order to submit it to a thrifty Congress.

[Associated Press, Washington, 18th] President Truman today released a report by Interior Secretary Krug on US resources and foreign aid, stating that the United States can implement a $20 billion aid program to the West without exhausting its own resources. This plan can offset the favorable situation of helping to open up the world economy by accelerating imports, but if the people of the country cannot cooperate with the president's proposed austerity plan, and if some export controls are not retained to avoid the abuse of our country's steel, then the above-mentioned great plan will not succeed.

### US Congressmen Advocate for Swift Aid to Europe

[United Press, Washington, October 18th] A committee of nine US congressmen, headed by Congressman Sautter, returned home on the 18th after investigating Europe for five weeks. It is said that the world they saw is a world of sickness and suffering. The Marshall Plan for aid to Europe or other similar plans should be considered immediately. It is said that Europe has fallen into a chaotic and difficult situation under the offensive of communism. In order to prevent Europe from collapsing completely, American aid must arrive as soon as possible.

### US Ambassador to the Soviet Union Scheduled to Return to His Post Today

[Associated Press, Washington, 18th] US Ambassador to the Soviet Union Walter Bedell Smith met with President Truman for 45 minutes today. He will leave for Moscow via London on the 20th to return to his post. Lieutenant General Lucius D. Clay, Commander of the US Forces in Europe, will also return to Germany on the same plane.

### The Strength of the Arab Allied Forces Should Not Be Underestimated: Hashimi Appointed Commander-in-Chief; An Egyptian Battalion Deployed to the Border of the Holy Land

[Reuters, London, 19th] The Palestinian Arab newspaper Al-Wida announced that the former Iraqi Chief of Staff and Prime Minister Hashimi has been appointed as the Commander-in-Chief of the Arab Armed Forces. The Arab League meeting held in Lebanon last week revealed that the strength of the Arab Allied Forces is approximately 220,000 men. The northern border of Palestine is currently defended by the British-trained Transjordanian army, and it is rumored that Arab troops are conducting exercises in Syria north of Lake Tiberias.

[Associated Press, Cairo, 18th] An Egyptian Defense spokesman recently stated that an Egyptian battalion has been ordered to deploy to the Irarihi region on the border of Palestine to replace the local garrison. This mobilization has nothing to do with the Arab League and is not as large as the rumored 7,000 men.

### 80th Anniversary of Alaska's Acquisition by the United States

[Associated Press, Anchorage, October 18th] Alaska was purchased from Russia by the United States eighty years ago. A celebration of the 80th anniversary of its acquisition by the United States was held here on the 18th. A train departed from Anchorage on the morning of the 18th, fully loaded with railway workers and Alaskan dignitaries, heading to the McKinley National Park. A celebration is scheduled to be held there on the evening of the 18th. The government is formulating a plan to make Alaska's defenses impregnable and to provide it with a permanent population and a basic economy. According to Undersecretary of the Interior Warner, this discussion has not yet reached the stage of detailed drafting, but it is hoped that a great plan can be made and submitted to the next House of Representatives for immediate implementation.

### Whether UK-Soviet Trade Negotiations Can Resume Depends on the Sincerity of the Soviet Union; The UK Hopes that the Soviet Union Will First Repay the Overdue Debt

[Reuters, London, 18th] Sources said that the United Kingdom still hopes that the Soviet Union will take action first to resume UK-Soviet trade negotiations. The Soviet Union's action will be to pay the latter half of the £2.4 million debt owed to the UK. This debt was originally due on August 1. Since Labor MP Zilliacus met Stalin in Sochi on the Black Sea and declared that Stalin had expressed his willingness to sign a trade agreement with the UK and hoped that negotiations could resume soon, political and economic figures in the UK, although questioning Stalin's remarks, felt that the next action should be taken by the Soviet side first. The recent breakdown of UK-Soviet trade negotiations was due to a failure to agree on the terms of the Soviet Union's repayment of its debt to the UK. Therefore, if the Soviet Union can pay the already overdue debt of £1.2 million, it would undoubtedly be the first step towards resuming trade negotiations.

### The British Parliament Will Reconvene Tomorrow

[Associated Press, London, 19th] The King of England will deliver the opening address of the parliament next Tuesday, announcing the austerity policies that the government will implement this winter to deal with the economic crisis.

### The UK and US Have Reached an Agreement on the Issue of German Occupation Costs; The Soviet Union Criticizes the UK and US Policies Towards Germany

[Reuters, Washington, 18th] After two days of secret negotiations, the UK and US delegations here have reached a draft agreement to amend the financial terms of the agreement to merge the UK and US zones in Germany. This draft agreement has been sent to London for approval by the British government. The content of the agreement is still strictly confidential, but British officials here said that their position is firm and they will never allow the UK to spend huge amounts of hard currency.

[United Press, London, 18th] Moscow Radio commentator Melnikov today criticized the UK and US policies towards Germany, believing that the purpose of this policy is to restore the German war industry. It is said that the announcement earlier this week to dismantle 610 German factories is nothing more than turning German industry into a "tool of UK and US expansion policy."

[Associated Press, Munich, 18th] Anti-American sentiment in Bavaria reached a climax today as a result of reparations being announced. A group of thousands of workers predicted that if the Augsburg machine factory is dismantled, it may be prevented by violence.

### The Past and Future of the Ryukyu Islands

(Continued from Page 2) Central News Agency

### This is True "Sentiment"

According to the "Chuzan Seikan," the types of tribute included: horses, knives, gold, silver, gold and silver powder boxes, agate, ivory, conch shells, sea bass, plam leaf fans, gilt fans, raw kernel, copper tin, raw and cooked ramie cloth, cowhide, frankincense, aloeswood, sandalwood, Chinese sweetgum, yellow ripe incense, sappanwood, ebony, pepper, sulfur, and whetstones. The gifts from the Chinese government in return included gilded silver seals (such as the seal issued in the first year of the Kangxi era, which was engraved with the large characters "Seal of the King of Ryukyu," and a new seal was issued during the Qianlong era, with the same inscription), crowns, gowns, brocades, silk, satins, pottery, porcelain, iron pots, banknotes, seagoing ships, raw ramie cloth, and embroidered shirts. Tassels and boots. Such continuous tributary acts for nearly five hundred years were almost the result of pure sentiment without a trace of coercion. (The Ryukyu entry in the Encyclopedia Britannica also states that the Chinese government never attempted to place Ryukyu under military control from beginning to end.) On the contrary, the Ryukyu king (such as Sho Shin) repeatedly requested to break the rule of one tribute every two years and change it to one tribute per year, "to rely on the favor of China and be wary of other countries' prying eyes." However, the Chinese government (such as Emperor Xianzong of the Ming Dynasty) always wanted to spare the distant people from hardship and granted their request. On one occasion, King Bunei of Chuzan presented several eunuchs to Emperor Chengzu, who ordered the Ministry of Rites to return them, arguing that "They are also human beings. How can we bear to punish them when they are innocent?" The Ministry of Rites said that it was afraid of hindering the hearts of distant people who wanted to submit, and asked that an edict be granted to stop them from presenting eunuchs again. Emperor Chengzu did not listen and ordered their immediate return, arguing that "It is better to show them practical deeds than to talk empty words. If we do not send them back now, they will want to please Me and there will inevitably be successors who come. The world values the creation of life, how can an emperor sever humanity?" During the reign of Emperor Shizu of the Qing Dynasty, "The tribute of horses was exempted as an example." During the reign of Emperor Shengzu, only sulfur, conch shells, and red copper were required to be contributed. The rest "are not native products and are exempted from tribute." At that point, Ryukyu no longer needed to consult with Malacca and Siam to be allowed to purchase tribute goods. (The consultation document is quoted in "The History of Okinawa's Marine Development" by Yasato Nobuhiro, which contains the phrase "It is deeply inconvenient that the tribute goods from your country are scarce.") The sentiment contained therein was probably not contrived. Therefore, when King Sho Nei of Chuzan was captured by Japan in 1609, the following was recorded: "In the fortieth year (of the Wanli era), the Japanese entered Chuzan and repeatedly captured the king (Sho Nei), who did not yield. The Japanese chieftain was surprised and said, 'With such an aura, no wonder he received the title from the Heavenly Dynasty,' and finally released him." Even the last king of Chuzan, Sho Tai, under the threat of the Meiji regime, refused to fill out his "petition," that is, not to pay tribute to China and not to use the Chinese calendar. That would also make him unworthy of admiration. That ancient Japanese chieftain (probably Tokugawa Ieyasu) was probably more "sentimental" than Ashida.

### Ryukyu People Are Absolutely Not Descendants of Japan

Let us try to examine the widespread nature of the relationship between China and Ryukyu from several angles:

First, in terms of race, Japan's extravagant claim that Shunten was a descendant of the Japanese Emperor is largely unreliable. The Encyclopaedia Britannica states in its Ryukyu article:

"Although the upper class of Ryukyu is remarkably similar to the Japanese, there are significant differences among the lower classes. Ryukyuans are somewhat shorter than the Japanese, but they are proportionally shorter and appear more pleasing to the eye than the Japanese, with higher foreheads, eyes that are not excessively sunken, faces that are not flat, arched eyebrows, better noses, and barely noticeable sternums, along with distinctly bright hair.

High foreheads, deep-set eyes, large noses, and bright hair undoubtedly resemble the Malay people of Southeast Asia. Compared to the narrow foreheads and short legs of the Japanese, there is not even a trace of kinship. Furthermore, according to "Chaoye Huizai" (written by Zhang Zhuo of the Tang Dynasty):

"The people (Ryukyuans) are short and resemble Kunlun people. Nowadays, there are also tall and imposing individuals. Many beautiful people are found in Shuri, Kume, Tomari, and Naha. What I saw at Gumi Mountain were people with dignified visages and well-groomed beards, quite different from ordinary barbarians."

Most of the people in Kume Mura (believed to be the royal capital) were Chinese immigrants. The "dignified visages and well-groomed beards" were clearly the result of the infusion of Chinese blood. As for today, after centuries of infiltration and integration, such individuals are no longer "occasional" but common."

### Language and Writing

Secondly, language: The forty-seven letters of the Ryukyuan I-ro-ha system (plus "冫", totaling forty-eight letters) are modeled after Japanese writing and fanqie shorthand, all based on the thirty-six letters of the Chinese Qieshu system. However, Ryukyu originally had an ancient script. According to Tao Zongyi of the Yuan Dynasty, "The Ryukyu Kingdom presents tributes to China. The memorials are written on wooden slips, about eight inches high, three-tenths of an inch thick, and five-tenths of an inch wide, decorated with metal clasps, fastened with leather cords, and inscribed horizontally with tadpole-like characters." Clearly, "I-ro-ha" is a product of later Japanese influence. Ryukyu's "memorials to the Chinese Emperor are all written in Chinese," and "correspondence with Chinese people is conducted in model writing." The calligraphy is so refined that it is "no different from that of scholars." ("Whether noble or common, old or young, Ryukyuans will offer paper to Chinese people asking for writing, regardless of their skill. They are especially respectful of letters from envoys, bowing and rubbing their hands, raising them to their foreheads before opening them," see "A Brief Account of the Ryukyu Kingdom"). Ryukyuans Cheng Shunzhe and Cai Wen were both skilled in writing, and Zhen Chang's "Tea Pavilion Record" is particularly rich in emotion and elegance.

Ryukyuan monks (famous ones include Jigai, Fukyo, Somei, and Shokyu) are said to have composed poetry with a Tang Dynasty flavor (here is one of Cheng Shunzhe's "Eight Views of Dongyuan," "Sound of Waves in the Pine Path," to give a glimpse: "Walking to Mount Zulai, all sounds are clear, the Milky Way is halfway across the sky, the early tide rises, listening closely, it's on the tall pines, the leaves welcoming the wind making the sound of water").

The origin of the Ryukyuan language is not easily traceable, but the adoption of Chinese words is very common. For example, Ryukyuans call prostitutes "侏　" ("zhu　"), which is actually the sound of the two characters "傾城" ("qing cheng," meaning "alluring city"). Ryukyuans like to use the word "　" as the most respectful term (not used for Chinese people). They call surnames "Tang names" (the thirty-six surnames bestowed by the Chinese government on Ryukyuans, with Ruan, Mao, Cai, Jin, Liang, Zheng, and Lin being the most common; see the surnames of the Ryukyu envoys in the previous table, which have already been completely Sinicized.)

The teaching materials in Ryukyuan schools are the Sacred Edicts, Chinese classics, and records of tribute to China. According to records: "The school is located east of the Sacred Temple and north of Quanquan Bridge in Irime Village. It has a collection of classics. The king also respectfully published sixteen Sacred Edicts, explaining their meaning and reading them on auspicious days. An official of the rank of Zijing Dafu is in charge. Every third, sixth, and ninth day of the month, he goes to the lecture hall to check on the students' diligence and handles matters relating to tribute to China. The lecturer is chosen from among those in Kume who are well-versed in literature, regardless of whether they are Dafu, interpreters, or scholars. He receives a salary of twelve dan per year. The annotation teacher is chosen from among those who are detailed and clear. He receives a salary of eight shi per year. Three rural schools are also established in Shuri. Children of minor officials and commoners in outer villages use temples as schools and monks as teachers. In villages near Naha, many families also have private tutors. The sound of reading can be heard throughout the night, which is commendable." (Ryukyu Kingdom Chronicles).

This means that the education in Ryukyu over a hundred years ago was almost entirely Sinicized. As for Ryukyuan students who stayed in China, from Wu Ning's adopted son "Rizizi Meirun Bama" and the village official's son "Ren Yeci" studying at the Imperial College to Nan Mu's time, according to my statistics, there were about forty-three people with verifiable names, including female students (such as Gulumu).

### Major Reductions in British Domestic and Overseas Fleets

[Reuters, Portland, Dorset, 18th] Official confirmation here: The British Home Fleet will be temporarily reduced to one cruiser and four destroyers, with the remaining ships decommissioned. In addition, twelve ships belonging to the Portsmouth Command and several ships from other domestic fleet commands will also be laid up. Overseas fleets will also be significantly reduced. According to authoritative sources, under normal conditions, the personnel of the laid-up ships, although reduced, can be fully mobilized within a few days, but this is not currently possible due to manpower shortages. The Portland's main battle fleet training team, including the battleships HMS "George V," HMS "Anson," and the aircraft carrier HMS "Victory," will not be affected. The Boys' Naval Training School in Gosport, near Portsmouth, will be closed. The Home Fleet's autumn exercises, originally scheduled for October 6, have been canceled due to fuel conservation. The flagship "Duke of York," along with cruisers and destroyers, totaling seventeen ships, were originally scheduled to participate in the exercises.

According to The Times' naval correspondent, after the British fleet reductions, there will be no British combat battleships in any part of the world actively defending the Empire. This role will be filled by four small aircraft carriers and eleven cruisers scattered across five major regions. Before the war, the Home Fleet had five battleships, two battlecruisers, two giant aircraft carriers, six cruisers, twenty-eight destroyers, and five submarines, totaling nineteen ships. Furthermore, the UK's newest 10,000-ton cruiser, HMS "Belligerent," has also been withdrawn from the Pacific Fleet and placed in reserve. The Pacific Fleet will have only two or three cruisers remaining.

### Our Bomber Returns Home Via Vietnam and Siam

### Public Utility Price Increases Finalized and Announced Today; Most Are More Than Double the Original Price

[Our Report] Authorities have decided to adjust public utility prices in the city. The new prices will be announced by Director Zhao Zengjue of the Public Utilities Bureau at a press conference this afternoon. It is understood that the new prices for streetcars, buses, and other services are scheduled to take effect on the 21st. Electricity prices, on the other hand, will be retroactively collected from October 1. The new prices are mostly more than double the original ones. Water prices are not included in this adjustment.

Director Zhao Zengjue of the Public Utilities Bureau made a final effort regarding the ad valorem issue of collecting import duties on fuel oil. He visited Zhang Fuyun, Director of the Customs Administration of the Ministry of Finance, yesterday morning to inquire whether it was possible to collect duties based on the company's contract price to reduce electricity costs. Director Zhang explained that customs has fixed regulations for collecting duties, generally based on Shanghai wholesale market prices. Customs believes that collecting duties based on the company's contract price would conflict with other duty collection methods, so there are difficulties in principle. After learning of the Customs' explanation, Director Zhao believed that the adjustment of public utility prices could no longer be delayed, otherwise the companies would be unable to sustain themselves. He then decided to invite electricity companies and customs officials to exchange views again this morning before holding a press conference in the afternoon to announce the adjusted new prices. Director Zhao told reporters that if fuel oil import duties are collected based on market prices, the new price of electricity per unit for the Shanghai Power Company will increase by another 360 yuan from the originally planned 2,700 yuan. However, the Public Utilities Bureau hopes to keep the increase as small as possible to reduce the burden on citizens. The city government will also negotiate with the Ministry of Finance on the issue of import duty rates and whether duties can be paid in installments to reduce the company's burden.

### A Groundbreaking Advancement in Document Work: Electric Chinese Typewriter on Public Display

Gao Zhongqin, the inventor of the Dianhua typewriter, has come to Shanghai from Beijing and will publicly display his electric Chinese typewriter at the office of the National Business Machines Company at 128 Sichuan Road, starting today every morning. Gao will also hold a press conference at 3:00 PM today at the International Hotel on the 14th floor to exhibit the typewriter and report on the invention process and simple operating methods. The machine is 24 inches long and has 5,400 Chinese characters and English letters, arranged according to the radicals of the Kangxi Dictionary, in the style of a telegraph codebook, with four Arabic numerals as a group. The keyboard has a total of 36 keys. After becoming proficient, the typist only needs to focus on the manuscript, and the hands naturally move to the appropriate positions to type quickly. It can type 50 words per minute and can be used for both horizontal and vertical typing. In addition to Chinese typing, it can also be used for telegraph typing. Gao is currently researching and manufacturing a Chinese typesetting machine. The Dianhua typewriter was publicly displayed 26 times from August 28 to September 9 in Nanjing at the Ministry of Communications, the Ministry of National Defense, the Central Party Headquarters, and other ministries and engineering conferences. Over 10,000 people visited. Gao told reporters that the enthusiasm during the exhibition in Nanjing was unexpected. Various government agencies are studying how to use the Dianhua typewriter to mechanize document work and expedite and strengthen administrative efficiency. The Ministry of Communications is also planning to use the machine as a basic tool to improve Chinese telegraph communications.

### Research and Development Investment of US$400,000

Gao also said that he is deeply grateful for the assistance of Mr. Wardson, the general manager of National Business Machines Company, in the development of this typewriter. Mr. Wardson is very concerned about China's industrial construction, and the investment in the research and development of the Dianhua typewriter has reached US$400,000. The Chinese government is very grateful for Mr. Wardson's assistance in China's industrial construction and has awarded him a "People's Livelihood" certificate of merit as a reward. After the Dianhua typewriter was manufactured in the United States, it was circulated for exhibition in various parts of the United States from February 1946 to May 1947, with an audience of over 100,000 people. All agreed that the structure of the machine would bring about a groundbreaking revolution in Chinese typing and the future of China's telecommunications industry because it is quick and convenient to use. Gao was originally the director of the Telecommunications Department of the Central News Agency. In 1940, he went abroad to study and research electric typing. After returning to China, he became a consultant to the Central News Agency and an engineer at National Business Machines Company. The Central News Agency is also studying the use of this typewriter to improve news telecommunications work.

Gao is also scheduled to give individual demonstrations at the Municipal Government, the Telecommunications Administration of the Ministry of Communications, the International Radio Station, the Bankers' Association, and other agencies within the week.

### Xiong Foxi Lectures on How to Watch Movies: Story, Characters, Structure, and Spirit Are All Major Conditions of Movies

[Our Report] This newspaper held its 29th Sunday special broadcast yesterday at the Minsheng Radio Station. We invited Xiong Foxi, principal of the Municipal Drama Experimental School, to lecture on "How to Watch Movies." Citizens often watch movies as a regular and sophisticated form of entertainment. Movies are called the eighth art. How should they be watched? It is worth studying. First, is the movie's story. The general audience pays attention to interesting stories, pursuing sensory pleasure, but a good story alone is not enough; it also needs to be matched with other techniques.

### Distinguishing Good from Bad

Second, the movie's characters. The movie must have individual, three-dimensional, and fleshed-out characters. Puppet characters cannot arouse the audience's interest. Third, the movie's structure. Structure is different from story. A story is a complete explanation, but how the plot is arranged, how it begins, develops, turns, and concludes must be echoed throughout, without flaw. Structure is like building a house. Where should the door be opened, where should the window be opened? There must be a plan first. The movie must also have a pre-planned layout to have a complete structure. Fourth, the movie's spirit. After watching a movie, we feel it is very good, or we feel it is very bad. What is the standard for so-called good and bad? It depends on whether it has value, whether the subject matter it depicts is extracted from real life. A good writer, producer, and director will always find a healthy theme to give the audience spiritual enlightenment. An audience member must undergo a spiritual change between entering the movie theater and leaving the movie theater. In other words, when entering the movie theater, the spirit is empty, but after watching the movie, the spirit is full. This is a good film. As for stories that are a mess, what appears on the screen are abstract, puppet-like characters, and the content is to anesthetize the audience. Such a film is unhealthy and leads the audience down a path of depravity. It is a bad movie.

### Several Minor Issues

The above is a slightly spiritual discussion of the movie's story, characters, and structure. Here are a few minor issues: The actor's acting skills. If the actors do not perform well, a beautiful movie cannot be created. Actors have a bad tendency to focus on "gimmicks." The so-called "gimmicks" are external, contrived, unreasonable, and unhealthy movements to win the audience's laughter, not actions that come from the heart. If there is no inner feeling, only making gestures cannot move the audience. The issue of beautiful images. Movies contain pictorial beauty and architectural beauty. As far as acting is concerned, the actor's face must face the audience, but it also depends on the situation. If the scene is a deep blue sky, a bright moon hanging high, and a pair of lovers whispering sweet words in the window, it would be more beautiful if the two people turned their backs to the audience and the man slowly put his hand on the woman's shoulder than if their faces were facing the audience.

### Building National Art

The issue of musical beauty. The common requirement for actors is to have clear diction, so that every word can reach the audience's ears. Not only should they be heard clearly, but they should also have musical rhythm. However, it also depends on the situation. For example, in a scene of a crowd roaring in anger, the combination of low and high tones, although not necessarily heard clearly, is like listening to a tragic song. Also, when a person is angry, the blurred and unclear voice can particularly show strength. Finally, talking about the director, in the movie, the director's position is higher than everything else, and his responsibility is the greatest.

Finally, I want to ask everyone to pay attention. Chinese movies have a history of thirty years. Although they have made many achievements, there are still many shortcomings. In addition, recently, American Hollywood movies have flooded our country's market. Although Hollywood has good movies, there are too many unhealthy and bad movies. They use the performance of big thighs and eroticism as a gimmick, leading our audience into unhealthy deviations. This is truly a national worry. We want to build our own national art. We hope that the audience will cherish our country's developing movies and write down as many opinions as possible, publishing them in newspapers and magazines, as a reference for improvement in the Chinese film industry.

### The Issue of Zhuzhai and Xinzhuang's Jurisdiction. Representatives of the City will Meet Today. The Zhuzhai Progress Association Invited Reporters to Visit.

[This Newspaper News] The issue of the jurisdiction of Zhuzhai and Xinzhuang, caused by the provincial and municipal demarcation issue of Shanghai and Jiangsu, will be brought up for discussion at today's demarcation meeting between representatives of the province and city, and the final direct consultation will be held. Yesterday, the Zhuzhai Town Local Construction Promotion Association invited the newly opened boundaries of the city to visit the town.

### Administrative Cannot Be Unified

Zhuzhai is located west of Shanghai, accessible by the North Zhai Highway, about a 40-minute car ride. There is an elementary school in the town with more than 800 households. During the unrest, there was a "Three Boundaries Official" set up, because the area was located at the boundary of Jiading, Qingpu, and Shanghai City. Every time you cross a bridge or cross a street, the boundaries of the province and city are very different, even between households, there are differences between Shanghai City and Jiading County. Because of this, the administration cannot be unified, security is difficult to maintain, and construction cannot progress. The townspeople are deeply worried about this. Recently, during the provincial and municipal demarcation, Zhuzhai was still divided into two. The Ministry of Interior intends to划蟠龙港北岸划归嘉定县, which caused the people of the whole town to vigorously oppose it, and repeatedly went to the competent authorities to petition, requesting to change Zhang Shengang as the boundary between Shanghai City and Jiading County of Jiangsu Province, and to unify the entire town under the jurisdiction of Shanghai City.

### Suggest a Public Referendum

The town has convened a people's protection congress due to the demarcation issue, and elected seven representatives including Shanghai Municipal Councilor Hou Junren to argue based on reason, listing 14 reasons. Among them, it is briefly stated that the customs, people's sentiments, culture, economy, and habits of Zhuzhai Town are closely related to Shanghai City. In terms of transportation, it is about 20 li away from Shanghai City. The municipal government has built the North Zhai Highway, which arrives in the morning and noon. It is more than 40 li away from Jiading, and there is no road to access it. It is only known that it is inconvenient to pass orders from Zhuzhai to Jiading by detouring through Shanghai City. The townspeople hope that the Zhuzhai Town issue in this Suhu demarcation meeting can attach importance to public opinion and make a reasonable solution, and can suggest holding a public referendum when necessary to solve the issue of affiliation.

### The Government Agreed to Consider Exempting Grain from Nutrition Tax. A Statement by Petition Representative Qu Zhenhua

[This Newspaper News] Forty-four representatives from chambers of commerce and grain dealers in various provinces, cities, and counties went to Beijing to petition for the exemption of grain from operating taxes. They petitioned to eight government agencies, including the National Government, the Executive Yuan, the Legislative Yuan, the National Political Council, the Central Party Headquarters, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Food, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and the Ministry of Social Affairs. The heads of various agencies expressed great sympathy for the situation of the grain industry and agreed to consider it. The representatives have returned to Shanghai one after another. According to Qu Zhenhua, the standing director of the Rice Business Association, the price of grain is related to the national economy and the people's livelihood. All countries in the world do not levy business tax on the grain industry. At this time when grain prices are soaring, we must not levy business tax to stimulate grain prices. The levy of grain tax forces grain merchants to increase selling prices. The so-called "the wool comes from the sheep." The propertied class is nothing, but the common people really feel unbearable. Fortunately, all government agencies have expressed sympathy for this petition. The Legislative Yuan has agreed to consider the point of excluding the grain industry from the amendment of the Business Tax Law. Minister Yu of the Ministry of Finance also sincerely agreed to consider it, so the hope for this petition is very high, and there will be specific measures in about two weeks.

Soldiers can exchange for third-class military tickets with their vehicle passes. Military carriages are added to the specified train numbers. If there are first and second class train numbers, a second-class car and a third-class car will be added. Officers who ride for free will sit in the added second-class military carriages, and soldiers will sit in the added third-class cars to avoid mixing. If there is no early train with first and second class, two third-class cars will be added, with officers and soldiers occupying one each to avoid mixing. The number of preferential cars should be stipulated to avoid crowding. When the quota is exceeded, ticket exchange certificates for the next preferential treatment will be issued in order. Single-trip soldiers carrying luggage shall be handled in accordance with the railway regulations. If single-trip soldiers carry goods of a commercial nature in addition to luggage, they shall pay fees in accordance with the railway regulations. Passengers who ride without tickets, ride beyond the station, and ride beyond the class must make up the ticket in accordance with the regulations. Soldiers who carry prohibited items shall be confiscated and handed over to the local military police agency for handling in accordance with the law, and reported to the superior for record. Female employees of military agencies who have complete certificates shall be treated equally, and military dependents are not included in the preferential treatment. In the event of a dispute, the local military transportation office is responsible for handling it and reporting it to the superior for record. These measures have been submitted to the Ministry of Communications by the bureau and transferred to the Ministry of National Defense for approval. The above measures and their train numbers will be announced and implemented within days.

### Visit to the Toupeng Disaster Area. Impressions of the Tanggong Bureau's Soil Retention Work

[Report from Hangzhou, This Newspaper, 10th] Toupeng Town safely survived the biggest "ghost tide" in mid-July, and the residents congratulated each other and built a structure in the engineering site. On the 13th, 14th, and 15th days of the lunar calendar, they specially performed three days of drama to celebrate the success of the engineering office. Mid-month is the last big tide of this year. On the 18th (October 2nd), Chinese and foreign people went to Haining Baibao to watch the tide, still "the tide of people is as big as the tide of the sea, and the sound of people is louder than the sound of the tide." General Kirk of the United States also took a plane to Qingdao to watch the tide. However, in order to see whether Toupeng can be preserved in the great battle between man and the tide, the reporter specially went to the disaster area for an inspection for a week.

The reporter arrived in Toupeng at noon. The first thing that caught his eye was the many bricks and tiles taken down from the houses, and the broken houses that had been partially demolished and stopped. However, many red and green slogans were newly posted on the walls of those broken houses, praising the achievements of the engineering office and Director Dong. Walking to the river, the reporter met an old man and asked him about

### The Situation of the Collapsed Bank

He said slowly while looking at the river: "Since the 'Showa Era', the tide has been entering more than ten miles in the past seven or eight years. My home was originally over there." Following the direction he pointed, I saw only a vast river, with wave after wave crashing against the former wave. There were no traces of houses and fields. I asked again: "How many houses have collapsed?"

"There must be no less than four or five hundred. There are more than a dozen bao households alone!"

"Where do they live now?"

"Those who had time to demolish their houses sold the bricks and tiles and went to other places to make a living. Those who didn't have time to demolish their houses only had enough to

### Escape with Their Lives

Some are still farming in the surrounding villages, and some are living in relatives' homes. Fortunately, no lives have been lost in the tide."

Right across from us, the Zhenhai Pagoda in Haining is thirty miles away across the river, and can be seen in the distance. Under that pagoda, it is crowded with elegant men and women from all over the world watching the tide, but the mood here is so different. It is truly "the same great tide, two different views."

### Soil Retention Engineering Office

After the establishment of the office, it was decided to build a seawall at the east corner of Toupeng Town first, using a large number of peach stones to protect the bank. The original plan was to build three seawalls, using 10,000 cubic meters of stone and 105 wooden cages. The revetment would use 10,800 cubic meters of stone and 360 wooden cages, requiring a total construction fund of 1,493,787,000 yuan, and 708,876 catties of flour for the workers' wages, totaling 2,468,491,500 yuan, with the local burden of 900 million yuan and the rest allocated by the Tanggong Bureau. As of October 1st, 527.48 cubic meters of rubble and more than 50 wooden dragons have been thrown, fighting hard against the tide for half a month before laying the foundation and ensuring that it does not collapse. However, due to the limitation of funds, materials, and manpower, coupled with the impact of rising prices, the project is limited to East Street. The original plan could not be completed. The estimated price was only 823,000 yuan per unit, but now the wood alone costs 1.25 million yuan, plus the internal stone and the external stone, it costs a total of 3.95 million yuan. However, Toupeng

### The Autumn Splendor of Lion Grove Garden: Red Elm-leaf Plums and White Pear Blossoms

[Our Newspaper, Tianjin, 19th] Today, under the warm autumn sun, I drove to the Lion Grove Garden, the Tianjin Municipal Second Hospital, to admire the pear blossoms and elm-leaf plums blooming in late autumn. The pear trees are over ten feet tall, and the elm-leaf plum trees are also over ten feet tall. They are all planted next to the hospital's office. Although the autumn leaves have fallen in the courtyard, the cypress trees remain green, while the other plants have withered. The pear trees that blossomed have long since shed their leaves, but the elm-leaf plums still retain their green leaves, with clusters of snow-white flowers blooming brightly among the few remaining leaves, facing the sun. The elm-leaf plums still have some residual leaves, and the newly opened red flowers are densely clustered on the branches, vividly eye-catching. The vibrant red elm-leaf plum blossoms and the pure white pear blossoms complement each other, filling the courtyard with the colors of spring.

### The Past and Future of Ryukyu

(Continued from Page 3) Central News Agency

### Living Habits

Regarding living customs, a few examples are listed below:

Throughout history, [the Ryukyuans] have respectfully followed the orthodox calendar. When tribute envoys arrived in Beijing, they would always wait for the bestowal of the seasonal calendar before returning. On the first and sixth days of the New Year, they would pay respects and offer congratulations like the Chinese.

On the fifth day of the fifth month, they would hold dragon boat races (one in Naha, one in Kume, for a total of three dragon boats) and eat zongzi. They would also worship and celebrate the festival with wine, just like the Chinese.

On the fifteenth day of the seventh month, they would hold a ghost festival to worship ancestors and ancestral spirits. Some would also invite monks to perform the Ullambana ceremony. Flying kites was only done in September.

On the eighth day of the twelfth month, the whole country would make glutinous rice cakes. On the thirtieth and fourth days [of the twelfth month], they would send off the Kitchen God, and on the fifth day of the first month of the following year, they would welcome him back, just like in our country. Many households had shrines for deities, with incense burners placed in green stones. Some say this was for ancestral spirits. Many also worshiped the five characters "Heaven, Earth, Sovereign, Parent, Teacher." In Shuri, there was a "She Huai" (社壞), in Tomigusuku, there was a "Rain Altar" (雨壇), on the hills of Shuri, there was a "Cloud Altar" (雲壇), in Naha, there was a "Thunder God Temple" (雷神廟), and in Kume, there was a "Temple of Literature" (文廟). In the center of the main hall was an image of Confucius, with two shrines on either side containing images of the Four Associate Sages, each holding a scripture. In Naha, there was a "Temple of Guan Yu" (關帝廟) (inside the temple were inscriptions by Wang Yuyang and couplets by Xu Baoguang, saying: "A loyal heart always hangs on the Fusang sun, Righteous spirit passes through the ocean winds of time."), and temples to the Dragon God and the Water Goddess, just like in China (all the above can be found in Zhou Huang's *Ryukyu Kingdom Chronicle*). "The scholar-officials enjoy playing weiqi, and the monasteries often provide weiqi for guests. If they are tired, they are offered pillows, like the Chinese stationery boxes, with three or four layers inside, each person taking one," which reminds one of the refined demeanor of Chinese monks and scholars who "close the flower courtyard with the sound of chess" (Zhang Xueli's *Record of an Envoy to Ryukyu*).

Scholar-officials often drink and make merry. They like to use the "finger-guessing game" to toast, singing in a drawn-out tone and accompanying themselves with the sanshin… In autumn nights, the sound of silk and bamboo instruments fills the air, and many sing Chinese string and wind songs.

(Wang Yi's *Miscellaneous Records of an Envoy to Ryukyu*)

The tea cups are yellow with green floral patterns. The cups have a red and black lid, and a hollow saucer underneath. The cups are quite large, but the tea is only filled to two or three tenths. A small piece of fruit is placed in a spoon inside the cup. This is learning the Chinese method of offering tea. (Xu Baoguang's *Zhongshan Chuanshin Lu*) (The rest will not be recorded).

The living customs of the Ryukyu people, from the broad lower social strata to the scholar-official class, were deeply and universally imbued with a Chinese flavor. As the Reuters reporter who landed with the American forces in Ryukyu on April 10 of the previous year saw, "Everywhere is a nation dominated by Chinese culture" (Reuters, Okinawa dispatch, April 10, 1945). This is by no means accidental, but rather the natural result of the fusion of Chinese and Ryukyuan sentiments over five or six hundred years (at least).

### A Glimpse of Japanese "Sentiment"

Conversely, the relationship with Japan, ever since Tokugawa Hidetada sent troops to forcefully capture King Sho Nei of Zhongshan in 1607, has always been characterized by undisguised overbearingness. This included forcibly making Ryukyu subordinate to Satsuma, interfering with its finances, and establishing the rule that the Ryukyu heir must visit Kagoshima (a Japanese territory northeast of Ryukyu) at the age of fifteen. When the Meiji Emperor ascended the throne (in 1868), the Ryukyu king was forced to acknowledge Japan as his sovereign, to prohibit Ryukyu from paying tribute to China, and to use the Meiji era name. As for the Taiwan Incident of 1874 (the thirteenth year of the Qing Dynasty), which was caused by the accidental killing of Ryukyuan sailors by the Botan tribe of Taiwanese aborigines, Japan used it as an excuse to fabricate a three-article peace treaty, mediated by the British envoy Wade, which vaguely placed Ryukyu under the jurisdiction of the Japanese Ministry of Home Affairs, treating it the same as any domestic prefecture. Finally, in 1879 (the fifth year of the Guangxu reign), the Japanese showed their true colors, sending several warships to formally annex Ryukyu as Okinawa Prefecture, and forcibly taking the former king (Sho Tai) to Tokyo, appointing a prefectural governor to administer the prefecture. The protests raised by our country have continued for nearly a century, and it is truly time for a response to be obtained!

### The Future of Ryukyu

Let us temporarily set aside emotions and focus solely on the overall security of the Pacific. Ryukyu, a large archipelago of 473 islands of varying sizes between Kyushu and Taiwan, with an area of 2,386 square kilometers, is Japan's stepping stone for its southward (aggressive) expansion. At the same time, it divides the Pacific Ocean from the Yellow Sea, and some even compare it to the "Dardanelles Strait." The issue of Ryukyu's sovereignty was briefly discussed last October. At that time, some senior American officials believed that "if the Ryukyu Islands were to change sovereignty, they should be handed over to China, or the islands should be placed under the trusteeship of the United Nations, with China solely responsible for administrative matters, to which the United States would also agree" (see United Press International Washington dispatch, October 9, 1946). The views of another group of Americans are represented by Professor Grosoy. In his book "The Land and People of Asia," when discussing the problems occurring in the Western Pacific, he stated: "It would be sound military strategy to deprive defeated Japan of its foreign territories as an aggressive military state... If this is implemented, Taiwan should be returned (note: Taiwan has already been returned to China) and Ryukyu to China" (chapter in the original book, Pacific Basin).

In short, although the two groups have different focuses, they both agree that Ryukyu should be returned to China. We firmly believe that this is a correct and timely conclusion. Recently, a group of revolutionary patriots in Ryukyu, led by Xi Yoming, launched a movement for Ryukyuans to return to their motherland. In order to consider the deep-rooted emotional ties between China and Ryukyu that have lasted for five or six hundred years, and for the sake of the security of the entire Pacific, and even the security of the entire world, we have reason and determination to respond to this movement!

### The Most Severe Riverbank Collapse

Houses, including the land, only sell for 1.3 million [currency unit] per jian, so the cost of rescue exceeds the value of the houses being rescued. What's worse, the Nansha people themselves are not up to the task. Director Dong said, "Not only are they unwilling to contribute a single cent of the 900 million [currency unit] in funding, but they also have low morals and lack unity. They would rather see someone else's house collapse, and then their own, than cooperate to carry out riverbank protection work. Therefore, the riverbank collapse is becoming increasingly rampant. We can only rescue the overall situation according to plan. The small collapses in the Western Street caused by wave impact are being handled by the residents themselves, who are provided with materials. Some people are too lazy to help their neighbors. Currently, what we can take comfort in is that in the area east of our project, the high tide has already encroached 150 meters, and its length has exceeded that of Toupeng Town. Toupeng had already collapsed during the ghost tide."

Toupeng was originally the economic center of Nansha, and the locals called it "Little Shanghai." During the most severe riverbank collapse, it was once like a dead city, but now it is as active as before. (Reporter Huang Xingtain)

The crowd was still angry and surrounded the police station. The guards at the gate opened fire to suppress the crowd in self-defense, and several people were accidentally injured by stray bullets. Two people died from their injuries, further exacerbating the public's anger. Unable to break in, they turned to the county government and broke into the inner hall. County Magistrate He Qin was severely beaten.

### Yarn Factories Purchase National Cotton from Production Areas; National Bank Allows Handling of Export Financing; Maximum Export Financing Amount for Each Company Not to Exceed 20 Billion

[Report from this newspaper] President Zhang Jia of the Central Bank summoned representatives of national and private yarn factories on the afternoon of the other day to discuss how to stabilize yarn prices. The meeting ended at about 8 p.m. It is reported that it was generally agreed during the discussion that the main reason for the failure of yarn prices to continue to fall is the increasing cost of cotton. For example, although Lingdou cotton clothes have fallen to 4.5 million yuan per dan in recent days, they are still far beyond the actual cost of cotton farmers. Therefore, it was decided that new state-run and private yarn factories, in conjunction with the Farmers Bank and cotton merchants, should organize joint institutions when purchasing cotton in various production areas, and jointly negotiate cotton prices to maintain the interests of cotton farmers, without raising prices or grabbing dirt, in order to stabilize cotton prices. In addition, each factory felt that it lacked funds to purchase national cotton. After discussion, President Zhang allowed each yarn factory that purchases national cotton to handle export financing. Based on yarn factories with more than 10,000 spindles, about 3 billion yuan of export financing can be handled per 10,000 spindles. However, the maximum amount of export financing for each company shall not exceed 20 billion yuan. Once approved by the Four Joint Offices, it can be implemented.

### Spinning and Adjustment Committee to Hold Registration of Cotton Yarn Processing Industry; Cotton Yarn Exceeding Storage Quantity to Be Purchased at Import Price

[East China News Agency] The Society, ordered to carry out the registration of yarn and cloth in Mu City, has already completed it. It is now known that the association will also hold the cotton yarn processing industry registration? In order to prevent hoarding and speculation, and to clarify the consumption of cotton yarn. Registration will be handled first in Shanghai, and then promoted to other areas, in order to ensure that the allocation of sales is carried out. The Bureau of Mines is now actively deliberating on the "Implementation Plan for Adjusting the Supply and Demand of Yarn and Cloth" stipulated by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and will soon be implemented. In addition, the association restricts the storage of yarn and cloth to the quantity and storage period. The cotton yarn stored in each yarn factory processing factory should be sufficient to supply the factory for three months. Yarn stores are not allowed to store cotton yarn for more than forty-five days. Cloth merchants are not allowed to store cloth exceeding twice the amount of their self-reported monthly sales. If the storage of yarn and cloth exceeds the time limit and quantity, in addition to purchasing at the cost price, and reporting in accordance with this state, will be implemented in accordance with the "Adjustment Plan," it is said.

### Gasoline Panic in This City Entirely Caused by Hoarders

Responsible person of Shi Shan Company said that according to the responsible person of the China Shi Shan Company, the supply of gasoline in this city, according to the actual situation, is sufficient for the use of all cars in the city. The panic that is currently occurring is entirely caused by the psychological effect of the general car class, and the purchase and hoarding of gasoline by general hoarders. Although the local authorities have strictly controlled the situation with towels, the black market for gasoline cannot be avoided. Hoarders are still secretly raising prices. In order to completely eliminate the black market, the best way is to thoroughly check the inventory. All merchants and citizens with cars must restrict the amount of newly existing gasoline. If the inventory survey is accurate, and then a reasonable distribution is made, it can have a considerable effect. If there are any concealments, a method of rewarding whistleblowers can be adopted to solve the problem. In this way, the supply of gasoline will not cause panic again.

### China Trust Bureau Decides on Artificial Silk Allocation Price

[Report from this newspaper] The China Trust Bureau held an artificial silk pricing meeting and decided on the list prices for the artificial silk to be distributed by the bureau from the 20th to the 26th of this month.

Tianqiao 1A 64.4 million yuan, 2A 63.12 million yuan, 3A 61.18 million yuan, 4A 57.96 million yuan. Others 1A 64 million yuan, 2A 62.72 million yuan, 3A 60.8 million yuan, 4A 57.6 million yuan.

### Tianjin Cotton Cloth Prices Fall, Eight Speculative Businesses Close Down

[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 19th] The price of Tianjin cotton cloth has gradually fallen from the peak price of 900,000 yuan per piece this week. On the 18th, the market price of Zhongfang Hong Wufu cloth had fallen to 660,000 yuan. Eight yarn and cloth stores here have closed down due to speculative losses. Their managers have also been detained by the competent authorities and will be severely punished according to law.

### Hangzhou Commodity Prices Decline

Commodity prices in Hangzhou generally fell on the 18th. The reason is that Shanghai's implementation of special-grade inspections of goods has curbed speculative traders, resulting in stagnant market transactions. Rice prices have fallen by 30,000 yuan across the board. Shangshu white rice has dropped from 604,000 to 571,000 yuan. The highest price for Dajian, a large commodity traded in the market, is 418,000 yuan, followed by 465,000 yuan. Edible oil has plummeted, with each dan falling back by 130,000 yuan. Peanut oil is 1.8 million yuan, tea oil is 1.7 million yuan, and rapeseed oil is 1.55 million yuan. Silk and yarn fabrics continue to depreciate. Factory silk is 64 million yuan per dan, and Hangzhou warp silk is 48 million yuan, a decrease of 2 million yuan compared to the 17th. Tianqiao 20-count yarn is 23.8 million yuan per piece, and 12-pound Longtou fine cloth is 4.85 million yuan per piece.

### Expensive Cigarette Wrapping Paper Threatens Small and Medium-Sized Cigarette Factories; Paper for Each Carton of Cigarettes Has Reached 10 Million Yuan

Recently, the highest rate of increase in the price of cigarette raw materials is paper. Although the price of finished cigarettes has also increased along with the rising prices of all goods, the rate of increase is far less than the rapid increase in the price of paper. In terms of the market price of various types of paper in the past week, transparent paper has increased from 6.5 million yuan per ream to 15 million yuan, trademark copperplate paper has increased from 3.5 million yuan to 7.5 million yuan, and the market price of Minsheng paper has reached 40 million yuan per carton. The prices of other packaging papers have also risen sharply. According to people in the cigarette industry, the total cost of cigarette paper circles, trademark paper, transparent paper, steel paper, and other essential items for each carton of cigarettes has reached 10 million yuan, and the price of tobacco leaves is not included. The factory price of ordinary mid-grade cigarettes is about 11 million yuan, so the selling price of finished products is far less than the cost. This is the case for medium-sized cigarettes that already have actual sales. As for small factories, it is even more difficult to increase sales because their brands have not yet become widespread. The soaring prices of various raw materials have caused their costs to increase day by day, and small factories lack large amounts of cash to operate, so they also need to borrow large amounts of funds. Therefore, the recent soaring prices of cigarette raw materials are particularly painful for small and medium-sized cigarette factories.

### Cigarette Industry Association Requests Increase in Foreign Exchange for Cigarette Paper Circles

The National Cigarette Industry Association previously submitted a request to the Ministry of Finance in order to solve the difficulties in the supply of cigarette paper. The request was for foreign exchange for self-provided cigarette paper circles, steel paper, and to relax the foreign exchange quota for various raw materials. It is now known that the association has received instructions from the Ministry of Finance stating that the government has already promulgated implementation rules for the self-provided foreign exchange portion of each of these raw materials, and they can be followed. As for relaxing the quota, they should directly request the approval of the Rolling Council. At the board meeting convened yesterday, the Cigarette Association stated that the cigarette industry is one of the heavy industries, and its products are daily necessities that are indispensable to people's lives. The amount of tax revenue it pays to the government is the highest among all industries, and the government should not classify it as a luxury or consumable item. Currently, cigarette factories are most in need of paper circles and steel paper, so it is necessary to request the Standing Committee to approve the early delivery of paper circles, etc., which are self-provided foreign exchange in the existing customs warehouse, in order to avoid production interruption and affect tax revenue. As for the relaxation of the foreign exchange quota, the most lacking raw material for cigarettes is paper circles. In the quarterly quota of 780,000 US dollars, the Inner Yin Cigarette Company accounts for 100,000 US dollars, the cigarette industry in various places outside the city accounts for 150,000 US dollars, and the 10+ cigarette factories in Mu City only account for 530,000 US dollars, which is a huge difference from the actual production requirements. Therefore, the expansion of the foreign exchange quota for paper circles is extremely urgent. It was decided to request the authorities to increase the foreign exchange for paper circles to 1 million US dollars. If the authorities find it inconvenient to increase the amount of foreign exchange, they would rather reduce the amount of tobacco leaves to compensate for the amount of paper circles. This is because tobacco leaves can be increased, while paper circles cannot be increased domestically for a while.

Spring and Autumn

Mr. Chen Shuren, an advanced member of the Party and State, followed Dr. Sun Yat-sen in his early years, engaging in revolution and journalism. Later, after completing his studies and returning to China, he assisted the central government, led overseas Chinese, and made many contributions before and after the War of Resistance. Throughout his life, he meticulously studied literature and art, and his words and deeds were consistent. His poetry, calligraphy, and painting have reached the level of three perfections, unique for a time.

Mr. Chen also once said that he had been engaged in art for nearly fifty years, and although he was bound by political affairs in the middle, he never neglected it. Moreover, he held a reformist view of art, believing that art is creative and progressive. If it is stale and repetitive, it loses its value. From this, we can see the revolutionary spirit and unique insights of a revolutionary artist.

Furthermore, perhaps some people still advocate that artists should create art for art's sake, and some even regard artistic creation as the manufacture of commodities. However, Mr. Chen has consistently advocated that art should aim to contribute to society, the nation, and the world. He has repeatedly promoted the theory of personal art, believing that all literary and artistic creations must have personality as the backbone, and that writers must first have cultivation in morality and ethics before they can have great gains. This saying is in line with Wen Zhengming's saying that "If one's character is not high, one cannot use ink," and Wang Yuanqi's saying that "Learning to the end is first and foremost valuing literary character." It is an unchanging truth.

### Mr. Chen Shuren's Paintings

— Pan Gongzhan

Now, reading Mr. Chen's works such as "Red Cotton," "Green Bamboo," "Banana Tree," and "Willow Birds," not only are they full of spring scenery and extraordinary elegance, but they are also ethereal and transcendent, with a unique charm. Figures such as "Donkey Driver" and "Coolie," and landscapes such as "Emei," "Jianmen," and "Lushan," are full of deep and majestic meaning and poetic flavor. Only those who take nature as their teacher can reach this realm. Mr. Chen has always taken praising nature and promoting labor as the keynote of his creations. Whether it is poetry, calligraphy, or painting, the selection of materials and the setting of intentions are based on this keynote. Combined with his integrity and lofty character, and his calm and humble disposition, viewing his person is like seeing a clear sky after rain, and viewing his paintings is like seeing a transcendent world. The painting is like the person, and the person is like the painting. It is the success of personal cultivation and the expression of artistic purity.

Mr. Chen's works are not only loved by the people of China for a long time, but also have long been praised in the international art world. Now that Mr. Chen is about to hold an art exhibition in Shanghai, and will soon be preparing to go abroad, the people of Shanghai can feast their eyes, and in the future, China's art and culture will also be promoted overseas through Mr. Chen's trip. I will use a few words to celebrate the future of our national art.

### Biography of Stendhal

— Zhao Jingshen

Few writers have been as neglected by their contemporaries as Marie-Henri Beyle, whose pseudonym was Stendhal (1783-1842). His two masterpieces, "The Red and the Black" (Le Rouge et le Noir) and "The Charterhouse of Parma" (La Chartreuse de Parme), were commercially slow to succeed and were often ignored by critics. His famous essay "On Love" was seventy years earlier than Freud (Freud called him a psychological genius), but it sold only seventeen copies.

It was not until forty years after Stendhal's death that he was discovered, cheered by Paul Bourget and the new psychological novelists, and admired by Zola and the self-righteous writers. By this time, there was almost as much written about his literature as there was about Napoleon.

Recently, Matthew Josephson published "Stendhal: A Biography," and C.K. Scott-Moncrieff translated Stendhal's "Armance."

"Armance" is an exquisitely researched retreat. Gide considered it a neglected masterpiece. In addition, Montcrieff also translated many stories adapted by Stendhal based on 16th-century Italian chronicles, which are mostly about familiarity, robbery, crime, and revenge, which are worth reading, but are not representative works of Stendhal. The total name of the legacy book is "The Shorter Novels of Stendhal." Unfortunately, his autobiographical letters and diaries have not yet been translated. Apart from Gide, it can be said that no writer has spoken so frankly about himself.

Josephon's biography contains many new materials. Stendhal is not as famous as Balzac or Zola, so it gives us a fresh feeling.

"The Red and the Black" is a true reflection of the times, and it is also excellent in depicting inner complexity. Both literary schools have accepted Stendhal's legacy: one is writing Binyism, and the other is psychological novels.

### Bird Stories

— Chang Lan

If you feel lonely during this long night, then put down the book in your hand, extinguish the flickering candlelight, let the moonlight flow into this small house, and I will tell you a story about a bird; although I know that a story cannot dilute your deep melancholy. But other than that, I really have no better way to pass this quiet and restless long night.

The story goes like this:

Many strange birds are said to have their own series of sad encounters, like the cuckoo crying blood in the middle of the night, and the bush warbler chirping "Better to return home." In the silent night, they all sing to their heart's content, as if venting their depression and sorrow through this unrestrained singing. The story of the "Sesame Bird" that I am going to tell here is said to have an even more tragic background, so its cries are even more mournful.

In a remote mountain town, many years ago, a family lived in a mountain valley: a mother-in-law, a daughter of fifteen or sixteen years old, and a son who was not yet one year old. According to the local custom, they would buy a girl to be a child bride for their child, and this child bride must be much older than their child; because on the one hand, they can ask her to take care of the underage child, and on the other hand, they can arbitrarily ask her to do some clumsy farm work. "An eighteen-year-old sister comes to a one-year-old boy" - this proverb is spread from there. Our mother-in-law spent thirty taels of silver, according to the rules of "one-year-old, two rites," to buy a fifteen-year-old girl, and that was their family.

The newly arrived child bride was such a clever and shy little girl! She could embroider various vibrant flowers, she could decorate the poor home with wildflowers to make it look like a secluded and peaceful fairyland; she could mend the tattered clothes so neatly and fittingly; in terms of farming skills, she could handle that millstone-sized sieve. This was a task that even men found daunting, but she could make it spin smoothly.

In contrast, her little sister-in-law seemed so lazy and clumsy.

Precisely because the new daughter-in-law was smart, she aroused the jealousy of her little sister-in-law, who often stirred up trouble in front of her mother, making up many lies. The mother-in-law gradually changed from fondness to jealousy and disliked her.

--Don't open your eyes wide and stare at me. What? Do you think it's strange that such a smart and capable little girl lost her mother's favor? In fact, if you lived in that mountain for a year and a half, you wouldn't find it strange. Because it's still like this even now. The facts tell you that the mother-in-law there dislikes the daughter-in-law as commonly as we should eat every day; not to mention that her own daughter uses many lies to slander her every day?

But the young child bride silently endured all these difficulties and ridicule, because she seemed to know that this was an arrangement of fate, an irresistible force formed by nature. She could only try to win a glimmer of sympathy with more diligence and hard work. She became more diligent and hardworking day by day. But jealousy, abuse, and ridicule, these demons stretched out their claws even more sinisterly towards her, forcing her to the end of her life's journey...

She didn't seem to feel the threat of these demons, because in the mountain city, these were too many, too ordinary, and too commonplace. Her only hope was that her little husband would grow up as fast as bamboo shoots, and she could get some warmth and affection from him.

"A thousand-year-old road becomes a river by treading, and a daughter-in-law for many years becomes a mother-in-law," this is the ancient proverb popular in the mountains, giving her enlightenment. She endured hardship and swallowed her tears, patiently waiting for the spring to bloom. But the days seemed to pass even more slowly than in the past. Day by day, the demons' claws gradually stretched out beside her, and some scars of destruction were branded on her body. She looked at her future, vague and elusive, and even living in this world, she felt so bleak and empty. Every time she thought of this, she cried with boundless sorrow.

Day, night, dusk, dawn, on the lightless path of life, she groped in disappointment.

One year, it was time to sow the sesame seeds. In the evening, the mother-in-law gave her and her little sister-in-law each a liter, and asked them to sow it in the fields the next morning.

The jealous and vicious little sister-in-law got up in the middle of the night, put on her clothes, and secretly put the liter of sesame seeds allocated to her sister-in-law in the pot, lighting a red-hot fire; the next morning, they both sowed the liter of sesame seeds allocated to each of them into the fields.

Days passed, and in the sesame field, new goose-yellow buds sprouted on one side, while the other side of the field remained yellow-orange mud.

"Sister-in-law must be a jinx descended from heaven, otherwise? How come she and I sowed the same seeds, but they don't sprout?" the little sister-in-law chattered in front of the mother-in-law every day.

The poor child bride still ran to the field every day to wait patiently, waiting for the sesame sprouts in the ground to grow out of the soil. But the sesame had the same fate as its mistress, subjected to violent destruction, and never had the hope of being born.

The mother-in-law said to others, "If the daughter-in-law is not a jinx descended from heaven, she must be a broom star reincarnated."

Insults, beatings. These were the most familiar things to her.

Finally, on a stormy and rainy night, the child bride sneaked out of the house alone and walked into the depths of the forest.

At this time, she had no scruples, she thanked God for arranging such a final destination for her painful life. She didn't bother with anyone else, everyone in the world hated her, otherwise why didn't her sesame seeds sprout like her little sister-in-law's? Thinking of this, she was not sad about the withering of her youthful flower, she just felt that she had no nostalgia for life, she embraced death happily and painfully. Slowly, her back disappeared into the dark forest.

The next morning, many curious people walked into the forest and gathered around a tree, watching a young girl, hanging straight on the branches. The rain from last night dripped down from her disheveled hair. Kind old women shed tears of sympathy sadly.

It is said that after a person dies, their soul can reveal many unknowable secrets and conspiracies of their lifetime. Our child bride could already know the innocence of her death and the unfortunate encounters of her lifetime. Therefore, her soul unwillingly turned into a bird. Whenever it was the season for sowing sesame seeds, she would fly to the mountains every night and cry mournfully. As for the reason for crying, was it to vent the accumulated resentment in her heart, or to warn some miserable people who shared the same background as her? Or was it to make a heavy accusation against her mother-in-law and little sister-in-law? No one could know.

My story should end here, but similar tragic encounters like the Sesame Bird still thrive like malignant creeping plants in that mountain valley full of feudal ideas.

### An Inch of Mountain and River, an Inch of Blood

— Ye Jingfeng

"You think I have that much power?" This was a feint by Yin Qun.

"At least they all trust you!" Mr. Mai's attitude was very firm.

"Then, why do you feel so interested in them?" Like boxing, after a feint, Yao Qun gave it a Black Tiger Pouncing on the Heart, a punch in the chest. In other words, to make it "show its cards."

"Miss Ji, although we met by chance, we may become lifelong friends in the blink of an eye." It changed to a low and deep tone, like a hypnotist casting a spell; "Let's not talk nonsense in front of real people, believe it or not is up to you..." It paused for a moment, focusing all its attention on Yao Qun's face: "I can be said to be a person without nationality, but I have a 'religion;' this religion is 'sympathy for the weak!'... You can believe me, and we can continue to cooperate, if you don't believe me, we can only part ways!... If I talk any further, I'll still only say these two sentences." It sealed off the most important secret!

Believe it? Just based on its mouthful of crooked and rotten teeth, Yao Qun didn't dare to believe it. However, from these two sentences, especially the four words "sympathy for the weak," Yin Qun roughly figured out its background. Although she wasn't 100% sure, it was pretty close.

"What if you slip up?" Yao Qun took advantage of the situation to probe it again.

"Let me tell you, not to mention these few rascals inside the pass, even the headquarters outside the pass wouldn't dare to touch me; my connections... go way back!"

"Okay!" Yao Qun prepared to take the risk of temporarily using it, but couldn't think of a smooth way to express that although she was cooperating with it, she wouldn't let it catch any handle.

"Don't be indecisive, Miss. I'm going to the 'Action Headquarters' first, and around twelve o'clock, let's go to a restaurant on Nanma Road; bring your nephew with you. Maybe this trip will bring good news...

Yao Qun stopped telling the story of Tianjin here, wondering what she was thinking, and smiled at Little Tiger. With this smile, I finally understood the wonder of her disguise; it turned out that her white teeth were not moved or damaged at all, only some chemical colors were added, yellow, blue, and black, applied to the surface of the teeth. At first glance, it looked like a mouthful of rotten teeth, and with the effect of light, it also looked uneven in length and incomplete.

As for the eyes, eyebrows, nose, and other parts, it seemed that if the positions were moved, only the two emerald eyes had been cut and dyed. Once the eyebrows were changed, the face naturally changed greatly; in addition, she used that what-is-it hair root grass, which made the skin a little swollen, and added some small pustules like fire sores, so it seemed as if the positions had been moved. But after I stared at her for a long time, I felt that her charming outline still existed.

At this time, we were all gathered in Changping again, and she was extremely happy. When she talked about the story of this trip to Tianjin, she forgot her disguise, and her demeanor and actions were still so innocent and lively. I felt that she was not as ugly as she looked at first glance.

"It's also because I'm too nervous," Yin Qun continued: "Thinking that Tiger wouldn't let that transgender person, Mai Shaofu, get away with it, I wanted to find a way to keep them from meeting temporarily. At first, I thought Tiger would come to the hotel, and I could just tell him the situation clearly, let him find another place to live, and communicate secretly. Who knew that after waiting until almost eleven o'clock, there was no sign of him, so I had to hurry up and think of a way before the guy came back?... Cormorant Raft (Guilin Scenery) Chen Shuren

### The Brilliant Science of Today

— Zhang Dayan

Looking forward to the future, the progress of science is the most admirable and joyful thing; but the rapid progress of science today makes it difficult to predict; there are indeed many beautiful and moving, amazing achievements that do not have to wait until tomorrow to be seen, and they are growing in the scientific field today.

The application of atomic energy is undoubtedly the most brilliant part of tomorrow's science, and electronics has also made equally great achievements today, especially in the field of ultra-short waves. It has made it possible for us to communicate with the moon, and has also brought the most wonderful and useful tool—the electron microscope, which has given the greatest help to all scientific and industrial research, allowing mankind to see the tiny world that was previously invisible. The 30,000-fold magnification of the electron microscope makes optical instruments that magnify 1,000 times and ultraviolet microscopes that magnify 3,000 times seem insignificant. Here, scientists are beginning to truly and practically observe the work of material molecules. It has also opened up new horizons for bacteriology and metallography, becoming the most effective tool in today's science.

Great success will also be the fight between mankind and disease. Advanced sulfa-drugs, penicillin, and synthetic anti-malarials have saved many diseases from famous doctors. But there are still many deadly diseases, and the work of scientists still cannot be relaxed in the slightest.

Recently, among the 2,000 possible combinations of sulfa-drugs, in addition to the five that have already been applied, the rest are in the process of being imitated, manufactured, and tested; the other four types of penicillin, penicillin FGK and X, are being extracted from 50,000 types of green mold for application. The rapid discovery and manufacture of many drugs will keep pharmacologists, biologists, and physicians busy for many years from now.

The petroleum industry is the most important industry for mankind, but in the past, we still only had two simple methods—heating and steaming. However, industrial scientists have long pointed out that different molecular organizations have a great impact on the quality of gasoline. Whether used in cars or airplanes, gasoline containing more octane has the best volatility and can avoid the most annoying knocking phenomenon in internal combustion engines (this is because gasoline ignition and spontaneous ignition and explosion coexist, so they collide with each other, generating a pressure of more than 1,000 pounds per square inch, which endangers the engine. High-quality gasoline can withstand high compression without spontaneous combustion.)

Therefore, many new procedures such as hydrogenation, catalytic cracking, allotropic transformation, and multi-base procedures have been added today to obtain the appropriate molecular organization and improve the engine's economy and safety.

What is most unclear and analyzed by the general public is the use of plastics and synthetic rubber as our useful materials. Although it also has many shortcomings and cannot be used to make a completely "glass" car or machine, it is more suitable than other materials for some uses. Recently, the ignition system inside cars has adopted this type of raw material, which is very suitable. In terms of temperature resistance, there has also been improvement, and it can now withstand various temperatures from 75 degrees to 500 degrees Fahrenheit. A material called "fiber glass" is a good material for solving the insulation problem of generators and motors.

Modern science has given the metallurgical industry abundant vitality, making this science, which has been studied since ancient times, always moving, because our requirements for all metal materials are never satisfied. We need its load-bearing capacity to increase day by day, hoping that it can control the vast atomic energy. The importance of the responsibility is not difficult to imagine; ultra-high-speed flight requires not only high strength and high performance, but also lightness. Everything requires further metallurgical research.

X-ray photography makes the observation method in metallurgy a specialized field of knowledge, and electron microscopes allow scientists to observe the organization of molecules. These are the driving forces that enable the quality of today's thousands of alloys and alloy steels to bear heavy responsibilities.

Huge wings, the latest machinery, such as electronic bombers and electron microscopes, are not all made of "human materials"?

Yes, the beautiful and moving world is not only in the future, but also today. Look at the brilliant flowers in the scientific field, which are blooming under the diligent irrigation of scientists!

### Energy

— Zhu Xuerun

"Energy" has a very close relationship with everything we come into contact with in our daily lives. For example, household appliances such as electric lights and electric stoves use a kind of "electrical energy" to convert it into "light" or "heat" energy, making it very convenient for us to enjoy; of course, others are just the same, continuously using "energy," and applying "energy." Therefore, knowledge of "energy" can enable people to learn from daily life experiences and achieve it through learning; but it is necessary to have basic knowledge.

The most obvious and most perceptible "energy" is a kind of "mechanical energy." --If you push an object hard with your hand, then this object, if it is stationary, will start to move in the direction you push it, and the object will only stop after a considerable distance. --If we talk about the law of "mechanical energy"; because according to Newton's second law of motion, when an object is in a stationary state, if its mass is m, after being impacted, it has the ability to move at a speed (F-=m.v), and if an object has a speed (V), it has a kind of "kinetic energy" (K.E.=1/2mv2); once it has "kinetic energy," if it is not affected by other external forces, the object will always retain this "energy," in other words, the object will always maintain its original speed and move continuously, but in fact, it is affected by air resistance and other forces, such as friction, as a result, the object stops. But the object has already moved (S=1/2mv2.1/F) to your destination.

The throat can make sounds because the vocal cords vibrate violently, and at this time, the surrounding air already has a kind of "wave energy," which spreads outward, and then touches the eardrum; so our daily ears rely on "energy" in the air to transmit sounds.

Strike a match. --Because of the mutual friction between substances, a considerable amount of "heat" is generated, and as a result, a very bright flame is produced. You must know that "heat" is a kind of "energy," and when this kind of "heat energy" is converted into another kind of "light wave energy," the match head starts to "burn." But what is "light wave energy"? What is "burning"?... The reason why we "see" a burning torch is that the "light wave energy" can be transmitted to, and at the same time, through our eyes, it stimulates the retina and causes a sense of light. The embers of the match, of course, are carbon and other impurities, however, a branch is burned into carbon and other substances, which belongs to the change of "chemical energy."

From the above, it seems that there are many kinds of "energy," but there are many kinds of "energy," there are also "potential energy," "electrical energy," and "atomic energy." However, there is a question, where does "energy" come from, and why has it been used for tens of thousands of years and it is still not used up?

The sun's "radiation energy" is projected onto the earth's surface, and various objects absorb it, and at the same time, it is transformed into various kinds of "energy." During the process of radiation shining on the earth, some parts are scattered by gas and become diffuse light, and because of the unevenness of diffuse reflection, the heating of various parts of the ground is also uneven, so there is a difference in pressure in the atmosphere, and thus the formation of wind. Usually, using wind to replace human power, such as sailboats and windmills, is applying the "energy" of the sun. Often, radiation shines on the water surface of rivers and seas, evaporating water vapor, and then encountering cold air currents in the sky, and thus forming dew, snow, frost, and hail falling to the ground, because the cold air currents have a range, so a certain area has a "potential energy" of high water level, and when the water flows down to the surrounding lower water levels, it becomes "kinetic energy."

### Artificial Snow

— Bao Zhongqi

When you are bored, readers can make artificial snow at home, which is both interesting and rich in scientific meaning. You may wish to try it. Utensils: a box of safety matches, a silver coin, a small amount of iodine, and a flash. Environment: a tightly closed place with cold air, preferably with black walls as a background, so that the small snowflakes can be easily displayed.

Steps: Dip a drop of wine on the match head. Rub it on the silver coin, and a small amount of silver will stick to the match head. Strike the match, and when it burns, the smoke will contain extremely fine silver iodide crystals.

In cold air (below ten degrees Fahrenheit), blow on it, and the temperature of the exhaled water vapor will drop sharply. The water vapor is between the silver iodide particles, and under the illumination of the flash, bright snowflakes will appear. It is difficult to reach a temperature below ten degrees Fahrenheit in ordinary room temperature. You can try one of the following: In a household food freezer;

Use a large empty bottle! Surround it with a large wooden barrel filled with dry ice to lower its temperature (be careful not to touch the dry ice directly with your hands); On cold winter nights, in a tightly closed car or similar situation. The snow made in this way is quite cold to watch indoors. Therefore, you can use this "kinetic energy" (also called water power) to generate electricity, and "constant energy" can be converted into "mechanical energy" to supply factories and transportation needs.

When plants receive the projected radiation, photosynthesis occurs, which can absorb carbon dioxide in the air and decompose it into "air," and at the same time, carbon is the main component of the body, so the "heat" and "light" obtained when burning wood are nothing but the reappearance of "solar energy," so the growth of plants, from the perspective of "energy," is the function of transforming "solar energy" into "chemical energy" and storing it. Animals live on plants and the air they produce as nutritional raw materials, so "solar energy" is also transferred into animal bodies; as mentioned in the previous paragraphs, "pushing objects with your hand," "striking a match," "vibrating vocal cords," and "listening to sounds" are all people using the "solar energy" they have obtained. Thinking back to ancient times, the remains of animals and plants in the strata have become today's various minerals; therefore, the "energy" of minerals is nothing more than the "energy" accumulated when the ancient times projected on the ground. It can be seen that all the phenomena on the ground mostly come from the sun's emission, and all "energy" can be classified into "energy," but it is often changing "her" face, and it will never be reduced. Of course, if the sun's "energy" is exhausted, the earth will no longer receive "solar energy," and at that time, humans will no longer be able to survive on the earth. Therefore, we can make full use of the "energy" possessed by all substances on the ground, for example: During World War II, Germany discovered that using the vapor of liquid fuel and gasoline as a propellant resulted in the emergence of the terrifying V-2 rocket. The United States adopted the principle of transforming "atomic energy" into many other "energies" and produced the atomic bomb that shook the world. The power of "energy" is indeed worthy of the name, so can we, living in this scientific age of the twentieth century, still ignorantly ignore this "energy"?

### Atomic Energy Will Lead to Human Extinction

— Yang Shi

In the September issue of the "Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists," Dr. Hermann J. Muller of Indiana University warned that even if atomic bombs don't destroy millions of people, humanity will slowly and unconsciously be destroyed by atomic energy. Professor Muller, the winner of last year's Nobel Prize in Biology, believes, based on experiments, that the atomic energy used in peacetime will cause mutations in the genetic material within cells, making reproduction impossible and endangering the extinction of the human race.

The reproductive cells of humans, animals, and plants all contain tiny particles (genes). When these genes are altered or destroyed, "mutations" occur. These mutations can be so severe that they render the next generation infertile. Usually, these mutations lie dormant within the cells, combining with mutated genes from the opposite sex during reproduction, eventually revealing their effects. Dr. Muller won the prize because he irradiated the sex organs of fruit flies with "X-rays," resulting in the birth of many deformed offspring. This proves that "X-rays" can destroy fertility. However, fruit flies have short lifespans, so the adverse effects are quickly apparent. In humans, it may take hundreds or thousands of years to manifest. But Dr. Muller believes that by then, every descendant will suffer from the ancient damage, either dying or losing the ability to reproduce, leading to the complete destruction of humanity.

He often said that doctors can easily shield the sex organs from "X-rays" to prevent the destruction of fertility, but the danger of atomic energy far exceeds that of X-rays. It also contains "Gamma rays." When an atomic bomb explodes, it directly kills hundreds of thousands of people and also plants the seeds of this "gene mutation" poison in the survivors. This is passed down generation after generation, eventually destroying all of humanity. The same is true for peacetime use of atomic energy. Therefore, Dr. Muller loudly appeals that once atomic energy can be directly and extensively used, how to eliminate and prevent these accompanying radioactive rays is a problem that urgently needs to be solved today. In the past, simply using lead screens to shield human reproductive organs from X-rays is clearly not enough now. What's even more terrifying is that this harm is too slow and difficult to detect, and its adverse effects only appear years later. As a result, people generally neglect this terrible enemy of humanity. They must realize that this small impact will combine and expand repeatedly, generation after generation, until the "mutation" completely destroys the human reproductive system. Only then to take preventive measures will be too late.

### Is Mutation a Chemical Change? (Continued)

— Hao Tianhe

After a genetic analysis of the lethal genes produced in the first CIB experiment, it was discovered that some of these lethal genes were caused by the rearrangement of chromosomes. This was confirmed by Dr. Slizynski through cytological examination. Chromosomal rearrangement caused by mustard gas stimulation has become a matter of course. In December 1941, another special experiment was conducted. Their designed method focused on the translocation of chromosome positions. For example, two colored chromosomes exchange a part with each other. However, automatic exchange is rare under normal circumstances, but mustard gas undoubtedly has the power to cause chromosomal rearrangement. Among the 816 cell nuclei tested, seven had translocations. A report on the results of this experiment was submitted to the War Department in March 1943. However, all similar work could not be published at that time because mustard gas was a kind of poison gas and related to the war. Later, many more experiments were conducted on chromosomal translocation and other forms of rearrangement. All of this research used fruit flies as further material, which is worth noting. In 1943, Dr. Koller applied the pollen mother cells of Tradescantia Virginica to cytological research and completely confirmed that mustard gas can cause chromosome breakage and rearrangement.

The effects of mustard gas and X-rays on heredity are quite similar, which is obvious. However, it is still possible to find certain differences between these two effects. These differences may be very interesting because comparing chemical and physical mutagens may offer more hope of understanding the problem of mutation. The first difference was found in the phenomenon of translocation. The rate of occurrence of lethal genes caused by X-rays and the rate of occurrence of translocations caused by X-rays both increased directly with the intensity of the rays. The translocation rate is equivalent to the 3/2th power of the light intensity. As a result, under a certain intensity of X-rays (calculated in Roentgen units), a numerical relationship was established between the number of lethal genes and translocations. At 3,000 Roentgen units of X-rays, nearly 9 percent of sex-linked lethal genes and nearly 6 percent of translocations can be produced. These translocations are between the second and third chromosomes of fruit flies. After treatment with mustard gas, this quantitative relationship significantly shifted towards sex-linked lethal genes. In the mustard gas experiment, it was originally expected that there would be 6 percent translocations, but now there are only 0.5 percent translocations occurring between the second and third chromosomes. The sex-linked lethal genes produced in this experiment were still 9 percent. In subsequent experiments, it was found that the percentage of translocations also decreased in the same proportion. This observation seems to indicate that mustard gas is not as effective at breaking chromosomes as X-rays, but to draw this conclusion, careful consideration is needed. It must be remembered that the methods we use cannot yet explore the exact situation of chromosome breakage. Now we can only know the proportion of rearrangements. We can speculate that after that kind of chemical treatment, it may hinder the steps of chromosome fragment rearrangement. Therefore, since there is a certain number of fragments, the number after the completion of rearrangement will be less than that after X-ray machine treatment. Special experiments are still needed to prove this point before a conclusion can be drawn. Social Services

### Two Explanations on Military Service Issues Answered by the Third Section of the Shanghai Civil Affairs Bureau

(Question) A person's original residence is in place A, and their registered residence is in place B. Both places have registered households. For military service, should they be conscripted from their original residence or their registered residence? (Answer) According to the provisions of the Military Service Law, a man serves one military service, in principle, in his original residence. If he wishes to fulfill his military service obligations in his registered residence, he should report in advance to the local Baojia in his current residence, and report to the county (city) government, which will notify the county (city) government of his original residence, and inform the Baojia of his original residence to avoid duplication. Otherwise, the township of the original residence should provide a certificate that the person has been dealt with by the conscription of the original residence, and transfer it to the Bao of the current residence for verification and cancellation. (Question) If a family settlement fee for soldiers has already been paid in the original residence, can the family settlement fee and consolation money for soldiers in the registered residence be waived? (Answer) The city currently levies two types of preferential treatment fees: one is paid by conscripted soldiers, and the other is paid by households without soldiers enlisting. The preferential treatment fee payable by conscripted soldiers does not need to be paid if the conscription is not handled by the city. The second type does not need to be paid if it is an individual. As for the consolation money for enlisting soldiers currently being raised by the District Bao, it is based on the clear order of the Municipal Government Military Service Association to organize the District Bao to send off volunteer soldiers to the camp. The objects of raising consolation money vary depending on the environment of each District Bao, sometimes targeting soldiers and sometimes targeting affluent households. (See the "Clarification of Doubts about Encouraging Volunteer Soldiers' Consolation Money" published in the 13th and 16th days of this month's column.)

### Answered by the Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau

[Summary] This column answers questions once every Saturday. Letters are limited to questions related to telecommunications business. Please indicate "Telecommunications Business" on your letter. The text should be concise and to the point. Please write your real name and address in your letter. We may reply directly by letter if necessary.

(Shi Guoguang from Tongren Road asks) How many types of private telegrams are there? (Answer) Private telegrams are divided into ordinary = P, urgent = D, social = SLT, news = Z, urgent news = DZ, and express telegram = L. Regardless of whether it is a private or organizational group, all telegrams sent that do not meet the regulations of military telegrams, official telegrams, and other types of private telegrams shall be treated as ordinary telegrams. The Bureau receives mostly ordinary telegrams, so the calculation of the prices of various telegrams is based on the price of ordinary telegrams. If the sender wants to send it in advance, he can send an urgent telegram. The fee is doubled. A "急" (urgent) or "D" can be written on the telegram, and an additional word is calculated. Social telegrams refer to greetings, thanks, etc. News telegrams must be approved by the Ministry of Communications and issued with a news license before they can be sent. Express telegrams are for special business purposes, and only telecommunications bureaus that have opened express telegram services can receive and send them. (Li Jingshan from Hongkou asks) I have opened a grocery store and now want to install a commercial telephone. Can I apply? What are the procedures and prices? Commercial telephones are difficult to install due to the provisions of Article 1 of the promulgated amended municipal telephone restriction measures.

Lost and Found Jin Jieguodong and others went to school from home a few days ago and picked up a gold ring near the new garbage tree. They did not see anyone looking for it at the time and could not return it. Now, they have specially enclosed the ring and sent it to the museum, praying for disclosure, so that the loser can claim it. Otherwise, they will listen to your newspaper's donation to any charitable cause to promote public welfare. Respectfully to the Social Services Column of Shen Bao, Shao Guodong and Zhang Rongzu, sixth-grade students of Huzhou Shanghai Primary School, October 14th
