### Significance of the Executive Yuan Reorganization is to Trial the Responsibility System, Zhang Qun's Address at the Political Affairs Meeting

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 29th dispatch] President of the Executive Yuan, Zhang Qun, stated at the first Political Affairs Meeting on the morning of the 29th that the significance of this reorganization of the Executive Yuan is to trial the Executive Yuan's responsibility system, and that the Executive Yuan should be collectively responsible hereafter. The collective resignation of all the incumbent ministers and heads of departments of the Executive Yuan this time, plus the new appointments, is an example of expressing this spirit. The discussion of the Executive Yuan's Rules of Procedure then began. Regarding Article 6, which concerns matters that should be decided by the Executive Yuan's meeting, various committee members spoke one after another. As a result, the majority believed that the rules were established based on Article 26 of the National Government Organization Law and did not need to be amended; however, an explanation was added to the resolution, which was passed without objection. Then the discussion of various proposals continued. After the discussion, Zhang Qun gave another brief speech, the main points of which are as follows: First, it is hoped that the various ministries and commissions will improve administrative efficiency, and it is announced that the time for receiving official business will be from 9:00 AM to 10:00 AM for meeting with senior officials within the Executive Yuan, from 10:00 AM to 11:30 AM for various ministries and commissions to discuss official business, and from 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM for various provinces and cities to discuss official business, excluding meeting times. The remaining time will be spent reading official documents and not receiving guests in order to save time and improve efficiency. Second, in the future, review meetings will be held with various ministries and commissions at another fixed time each week to exchange opinions in the form of a meeting report. Third, in the future, unimportant proposals do not need to be submitted to the Executive Yuan meeting for discussion, and the Executive Yuan meeting should focus on the decision of important policies. Fourth, in the future, national budget proposals should all be submitted to the Executive Yuan meeting for discussion so that everyone can understand them and be jointly responsible; although the President of the Executive Yuan has the power to handle the payment of funds for the promulgation of emergency orders, special attention should be paid to them, and it is best to complete the legal bill first.

(2) The case that the Chairman of the National Government should be responsible to the National Assembly for the Constitution. The discussion lasted a long time, and the committee members expressed their opinions very enthusiastically. Ren Zhuoxuan and Sun Mujia repeatedly spoke, emphasizing that although the current government is not elected, it is a government preparing to implement the constitution, so the Chairman of the National Government should be responsible to the National Assembly. However, Sun Ke explained that the National Assembly for the Constitution seems to be limited by time, because in fact, the elected president is produced after the National Assembly for the Constitution. If it is only limited to the National Assembly for the Constitution, then the president's responsibility during this transition period will have no object. Therefore, the two words "for the Constitution" should be deleted. It was then passed and submitted to the joint meeting for decision before advising the government. Following the passage of (3) Rotating committee members to go to various places to carry out propaganda, dispatched in batches from May 15, submitted to the joint meeting for decision.

The reporter visited him at 5:00 PM and he gave the following statement: "I left Nanjing two years before the Republic of China and it has been 38 years since then. Now I am summoned to Beijing, and the separation has been reunited. The mountains and rivers are still the same, and everything is full of new atmosphere, and I feel very happy in my heart. The Sichuan and Kang areas are currently very stable, and all important policies are being implemented smoothly. Since President Zhang went to Chengdu last time and convened a security meeting to launch a total suppression of bandits, the giant bandits Shuai Pengzhang and Yin Luozi, who have plagued southern Sichuan for many years, have been killed one after another. The defense of northeastern Sichuan is also very solid. The economic construction of Sichuan has long been the focus of attention of the people of the country. Since the central government has designated Sichuan as an experimental province, the Sichuan Provincial Five-Year Construction Plan has also been approved and is now being actively promoted, such as the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway and the Dujiangyan Hydropower Project, and we are working hard to see its early completion. The only problem is that Sichuan's financial resources are limited. In order to achieve complete completion, we must rely on collective wisdom and efforts. In the future, we will ask the central government for instructions and step up the handling. During the War of Resistance, many people from various provinces came to Sichuan and made many contributions to Sichuan's economic and cultural undertakings. I hope that they will be supported and guided at any time in the future so that they can be successful!" Deng is scheduled to meet with Minister Bai Chongxi at 6:00 PM tonight and visit President Zhang Qun at 9:00 PM to discuss various issues related to Sichuan's politics, and will also visit Chairman Chiang to report on the military and political situation in Sichuan in the coming days.

The Mengyin people, who had been ravaged and oppressed by the communist army for seven years, were liberated by the National Army one day and saw people again. Men, women, old and young, were all overjoyed and crazy, so they all automatically assisted the National Army in repairing roads, organizing Baojia, and establishing security.

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 29th] The Price Committee of the National Economic Commission held its fifth meeting at 3 PM on the 29th, chaired by Mr. Qiang. Gu Zhenggang, Xu Kan, Yu Hongjun, Wang Yunwu, Wu Guozhen, Zhang Jiaji, Shen Yi, and others attended. First, Xie Zhengfu, Director of the Beijing Municipal Social Bureau, reported on the in-kind distribution situation for public and educational personnel in Beijing. Then, Pang Songzhou, Deputy Director of the Food Department, and Wu Guozhen, Mayor of Shanghai, reported on the rice prices and food supply situation in Beijing and Shanghai. Wang Yunwu, Zhang Jiaji, and Wu Weijing, a representative of the China Textile Company, reported on the cotton yarn distribution situation in Shanghai. Subsequently, they discussed subsidies for rice, cotton, and public utilities. The following resolutions were passed for each case: (1) Cotton yarn will still adopt price control measures, with a limit of 4.6 million per piece. The government will not calculate profits when purchasing, still using 4.6 million as the standard. (2) Subsidies for public utilities in Beijing and Shanghai will still follow the subsidy method of March and April, with an appropriate increase in the amount. (3) No results were obtained from the discussion of the rice and grain issue. Regarding the student public rice issue, the municipal government and school authorities will discuss and find appropriate solutions to ensure adequate supply.

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 29th] It is learned that in addition to deciding on the distribution of public rice for students, the Price Committee has also decided that newspapers can enjoy the benefit of distribution. That is, all organizations with a large number of employees can follow suit. The reason is to avoid direct purchases from the market and stimulate prices. It is also learned that the purchase of military rice can be done in cities in the future. Therefore, it is observed that rice prices can be stabilized after this measure. It is also learned that the standard for increasing subsidies for public utilities in Shanghai is to appropriately increase coal, transportation, and other industries by 10%. Beijing remains the same.

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 29th] The Price Committee is scheduled to hold another meeting at 10 AM on the 30th to discuss the rice and grain issue. Wu Guozhen and others will return to Shanghai after the meeting.

[Our Correspondent in Suzhou, 29th] The Suzhou rice market is even more chaotic today. Although the black market has risen to 220,000 yuan per shi (unit of dry measure), some rice shops are still refusing to sell retail. At around 8 AM, Xie Yuan Rice Shop on Daoqian Street was surrounded and questioned by over a hundred people for insisting on refusing to sell rice. Fortunately, the local police station intervened appropriately, preventing a disturbance.

### Chen Lifu Discusses Principles of Price Stabilization

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 29th] Chen Lifu, Secretary-General of the Central Political Committee, told reporters on the 29th that the principles for stabilizing prices are approximately the following two points: (1) Increase production to equalize supply, and the government should provide low-interest loans, ensuring that the recipients are producers, rather than allowing the loans to flow into hoarding raw materials, creating the opposite result. (2) Avoid all actions that stimulate prices. For example, the recent issuance of 10,000-yuan banknotes will not actually affect prices, but merchants are using this as an excuse to stir up trouble. Therefore, I believe it is best to avoid all facts that could stimulate price increases.

### Far Eastern Commission Meets on May 5th Discussing Percentage of Reparations US Demands that All Countries State Their Opinions

[Central News Agency, Washington, 28th] It was learned here today that the Far Eastern Commission will hold a meeting on May 5th, attempting to reach an agreement on the percentage of Japanese reparations. According to authoritative sources, the United States has been striving in the past few weeks to have the representatives of the eleven countries on the committee state the percentage of reparations their country hopes for, and express their opinions on the percentage that other countries should receive. Due to General MacArthur's repeated urging, the United States has made a final decision on the reparations issue and has now asked all countries to state their opinions in order to break the current deadlock. Diplomatic observers are not very optimistic about the outcome of future meetings. They privately say that if they do not compromise on the reparations demands of the United States, China, and other countries, a final agreement cannot be reached. Diplomats said that the United States is now willing to allow each country to retain all Japanese assets within its borders, but these assets must be deducted from their final demands. If the meeting starting on May 5th still results in a deadlock, the United States can issue interim instructions to General MacArthur, ordering him to distribute additional preliminary reparations to the countries demanding reparations, just as it recently ordered General MacArthur to distribute 30% of existing assets to China, the Philippines, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom.

[Associated Press, Washington, 28th] The Reparations Subcommittee of the Far Eastern Commission discussed procedural issues today. A spokesman for the committee said that the reparations issue was not involved. The next meeting is scheduled for next week.

### Philippines Opposes Overseas Chinese Returning to the Philippines Immigration Bureau Insists Most Strongly

[Associated Press, Manila, 29th] According to authoritative sources today, the reason why 7,600 Chinese people who lived in the Philippines before their jobs are being prevented from re-entering the islands is due to the opposition of the Philippine government. (Note: These Chinese people were transported back to China from the Philippines by the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) in 1945 as displaced persons.) It is said that the Director of the Immigration Bureau, Fabre, is the main figure opposing the return of Chinese people to the Philippines. He believes that the large number of Chinese coming to the Philippines is not in line with the current immigration policy and will increase economic difficulties. He also listed various reasons such as the severity of housing and food problems, the surge in living expenses, and the increase in unemployment.

### Advisor to Chinese Delegation to Far Eastern Commission Yang Yunzhu to Depart for the United States Today Conversed Freely with Reporters Yesterday About Various Matters Concerning Japan

[Our Report] Yang Yunzhu, Minister-level Advisor to the Chinese Delegation to the Far Eastern Commission, arrived in Shanghai on the 26th and was suddenly summoned back to Nanjing by the Chairman for instructions. Mr. Yang returned to Shanghai the night before last and is scheduled to depart for the United States today on the General Gordon. Before his departure, he met with reporters and said that he will be in the United States for about a year. When passing through Japan, he will consult with the Chinese delegation to Japan to collect the necessary information for use during the Far Eastern Commission's meetings. The focus of China's handling of the Japanese issue is in Tokyo and Washington, D.C., and he will work to strengthen the close ties between the two places.

Japanese Reparations Issue

Regarding the Japanese reparations issue, Mr. Yang believes that China currently has two important tasks: one is the utilization of the first batch of relocated materials. This batch of materials is only 480,000 tons, but it already requires 400 billion national currency in transportation costs, plus tens of millions of US dollars to purchase parts. It is not easy to obtain, so we should think about how to maximize its use. The second is to solve the problem of Japan's total reparations, which should be studied first and a detailed plan should be established. At the London Foreign Ministers Conference in the 34th year of the Republic (1945), Foreign Minister Wang Jingwei proposed two principles: (1) China should obtain the largest percentage, and (2) China should have priority in compensation. At that time, the United Kingdom and the United States warmly supported it, and France and the Soviet Union had no different opinions. Therefore, China is in an advantageous position when implementing the total reparations plan. As for the recent US proposal that China receive 45% of the temporary reparations, Mr. Yang said that the official has not yet received a formal report, and this matter may need to be handled after Secretary of State Marshall returns to the United States. Before the meeting in Moscow, China originally hoped that the United States and the Soviet Union would compromise so that the European reparations issue could be completed smoothly, as a basis for the Japanese reparations method. Now things have gone awry, and judging from the current situation, the complete resolution of the Japanese reparations issue may take two years.

Production Level Issue

When discussing the issue of determining Japan's production level, Mr. Yang pointed out that there are two types of production levels: one is the "peacetime economic level," which is the maximum limit for Japan's future recovery. The Allied Council for Japan has decided to adopt the average figures from 1931 to 1934. The second is the "industrial production level," which refers to the figure guaranteed to be maintained during the implementation of reparations, that is, Japan's existing maximum production capacity. This has not yet been decided, and everything is open for discussion.

Peace Treaty Signing Issue

As for the signing of a peace treaty with Japan, someone in General MacArthur's headquarters has suggested that China should actively prepare now, strive for initiative, and prepare a draft treaty as early as possible. When the peace treaty can be signed depends largely on the shift in the European situation. Whether the procedure for concluding the peace treaty is to first resolve the issues of demilitarization and reparations before signing it has not been decided. All of these are the main topics for future discussions by the Far Eastern Commission.

### Fisheries Representatives from Various Provinces and Cities Demand Prevention of Japanese Fishing Boats from Intruding Urge the Navy to Send Ships to Patrol the Coast

### United States Donates Large Number of Warships Helping to Build Our Navy Acting Commander-in-Chief Gui Talks to Reporters

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 29th] Gui Yongqing, Acting Commander-in-Chief of the Navy, told reporters on the morning of the 29th that the United States' donation of 271 warships to us is sufficient to promote the success of the construction of our new navy. The naval authorities have not yet received formal notification from the US regarding this matter, but they believe that it will soon be learned through diplomatic channels. The United States' donation of warships to China was decided last year and is a confirmed case. Our entire past training plan was formulated in preparation for receiving the ships. When the first batch of US warships can arrive is still unknown until formal notification is received. In terms of preparation work, the main one is naval training. Currently, we have about 600 naval personnel in the United Kingdom, and there are also a considerable number in the United States. The most important naval school in China is the Qingdao Training Corps. The equipment there is excellent. The first batch of ship receiving personnel has graduated from training, and training will continue in the future. The greatest need in China at present is for mid- and lower-level officers, especially junior officers and non-commissioned officers. After the US warships arrive in China, some of the old ships will be scrapped so that the original personnel can be transferred to serve on the new ships. In addition, the authorities are also paying special attention to naval treatment and welfare. Equally important as training is port management. The authorities are actively carrying this out. The Qingdao harbor has good construction. The Zuoying naval defense remains to be completed. The Hainan Island base is also being planned. Gui concluded by saying: Although the construction of the navy is not without difficulties, the future is very promising. When asked about the recent situation of the Xisha Islands, Gui replied that he had recently sent people to the islands and brought many mobile houses to strengthen the arrangements.

As for the losses of the newspapers, Gao Tiejun, a provincial senator from Wuhu, is responsible for requesting compensation from the authorities. The three newspapers were satisfied and resumed publication on the 25th.

Jiaxing

On the afternoon of the 27th, more than a hundred silkworm farmers from the Seventh Bao of Xinpu Township protested to the county government, led by Township Head Lu, because the Yunnan Huashan silkworm seeds (issued by the County Cooperative Union) were not developing uniformly and many had died, requesting relief.

### Editorial The Path to World Peace

——After Reading Secretary of State Marshall's Speech——

After returning to the United States from Moscow, Secretary of State Marshall delivered a broadcast speech to the people of the country on the 28th, reporting on the proceedings of the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference, so that every American could gain a correct understanding. After the close of the Moscow Conference, American political and diplomatic figures, relying on the news reported by news agencies and newspapers, were unwilling to comment on the success or failure of the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference until Secretary of State Marshall returned home to report. In fact, we have the same feeling. Now, after listening to Secretary of State Marshall's long speech, we can better understand the crux of the failure of the Moscow Conference.

We summarize Secretary of State Marshall's speech, and its main points are as follows: (1) The failure of the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference was due to the Soviet Union's use of the Foreign Ministers Conference to incite popular enthusiasm and prejudice, rather than appealing to reason and understanding. (2) The so-called German question can be analyzed into the following five issues: (1) the scope of authority of the German central government; (2) the nature of the German economic system and its relationship with European countries; (3) the nature and scope of German reparations; (4) the German border issue; (5) the procedure for drafting the German peace treaty and the manner of its approval. (3) The reason why the United States cannot compromise on issues of great importance is because it does not want to "establish an agreement for the sake of an agreement." (4) On April 15, Marshal Stalin told him that the main issues discussed at the Moscow Conference, such as disarmament, political organization, reparations, and economic unification, could all be compromised; but at this time, there was still a need for patience and to avoid pessimism. (5) Marshal Marshall sincerely hopes that the views expressed by Stalin are correct, and that the Soviet representatives will fully demonstrate their spirit of cooperation when attending the next international conference.

From this, it can be seen that although Marshal Marshall also acknowledged the failure of the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference, the torch of hope is still burning in his heart. On the one hand, he hopes that the Soviet Union can fully demonstrate its spirit of cooperation at the next international conference, so that the main issues on which countries have different opinions can be compromised; on the other hand, he asks the American people to take united action to fulfill the tasks that the United States bears to the world. If both the United States and the Soviet Union can realize Secretary of State Marshall's ideals, it will not be difficult to dispel the clouds and mists shrouding the skies of the two countries and reveal the sunlight of peace and democracy. Therefore, Marshal Marshall's speech not only explained the current world situation but also pointed out a path to world peace. No matter from which angle we observe the general trend of the world, we attach great importance to and should study Marshal Marshall's wise and insightful instructions.

In today's world, it can be said that there is no one who does not seek peace! No one who does not desire peace! It's just that the methods and paths to be taken to create world peace vary. For example, between the United States and the Soviet Union, who does not want peace! But the paths taken by the two countries are running in opposite directions. The Soviet Union seeks to expand its so-called "security zone" and wants to erect an "iron curtain" around it, creating another world; while the United States wants to maintain the secret of atomic energy and the military bases scattered throughout the world, and wants to use gold and money as the backing of its diplomacy to create a common front to prevent the expansion of totalitarian forces. Therefore, the opinions of both sides on any issue always run in opposite directions. Leaving this aside, even within the United States itself, who does not long for peace to be realized as soon as possible; but opinions on how to win peace are not entirely the same, and there are considerable distances between them. For example, President Truman said in a speech to the Democratic National Convention on April 5: "The United States has an unshirkable responsibility to create world peace; therefore, it should bear the responsibility of assisting the freedom of people of all countries when they are in danger. In order to fulfill this responsibility, the United States must maintain sufficient military strength to make all countries in the world believe that the United States is determined to act in accordance with its responsibilities." President Truman's views can be regarded as the foundation of American policy; and all recent American activities in the international arena are based on this as a guideline. The second is Wallace, who has been the most vocal opponent of American policy, and has recently traveled to European countries, giving speeches everywhere. Although he also spoke of the urgency of the American people's desire for peace, he firmly opposes the Truman Doctrine, and even claims that President Truman's aid to Greece and Turkey plan is enough to lead to the division of the world and the outbreak of World War III. He advocates understanding with the Soviet Union and requests the government to lend money to the Soviet Union to help it build a socialist country. In addition, there is also a Republican presidential candidate, Stetson, who, after touring sixteen European countries, returned home and said: "If the United States can remain strong and adopt policies that are conducive to world powers, then world peace can be maintained for at least thirty years." This is Stetson's conclusion after inspecting the European continent. These three opinions can represent the views of three aspects of the United States, but which path will the United States ultimately take to create world peace?

After listening to Secretary of State Marshall's broadcast speech, we can analyze and derive the following new trends in the European policy that the United States will adopt in the future. (1) The United States will actively assist Greece and Turkey; (2) Fully utilize the resources of the Ruhr and Silesia regions to stabilize the European economy, so that the European continent will also become an economic unit; (3) Continue to control Germany to make it a peaceful and democratic country; (4) Unify western Germany. After the economic merger of the British and American occupation zones, they will be politically merged, and France is welcome to participate; (5) Strive for French support. The de Gaulle faction has launched the French People's Union movement in France, which is obviously encouraged by this American policy.

Can the United States adopt this policy to promote peace in Europe? No one can give a definite answer, and even President Truman and Secretary of State Marshall of the United States are not sure. However, we believe that the people of all countries in the world are so eager for peace that the wishes of all mankind will eventually be realized one day. Marshal Marshall asked the American people to understand the views of other countries so that these complex and intricate problems can be solved concretely and definitively, which is the only path for the United States to move towards world peace. Conversely, we have no other excessive demands on the Soviet Union, but we hope that it can also be like the United States, appealing to conscience and reason on all international issues, so that prejudice and fanaticism cannot arise, and any difficult problems will not be difficult to solve.

In short, we expect that both the United States and the Soviet Union can take the path to world peace. The Director of the Fisheries Administration Announces Guarantee Measures

[United Press Washington, 28th Dispatch] Secretary of State Marshall recently condemned the Soviet Union for causing the Moscow Conference to fail, but also revealed that Stalin believed that compromise was possible on important issues concerning Germany. In his broadcast speech to the nation reporting on the proceedings of the Moscow Conference, Marshall said: On April 15, I went to the Kremlin for talks with Stalin, and Stalin frankly believed that this conference could not achieve "major achievements." The Soviet delegation not only failed to reach an agreement at the conference but also used it as a forum to promote prejudices and emotional impulses instead of seeking reason and understanding. The divide between the Allies is now clearly in sight. The United States is "agreeing for the sake of agreement," so it will not compromise on major principles.

[Associated Press Washington, 21st Dispatch] Secretary of State Marshall broadcasted to the nation today, reporting on the course of the 革期科 conference, lasting half an hour. It is said that although the four foreign ministers failed to reach an agreement on major issues, their achievements in promoting the final settlement in the future may be greater than those actually felt. Various major disagreements were fully exposed for the first time and are now clearly understood. Therefore, when negotiations are reopened in the future, there may be a correct understanding of the solution. The failure of the Moscow Conference to reach an agreement, in our view, is due to the Soviet Union's insistence on its various proposals. According to this proposal, Germany should establish a centralized government and obtain absolute control over the entire country, but because it is small in land and densely populated, and must use a large part of its production to compensate the Soviet Union, it will inevitably be economically unsustainable. The Soviet delegation also made the same request to Austria in another way. From the perspective of the American delegation, this attempt not only made the United States endlessly lose money, but also promoted the deterioration of German and European life, allowing dictatorship and struggle to take advantage of the situation. Moscow promotes emotionalism and erases reason and understanding. The accusations and interpretations of the Soviet representatives regarding the Potsdam and other agreements are very different from the facts known to the public or the actual knowledge of the American delegation. We cannot compromise on major principles and must sincerely understand where we disagree with each other. Marshall reported on the content of his meeting with Stalin, saying: Stalin once said that the Moscow Conference was merely a "reconnaissance unit's forward contact" for resolving the European peace treaty. Marshall also said that in the past, disputes over other issues would usually lead everyone to exhaustion, and then they would recognize the necessity of compromise. This conference has hardly any possibility of major achievements. Stalin believes that major issues, such as the disarmament of Germany, the German political organization, compensation, and economic unification, are all possible to compromise, so there is a need for patience and no need to be pessimistic. I sincerely hope that Stalin's views are correct, which implies that the Soviet delegation will show greater cooperation in future conferences. But we cannot ignore the time factor. The revival of Europe is far behind schedule. The forces of division are becoming increasingly apparent. When the doctors are making a clinical diagnosis, the patient's condition is getting worse. Therefore, I believe that certain actions cannot wait until after exhaustion to compromise. New problems are emerging, and any action to address these urgent problems must be taken immediately. Marshall concluded: "The current world situation and the position of the United States make the American people responsible for unified action." Marshall praised Republican Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Vandenberg and Democratic former Senate Foreign Relations Committee Wang Xixi Connally for jointly leading the passage of the Aid to Turkey Act, believing that Washington's goals were consistent, and that his negotiations in Moscow were very rewarding.

### After the Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference U.S. Policy Becomes More Determined It Can Gain the Support of Non-Communist Countries in Europe

[Associated Press Moscow, 28th Dispatch] Since the Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference, the United States' European policy has been clearly defined as unprecedented. The American delegation hopes that this policy can gain the support of all non-communist nations in Europe. The main points are as follows: (1) President Truman announced aid to Greece and Turkey. The Soviet side denounced it as American imperialism. Diplomats from the United States, Britain, France, and some small countries outside Moscow said that this move shows the seriousness of the United States' intentions toward communism and the willingness of the United States to act on its words. (2) The international right to utilize the resources of the Ruhr and Silesia areas is recognized by the United States as a basic need of the European economy. Secretary of State Marshall has repeatedly advocated that a European Economic Committee be entrusted with the task of unifying European economic work. (3) Marshall's statement on the Four-Power Treaty. Although the tone of the draft was intended to be conciliatory to avoid offending Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, Marshall was no different than saying that regardless of whether there is a Four-Power Treaty, the United States intends to control Germany for many years. (4) Definition of democracy. In discussing the German political issue, Marshall stated that the United States supports democracy and individual freedom. Most of his advisors believe that this is one of the central issues of the U.S.-Soviet conflict. (5) The United States has repeatedly tried to win France's support and has been quite successful. The United States wants to make France clearly join the Western bloc in the conflict with the Soviet Union. This desire can be seen in the U.S. attitude towards the Saar, German coal mines, and other issues. (6) The entire policy towards Germany has evolved from demilitarization to focusing on rebuilding a peaceful Germany without demanding reparations. The United States insists that Germany must be self-sufficient and manufacture goods for the needs of all of Europe. The above are the main points of the newly developed American policy. It remains to be seen whether it will be welcomed by Germany's small neighbors. The development of American policy involves many difficulties and disputes, and there are many fierce debates within the American delegation. The most famous are the conflict between Dulles and his "Pan-European" line and Clay and his "Germany first" line. Due to the weakness of Britain and France, which cannot maintain their leading positions in Europe, European power politics has been reduced to a matter of U.S.-Soviet relations. The U.S. relationship has changed from "good neighbor" to "strong neighbor." The U.S. attitude has reached such a degree that the American people need friendship and cooperation, but they feel that they cannot obtain it without confronting force with force. Therefore, even the wording of the Austrian peace treaty is disputed, because all parties do not trust that the other party has the sincerity to fulfill its obligations.

### Stetson's Remarks That the U.S. Should Remain Strong

[French News Agency New York, 28th Dispatch] American Republican presidential candidate Stetson recently returned here after inspecting sixteen European countries and gave a speech to the press, saying: If the United States can remain strong and adopt humanitarian policies that benefit all countries, then peace can be maintained for at least thirty years. However, the United States must avoid all government policies of exploiting important industries. If production can be increased, the standard of living can be raised. This can only be achieved by private enterprise, not by the government. As for his meeting with Marshal Stalin, Stetson refused to express any opinions, only saying that he had recorded the conversation during the talk and plans to publish it simultaneously in both English and Russian.

### Pravda Commentary

Said that the Foreign Ministers' Conference Achieved Much

[Our Newspaper Dispatch] London, 29th Broadcast: The Soviet "Pravda" wrote an article claiming that the Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference had achieved much and sternly refuted foreign newspapers' claims that the conference had failed. The editorial said that the conference reached many important agreements and clarified the true positions of the countries on the German issue, which was a success. The Moscow Conference can be said to have laid the foundation for resolving the German issue.

### Marshall's Broadcast Speech Most Members Praised It

[United Press Washington, 29th Dispatch] Democratic leader Barkley praised Marshall's report today as "the most candid and meaningful summary of the Moscow Conference that he has discovered." This can be seen as the basic tone of the initial response of Congress to his report. Barkley also said: "In my opinion, Marshall has defended the position of the United States with rare ability and composure." Other Democratic and Republican senators and representatives unanimously responded to Barkley's statement and agreed that Marshall made a meaningful and detailed report on the Moscow Four-Power Conference. However, Senator Pepper, who had recently criticized the U.S. administration's aid to Turkey plan, said: "Marshall's report has asked clearly that if we want to make progress in resolving the differences that exist between the U.S. and the Soviet Union, then we should both engage in resolving this issue in a spirit of compromise. We cannot solve it piecemeal."

### Clearing Lend-Lease Debts U.S. and Soviet Union to Negotiate Tomorrow

[Reuters Washington, 28th Dispatch] Soviet Ambassador to the U.S. Novikov has informed the State Department that he is prepared to begin negotiations with the United States to resolve lend-lease debts.

### U.S. House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eaton Directly Accuses Soviet Politics The Situation in Korea Is Exactly the Same as in Greece and Turkey

[United Press Washington, 28th Dispatch] House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eaton said today: If Greece and Turkey are overthrown, then Iran and other Arab countries cannot avoid the same situation, followed by Afghanistan, India, and China. In that case, 140 million American people will confront 2 billion people incited by "ideas aimed at eliminating us." Eaton frankly stated that the plan to aid Greece and Turkey is to prevent communism from spreading from its source - the Soviet Union - to all parts.

[Reuters Washington, 28th Dispatch] House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eaton said today in the House Judiciary Committee that the situation we are facing in Korea is exactly the same as in Greece and Turkey. The country is not only divided into two parts by the U.S. and the Soviet Union but also has communist philosophy penetrating the American zone. I sincerely do not know how to avoid serious conflict with the Soviet Union.

### Wallace Receives Reporters

Explaining Opinions on Domestic and Foreign Policies

[United Press Washington, 29th Dispatch] Wallace has left an open door for the organization of a "Party of Peace" in order to nominate him as a candidate in the 1948 presidential election. In his first formal press conference since returning from Europe, Wallace defended his right to express his views in opposition to Truman's foreign policy while the United States was not at war abroad. He said that the way to maintain world peace is to lend foreign countries plows and tractors rather than munitions. In the hour-long press conference, Wallace touched on a wide range of domestic and foreign issues, and his opinions were roughly as follows: (1) The United States will have a commercial recession in 1948, "but not a serious one." The United States will not encounter a serious economic recession until its funds really begin to pile up like mountains and foreign countries run out of their dollars. (2) The Soviet Union fears that the United States will have a major economic setback, which may be the reason why the Soviet Union refused to participate in the World Bank and other international economic activities. (3) It is easier for the United States to allocate large sums of money to purchase munitions for export abroad than to cultivate farmland and other projects at home. Wallace said that he does not intend to travel abroad again, but he has been invited to the Netherlands, Belgium, Greece, Chile, and Argentina. He also said that no one had invited him to visit the Soviet Union.

The Belgian representative, Mr. Longerstaey, served as temporary chairman. Delegations from all 55 member states attended, though each only sent one or two representatives. First, Mr. Longerstaey delivered the opening remarks, expressing the hope that the meeting would produce results and lead to a solution to the serious Palestine problem. He stated that the Palestine problem is one of the most difficult problems today, and he was pleased that the United Kingdom had called for international cooperation to resolve it.

The Chinese representative, Mr. Guo Taiqi, delivered a welcoming speech, expressing his great pleasure at Siam's accession to the United Nations. He stated that the economic and cultural relations between China and Siam would be further strengthened through cooperation within the United Nations. Prince Wiwatchai Chaiyan immediately delivered a reply, stating that Siam would contribute to world peace with its spirit of international cooperation.

The General Assembly then proceeded to elect the vice-chairmen, with representatives from the five major powers – China, the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union – as well as Ecuador and India being elected. The General Assembly was then adjourned, with a decision to continue the meeting at 7:00 PM (Greenwich Mean Time).

Political interests will prevent the fundamental issues from being resolved."

### Siam to Request Land Concession from Vietnam Along the Border

[French News Agency, Washington, 28th] The French-Siamese Dispute Mediation Committee is about to meet. It is reported that Siam plans to request the concession of some land along the Vietnamese border. The committee was established in accordance with the Franco-Siamese Agreement of November 1948 and includes representatives from France, Siam, and neutral countries, specifically to discuss the existing territorial issues between Siam and Vietnam. Siam has already returned some land in Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia that it occupied during the war with the help of Japan. Therefore, the French delegation will no longer make any demands. The Siamese delegation, however, requests to obtain some land near the mouth of the Mekong River on the border of Laos. The committee will also discuss the issue of damage to French public and private property by Siam and its compensation. A report should be submitted within six months of the meeting.

### White Rice Retains Vitamins Through New Method
American Scientists Invent New Method

[French News Agency, New York, 28th] According to reliable sources in the local business community, several American scientists have invented a method to increase the amount of vitamins in rice, even after it has been milled white, while still maintaining its original texture.

### Conservative Forces Strong in Japanese Parliament; Socialist Party Striving for Compromise; Movements of Neutral Factions Attract Great Attention

[Asia East Agency, Tokyo, 29th] The executive committee of the Japanese Socialist Party in Tokyo convened a meeting on the 28th to discuss the fundamental policy and attitude towards the political situation. After further discussion at the central standing committee meeting on May 3rd and the central executive committee meeting on May 10th, it will be announced all at once. It is reported that leading figures of the party, such as Katayama and Nishio, as well as most members of the party, support the following opinions: (1) The attitude of opposition to the Liberal Party adopted by party members before the election should be abandoned, and the responsibility for the next cabinet should be assumed; (2) The next cabinet should exclude the Communist Party and form a coalition cabinet of the Socialist, Liberal, Democratic, and National Cooperative parties; (3) Katayama should be the prime minister; (4) Regarding policy and cabinet member issues, the Socialist Party should make the maximum possible concessions and not adopt an attitude that would lead to the failure to form a cabinet or return to being an opposition party; Persuade left-wing members of the party to cooperate in helping Katayama form a cabinet.

[Asia East Agency, Tokyo, 29th] Liberal Party Secretary-General Ohno met with Prime Minister Yoshida on the 28th. It is reported that Ohno's attitude was very firm. He believes that the Liberal Party is not much different from the Socialist Party in this general election. If it cooperates with the Democratic Party, conservative forces can still hold more than half of the seats in the parliament, so it should not easily entrust the government to the Socialist Party. Ohno also believes that about ten of the elected candidates who are independent or belong to small parties will join the Liberal Party soon, so it can still surpass the Socialist Party and become the largest party. If Ohno is right, the movements of the elected candidates who are independent or belong to small parties are worthy of attention.

### Fourth General Election to be Held Today

[United Press, Tokyo, 29th] Japan is holding four elections in April. Tomorrow is the last of these elections. Voters will vote to elect approximately 156,000 local councilors, including the councilors of the 46 counties, the 204 prefectures, and the villages and towns. Observers predict that the lower-level administrative structure will be completely changed because "undesirable elements" have been purged and are no longer allowed to hold public office.

### Japanese War Criminals Fantasize, Claim China Initiated the War

Defendant Hatano Unwilling to Speak

[Associated Press, Tokyo, 29th] At their defense today, defendants Hideki Tojo and 24 others at the International Tribunal claimed that the threat of the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people's acts of aggression against Japanese residents in China prompted the Japanese army to station troops in China, leading to the "China Incident." The court immediately prohibited the defense. Presiding Judge Webb stated, "If the Chinese Communists or other Chinese people did indeed attack Japanese residents, it was because they anticipated the actions of the Japanese army."

[French News Agency, Tokyo, 29th] The Far East International Military Tribunal opened today. A witness for the defense, Hatano, was called to testify about the activities of the Chinese Communist Party, but the witness refused to speak. He was sent home without success. The defendants all claim that Hatano is an important witness in the "China Incident," but he has repeatedly declined to testify. This morning, he was subpoenaed and brought to court by American military police, but he still pretended to be mute.

### Large U.S. Air Force Unit to Fly to Japan for Exercises

[Associated Press, Tokyo, 29th] A large unit of U.S. B-29 and C-54 aircraft will fly to Japan this week and remain for 30 days to conduct simulated war exercises.

### British Foreign Secretary Returns to London; Emphasizes Patience in Building Peace

[Our Newspaper] London, 29th (Broadcast): Bevin returned here by plane today and made a statement, saying: Regarding the pursuit of peace, the British people must be patient. We are not working for the present; we are working for the next hundred generations. Looking ahead, I am neither blindly optimistic nor pessimistic. The world has suffered from the ravages of war for six years, and the work of reconstruction will not be easy. Whether the Foreign Ministers' conference to be held in London in November will be more successful than the Moscow conference, I dare not predict at this time. When I left England, I thought that a peace treaty with Austria could be concluded, making Austria an independent country, but in fact, no agreement was reached. However, a committee has been established, and the date of the treaty is not far off.

[French News Agency, Berlin, 28th] British Foreign Secretary Bevin arrived here by train from Moscow at 3:15 PM today. After getting off the train, he went directly to the city with Marshal Douglas, the Commander-in-Chief of the British Army in Germany, to hold talks with Sir Paganham, the new British Minister to Germany, and other senior British officials. Foreign Secretary Bevin will stay at Marshal Douglas's residence and is scheduled to fly back to London tomorrow.

Bidault Returns Home

[French News Agency, Paris, 29th] French Foreign Minister Bidault led the French delegation back to the country from Moscow by special train and arrived this morning. Upon getting off the train, Mr. Bidault said: "We have done our best, and the work has been smooth. The hope and desire to achieve certain things still exist, but we must act quickly. France's interests have been respected. We have also brought back some coal." (Referring to the Anglo-French coal agreement).

### Report on the Moscow Conference; Full Text of Marshall's Speech

[U.S. Information Service, Washington, 28th] Secretary of State Marshall delivered a radio address to the nation tonight, outlining the various issues and results of the recently concluded Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference. The full text of the speech is as follows:

Tonight, I hope to make the basic nature of the various issues discussed at the Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference completely clear to everyone.

This conference is discussing the heart of the peace that we are striving for. This conference is discussing the important centers of Europe—Germany and Austria. This is a region with many technically trained people, with great resources and factories. This is a region that has twice nearly brought the world to destruction. In the negotiations in Moscow, all the obvious disagreements regarding the Italian and Balkan treaties were raised, but in fact, they have not yet been resolved.

General discussions and ambiguous plans cannot deal with the difficulties that have a direct relationship with our future civilization. In order to deal with such difficulties, we must specifically solve various extremely complex issues, such as issues related to borders, production, and the control of the necessities of life for millions of people. Newspaper and radio reports have familiarized you with the daily activities of the Foreign Ministers' Conference. I need not say more, lest I repeat myself. However, due to the extremely complex nature of the three major issues we considered, I find it necessary to give a detailed report to describe my views on the various issues from my seat. Our hopes for a peace treaty with Austria and a German defense agreement in Moscow may be realized. As for the peace treaty with Germany and related issues (mostly current German issues), we had hoped to reach an agreement in principle so that our representatives would have something to follow in their work before the next meeting is held. In this broadcast, it is impossible to actually discuss the various issues that remain unresolved at the Foreign Ministers' Conference. I would like to draw people's attention to some basic issues, which, once resolved, may lead to the elimination of other disagreements.

The European Coal Supply Has a Far-Reaching Impact

Coal issue—the conference must not only consider the immediate impact of certain issues on the people of Europe in a few months, but also the complexity of the issues. To give an example, all of Europe needs more coal to supply factories, public utilities, railways, and households. However, many of the Allied coal mines cannot be mined unless those damaged coal mines, coal mining machinery, railway transport, and other equipment and tools are fully restored. These restoration works require more steel, and more steel in turn requires more coal to manufacture it. Therefore, we must remember one point: while the necessary restoration work is underway, the amount of coal that Allied neighboring countries may obtain in the near future will inevitably decrease.

The reduction in the amount of coal will gradually increase the number of unemployed in terms of labor and prolong the revitalization of production in terms of materials. These materials could have been exported for profit to purchase food and necessities. Therefore, the sluggishness of production has become an inevitable consequence of coal mine restoration work. This phenomenon has deeply affected France. Therefore, solving the coal issue has become a serious difficulty for France. However, in Germany, in addition to American loans, it must use coal for production and then export the products in exchange for the import of necessary food. Therefore, other countries, such as Britain and the Soviet Union, are also directly affected, but to varying degrees.

Negotiations on the German Issue Involve World Peace

Moreover, the coal issue, which is directly related to steel production, is underpinned by the important issue of the German heavy industrial base, which may become a threat to world peace again in the future. I cite this example to illustrate the various complex situations involved in these negotiations.

Germany—The Allied Control Council in Berlin submitted detailed reports on the political, military, economic, and financial situation under the current German military government. Regarding these issues, the foreign ministers considered the form and scope of the German provisional political institutions and the procedures to be followed in preparing the peace treaty with Germany.

Negotiations on the German issue not only involve the security of Europe and the world, but also the prosperity of the entire Europe. Our mission was to discuss the conditions of a long-term treaty, but at the same time, we are faced with various direct issues of great importance to the poor people of Europe, who are crying out for help, for coal, food, and most of the necessities of life. Most of them hate Germany, which caused this disaster. These issues are also of great importance to the people of Britain and the United States, who cannot continue to foot the bill for Germany, taking out hundreds of millions of dollars, because no measures have been taken to quickly end this appropriation.

The serious and fundamental German issues that concern me are: (1) the authority of the German central government; (2) the economic nature of Germany and its relationship with European countries; (3) the scope and nature of compensation; (4) the borders of Germany; (5) the issue of how all countries that fought against Germany should participate in drafting and signing the peace treaty with Germany.

### Fubo Warship Tragedy Trial Begins; Relatives of the Deceased Surround Dai Ruling; Crying and Cursing, Demanding Compensation; Defendant Claims to Have Searched for Surviving Officers and Soldiers After the Collision; Order to Wait for Inspection of the Haimin Ship Before Further Trial

[Our Newspaper] Regarding the sinking tragedy of the Fubo gunboat, the District Prosecutor's Office investigated and determined that the Haimin ship failed to make efforts to rescue the officers and soldiers of the Fubo warship after the collision, resulting in the death of 130 sailors at the bottom of the sea. The captain of the Haimin ship, Dai Ruling, was prosecuted on suspicion of murder. The case was initially heard in the Criminal Court of the District Court by Judge Zhong Xianda yesterday morning at 9:30. In addition to questioning the defendant Dai Ruling, Jiao Dexiao (the only survivor of the Fubo warship), Wu Nianzu, Wu Kan (chief and second officers of the Haimin ship), Lang Fuxiang, Liu Fenfa, Ma Fugen, Zheng Jiaren, Zheng Guorong, Li Xiuming, Sun Junhua, Luo Qian, and others were summoned to testify. The court adjourned at noon, and Judge Zhong ordered that the two parties be convened to inspect the Haimin ship at 9:00 AM on May 6, and then schedule another trial. It was also decided that the District Court would jointly inspect the ship with the defendant's lawyer, Wei Wenda, Jiao Dexiao, and two representatives from the Naval Department.

Yesterday, 45 relatives of the officers and soldiers who died in the Fubo warship gathered at the District Court early in the morning to wait for the court to open. After Judge Zhong of Criminal Court II took his seat, the relatives of the officers and soldiers lined up and sat quietly in the front row of the audience. Dozens of students from the local law school also came to attend the hearing, and the courtroom was extremely crowded for a time.

Dai Ruling's Testimony: The Course of the Incident

Defendant Dai Ruling was first brought to the court. He testified that he was 42 years old, from Fujian Province, and was the captain of the Haimin ship. He had only been in the position for three months and had previously served as the captain of other ocean liners. The maximum sailing speed of the Haimin ship was 13 knots per hour, and the speed at the time of the collision at midnight on March 19 was 9.5 knots. At 0:00, the sea was completely dark, and the wind and waves were very high. A white light was discovered on the left side of the ship. At 0:07, a green light was seen, indicating that a ship was approaching. The Haimin ship immediately sounded the whistle once and immediately reversed the engine. However, it was too late to avoid the collision, but there was no major shock. At that time, it was not known that a ship had sunk. At this point, the court turned to question the second officer of the Haimin ship, Wu Kan, who testified that he was on the night shift that day. After discovering the white light in front at 0:00, the captain went to the deck to investigate. At the time of the collision, he roughly saw the Fubo warship sailing to the right corner. After the collision, Captain Dai immediately ordered the ship to stop, ordered me to send light signals, and used wireless radio to respond to the Fubo warship, but there was no response. After stopping the ship for about ten minutes and still receiving no response, they slowly sailed to search. About an hour later, they heard cries for help. They used a searchlight to search the sea and discovered Jiao Dexiao. They immediately steered the ship closer. Due to the strong wind and waves at the time, it took nearly two hours to rescue Jiao. Then the chief officer of the Haimin ship, Wu Nianzu, was questioned. He testified that he was asleep at the time of the collision. He was awakened and went to the deck to observe. He met the captain, who ordered him to check the damage to the ship. He saw nothing else. The testimonies of the helmsman and other crew members of the Haimin ship were roughly the same as those of the previous two.

Jiao Dexiao Claims: The Ship Sank Very Quickly

However, according to Jiao Dexiao, the only survivor of the Fubo warship, who was the chief engineer on the ship and is now 31 years old, he was asleep at the time of the collision. He was awakened by a loud noise, and the ship's body shook violently. Knowing that something had happened, he put on his clothes and went to the deck. He saw more than 70 people gathered on the deck, and the captain was directing the sending of emergency distress calls and using lights to send signals to the Haimin ship. They were also preparing lifeboats, life vests, buoys, and other escape equipment. Unexpectedly, the ship sank very quickly, sinking in about two or three minutes. I also went into the water with the ship. Because I had a life vest, I floated to the surface and grabbed a buoy. At that time, there were many officers and soldiers floating on the surface of the sea, and I heard cries for help. However, I saw the Haimin ship continuing to sail forward. After struggling with the wind and waves for nearly an hour, I saw a ship approaching, so I tried to get closer. By the time I was rescued on the ship, I was unconscious and unaware of anything.

A Sound of Sobbing in the Audience

When Jiao Dexiao testified, a sound of sobbing came from the relatives of the deceased officers and soldiers in the audience. The bailiffs immediately stepped forward to stop them. Judge Zhong then questioned Zheng Guorong, a passenger on the Haimin ship, who testified that he was asleep at the time of the incident, but he felt the ship was still moving, but he could not distinguish the direction. After ten minutes, he still did not see any movement. At that time, the passengers were all talking about it, because they were in the lower cabin and did not see what Dai Ruling was doing. At about 2:00 AM, they discovered Jiao Dexiao in the sea, and the sailors on the ship rescued him and pulled him up. Dai Ruling was questioned again. He testified that after the collision, according to the rules of navigation, he should first check whether the ship was in danger of sinking, so he stopped sailing for about ten minutes. At the same time, he ordered the second officer to use lights and wireless radio to try to contact the Fubo warship, but there was no response. Because the ship was reversing before the collision, and the Fubo warship had not stopped sailing, the distance between the ship and the Fubo warship was actually very far after the ship stopped. After the ship was inspected, it slowly sailed along the Fubo warship's route to search, so it was able to discover Jiao Dexiao.

Dark Night, High Waves, Difficult Rescue

The court inquired why it took so long to rescue Jiao Dexiao and whether he had any malicious intentions and was trying to silence him. Dai replied that rescuing people in the dark sea is not the same as on land. Moreover, when the ship is sailing, the wind and waves are even greater. Even if they are not drowned, they may be killed by the waves. Therefore, they must be especially careful. This can be explained by maritime experts. The court also questioned Ma Fugen, the sailor on the Haimin ship who rescued Jiao Dexiao, who testified that because he only saw Jiao alone in the sea, he did not launch a lifeboat and threw a lifebuoy five times. At that time, the wind and waves were treacherous, and rescue was difficult. The fifth time the lifebuoy was thrown, it was successful. The testimonies of the other witnesses did not have any new discoveries. After the court adjourned, when Dai was being escorted back to prison, the relatives of the deceased officers and soldiers, young and old, men and women, all rushed forward to surround Dai, crying and cursing in a chaotic scene, demanding compensation. After the bailiffs worked hard to disperse them, Dai was able to escape and enter the prison.

Now, in order to sentence him to the punishment he deserves as soon as possible, the military tribunal has decided to hold the trial at the Hangzhou Higher Court on the 26th of next month so that it can accept the reports from the local people and collect on-site evidence. In the next few days, the military tribunal will send people to post notices in eastern Zhejiang, hoping that the women who have suffered humiliation will come forward to report as much as possible.

### Establishing Rescue Agencies on Both Railways

[Our Newspaper] The Two Railways Bureau originally planned to add a rescue agency in its proposed new construction plan. The bureau has decided to establish this rescue agency as soon as possible because there have been derailments recently.

### Why Steal When You Own Property? Late-Night Theft Revealed While Hiring a Car: A Series of Crimes Committed by One Person

[Report from Our Newspaper] The famous thief Quan Shiwen, also known as Little Shanghai and Langtou, is 25 years old, from Shanghai, skilled in martial arts, as light as a swallow, and able to scale walls and jump over obstacles at a height of two or three zhang. He owns a Western-style house at No. 5 Quanjiazhai on Ouyang Road in Pudong. At midnight on the 21st, he stole twelve large electric fans and six oscillating fans from No. 15, Lane 237, Duolun Road. Afterwards, he hired a Chariot Car from the Sichuan North Road and Dixiwei Road intersection to transport the electric fans to Wu Changgao's house in Caopeng, North Station. At that time, because he did not have the money to pay the fare, he gave one of the electric fans to the driver as payment. When the driver drove back to the car company and took out the electric fan, it happened to be seen by the police officers of the Sichuan Road Police Station's patrol team. Because it was midnight, they asked the driver sternly where the electric fan came from in the car, and he confessed the truth.

After the police officers reported to Deputy Bureau Chief Zeng, he immediately ordered Wu Zhenlong, the head of the criminal section, to supervise inspectors Liu Zhaonian, police chief Ren Hou, Gu Wenyue, and police officers Shen Changqi and Li Zhiming to go to the aforementioned location in the Caopeng and arrest Wu Changgao for interrogation. According to his confession, the electric fans belonged to Quan Shiwen and he did not know where they were stolen from. At first, he wanted to store them at Yu's house, but he refused. Quan then tried to move them elsewhere. He also made an appointment to come to Yu's residence again at noon the next day. After the Wu Section Chief took the confession, he sent officers to wait there. When Quan arrived as scheduled, he was arrested and brought to the bureau for questioning. He directly admitted to committing numerous crimes: (1) No. 15, Lane 237, Duolun Road. (2) Wang Genlin's house at No. 3, Xiang'an Lane, Bao'an Road. (3) No. 99, Lane 202, Duolun Road. (4) No. 4, Lane 1377, Dixiwei Road. (5) Xu Yun's house at No. 6, Lane 705, the same road. (6) Zhang Aiping's house at No. 6, Lane 137, the same road. In the above six houses, he stole bicycles, radios, electric fans, etc., worth more than 200 million yuan. They were all sold and squandered. However, he denied having accomplices and insisted that all the crimes were committed by him alone. The stolen goods that have been retrieved by the branch bureau include six bicycles, four men's and women's overcoats, three five-tube radios, three raincoats, one air gun, and a batch of woolen cloth worth about 50 million yuan. The owners have claimed the goods. The interrogation has now been completed, and it is planned to transfer the case to the judicial authorities for trial soon.

### Pan Da Disagrees with Death Sentence: High Court Schedules Retrial

[Report from Our Newspaper] Pan Da, a local tyrant in western Shanghai, is the fourth person to be sentenced to death by the High Court.

It is now learned that the High Court has scheduled the retrial for the morning of May 6th. The first hearing will be an interrogation. Whether Pan can escape the clutches of death depends on this trial.

### Unfilial Son: Attempting to Rape Stepmother: Owner of a Tea Garden Detained

[Report from Our Newspaper] Du Qunfa, 25 years old, the owner of the Fuxing Tea Garden at No. 1640 Changning Road, Zhoujiaqiao, western Shanghai, was spoiled and raised and was extravagant. Du's father died early, leaving behind a wife and a concubine. The wife, Xu, is 54 years old, and the concubine, Zhang, is only 27 years old. Du Qunfa is the legitimate son and often harbored improper thoughts about his stepmother. On the 20th of this month, he tried to rape his stepmother. His legitimate mother stepped forward to stop him, but he pulled out a knife and tried to chop her. Fortunately, neighbors caught him. The two women of the Du family, with such an unfilial son, filed a lawsuit with the local prosecutor's office, requesting legal sanctions. Prosecutor Li Mingshan signed an arrest warrant for the defendant and ordered him to be detained after interrogation.

### The Androgynous Person Has Great Supernatural Powers: Sensational in Peiping Ten Years Ago: Imprisoned and Almost Killed

[Report from Our Newspaper] The "androgynous person" Shen Junru, reported by our newspaper yesterday, has been transferred to the local prosecutor's office by the police station and has been detained for investigation. However, according to investigations by reporters from various sources, the perpetrator is the one who caused a sensation in Peiping ten years ago, luring the concubine of a certain important person and being arrested by the then Mayor of Peiping, Zhang Xueliang. It was originally planned to be punished by law, but in the end, because the "demon" had great magic power, it was finally dealt with by deportation. When the perpetrator was in custody, they still liked to wear men's clothing. After being severely reprimanded by the guards, they began to correct their attire, but their every move had lost the nature of a woman. As for the crimes committed in Peiping, they were roughly the same as those committed in this city. Therefore, there were many wives of dignitaries in Peiping who had contact with this "demon." At that time, they were known as "Fifth Master." After the demon was deported, they once lived in seclusion in Hangzhou. Unexpectedly, shortly after the victory, they sneaked into Shanghai, revived their business, and used their special skills to seduce respectable women. In the end, they were arrested again. In addition to the three victims who were arrested at the same time, it is heard that they are also involved with the concubine of a certain celebrity and the former concubine of a certain vice minister. It is said that the perpetrator once married a man surnamed He as a concubine in Peiping and even had a son. Later, due to emotional breakdown, they separated. Since then, they have engaged in licentious and shameless activities.

### Cracking Down on Unlicensed Buildings: Expanding the Construction Ban Area for Shantytowns

[Report from Our Newspaper] The meeting to crack down on illegal buildings in this city was held yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM in the conference room of the Municipal Public Works Bureau, chaired by Zhao Zukang, Director of the Public Works Bureau. The matters decided upon for discussion are as follows: (1) It was decided to restore the patrol car team in early May, cooperating with the police bureau and the public works bureau, to patrol various districts, advise new shantytowns to demolish, and individually crack down on existing shantytowns. (2) Unlicensed buildings in this city will be investigated and cracked down on. (3) When the nature of the use of a house changes (such as from a residence to a school or institution), the Public Works Bureau must be notified, and a permit must be reapplied for. Attention should be paid to public safety facilities. (4) Expand the construction ban area for shantytowns in this city. In addition to the original designated old British and French concessions, Hongkou, and areas within ten meters of major routes where shantytowns are not allowed to be built, it will be extended to Qujiang Road, from the urban area of Nanshi to the east to the Huangpu River.

### Wage-Price Disconnect Too Far: Labor Problem Experts Advocate: Index Should Be Restored

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Social Affairs Bureau will convene a meeting within days to study the issue of unfreezing the cost of living index. However, because unfreezing the index may hinder government orders, the association may seek other ways to find appropriate solutions to improve the lives of workers under the high pressure of prices and recommend that the central government adopt them. A reporter visited a labor problem expert yesterday to inquire about their opinion on this issue. They expressed absolute support for unfreezing. When the government initially ordered the freeze, it stated that it would do its best to suppress prices. However, as evidenced by the facts in recent months, today's prices are far too disconnected from the index in January. If we want to continue freezing it for a long time and disregard the lives of employees, it is really too unfair. If it is said that it is to maintain the government's prestige, then at least other methods should be used to remedy the situation as soon as possible. The reason why workers are causing resentment now is because of the sudden and wild jump in prices, causing psychological imbalance. If prices had risen gradually, workers would probably not have been so dissatisfied. In the past, various parties have discussed whether prices stimulate wages or wages stimulate prices. The fact that prices continued to rise wildly after the freezing of the workers' cost of living index can prove that wages did not stimulate prices. However, now, if the workers' cost of living index is unfrozen and suddenly restored from more than 7,900 times in January to the appropriate multiples in April, whether this will stimulate price increases should also be carefully considered beforehand. In short, regardless of whether to unfreeze the index or find other ways without unfreezing it, attention should be paid to the living problems of employees as soon as possible. Otherwise, if workers' lives cannot be maintained, disputes will inevitably continue to emerge.

### Evaluation Committee Studies Remedial Measures: Plans to Increase the Number of Daily Necessities Calculated

[Another Dispatch] Last time, Wu Kaixian, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, went to Nanjing and requested instructions on the issue of unfreezing the index from Zhang, the President of the Executive Yuan, and Gu, the Minister of the Ministry of Social Affairs. He has now instructed the various expert members of the Shanghai Labor-Capital Evaluation Committee to form a subcommittee to study it. The subcommittee is scheduled to meet on May 3rd and will formulate measures based on the results of the study and submit them to the highest authorities for adoption and implementation, seeking remedial measures in the event of soaring prices without violating the principles of the government's economic plan. It is heard that the expert members advocate that, in addition to the original six types of rice, coal, oil, sugar, salt, and cloth for differential allowances, various other daily necessities in the cost of living index should be increased, so that professional workers and industrial workers can maintain their current minimum living standards.

### Busting a Car Theft Gang: Led by a Korean, Committing Ten Crimes Over Several Months: Detectives Disguised as Car Buyers: Arresting People and Recovering Stolen Goods Near Nanyang Bridge

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Fourth Inspection Brigade of the Garrison Headquarters recently received a tip-off that there is an international car theft gang organization in this city, led by a young Korean man named Li Yiping. He has more than ten accomplices who are skilled at stealing and robbing. They wear Western suits, enter and exit social venues, and specialize in stealing jeeps and various vehicles when people are unprepared. After multiple investigations, a lead was obtained on the 25th of this month. However, the organization is quite strict and difficult to deal with. After discussions, it was decided to raise 7 million yuan first and send officers in disguise to the Dashanyuan teahouse, which is contacted by the gang, under the pretext of buying jeeps on behalf of customers. Negotiations were held repeatedly with a man named Jin Yunze. Finally, a price of 30 million yuan per vehicle was agreed upon. To show good faith, a deposit of 7 million yuan was paid first, and it was agreed to exchange goods and money at the intersection of Nanyang Bridge and Xizang South Road that evening on the 27th. On the due date, the Inspection Brigade dispatched a large number of personnel to lie in ambush in the Nanyang Bridge area in advance. At about 10:00 PM, a military jeep with the license plate number 18523 of the First United States Military Forces in Shanghai, driven by a Russian, arrived. In addition to the Russian, there were also the contact person, the Korean Jin Yunze, Cui Zhongtai, and another Russian, who were all arrested. After being interrogated, the two Russians confessed that one was named Gu Lie Liti (residing at No. 58, Lane 222, Gongping Road) and the other was named Nalis. The vehicle they were driving had just been stolen from the US military parking lot at the Shichuan Building on Pushi Road. However, they stubbornly refused to reveal the location of the leader and accomplices, only saying that they had been doing this for several months and had stolen about ten vehicles, all of which were sold immediately. One of the vehicles was sold to the Sanxing Car Company on Pingliang Road two months ago, and the proceeds had already been squandered. After the team received the confession, they immediately rushed to the Sanxing Car Company and arrested the manager, Qian Rongsheng. After interrogation, he admitted to receiving stolen goods. In addition to transferring the above-mentioned criminals to the Inspection Department of the Garrison Headquarters for verification, the team is still sending personnel to continue the investigation to ensure that all accomplices are brought to justice.

### Bill Dispute: Hu Hao Accused

[Report from Our Newspaper] Hu Hao, son of the overseas Chinese tycoon Hu Wenhu, and currently the director of the Sing Tao Football Team, was sued in the district court by a merchant named Min Zhenhan after news of the Sing Tao team's expedition to Shanghai was published in the newspapers. According to the complaint, in September of the 34th year of the Republic (1945), when Hu Hao was in Chongqing from Hong Kong, he purchased five boxes of menthol from Min Zhenhan, paying with three checks from the Chongqing branch of the Shanghai Commercial & Savings Bank and two checks from the Zhenye Bank, totaling 9.87 million yuan. The day after the transaction, Hu Hao took a plane and left the country. Three days later, when Min Zhenhan went to the bank to cash the checks, he was surprised to find that they had all been dishonored. He urgently went to the Yixin Garden Hotel to look for Hu Hao, only to find out that he had already left the country. He contacted Hu Wenhu via telegram for negotiations, but without result. Unable to do anything else, he filed a lawsuit in the Chongqing District Court. After a trial in absentia, Hu Hao was fined 90,000 yuan and ordered to pay back the amount of the checks plus interest. However, Hu Hao never returned and his whereabouts were unknown, making enforcement impossible. Now, upon learning that the Sing Tao Football Team was coming to Shanghai, it was assumed that Hu Hao would accompany the team, so a request was made to the district court for immediate detention and an order to repay the previous debt. After receiving the complaint, the district court summoned Hu Hao through the Sing Tao team, but Hu himself did not accompany the team to Shanghai this time, and the district court still has no way to enforce the judgment.

### Social Service: Shen Bao Newspaper and Relief Hospital Jointly Organize Prevention and Treatment of Trachoma - An Overview

Six Thousand Consultations Conducted Over Eight Months, More Than Four Hundred People Cured

Trachoma is a disease that is very widespread in our country, affecting an estimated 70% or more of the entire population, especially young men and women. Early-stage trachoma is often not easily detected, and therefore often ignored. By the time the root of the disease is deep, treatment is often difficult to achieve satisfactory results. This leads to further transmission, like a spark igniting a prairie fire. At best it affects personal health and career, but at worst it harms the nation and the people. With this in mind, our newspaper, in conjunction with the Relief Hospital on South Tibet Road in this city, launched a "Trachoma Prevention and Treatment Campaign" starting on August 1st of last year. Now, nine months later, although we do not presume to eradicate this disease completely, we hope to draw the attention of the people, and hope that young people will be vigilant about this disease! Since this prevention and treatment campaign began on August 1st of last year, it has undergone five phases. As of March 31st, the number of people applying for examination and treatment totaled 594, most of whom were middle school students, followed by university and elementary school students, and then teachers and staff. On average, each person received ten treatments, totaling more than six thousand treatments. According to the hospital's comprehensive statistics, most of those who applied for examination and treatment had stage two trachoma, totaling 241 people. Stage one patients were the second most numerous, with 142 people. The other stages three and four were only a dozen or so people.

As for the medical work, it was all the responsibility of the hospital's doctors. Medicines such as silver nitrate, silver sulfate, and yellow mercury ointment were all provided free of charge by the hospital. Among them, nine people underwent surgical treatment, which was performed voluntarily by Dr. Sun Yuanming of the hospital's ophthalmology department, without charging a single penny. According to the hospital's statistics, about 70% of those treated have recovered, which is still far from the planned goals. In the future, we will increase our efforts to achieve greater results and express our sincere gratitude to the enthusiastic people from all walks of life for their support.

### Tsinghua's 36th Anniversary Celebration: Alumni in Shanghai Celebrated Yesterday

[Report from Our Newspaper] Yesterday was the 36th anniversary of Tsinghua University. The Tsinghua Alumni Association in this city held a grand celebration at the 4th floor of the Bank of China, attended by more than 600 alumni. The scene was extremely lively. Around 6 o'clock, the dinner began. Many alumni had been separated for more than ten years. Once they reunited in one hall, they could not help but feel emotional, both sad and happy. Tang Xinghai and Lu Meiseng, classmates from the class of 1920, were in high spirits and took the lead in cheering. Thereupon, cheers arose one after another, like thunder. The class of 1909 was the earliest class, and all three classmates in Shanghai attended. Amid the enthusiastic applause of the audience, they also linked arms and cheered three times. Because yesterday was the first anniversary of Tsinghua's return to Beiping, the significance was different from the past, and the alumni's joy was even greater than in previous years. The association originally invited Mayor Wu and former President Weng Yongni to give speeches last night, but both Mr. Wu and Mr. Weng were unable to attend due to official business in Beijing. Therefore, Wang Zuliang, the president of the association this year, delivered a speech, sincerely encouraging the alumni to maintain the spirit of Tsinghua and to manage affairs with the spirit of seeking truth from facts, only knowing how to fulfill their duties and not knowing how to perfunctorily cope. Because of this, the struggles of the alumni in society have always been like the lone battle of classmate Sun Liren in those years. Although the fighting spirit has not been lost, the sacrifices are often extremely heavy. Therefore, in the future, we must strengthen unity and close cooperation to exert a greater force. We do not want to seek personal gain, we only seek to work together to be loyal to the country. We firmly believe that the unity of Tsinghua alumni, the exertion of strength, will surely make the country's future more brilliant. Wang then suggested that Shanghai alumni raise 100,000,000 yuan to build an "Alumni Hall" in the alma mater. Alumni Tang Xinghai, Xi Lun, and others immediately responded and were willing to assist in the grand event. Next, the Chinese Orchestra, led by Professor Wei Zhongle, performed Chinese music. This once-a-year celebration was announced to have ended in the sound of lively music.

### Xingdao Easily Defeats Jewish Team, Result 8-1, Victory Described Lightly

Hong Kong's Xingdao expeditionary force played its second match in Shanghai yesterday afternoon at 5 PM against the Jewish team at the Yi Guo Stadium. Over ten thousand spectators attended, and the police and constabulary worked hard to maintain excellent order. The match resulted in an easy 8-1 victory for Xingdao over the Jewish team.

The referee was Liang Guansong, the linesmen were 　Feng　 and Carlo Li District. Xingdao presented 　　, and the match began immediately. The Jewish team initially adopted an offensive strategy, but it was blocked by Xu Jingcheng. Liu Songsheng obtained the ball and passed it far forward. He Yingfen attempted a shot in front of the Jewish goal, but McNitty lightly caught it. Zhu Yongqiang attacked again, but was offside. At six minutes, "Little Three Son" Cao Qiuting had his first corner kick, which was also caught by McNitty. The Jewish players seized the opportunity to attack twice. Fu En received assistance from Demanya and made a close-range attack, but unfortunately, it went out of bounds. Shortly after, Koppstein also attempted a shot, but to no avail. Fu En and Kebitsky encircled the Xingdao goal, but fortunately, Hou Rongsheng saved the day, defusing the danger. This was the peak of the Jewish attack within the first quarter of an hour after the start of the match.

At sixteen minutes, Xingdao launched an all-out attack. Zhu Yongqiang broke through an opening and shot powerfully, but McNitty risked everything and tackled Zhu Yongqiang at his feet, like Zhao Yun saving A Dou. At seventeen minutes, Xue Pansiting committed a foul in the penalty area, causing a major penalty. Zhang Jinhai took the penalty kick, but McNitty dived sideways to save it. The two sides fought fiercely until the twenty-first minute. Koppstein committed a foul by colliding with a player 25 yards from the goal. Zhu Yongqiang took the free kick, and Zou Wenzhi headed the ball across. McNitty missed the catch, and He Yingfen seized the opportunity to catch up and push the ball into the net, making it 1-0. The away team opened the scoring, and their morale was high, creating dangerous situations in front of the Jewish goal. At twenty-five minutes, Zhang Jinhai went in alone and scored again, making it 2-0. However, Cao Qiuting was already offside when the Jewish team conceded this goal, but the referee did not notice it. After that, the Jewish players experienced a psychological breakdown, resulting in a disorganized formation, which Xingdao took advantage of. By the thirtieth minute, Zhang Jinhai scored another goal, making it 3-0. Five minutes before the end of the first half, Jewish player Stan En passed the ball to Fu En in the center, who shot powerfully, but Zhu Zhaoheng's movements were clumsy, allowing them to pull back one goal, making it 3-1. Shortly after, Xu Jingcheng injured his ankle and left the field. Feng Kunsheng replaced him, and exchanged positions with Jinzai. The first half then ended.

After the break, the two teams switched sides and resumed the match. Taking advantage of the momentum from the first half, Xingdao launched an all-out attack. Cao Qiuting single-handedly broke into the Jewish territory. At a critical moment, McNitty bravely punched the ball out, but it landed at Zhang Jinhai's feet. Zhang Jinhai took the opportunity to shoot powerfully. McNitty thought he was offside and did not try to block the shot, so the ball rolled into the net. The referee ruled it as a goal, making it 4-1. At five minutes, Jewish main player Demanya was injured and left the field, and Fuli Lun entered the field. Xingdao took advantage of their weakness and launched a five-pronged attack, but they couldn't break through. The two sides fought fiercely until the thirty-first minute when He Yingfen successfully launched another sneak attack, making it 5-1. At the last minute, Cao Qiuting went in alone and succeeded immediately, making it 6-1. At thirty-five minutes, Li Zhaorong and Xue Pansiting collided, and the foreign soldier was injured. They had to play with ten men, creating numerous loopholes. At forty-three minutes, Tang Nasi caused a penalty. Zhu Yongqiang scored with one kick, making it 7-1. Three minutes before the end of the match, Li Zhaorong scored again, making it 8-1. Shortly after, the whistle blew, and Xingdao won a major victory over the Jewish team with a score of 8-1.

### Football Association Refuses to Share the Spoils, Referee Angrily Refuses to Officiate

The members of the Football Referees Association did not appear to serve as referees in yesterday's match between Xingdao and Youben, causing suspicion from all circles. Tan Jing, the chairman of the association, made the following statement regarding this matter: "Four weeks ago, our association contacted the Football Committee regarding subsidies for our association. Several members of the Football Committee agreed to bring it up for discussion, but it was shelved. The committee clearly lacks sincerity in cooperating with our association. Therefore, before Xingdao's first appearance, we notified the committee that our association would no longer assign members to serve Xingdao's matches. However, for the match between Xingdao and Hancheng, Association Secretary-General Shao Rugan, Football Committee Chairman Da Qizhao, Committee Member Wang Xinheng, and Secretary-General Zhou Jiaqi discussed with me before the match and promised to raise the issue in the committee meeting. To take the overall situation into consideration, we still sent our members to attend. Unexpectedly, the issue was not brought up for discussion at the committee meeting on the 27th. Therefore, after yesterday afternoon's general meeting of all members of our association, we decided to no longer cooperate with the Football Committee and have already sent a letter to notify the committee. However, there are two points that should be solemnly stated: (1) The current stalemate is purely due to the Football Committee's lack of sincerity in cooperating with our association, and the subsidy is secondary. (2) The unfinished order of this season's league and the Mayor's Cup was handled by our association members who were hired by the committee, and they will still attend to see it through. In addition, we will refuse to cooperate with all other competitions organized by the Football Committee."

### Roosevelt Cup Game, China and U.S. Teams Battle Again Tonight

The Roosevelt Cup China-U.S. basketball game opened at the city stadium the other day. As a result, China defeated the U.S. and won the victory. The second match will be held at the same venue again at 7:30 PM tonight. Zheng Zhifang and Jin Zuotao will be the referees. If China wins again, they will win the cup; otherwise, a third decisive battle will be held the following day to determine who will be the champion. Tickets are sold for 5,000 for the upper level and 8,000 for the lower level, and the proceeds will be used for charitable expenses. Military police must also purchase tickets to enter, and long-term passes are suspended. Ticket sales will begin at 5 PM, and the doors will open at 6 PM. The Gezhi Boy Scouts and military police will maintain order. Before the game, Mayor Wu will be invited to present the Mayor's Cup Class A silver cup because the Class A championship team, the U.S. Navy's Columbus, will be leaving Shanghai shortly, so the award is being given in advance.

In the first match, the Chinese athletes fully demonstrated their superior skills and teamwork. Relying on their concerted efforts, they were able to break through the U.S. military's defense and achieve victory. The lineup arrangement was quite appropriate. With Hualian as the king, supplemented by Liu Fushan and Ma Canxi, the peony and green leaves complemented each other. If Cai Yanxiong's foot injury is healed today, he may as well try to play. Now that China has won the first match, tonight's gains and losses are even more important. It is hoped that the generals will continue to work hard and strive to win two consecutive victories against the U.S. military and win the cup. The U.S. military is represented by Columbus, so not only is its combat power formidable, but its cooperation is also seamless. Ash possesses skilled game skills, and his shots are accurate. The fans unanimously praised him as the most dangerous person. Players such as Bloary and Johnson are also intelligent and courageous, and are top-notch talents. Since the U.S. military lost in the opening battle, they will definitely seek revenge when they meet again today. It is predicted that there will be an even more intense and fierce competition with our Chinese team at that time. A bloody battle is inevitable. The lineups of the two teams are as follows:

(Chinese Team) Li Zhenzhong (Captain), Kong Guangyi, Bao Songyuan, Ren Xiangcheng, He Lide, Wu Chengzhang, Yang Weicong, Yao Wenyi, Ma Canxi, Zhu Mingxing, Chen Xuechong, Chen Qingjiang, Cai Yanxiong, Liu Fushan.

(U.S. Team) Bloary, Big Johnson, Little Johnson, Ash, Polavete, Oberang, Bonat, Qu Linghuo, Cobb, Bock, Xiong Luoning, Lesmi, Koenig, Langen.

### Football Affairs on the Island are Languid, South China's Morale is Depressed

The football league has reached the end of the season, and most of the battles are unimportant. Three Class A matches were held on the 26th (Saturday), and only China won, while South China and Eastern lost.

On the South China field, Eastern first lost to the Deyun team 2-0. South China then played and was defeated by the Air Force 3-2. Although South China's lineup was incomplete, the Air Force was not a strong team either. The reason for the loss was depressed morale, and there is nothing to say! Only China defeated the stubborn British 42nd Battalion at the Hong Kong venue, which is commendable. The score was three to zero.

For Xingdao's expedition to Shanghai, the team's main player, "Magic Leg" Feng Jingxiang, did not go to Shanghai to supervise the battle because he had an accumulation of blood and needed to recuperate in order to prepare to lead the army on a long trip to England. Xingdao has now won this year's double championship. The awards ceremony will be held on May 4th, with the champion playing against the league team.

### Hong Kong People Think the Vietnamese Team's Style is Too Barbaric

[Our newspaper's Hong Kong airmail] In the Vietnamese football team's last match in Hong Kong, they played against Hualian on the 24th. Because Hualian's main force, Xingdao, had a trip to Shanghai, they were unable to send players, and the lineup was not ideal.

At the start of the match, Hualian took advantage of the wind and Liu Rongguang kicked one into the army. Shi Jin scored a penalty, taking the lead with a score of 2-0 in the first half.

Switching sides, the Vietnamese team gained the wind and, combined with their speed, they scored three goals in five minutes, turning defeat into victory. Afterwards, the Vietnamese team scored two more goals, and Hualian also scored one, making it 5-3, with the Vietnamese team winning the final victory.

Overall, the Vietnamese team's four matches were half wins and half losses, which is not a bad result. The general impression of Hong Kong people is that the whole team's barbaric style is too strong. In the last match, Li Wenya even laid his hands on Xie Jinhe, which is absolutely not in the spirit of sports. As a visiting team, they should not have performed in such a way.

Recently, there has been light rain, which has affected the progress of football events. After the Vietnamese basketball team arrived in Hong Kong, the schedule has been repeatedly delayed since their victory over Da Zhonghua. The second act was only able to continue at Jiaoshan on the 25th. The opponent was the Zhongqing team. There were few spectators, and only eleven tickets were sold.

In this battle, Zhongqing only had five players on the field, and Zhong Zhiqiang and Xin Zhongjian were also short of breath. The Vietnamese team should have won the victory, but they lost 39-38, which was disappointing.

### Although the Social Affairs Bureau Raised the Dumping Price Yesterday, the Limit Price of White Rice Remains Unchanged

The Prices of Edible Oil, Flour, Grains, etc. All Rise Together

[Reported by this newspaper] The rice market situation has not improved. Although general rice shops are still open as usual, most of them have no rice to supply. Those that do have mostly sell red Xian and broken rice. White rice can mostly only be found on the black market. The authorities are paying close attention to the phenomenon that 9,000 bags of rice are dumped daily, but the rice shops in the market have no goods to supply. They are deeply concerned that unscrupulous rice merchants are playing tricks and are currently sending personnel to secretly investigate. Regarding the overall supply and sales of the rice market and the price in the production areas, a comprehensive decision can be made after Mayor Wu attends the National Price Conference and returns to Shanghai this morning. A total of 2,140 stones arrived at the north and south markets yesterday. No transactions were made in white rice. The Social Affairs Bureau dumped a total of 9,000 bags of white rice and Siamese rice yesterday, at a price of 147,000 yuan, which is 11,500 yuan higher than the previous 135,500 yuan. According to Ji Mingzhai, the chief of the Food Section, the reason for this is that the municipal government's order for rice merchants to reduce the door sales limit price of 168,000 yuan was unsuccessful, so the dumping price was increased, while the door sales limit price remained at 168,000 yuan.

Yesterday, the prices of flour, oil, grains, etc. all rose together. The price of soybean oil from this factory was 550,000 yuan, up 15,000 yuan. The price of Qingdao Ji barrel raw oil was 580,000 yuan, up 30,000 yuan from yesterday. The price of pure raw oil was 530,000 yuan, up 30,000 yuan. The price of agar was 117,000 yuan, up 10,000 yuan. The price of local flour was 81,500 yuan, up 2,500 yuan. The price of bran was 63,000 yuan, up 3,500 yuan. The price of Qingdao raw peanuts was 300,000 yuan, up 10,000 yuan. The price of Dalian green beans was 160,000 yuan, up 4,000 yuan. The price of Dalian Yuan beans was 163,000 yuan to 170,000 yuan, up about 5,000 yuan. The price of Ningbo picked white broad beans was 195,000 yuan, up 5,000 yuan.

Also, the oil market could not keep up with sales and was extremely profitable. The soaring trend was very sharp, with prices rising sharply by 20,000 to 30,000 yuan. At noon, Wang Zhongqing, the leader of the economic supervision group of the Oil High Industry Association, instructed Zhang Chao, the chairman of the board of directors, to find a way to stabilize oil prices.

Also, Huang Jiaju, a specialist commissioner of the municipal government, and Wu Yimin, an inspector from the Social Affairs Bureau, investigated the sales situation of various rice shops in the Hongkou area yesterday. The general situation was very good. It was said that a few rice shops did not keep accounts, so there was no way to audit them, and it was heard that a report will be submitted for verification and handling.

### As the Deferred Settlement Draws Near and Credit Tightens, Bullish Traders in Chinese Stocks Emerge

Number 205, 185, 223, 8, 144, 94, and 160 sold out from 5,030 yuan, and the price gradually fell to 4,870 yuan. Numbers 153, 232, 94, 231, 13, and 186 took in at low prices and rose to 5,000 yuan. Numbers 36, 117, 76, and 131 sold again at high prices. The price of Meiya Match also rose to the limit, without much impact. Yong Yarn was sold in sets and then forced down to around 4,870 yuan. After that, a range-bound pattern formed. Number 97 bought in, and numbers 180 and 190 sold out, without much special change.

### The Stock Exchange Denies Stopping Deferred Settlement

It is claimed that deferred settlement was submitted for approval in advance, and so far, no order to stop deferred settlement has been received. Regarding the auction of U.S. dollar bonds, the Exchange authorities expressed a warm welcome. They have already opened a trading place on the second floor, and more than 40 brokers are available. In the future, when the auction officially opens, the number of brokers will definitely increase. In short, all preparations for the auction of U.S. dollar bonds are ready. Once the authorities order it, it can be implemented at any time.

In addition to loading more than 1,500 pieces of groceries, there were also 1,210 pieces of cotton yarn. It is said that the yarn was purchased by the British government in Hong Kong from the China Textile Company.

### Yarn Prices Firm

The yarn market opened flat yesterday. Later, scattered households had a very strong appetite, and the guest brokers saw the low price and added to their purchases. The destocking was smooth, and the market price immediately turned from hovering to rising. Various yarn companies traded vigorously because the period for the authorities to order the clearing of existing yarn was about to expire. More than 700 bales were traded. The prices of 42-count and 20-count yarn rose by 200,000 to 300,000 yuan, while the prices of 16-count yarn saw mixed gains and losses.

### The Rising Wind of Cotton Cloth Has Not Been Restrained

### UNRRA Transports Cotton to China, Totaling 110,000 Bales

### Flour Industry Requests Government to Quickly Resolve Raw Material Supply

Wheat Purchasing Loans Have Been Temporarily Suspended

Yesterday, the person in charge of the flour industry association told reporters: In the past, during this lean season, our country's wheat supply relied on imported wheat to keep factories running. Now, the stock in the producing areas is very small, and there is no news of imported wheat, resulting in two major characteristics in the domestic wheat market: exceptionally high prices and an unexpectedly long supply period. This year's international wheat production is a bumper harvest. The purchasing department of the China Trust Bureau has ordered 100,000 tons of wheat from Argentina through the International Grain Conference, and negotiations are actively underway, with a decision expected in the near future. Recently, the price ratio of wheat to flour in the international market has been 1:1.52. Yesterday, the price of Wuxi wheat in China was 2120 yuan per pound, and the price of flour was 1880 yuan per pound, a ratio of 1:1.32, which is lower than the standard in the foreign market. Moreover, currently 1.5 bags of flour can be exchanged for one shi of Xian rice, making it difficult for flour mills to operate. This is not just a problem in Shanghai. The new wheat will not be available for another two months, and the supply in this city urgently needs to be resolved. For various reasons, factories have temporarily suspended using the wheat purchasing loans from the authorities. What the factories are now requesting from the government is not to increase legal profits, but the problem of raw materials. Mayor Wu will raise this for discussion at the upcoming national price conference. In the future, the allocation may be entirely supplied by the Ministry of Food. If so, the quota will be reduced again.

### Hangzhou Rice Market Exhausted

[Our Newspaper Hangzhou 29th Telegram] The Hangzhou rice market is surging. The Food Review Council has legally set the price of white rice at 160,000 yuan per dan. On the 28th, the price of Xiashi rice tended to fall. On the 29th, the price of coarse rice in the suburbs of Hangzhou suddenly rose to 220,000 yuan. The Hangzhou rice market is again without rice, and the baskets are empty.

### Tianjin Grain Prices Soar

[Our Newspaper Tianjin 29th Telegram] Grain prices in Tianjin have been rising continuously for several days, setting an alarming record today. Shoufeng flour is 150,000 yuan per small bag, retail rice is 3,000 yuan per jin, and corn flour is 1,000 yuan per jin. People in the streets and lanes are sighing about the grain price problem.

### Sugar Prices Rise Across the Board

Yesterday, the sugar market continued to tighten due to the scarcity of spot goods. Peruvian fine sand initially rose by 10,000 yuan, then by 120,000 yuan, already exceeding the 400,000 yuan mark. Other white sugars also rose across the board following the rise of local sugar. Shantou Qing was 265,000 yuan, Huanggang Qing was 260,000 yuan, Shunde Qing was 250,000 yuan, and Diao Qing was 244,500 yuan. Xinghua white bagged was 370,000 yuan, and louvered was 360,000 yuan. Xing red was 267,000 yuan, and Hainan red was 225,000 yuan to 235,000 yuan, an increase of 10% or so.

### Export Tea Flat and Weak

Yesterday, buyers in the foreign tea market were still selective, while sellers, due to cost considerations, were unwilling to reduce prices further. As a result, the outcome of negotiations between the two parties tended to be a stalemate. Only Wang Yutai and Wu Chang Tea Company slightly touched the Qi Men tea from the third batch of the 35th year, while the rest were quiet. Prices remained unchanged. The sales of various domestic teas were also lackluster, and the process was unusually calm. However, the Yingkou gang suddenly showed a good appetite for last year's Bailin black tea, and trading revived. By the close of the market, more than 1,000 boxes had been traded, with prices ranging from 170,000 yuan to 220,000 yuan per dan. With the situation in balance, the price remained stable. Also, new Longjing tea from various routes in Hangzhou has arrived in large quantities recently, but the quality is deteriorating day by day. Competitors are frequently lowering prices, but confidence remains, and the market atmosphere is still ostensibly falling but secretly stable.

### Kerosene Price Increases

The price of kerosene has recently risen sharply due to the scarcity of company allocations, resulting in a shortage of spot goods in the manager's offices. It is said that some dealers have received bulk kerosene at a price of 460,000 yuan per barrel, plus 18,000 yuan for the iron can. Therefore, the selling price of canned kerosene has suddenly increased, reaching 70,000 yuan yesterday.

### Longan and Lychee Are Both Expensive

Due to the lack of new arrivals of miscellaneous longan, the market situation is tightening again. A small number of lots were opened yesterday, and the price rose by slightly less than 10%. The price of ordinary dried longan also broke the one million yuan mark, and the price of Lanzhu lychee rose by 10% to 20%.

### National Textile Association to Hold Annual Meeting Tomorrow

The 12th annual meeting of the National Textile Industry Association will be held tomorrow (May 1st) at Yi Garden. Representatives from various regions have already registered, and the proposals submitted are being reviewed in groups by the meeting. After several discussions, the association itself also plans to submit three proposals: (1) Oppose the import of Japanese cotton textile products to China, (2) Increase the production of domestic cotton, and (3) Improve regulatory measures. These proposals will be submitted to the central authorities after being passed by the general assembly as recommendations for the national textile industry.

### Rationed Sugar Starts May 1st, Priced at 2,100 Yuan Per Jin

The rationing of sugar in this city will officially resume on May 1st. The rationing method is the same as last time. The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau has designated more than 370 Southern goods stores to be responsible for the supply, with each person limited to one jin per month. Sugar purchase certificates will be issued to each household by the Bao Tian staff. After the Southern goods stores purchase the sugar, they will settle accounts with the Taiwan Sugar Company based on the purchase certificates. The price of sugar this time is set at 2,100 yuan per jin, and the Taiwan Sugar Company sells it to the Southern goods stores at 1,725 yuan per jin, allowing the Southern goods stores to earn a profit of 375 yuan. The city has a population of 3.5 million people, and 3.5 million jin will be rationed this time.

### Finance Vice Minister Xu Baiyuan Elaborates on the Loan Situation of the Four Joint Offices

Total Amount Approximately 800 Billion to 1 Trillion Yuan

[Our Newspaper News] Finance Vice Minister Xu Baiyuan made extensive replies to questions raised by various newspapers at a press conference hosted by the United Credit Information Center yesterday. The main points are recorded as follows:

(A) Regarding the types and amounts of loans that have been approved by the Four Joint Offices, Mr. Xu, to the best of his memory, mentioned eleven types and their approximate loan amounts: (1) Loans for state-owned industrial and mining enterprises, approximately 200 billion yuan. (2) Loans for private industrial and mining enterprises, approximately 100 billion yuan. (3) Loans for transportation enterprises, 150 billion yuan. (4) Loans for public utility enterprises, 50 billion yuan. (5) Loans for export trade materials, the total amount is approximately 200 billion yuan. (6) Coal mine loans, the total amount is approximately 20 billion yuan. (7) Grain industry loans, the total amount is approximately 30 billion yuan. (8) Agricultural loans, the total amount is approximately 300 billion yuan or more. (9) Loans for local government finances, the total amount is from 25 billion to 30 billion yuan. (10) Loans for cultural and educational enterprises, the total amount is approximately 30 to 40 billion yuan. (11) Salt loans, the total amount is approximately 200 billion yuan.

(B) The total amount of the various loans mentioned above that have been approved is approximately 800 billion yuan to 1 trillion yuan. Most of the various loans that have been approved and released by the Four Joint Offices in the past have been repaid on time. The only significant bad debt is a loan applied for by the national industrial and commercial circles in the rear after the victory due to the general decline in prices, which has not yet been repaid and has been extended.

(C) One-quarter of the production loans approved last year have now been recovered. It is found that most of these loans are about to mature. The Four Joint Offices stipulate that loans with a term of three months can be extended for one month. Loans with a term of six months cannot be extended again.

(D) A total of more than 1,800 loan applications were approved by the Four Joint Offices last year, and nearly 600 have been approved this year.

(E) The working principles of the Four Joint Offices and the Central Bank's Rediscount Committee do not conflict. The Four Joint Offices are responsible for the allocation of funds for loans issued by various banks and bureaus, while the National Bank Rediscount Committee is responsible for the allocation of funds in the general market. Therefore, the work of the two is complementary and mutually supportive.

(F) The first step in solving the price problem is still to reduce interest rates, and at the same time, speculation should be stopped. If this can be done, the Central Bank can supply sufficient funds to productive enterprises, making productive enterprises more active.

### Shanghai Gold and Silver Jewelry Industry Association Established

The Shanghai Gold and Silver Jewelry Industry Association held its inaugural meeting at the auditorium of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday. More than 100 member representatives attended.

### Shanghai and Hong Kong Tung Oil Export Statistics for the Past Three Months

[Our Newspaper News] It is reported that the total amount of tung oil exported from Shanghai and Hong Kong to various parts of the world in January, February, and March of this year has reached 20,168.60 tons (each ton is equal to 2,240 pounds). Among them, the export volume in January was particularly large, and then decreased month by month. It is reported that since the end of March, due to the inverted domestic and foreign market prices of tung oil, it has been impossible to export. The US market price has gradually fallen from 38 cents per pound to less than 30 cents. The normal price is no more than 34 cents at most. Furthermore, the consumption of tung oil in various European and American countries has decreased sharply after the war. Taking the United States as an example, the monthly consumption before the war was 5,000 tons per month, but now it is only 2,500 tons per month. Moreover, after the war, the United States has become accustomed to using tung oil substitutes, which has invisibly reduced the demand for tung oil. However, the monthly amount of tung oil exported to the United States in the three months has been more than 4,000 to 5,000 tons. Therefore, the overseas market price cannot be boosted for a while. The quantities of tung oil exported from Shanghai and Hong Kong to foreign countries in the past three months are listed as follows (unit: ton):

14 tons, Europe a total of 1904 tons, the United Kingdom a total of 2550 tons, and the total amount of exports from Shanghai and Hong Kong to the world in January, February, and March was 20,169 tons.

### Yan'an's "Maginot Line" - Notes from Northern Shaanxi (4)

— Special Correspondent of This Newspaper, Qun Hua

Yan'an, 16th Quick Report

Since the breakdown of peace talks, Zhou Enlai hurriedly returned to Yan'an. Mao Zedong convened an enlarged military emergency meeting of cadres. Zhou made a grand speech, shouting "Expand the War of Liberation." The CCP had already issued a general mobilization order and an evacuation order on November 15th of last year, actively preparing for war. The able-bodied men in each county were all formed into teams. Those who were slightly trained and physically strong were either formed into smoke-drying teams or expanded into independent teaching brigades. Those who were older or considered unreliable were formed into self-defense teams, stretcher teams, and transportation teams. The core teams and above were all equipped with better weapons. The self-defense teams and below were equipped with inferior weapons, but it has been achieved to the extent that all able-bodied men have been armed. In addition to being armed, the cadres of the organs were also intensifying air defense education, especially the defense against paratroopers, which was explained and rehearsed practically every day. After early March, the situation became tense, and there was almost no day that they did not go up the mountain to be on air alert, as if facing a formidable enemy. At the same time, they actively increased their troops. Chen Geng, Xiao Jinguang, and other units were successively transferred back from the Hebei-Shandong-Henan area. Finally, He Long also moved his troops. In total, they mobilized troops, including militiamen, with a total of three divisions, thirteen brigades, fourteen independent regiments, and ten detachments, totaling more than 160,000 people. They also established a Border Region Defense Mobilization Committee and convened a mass meeting in early March to announce an emergency mobilization, calling for resolutely "Defending Yan'an." All the old and weak were moved to the rear, the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region government moved to Anzhai, and the CCP Central Committee moved to Wayaobao. The families and food supplies—especially opium—were transported and stored in Bao'an. Their determination to fight with their backs to the city and attempt to lure the National Army deep into the outer areas of Yan'an in order to complete their defense war can be said to have been poured out with all their efforts.

In addition, a widespread policy of clearing the fields and fortifying the walls was implemented. In the area south of Yan'an, all grains and livestock that could be used for the National Army's military needs were moved away. The people were coerced to evacuate, and their furniture and utensils were used by their troops to cook or were converted into stretchers. Therefore, when the National Army first arrived, nine out of ten houses were empty, and the suffering of the people was beyond description. Although this caused difficulties for the National Army, the CCP's failure was doomed here.

Although the rapid recovery of Yan'an was a success of a surprising and decisive strategy of attacking its unpreparedness, the CCP is experienced in mobile warfare. Why could it not turn defeat into victory and lose so miserably? Northern Shaanxi has such favorable geographical conditions, and the CCP is good at internal warfare. If it was just a mistake in military deployment, the CCP could definitely change it quickly after discovering it. Moreover, Mao Zedong and Zhu De had no intention of withdrawing from Northern Shaanxi at all. Instead, they attempted to annihilate the main force of the National Army near Yan'an. However, in the actual development, the CCP lost so badly that it could not stop its feet, and there was not even a single counterattack. What is the reason for this?

From the accounts of the people and those who surrendered, we have already discovered that the recapture of Yan'an was two-thirds due to the CCP's own political "mistakes." Military mistakes were only the catalysts.

The CCP has always guided military affairs with politics and determined military strategy and tactics based on political conditions. This time, the erroneous application of strategy and tactics was no exception. Mao Zedong had no doubt in his mind about the loyalty and revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses in Northern Shaanxi, whom he had nurtured and taught for thirteen years, and the so-called production troops of the 120th Division, the 358th Brigade, and the 359th Brigade, whom he regarded as confidants. He firmly believed that, based on these estimates, in politics, he could definitely ensure that the National Army's attack on Yan'an, like the previous encirclement and suppression in Jiangxi, would encounter enemies everywhere, be ambushed everywhere, and eventually be destroyed under the joint counterattack of the so-called revolutionary soldiers and civilians. Surrender, non-resistance, and collapse would never happen. The National Army would not know the situation of the defense lines and remote dangerous areas. Therefore, when they withdrew from Yan'an, they did not destroy anything. They firmly believed that Yan'an would never be lost, or even if it was temporarily lost, it would be recovered quickly. Therefore, they had a plan to lure the "enemy" deep and attempt to annihilate the National Army near Yan'an. But they were completely wrong.

Under their opium economic policy, the cadres became rich and became confused about the revolution. How could those old cadres from peasant backgrounds have the same experience and insight as Mao Zedong? What did they get after more than ten years of arduous struggle? So they boldly embezzled and had some secret money—opium and gold. They wavered, but could not decisively break off organizational ties. Thus, they were contradictory and hesitant, and their encirclement, surrender, and capture were doomed. This time, the 358th and 359th Brigades, the production troops specializing in planting opium, had a particularly large number of captives and lost particularly miserably—Zhu De cried loudly because of this—which is clear evidence.

What about the people? They naturally cannot recognize the planting of opium as revolutionary production, and they are very disgusted with its occupation of land and failure to produce staple foods. Although some people have gained some benefits from fighting landlords and seizing grain and giving land to people (conscription), they have to pay a life, make countless enemies, and do countless things against their conscience. The conservative peasants always have an unspeakable contradiction in their hearts.

In addition, unconditional pro-Soviet and anti-Americanism, forcibly linking anti-Americanism and pro-Sovietism with patriotism, equating the separatist "mountain king" practice with "democracy," mixing war and peace together, and pinning hopes for victory on unreliable Soviet aid are also the most doubtful things for its cadres and the masses, which directly and indirectly affect its combat effectiveness and the intensity of mobilization.

This time, the main forces of the Communist Army's 358th and 359th Brigades were completely destroyed, and the number of prisoners reached more than 13,000. The entire military was inevitably panic-stricken, so the National Army took advantage of the victory and advanced, invincible. Of course, without the heroic struggle of the National Army soldiers, without the ingenious strategy of Chief Hu and Chief of Staff Sheng, and the resolute advance through dangerous terrain, unexpectedly, to the area between the Yichuan-Yanhe and Luochuan-Yan'an lines, encircling and annihilating the Maginot Line of Da and Xiao Laushan, it would not have been possible.

To be honest, the retreat was planned, but the abandonment was not. That is to say, Mao Zedong and his colleagues had no intention of fundamentally withdrawing from Northern Shaanxi. The retreat was only one of the combat procedures to avoid bombing losses and lure the "enemy" deep. It only showed their determination to use Yan'an as a pocket and prepare to launch a fierce annihilation war near Yan'an.

This is a strange and thought-provoking thing: except for the library behind the central auditorium of Yangjialing, the rest of the buildings in Yan'an were not damaged at all. The residences, beds, tables, screens, sofas, and cabinets of Mao Zedong and other important CCP figures were not moved away. Only the bedding on the beds, the springs and covers on the sofas, the lining cloth on the screens, and the books on the bookshelves were taken away. Why didn't Yan'an clear the fields and fortify the walls? Was it left for General Hu Zongnan to enjoy, to curry favor? There is no better explanation than the hurried retreat.

The offensive and defensive battle of Yan'an was first started by the CCP. Most of the CCP troops that started the battle were transferred back from the Shanxi-Suiyuan area. Since they were prepared to retreat, why did they have to transfer them from thousands of miles away? Furthermore, the strategic position of the Northern Shaanxi area is extremely important. General Hu Zongnan's hundreds of thousands of troops have been constrained by it for many years. In terms of geographical situation, it is "easy to attack and easy to defend" and it is a barrier to Shanxi. Mao Zedong would never be so stupid as to present this "Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region" with great strategic significance with both hands and let Hu Zongnan bite himself. Why was he chased so badly that he couldn't stop himself, and even took away valuable and necessary things such as broadcasting stations, printing presses, and printing types? And why didn't the arsenal in Bao'an move away in advance? Is this what a planned abandonment and retreat looks like?

He Long and his chief of staff issued the Zuo Zi No. 14 circular, instructing the Communist Army to defend Yan'an to the death, which is an indisputable fact. In the Battle of Da and Xiao Laushan, four regiments of the Communist Army were annihilated, which also shows their desperate fight. Mao Zedong did not retreat until the 17th, and Zhu De tearfully went north a few hours before the fall of Yan'an. All of these prove that the so-called planned abandonment of Yan'an is not the case, but being beaten to the point of fleeing in panic is 100% true.

The demeanor of Director Chen hosting reporters (Special correspondent Jiang Muyun's photo)

### Chief Executive Chen Yi's Farewell to Reporters

— Special Correspondent Jiang Muyun of this Newspaper

Taiwan, 23rd Dispatch

At the Executive Yuan's regular meeting on April 22nd, it was decided that Chief Executive Chen Yi would leave Taiwan, relinquishing the position of the first chief executive after its restoration.

The reporters enthusiastically suggested to the two directors of the newsroom, Zhang Yanzhe and Shen Yunlong, that the Chief Executive should grant the reporters a conversation. They gladly agreed to forward the request, and thus our "farewell conversation" with Chief Executive Chen Yi was arranged.

Implementing New Policies, Powerful Reactionary Forces

At 3 p.m. on the 24th, the figure of an old man with auburn-colored suit, temples gray, and face flushed appeared at the Taipei Guest House. He still walked with vigor, greeting the reporters with gleaming eyes. He nodded, saying that the exchange rate of 40 New Taiwan Dollars to 1 Old Taiwan Dollar had been decided, a result he had obtained with great difficulty from the central government.

The reporters were eager to hear his reflections on his year and a half governing Taiwan. He said, "Objectively speaking, many things have not been accomplished. There are many reasons for this, due to environmental factors, which are not easy to discuss now."

With deep-seated pain, he cited historical facts to illustrate the growth of reactionary forces. He listed examples from the Qin, Han, and Song dynasties, noting that the implementation of new policies invariably encountered strong opposition. Although these new policies eventually succeeded. He pointed out that three types of people are targeted: first, progressive figures who strive to change the environment; second, bad people and treacherous officials; and third, the majority who are neither good nor bad, silent, writing beautiful articles and saying beautiful things. These people have been insignificant in the historical tradition of the past two thousand years because of the cyclical nature of history. However, this is no longer acceptable today; we need leniency and progress. He further used England as an example to illustrate the power of the majority of the people, while the Soviet government can control its population. In China, a policy that benefits the majority of the people may not necessarily gain their support. However, when it conflicts with the interests of a small number of special classes of landlords and gentry, the power of these reactionary forces is considerable, and it is impossible to prevent them. Therefore, he firmly believes that progress requires fearlessness of suspicion and jealousy, cultivating a spirit of fearlessness of sacrifice, and the support of public opinion.

Two New Tasks, Willing to Dedicate to the New Chairman

The Chief Executive had ideals and aspirations for governing Taiwan and expressed satisfaction with the work that the cadres should do. The provincial finance suffered a deficit last year, but a large asset was left behind. The new chairman need not worry about finance. Regarding public enterprises, monopolies, and trade, he simply said, "If we don't do it, the finance will be terrible, factories won't be smoking, schools won't be open, and over six hundred water conservancy projects cannot be done, and the people's taxes will not be bearable." He did not elaborate on the external criticism of "tight economic control and loose political control," stating his dilemma as "it looks tight, but it really can't not be done."

Two things were planned for the second half of the year in his governance plan for Taiwan. First, of the 106,000 people returning from overseas and the mainland, half are unemployed, and he was determined to give them engineering team status to engage in construction work. Second, for children who are out of school, give them the skills to make a living. He advocated nine years of compulsory education, three years equivalent to junior high school level, and after graduation, they can find jobs in various professional sectors. This plan was obviously thwarted, but he is willing to dedicate it to the new chairman for implementation.

He also frankly stated that dealing with the pro-Japanese gentry, members of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association, bad ruffians, and smuggling is impossible. China has no laws that can serve as the basis for strict punishment or banishment to Green Island. Sending them to court would result in a detention of two or three months at most, and then they would be released. This kind of jurisprudence that does not fit the facts only forces everyone not to do things seriously. It is difficult to demand progress and political reform in this environment.

Regarding the Press, Self-Recognized Old Habits

The most concerned reporters at the meeting were their own personal matters. The Chief Executive emphasized: he believes in freedom, and for a year and a half, he has supported the freedom of speech, assembly, and publication. He talked about freedom, and as a result, the 228 incident occurred. This kind of detached freedom should be changed and compensated as soon as possible. He attaches importance to the press, and the press should also respect itself. He further affirmed that it is difficult to assign a propaganda agency to take sole responsibility for the overall propaganda task. It is necessary for everyone to cooperate, pay attention to many aspects, concentrate on doing it on a large scale, do more construction work, not harbor leadership desires, and serve everyone.

Director Ye of the Central News Agency, based on the Chief Executive's attitude towards the press when he governed Fujian, asked him to recall what he said when he came to Taiwan, "Try to adopt it according to the situation," and re-examine it. He said, "I made the old mistake." Then: "In Fujian at that time, many people could not understand me, but after I left, they missed me. This is not a gain or loss for individuals or groups, but a loss for the country."

In his vision, he firmly believes that the future of Taiwan, this Chinese territory, is bright. He loves Taiwan and cares for the vast majority of kind Taiwanese compatriots. Public opinion should give spiritual comfort to those who are hard-working researchers and experimenters. Blindly accusing corruption only increases uneasiness. Throughout his life, he is not afraid of difficulties, not afraid of grievances, and does not know discouragement. This time leaving Taiwan, his active spirit is the same as when he came.

Chief Executive's Office, Will Become a Historical Relic

At the same time, after the Chief Executive and the reporters finished taking pictures in front of this newspaper's camera, they shook hands and said goodbye one by one. We watched his resolute, calm, wise, and solid back leaving in the pouring rain. Everyone is anticipating the disappearance of the "Chief Executive's Office" and the title of "Chief Executive" in one or two weeks when the new Provincial Chairman arrives. Chief Executive Chen Yi will also temporarily leave Taiwan at this time.

Will the Chief Executive's face and style give people memories and love like when he governed Fujian? Will the fact of governing Hebei for a year and a half be used as the main evaluation in his political life? Is the economic policy that he insisted on implementing a success or a failure? And is the 228 incident the fault of him and his cadres alone? ... In these questions, the answer that the reporter can get is that in the current situation of political turmoil and the country's failure to achieve unity, an administrative worker with ideals who is diligent, self-motivated, and loyal to the nation, when implementing policies that benefit the majority of people, is first sacrificed because he cannot prevent the waves of reactionary forces and cannot win the support of the majority of people. The price is: giving later comers and the country a severe lesson.

Obviously, in his bloody and tearful conversation, his pain is greater than the feelings he expressed. The reporters will watch Chief Executive Chen Yi leave in a hurry, and will also welcome the arrival of the new chairman with new aspirations. It is truly full of emotion, regret, and hope!

The Chief Executive's Office, the political hub of Taiwan Province, will soon be changed to the Provincial Government. (Special Correspondent Jiang Muyun)

### Please Round Off Fares for City Transportation

Dear Editor: The sections of Yichang Road and West Suzhou Road are densely packed with factories, and the traffic is important. However, the roads are damaged and uneven. After it rains, puddles form, and mud splashes everywhere, making it unbearable. In the past, there were Route 19 and Route 21 trolleybuses running between Sanyangjing Bridge and the Mint Bridge at the bottom of Gordon Road. After the Japanese invaders occupied the concession, they dismantled the electric wires in order to collect materials. More than a year and a half has passed since the restoration, but the tram company has not yet restored the lines. Currently, to catch a bus, one must go to the intersection of Changshou Road and Jiangning Road or the Big Bell, which is a hardship for residents and workers traveling back and forth. Therefore, I request the municipal authorities to repair the roads as soon as possible and order the British tram company to find a way to restore the lines or add public buses to facilitate transportation, which would be a great convenience. (Lu Jingqing)

Another Letter: At the intersection of Wusong Road and Qiujiang Road, the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company repaired water pipes a few days ago. The stone road surface was damaged and has not been restored. Passing vehicles are often in danger of overturning. I implore the wise authorities to send personnel to survey and repair it as soon as possible to benefit the people's travel. (Du Lian)

### Please Prohibit Stalls in Front of Schools

The hardship of hawker life is well known, especially the great uproar caused by the authorities' crackdown last year, which won the sympathy of the public. However, the location of hawker stalls should be in appropriate places that do not hinder the scenery. If stalls are set up in front of schools, it is not only an inappropriate place but also detrimental to the scenery. The reasons are summarized below:

Schools are institutions for education and should not encourage students to develop wasteful habits. Some schools do not have strict access control, and students can enter and exit freely. If there are snack stalls in front of the school, it is tantamount to encouraging students to waste money and buy unsanitary snacks, which is contrary to the purpose of education. Moreover, some bad stalls even contain the meaning of gambling. The students all gather around these stalls after class, betting their money on them. During class, they have no intention of listening to lectures, and their minds are only on these stalls, which is harmful to the students. I have personally experienced it, so I know the details very well. If foreign guests visit the school and see stalls in front of the school, it will also be detrimental to the scenery. Therefore, I deeply hope that the police will strictly prohibit stalls from setting up stalls in front of schools and hope that the school authorities will prohibit students from entering and leaving freely during class time to emphasize the school spirit and cultivate good and thrifty habits for students. (Zhang Zongli)

### Attention Should Be Paid to Beggars on the Streets

Recently, a large number of "beggars" have been discovered in this city, mostly adults and children, with northern accents. In groups of three or two, they carry monkeys and play suonas and bamboo flutes, begging from door to door. As one group leaves, another group arrives within twenty minutes, flowing incessantly and scattered on various streets. In the past, beggars were only seen in the vicinity of the Red Temple, except in the Nanjing Road and Bund Huangpu areas. However, this has changed in the past two months. These beggars push open the doors of large businesses and offices in the Nanjing Road and Bund areas, begging while playing instruments, ignoring the scenery and public order. I hope the authorities will pay attention to this. (Huang Haitao)

### Rescue Out-of-School Children in Shaoxing

Dear Editor: When Yue was occupied, the enemy and puppets were extremely violent. After the victory, the entire countryside was like withered grass and trees, and its vitality could not be restored for a while. Speaking of education, there is no way to raise funds first. Although the county government stipulates that each Bao should run a primary school, it is equivalent to a mere formality. Even if some are reluctantly set up, most parents cannot afford tuition fees or buy books, allowing their children to waste their studies.

Everyone knows that children are the masters of the next generation, and both the country and the family place a hope on them. To achieve this hope, they must be educated. Now, many, many school-age children in Shaoxing are unable to receive education due to economic reasons. How will they be able to assume the responsibility of the master of the country in the future? Therefore, I am writing this letter hoping that social elites will initiate and raise some funds to run several compulsory primary schools in rural areas. This will benefit the children of Yue, which will also benefit the future society and the country. (He Zhongmou)

### Gao Bridge

— Xiang Peiliang

Ascend that Northern Mound, alas! Gaze upon the Imperial Capital, alas! The palaces are magnificent, alas! The toils of the people, alas! Boundless and endless, alas!

This is Liang Hong's Lament Poem, a superlative piece of writing unmatched in ancient and modern times, a kind of bone-chilling, desolate long sigh. At that time, Liang Hong went east out of the pass, passed through Luoyang, and wrote this poem. "Emperor Suzong—Emperor Zhang of the Later Han—heard it and was saddened, but could not find Hong." Because Liang Hong and his wife, Meng Guang, were already pushing a small cart southward along the old route of Taibo and Yu Zhong, and had arrived in Suzhou. After arriving in Suzhou, he lived at Gao Bridge, which was Gao Botong's house. This couple, giving their labor for free, "rented spring," residing under the eaves of the Gao family. In this way, where could Emperor Zhang find him? And I don't know how long it took. Because this couple respected each other as guests, and Meng Guang raised the tray to her forehead. One day, Gao Botong saw it and was shocked, thinking that they must not be ordinary people. After inquiring, he understood the situation and showed great respect. The place name Gao Bridge has been passed down to this day.

Raising the tray to the forehead is a very famous incident. The tray is a food container. When bringing food, one does not casually put it down, but solemnly places it, as if in front of honored guests. This is the original meaning of raising the tray to the forehead. Because it is usually written as "desk," it is misunderstood as the Eight Immortals table. Thus, Meng Guang is made to be incredibly strong, able to lift the table with one hand. However, this joke has been around since ancient times and has long become history.

Entering the city from the Chang Gate, heading east along the road for less than half a kilometer, there is a cement flat bridge. Crossing the bridge is the bus stop. There are electrical shops and fruit shops at the head of the bridge. The form is exactly the most common thing in modern cities, but it is the trace of hermits and poets of 1900 years ago. That is Gao Bridge. Suzhou is the only city in the country that preserves ancient place names. Such as Feng Dou, Xu Gate, Yao Li Fang, Tiger Hill, etc., dating back to 2,500 years. Gao Bridge is not the oldest, of course it has long been unrecognizable now. However, didn't Kong Rong say, "Although there are no old people, there are still models." Didn't the Grand Historian say, "High mountains are looked up to, and great conduct is followed. Although one cannot reach it, one's heart yearns for it." Leaving a few place names, can't it still make future generations look up to, admire, and yearn for it? Does it not give rise to endless imagination?

Gao Bridge is located on West Chang Gate Street. Walking to the end of this small street is the west entrance of Peach Blossom Dock. The area of West Chang Gate Street is a vegetable market in the morning. I take a vegetable basket to the vicinity of Gao Bridge almost half of the days, and I often walk across the bridge. I used to hear people say it was High Bridge and didn't pay much attention to it. Recently, I learned that it was Gao Bridge, which shows how little I read. Afterwards, thinking about it, in Yu Xin's Lament for the South, the two lines "Drifting at the Lower Pavilion, traveling at the High Bridge" are written as "High" Bridge. After that, when I passed the bridge again, I had a different feeling. On the cement railing bridge, cars were driving, and radio receivers were constantly blasting vulgar songs. Underneath is a dirty, stagnant water. In this place, 1900 years ago, a great hermit lived his life, using his life to express an extremely lofty ideal. This kind of behavior, on the surface, seems to be passive, but it has created an unparalleled influence on our culture.

At the time of Emperor Zhang, the Later Han Dynasty was at its peak, Ban Chao was demonstrating his power in the Western Regions, and the politics were still clean. However, historians saw that some bad trends had already been created at that time. Did Liang Hong's Five Litanies come from political foresight, or from a different kind of fundamental insight? The latter seems closer to reality. The tone of this poem is quite subtle, not as激昂 as Jia Yi and Liu Xiang's memorials. However, the emotion is very sad, especially the first and last two sentences. What is Northern Mound? It is the place where high officials and dignitaries have been buried since ancient times. Today, the soldiers are enjoying the magnificent palaces, but perhaps tomorrow they will go to the Northern Mound to be with the dead. And the people's toil does not disappear, but continues from generation to generation. Emperor Zhang was ultimately wise, and "heard it and was saddened."

But emperors and hermits are ultimately in two completely different worlds. Even if his heart beat once, he could not change it. Liang Hong also knew this, so he left quietly, expressing his ideals through action. Therefore, this poem is not only an accusation against politics, but a fundamental opposition to politics. If there is an imperial capital, it cannot but create magnificent palaces, and it cannot but oppress the people and seize their possessions. The people's toil will never end. Then the meaning of this poem is equal to the Western Mountain Song of Boyi, and even more fierce and thorough than Jia and Liu.

Hermitage is a special and great ideal in our country's politics. Figures like Xu You and Wu Guang are difficult to verify, but Boyi and Shuqi are clearly彰彩 and prominent. "Using violence to replace violence, without knowing it is wrong" is a thorough opposition to politics. Regardless of the violence of Jie and Zhou, or the benevolence of Tang and Wu, once politics is involved, it is all the same thing. What is called using extreme benevolence to attack extreme unbenevolence is still a case of violence in the eyes of Yi and Qi, judged by another higher standard. After this, figures like the Hoeing Old Man, Holding the Whip and Watering the Garden, the Madman of Chu Jie Yu, and Chang Ju Jie Ni, even Confucius could not disparage them. He only lamented: "If the world were orderly, I would not change places with you."

I don't know if politics is ultimately the highest realm of mankind. As Aristotle said, man is a political animal. Perhaps this is just a transitional method. Mankind may eventually reach a realm where politics is not needed at all. This is too big a problem to discuss at present. The current fact is: we cannot leave politics, and politics often has shortcomings, even creating evils. Looking at history, it is really impossible to settle the account of whether politics can offset its merits and demerits. Therefore, our country has produced two great political ideals. One is not to disturb the people, the so-called simple government and clear punishment, loose net and wide meshes, reducing the scope of politics. Confucius's theory of "guiding them with virtue and aligning them with rituals" also limits political activities. The other is the idea of hermitage, denying the supreme importance of politics. To use a not-so-accurate metaphor, it is like Stimson's non-recognition doctrine. No matter how轟轟烈烈 you make a fuss, I will ignore it. Even if you succeed, I will always recognize it as violence, then that kind of success will not get a solid foundation and will always be temporary. It seems like this is passive, but it fundamentally destroys the opponent's foundation.

Because of this, our country did not have absolute autocracy until the Yuan Dynasty, when foreign races ruled. The existence of hermitage caused the emperor to lose his supreme position and only obtain a relative position. Nineteen hundred years ago, in the remote and desolate Jiangnan, there were two laborers living in other people's miscellaneous courtyards (people without their own houses at that time were equal to people without houses living on the streets today), earning a living by sweating on their foreheads. But their status was equal to that of the emperor, and their power was equal to that of the emperor. With these kinds of people, the ancient emperors of our country did not dare to do whatever they wanted. People in politics also did not take serving the emperor as their greatest goal. Not serving kings and lords is not only a kind of personal highness. It is a thorough resistance and accusation.

However, in the present day, 1900 years later, the place name Gao Bridge may only have meaning for people who are hurrying on and off buses. Every day, the vehicles on the bridge and the water under the bridge flow separately, and no one will have any associations with such an ordinary white bridge? At this time, perhaps only a few people will not have more or less dissatisfaction with politics. Then, should we, people of this era, learn from Confucius, who thought, "Birds and beasts cannot be associated with, who should I associate with if not with these people?" Therefore, regardless of whether this world is good or bad, we must share a part of the responsibility and share a part of the rights? Or, follow in the footsteps of hermits, resolutely give up all enjoyment and make a thorough accusation? This is to be decided by each person and cannot be forced. But one thing is certain: that is, since you choose to share the enjoyment, you should bear a part of the responsibility, but you cannot just take the enjoyment and then stand aside and say sarcastic remarks.

I take a vegetable basket near Gao Bridge almost half of the days. Whenever I carry a full basket of mustard greens, bamboo shoots, yellow croaker, salted mackerel, etc., and feel that my arm is a little tired, I think that Liang Hong would probably laugh at me. I live in Peach Blossom Dock, but I have neither the talent of Tang Bohu nor his financial resources, so I dare not be unrestrained and romantic. Nor do I have the strength of Liang Hong to earn a living by sweating on my forehead. Therefore, I dare not regard myself as a hermit and must live among the people. Thinking of the words "fearing the head and fearing the tail, the body has little left," I can't help but laugh. Therefore, I don't dare to complain. Only when I occasionally have free time and put down my pen and paper, I can't help but chant the Five Litanies in a long voice and cherish distant reveries.

### The Sequel Writer of "A Flower in a Sinful Sea"

— Shushan

Although the famous novel "A Flower in a Sinful Sea" by Zeng Mengpu, known as the Sick Man of East Asia, was never completed by himself, there had already been two versions made to continue it. According to the "History of Late Qing Dynasty Novels," these were: "One by Lu Shi'e, 'New Flower in a Sinful Sea' (published by the Reformed Novel Society, 1910), and one by Bao Tianxiao, 'Green Blood and Evening Mist' (published in 'Novel Forest'). One was not named, and one was unfinished." Now, there is another "Sequel to A Flower in a Sinful Sea," which was written by Yan Gu Laoren after he fled from his hometown of Changshu to Shanghai during the Anti-Japanese War.

In fact, I have said that the first sequel writer of "A Flower in a Sinful Sea" was none other than the Sick Man of East Asia himself. This is because he said in the preface to the revised edition that the book's creator was "Lover of Freedom" Jin Songcen, and that the first four or five chapters were originally drafted by Jin. As for the Sick Man of East Asia, although he engaged in writing for more than twenty years, in the end, according to his original plan and the complete list of sixty chapters he had drawn up, he only wrote half, and the rest was buried with his death. It is also a pity that "Lover of Freedom" has now passed away, twelve years after the death of the Sick Man of East Asia, and he never wrote a sequel. The sequel writer is Yan Gu Laoren, Zhang Yin'nan.

As for Yan Gu Laoren's sequel, what is it like? Does it continue the unfinished part according to the original plan of the Sick Man of East Asia? Because I have not yet seen his work, I cannot say for sure. Now, I just want to briefly describe this Yan Gu Laoren, who can be said to be qualified to be the sequel writer of "A Flower in a Sinful Sea."

Yan Gu Laoren is also a respected Confucian scholar from Changshu, named Zhang Hong, with the courtesy name Yin'nan. He was about the same age as the Sick Man of East Asia and a childhood friend. In their later years, they lived in the same city, visiting each other from time to time, composing and singing poems together. Zhang's residence, Yan Gu Garden, and Zeng's residence, Xu Wu Ju, both had the beauty of springs, rocks, flowers, and trees. Needless to say, Zhang was very familiar with the characters and stories in "A Flower in a Sinful Sea," and even participated in the writing plan.

In the year before the death of the Sick Man of East Asia, in the spring of the 23rd year of the Republic (1934), because the five southeastern provinces held a transportation exhibition, Changshu County was also included in the scenic area, and he was ordered to organize famous scenic spots and ancient sites. At that time, the county magistrate of the county, Zhou Heng, summoned local gentry after receiving the order, and then proceeded. It was decided to organize the Changshu County Organizing Committee for Scenic Spots, and Zhou County Magistrate was appointed as the chairman (Zhou resigned, and Huan Ji succeeded as county magistrate), Zhang Yin'nan was the vice chairman, and Zhang was also recommended as one of the editors of the tourist guide. This shows his reputation in the local area.

Let me also mention a few examples of Yan Gu Laoren's poems and essays, to get a glimpse. At that time, the "Yushan Tourist Guide" was edited by Pan Jiason, and he also wrote two quatrains for it:

"The ten-mile Yushan has a fresh look, the forests and springs are pointed out by a clear talent; the lofty sentiment is no different from Hanshan, the couple searched meticulously and picked stones."

"The mountain light of Yuling is like a mat, and the waves of Shanghu are as white as silver; it is a pity that such a good secluded place may be invaded by vile people."

His essay, such as the "Inscription for the Huan Cui Small Abode," I went to Changshu with friends last May after the war to visit the park, and rested in the Huan Cui Small Abode, and saw that its wood carvings were still well preserved. The text is as follows:

"Yushan is beautiful, and there is a park in it, close to the steep blue, embracing the green of the forest, the setting sun sends the rosy clouds, and a slight sound is heard; the morning sun fans the harmony, and from time to time the fragrance of grass is teased. There are two or three people, next to the towering oaks, sparse shade through the smoke, the empty window stores the moon, leaning on the railing to offer the flute, and the Oriole's charming voice harmonizes; playing chess, competing with the ants for the road. Occupying the beautiful scenery of the lake and mountains, providing friends with clear talk, initiating a good name, inscribed on the plaque, saying: Huan Cui Small Abode, entrusting me with a note to leave fingerprints. Not relying on the remnants of the past, but borrowing the eternal fragrant box, just to stay the elders, and to wave their words."

In the past, Lu Shi'e and Bao Tianxiao, who wrote sequels to "A Flower in a Sinful Sea," were also famous novelists. The "History of Late Qing Dynasty Novels" also has records of their works.

### Talking About Local Opera

— Dong Meikan

Kunqu Opera ascended to the hall of high culture during the Qing Dynasty and could not enter the so-called vulgar ear. However, all true art should be understood and accepted by the public. Kunqu Opera had already moved away from this basic condition, and its fate was thus decided. During the Qianlong era of the Qing Dynasty, the so-called local operas of various regions rose up to seize the position of Kunqu Opera. At this time, people called Kunqu Opera the "elegant troupe," and all others were classified as "flower troupes." Those wealthy salt merchants hired actors from both troupes to provide entertainment at any time. For example, the "Record of Pleasure Boats in Yangzhou" records:

"The salt affairs of Lianghuai always kept both flower and elegant troupes to prepare for grand operas. The elegant troupe is Kunqu Opera; the flower troupe is Beijing Opera, Qin Opera, Yiyang Opera, Bangzi Opera, Luoluo Opera, and Erhuang Tune, collectively called Luan Tan."

The various tunes of the flower troupe were not actually newly created. Some tunes, such as Yiyang Opera, were popular before Kunqu Opera came into being. During the period of silence, one branch was preserved in the north, and it became Gaoqiang Opera based in Gaoyang, Zhili. There are also other tunes that existed as early as the Ming Dynasty.

Qu Lu: "In recent decades, there have been various tunes from Yiyang, Yidao, Qingyang, Leping, and Huizhou."

Wei Liangfu's words are sufficient to prove this. Of course, the so-called rise of the flower troupe was initially dominated by Qin Opera, Luoluo Tune, and Yiyang Opera. The preface to the "Legend of the Dream in the Dream," which came out in the early Qianlong period, says:

"The pear orchard in Chang'an (referring to the capital) is said to be prosperous… and what they like is only the sound of the Qin Opera, Luoluo Tune, and Yiyang Tune, and they hate listening to Wu Sao (referring to Kunqu Opera). When they hear Kunqu Opera, they disperse in a commotion."

These words prove the fact that the public at that time disliked the "elegant troupe" and liked the "flower troupe." The emperor's feet were mostly nobles and scholar-officials. It had reached this point, and other places must inevitably love the various tunes of the flower troupe, especially the actors from Huizhou in the south. Although there were other operas in the Huizhou troupe, they were mainly Huizhou tunes. Emperor Gaozong of Qing had listened to the various tunes of the flower troupe in the south during his southern tours, and was generally satisfied. In the 55th year of Qianlong (1790), the Huizhou troupe also entered Beijing.

"Dreamy Gossip Records": "Sanqing… In the gengxu year of the 55th year of Qianlong, Gaozong's 80th birthday, they entered the capital to celebrate. At that time, they were called the Sanqing Huizhou troupe, which was the ancestor of the Huizhou troupes."

This celebration was just an excuse to take the opportunity. In fact, they knew that the emperor liked their performances, so they developed to the capital and flourished in a short period of time. By the Jiaqing period, five troupes had been established, including Sanqing, Sixi, Hechun, Chuntai, and Sanhe. Of course, although the names were Huizhou troupes, the actors were not necessarily all from Huizhou. They were from all over the place. In terms of tunes, they changed after arriving in the capital, absorbing the strengths of various tunes. Everyone also learned other tunes such as Beijing Opera, Qin Opera, and Kunqu Opera. Among these five troupes, the four major troupes were the most famous, and each had its own characteristics. According to the "Records of Residual Tears in Jintai," they were roughly:

"Sixi" was called "Quzi" because it originally specialized in Kunqu Opera.

"Sanqing" was called "Zhouzi" and specialized in performing newly arranged contemporary events and continuous operas.

"Hechun" was called "Bazi" and specialized in performing martial arts operas such as the Romance of the Three Kingdoms and the Water Margin.

"Chuntai" was called "Haizi" because it was a children's troupe.

At that time, in addition to performing in halls, the troupes also performed in theaters. It is said that "theaters that perform operas must hire a Huizhou troupe. The larger theaters such as Guangdelou, Guanghelou, Qingleyuan, and Sanqingwei must also be dominated by Huizhou troupes. After this, the Huizhou troupe, the small troupe, and the Western troupe are mixed and suitable."

The fact that these dramas could flourish in the Qing Dynasty naturally had its reasons: First, Emperor Gaozong repeatedly toured the south to investigate the people's sentiments, and he obtained methods of governance—combining leniency and strictness; not only drama, but also the period of brilliant literature was created. Second, as commercial capital became more developed, the number of people in the city who needed entertainment increased. Third, because of the changes in the scholar-official class, psychological development, the actors used the power and money of the scholar-officials, and the scholar-officials played with the actors' beauty. Fourth, because it is human nature to like the new and dislike the old, and the old tunes can no longer entertain people's ears and eyes. The various tunes of the flower troupe flourished for these four reasons, but the value of dramatic art was also lowered as a result.

Until the Xianfeng period, Cheng Changgeng, a native of Anhui, emerged from the Huizhou troupe. Not only was his art superior to his peers, but he was also capable in administration. The good troupe rules of the old troupe were almost all established by him. He was the "big boss" of the Pihuang Opera world, specializing in old male roles, and his singing and acting skills were unmatched at the time. Only Zhang Erkui and Yu Sansheng, who were equally famous as him, stood shoulder to shoulder with him. However, from Qianlong to Daoguang, they were all praised and mocked. Since Changgeng's emergence, he has reversed the evil trend, and this achievement should not be erased. After him, there was Tan Xinpei, who was also a worthy actor. However, the hearts of the petty bourgeoisie for art are not as good as their lust for women. Later, they still mocked and mocked.

### An Inch of Mountain, an Inch of River, an Inch of Blood 409

— Ye Jingfeng

"Birds of a feather flock together, and people gather in groups." Usually, if you want to determine what kind of group a group of people is, whether it is positive, evil, good, bad, ambitious, or decadent, you only need to first listen to their words and then observe each person's attitude and actions, like a qualitative analysis in chemistry, you can at least determine 90% of it. This is to say that it is somewhat inappropriate for the place and time, otherwise it can simply determine 100% of it.

In this group, in terms of age, Li Ming is the eldest, but he is only on the edge of thirty years old. The next is Shouyi, who is exactly twenty-eight years old; then there are Tsurumi and Masa'iwa, both of whom are twenty-six or seven. The youngest is the Korean patriot, who is said to be only twenty-one years old.

Speaking of physique and appearance, Shouyi is the best among the five. It is said that when he was studying in Japan, Japanese women rushed to call him "Beautiful Male God." Among the five, he is also the tallest, about five feet nine inches, standing among ordinary Westerners, and when it comes to physique, no one dares to add the words short and thin to him. Although his figure is so tall, his entire physique has developed so evenly, and it matches the height of his body very well; southern people laugh at thin and long people as "electric wooden poles," and northern Shandong people laugh at flat cake-like "iron towers" and "burly men," etc., but these adjectives cannot be used to describe him. He has that appropriately ideal standard physique.

Speaking of martial arts; in the old style, he is the most proud disciple of Old Man Juechang, and since he started practicing at the age of five or six, he has been on the right track; he has practiced both internal and external skills of Yoben, boxing mothers, and has also practiced Dharma Palm, Toad Gong, Snatching, and the small tricks of dislocating bones and dividing tendons from experts. As for modern Western boxing, fencing, racing, throwing, and throwing, they are just child's play to him. As for shooting, he practiced to the point where he could "hit the target every time," not only without aiming, but also without visual effort. In terms of education, he has a first-class electrical engineering degree from Japan, and two years of practical experience in a radio factory. Because all his qualities are good, and he is naturally gentle, his words and actions are beautiful, and he is so elegant and calm.

As for this young patriot from Korea, he is also well-proportioned and handsome and sturdy. I use the word handsome because he really looks like a delicate woman. However, it is said that his character is more violent than a bomb, and at the same time, he is also proficient in espionage skills. All his actions are mostly simple and honest like most Koreans.

(Here, the author never mentioned the name of this Korean patriot, which is very regrettable; but there are two reasons: First, when Tsurumi narrated the characters of this gathering to me that day, he did not mention the name, and I neglected to ask. Although I want to ask him now, he has run to such a barren place, and he is so decadent, even if I write to ask, I am afraid there will be no result.

Second, after arriving in Shanghai, I met two Korean classmates who were also former Korean revolutionary comrades. I once inquired from them about the name of this young man. It is said that there were several people of the same age and appearance as this young comrade, but one by one, they bled and sacrificed in the underground work during the fall of Shanghai. Some were named Kim, some were named Min, some…etc. The old revolutionary leader on that day had already died of illness, and it was even more impossible to ask about it.)

### Dickens' Speech

— Meng Long

Once, the famous British novelist Dickens gave a speech in Manchester, vigorously attacking the "A Little Learning is Dangerous" theory that was prevalent in society at that time.

He said loudly: "Although houses and land cannot be given to them, knowledge can still give something besides houses and land."

### Elizabeth's Hand

— Youjin

The birthday of Princess Elizabeth, the heir to the British throne, is April 21. She is only 21 years old this year. When the UK held a grand coming-of-age celebration, she broadcast her most beautiful speech to the nation.

This 21-year-old future queen not only has a mouth that can give speeches, but also has hands that can work. After all, times have changed. She no longer prides herself on her noble and jade-like hands, like the ancient Chinese poets who praised the hands of those aristocratic women, saying something like "hands like soft reeds, skin like solidified fat."

What are her hands like? According to a feature article in the report:

"…She sleeps in the palace at night and works in oil and machines during the day. She likes to get her nails dirty and her hands covered in oil, showing off the achievements of her labor to her friends…."

Although this is somewhat close to self-promotion and showing off, her knowledge is correct. When Martin Attlee (the son of British Prime Minister Attlee) stretched out a dirty hand after wiping the floor on a seagoing vessel on the Bund of Shanghai and shook hands with a Chinese reporter, he said; "My hand is too victorious!" These two things clearly have the flavor of mutual reflection. One is the son of the prime minister, and the other is the princess who will inherit the throne. They are both proud of their dirty hands of labor. Compared with the general man who regards fair fingers as noble, and the general woman who regards red nail polish as beautiful, it is completely different.

No matter how far mechanical inventions go, people's working hands will always be valuable. Hard work is not just a matter for our ancestors, it will also be a matter for our descendants. Although "handicrafts" are outdated, working hands are permanently useful. If you only love your delicate hands, let your lover stroke them, and let your distinguished guests shake them, and you "stand by with your hands in your sleeves" for everything you should do, then in the future you will inevitably end up with "nothing to do" no matter what you discuss, or even "waiting for death with your hands tied."

After the British Labor Party came to power, even the hands of Princess Elizabeth, as noble as the heir to the throne, were inevitably those that were proud of labor and had grease on them (not nail polish). This symbolizes the rebirth of Britain and the progress of Britain.

### Revitalizing Morality

— Tang Shan

General He Yingqin gave an interview to the United Press in New York on his proposed plan to stop the Chinese civil war. He advocated revitalizing morality to give the country a new standard of morality. He was quoted as saying: "The only way to completely eradicate the Communist Party is for the National Government to promote reform and win the hearts of the people in the Communist-controlled areas." The United Press reporter said that He was a professional soldier, but now he has come up with this argument, which is really commendable.

In fact, no matter how intrigue there is between countries, no matter how rampant power politics are in the world, everyone knows that the taste of war is not fun, and war cannot solve any dispute. After the First World War, it was followed by the Second World War. The peace conference is still in progress, and there are hidden worries about the Third World War. This shows that war cannot bring true peace!

General He Yingqin advocates revitalizing morality to eliminate the civil war, which is the same as in international wars. Although He has not explained the meaning of the word morality, I believe it must be based on a belief of mutual understanding, mutual respect, and mutual assistance; it is a constructive and evolutionary social force. Only with such a standard can people's hearts not fall, and human desires will not flow and collapse.

In today's world of reason's decline, we may think that raising the word morality is a pedantic theory. However, if there is no moral standard, everyone is planning for their own self-interest, how can our society have a day of purification? Today, our country is full of corrupt officials, corrupt clerks, unscrupulous merchants, bandits, rape, fraud, and other personnel matters, which does not explain that the morality of our society has been lost?

After eight years of the War of Resistance Against Japan, our material destruction has certainly caused heavy losses; but the corruption of our national morality has affected our national construction process, which may be more significant than material losses!

Therefore, rebuilding the power of morality is really the main factor for our national revival. The rise and fall of a nation depends on whether it can have a social morality that is appropriate for the times. Japan was defeated, but the Japanese people can endure hardships and strive to rebuild their country under control. This spirit of "hard work" and "endurance" is their current moral standard.

However, in order to revitalize people's hearts with morality and maintain the people's trust, it is necessary for the generally enlightened people to practice it faithfully and form a habit. Therefore, how the officials and people in the education and cultural circles in China today rectify their work and strive to love themselves is even more important for exerting the power of morality.

### Miscellaneous Records of Watching Football

— Liu Meng

Sing Tao and Han City met at Yiguo, and although a few of us cannot be considered football fans, we went excitedly to watch the game. Expecting the audience to be crowded, we hurriedly ate lunch and set off. But unexpectedly, there was a problem with the tickets; we did not have the strength to "squeeze," so we had to ask the black market for help. "5,000 sold for 6,000." We felt that it was not worth spending a thousand yuan more, and it was not "painful" to take out the money to exchange for the tickets. (The paper is yellow. When we entered the gate, we found that some people were holding tickets with white paper. I don't know why the tickets for the same time were divided into colors).

Squeezing through the park gate, the problem became more and more serious: people! There were people everywhere! Not to mention the stands, even the roofs, trees, and even the football field were full of people. The players came and could not kick off, and even the military police could not maintain order. A military policeman's head was hit by a "stray brick" and was injured.

It was easy to clear a football field, but after a few minutes of kickoff, the ball disappeared. The crowd was pushing and shoving. Seeing that the "situation" was not right, we hurriedly withdrew from Yiyuan together. W often fantasizes, and he was the first to start discussing:

"Servility! The military police's advice is not effective; if the military police's attitude is not gentle, there will be a fight. Who dares to be wild in front of a bayonet? Servility! A hundred points of servility!"

H is the most face-conscious person, and he obviously does not agree with W's opinion, so he asks W in return:

"Are you not Chinese? Is that how you say Chinese people are servile? ——However, this is too embarrassing: watching the ball and running to the field to watch, setting off firecrackers, shouting, disorder, I'm sorry to foreign friends." When he finished speaking in a series, I interjected:

"Selling unlimited tickets, at least selling tickets without prediction, may not be right? Don't just talk about servility and face."

"Where!" W said aggressively: "It is very likely that there is a planned sabotage. You squeeze in with tickets, and you squeeze in without tickets, and you still squeeze into the field to make the game impossible!"

M also opened his mouth:

"You say sabotage, where is the evidence? What is the reason?"

"Sabotage is sabotage, isn't it a very obvious fact? Weren't you at the stadium? Didn't you see it?"

What exactly is going on? Let it be a mystery!

### Angel

— Hua

Man A: What kind of person is your wife?

Man B: Ah, she is an angel, really an angel.

Man A: Well, you are much happier than me. My wife is still alive.

### A Record of Listening to a Symphony Orchestra Performance

— Ni Qiuping

On April 27, the Municipal Government Concert in Lanxin was full before 5 o'clock. Many people left because they did not have tickets, and a few people squeezed to the back.

The opening was Beethoven's Coriolan Overture. At the beginning, there was a heavy tone and a momentary pause. This sound seemed to be flashing, making the entire audience tense. Beethoven's works are always great and fiery.

Next was Resspighi's Suite: This is completely different from the previous overture.

The third program was Mozart's Symphony No. 39. Mozart is the representative of the classical school, and now most new school people say he is too old-fashioned. However, Mozart's works never feel novel the first time you listen to them, and you will not get tired of listening to them dozens of times. This is Mozart's characteristic.

After the break was Elgar's Elegy, a string ensemble. Elgar is a very famous modern British composer, but this tune is very ordinary.

The last two pieces were both by Grainger. The first was an arrangement of an Irish tune, which was played by a string and two French horns. This tune was really very good and very easy to accept. The last piece was also Grainger's work - Shepherd's Call, short and pleasant. Under the constant applause of the audience, it was repeated once, with the same brilliance.

All the team members played well, and the string section performed the best. One or two of the wind instrument players were former Municipal Council members, but they were not very good. But in any case, this achievement is already very remarkable. I hope that the next performance (May 11) will be even more exciting than this one. We are waiting for the training of Professor Arlic, and of course he will not disappoint us. He will definitely make us feel more satisfied each time.

### Morphine

— Ma Jin

On April 12, the Cai E ship of the Reception Bureau arrived in Shanghai from Tianjin. Eight large bags of morphine were seized from the luggage of several female passengers, weighing 77.4 taels, worth about 300 million yuan.

This news greatly shocked my soul, and made me think of the enemy's cruel and thorough drug policy against China. The victory has been coming for almost two years, and Tianjin is still the main den for manufacturing and selling drugs. What else can be said?

In the north, morphine is commonly called white powder. Wherever the enemy cavalry passed, there was white powder. During the occupation, even in the remote mountain villages of Hebei and Shanxi, the operation of tea and smoke shops may have been normal, but the white powder business must not be lacking, because it is in great demand and highly profitable. Therefore, in the vast areas of the Yellow River, no matter how poor or rich the family, no matter how men or women, even children of more than ten years old are addicted to drugs. The intensity of the harm and the depth of the poison can be imagined.

Before the July 7th Incident, the Japanese concession in Tianjin was the main base for the production and sale of drugs. Japanese and Korean ronin were in charge of it. During the war, they used the labor of the military to cover up their activities, and this industry became more rampant. The raw material for white powder is opium. Around 1940, the provinces of Jin, Cha, and Sui received secret orders from the Japanese puppets to plant poppy seedlings on a large scale. I don't know if they have disappeared after the victory?

### Arts and Literature Scene

Chengdu currently has two theaters. The Sullivan Theater is currently performing "Chu Ge," written by Yao Ke. The China Art Theater is performing "Carnival Night." Another report says that the China Victory Theater will soon stage "Fragrant Grass on the Horizon," written by Xia Yan, in a guerrilla-style performance.

Wang Xiyan is still in Fuzhou, editing the "Literary Arts" section of the Fuzhou Times. Recently, he asked friends in Shanghai for submissions. He specifically stated upfront regarding the payment, "It is pitifully low."

The Chengdu Literary Association held a gathering for members on the May Fourth Literary Day and re-elected the board of directors.

### On Reclusion

— Bu Shu

Here is a story mocking a monk:

"Wu Yuanci (Qi) traveled to Guangzhou. There was a monk named Da Shan who waited daily at the doors of the Governor-General, Generals, and various judicial commissioners. One day, he complained to Wu that social engagements were numerous and annoying, making him suffer greatly. Wu smiled and replied, 'Since you suffer so much, why not become a monk?'" ("Notes from Yixiang Ancestor" by Wang Shizhen)

There are several types of monks: One type is the "deserter" from the battlefield of life; another type is, "If monks don't marry, where do young monks come from?" Yet young monks are eventually sent to the temple, from childhood to adulthood, never knowing what "home" is, let alone what "becoming a monk" means; yet another type emerges from lay practitioners, appearing world-weary and cynical, but in reality, they are victims of "refinement"; the last type are those who style themselves as poet-monks, with six senses purified and an arrogant demeanor, yet sometimes deeply desiring to be listed on the candidate official list, sneaking through the back door of powerful officials, "Like a swallow gathering in the clouds, flying to and from the prime minister's yamen."

Yang Chengzhai's poem says: "Before donning the cassock, there are many matters to discuss; after donning the cassock, there are even more matters." I don't know which category the monk Da Shan should be placed in. — "Why not become a monk!" He has "left" once already.

True hermits are not like this.

Zhu Hui'an said: "Hermits are all people with strong personalities and grievances, like Tao Yuanming, who wanted to achieve something but couldn't." This truly speaks to the inner thoughts of true hermits. Qu Yuan, with his strong personality and grievances, couldn't bear to truly seclude himself and eventually drowned in the Miluo River; Cai Yong, who wanted to seclude himself, immediately knelt under the phrase "I can implicate your clan," unable to hide; although Tao Yuanming was relatively detached, he couldn't avoid "Xingtian wielding a thousand axes," and boasting that his "fierce ambition is always present." Someone said:

"Tao Qian in the late Jin Dynasty was similar to Kong Rong in the late Han Dynasty and Ji Kang in the late Wei Dynasty, all close to the time of dynastic change. But he did not express any vehement emotions, thus earning the name of a pastoral poet. However, there is a poem in Tao's collection called 'Describing Wine,' which discusses the politics of the time... From this, it can be seen that Tao Qian could not transcend the mortal world, and he was still concerned about court affairs and could not forget death, which he frequently mentioned in his poems."

Precisely because of this, Tao Qian, though unable to become the "refined person" in the eyes of affected individuals, still retained his warm humanity—a common person. A true hermit should be like this: "Fit for the court, then serve the court; fit for the wilderness, then live in the wilderness." Without hypocrisy, there is no affectation. Unable to benefit the world, one can at least preserve one's own integrity.

Jiao Xun said it well:

"People cannot hide, cannot truly hide, and there is no such thing as hiding. One who has the learning of the Duke of Zhou and Confucius but does not serve can be called a recluse; however, one who has the learning of the Duke of Zhou and Confucius will certainly not hide. People like Xu You, Chao Fu, and Ju Ni claimed to be of isolated nature, knowing that they could not benefit the country or the people, so they hid in the mountains and forests to conceal their talents. Therefore, they have an abundance of poetic expression about the wind and the moon, and an abundance of unconventional behavior to criticize the world and maintain their independence, but they are insufficient to hold the reins of the world... Therefore, tilling the land for food and digging wells for drink is a matter of allocation... Fit for the court, then serve the court; fit for the wilderness, then live in the wilderness. The sage's hiding is to wait for the time to be used. To claim seclusion without the means to be useful is absurd."

This should be a good sobering agent for the likes of Monk Da Shan today.

### Book Famine

— Liu Meng

Reports state: Shanxi is experiencing a severe book famine, and even textbooks from the enemy-puppet period are still in circulation. Victory has been nearly two years, and this situation seems to need to be ended.

Leaving aside Shanxi, where printing conditions lag behind, even in Shanghai, there are many shortcomings in the current printing of elementary school textbooks: misprints, missing strokes, blurriness, and inconsistencies are abundant. These not only harm the eyesight of elementary school students but also increase their chances of writing words incorrectly. In Shanghai, where printing conditions are quite superior, these shortcomings should not exist. I wonder why these shortcomings are still allowed to persist? Has the time for rectifying these shortcomings not yet arrived?

No one would deny the importance of basic education, but if the tools (the most basic tools) directly related to basic education are not done well, what about the rest?

### Record of a City in Crisis

— Qin Shouou

"Old Zhu is giving it his all!" Zhang Chang nodded and wagged his head, saying, "He didn't even come back for lunch today. He must be there again, badgering that transportation director for a solution!"

The people in the room looked at each other with little optimism.

Old Zhu has been earnestly running around for almost a month!—all to borrow one or two trucks. But the number of people remaining in this city in crisis is dwindling day by day, and the more those who remain behind linger, the more ruthless their hearts become. It can be said that whether they are party members, government officials, military personnel, businessmen, scholars, or workers, those who have vehicles in their hands have become influential figures who look down on everyone, the most loyal believers in realism. National interests, relatives, friends—no one cares about anything. Everyone's minds are filled with only themselves, only goods, only cash—cash that can be converted immediately. Checks won't do!

The enemy is about to attack. Who will resist? How will they resist? What will we do if they chase us? Escape to Tibet? Escape to the Himalayas?... From beginning to end, no one in this city has considered it. It's as if the War of Resistance is someone else's business, and they only care about one thing—escaping!

A city in crisis! It's not really a city in crisis, is it? It should be called "City of Fools" to be truly fitting!

After half a day of discussing the problem of vehicles, the group of fools suddenly brought up Xu Shaoming, the general manager of Zhongfu Company, and his famously assertive Shandong wife, who came from a drum-singing background.

"That woman is really something!" Zhang Chang said naively, "With her bold and fierce personality, she actually has a great talent for music. Yesterday, Old Chen and I passed by the Xu's house and heard someone playing the guitar inside, playing it very well. Later, I ran into Mrs. Hu in Dongjiang, who said that she also plays the violin, but unfortunately..."

"Unfortunately, she married Xu Jieming, otherwise you could become friends with her. Right?" someone immediately interjected jokingly.

"Then Xiao Zhang would be out of luck!" Lu Qian couldn't help but break into a smile. "Your ears would probably be torn at least twice a week, and you wouldn't be able to play the harmonica anymore!"

Zhang Chang squinted his eyes and made a face.

"I don't like her at all!" After a pause, he changed his tone and said, "Compared to Mrs. Hu, she is far inferior! Mrs. Hu is not only beautiful and has a gentle personality, but she can also be said to be a standard artist who hasn't deteriorated!" (58)
