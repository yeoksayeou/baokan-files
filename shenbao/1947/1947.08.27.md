### Government Council Discusses Thrift - Implementation Measures Submitted for Review - President Zhang Proposes Establishing a Supervisory Committee

The Executive Yuan held its 18th routine meeting on the morning of the 26th, chaired by President Zhang. The following important proposals were passed: (1) Organizational Regulations for the Administrative Regulations Review Committee; (2) Measures for Holding Weekly or Monthly Meetings in Government Agencies and Schools at All Levels; (3) Designation of the Mongolian-Tibetan Affairs Commission and the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, respectively, as the Central Organizing Agencies for the Election of Supervisory Committee Members by Mongolian, Tibetan, and Overseas Chinese Compatriots; (4) The proposal to allocate 2% of the freight charges of ships traveling on the North-South Seas and the Yangtze River main line to the Two-Guang (Guangdong and Guangxi) Flood Relief Fund was resolved not to be added to the freight charges, so as not to increase the burden on the people; (5) Establishment of a city in Gui Sui (now Hohhot), but without adding quota of National Assembly representatives; (6) Payment for the China Textile Company's supply of military gauze and cloth in the 36th year of the Republic; (7) Emergency measures expenses for the three provinces of Shandong, Shanxi, and Gansu; (8) Food rations for the police in the two cities of Peiping (Beijing) and Tianjin; (9) Special funds for North-South epidemic prevention; (10) Additional funds for the Resources Committee's barter trade to repay debts and purchase and transport minerals; (11) Funding for the repair of revolutionary memorial buildings such as Huanghuagang in Guangdong Province; (12) Additional regular expenses for the Lanzhou Central Hospital for the period from June to December of the 36th year of the Republic; (13) Additional unallocated funds for the Post-War Relief Fund; (14) Dismissal of Pang Songzhou, Political Vice Minister of the Food Department, due to other appointments, and appointment of Duanmu Kai as his successor; (15) Chiang Chung-cheng (Chiang Kai-shek), concurrently President of National Chengchi University, requested to resign from his concurrent post. Considering the avoidance of concurrent positions, Gu Yuxiu was appointed as his successor.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 26th] The Executive Yuan's routine meeting on the morning of the 26th discussed two major thrift proposals: one was to establish a thrift supervision committee, and the other was to limit the number of personnel based on the actual needs of each agency's operations. However, as further study was needed, it was decided to submit them for review again. The implementation measures for various thrift consumption items will be reviewed by a special review committee established by the Executive Yuan, and the above two proposals will also be handled together.

The thrift supervision committee was drafted in accordance with the handwritten instructions of Chairman Chiang. On the 19th, Chairman Chiang instructed Executive Yuan President Zhang Qun to "designate important personnel within the Executive Yuan to focus on overseeing and supervising government thrift matters. It is best to have a simple organization so that it can be responsible for implementation." President Zhang therefore decided to establish a thrift supervision committee and drafted draft organizational regulations for discussion at the meeting.

The content of the draft is as follows: (1) The Executive Yuan will establish a thrift supervision committee to oversee the implementation of the thrift consumption guidelines and related measures; (2) The committee will have one chairman, concurrently held by a member of the Executive Yuan designated by the President of the Executive Yuan, and twelve members. In addition to the Deputy Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan and the five Vice Ministers of the Ministries of Interior, National Defense, Economy, Transportation, and Social Affairs serving as ex officio members, the President of the Executive Yuan will appoint three members each from the Supervisory Committee of the Control Yuan and the members of the National Economic Council; (3) The committee will have one chief secretary, concurrently held by the director of the Sixth Group of the Secretariat of the Executive Yuan. The secretary and staff will be designated by the chief secretary from the personnel of the Sixth Group. When necessary, he may request the President of the Executive Yuan to transfer personnel from the Secretariat of the Executive Yuan, the Secretariat of the National Economic Council, or relevant ministries to assist; (4) The committee will meet once every two weeks, and the chairman will convene extraordinary meetings when necessary; (5) The committee may request reports from central government agencies and provincial and municipal governments on the implementation of thrift guidelines and measures for review; (6) The members of the committee should form groups of two and go to the central government agencies and major cities at any time to inspect the actual implementation of the thrift guidelines and measures. However, when performing inspection tasks, the members should recuse themselves from agencies related to them; (7) If the committee finds that central government agencies and provincial and municipal governments are not effectively implementing the thrift guidelines and measures, it may report to the President of the Executive Yuan for approval after a majority vote.

### Limiting the Number of Personnel in Each Agency - Drafting Two Implementation and Inspection Plans

The limitation of personnel in each agency is based on the "Guidelines for Implementing Thrift Consumption Measures" passed by the State Council. The Executive Yuan formulated implementation measures and inspection methods, and drafted two plans, A and B, and invited the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics and the Ministry of Audit to jointly review and revise them.

Plan A is the "Measures for Each Agency to Implement Personnel Limitation and Review Based on Actual Operational Needs": (1) The number of personnel in government agencies and public enterprises should be based on the approved budget quota for the 36th year of the Republic, and no additional personnel may be added thereafter; (2) The inspection of personnel limitation should be strictly controlled in accordance with the procedures for budget and final accounts.

Plan B is the "Measures for Each Agency to Implement Institution Reduction, Personnel Limitation, and Inspection Based on Actual Operational Needs": (1) Each ministry, commission, provincial, municipal, and county government, and its affiliated agencies should retain only the essential institutions based on current actual needs. Those that are not currently essential or cannot be implemented at present should be abolished or merged (internal plans have been drafted for the reduction of provincial and county government institutions, which can be adopted). Each agency that handles temporary affairs does not need to set up a separate institution. The personnel required should be transferred as a principle; (2) State-owned enterprises without operating expenses or regular business should be abolished immediately; (3) The number of personnel established by each ministry, commission, provincial, municipal, and county government, and its affiliated agencies should be based on the complexity of the affairs handled, in order to determine the number of personnel to be established. If the original organization is large or the number of personnel exceeds the standard, efforts should be made to reduce or merge them separately; (4) The standards for the number of personnel to be established are as follows: A. General administrative agencies should take the receipt and dispatch of documents as the standard, and uniformly stipulate the number of documents (including incoming and outgoing documents) that each person should handle each month. The number of personnel should be determined after liquidating the total number of documents received and dispatched by the agency from January to the end of June of this year. B. Executive agencies should take the handling of affairs as the standard to determine the number of personnel. C. Research agencies should take the research matters as the standard to determine the number of personnel. D. Production agencies should take the personnel required by local private enterprises as the standard to determine the number of personnel. The detailed standards for each item in the preceding paragraph should be drafted separately by each ministry, commission, provincial, municipal, and county government under the Executive Yuan based on the nature of the agencies under their jurisdiction, and then uniformly stipulated after approval by the Executive Yuan (internal units of each agency should also adjust themselves automatically according to this standard, so as to avoid the drawbacks of uneven distribution of workload and unequal labor and leisure). State-owned enterprises should draft more flexible organizational regulations and complete the legislative procedures. The personnel should be sent to the Ministry of Personnel for qualification in accordance with the personnel regulations; (5) The total number of personnel handling affairs in each agency (documents, cashier, general affairs, accounting, and personnel of the agency) shall not exceed 30% of the personnel handling business; (6) The procedure for retaining existing personnel after each agency determines the number of personnel to be listed is as follows: A. Persons who have passed the examination according to law; B. Persons who are qualified for qualification; C. Professional personnel with special skills. If there is a surplus after the allocation of the number of places in the first three items, an examination should be held within the remaining quota, and the order of merit and reference service seniority should be used to retain them; (7) The handling of the determination of personnel reduction shall be in accordance with the following procedures: A. Assist in job transfer; B. Provide severance pay; C. If the government needs to establish new institutions due to factual needs, its personnel should be given priority to be appointed by the aforementioned dismissed personnel. Those who are assisted in job transfer and introduced to a job by a political affairs agency will not be given severance pay. If they seek their own livelihood or run a business, the original service agency may still be given severance pay if it provides assistance; (8) If each agency has special difficulties in reducing personnel according to these measures, it may apply to the Executive Yuan for drafting, and the sufficient personnel outside the standard personnel to be established should not be reduced temporarily. However, if the original personnel leave their positions (including voluntary resignation and dismissal due to reasons, etc.), they shall not be replaced again, in order to gradually reach the standard number of people. The number of excess personnel leaving their positions in the preceding paragraph shall be reported to the superior agency on a monthly basis and reported to the Executive Yuan for verification and budget reduction; (9) The expenses for layoffs shall be approved for payment from the expenses already included in the annual budget of each agency, and no additional expenses shall be added; (10) After each agency determines the number of personnel in accordance with the preceding articles, the expenses shall be based on the number of personnel, and shall be strictly controlled by the procedures of budget and final accounts. If there are any changes thereafter, the above standards shall be adjusted again when preparing the annual budget each year, and no additions shall be allowed at ordinary times; (11) Inspection matters shall be handled by the accounting agency and the auditing agency in accordance with the law.

Mongolian-Tibetan and Overseas Areas - Election of Supervisory Committee Members - Organized by the Mongolian-Tibetan and Overseas Chinese Affairs Commissions

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 26th] The election of Supervisory Committee members by the participating councils of each province and city was previously decided by the Executive Yuan to be managed internally by the central government. For those Mongolian-Tibetan and overseas areas where no participating councils have been established, the internal affairs departments and the Mongolian-Tibetan and Overseas Chinese Affairs Commissions consulted on which agency should be responsible for organizing the election of Supervisory Committee members. The result was that it should be organized by the two commissions. This proposal was submitted to the Executive Yuan meeting on the 26th and passed.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 26th] According to the Military News Agency, the deadline for registration for the Youth League members' election is set for the 10th of next month.

Those who participate in the election of National Assembly representatives should be registered by the district League headquarters to the local party headquarters.

### Thirty-Seventh Year - Policy Guidelines - Content Divided into Five Major Sectors

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 26th] The policy guidelines for the 37th year have been drafted by President Zhang, and the content is divided into five major sectors: (1) General Outline, (2) Politics, (3) Finance and Economy, (4) Construction Undertakings, and (5) Military Affairs. Items 3 and 4 are exactly the same as the economic reform plan.

### Administrative Regulations Review Committee - Organizational Regulations Passed - Lei Zhen Internally Appointed as Chairman

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 26th] In accordance with the Constitution, the Executive Yuan decided to determine the central and local powers and to organize the current administrative regulations. It was decided to establish an Administrative Regulations Review Committee, and Lei Zhen, a member of the Political Affairs Committee, was internally appointed as the chairman. The organizational regulations of the committee were passed by the Executive Yuan meeting on the 26th. Its task is to review and organize the provisions of the current administrative regulations relating to the central and local powers that conflict with the Constitution. The committee will have 17 to 25 members, composed of Political Affairs Committee members, Deputy Secretary-General, Chairman of the Executive Yuan Legal Affairs Committee, and representatives of various ministries and commissions. It is tentatively scheduled to meet once a week.

### Measures for Allocating Quotas for Occupational Groups - Gu Zhenggang Explains Three Points - Those with Limited Total Quota Should be Allocated by Region or Elected Jointly Nationwide

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 26th] Minister Gu Zhenggang recently made the following remarks on the allocation of quota for occupational groups for elections: The detailed allocation measures for the election quota of occupational groups for National Assembly representatives and legislators should have been issued by the Ministry earlier. However, the originally allocated quota for industrial and commercial groups was too small. The groups successively appealed through documents and telegrams, and the National Government ordered the Legislative Yuan to review and discuss it. The Ministry also approved the letter from the National Government's Civil Affairs Office, transferring the President's instruction to directly consult with the Legislative Yuan. The matter has not yet been resolved. However, the National Assembly election procedure has been started for a long time. The detailed allocation measures cannot be delayed any further. The industrial and commercial groups' quota will not be allocated temporarily. The other detailed allocation measures will be formulated and announced separately after the quota for these groups is revised. The most important points to be explained are the following three points: (1) The quota for the number of members of various occupational groups to be elected in the two elections and the allocation of the number of women among them are determined by the Legislative Yuan in the original table. The Ministry can only consider and divide within the established quota. (2) The total quota for various occupational groups is limited. Except for the National Assembly's agricultural and labor groups, which can be subdivided by province and city, other parts can be divided into several regions nationwide, and another part of special industries can be allocated as much as possible according to the industry. The smallest number is determined to be elected jointly nationwide to avoid unevenness. (3) Except that there are more women among the employees of the Education Association, the quota for women can be allocated by region for National Assembly representatives. Other quotas will be calculated by comprehensive national votes to avoid vacancies in each county.

### Military and Political Supervisory Group of Peiping-Tianjin-Hebei - Begins Investigation of Denunciation Cases - Li Sicong Explains Determination to Rectify Military Discipline and Officialdom

[Our Newspaper, Peiping, 26th] The Military and Political Supervisory Group of Peiping-Tianjin-Hebei hosted reporters at 5:00 p.m. on the 26th. The head of the group, Li Sicong, explained that the group has the determination to thoroughly rectify military discipline and officialdom without fear of powerful figures. He hoped that all military and political leaders would carefully consider President Chiang's love for the North and specially order the formation of this group to first rectify their subordinates. Since the group accepted denunciations, it has received more than 70 letters of denunciation. The members of the group have begun investigating them separately yesterday, and will soon go to inspect the Pinghan, Jinpu, and Beining railway lines and accept denunciations. Shi Zizhou, the Speaker of the Tianjin Temporary Council, will be stationed in Tianjin.

### After Suspension of Memorial Week - Changed to Weekly or Monthly Meetings

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 26th] After the Memorial Week is suspended, in order to communicate emotions, concentrate will, improve work efficiency, and advocate good habits in government agencies and schools, the Executive Yuan decided to change it to weekly or monthly meetings. The heads of agencies and schools will give spiritual speeches, or designate senior personnel to report on business, or give special lectures. The meeting procedures will be carried out in the manner of ordinary gatherings. The Executive Yuan passed these measures on the 26th.

### Foreign Exchange Application Cases

Still Limited to Three Major Sectors

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 26th] Regarding the handling of foreign exchange application cases, they are currently divided into three major sectors: (1) Applications from government agencies are reviewed by the Executive Yuan Foreign Exchange Review Committee; (2) Applications from self-funded students studying abroad are handled by the Central Bank and reported to the Foreign Exchange Review Committee for record; (3) Import and export foreign exchange cases are still handled by the Export and Import Management Committee. However, there are currently no clear regulations on where private individuals traveling abroad for sightseeing or recuperation and foreign exchange cases that are not import and export in nature (such as living expenses for reporters sent overseas by newspapers) should apply. The Foreign Exchange Review Committee believes that there are too many cases of this type, the procedures are cumbersome, and there are not enough personnel. Moreover, it is difficult for the government to fully implement the management of foreign exchange. After deliberation by the committee, it was decided that the foreign exchange cases under the jurisdiction of the committee should still be limited to the aforementioned three parts, and the Executive Yuan approved it at the meeting on the 26th.

### Vice President Sun in Guangzhou

Received Reporters Yesterday and Will Return to the Capital on the 30th

[Our Newspaper, Guangzhou, 26th] When Vice President Sun received reporters at the official residence of the Xing Yuan at 9:30 a.m. on the 26th, he replied to various inquiries: (1) The visit of Envoy Wei to China is to inspect how to help China. Other speculations are really overly concerned. At present, the threat to China is the Soviet Union, not the United States. The problem of Lushun and Dalian can prove it. The Vice President continued in a generous tone to point out those who are new imperialists. The current national crisis is actually more serious than the "September 18th" Incident. We should be especially vigilant. (2) The central government destroys peace, destroys transportation and industry, and makes people unable to live. It is really abandoned by the people of the country. To stop the civil strife, unless the Chinese Communist Party can change its mind and abandon the war, but he believes that the Communist rebellion can be quelled, unless we do not work hard. (3) The issue of recovering Hong Kong cannot be discussed at present. (4) The election will be held as scheduled, saying that there is no legal basis for postponement. (5) He himself has not yet considered running for legislator. It is also known that Vice President Sun is scheduled to return to the capital on the 30th.

### Foreign Ministry Sends Note to the United States - Protesting the Release of Pearson

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 26th] According to reliable information: Our Foreign Ministry sent a note to the US Embassy in China on the 26th to convey to the US Department of State, protesting that US soldier Pearson, the perpetrator of the Dongdan incident in Peiping, was found not guilty by the US Department of Defense and was reinstated. It requested the US Department of State to forward to the Department of Defense to re-examine the matter based on the trial records, handle it impartially, and promptly fulfill the civil compensation part after the criminal part is determined.

### Third Batch of Assigned Japanese Warships - Can Arrive at Jiaozhou Bay Today

[Our Newspaper, Qingdao, 26th] The third batch of assigned Japanese warships, which is also the last batch, is being escorted to Qingdao by Major Zhong of our navy, escorted by the Japanese ship Ishi. The Second Base Command sent ships to sea to guide the port on the evening of the 26th, and it can sail into Jiaozhou Bay on the morning of the 27th. The largest of the batch of Japanese warships - the Zhong Yi Liang Yue destroyer - is 3,485 tons, followed by a 1,500-ton transport ship and six destroyers.

### Authoritative Sources in Washington Analyze Wei's Message, Hoping for Immediate Reforms and Assistance

[United Press Washington, 25th] A well-informed source (closely connected with Special Envoy Wei) stated on the 25th: "The publication of General Wedemeyer's farewell statement undoubtedly aims to compel the Chinese government to implement certain reforms, providing a basis for the United States to increase aid to the central government. The severe tone of the message does not indicate that Wei will recommend suspending aid to the central government after returning to Washington in mid-September." The source stated: The timing of Wei's statement indicates that it is intended to leverage official opinion and public sentiment in China to force the Chinese government to implement certain reforms when President Truman and General Marshall consider providing aid to China based on Wei's findings. Otherwise, this statement would have been released after Wei's return home. Wei stated: If the CCP is "truly patriotic," it should stop the war and assist the country through "peaceful means." The general opinion here is that the CCP will never do so, and therefore they cannot escape Wei's condemnation.

On the other hand, Wei's criticism of the National Government officials' incompetence and corruption may be mitigated by evidence of reform.

Observers generally believe that Wei has left the Chinese government a way out, allowing it to revitalize itself and qualify for American aid. However, the CCP clearly cannot accept Wei's suggestions.

Although Wei severely criticized various departments of the Chinese government, he made an exception for President Chiang Kai-shek, similar to Marshall's statement last spring.

This fact, coupled with Wei's statement that government reforms should be implemented immediately, leads diplomatic observers here to expect the Chinese government to announce a "reorganization" in the near future.

[United States Information Service, Washington, 25th] The New York Times commented on General Wedemeyer's statement today: "General Wei's words are extremely clear and can be heard even in the most remote provinces of China. This statement is, in effect, a gentle 'ultimatum' to the National Government, stating that the National Government cannot obtain American aid until it has completed a rigorous and honest overhaul of itself."

### Minshe Party's Feng Jinbai to Visit Europe and America for Study

[This newspaper Nanjing, 26th] Feng Jinbai, a key member of the Minshe Party, will travel to Europe and America in the short term to study the current political situations in various countries and research the factors contributing to their political enlightenment and social order. According to Feng, his motivation for this study stems from the current chaotic political situation in China, and he hopes to learn from his research. His study will focus particularly on the development of small European countries such as Switzerland, as the United States, with its advanced electrification, is not comparable. Feng's study will last for about a year, and he will travel in his personal capacity. He arrived in Nanjing from Guling on the 26th and will proceed to Shanghai after completing the departure procedures.

### Wei Arrives in Seoul from Japan, Issues Statement Clarifying Purpose of Trip, Report to be Drafted in Hawaii

[United Press Tokyo, 26th] Lieutenant General Wedemeyer left Haneda Airport here at 9:30 a.m. on the 26th for Korea. When asked about whether the Wedemeyer mission would visit the Soviet military zone in North Korea, a spokesman for Wedemeyer expressed doubt, but said it was not certain, as Wei had not yet been informed of any plans agreed upon by the US military in Korea.

[United News Agency, Seoul, 26th] Special Envoy Wedemeyer and his party arrived here at 2:25 p.m. on the 26th and immediately issued a statement stating that the fact-finding mission is scheduled for one week and will not hold press conferences. The mission personnel will work completely objectively and without prejudice. All reports obtained will be submitted to the US government, which will then decide how to assist the Korean people, improve their welfare, and safeguard their hard-won peace.

[United News Agency, Nanjing, 26th] Well-informed sources said: After visiting Korea, Special Envoy Wedemeyer will fly to Japan and then to Hawaii, where he can "concentrate on drafting the report without external influence" and submit it to President Truman. There are two reasons for Wei's choice of Hawaii to prepare the report: the climate in Hawaii is mild, completely different from the humid heat of Nanjing, and its location is ideal for a good working environment.

Foreign Minister Wang Reports on Wei's Departure Statement at the Political Affairs Meeting

[This newspaper Nanjing, 26th] At the Political Affairs Meeting on the 26th, Foreign Minister Wang Shijie reported on General Wedemeyer's visit to China, stating briefly: The Chinese side provided as much assistance as possible to Special Envoy Wei during his month-long stay in China to facilitate his work. His farewell statement was indeed very frank and straightforward, and his starting point was genuine friendship. Unfortunately, his stay in China was too short, and the situation in China and the Far East has changed greatly in the past six months. It seems that Wei still needs to further understand some issues. Subsequently, various political committee members spoke, with some believing that Wei's criticism of some government officials for corruption and incompetence was too general and vague. Some believed that China's difficulties were no longer purely internal affairs. The conclusion in Wei's statement that everything should be resolved by China on its own seemed unfair. Some believed that, judging from Wei's statement, some of his judgments were no different from those made by previous senior American officials who visited China, which may be due to the influence of certain preconceived notions. Some believed that Wei's continued expectation that the communists would abandon armed struggle and consider the interests of the people was a naive argument. However, all unanimously acknowledged Wei as a sincere friend of China and looked forward to working together. After a heated discussion, all political committee members expressed their willingness to work hard, be diligent and strive for progress, and overcome the difficulties together.

[This newspaper Xuzhou, 26th] The National Army in southern Henan has won a major victory. The remnants of Liu's 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 7th Columns attacked Runanpu again on the morning of the 24th.

The National Army continued to cross the Ru River and pursue them, annihilating more than 5,000 bandits and seizing more than 70 vehicles, 400 horses, more than 200 light and heavy machine guns, and more than 100 rifles. On the afternoon of the 25th, the National Army patrolled as far as Baoxinji, north of Xixian County. Also, Liu's 6th Column attacked Gushi on the 24th. The National Army has crossed the Huai River and is tracking them down. When Liu's bandits entered eastern Henan, they numbered about 40,000, but now they are less than 25,000. The military stated that the remnants of Liu's bandits may be completely eliminated within two weeks.

[This newspaper Bengbu, 26th] Gushi in southern Henan was captured by communist bandits on the 25th. More than 10,000 bandits on that line attempted to flee to Shangcheng. The main force of Liu Bocheng's troops crossed the Huai River, and there was fighting outside the city of Huangchuan. The 172nd Columns, which besieged Zhengyang on the morning of the 25th, were fiercely attacked by the National Army inside and outside the city, suffering nearly 10,000 casualties and abandoning many supplies and ammunition. This battle was the largest annihilation battle in southern Henan, and the National Army is continuing to search for remnant bandits.

[Central News Agency Zhengzhou, 26th] The entire 6th Column of the communist bandit Liu Bocheng's troops has been wiped out in the Runanpu area. Although other columns still have localized fleeing actions, they have also formed an unorganized state of collapse. Most personnel have changed into civilian clothes, abandoning or selling their weapons, and are preparing to go into hiding. Many are preparing to surrender to the National Army.

[Central News Agency Xuzhou, 26th] The National Army has recently crossed the highway running between Liu'an and Guangshan on the border of Henan and Anhui, intercepting the 6th Column of Liu Bocheng's communist bandits, who had secretly crossed the Huai River from Sanhejian and could advance into Gushi. This is the beginning of the contact between the southern National Army and the fleeing Liu bandits. The National Army has approached Gushi on the 26th and is launching a strong offensive.

[Central News Agency Luoyang, 26th] The total number of bandits who crossed the river from Xin'an and Shanzhou in western Henan is more than 40,000. They have been causing disturbances in several groups for the past three days. On the 26th, a group of about 10,000 attacked Luoyang but are currently being blocked in the Hengyong Matun area. The group that attacked Xin'an after occupying the county seat is showing signs of continuing south. The bandits disturbing Shanzhou are attempting to flee to Lushi and Luoning.

[Central News Agency Kaifeng, 25th] More than 1,000 local bandits in northern Henan, led by Li Jingyi, infiltrated and captured the county towns of Yangwu and Yuanwu in response to the communist bandits crossing the river in western Henan.

[This newspaper Taiyuan, 26th] The National Army in Linfen captured Shicun, an important town on the Tongpu Railway, on the 20th. There is also talk of the recovery of Fencheng County.

A Major Battle in Jiaodong is About to Begin, National Army Approaches Laizhou Bay

[This newspaper Yanzhou, 26th] A major decisive battle that will truly determine the overall situation in Shandong, and the last battle on the Shandong battlefield, is rapidly brewing in Jiaodong. Regarding the scale of this battle, a qualified military observer told this reporter in an optimistic tone: The plains of the northern Shandong battlefield are impossible for the communist bandits to defend for long. Therefore, the Jiaodong battle should be the final showdown on the Shandong battlefield. After the Shandong battles are over, most of the battles within the customs will be resolved, and the Jinpu and Pinghan railways can be completely opened in the shortest possible time. To this end, future war developments will clearly focus on Shanxi as the military center for suppressing bandits.

[This newspaper Qingdao, 26th] The National Army in Changyi advanced north in the autumn rain yesterday and today, and has approached Hutouya (25 li northwest of Pixian) on the east coast of Laizhou Bay, which is also one of the bandits' ports. It is widely believed that the National Army is deploying a large-scale offensive, hoping to completely clear the entire Shandong Peninsula in one fell swoop. In fact, the navy has been constantly patrolling the Bohai Sea, and its duties are similar to blockading various ports.

[Another dispatch] The highway between Jinan and Weixian is clear, and passenger and freight transport can be restored tomorrow or the day after tomorrow. The passenger fare is 80,000 yuan.

[This newspaper Jinan, 26th] The Wenhe River Bridge on the Yanji section of the highway has been completed, and the road officially resumed traffic on the 26th. A delegation from the Jinan press to Zibo found the highway between Jinan and Zibo too muddy to travel and had to turn back before reaching Wangsherenzhuang.

[Central News Agency Xuzhou, 26th] The National Army north of the Jiaoji Railway recovered Qidong before dawn on the 25th. All counties on both sides of the Xiaoqing River have since been brought under the control of the National Army. Also, the remaining communist bandits in western Shandong, under the strict encirclement and suppression of the National Army, once occupied Shanxian County. The National Army counterattacked on the afternoon of the 25th and recovered Shanxian County.

### Northern Jiangsu Recovers Ganyu City, Wang Maogong Talks About Intensifying Zonal Encirclement and Suppression Work

[This newspaper Xinpu, 26th] Ganyu County and Qingkou Town, which had been occupied by communist bandits again, were successively recovered by the National Army on the 26th.

[This newspaper report] Wang Maogong, Chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, recently stated: The Provincial Government's greatest efforts over the past two years have been to eliminate the bandit army in northern Jiangsu and maintain local security, but frequent large-scale troop movements have prevented the pacification work from being completed. The communist bandits in northern Jiangsu are elusive and difficult to eliminate, and the coastal areas are constantly receiving supplies. After the military situation in northern Jiangsu became tense, it was decided to strengthen zonal encirclement and suppression to achieve complete success. In addition, the military situation in the three neighboring provinces of Shandong, Henan, and Anhui is closely related to northern Jiangsu. This time, Liu Bocheng's remnants lost all their heavy weapons and supplies in Shandong and fled to southern Henan. The National Army is making every effort to pursue and annihilate them. Otherwise, if a bandit base is established in the Dabie Mountains, there will be no peace in northern Jiangsu.

[This newspaper Nantong, 26th] Since the National Army recovered Yancheng, order has been restored, and the county magistrate, Liu Xianpei, will return to his post in Shanxi Province to report. It is said that the appointment of Lu Yingzhi, sent by the province as acting county magistrate, will be revoked.

### National Army in Suiyuan Recovers Baisoumiao

[This newspaper Guihua, 25th] The National Army recovered Baisoumiao in Sizihwang Banner at dawn on the 25th. Seven hundred Mongolian bandits were surrounded by vehicles in their sleep. Two-thirds escaped, and the rest were annihilated. The National Army captured 50 war horses and 15 machine guns.

### The Entire Administrative System of Shaanxi Province is Fully Restored

[This newspaper Xi'an, 26th] The Shaanxi Provincial Security Command announced today: The sixteen counties in the area formerly occupied by communist bandits in northern Shaanxi were all recovered by the 19th of this month. Currently, except for the county magistrates of Mizhi, Fu County, and Anding, who have not yet been appointed, the other thirteen county magistrates are all working in their respective county government seats. The administrative system of this province has been fully restored.

### Bumper Autumn Harvest in Sichuan Province, Rice Prices Drop Universally, Provincial Assembly Holds Extraordinary Meeting to Discuss Quotas for Grain Collection

[This newspaper Chengdu, 26th] New grain from Sichuan has entered the market, and rice prices have dropped universally in various places. According to provincial assembly members who have just come to Rong from various counties, this year's harvest in Sichuan, except for the flood-affected areas in western Sichuan, is generally a bumper one. According to statistics, the total autumn harvest in the entire province is even greater than in previous years, which is the best phenomenon since the disaster in Sichuan. There will be no problem with grain collection this year.

[This newspaper Chengdu, 26th] Grain collection in Sichuan this year has already begun. To discuss increasing the quota, the Provincial Assembly convened an extraordinary meeting on the 25th. Chairman Deng, Chairman Huang, and Speaker Xiang all emphasized the importance of suppressing rebellion and building the country, hoping that the people of Sichuan would share the difficulties, support the central government, and complete the glorious mission. The conference will last for four days, and the main topics will be grain collection, disaster relief, and construction.

### Released Nazi Germans in Ping Arrested in Shanghai, Important Figures Suddenly Flee and Hide

[United Press Peiping, 26th] Of the twelve Nazis and their families awaiting repatriation, only three Nazis and four family members were transported to Shanghai by special plane today. Three other Nazis, including two elderly women, submitted certificates from Chinese medicine practitioners claiming that they were currently unable to travel. Six other Nazis, who are currently employed in Chinese agencies, did not travel either. Also, the most important Nazi figure, Xu Erzhang, the former Gestapo leader of northern China, suddenly fled and disappeared before departure.

### Aduorui, the Main Culprit in the Zhonghe Bridge Tragedy, Will Not Be Sent to the United States for the Time Being

Will Testify During Savani's Trial

[Central News Agency Nanjing, 26th] Aduorui, the main culprit in the accident caused by US troops at Zhonghe Bridge, has been tried and convicted by the US military court. The criminal has now been transferred from Beijing to Shanghai for detention by the US military. According to the US military authorities here, Aduorui will still be transferred to Beijing to testify during the trial of another suspect, Sergeant Savani. The rumor that he will be sent to the United States to serve his sentence is slightly different from the facts. His transfer to Shanghai is only for the convenience of detention. The date of his departure to the United States will be after the completion of Savani's trial and the announcement of the judgments of the two. The spokesman also said that the date of Savani's trial has not yet been set.

### Hong Kong Labor Unrest May Expand, Public Utilities Will Be Involved, Electricity, Tram, and Bus Services Are All Brewing Strikes

[Reuters Hong Kong, 26th] Continuing the week-long strike of 10,000 mechanics, there is a possibility of expansion to public utilities. Employees of the electricity company and tram company will meet tonight to discuss demanding an increase of two yuan per person per day in wages, and a resolution to strike if the management does not accept. At the same time, the Chinese Mechanics Union has put forward suggestions for resolving the mechanics' labor unrest. The details will be discussed by the Hong Kong government's labor bureau this morning. Confusion occurred when the Mechanics Union and the Strike Committee met last night. When the Mechanics Union personnel were reporting to the Strike Committee, some workers suddenly broke into the meeting room, accusing some members of the Mechanics Union of not reporting certain important details when negotiating with the Labor Bureau to the Strike Committee. They shouted slogans about the labor unrest negotiations and opposed the negotiations. The Mechanics Union personnel believe that this is a sign that outside elements are trying to undermine the negotiations.

[Central News Agency Hong Kong, 26th] Hong Kong bus drivers are also brewing a strike. If an agreement cannot be reached at the fourth negotiation between labor and management representatives on the afternoon of the 27th, the drivers may go on strike. Negotiations between labor and management of buses have been going on for several days, and the conditions are quite close, but the two sides are insisting on the issue of holidays.

### First Letter Behind the "Iron Curtain": Entering the Red Polish Capital to Mourn the Ruins of Warsaw

— Special Correspondent for This Newspaper, Mao Shuqing

The Vistula River meanders northward, from the Carpathian Mountains all the way to the Baltic Sea, quietly, its dull gray waters creating the Polish Great Plain, and also creating the beautiful city of Warsaw. According to the Poles themselves: their ancestors lived here for generations, this is their original "old home." Formal Polish historical records begin around the year 1000 AD. For more than 900 years, the history of Poland has been woven with blood and tears. Even today, when Poles talk about "the general trend of the world," they feel a hidden pain in their hearts.

I entered Warsaw from Berlin on a British Air Force plane. Beforehand, I certainly felt an unusual anxiety. To be honest, it wasn't because Warsaw was behind the "Iron Curtain" that I worried about any danger to my life, but rather because I knew so little about the situation in Poland. In my country, there were very few books in bookstores specifically about Poland (it seems that Independent Publishing House had a "History of the Restoration of Poland"), and even fewer commentaries or introductions to the modern situation in Poland. In 1939, when Hitler marched into Warsaw, Poland was divided under the champagne glasses of Molotov and Ribbentrop. A newspaper in China wrote a rather "shocking" commentary adding insult to injury. I plan to mention this case in detail in my next dispatch, but in any case, Poland's situation is tragic, and in the eyes of the Chinese people, Poland is not as "hateful" as that commentary's author saw it.

Poland Can Be Compared to Korea

The impressions of the few days I stayed in Warsaw reminded me of a novel by a young Chinese writer, "Sketches of Arctic Scenery," which tells the "sad history" of a Korean youth and a Polish girl. Comparing Poland in the West to Korea in the Far East, I believe this author has a unique inspiration. Three days before leaving Berlin, I met Miss Cowan, a female reporter for The Christian Science Monitor, at the press club. She was also preparing to fly to Warsaw at that time. We chatted about some irrelevant things. Finally, she said very seriously: "It's good to go and see, see a nation that is always conquered by others, their latent inner sorrow!"

She took an American plane and entered Warsaw a day before me. Because I was in a hurry and my miscellaneous affairs in Berlin were not finished, I temporarily asked the Royal Air Force to help me. The Royal Air Force has two special flights a week from London to Poland, passing through Berlin (the American plane has one passenger plane a week). With the special efforts of Major Jones, my name was temporarily inserted. Early in the morning, just as dawn broke, Mr. Xu Xichong, a Chinese resident in Berlin, and Mr. Liu Jingwei, a Chinese leader from Vienna, drove their own car to the "Gatow" airfield to send me off. In a short journey of two hours and five minutes, I flew over the heavily guarded "Iron Curtain" and entered the red Polish capital, Warsaw.

Language Barrier, the Power of English "Dies"

The first difficulty encountered upon arriving in Warsaw was the "language barrier." A Polish Foreign Ministry official on the same trip had just returned from London. Many people at the airport were welcoming him, and they were all saying "Dzień dobry" (Good morning). Dealing with many people who were helping him carry his luggage, they were all saying "Do widzenia" (Goodbye). The Royal Air Force dropped me off at the Warsaw airfield, and their responsibility was considered complete. In order to find a "streetcar" to get into the city, I was sweating profusely because of the language barrier. In the end, the Foreign Ministry official helped and I "bummed" a ride on his luggage cart.

Sitting side by side in the luggage cart was a Foreign Ministry orderly. He offered me a Polish cigarette. No matter how I tried to gesture, he could not understand a single word of my English. The "Iron Curtain" of Europe is not only a division in politics and diplomacy, but also a division in "language." Once you step behind the Iron Curtain, the power of English comes to an end. In the luggage cart, I looked up at the sky, and I felt an indescribable fear in my heart, fearing that my mission to Poland would completely fail.

The airfield is located in the southwest corner of Warsaw. The field is filled with more than twenty passenger and transport planes of "Polish National Airlines", all with brand-new silver background and black letter markings. There are many American and British tourists at the station, and there are many advertisements for Swedish Airlines and Czech Airlines, attracting tourists to visit Stockholm and Prague. I noticed that there were no advertisements on the wall attracting tourists to visit Moscow. Presumably, the Russians don't like that kind of thing!

Heart-Stirring, Not a Single Complete House

The shocking impression Warsaw gave me was: rubble everywhere, the traces of war completely present. In 1945, I traveled in post-war Europe. I saw the ruins of Berlin and the devastation of Hamburg, which left me with an indelible impression. This time I came to Poland, two years later, and I still felt that the tragic situation in Warsaw was shocking. The Poles themselves say: There is not a single 100% complete house in the city of Warsaw. Like a pockmarked face, there are bullet holes everywhere, half of the houses are bombed, there are steel-concrete "dangerous walls," and even in the so-called "Jewish quarter," where the artillery fire was the fiercest, there is a wasteland where even the outlines of the dangerous walls cannot be found. I often like to ask the Warsaw people who can speak English: "In your opinion, how many years will it take for Warsaw to return to its pre-war glory?" They always shrug their shoulders and stretch out their hands: "Ten years, twenty years, maybe thirty years!"

No Pole does not rave about their pre-war Warsaw: asphalt roads with green shade on both sides, orderly rectangular buildings, red roofs, from the small windows of the roofs, you can see the bell towers of the churches, you can see the dark blue water of the Vistula River (Note: The Poles themselves call it the Wisła River). In summer, the water is shallow, and sand beaches rise on the Vistula River. Many young men and women swim in the shallow water of the Vistula River. They sing, exercise, and even get drunk.

Nazi Destruction by Any Means, Destroying Little Paris

In 1939, they will never forget that tragic year. The gunfire broke up their peaceful lives, young people wandered far away, and the elderly groaned under the iron hooves, barely surviving for five years. But at that time, Warsaw was still intact, with less than 20% destroyed.

The disaster in Warsaw occurred in 1944. In early summer, the Russian army liberated Lublin and rushed to the suburbs of Warsaw like a broken bamboo. At that time, the Polish National Committee in Moscow reorganized into the Polish government of Lublin. The orthodox Polish government, which had originally been in exile in London, in order to cooperate with the combat forces, mobilized all the Warsaw underground workers and launched an anti-Nazi "revolutionary movement." The revolution in the city was originally expected to cooperate with the offensive of the Russian army. However, there was no understanding between London and Moscow in advance. When the "Capital Revolution" led by the London exiled government broke out, the Russian army and the Polish army under the leadership of Russia stood still, and even retreated several hundred meters. This aroused the deep hatred of the German army. Those Nazi lads set fires, poured oil, and planted landmines, destroying the city of Warsaw by any means. August and September 1944 were the dark days that Warsaw will never be able to erase. The distant artillery fire of the Russian soldiers, the street fighting between the underground forces and the Nazi army, destroyed Warsaw and destroyed this beautiful city once known as "Little Paris".

City Appearance One-Third Like Chongqing

The Russian army formally entered the city of Warsaw in February 1945. Many overseas Chinese also saw: during the period when the underground forces were fighting alone, British planes dropped supplies over Warsaw. Intermittent street fighting lasted for more than a month. Magnificent buildings were penetrated by artillery shells, and the majestic bridges over the Vistula River were all blown up.

Now, one of the four bridges has been repaired. Wandering on the bridge makes me think of the bridge in Prague, Czech Republic. The cities of Eastern Europe have something in common with each other, and they all have a unique feature that makes people think deeply. Now, times have changed, Eastern Europe is covered with "curtains," and the boudoir is deeply locked. Of course, there are many different feelings!

Another image Warsaw gave me is that it is one-third like Chongqing. Broken walls and ruins are everywhere. However, many simple houses without chess pieces have been leisurely built on both sides of the road, which reminds me of the Chongqing commercial area and Shangqingsi. Small square wooden houses in streets and alleys are everywhere in Warsaw. They are cigarette stands and newsstands. The high-altitude slogans that cross the road, the soldiers in grassy green and dirty uniforms in groups of three or five on the road, are all like Chongqing during the most difficult period of the war. In particular, the long-distance buses in the suburbs of Warsaw, without tops and canopies, and trucks with wooden railings nailed around them, require passengers to get a number first, and wait for the roll call to get on the "one-stop" bus, which is exactly the same as the scenery of Qixinggang in Chongqing.

The Degree of Housing Shortage is the World's Worst, Regulations Require Two People to Live in One Room

The difficulty of transportation is not the only problem. The most problematic thing in Warsaw is housing. "Housing shortage" is a problem everywhere in the world, but I am afraid that none is as severe as in Warsaw. The war destroyed more than half of the houses in Warsaw, but the population of the city has not decreased. The Warsaw Capital Police Department stipulates that two people must share a room, and in large households with "nine out of ten rooms empty," the police department forces them to rent out the remaining rooms. It is extremely difficult to find a hotel temporarily in Warsaw.

Warsaw has three hotels that "deal with foreign affairs": Polonia, Bristol, and Central. Before the war, Bristol was the largest in scale, but unfortunately it was destroyed by artillery fire and is now being repaired "on a large scale". Polonia is the most complete. The American ambassador, many diplomatic envoys, and even foreign reporters all live in Polonia. Because the Royal Air Force could not determine the date, I did not telegraph in advance and went to Polonia to ask for a room temporarily. The "shopkeeper" looked at me very awkwardly. I later learned that to stay at the Polonia Hotel, you must have a notice from the Polish Foreign Ministry before you are allowed to move in. The embassy called the Foreign Ministry for me, and the Polish Foreign Ministry gave a wonderful answer: "Was this reporter invited by the Polish government, or did he request to come? If he was invited, he can live in Polonia!" Of course, I was sensible and looked for other ways. Finally, with the help of Mr. Bao Jinpu, the chargé d'affaires of the embassy, and Secretary Li Zhaorui, I moved into the Bristol Hotel, which was being "built on a large scale" and was half-finished.

In this way, I finally came to Warsaw, and with my first footstep, I stepped into the inner layer of the "Iron Curtain"! (Warsaw, July 19)

(Note: "Dzień dobry" in Polish means "Good morning"; "Do widzenia" or read as "琴貴" in Polish means "Thank you.)

Poland is Reborn Amidst the Ruins (Dispatch from Our Special Correspondent Mao Shuqing)

Editorial

### Thoughts on Teachers' Day

Today is the birthday of our nation's teacher, Confucius. Setting this day as Teachers' Day has a special meaning. The municipal authorities and various legal entities have set this day to hold celebrations and publicity to arouse the public's "respect for teachers and valuing the Tao", which is really worthy of our common praise. I would like to extend my heartfelt respect to the hard-working teachers all over the country.

Our country has traditionally respected teachers. Even in the villages today, we can still see every household posting red paper with black characters saying "Heaven, Earth, Country, Parents, Teacher" in the middle hall, burning incense and bowing every day. Among all kinds of occupations, why should we especially respect teachers? This is worth considering. We must know that the characteristic of the teaching profession is "sacrifice oneself for others", to "learn without being tired and teach without being weary". He is the nanny of the nation, the mentor of society, the leader of academic thought, and the model of the crowd. He undertakes the most basic work of nation-building.

Society is like a pyramid. At the top of the tower are great politicians, great military strategists, great scientists, great artists... receiving the respect, praise, and worship of society. But teachers, especially primary and secondary school teachers, are like the cornerstone placed at the lowest level of this great tower, bearing the greatest pressure. They have no fame, no fortune, no power; all they have is a passion to inspire students' innate wisdom and good character every day, and to fight against the depravity, stupidity, and bad habits of children and young people. This year, a middle school math teacher explains "linear equations," and next year it is still "linear equations." Although the teaching methods change, the content is still roughly the same. Year after year, the students become famous, but he is still explaining "linear equations". He stands at his post and works hard all year round, taking the students' achievements as his own achievements and the students' happiness as his own happiness. He himself has "light" and "heat", but this "light" and "heat" are often not understood by the general public. As a result, he seems to light up many candles, and he himself bears the reflection of these candles and gets glory and happiness. Teachers build hope and happiness on their students, and they just bury themselves in hard work, regardless of fame and fortune, and do not seek power, especially in today's Chinese society, especially in the countryside, drinking thin porridge to live. Therefore, the ideal teacher is a "sage", a "perfect man", an "unsung hero". Is such a teacher not worthy of our worship and respect?

The reasons why teachers deserve our respect are as mentioned above. But unfortunately, the spirit of traditional respect for teachers in China today has been lost. Part of the teachers themselves also seem to have changed their nature. When we think of words like "respect for teachers and valuing the Tao" or "strict teachers and respected Tao", and look at the current situation, we cannot help but worry all day long.

In today's society, money is often used to represent a person's status and success. The conditions of material life, of course, follow wealth. Teachers' lives are difficult, and they are inevitably seen as "poor and sour" by some people. The general morality of society has declined, and poverty is looked down upon, so how can there be "respect"? Even if someone talks about "respecting teachers", most of it is superficial and verbal. What is there about teachers that is worthy of the respect of the general public? No wonder junior high school graduates all enter high school and are unwilling to enter normal school. The number of high school graduates who volunteer to enter normal colleges is always less than that of universities, unless they want to get "public funding" before entering normal school. This is a fact that is obvious to all in the education circle. In many gatherings, we hear other friends advise teachers to change careers, saying that being a teacher is a lifetime without success. These conversations are often discovered among very close friends. The original intention is not malicious. Looking at the current situation, if this continues to evolve, those with a little ability will not want to be teachers. Even if they are teachers, it is only temporary, treating the school as a hotel and a place for the unemployed to live. Therefore, students' grades are declining day by day. Thinking of this, I cannot help but worry about our second generation and cry for the future of our nation! We sincerely hope that the authorities will quickly improve teachers' salaries, solve teachers' lives, and hope that people in society will recognize teachers' contributions to the country and the nation and change their contemptuous attitude. We must know that one more effort from teachers will cultivate one more unit of vitality for the country. Quickly look further ahead and be vigilant!

Secondly, let's talk about the teachers themselves. During the eight years of the Anti-Japanese War, they were displaced and in dire straits. After the war, they were still suffering, but most of the teachers still stood at their posts and worked hard. Although sometimes they felt that "it is better to die early than to suffer," they were able to recognize their responsibilities and strive hard with perseverance, which is enough to be a "teacher's role model" without shame. Teachers' life ideals are not understood by ordinary people; teachers' life values are not estimated by ordinary worldly people. This spirit of "hard work and self-sacrifice" is what our national spirit is entrusted to. Teachers themselves should have this ambition and this confidence. On the other hand, if teachers lose this ambition and confidence, and lose taking "students' progress" and "changing social customs" as the center of their life's happiness, then the work of teaching will naturally be tasteless. What is even more sad is that in today's society, there are sometimes those who run schools in name but are actually doing business, and there are also those who teach in name but are actually cheating for food, harming children and misleading all living beings. How can a person who does not cultivate virtue, does not speak of conduct, and is not proficient in learning lead children and young people and be a model for society? How can he arouse the respect of people in society? Although these are a minority, we hope that we can correct these mistakes on this solemn Teachers' Day. To make people in society "respect teachers and value the Tao", teachers must first be able to respect themselves!

In short, the essence of the teaching profession is noble, so it is worthy of our admiration, and its festival is even more worthy of our celebration. We want to call on people in society to recognize the essence of teachers' work, solve teachers' lives, and promote respect for teachers, but teachers themselves must also fully express their original learning and conduct that can make people spontaneously admire them. In this way, Teachers' Day can be more meaningful and valuable.

### Security Council Continues to Discuss the India-Netherlands Issue; Decides to Establish an Arbitration Committee; Consuls in Batavia Will Provide Reports; France Exercises Veto Power, Soviet Proposal Overturned

[This newspaper's report] San Francisco, 26th: The Security Council's proposal to mediate the India-Netherlands dispute has been formally accepted by Indonesia today. At the same time, Indonesia has also accepted the proposal for six consuls-general to monitor the implementation of the ceasefire order. The attitudes of the Netherlands are now attracting attention from all parties, but it is expected that the Netherlands will reject the Security Council's "mediation" efforts. Indonesia also agrees that the Netherlands and Indonesia should each select a member state of the Security Council, and the two member states should jointly select a third member state to form a three-nation committee to mediate the Netherlands-Indonesia dispute.

[United Press, Lake Success, 26th] The Security Council reconvened today, attempting to resolve the Indonesian case. First on the agenda was a proposal by the Belgian representative to ask the International Court of Justice to rule on whether the Security Council has the power to take action on this case. The Polish representative also put forward a resolution urging the Netherlands and Indonesia to abide by the ceasefire order. Soviet Representative Gromyko vehemently attacked the Belgian proposal. Some observers believe that Gromyko may again exercise his veto power.

[Reuters, New York, Lake Success, 25th] France today used its veto power for the first time in the Security Council to overturn a Soviet proposal to establish a committee by the Security Council to supervise the ceasefire order in Indonesia. It was the first time that a permanent member of the Security Council other than the Soviet Union had used its veto power. The Soviet proposal was voted on, with seven votes in favor, two against (Belgium and France), and two abstentions (China and the United Kingdom). Another joint resolution put forward by China and Australia to order the current consuls stationed in Batavia to supervise the ceasefire order was passed with seven votes in favor, none against, and four abstentions (the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, Poland, and Colombia). Prior to that, Soviet Representative Gromyko criticized the US proposal to establish an arbitration committee to assist in resolving the India-Netherlands dispute. The proposal advocated the appointment of representatives from three countries to form an arbitration committee, with two countries each designated by the parties to the dispute, and the third country designated by the two designated countries. Gromyko said that this was a typical example of attempting to circumvent the United Nations mechanism. US Representative Johnson refuted it and said that he did not believe that any member of the Security Council would seriously doubt the motives of the United States. After voting, the US proposal was passed with eight votes to zero, and the Soviet Union and three other countries abstained. During the debate today, Indonesian Representative Salim also spoke, asking the Security Council to recognize the Netherlands' launch of an act of aggression against Indonesia and order the Dutch army to withdraw from the territory of Indonesia. Salim expressed great doubt about the proposal to order the consuls in Batavia to investigate the situation in Indonesia, saying that these consuls mostly observed the situation through the eyes of the Dutch.

[Reuters, Lake Success, 26th] United Nations Secretary-General Lie told reporters today that the Security Council's passage of the US resolution to send a three-member commission to assist in resolving the Indonesian dispute did not make the disputing parties feel enthusiastic satisfaction. Indonesian Representative Salim admitted that the Security Council's decision to place Indonesia and the Netherlands on an equal footing when appointing representatives to the three-member commission was a victory for Indonesia, but said that Indonesia still believed that the Security Council should handle the entire incident.

### Inauguration of the Canberra Conference: Representatives from the US, Australia, and Canada Deliver Speeches Emphasizing the Early Conclusion of a Peace Treaty with Japan

[Reuters, Canberra, 26th] The conference of the British Commonwealth discussing the peace treaty with Japan was inaugurated at 11:00 AM this morning in the Australian Federal House of Representatives. All members of the Commonwealth, except Burma, are participating. Australian Prime Minister Chifley, as the host, welcomed the representatives on behalf of the Australian government and people. He stated that it was the first time such a conference had been held in a British dominion, which was of particular significance not only for Australia but for every constituent part of the Commonwealth. He expressed regret at Burma's failure to attend the opening ceremony and hoped that its representative would arrive in time to participate in subsequent meetings.

The conference immediately elected Chifley as chairman, followed by an opening address by Australian Foreign Minister Evatt. He expressed his regret that the world was still in a state that was neither peace nor war. He urged the representatives to reflect on the tragic phenomenon of today's world, as the old world had died and the new world had not yet been born, which should not be ignored. In discussing the peace treaty with Japan, Evatt declared, "We should strive to achieve justice and democracy for Japan. The British Commonwealth welcomes the active role of the United States in the Pacific region. We hope that, under the leadership of the United States, peace will finally come to this part of the world." British Chief Representative and Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations Addison then spoke, expressing his pleasure at the presence of representatives from India and Pakistan and hoping that this pleasant state of harmony would last forever. He reiterated that Britain did not want Japan to receive a harsh peace, but only a peace based on justice and democracy. However, he strongly emphasized that Japan's imperial territories must be stripped away to prevent the cultivation of institutions of aggression, as there was still doubt as to how far Japan had progressed on the road to peace. Addison continued, saying that Britain had agreed early in the war that the United States must bear the moral responsibility for peace in the Pacific and Asian regions, but this agreement did not mean that Britain would transfer its legitimate interests in the Pacific region to the United States. He urged the representatives not to forget that Japan was part of the Pacific and that Japan's rightful place within this circle should not be denied. Canadian Representative Claxton declared that peace and prosperity could not be established anywhere as long as one part of the world remained at peace while another remained at war. Therefore, the main condition for prosperity was comprehensive peace, and he hoped that all representatives would work to achieve this condition. New Zealand Prime Minister Fraser stated that this conference did not represent the British Commonwealth forming a faction against the United States. He said that the United States' leadership in the Pacific was a recognized fact, and the British Commonwealth did not intend to dispute this point and would further strengthen its position. He also echoed Addison's call for the early conclusion of a peace treaty with Japan.

### New Greek Cabinet Faces Difficulties: Liberal Party Demands Important Positions; Former Foreign Minister's Efforts to Form a Cabinet Thwarted Again

[Report from this newspaper] London, 26th Broadcast: Tsaldaris, who had spent three days attempting to form a new Greek government, officially announced today the failure of negotiations with the Liberal Party. Before the announcement, Tsaldaris had consulted with U.S. Ambassador MacVeagh for ninety minutes.

Tsaldaris emphasized that he was determined to proceed with his own plan to form a new government.

### Soviet Foreign Minister's Reply Does Not Help the Overall Situation: U.S. Officials Express Deep Dissatisfaction; The Korean Situation May Be Submitted to the United Nations

[United Press, Washington, 25th] Authoritative sources say, "Some officials" are increasingly emotional about the Korean issue, which the U.S. and the Soviet Union have been unable to resolve for over a year, and the claims of the United Nations. It is also said that U.S. officials are "extremely disappointed" with Molotov's note on Korea and are discussing adopting a thorough plan to resolve the Korean issue so that its provisional government can unify the entire country. Well-informed sources say that a very important action is "quite possible" to be announced next weekend.

Molotov's reply agreed with Marshall's proposal that the U.S.-Soviet Joint Commission should report the discussion to Moscow and Washington, but officials here believe that Molotov's reply does not help the situation at all. Moreover, the British did not reply even after the deadline (August 21st) for the committee designated by Marshall to report had passed. Molotov's observation of the current state of the committee makes these officials believe that it is hopeless to resolve the issue according to the Moscow Agreement of December 1945, and that even direct negotiations between Moscow and Washington will not be effective. Therefore, the United States' ability to resolve this issue is greatly limited. One aspect says that the United States can only return this issue to the Four Foreign Ministers Conference to discuss the Moscow Agreement, or submit it to the United Nations, or directly implement a plan for economic and political development in South Korea.

### Britain and the United States Have Reached an Understanding on the Exemption of Discriminatory Restrictions on Purchasing Goods; Eady Returns Home to Report on Negotiations

[Reuters, London, 25th] The British Cabinet ended its second emergency cabinet meeting in two weeks tonight. No official communique was issued after the meeting to explain what response the United States had to Britain's request to suspend the application of the non-discrimination clause in the loan agreement. Most observers believe that the United States has agreed not to regard Britain's failure to comply with this clause as a violation of the agreement.

At the same time, it is understood that the cabinet has also reached a resolution on some austerity measures, but these measures still need to be announced publicly by Prime Minister Attlee himself. It was previously heard that Sir Eady, the head of the British financial delegation who had just returned to London from Washington, went to 10 Downing Street, but he did not enter the cabinet meeting room, but went to the neighboring Treasury office. Upon arriving at the airport, Eady gave only slight hints about the extremely confidential resolutions reached in Washington. He said: "My purpose in going to the United States has been achieved. The discussion on the non-discrimination clause was very valuable. The problems facing Britain have been dealt with in the best possible good faith and understanding." After the cabinet has thoroughly reviewed the results of the Washington negotiations, it can decide whether it is necessary to purchase from countries other than the United States at will without being based on the proportion of purchases from the United States. According to the non-discrimination clause, Britain's purchases of food and raw materials from other countries must be reduced in proportion to the degree of reduction in imports from the United States.

Remaining Loans to Be Frozen

Today, most of Britain's loans from the United States have been used up, and the remainder has been frozen. Therefore, Britain's imports must be reduced to be equal to the exports earned. Washington revealed today that Britain will withdraw another 150 million U.S. dollars from the U.S. loan today, and another 150 million U.S. dollars can be withdrawn on Friday. The remaining 400 million U.S. dollars will be frozen indefinitely.

### President Zhang Furious: Supervisors Should Be Jointly Responsible for Tax Officials' Embezzlement; Lei Zhen Reports on Investigation in Shanghai at Executive Yuan Meeting

[Report from this newspaper, Nanjing, 26th] At the Executive Yuan's regular meeting on the 26th, Lei Zhen gave an impromptu report on the investigation of the Shanghai tax officials' corruption case, saying that according to the reports of Zhang Zhongyuan and others, tax officials did extort money from the Seven Furniture Stores, with so-called negotiation fees and other items in addition to the regular taxes, of which six were one-on-one, while the business established by Zhang Zhongyuan was less. The negotiations over dinner at Guanshengyuan were also confirmed. After the corrupt officials heard that the incident had occurred, they hurriedly returned the checks paid by the six stores. After Lei Zhen finished reporting, Yu Hongjun said that there were many personnel in the Ministry of Finance, and it was inevitable that there would be bad apples. If there was solid evidence, they would be severely punished. President Zhang was also very angry when he heard about this corruption, and said that the supervisors should also be jointly responsible. It is heard that after Lei returned to Beijing, in addition to reporting the investigation process at the Executive Yuan meeting, he also provided the investigation findings to the Ministry of Finance for reference. In addition, Wang Fuzhou, Director of the Direct Taxation Department, met with Lei Zhen on the 26th for a long conversation.

### Affected Furniture Merchants Claim Signing Statements Was Due to Enticement and Coercion

[Report from this newspaper] Regarding the case of embezzlement by tax auditors of the Direct Taxation Bureau, Director Lou Guowei stated the day before yesterday that when the bureau conducted its own investigation, six of the seven furniture stores involved had signed statements proving that there was no extortion or embezzlement. It is now learned that the aforementioned six Chinese furniture stores yesterday entrusted lawyer Ma Junshuo to send a letter to Director Lou, solemnly stating that the previous signed statements were due to enticement and coercion and were not legally binding. The original letter stated: "Respectfully, according to our clients, Zhu Jianni, of Zhu Genji Store, Cao Caigeng, of Wufu Store, Zhang Xianliang, of Senmao Store, Zhang Shouqi, of Wantai Store, and Yang Longquan, of Yang Longxing Store, our stores operate Chinese furniture in accordance with the law and pay taxes. Unexpectedly, Yu, Zhang, Liu, Zhang, Gao, Xie, Wang, and Yang, and other ten auditors from the Direct Taxation Bureau of this city, threatened and illegally demanded money from our stores on various pretexts. The matter was reported by Director Zhang Zhongyuan of the same industry association to Speaker Pan of the Municipal Council, and reported to the Ministry of Finance, and it was decided to send personnel to thoroughly investigate the case. Unexpectedly, after the bureau's staff read the news in the newspapers, they became fearful and hurriedly used lightning-fast means to come to our stores on the 23rd of this month and enticed and coerced us to sign statements proving that the bureau's staff had not demanded bribes in the past. Our stores, because Speaker Pan and Director Zhang had not yet returned to Shanghai at that time, were deeply afraid of being retaliated against, so we had to tolerate it temporarily. However, the fact that the bureau's staff demanded bribes in the past is clear and cannot be denied. Now that Speaker Pan has truthfully reported the matter to the central government, the bureau should strictly deal with the relevant staff in accordance with the facts, and it is impossible to erase everything with a piece of paper that tries to cover up the truth. Moreover, an untrue expression of intent is not legally binding and has no effect on our legal accusations. The above points should be communicated to the Director of the Direct Taxation Bureau of this city by your lawyer for solemn clarification, and we request that you conduct a strict investigation and deal with the matter to rectify official discipline and protect merchants. We hope that you will investigate and deal with the matter accordingly and reply to us as soon as possible."

### Airlines Planning to Raise Prices: Increased Gasoline Prices Greatly Affect Passenger and Freight Costs

[Report from this newspaper] The oil, machinery, and part of the salaries of foreign employees used by China and Central Airlines are paid in foreign exchange, accounting for more than 70% of the expenditure. Before the announcement of the new foreign exchange measures, the two companies had prepared detailed charts and figures and submitted them to the Ministry of Communications for transfer to the Executive Yuan for approval of official preferential foreign exchange, but no approval has been received so far. Now, the gasoline companies in this city raised the price of aviation gasoline by 100% in early July. On the 25th of this month, they notified the two companies that the price of gasoline must be paid at the market price of the U.S. dollar in the future. The two airlines stated yesterday that, if necessary, they may have to adjust passenger and freight prices in proportion to gasoline prices, but this must be based on whether they can obtain official-priced foreign exchange. Now that the Executive Yuan has refused to approve it, the companies will have to settle foreign exchange with the Equalization Fund at market prices, and the cost will increase by four or five times, and the air freight will also increase by four or five times accordingly.

### Supervision Envoy's Office Suspects Seven Points in the Thorough Investigation of UNRRA Embezzlement Case

[Report from this newspaper] Regarding the case of six senior officials of UNRRA being accused of corruption, the Supervision Envoy's Office has been actively investigating and collecting relevant information from various sources for several days. Yesterday, Chen Jianye, the section chief in charge of the case, told reporters that the investigation work had come to an end so far, and they were now starting to sort out the various materials obtained, including UNRRA's distribution of electric fans, wheat, and cotton in exchange for yarn, as well as the various documents of the "UNRRA Staff Association" that raised thirteen points of suspicion. Therefore, the sorting work is very heavy. However, this case is of great importance and has attracted the attention of all sectors of society. In order to clarify the truth as soon as possible, the Supervision Envoy's Office is seeking to be prompt in handling the case. If there are no other new discoveries, the sorting work can also be completed in a short period of time, and something may be announced at that time.

### Material Sold by Ticket System Distinguished by Open and Secret Procedures; No Appointment Order for the Director of the Resettlement Affairs Committee

East China News Agency: In the UNRRA embezzlement case, the Supervision Envoy's Office has been sending personnel to thoroughly investigate for several days and has discovered the following points where the office is suspected of embezzlement: (1) When UNRRA distributed electric fans, why did the applicants directly contact the manager of the purchasing and sales office instead of going through the receiving and dispatching office, and there were no records to check for the distribution of fans from beginning to end? (2) Why were more than 400,000 tons of wheat sold by UNRRA without public bidding, and the method of selling was ambiguous and unclear? (3) There are two types of bids for UNRRA's relief materials: open bids and secret bids. This point is not stipulated in the government's promulgated laws and regulations. What is an open bid and what is a secret bid is difficult to understand. (4) The head office once ordered more than 10 million worth of flour bags. According to the investigation results, why did the Finance Department pay all the money before seeing the goods, and without the consent of the Audit Office? (5) Why was Bingji Company, which won the bid for the canned food sold by the office's distribution office, not required to pay a deposit, and why was it allowed to pick up the goods in batches? This is unreasonable in terms of both reason and law. (6) Hu Keshi was transferred to the position of Director of the Fishery Management Office, but there was no appointment order from Huo Baoshu, Director of the office. This proves that Li Zhuomin, the Deputy Director of the office, exercised his power arbitrarily. (7) The treatment of all employees in the UNRRA barge assembly plant is twice as high as that of the employees in the UNRRA headquarters. This matter was not approved by Director Huo, and it was also created by Li Zhuomin's arbitrary power. The Supervision Envoy's Office has been conducting detailed investigations with the office on the above points in recent days to find out the truth.

[Report from this newspaper] Zhu Zhongkun, of 28 Gaojia Lane, Nanshi, went out to play with a neighbor at about 3:00 PM yesterday. When they passed the Bund of Zhongzheng East Road, they suddenly met Chen Baokui, a broker selling recruits.

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Tianjin District Court previously sent a letter to the local court in Shanghai, requesting an investigation into whether there was any relationship between Lin Man's fraud case and Fuzhong Company. The district court had summoned Song Ziliang, the general manager of the company, but since Song had traveled to the United States and had not returned, and the company's assistant manager, Lu Pinqin, was unable to respond to the summons due to stomach pain, they sent a letter to the district court yesterday stating that they had entrusted Secretary Liu Fengsheng to represent them in court, where he was questioned by Judge Zhong Xianda. Liu simply answered "no" or "don't know" to each point of the interrogation, such as whether there were any commercial dealings with the American Wade Trading Company, the American Hongyun Company, whether they had distributed Hongyun brand cigarettes, and the rumored that Fuzhong Company had received a guarantee of US$50 million from Hongyun Company.

### Dance Hall Industry Proposes: Organize Institutions to Train Employees in Vocational Skills Before Banning Dancing; Provide Basic Literacy Education to Dancers

[Report from Our Newspaper] Yesterday afternoon, representatives of the dance hall industry, including Sun Hongyuan and Zhu Yongming, took a petition to the Social Affairs Bureau to visit Director Wu. Since Director Wu was out on official business, they left the petition and returned, and plan to visit him again tomorrow.

The dance hall industry's petition proposes that before dancing is banned, the Social Affairs Bureau should work with the Dance Hall Industry Association to organize a vocational skills training institution for dance hall employees. During their free time from 9:00 AM to 2:00 PM, the Social Affairs Bureau should send personnel to guide employees and teach them various vocational skills, and provide basic literacy education to dancers. After the employees have mastered their skills, the Social Affairs Bureau can place them in various factories. After the dancers have gained basic knowledge, they can take on nursing or other occupations. The expenses of all training institutions will be raised by the industry association. The industry also believes that the purpose of banning dancing is to save money. In order to implement savings, the Social Affairs Bureau can order each dance hall not to sell expensive drinks such as foreign wines, so as not to consume resources, and at the same time stop issuing new dance hall licenses and stop registering new dancers to limit them.

### Solatium for the Fubo Case: 15 Million Per Person

Regarding the issue of compensation for the families of the officers and soldiers who died in the Fubo warship disaster, a solution has been agreed upon. It is stipulated that each officer and soldier will be given a one-time solatium of 15 million yuan. Hereafter the families cannot have any more transgressive actions or demands.

### The Car Rental Issue Has No Results, a Committee Will Be Formed to Adjudicate

[Report from Our Newspaper] In order to adjust the rickshaw rental issue, the Social Affairs Bureau convened the cart merchants and rickshaw pullers for the third time yesterday for mediation. The cart merchants demanded that the rent for each shift be 6 jiao, calculated at 95% of last month's workers' cost of living index. The rickshaw pullers requested that it be calculated at 65%. According to the July index, the merchants' request would be about 15,000 yuan for each shift, while the rickshaw pullers would only agree to within 10,000 yuan. The two sides were far apart and the negotiations were unsuccessful. According to the Social Affairs Bureau, the average income of rickshaw pullers for each shift is currently 30,000 yuan. Due to physical strength and other reasons, they can only work 20 shifts per month, with a monthly income of 600,000 yuan. Therefore, the rent cannot be too high, otherwise the rickshaw pullers will not be able to make a living. Now, the Social Affairs Bureau plans to form a committee with relevant agencies to adjudicate the matter.

### Falsified a Contract and Wanted to Defraud His Girlfriend of Money; Hardware Merchant Is Charged with Two Crimes; Xu Haiming Is Suspected of Perjury

[Report from Our Newspaper] Two years ago, hardware merchant Li Shifan fell in love with a young girl, Lu Ying (Lu Xiaoying). Li claimed to have no wife and obtained more than four taels of gold jewelry from Lu to secure a house in order to live in it after marriage. His wife found out about it, moved in first, and Lu, realizing that she had been deceived, broke off contact with Li. Later, Lu's sister became ill and entrusted Lu to manage the Meiguang Shoe Shine Company, which she ran on her own. In June of this year, Li borrowed the lease contract signed between Li and Lu from Li Tianxiang, the owner of the Meiguang Ice Room, and privately carved the name stamps of the Meiguang Company and Lu Ying. He forged a contract stating that Lu Ying and Li Shifan were partners in opening the Meiguang Company and attempted to defraud Lu. Lu reported the matter to the Xincheng Police Precinct, which requested the District Prosecutor's Office to investigate. Li then colluded with shipper Xu Haiming to give false testimony during the investigation. After the prosecutor investigated, he determined that Li had committed forgery and fraud, and Xu had committed perjury. Yesterday, they were both prosecuted.

### The Three Female Ticket Takers at the Majestic Theater Become the Focus of the Labor-Management Dispute; Mediation Failed, the Theater Requests Arbitration

[Report from Our Newspaper] Gu Ruofeng, deputy section chief of the mediation section of the Labor Department of the Social Affairs Bureau, and inspector Zhu Guilin, convened both parties at 10:00 AM yesterday morning to mediate the labor unrest in fifteen cinemas. The representatives of the capital were Wei Yunqing, Zhou Hongguang, Shi Tingpan, Hu Zhifan, and Zhou Yihua. The labor representatives present were Liu Guisheng, Cao Yongfu, Huang Yulin, and He Changgen. Huang Zuoxin and Qian Dayou of the Criminal Division of the Police Headquarters, and Fang Rusheng of the General Labor Union also attended to assist in the mediation. The labor-management dispute was quite intense during the meeting. The capital demanded that the labor side compensate for the losses during the strike and punish those who led and incited the strike. The labor side expressed dissatisfaction with the capital's employment of non-union members and the fact that the Majestic Theater still ordered three female ticket takers to serve. After repeated mediation, it was not until 1:00 PM that an agreement was reached that the three female ticket takers at the Majestic Theater would be transferred to the office of other first-run cinemas. The vacant position will be replaced by people transferred from other cinemas. The remaining unresolved matters will be mediated by the Social Affairs Bureau which will convene representatives of both parties again tomorrow morning.

The three female ticket takers at the Majestic Theater continued to serve in the theater yesterday afternoon. The Cinema Industry Association has scheduled a general meeting this morning to discuss the matter. The association expressed its dissatisfaction with the Social Affairs Bureau's notice ordering the three female ticket takers to temporarily stop working and has submitted the matter to the municipal government for arbitration.

According to reporters, the municipal government believes that the current employee strike violates the General Mobilization Law and is studying measures to deal with it. The municipal government will also thoroughly revise the minutes signed by both labor and management in the past to prevent loopholes and prevent future disputes when resolving the dispute.

### Applying Tax to Million-Dollar Estates; Tax Amount Highest for Yuchi Qiaqing; Tax Bureau Conducts Side Investigations, Already Determining Over a Hundred Units

[Special Report from This Newspaper] In the great city of Shanghai, with a population of over four million, someone dies and someone is born every moment of every day, 24 hours a day. According to statistics from the Municipal Civil Affairs Bureau, the monthly death toll is at least 1,600 people. Leaving aside those who die on the streets and those of the common class, assuming that each of Shanghai's 20 funeral homes has an average of one wealthy client per day, there would be more than 7,200 deaths of the asset-owning class in a year. These deceased individuals are excellent targets for the Direct Tax Bureau to levy inheritance tax. (It is assumed that there are many who qualify as the minimum for inheritance tax is one million yuan.) From last year to the present, the Shanghai Direct Tax Bureau has already investigated and determined the inheritance tax for over a hundred units, and is currently investigating dozens more. Among the more than one hundred units that have been determined, the highest tax amount is undoubtedly for Yuchi Qiaqing. When Old Mr. Yuchi passed away in Chongqing in the spring of the 34th year of the Republic [1945], this city had not yet been recovered. His estate in Shanghai was only reported to the Direct Tax Bureau by his estate management committee after the victory. As far as we know, Old Mr. Yuchi's real estate, such as the Great Shanghai Cinema, the Jinghua Restaurant on Fourth Avenue, Fuzhi Lane on Guangxi Road, and Chunghua New Village on Jing'an Temple Road, are all well-known prime properties.

Minor Disputes Among the Yuchi Brothers

In April of this year, the elder Mr. Yuchi's estate caused a dispute among his three sons, Shun'en, Shunmao, and Shunwei. Near Chengdu Road on Jing'an Temple Road, Old Mr. Yuchi had two pieces of real estate totaling twelve mu, six li, and six hao (including the Goldfish Market). These were originally managed by the eldest son, Shun'en. At the estate management committee meeting, Shun'en suddenly reported to his two younger brothers that the real estate had been sold to someone else in February for 158 gold bars. Shunmao and Shunwei found this a bit suspicious. Based on the current value, the real estate was worth over 1,000 gold bars, ten times the amount reported by Shun'en. The two sides refused to concede, and for a time, the dispute became quite heated. Later, the eldest sister's husband, Jiang Yiping, stepped in to mediate, which prevented litigation. From this one incident, we can get a glimpse of the richness of Yuchi Qiaqing's estate. However, the inheritance tax law stipulates that the valuation of the estate should be based on the value on the date of the deceased's death. Therefore, the elder Mr. Yuchi's inheritance tax amount is not as astonishing as might be expected, but it is not too small either, probably around two to three billion yuan!

Tax Amount Determined for Shi Shengzhi

After Yuchi Qiaqing, the next should be Shen Lianfang. Shen Lianfang's name is also quite familiar in Shanghai. He was a tycoon in the silk cocoon industry, having served as chairman of the Silk Cocoon Guild of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces, vice president of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, and director-general of the Zhabei Charity Association. His businesses, such as Hua An Fire and Marine Insurance Company, Hengfeng Silk Store, Jiangyin Liyong Yarn Factory, Shanghai Fengye Insurance Company, China Silk Industry Bank, and Suzhou Taihe Flour Mill, owned many residences and properties in this city. Although the total value of his estate is not as high as Yuchi Qiaqing's, his death date was later than Yuchi's, so his tax amount, based on the current value for tax determination, is not much different from the elder Mr. Yuchi's.

Shi Zhaozeng, known as Shengzhi, the eldest brother of Shi Zhaoji, a veteran of the diplomatic circles, passed away this year at the age of 82. In the late Qing Dynasty, he served as a county magistrate, reaching the rank of second-class Jiangxi Taoist official. He served as Consul General in New York in the United States. After returning to China, he worked in the railway industry, successively serving as director of the Hanyang Iron Factory in Hubei, concurrently managing the Beijing-Hankou Railway project, and director-general of the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway and China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. In the early years of the Republic of China, he once again served as a diplomat. In the 11th year of the Republic [1922], he switched from politics to business, founding the Zhabei Water and Electricity Plant and serving as chairman of Wing Hang Bank and Jiu An Industrial Company, among others. Shi Shengzhi was good at being an official and good at doing business. His estate is also indeed considerable. Shi's sons and nephews are well aware of national laws and tax obligations. They prepared an estate inventory within the deadline, and the Direct Tax Bureau determined his tax amount very smoothly. Shi Jiumao, general manager of Daxin Zhen Piao Printing and Dyeing Weaving Factory, is also a well-known figure among the Ningbo expatriates in Shanghai. He started as an apprentice at Shentai Chang Cotton Cloth Store in Xiaodongmen. In the 25th year of the Republic [1936], he opened Daxin Zhen Piao Printing and Dyeing Weaving Factory, Tongqing Cotton Cloth Store, and served as general manager of China Investment Management Company. Although his inheritance tax is less than Yuchi's, Shi's, and Shen's, it will still be in the hundreds of millions of yuan.

A Well-Managed Concubine

The well-known units currently under investigation by the Direct Tax Bureau include Mu Ouchu, the former director of the Shanghai Pre-War Gauze Exchange, who died in Chongqing. His main assets are the Deda and Housheng yarn factories. Also under investigation are Xiang Shengwu, the general manager of Wuzhou Pharmacy, and Xu Dexin, the manager of Dazhong Hardware Machinery Factory, who recently passed away. Among them, the wealthiest estate, which the Direct Tax Bureau is currently focusing on, is that of Sun Zhang Biru, the concubine of Sun Hengfu, the general manager of Siming Bank. This Mrs. Sun was good at accumulating and managing assets during her lifetime. She owned over 20 houses in the Wujiaochang area of Changning Road, and individual residences and Western-style houses on Yuyuan Road and Jessfield Road, as well as a sedan car and a jeep. She also owned shares in Chuanshan Shipping Company and flour mills. In her hometown of Cixi, she also owned residences, farmland, and shops. The safe deposit box at Siming Bank also contains numerous jewelry, gold bars, and diamond rings. In addition to notifying the heirs of Sun Zhang Biru's estate to declare, the Tax Bureau is also conducting a side investigation.

Inheritors of Lo Ka Ling Get a Bargain

Inheritance tax can be said to be a new tax in China. Although it was implemented in the rear during the War of Resistance on July 1, 1940, it was only levied in the recovered areas on September 2, 1945. The tax law stipulates that if the deceased died in the recovered areas before September 2, 1945, the portion of their estate in the recovered areas is tax-exempt, thus benefiting the heirs of the Lo Ka Ling, the wife of Silas Aaron Hardoon. However, those who died in the rear after July 1, 1940, are subject to tax regardless of whether their estate is in the rear or the recovered areas, such as Yuchi Qiaqing and Mu Ouchu. When the Legislative Yuan passed the Inheritance Tax Law, it did not anticipate that the legal tender would depreciate so much, so the minimum threshold for inheritance tax was set at one million yuan. Recently, the Tax Administration decided to raise it to 30 million yuan, but with prices constantly rising, 30 million yuan seems insignificant today, so the Tax Administration is still considering revising it.

### Drought in Water Country; Both Banks of Qiantang River; Soil Cracks and Leaves Wither; Disaster Situation More Severe in Eastern Zhejiang Mountainous Areas

Huangni Water Used for Drinking in Haining and Tongxiang Counties

Currently, the disaster area is widespread on both banks of the Qiantang River. Counties in eastern and western Zhejiang that have reported drought conditions include: Hangzhou, Haining, Haiyan, Yuhang, Jiashan, Jiaxing, Lin'an, Yueqing, Xiaoshan, Zhuji, Yuyao, Yin County, Huangyan, Xuanping, Wenling, Yongjia, Linhai, Tongxiang,  Yang, and Wu, totaling ten counties, nearly one-third of the province's total. The area north of the railway in Hangzhou, Jiaxing, and Huzhou is still okay, but the cracking of the soil has become a widespread phenomenon south of the railway. Riverbeds have dried up, and steamers cannot operate. What is particularly bad is that the drinking water has become a major problem in various counties. In counties such as Haining and Tongxiang, only muddy yellow water can be found, which will greatly affect the health of farmers. However, they are already very happy to have water to drink. In some places such as Haining, Yuanmu, Chengdong, Wengbu, and Xucun, there is no water available for washing faces or bathing, and drinking tea has become a luxury. When passersby are thirsty and ask villagers for water, they have to run to several homes to get two wine cups of yellow mud water. Therefore, there are no idlers in the villages. Men, women, old and young, even children, take water buckets, even tiles, and run to the Qiantang River, more than a dozen miles away, to fetch water to drink. This kind of hardship is unimaginable for people in the city who drink tap water.

Fifty Water Pumps Hopefully Sent to Zhejiang Immediately for Disaster Relief

Originally, the fields in the Hangzhou-Haining area relied on West Lake water for irrigation. The people of Hangzhou, thanks to the blessings of the West Lake, send the lake water to the counties of Hangzhou and Haining, and let them bear the burden of grain taxes. After the disaster occurred in the area along the Shangtang River this year, the Municipal Bureau of Public Works opened West Lake water on the 16th. However, according to Director Shen, "Since the 16th, the water level has dropped by 5 centimeters after 24 hours of release. After a total of 68 hours of release, the water level has dropped by 10.5 centimeters, releasing a total of 507,000 cubic meters of lake water. However, the weather is extremely dry, and the evaporation and infiltration are extremely high. The water level of the Shangtang River has only risen by 2 to 3 centimeters. The lake water only reaches Xiaomao Bridge near Linping, which is 23 kilometers from Hangzhou and 29 kilometers from Haining." Because Mayor Zhou loves West Lake, he seems reluctant to open the lake water, so it is opened and stopped, as if only to respond to the opinions of others. After Chairman Shen personally inspected the disaster situation on the Shangtang River on the 22nd, he ordered the water to be opened for another ten days. At the same time, he asked the water plant to run the water pumps for four more hours to draw water into the Shangtang River. On the other hand, the Zhejiang branch of the soon-to-be-closed Executive Yuan borrowed three 6-inch water pumps from the Tangjiang Bureau to draw water in Chang'an to help irrigation. At the same time, Directors Sun and Zhu and Chief Pi of the Construction Department went to Shanghai to ask the Executive Yuan to expedite the transport of the 50 water pumps originally allocated to Zhejiang to Zhejiang to save the drought. Among them, the components of 20 pumps have arrived in Hangzhou City and will be distributed to the disaster areas in Hangzhou, Jiaxing, and Huzhou after the other components arrive. After the remaining 30 pumps arrive in Hangzhou, they will be distributed to the remaining counties in eastern and western Zhejiang that have been affected by the disaster to provide free water pumping.

Autumn Harvest Discounted to 70% if Water Available Soon

However, the affected counties not only need water, but are in urgent need of water. If there is enough water for irrigation soon, the autumn harvest will be discounted to 70%. Without water, the harvest will of course be hopeless, and many farmers do not trust the water of the Qiantang River. Because it is salty. During the great drought in the 23rd year of the Republic [1934], farmers also used river water, but the crops withered and the ears did not bear fruit, resulting in a big harvest failure! What's more, farmers need water now, but the water pumps are still on Fuxing Island! According to the estimates of Xuanping farmers: the wages for the autumn harvest are 12,000 yuan per worker, and 4 workers are needed per mu. The cost of food is equivalent to 1 dan of grain, and the cost of sowing, construction, and fertilizer per mu is equivalent to 2 dan of grain. The rent per mu is 2 dan. If each mu can still harvest 5 dan, it will still lose more than 1 dan. Some tenant farmers still borrow money to grow rice. Borrowing 1 dan requires returning 1.5 dan. Even in good years, they are quite stretched. Now that there is a drought, their lives are unimaginable. In desperation, they have to entrust their fate to the gods. Currently, Wuyi, Wenling, Yin County, Zhuji, Yueqing, and Haining are all praying to the gods and saints, welcoming the dragon, and praying for rain. In some places, they carry the Bodhisattva to tour the disaster area, hoping to touch the heart of the Bodhisattva and drop some sweet rain, but not a single drop of rain has fallen, and a lot of money has been spent. Some places are publicly levied, 20,000 yuan per mu, and from this base, one can imagine the scale of the expenditure. The provincial government is still actively rescuing the situation (the effectiveness of which depends on the speed of implementation) and has not yet made passive relief plans. They hope that farmers will switch to growing miscellaneous grains to make up for the need for food. However, in the case of poor harvests and droughts, in addition to coping with the mandatory requisition and borrowing, farmers still have to rely on their own miscellaneous grains to survive, which may have become a difficult situation. Therefore, I deeply hope that the authorities can have a deeper level of relief plans to alleviate the current suffering of rural Zhejiang. The great drought of the 23rd year of the Republic [1934] is about to be repeated, but we deeply hope to let the suffering villagers suffer less. (Reporter Huang Xingtian)

### Severe Drought in Jiaxing

[Report from Our Newspaper in Jiaxing on the 25th] Due to continuous days of drought without rain, the fields in various towns and villages in this county have cracked, and insect plagues are frequent.

If it does not rain again within the week, the autumn harvest will be hopeless.

### Linping Drought Area; Building Ponds to Store Water and Sell at a Good Price; Saving One Mu of Farmland Crops Costs as Much as 300,000 Yuan

[Report from Our Newspaper in Hangzhou on the 24th] In Yuhang, storing water to irrigate fields has benefited more than 3,000 mu, but this amount is too small, and there is no water to store elsewhere at all. Even if there is some that can be stored, it is occupied by private individuals. Here is a story: In the Linping area, some farmers built ponds to store water and sell it at a good price. For those who want to draw water from the pond to irrigate with old-fashioned manual water carts, they need to pay 60,000 yuan for every 100 turns of the water cart. The efficiency of the manual water cart is very low. According to the actual experience of farmers, this amount of water is only enough to irrigate two fen of land. That is to say: to save one mu of farmland crops, it costs 300,000 yuan, which is about the market price of one dan of rice. This is beyond the ability of ordinary farmers to afford, so they have to let the eared rice wither and turn yellow. Some sugarcane growers, because the profit is higher, are competing to hire workers to irrigate. But when the pond water is drawn dry, the fields along the Shangtang River are still bound to become barren.

Three water pumps are pumping water in Chang'an, Haining at 6 a.m. This is one of the drought relief stations set up by the Zhejiang Branch of the Executive Yuan. The picture shows the water release situation.

Ministry of Food Announces Measures for Limited Flour Transit at Beijing, Zhenjiang, and Shanghai Ports; August Quota for Fourth District Flour Transit Set at 300,000 Bags
　　In order to cooperate with the National General Mobilization Law, the Ministry of Food will immediately regulate the circulation of food in the Yangtze River provinces. The four major food items, rice, grain, wheat, and flour, in Shanghai were previously ordered by the Executive Yuan last year to require prior approval from the Ministry for transit. Furthermore, in April of this year, the aforementioned four food items in Jiangsu Province experienced a sharp price increase due to large-scale procurement and transportation. Regulations were established allowing free circulation of grain, rice, wheat, and flour within Jiangsu Province and to Beijing and Shanghai. Transportation to other provinces must be approved by the Ministry. Recently, the Ministry has received numerous requests to lift the restrictions, and the Ministry has stipulated the following: (1) Outward transportation of rice from Shanghai will continue to be handled in accordance with the rice transit measures approved by the Executive Yuan. (2) Export of wheat from Shanghai will remain temporarily restricted. (3) Food in the provinces along the Yangtze River should circulate freely. However, transportation beyond the Yangtze River estuary to other coastal provinces for sale must be reported to and approved by the Ministry before export is allowed. (4) Starting in August, flour in Beijing, Shanghai, and Jiangsu Province will follow the flour transit quota measures approved by the Executive Yuan. The Ministry will announce the transit quantity each month based on production and sales conditions. It is reported that the approved transit quantity for the Fourth District in August is 300,000 bags. The measures for limited flour transit are summarized as follows:
　　(1) In order to ensure sufficient food supply for the residents of northern and southern provinces such as Ping, Tianjin, Qing, Zhejiang, Fujian, and Guangdong, and to develop the flour industry, a limited quota system for flour transit will be implemented starting in August of the 36th year.
　　(2) Flour transit is limited to the three ports of Shanghai, Zhenjiang, and Nanjing.
　　(3) The monthly transit quota will be determined and announced by the Ministry of Food based on production and sales conditions, and relevant agencies and organizations will be notified for compliance.
　　(4) The monthly transit quota approved by the Ministry of Food will be distributed fairly among the factories by the Fourth District Flour Industry Association (hereinafter referred to as the Fourth District Flour Association) based on their production volume. A detailed distribution list must be submitted to the Ministry of Food for record. Transit beyond the quota is prohibited, except for cases deemed necessary and specially approved by the Ministry of Food.
　　(5) Manufacturers located in Jiangsu Province and Beijing and Shanghai who are members of the Fourth District Flour Association may apply for transit. The five factories of Fuxin, Fufeng, Maoxin, Huafeng, and Yutong will have separate transit quotas determined by the Ministry of Food and are not subject to this quota distribution.
　　(6) Grain merchants who have registered with the Ministry of Food and hold a business license for grain distribution may purchase flour for external sales. However, the selling manufacturer must apply for transit on behalf of the merchant and guarantee the merchant's status as a legitimate grain distributor. Procurement and transportation certificates issued by local government agencies to local grain merchants are invalid.
　　(7) Whether transporting the flour themselves or selling it to legitimate grain merchants, manufacturers applying for transit must not exceed the quantity allocated by the Fourth District Flour Association. However, any unused quota from the previous month may be combined with the current month's quota.
　　(8) Manufacturers may choose the port for transit. Before the flour is shipped, they must apply to the Ministry of Food to have the customs or tax authorities at the transit destination verify and approve the release.
　　(9) The customs and tax authorities mentioned in the previous article are the Jianghai Customs in Shanghai, the Jinling Customs in Nanjing, and the Zhenjiang Goods Tax Bureau in Zhenjiang. The customs will not release the flour without receiving notification from the Ministry of Food. The Zhenjiang Goods Tax Bureau will not issue tax invoices without receiving notification from the Ministry of Food.
　　(10) If legitimate manufacturers purchase flour from provinces and cities upstream of the Yangtze River outside the areas stipulated in Article 5 of these measures and transport it through the Yangtze River estuary to coastal areas, they must first submit the purchase and sales location, quantity, grain merchant license, and flour mill certificate to the Ministry of Food for verification. Upon approval, the local customs or tax authorities will be notified to release the flour.
　　(11) The Ministry of Food's transfer of flour to supply military and civilian needs will be reported by the Shanghai General Warehouse to the Ministry of Food, which will then notify the Jianghai Customs to release the flour, without being subject to the restrictions of these measures.
　　(12) These measures will take effect from the date of their announcement.

Active Off-Exchange Trading, Chinese Stocks Continue to Advance
　　Chinese stocks continued to advance yesterday. Stimulated by material and financial news, a Mr. Yang covered 40 million shares shorted off-exchange. Large off-exchange traders thrived, aggressively raising prices to over 252 yuan. As a result, the exchange was also forced to rise sharply. Near noon, there was a pullback, as shorts were covered and long positions were taken.
　　The market opened steadily. After Yongsha opened, numbers 219 and others sold at high prices. Later, numbers 12, 73, 224, 102, and 85 came in to buy, and number 130 even bought current Yongsha, pushing the price up to 240 yuan. A constant supply of funds prevented high prices from lasting. Later, due to a sudden increase in off-exchange interest rates to 1.5 and 1.95 jiao, many sellers appeared, driving the price down to 232 yuan. At this point, the buying side suddenly strengthened, and Mr. Yang aggressively covered shorts off-exchange. Xiangshu brand arbitrarily raised prices to over 252 yuan, causing the price to rise to highs of 249 and 250 yuan. The morning surge passed, and the market closed lower at 243 and 244 yuan at noon.

Shantou Shipping Company Responsible for Salvaging "Heichao Maru" Oil Tanker
　　A large oil tanker, the "Heichao Maru," with a deadweight of 10,000 tons, sank in Kaohsiung Harbor, Taiwan, having been bombed during the war. The Taiwan shipping authorities initially considered it of little use and began dismantling it. After the government learned of this, and realizing that the country was in dire need of oil tankers, they telegraphed Chairman Wei to order a halt to the dismantling and sent personnel to investigate. The ship was built in Japan in Showa year 14 (1939), was only six years old, and had a very high speed, making it one of the largest oil tankers in the country. Dismantling it would be a great pity. It is now understood that the government has instructed the China Oil Tanker Company to expedite the salvage and repair of the ship to increase oil transportation capacity. It is also reported that the repair project plan has been finalized and construction will begin in the coming days.

Dried Lily Bulbs Continue to Rise
　　Dried lily bulbs have continued to rise in price because Cantonese merchants have been actively purchasing them, and supplies in stock are gradually dwindling.

China Trust Bureau Purchases Over 36,000 Bales of Foreign Cotton
　　[Central News Agency, Shanghai] Regarding the purchase of foreign cotton that arrived without import permits, the Central Trust Bureau convened a review committee after the application deadline of August 15th.

For the most part, the CIF foreign exchange was telegraphed by the National Bank to foreign manufacturers. The foreign banks and foreign importers involved expressed satisfaction, believing that the government's solution to the long-standing case of cotton that had arrived nearly a year ago demonstrated consideration for the difficulties faced by businesses and would contribute to the future of China's international trade. The Central Trust Bureau has been in frequent contact with various weaving mills to discuss the issue of yarn delivery. It is understood that the factories can first advance a portion of cotton yarn for export. The remainder will be delivered within one and a half months, and it is hoped that the foreign exchange paid for the cotton can be recovered with a surplus in the short term.

Actual Sales Active, Production Gradually Decreasing: Yarn and Cloth Prices Rising Daily; Textile Mills Association Appeals for Increased Power Supply
　　[Reported by this newspaper] Shu Yunzhang, General Manager of China Textile Construction Company, told reporters yesterday that the recent surge in yarn and cloth prices is due to the gradual increase in actual sales, but the decreasing production volume is also a major factor. The main reason for the decline in production volume is the unreliable power supply. Considering the spindles owned by China Textile Construction Company in this city, if the power supply were sufficient, 840,000 spindles could be operated day and night. However, due to insufficient power, only an average of over 600,000 spindles can be operated day and night. Therefore, it is urgently hoped that the municipal government will actively find ways to ensure the power supply for production enterprises, especially by reducing wasteful and unnecessary power consumption.
　　[Further news] The National Textile Mills Association also telegraphed the Executive Yuan, requesting that measures be taken to increase the power supply for production enterprises in various regions to facilitate increased production and stabilize prices.

Cotton Yarn Rises Again
　　Yesterday, the cotton yarn market surged due to the influx of capital fleeing Hong Kong, which resulted in an overabundance of cash. Speculators in the market were actively pushing prices up, and buyers were also actively purchasing, leading to a rapid rise in prices.

The prices of other counts of coarse and fine yarns also rose by varying amounts, ranging from 500,000 to 800,000 or 900,000 yuan.

More Buyers for Cotton Cloth
　　Yesterday, the rising trend in the cotton cloth market intensified. Buyers and dyers were purchasing low-grade fine cloth, which stimulated traders and speculators, leading to a scramble to buy. Sellers raised prices, and the market became increasingly profitable. At around 10:30 AM, Longtou fine cloth rose to 494,000 yuan. Later, it was reported that China Textile Construction Company had set lower cloth prices, leading to some profit-taking sales. The final price was 485,000 yuan, continuing to rise by 15,000 yuan compared to the previous month. The prices of other grades of fine cloth, such as Wufu Caiqiu and Yanghe, also rose by 15,000 to 31,000 yuan. Sijunzi and Jinlian Miaowu and other types of flannel rose sharply because China Textile Construction flannel had not yet been put on sale, so prices rose by around 30,000 yuan.

Hainan brown sugar opened especially high at 630,000 yuan, up about 30,000 yuan, totaling several dozen packages. Stocks of Diaoqing brand were gradually dwindling, and new arrivals were scarce. Spot prices opened sporadically at 500,000 yuan, up 30,000 yuan. Prices among traders were 510,000 yuan.

　　In addition, the maximum monthly amount of foreign exchange available for Schedules 1 and 3A, originally set at US$2 million for Schedule 1 and US$2.5 million for Schedule 3A, remains unchanged. However, whether the full amount can be allocated will depend on the Foreign Exchange Equilibrium Fund Committee's monthly assessment of the foreign exchange position.

Tea Market Sluggish
　　Recently, trading in foreign tea markets has remained stagnant. Because exporters have not yet received responses from overseas to the various grades they have solicited, buying interest remains sluggish. Sellers, since the announcement last week by the authorities of new measures for managing foreign exchange, have stabilized their mindset and are not discouraged, so supply and demand remain balanced throughout the process. Overall, this situation is likely to continue to be quiet for the time being. As for domestic sales, both local shops and out-of-town buyers report a lack of sales, and the situation remains flat.

Wool Market Prices Chaotic
　　Yesterday, wool prices became chaotic again. Bids from various shops varied widely, and trading was mostly observed by local merchants, with the exception of some purchases by out-of-town buyers.

[Our Newspaper Report] Minister of Education Chu Chia-hua, accompanied by Secretary Fang Chih-mao, flew to Peiping, Tientsin and the Northeast to inspect them a week ago. Yesterday at 5 p.m., he returned to Shanghai from Peiping on the Sky Master. Peking University President Hu Shih, Professor Qian Duansheng, Tsinghua University President Mei Yi-qi, Professor Pan Guangdan, and Peiping Research Institute Director Li Shu-hua and others, a total of five people, came south on the same plane. Wu Shao-shu, Executive Director of the Shanghai Youth Corps, Gu Yuxiu, Director of the Education Bureau, and many others went to Longhua Airport to welcome them. After disembarking from the plane, Chu went to his private residence to rest and took a train back to Beijing last night. According to Secretary Fang Chih-mao, Chu's trip was very detailed. He inspected various schools in Peiping and said that Minister Chu was very saddened by the destruction of schools in the Northeast. It will definitely not be possible to restore them in a day or two. The Ministry of Education will gradually find ways to improve them. Fortunately, local officials have agreed to provide full assistance, and they will be able to gradually enrich them. At the same time, in addition to the students in the Northeast who have dropped out of school and have been transferred to other schools one after another, the universities in the Northeast will increase the number of classes in the next semester to allow students who have dropped out of school to continue their studies.

Hu Shih Willing to be a Voter in the General Election

[Another Report] Hu Shih of Peking University arrived in Shanghai yesterday and stayed at the International Hotel. When reporters visited him last night, Mr. Hu was also present. Mr. Hu told us: "This trip is to participate in the preparatory committee meeting for the Academia Sinica academician election to be held in Beijing tomorrow (the 28th). The committee is divided into three groups: mathematics and physics, biology, and humanities, with five members in each group. The meeting of the preparatory committee will review and organize the list of academician candidates and submit it to the first academician council meeting to be held at the end of next month for review. The final decision will be made when the second council meeting is held next spring. The number of elected academicians may be between eighty and one hundred." When asked by the reporter whether it was true that Hu Shih would participate in the election of senators in Peiping, Hu Shih said: "I am willing to be a voter and have entrusted my national identity card to a friend to write the ballot for me." Hu Shih then expressed his views on the general election, saying: Democratic politics is education and training. This is the first time our country has conducted a general election. Whether it is good or bad, it is always a kind of experience and lesson. The learning method lies in practice. It should not be regarded as a difficult task and should be done seriously. When asked by the reporter whether Hu Shih would participate in the election, Hu Shih said: "I am also willing to be a voter." When the reporter asked Hu Shih about his thoughts on General Wedemeyer's farewell statement the day before, Hu Shih said that he had been ill for more than a week and had not seen the newspaper of that day before he left. He only saw the Shen Bao of the 24th on the plane yesterday, so he could not talk about it. Regarding the issue of the treatment of professors in Peiping and Tianjin, Hu Shih said that after the adjustment of the treatment of public educators this time, Peiping increased by 300,000 yuan, which is not enough to buy 30 kilograms of rice or a small bag of flour. The lives of professors are unspeakably miserable, which is a mistake of the government. Hu Shih had been ill for more than a week and did not intend to attend the meeting. However, because Fu Mengzhen and Tao Menghe, who participated in the humanities group of the committee, are now abroad, if he does not attend, there will not be enough quorum, so he came south despite his illness. Hu Shih will go to Beijing today to attend the preparatory committee meeting for the Academia Sinica academician election and also intends to attend the UNESCO China Committee. After the meeting, he will return to Shanghai by plane to return to Peiping.

### Municipal Government Holds Principals' Meeting Yesterday and Decides Maximum Tuition Fees for Private Schools: Elementary School 500,000, Junior High School 800,000, Senior High School 1 Million

[Our Newspaper Report] The standard for collecting tuition and miscellaneous fees for private primary and secondary schools in this city for the next semester was determined by the private schools themselves to be 600,000 for elementary school, 900,000 for junior high school, and 1.2 million for senior high school. Most students' parents felt that the standard was too high and they could not afford it. The Municipal Government specially convened a meeting of more than 100 principals of private primary and secondary schools in the conference room at 3:30 p.m. yesterday to discuss ways to appropriately reduce fees. Mayor Wu presided over the meeting, accompanied by Gu Yuxiu, Director of the Education Bureau, Li Ximou, Deputy Director, and others. Mayor Wu first gave a speech, saying that since the amount of tuition and miscellaneous fees for private schools was announced, he had received dozens of petitions from students' parents, all saying that the fees for private schools were too high and pointing out that the expenses of some schools were not made public, expressing their opposition. After investigation, it was found that Nanyang Middle School's expenses were completely open, and the interest on deposits was distributed to teachers. On the contrary, the expenses of some private schools were all controlled by the principal alone, and the lives of teachers were unspeakably miserable. These two opposite situations have been confirmed, and it has been decided to reward and punish them separately. It should be known that the outside world calls private schools "academic shops" and puts forward the slogan of "anti-academic shops," which is the greatest shame for the government and the education community. Mr. Wu said in an angry tone. I have decided to ask the school's board of directors to replace the principal to establish a noble style in the education community. Mr. Wu then said that the number of free places set up by various private schools is mostly not true to the name, with the lower ones only accounting for 4%, and even using the student aid funds donated by the outside world as their own free places, which is extremely indignant. Then, principals Jiang Jizhou, Cui Jianwu and others reported on the process of setting tuition fees for private schools, saying: At that time, because the exchange rate was uncertain, they were sincerely afraid of price fluctuations, so the number set was slightly higher. At the same time, in view of the increase in tuition fees for private universities, primary and secondary schools had to increase. Mayor Wu immediately reprimanded them for their merchant habits, and the amount of fees should meet their own needs. After a heated discussion, the key points of the resolution were as follows: (1) In the last symposium, it was decided that the number of half-fee and free places should be sufficient, the economy should be open, the fees should be deposited in designated banks, and the interest should be used for school expenses, and 70% of the expenses should be paid to teachers' salaries. The above items must be strictly implemented. (2) The maximum tuition fees for each school: 500,000 for elementary school, 800,000 for junior high school, and 1 million for senior high school. However, private primary and secondary schools with a long history, complete equipment, excellent performance, and open economy may collect fees of 600,000, 900,000, and 1.2 million after submitting an application to the Education Bureau for approval. (3) During the semester, schools must not arbitrarily collect any fees. If there are any violations of the Education Bureau's regulations, such as cleverly establishing names, falsely reporting, etc., once discovered, the Education Bureau will strictly punish them or take them over for city management.

### Key to the League Tennis Championship Lies in the Game Between the Physical Education Association and Jinlan Today, The Outcome of Shanghai vs. Green Light is Related to the Future

The key to their gains and losses with the Physical Education Association depends on the results of the two teams' games against Jinlan and Green Light.
