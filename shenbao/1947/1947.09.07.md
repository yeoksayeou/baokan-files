### The Overall Situation Has Entered a Period of Pacification; Suppressing the Rebellion in the Northeast Will Not Be Difficult; Soviet Aid to the Communist Bandits Has Become an Ironclad Fact; Bai Chongxi and Xiong Shihui Issue Statements

[Special Dispatch from Our Nanjing Office, 6th] Minister of National Defense Bai Chongxi, on the 6th, received a reporter from a local evening newspaper, and issued a statement on the facts of Soviet aid to the Chinese Communists and the current war situation, stating: The Soviet Union, openly and brazenly, is aiding the Communist forces in the Northeast, which has become an ironclad fact. Before the Soviet army entered, there was absolutely no trace of Communist forces in the Northeast, but now the Northeast has become the Communist bandits' base camp. The Soviet army has indeed not actually participated in the war, but the Soviet army transferred hundreds of thousands of guns seized by them to the Communist army. Otherwise, where did the Communist bandits north of Changchun and in other areas of the Northeast get so many guns? The facts are all there, why deny it? Mr. Bai expressed great confidence in eradicating the Communist bandits, believing that the suppression of bandits and pacification of the rebellion will certainly be successful. However, he still hopes that the people will maintain strong confidence. He also has a clear view of the current war situation, pointing out that the overall situation has entered a period of pacification. The situation in Hubei and Anhui has been quite tense recently, but this is only due to the wandering of remnant bandits, and it will not have much impact. The Northeast bandit army is indeed about to launch its sixth offensive, but the National Army has heavily defended important strongholds, and Chief of Staff Chen is stationed in the Northeast, personally supervising the troops. The Communist bandits' attempt will not be difficult to crush. As for the situation in Guangdong and Guangxi, Mr. Bai believes that Li Jishen and his ilk are causing trouble, but without guns or bullets, how can they form an army? The rumor that there are 30,000 people is absolutely unbelievable, and he believes that it will definitely not have an impact. Mr. Bai also made a statement on foreign policy, especially emphasizing the necessity of self-reliance, but believing that American aid to China is also inevitable.

[Special Dispatch from Our Beiping Office, 6th] Xiong Shihui, after leaving his post and arriving in Beiping, received reporters publicly at his private residence on the morning of the 6th, breaking with precedent. He recounted the process of taking over the Northeast over the past two years, stating: After the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance, the government intended to take over the Northeast through diplomatic means. Therefore, I arrived in Changchun in October of the year before last. Later, because the Sino-Soviet Treaty was not respected by the Soviet side, it could not be implemented, and the hope of taking over through diplomatic means came to an end. During this period, the Chinese Communists took the opportunity to expand their strength. Later, the government changed to taking over through political means, and a three-person small team conducted mediation. In the end, because the Chinese Communists did not respect the ceasefire agreement and greatly expanded their military force, occupying territory, the door to political means was closed again. This year, the National Government issued the Mobilization Order for Suppressing the Rebellion, to proceed with taking over through military means. The people of the Northeast were extremely excited upon hearing this, and they supported the mobilization one after another, helping the army. The cooperation between the army and the people was excellent. He then recounted his feelings after presiding over the Northeast for the past two years, stating: There were originally no Communist Party members in the Northeast. Because the products were abundant, it can be said that every household was well-fed and clothed. Therefore, they were naturally unwelcome to the Communist Party. In addition, in the past two years, the Communist Party has destroyed industry and mines, scattering the people, which has made them even more disliked by the people. No matter how the Chinese Communists propagandize, it is ineffective. When a reporter asked about rumors of his new position, Xiong said that they were all unbelievable and that he urgently wanted to rest. A reporter said: After the Mobilization Order was issued, how could the director be allowed to rest? Xiong smiled and said: "Change of shift." Subsequently, Mr. Xiong answered reporters' questions, stating: (1) After Chief of Staff Chen arrived in Shenyang, because of the direct command relationship, military and political affairs have been unified. The rumor that Chief of Staff Chen shot more than ten military officers and several civil officials during his previous visit to Shenyang is not accurate. Only not long ago, I shot Ning Bao, the head of the Yingkou Inspection Office. (2) The so-called sixth offensive of the Communist army is propaganda. No such action has been seen yet. It is estimated that there are more than 500,000 Communist bandits in the Northeast. Currently, their main force is on the Shenyang-Hai, Jilin-Hai lines, and a part of the main force is in Tongliao. The Communist bandits' fifth offensive was the most fierce, and the losses were also the most significant. If they invade again, they will suffer the same fate. (3) There are indeed Korean Communists among the Communist bandits. There are such prisoners in Shenyang. We have discovered the axe-and-sickle flag among the Korean Communists, and have also seized Russian-style machine guns. (4) During the Anti-Japanese War, the Central Design Bureau's various plans for the Northeast, such as the division of provinces and regions, were generally correct. However, the destruction of the economy and transportation today is beyond expectations. We still advocate that the Northeast should build heavy industry, because the Northeast is the heart and lifeline of China.

[Special Dispatch from Our Shenyang Office, 6th] Before leaving Shenyang, Xiong Shihui donated hundreds of volumes of Song and Ming dynasty books he had collected to the Shenyang National Library.

### Chen Cheng Receives Representatives of Public Opinion; Discusses Ways to Revitalize Politics; Eliminates Corruption and Simplifies Administrative Organizations

[Special Dispatch from Our Pan Yang Office, 6th] Chen Cheng received representatives of public opinion organizations from Liaoning and Panjin at a tea party at 4:00 PM on the 6th. He expressed the ways to revitalize politics that should be followed: (1) Eliminate corruption and actively implement the Principle of People's Livelihood, so that corruption will naturally disappear, and passively deal with corrupt people. (2) Streamline administrative organizations and merge redundant agencies. Measures have been submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval. The administrative organizations of each province will strengthen their combat capabilities. Mr. Chen also stated: Accepting the opinions of all parties, the Northeast must not be special. With the Northeast's various superior conditions, it is the best experimental zone for implementing the Three Principles of the People. He is willing to work with the people of the Northeast to build a new Northeast based on the Three Principles of the People. The Northeast has been separated from the motherland for fourteen years, and there is a severe shortage of talents in all fields. He hopes to make every effort to complete the great plan of cultivating talents for a hundred years and sow good seeds for the new Northeast.

[Special Dispatch from Our Shenyang Office, 6th] On the 6th, Northeast public opinion groups presented to Director Chen four suggestions: streamlining Northeast agencies, rectifying military discipline, protecting the welfare of the local people, and revitalizing Northeast industry and commerce, as well as reporting on the general situation in the Northeast. Mr. Chen accepted various suggestions in the form of a symposium. At the meeting, he gave a comprehensive analysis of the Northeast's military, political, and economic situation, clarifying how he is determined to build it, which was warmly supported and welcomed. Regarding the issue of streamlining agencies, it has been decided to first streamline the Northeast takeover agencies. It is reported that the Northeast Enemy and Puppet Assets Unified Undertaking Reception Committee, the Northeast Production Administration, and the Northeast Real Estate Administration will be merged to form the Northeast Enemy and Puppet Undertakings Handling Bureau, with Wang Jiazhen serving as the director.

### Personnel Changes in the Northeast Headquarters

[Special Dispatch from Our Shenyang Office, 6th] Among those whose senior personnel appointments in the headquarters have been announced, in addition to Chu Xichun, Chief General Counselor of the Ministry of National Defense, concurrently serving as Deputy Director of the Headquarters Office, Peng Jiqun, Chairman of Nenjiang Province, has been appointed as Secretary-General. In addition, Peng Bisheng, Commander of the Shenyang Garrison, has been transferred to Taiwan as the commander of the 205th Division, and his vacancy will be filled by Li Minghao.

### Chen Mingren Summoned to the South

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 6th] General Chen Mingren, the defender of Siping, was summoned by the Chairman via telegram. He flew from Shenyang to Beiping at 6:00 PM today, and will transfer to a China National Aviation Corporation plane to Nanjing tomorrow.

### The Saying That Du Yuming Must Recover Before Taking on Military Responsibilities Again Is Inaccurate

[Report from Our Office] According to people close to General Du Yuming, Mr. Du's health has recently improved, but according to doctors' judgment, he still needs two months of treatment to get out of the medication stage. The longer the recovery time after that, the better. Therefore, the rumor that Mr. Du will reassume military responsibilities is purely speculative and not credible. Because Mr. Du is a soldier, he should obey the government's orders, but everything still depends on his health. In recent days, Mr. Du has rarely received guests, only meeting with a few friends such as Yan Zhuang.

### The Chairman Visits Datianshi

Picnics with Wang Lingji and others

[Central News Agency, Guling, 6th] Chairman Jiang and his wife visited Datianshi today and had a picnic there. Wang Lingji, Sen Jishi, and others were invited to participate. They did not return until 3:30 PM. There was heavy rain here at 4:00 PM, which stopped slightly at dusk. The autumn rain made it feel even cooler.

[Special Dispatch from Our Guling Office, 6th] Madame Chiang summoned Long Zhiqin, the wife of Hu Yibin, former Deputy Commander of the 96th Division of the Fifth Army, at 5:00 PM on the afternoon of the 6th. She expressed great concern for the livelihood of Hu's family after Hu died in action in Burma in the spring of the 31st year of the Republic, and promised to send a plane to Maitong to transport Hu's remains to Gan for burial.

### Salaries of Officers and Soldiers of All Units Have Been Issued According to the New Standards

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 6th] The Executive Yuan has decided to adjust the treatment of military personnel starting in August. In order to understand the situation of the funding and issuance of expenses for various units, the reporter specially visited the person in charge of the Joint Logistics Headquarters. According to him, the headquarters transferred military expenses one month in advance, and there was never any backlog of officers' and soldiers' salaries. Public miscellaneous expenses (i.e., recurring expenses) were all transferred to each supply area for distribution no later than the 20th of last month, and messy food and horse feed expenses were all transferred no later than the 15th of last month. For areas with military operations, transfers were made as early as possible. The order for the adjustment and granting of the August salary was issued on August 21. The headquarters has already transferred all the additional expenses for the adjustment and granting of the August-September salaries on August 28 according to the standards set by the Ministry of National Defense. As for the price of non-staple food and horse feed, due to the impact of rising prices, the original standards were insufficient. A request is being signed to increase them starting in September. The amount required for September was transferred as early as August 8, and the amount for October was also transferred on September 2. All units can contact the supply agencies in their respective areas to receive them.

### Reasons for Recent Price Fluctuations

[Special Dispatch from Our Nanjing Office, 6th] People close to the government said: Prices in various places have recently fluctuated slightly again. The main reason is the seasonal relationship, because prices will rise slightly every autumn. The government has paid attention to this and is planning effective countermeasures from the aspects of tightening credit and strengthening controls. In addition to seasonal factors, there are several reasons for rising prices: (1) The British pound has depreciated and cannot be exchanged for US dollars. Hot money from Hong Kong has moved north. (2) Hot money from Hankou and other places has concentrated in Shanghai due to the start of the war. The Chinese people had too much hope for Wedemeyer's visit to China, and prices once fell. This was an "extraordinary" phenomenon, which soon returned to normal. This factor may be a temporary phenomenon or a local phenomenon, and prices will soon return to stability.

### Bai Chongxi Visits Chicks

[Special Dispatch from Our Nanjing Office, 6th] Bai Chongxi visited General Chicks of the US Military Advisory Group at 10:00 AM on the 6th and talked for a long time.

### Wedemeyer Arrives in Honolulu to Draft Investigation Report

[Report from Our Office] Radio broadcast from San Francisco on the 7th: Wedemeyer arrived in Honolulu today and will concentrate on drafting the investigation report to be submitted to the US President in a summer camp on a small island in Hawaii. It is expected to be completed within five days. Before this, he will not meet with anyone.

### The Ambassador Delivers a Speech in Beiping; America's Position on China; The Purpose of Aid to China Is to Benefit the People

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 6th] Ambassador Stuart delivered a 20-minute speech at the Peking University Alumni Association welcome reception at 4:00 PM on the afternoon of the 6th, explaining the US policy and position on aid to China in detail. The ambassador said that the important international policy of the United States is to maintain world peace, so as to avoid a third world war due to differences in doctrines and interests, even if any country is not subjected to external military or political aggression. As for the US policy towards China, it has never changed, and the policy of aid to China has also not changed. However, aid to China is to benefit all the people of the country, that is, to aid the government supported by the people. This government must have patriotic, non-corrupt officials with status and achievements, who can leave a good impression on foreigners. The ambassador also said that the long-standing traditional friendship between China and the United States, if established on practical interests, will naturally be more consolidated, which is also of great importance to the world peace sought by the United States.

### Leaders of Shanghai Trade Unions Telegraph the United States Asking to Recognize the Crux of Our Situation; The Communist Party's Treason Is the Root of Disaster

[Central News Agency, This City] For the purpose of enabling the US government and the public to increase their understanding of the situation in our country, the leaders of the Shanghai labor community, in the name of the General Trade Union and the chairmen of various well-known trade unions, Shui Xiangyun, Zhou Xuexiang, etc., sent a telegram to President Truman and the authorities, making the following statement:

To President Truman, Secretary of State Marshall, and Members of Congress in Washington: We, in our capacity as persons in charge of the Shanghai Trade Unions, and in view of your country's deep concern for the situation in our country, would like to present our opinions as follows:

All of our country's citizens know that the root cause of all the crises and misfortunes facing our country today is the Communist Party issue. If there were no rebellion by the Communist Party, then our country's wounds from the war against Japan could have been mostly healed long ago, and all the difficulties and sufferings we are enduring today could have been avoided.

We hope that the people of your country will not be deceived by the Communist Party's democratic slogans. They believe that any anti-Communist claim is feudal and anti-democratic, but in the areas occupied by the Communist Party, there is absolutely no real freedom. On the contrary, what they use is cruel dictatorial means. Can real trade unions be established in areas ruled by the Communist Party? The answer is definitely "no."

We can take Hungary as an example, where a small number of Communist elements, using their powerful forces, have seized power.

Your country is working hard to prevent the spread of communist aggression in the world, and we have heard that your government is also in the process of purging Communist Party members and their sympathizers. We hope that your country will not think that our people are different from the people of other countries, and that the Chinese Communist Party is completely different from the Communist Parties in other parts of the world. Shui Xiangyun, Chairman of the Shanghai General Trade Union; Zhou Xuexiang, Chairman of the Huacheng Cigarette Factory Tea Workers' Union; Liang Yongzhang, Chairman of the American Telephone Company Union; Wang Zhenbai, Chairman of the Shanghai Postal Workers' Union; Ye Xianggao, Chairman of the Shanghai Steamboat Timber Workers' Union; Zhou Fujiang, Chairman of the British Waterworks Union; Zhang Ziheng, Chairman of the Shanghai Gas Union; Zhou Yunjiang, Chairman of the Huashang Water and Electricity Company Union; Lin Quting, Chairman of the Yong'an Cotton Mill Union; Weng Shanhe, Chairman of the Shenxin Cotton Mill Union; Zhang Ruihua, Chairman of the China Textile Company Textile Factory Union; Tang Guifen, Chairman of the Tongyi Cotton Mill Union; Zhang Wenlong, Chairman of the Hongzhang Cotton Mill Union; Zhang Shiling, Chairman of the Chongxin Textile Factory Union; Chuan Youkang, Chairman of the Shanghai Dyeing and Weaving Industry Union; Tang Shangyi, Chairman of the China Textile Company Woolen Mill Union; Ling Yingzhen, Chairman of the Shanghai Knitting Industry Union; Hong Meiquan, Chairman of the Yizhong Cigarette Factory Union; Tang Genbao, Chairman of the Nanyang Cigarette Factory Union; Hu Kun, Chairman of the Shanghai Printing Industry Union; Song Zhiming, Chairman of the Mobil Oil Factory Union; Tao Zhizhi, Chairman of the Texaco Oil Factory Union; Shu Jiazheng, Chairman of the Asiatic Petroleum Company Union; Pu Qingyi, Chairman of the Shanghai Dock Workers' Union; Feng Yahan, Chairman of the Shanghai Hotel Industry Union.

### Foreign Minister Wang Leaves Shanghai for the United States; The Fourth Plenary Session Will Review Foreign Policy; All Parties Hope the Government Will Adopt a Tough Foreign Policy

[Central News Agency, This City] Foreign Minister Wang Shijie, our chief representative to the Second General Assembly of the United Nations, along with his entourage Hu Qingyu, Zhang Yuanzhang, and others, left Shanghai for the United States on a Pan American Airways plane at 7:00 AM on the 6th. Those who went to the airport to see them off included Chen Guolian, Director of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Shanghai Office, Wei Jingmeng, Director of the Information Bureau's Shanghai Office, and more than ten others.

[Associated Press, Nanjing, 6th] Foreign Minister Wang Shijie's foreign policy was criticized at the Third Plenary Session last year, and at the Fourth Plenary Session this year, he will be attacked again for "kowtowing" to the United States and being weak towards the Soviet Union. The Fourth Plenary Session is scheduled to open on the 9th. There is now a movement that seems to want to gather strength among Kuomintang dignitaries to demand a thorough review of China's "kowtow" foreign policy. A reporter for the Associated Press, summarizing the opinions of various parties, found that the Kuomintang dignitaries' feelings towards Wang Shijie himself are becoming increasingly激昂. Several of them said that Wang's blind reliance on the United States and his fear of the Soviet Union have made China a sacrifice in world power politics. A certain Kuomintang dignitary said that occasionally demonstrating strength in diplomacy often yields results. The United States has adopted China's opinions twice. For example, the former head of the Chinese delegation to the Allied Control Council for Japan, Zhu Shuming, had disagreements with the United States on the allocation of tonnage for Japanese ships, insisted on his position, and finally succeeded. This is one example. Regarding the Sino-Soviet negotiations on the Northeast issue, Wang is accustomed to concealing the real reasons for the deadlock in the negotiations from the world. This point has particularly aroused the dissatisfaction of these Kuomintang members. An official said: "If the Soviet Union does not want to return Dalian and Lushun to China, it can let the whole world know."

### Explanations on Three Points Regarding Enterprise Group Elections

[Special Dispatch from Our Nanjing Office, 6th] Regarding the issue of exercising the right to vote in enterprise groups, the Election Headquarters recently explained several points as follows: (1) This election is a direct election. Occupational groups also vote through grassroots members, not by groups participating in the election. On the commercial group side, regardless of whether their members belong to the local chamber of commerce or the National Federation of Commercial Associations, the member representatives sent by each company, firm, or factory directly exercise the right to vote in accordance with the law. The detailed allocation method for how to participate in the two types of elections will be promulgated. (2) The creation of national representatives and legislators from liberal professional groups will also be determined in the detailed allocation plan. (3) The "national occupational group election" mentioned in the election laws and regulations refers to occupational groups that cannot allocate quotas by province or city and must divide districts for election or elect nationally, regardless of whether the group has a national organization.

### Chen Lifu Runs for Legislator, Requests Nomination from Zhejiang Provincial Party Headquarters

[Central News Agency, Hangzhou, 6th] Chen Lifu, the current Secretary-General of the Central Political Committee, whose ancestral home is Wuxing, Zhejiang, has decided to participate in the legislator election in the first district of Zhejiang Province. In accordance with the provisions of the implementation measures for Kuomintang members participating in elections, he has applied to the Zhejiang Provincial Party Headquarters yesterday for nomination as a candidate of our party.

### Strong People in Taiwan Province Still Lack Enthusiasm for Election

[Special Dispatch from Our Taipei Office, 2nd] According to the person in charge of the Taiwan Provincial Election Office, Taiwan has the most superior election foundation compared to other provinces. Each county, city, district, and township can complete the registration of more than 2.9 million voters within the limited period. This will begin the registration of people participating in the election immediately. He is confident that the people of Taiwan will be able to successfully complete the election steps. It is estimated that, in addition to some voters who are located in remote rural areas and cannot vote, and women, at least one-third will not give up their right to vote. However, he specifically emphasized that it is necessary to conduct powerful propaganda beforehand so that fair and powerful people who have lost interest in politics can restore their enthusiasm for election. Newspapers have repeatedly published election advertisements in recent days, and some have even been giving speeches everywhere in a persuasive manner for half a year, but their enthusiasm has obviously decreased, which is a cause for concern. According to one of the representatives participating in the legislator election, he absolutely does not want to see an election method of financial activity appear in the province. Only the income tax of the country where they are located.

### Income of Nationals Abroad

Only the income tax of the country where they are located

[Special Dispatch from Our Nanjing Office, 6th] Nationals who have a residence in the country, their income abroad, and the income of the head office or main office of a profit-seeking enterprise in the country from the operation of its branches and offices abroad shall be subject to income tax in accordance with Article 1 and Article 4 of the Implementing Rules of the current Income Tax Law. However, if this income has been taxed separately in accordance with the provisions of the income tax law of the country where it is located, in order to avoid double taxation, the Ministry of Finance has stipulated that the income tax already paid in accordance with the tax law of the country where the income is located, upon presentation of reliable evidence, shall be deducted separately from the total amount of the income tax payable, or application may be made to refund it to us, in order to show fairness.

### Supplementary Explanation of Election Procedures for National Assembly Representatives and Legislative Members

[Special Dispatch from Our Nanjing Office, 6th] Supplementary explanations on the procedures for handling elections by election offices at all levels for national representatives and legislators, which were drafted by the General Election Office last month, were submitted to the National Government for approval. The National Government has now formally issued an order for their promulgation. The full text is as follows:

### Inferior Quality and High Prices of Japanese Goods: Foreign Merchants Express Dissatisfaction; Liu Jusheng Appointed as Our Commercial Representative to Japan

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 6th] The first group of foreign commercial representatives to Japan, after staying in Japan for 21 days, have expressed considerable disappointment with the inferior quality and high prices of Japanese goods. The visiting merchants have now signed approximately 200 contracts; however, most buyers have expressed dissatisfaction with the high prices of Japanese goods. They believe that the prices of certain Japanese export goods are higher than the current world market prices, making large-scale purchases impossible. Furthermore, unless Japanese manufacturers make great efforts to improve their finished products, the label "Made in Japan" will remain a symbol of inferior goods. The visiting merchants are also dissatisfied with the small quantities of Japanese export goods. It is reported that before coming to Japan from the United States, they had received lists of Japanese goods available for purchase, but the quantities were not specified. Only after arriving in Japan did they discover that the quantities of certain goods were extremely small. The fact that the first group of visiting merchants has signed a large number of contracts with Japanese manufacturers indicates a recovery in Japanese trade, and although some merchants are dissatisfied, it is not a complete failure. About half of the first group of visiting merchants have applied to extend their stay, and it is expected that the second group will not be able to come to Japan in the near future. According to the Chinese delegation, they have not yet received the list of Chinese merchants who will be coming to Japan.

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 6th] Reports indicate that officials had denied the establishment of commercial representatives to Japan. When the reporter inquired about this with the spokesperson of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, they confirmed that the opening of trade with Japan this time is subject to strict regulations and is far from free trade. Therefore, the establishment of commercial representatives is indeed necessary. The candidate has been decided: Liu Jusheng, a member of our delegation to Japan, will be appointed, with Cui Wanqiu as his deputy. When the reporter inquired about the situation of public enterprises and private industrial and commercial sectors sending representatives, it was said that the method for public enterprises to send representatives might be revised, and the representatives from the industrial and commercial sectors have not yet been selected. The date of departure of the delegation is currently uncertain.

### Wan Can Discusses the Position on Drafting a Peace Treaty: Caution Against Japan's Comeback; Avoid Repeating the Mistakes of the Treaty of Versailles

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 6th] Wan Can, a supervisory committee member and reviewing committee member of the Foreign Ministry's Committee for the Review of the Peace Treaty with Japan, met with reporters on the 6th to discuss the points that should be strongly advocated when drafting the peace treaty with Japan. He stated: "Learn from the past to guide the future. Recalling the story of how the Treaty of Versailles failed to prevent Germany from making a comeback and learning from its lessons will be beneficial in drafting the peace treaty with Japan." The biggest shortcomings of the Treaty of Versailles were fivefold: (1) The destruction of Germany's armed forces was not thorough enough; (2) The dismantling of Germany's economic forces was not active enough; (3) Loans were given after reparations, and eventually, Germany was allowed to default entirely; (4) Regarding the territorial issue, only its overseas territories were dealt with, and no measures were taken regarding its homeland; (5) Re-education efforts were not fully implemented. Based on the above five points, we solemnly put forward the following demands. These opinions are what every Chinese person insists on and are necessary to prevent Japan from making a comeback to harm the world.

First and foremost, Japan's armed forces must be thoroughly and completely dismantled. Even police forces that can be trained into troops should be strictly restricted. The occupation of Japan should continue for a certain period until a truly democratic Japan emerges before withdrawal.

In terms of economy, Japan's losses are much lighter than China's, and its industry is almost entirely intact, making it possible to rise up and cause harm at any time. Regarding the basic policy of the Far Eastern Commission that "a non-war economy can be maintained," the scope and meaning of "non-war" should be strictly restricted. Anything that appears to be peacetime but actually has war significance should be included in the restrictions. Furthermore, MacArthur's suggestion that Japanese industry should be restored to the 1930-1934 level should also be revised, as the period around the September 18th Incident was when Japanese industry had the most solid foundation.

Regarding reparations, we must at least insist on Pauley's suggestion that China should receive 40 percent. In addition to obtaining compensation for war losses, we should also obtain compensation for the reconstruction of industry. Therefore, the reparations should mainly consist of production machinery.

Regarding the territorial issue, the Soviet Union only fought in the Far East for about a week, not only fully recovering its lost territories but even entering some new areas. We should strive to recover our lost territories, such as the Ryukyu Islands.

Finally, in terms of re-education, this point must be thoroughly achieved. Under MacArthur's rule, Japan appears to have no aggressive intentions, but remnants of the Minseito and Seiyukai parties still exist, secret groups are engaged in underground activities, and Mitsui and Mitsubishi are still operating in the shadows. Ozaki recently even published the absurd theory that Northeast China and Taiwan should vote for self-determination. All of this proves that Japan is far from democratic and that its aggressive ambitions have not yet been extinguished. Re-education work must be actively and thoroughly carried out. The trials of war criminals have been delayed, and recently some war criminals have been released for no reason, which is unacceptable.

Wan concluded by saying that the above points are not profound arguments, but they are indeed appeals unanimously put forward by the Chinese people after a long period of painful lessons. These points should be absolutely insisted upon when drafting the peace treaty.

[Associated Press, Washington, 6th] It is learned that the United States has decided to proceed with its plan to discuss the peace treaty with Japan with other Pacific-related countries, regardless of the Soviet Union's firm opposition. Some senior State Department officials believe that the only way is to first hold talks with the ten Pacific countries to decide on the date and location of the peace conference, and then invite the Soviet Union to participate.

[Associated Press, Hong Kong, 6th] Australian Foreign Minister Evatt, passing through here on his way to New York, said that the preliminary peace conference with Japan should be held before the UN General Assembly on September 16th.

### National Army in Southern Henan Continues Pursuit; Jingfu and Xuanhua Store Recaptured; Jie County at the Southern End of the Jintongpu Railway Recovered

[This Newspaper, Xuzhou, 6th] The National Army in southern Henan recovered Jingfu County on the afternoon of the 5th at 4:00 PM, annihilating over 500 bandits and capturing over 200. The 1st and 2nd Brigades of Liu's 1st Column and the 9th Brigade of the 3rd Column were all defeated and fled towards Macheng. Furthermore, the pursuing forces south of Luoshan recovered Xuanhua Store in one fell swoop on the 5th at noon. The remnants of Liu's 17th and 2nd Columns fled south. Currently, there are no bandit traces in the area north of Xuanhua Store. On the afternoon of the 6th, the National Army moving north from Huang'an and the National Army moving south from Jingfu joined forces near Qiliping and are now pointing east towards Macheng.

### The Path to Improving Chinese Characters

— Huang Ruozhou

Writing is a symbol for expressing language, used as a tool for enlightening knowledge, popularizing education, and developing culture. Therefore, a country's writing has a great influence on the people's lives and level of knowledge. Chinese characters are directly evolved from the ancient pictographic writing of our nation, with a long history and pure tradition. Since the Qin Dynasty implemented the policy of unifying writing, it has laid the foundation for national unity. For thousands of years, this populous country, although not everyone can read and write, has been directly and indirectly cultivated by writing. Even foreign nations such as Japan, Korea, and Annam have also been called "same writing". Although weak and repeatedly invaded by foreign races, it has eventually been assimilated by China, which shows that the dominant potential of cultural tradition exceeds any tangible political power. Chinese characters have made the greatest contribution to the cultivation, unification, and development of the Chinese nation, and have special characteristics that are far from comparable to other categories of culture. Political power must take cultural potential as its fundamental basis, and in the future path of nation-building, we must actively rebuild our Chinese culture.

Chinese characters evolved from knot-tying, image drawing, and hexagram drawing to oracle bone script, ancient seal script, lesser seal script, clerical script, eight-part script, and now regular script and cursive script. From the perspective of the evolution of the writing style, it is clearly revealed that from the beginning of the creation of characters to the modern era, in a broad sense, it has been improving at all times and in all places, but the pace of this improvement varies and the methods are different. The current War of Resistance is a great undertaking in the history of our country, and it is undoubtedly a major change of an era. Knowing the changes of ancient and modern writing, observing the past and discussing the present, one will not be confused. As for the future changes, they are vast and boundless, and I dare not speculate on them with my limited senses. However, based on the principle of human evolution and past facts, it proves that this complex Chinese character has problems when applied to modern society. Therefore, in recent years, many educators and literati in China have advocated the movement to improve Chinese characters. Some advocate adopting a revolutionary approach, while others advocate adopting an evolutionary approach. Each has its own opinion, and it is not easy to make a reasonable judgment. Currently, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization is holding its first basic education conference in Nanjing. In order to gather ideas, the Ministry of Education convened domestic experts to hold a preparatory meeting. Regarding the issue of Chinese character reform in language teaching, which is the most important part of basic education, there was a very heated debate. Some advocated that Chinese characters should not be changed, some suggested that Chinese characters must be improved, and some advocated abolishing Chinese characters and replacing them with Latinized or Romanized characters. At a time when reform is being advocated and there are many disputes, a slight deviation can lead to a great mistake. Building a nation must first build education, and basic education has an especially great impact. Hu Shi once said: "Regarding the issue of improving Chinese characters, I agree with gradual change and do not agree with abandoning Chinese characters in the shortest possible time. For example, if we completely adopt the national language Romanization, we must completely imprint the logic of Chinese characters into the national language Romanization before we can gradually take off the old robe and put on the new clothes. The so-called improvement is better than revolution." Originally, evolution should come from nature. The improvement of writing should gradually evolve with social culture, and it should not happen suddenly or disappear suddenly. Now, taking the history of Western writing reform as an example, Turkey adopted an active method, implementing new characters and abandoning old characters in the shortest possible time. France adopted a passive method, abolishing tens of thousands of characters each year and adding some new characters. However, according to China's national conditions, especially now that national consciousness is not yet firm and social order is unstable, it is not appropriate to imitate Turkey's approach. Once a nation has a deeply rooted culture, it is impossible to overthrow the old and establish the new. Even the most revolutionary Soviet Union, its modernization of writing still preserves its unique Slavic alphabet, with only slight modifications, and has not adopted the so-called international Roman alphabet of Europe and the United States, nor is there any need to do so.

Chinese characters have multiple pronunciations for one character, multiple characters with the same pronunciation, multiple meanings for one character, multiple characters with the same meaning, multiple forms for one character, numerous strokes, and each has its own historical tradition and unique usage, which is not only difficult for scholars to identify, but also difficult for teaching to convey its essence. This is the fundamental difficulty of Chinese character teaching, which makes it difficult to popularize education and enlighten the people. At this time when the country and society are oriented towards science, modernization, and modernization, Chinese characters must first be reorganized and improved in order to serve as a tool for eliminating illiteracy and achieving the task of popularizing education. Therefore, although we are aware of the close relationship between Chinese characters and our nation and should not abolish them, we hope that Chinese characters should be reorganized and improved as soon as possible. As for the method of improvement, it is most worthy of study. Otherwise, no matter how loud the improvement movement is, the society will still ignore it and cannot play any role. Therefore, the reform of Chinese characters should study and explore its path from all aspects, such as the nature of Chinese characters themselves, the limits of improvement, and the extent to which society can accept it. For example, advocating phonetic symbols is an improvement of the pronunciation of characters, and changing to colloquial writing is an improvement of the meaning of characters. These are all schemes for experts and scholars to seek improvement of Chinese characters. The limits of improvement have also been changed repeatedly in order to meet the needs. Over the past ten years, there have been significant results, but it is still necessary to actively promote it in order to achieve universal development and reach the ideal goal. Writing is nothing more than three aspects: shape, sound, and meaning. Chinese characters have already solved the difficulties in the sound and meaning aspects. At the present stage, only the shape of the characters remains a problem, but this point is more important than the above two points. Because square characters have many strokes and are really not easy to write, everyone dislikes the difficulty of writing, and wants to completely abolish Chinese characters. Therefore, if this point is not improved, it will affect the entire Chinese character problem. The shape of Chinese characters has become chaotic today. In addition to the usual standard characters, there are many non-standard deformed characters. The creation of this type of writing is of course due to the difficulty of the characters and the urgency of application. Therefore, although the unified regular script is taught in schools, students use this type of writing other than regular script, which results in the phenomenon of using what is not learned and learning what is not used. This type of writing naturally increases with the grade level. By the time they graduate from college, the calligraphy they use is similar to the katakana of Japanese. I remember when I was invited to speak on the issue of Chinese character writing at Guiyang Normal College in 1943, Xie Liuyi said in his introduction: "I cannot fully recognize the characters that the students usually copy. Many of them have to rely on a long time to imagine." Therefore, students today do not learn the characters that are taught, and teachers do not recognize the characters written by students. It is possible that they do not recognize yesterday's characters today, and the characters they write tomorrow are not today's characters. Everyone writes their own characters, and each place has its own characters, which makes the characters individual and local. Chinese dialects are complex, and all rely on writing to communicate. If there is no unified writing in the future, I don't know what will happen. If we continue to follow the old ways, I don't know where it will end. Nowadays, a group of young students only seek convenience in application, and have no idea of the evil consequences of destroying writing. This is of course an education problem, and we cannot neglect the trivial details and the initial stage, and we should quickly find a way to save this crisis. Otherwise, the impact on national rule and cultural progress will be even greater! Chinese characters have many strokes, and it is indeed difficult to apply them to writing, so we should strive to simplify them to meet the needs of the times. Before the war, the Ministry of Education issued a kind of commonly used simplified characters, but I don't know how it immediately withdrew its order. For more than ten years, all the calligraphy used in society has become more and more intensified, becoming simpler and simpler, complex and divergent, almost to the point of being uncontrollable. Therefore, domestic scholars have advocated simplified characters, and the Senate has also made this suggestion. Writing is a sharp tool for spreading culture and the external manifestation of the national spirit, and we must not allow it to continue to be chaotic. The authorities in charge of education and culture should follow the path of writing's nourishment, breeding, and proliferation, gradually evolving and transforming it, in accordance with the needs of language recording, and formulate a common and convenient writing style. Due to the society's subtle influence, the shape of the characters will gradually become simple and uniform, and the original complex characters and popular deformed characters will naturally disappear without a trace.

The creation of chaotic character shapes and the difficulty of writing is the only main reason. Therefore, if the writing problem is not solved, even if the character shapes are perfectly reorganized in the future, it will inevitably continue to be disturbed. Because the square-shaped regular script is really not suitable for writing. Every nation in the world has two types of writing: printed and handwritten. The printed type is square and upright, which is convenient for engraving; the handwritten type is round and flowing, which is suitable for writing. Even Japanese, which is accustomed to using Chinese characters, also has a type of writing. The two types of Chinese writing, printing and handwriting, are both regular script, and have been used unchanged since the Han Dynasty. However, in modern times, with complex personnel affairs and cultural progress, regular script has been found to be clumsy, and people mostly write in running script and cursive script. Those who cannot write in running script and cursive script replace them with simplified characters and deformed characters, which increase the efficiency several times compared to regular script. The creation of running script and cursive script in the Qin and Han Dynasties was originally for the benefit of writing and to meet the needs of the time. They have been used continuously throughout the dynasties, but in the imperial examination era, the world still mostly admired regular script. Since the Republic of China, running script and cursive script have begun to prevail, and now they have developed to the stage where elementary school students can recognize running script and cursive script, and middle school students mostly write running script. This is created by the social environment and is also a natural trend. At first, it did not rely on human encouragement or publicity to reach this point. The reason why it is popular throughout the country is purely created by the atmosphere, and systems, articles, and academic studies must all be influenced by the times. For the same reason, the calligraphy currently used in society can be said to be mainly running script. Unless there are legal regulations and the limitations of respecting accumulated habits, regular script must be used. However, since the advent of the Chinese typewriter, the role of regular script has become even smaller. Recently, Lin Yutang and others have transformed new, lightweight typewriters, and the application is becoming more and more simple, saving time and manpower, and it is an aid to broadcasting culture. The difficulty of writing regular script in the future can be solved by this. In the future, learning calligraphy in schools can reduce the practice of regular script, and it is sufficient to practice writing cursive script like English. The curriculum standards issued by the Ministry have long stipulated that calligraphy should first seek to be practical and be based on agility and accuracy, and should also practice writing running script and cursive script in addition to regular script. In recent years, there have been many people in China who advocate writing in running script and cursive script. Some advocate using running script, some advocate using cursive script, and some advocate changing to round script, but because they are not suitable or exceed the needs of society and the possibilities of the environment, they have not been widely used. Running script is slightly more fluent than regular script, and cursive script is more fluent and simple than running script. In practice, running script is still too complicated and cannot meet the demand. Cursive script is too simple, and the differences are not obvious, making recognition very difficult. We cannot increase the difficulty of recognition in order to make writing easier. Therefore, in order to meet the demand, we must first study the psychology of children and the masses learning, and we need to engage in sufficient time of experimentation. We should select commonly used and easy-to-recognize cursive script, as well as simple and easy-to-write running script, combine the strengths of both running script and cursive script to become a type of running cursive script, and then reorganize it with scientific methods. It can be analyzed and combined, has standards and a system, and becomes an easy-to-write, easy-to-recognize, easy-to-learn, simple, accurate, agile, practical, and common writing style. Running cursive can use one or two round and connected strokes to replace the square and straight strokes of twenty or thirty strokes, which is much simpler than any other writing style, saving time and effort, and its economy is unmatched. Moreover, there is not much difference between the shapes of regular script and running cursive script. The so-called cursive script has the true meaning. This point is better than other writing styles where the shapes of the printed type and the handwritten type are different.

After the running cursive becomes popular, it will become a type of Chinese handwritten writing. At that time, we will recognize regular script and write in running cursive, on par with the distinction between printed and handwritten writing in other countries. Once the writing problem is solved, the shape of the characters will not be difficult. The knot of Chinese characters currently being considered difficult is not in the recognition and explanation, but in the fact that the shape and writing are not easy. Now that running cursive can solve the difficulty of writing and the complexity of the shape, advocating running cursive calligraphy may not be a bright path to improve individual characters. All three aspects of Chinese characters, shape, sound, and meaning, have been improved, and Chinese characters have become easy to learn. However, it still depends on the active promotion of educators. Teaching methods are the most important key to learning. Those who obtain the method will learn easily, and those who do not obtain the method will learn with difficulty. There are many illiterate people in China, not because of the difficulty of the characters, but because the teaching of the characters has not obtained the method.

### Greek Political Situation Trending Towards Clarity; Coalition Cabinet Being Organized; Leader of the Liberal Party to Assume Premiership

[Athens, June 6 (Associated Press)] Sofoulis, leader of the Greek Liberal Party, declared on the 6th that he has completed the work of organizing a coalition cabinet to replace Tsaldaris' People's Party cabinet. He hopes the new government can be sworn in on Sunday. Tsaldaris will have a secret talk with Sofoulis on the 6th, then submit the resignation of his cabinet, which has been in office for only a week, to the palace so that King Paul can appoint Sofoulis as prime minister. Greek party leaders held intense consultations throughout the day. U.S. Ambassador Henderson occupied a crucial position in the discussions. The situation reached its climax with the announcement of the formation of the new cabinet. It is rumored that ultra-right elements within Tsaldaris' People's Party opposed forming a coalition cabinet with the Liberal Party, but their dissenting views were eventually dismissed. The main obstacle to the formation of a coalition cabinet a week ago was the inability of the parties to agree on which party should head the Ministry of the Army to carry out the campaign to eliminate guerrillas.

Further news: The work of forming a cabinet by the Greek political parties is nearing completion. It is expected that Sofoulis will serve as prime minister of the coalition cabinet. The ministers of public security and justice will belong to the Liberal Party, while the posts of deputy prime minister and foreign minister will be held by Tsaldaris.

### Vandenberg Expresses Views on Premature U.S. Aid to Europe, Strongly Advocates Prior Investigation of the European Situation

[Washington, June 5 (Reuters)] Senator Vandenberg, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, expressed his views tonight on the proposal for premature U.S. aid to Europe, stating that Congress cannot act in the dark, nor does it intend to issue any blank checks. The convening of a special session of Congress should be done by the President, and the President must also present facts to prove the necessity of convening a special session.

Vandenberg also tentatively set October 15 as the earliest date for the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to begin discussing the aid-to-Europe plan, as many members of the committee are still abroad and will not be able to return until then at the earliest. Vandenberg's statement proves that the Republican majority in both houses of Congress is unlikely to accept Deputy Secretary of State Lovett's suggestion to convene a congressional session prematurely to discuss a temporary emergency aid plan for Europe. Vandenberg also insisted that the government must provide facts about the European crisis and recommendations on how the United States should deal with these crises before Congress can take any action. Before Vandenberg made this statement, several other members of Congress had accused the State Department of fabricating the European crisis to achieve its political goals. Observers believe that before any temporary emergency aid to Europe is implemented, the State Department must do more preparatory work for Congress's actions.

### Amount of U.S. Economic Aid to Europe Must Decrease Annually

[Washington, June 6 (Associated Press)] It is reported that the United States will insist that any aid to European economic recovery must be based on a gradually decreasing plan, reaching zero by 1952. This point has been presented to the Paris conference drafting the needs for European aid. According to officials familiar with the plan, U.S. aid may be $6 billion in 1948, $5 billion in 1949, $4 billion in 1950, and $3 billion in 1951. It is also reported that no decision has yet been made on the matter of convening a special parliamentary session this autumn to discuss the aid-to-Europe plan. After the report from the Paris Conference arrives in Washington, Marshall will submit a proposal to the White House to convene a special session of Congress. The Paris report is expected to arrive around the 16th.

### "Life Magazine" Argues Strongly That the U.S. Should Actively Aid Britain

[New York, June 5 (Central News Agency)] Those in our country who feel deeply puzzled by the vast disparity between U.S. aid to Britain and aid to China can find another explanation in an editorial written by Luce, the publisher of "Life Magazine." Luce argued that the United States "must" give Britain aid and "must" save Britain from its current crisis because no one who reads news from Britain today can fail to respond with sympathy similar to that of the Blitz period. The article continued: If Britain cannot stem the Iron Curtain, then we will bear the responsibility ourselves, or allow the Soviet Union to expand into the power vacuum. When calculating the cost of aid to Britain, we should also calculate the cost of not aiding Britain. "Life Magazine" advocates that Truman convene a special session of Congress to inform them of the facts and extend the current loan before the Marshall Plan takes effect to save Britain. "Life Magazine" often holds a nationalist viewpoint, but on urgent issues facing American friends and allies, it holds an anti-communist view.

### Australia Sells Gold to Britain to Cope with British Crisis

[Canberra, June 5 (United Press)] Australian Prime Minister Chifley announced today that Australia has sold 150,000 ounces of gold to Britain to help it cope with the U.S. dollar shortage crisis. Chifley also stated that during the previous period of recession, Australia almost used all of its gold reserves to help Britain cope with foreign payments. In recent years, Australian banks have begun to replenish their gold reserves by purchasing gold from gold mines.

[London, June 5 (United Press)] Qualified sources in the Foreign Office declared today that Foreign Minister Bevin's suggestion that the United States redistribute the gold stored in Fort Knox to promote world economic recovery was entirely his personal idea and was rash, as it had not been carefully considered beforehand. The British government does not believe so. However, British and American officials said in talks on Thursday that Bevin's suggestion had the backing of the government.

### Travelers Landing in Britain Only Allowed to Carry Five Pounds

[New York, June 5 (Associated Press)] It has just been learned that passengers on the "Media" liner have received notification today that they will only be allowed to carry five British pounds in British banknotes when landing in Britain. This is an order issued by the British Embassy in the United States to the ship because there is a black market for British pounds in New York, so this measure has been taken.

### U.S. Coal Shipments to Britain Stopped

[Washington, June 5 (Reuters)] U.S. sources claim that Britain will not be able to obtain coal from the United States in the fourth quarter of this year. There are two reasons for the decision to stop shipments: (1) U.S. officials believe that Britain has abundant coal resources and no longer needs to rely on foreign countries; (2) British people, especially those in the coal mining industry, oppose the import of U.S. coal. Currently, the United States exports approximately four million tons of coal per month.

The revised regulations, negotiated by our Chargé d'Affaires in Australia, Zheng Kangqi, with Foreign Minister Evatt and Immigration Minister Calwell, came into effect on July 1, 1947. To express their gratitude for this revision, Chinese community leaders in New South Wales presented a bronze statue of President Chiang to the embassy in Canberra.

### French Cabinet Faces Economic Crisis; Drafts Emergency Measures Plan

[United Press, Paris, 5th] After Prime Minister Ramadier gained a vote of confidence in Parliament today, he and the relevant cabinet members drafted an economic emergency measures plan, and also drafted a European cooperation plan based on the Marshall Plan. Meanwhile, the Communist Party and the General Confederation of Labor have begun an opposition movement to the reduction in bread rations, and there are occasional worker protests in Paris.

### Various Countries Attach Importance to the Choice of President for the UN General Assembly

[United Press, Lake Success, 5th] The United Nations is looking for a world leader of integrity and impartiality to serve as the next President of the General Assembly. Initial contacts still involve competition between the two major camps of East and West. A UN official described the post of General Assembly President as the most difficult. Initial candidates included Australian Foreign Minister Evatt, Belgian Foreign Minister Spaak, Czech Foreign Minister Masaryk, and Brazilian Foreign Minister Aranha. However, more candidates are likely to emerge within two weeks. Evatt is opposed by the Soviet Union, but can gain the support of Western countries. The Soviet Union favors Masaryk, and several countries outside the Soviet Union may have no objections, but it is doubtful whether Western countries would be willing to entrust this important position to a country allied with the Soviet Union.

[United Press, Lake Success, 5th] According to reliable sources, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov will not attend the opening of the UN General Assembly, but may arrive later if deemed necessary. The Foreign Ministers of the other three countries, such as US Secretary of State Marshall, British Foreign Secretary Bevin, and French Foreign Minister Bidault, have agreed to arrive early, and will certainly be here by the opening of the General Assembly on September 16. However, there is a question about Bevin. The British delegation here has not been able to confirm that Bevin will definitely attend, or whether it depends on Molotov's actions. UN observers say that the issues to be discussed by the General Assembly are of great importance to the Soviet Union, and Molotov will definitely attend during the meeting.

### Night Express to Beijing Frightened En Route; Cry for Help from Boy Falling into Water Causes Misunderstanding; Intense Gunfire Causes Train to Be Stopped

[Our Reporter] At 1:00 AM yesterday, the second train on the Beijing-Shanghai line (the night express that departed from Shanghai to Beijing at 11:00 PM the night before) was heading towards Wangting Station after passing Suzhou Station when the driver saw a roadside policeman in the dim moonlight using a lantern to signal the train to stop. After the driver braked, the policeman shouted, "A fight is happening between Wangting and Zhoujingxiang! The train cannot proceed!" He also said that he had heard intense machine gun fire. The 12th train stopped there temporarily upon hearing the warning and immediately notified the Shanghai Police Department by emergency phone. The duty officer, upon receiving the report, realized the seriousness of the situation and immediately summoned the duty police officers and drove a armored vehicle to the scene. When they arrived at Wangting Station, they did hear explosions in the distance. The policemen abandoned their vehicle and proceeded on foot, following the sound.

Cai Xintao, Chairman of the Fourth District Silk Weaving Industry Association, immediately went to the Social Affairs Bureau in the afternoon with the factory owners to meet with Director Wu to report the situation, claiming that dozens of factories were on strike.

He also stated that since the announcement of the measures by the Labor-Management Evaluation Committee, employees of some silk weaving factories in Puxi felt that there was no discount for those earning less than 30 yuan, but a 10% discount was applied to the entire amount for those earning over 30 yuan, resulting in lower income than those earning 30 yuan. Therefore, they would automatically stop working once they earned the base salary of 30 yuan, which has significantly affected production. Both labor and management believe that these measures are unreasonable. Director Wu explained in detail and instructed them to submit a written report for further study after reconvening both parties. He immediately instructed the Labor Department to summon the union leaders to the bureau for talks and ordered them to resume work immediately. According to the union, only four or five factories were on strike, not as many as the management claimed. It is also reported that the Social Affairs Bureau has learned that the current labor unrest was instigated by the "Guangfu Society" and is considering appropriate measures to deal with it.

### Senators Inspect Police Stations, Generally Recognize Low Pay for Officers

[Report from Our Newspaper] City Council Police Affairs Committee Senators Zhang Jiu-zuo, Zhang Yi-qu, and others, yesterday morning continued their inspection of the Huangpu, Water Police, Songshan, Lujiawan, and Changshu branch stations. In the afternoon, they inspected the Lao Zha, Xincheng, Jing'an, and Changning branch stations.

As a result of the inspection by the senators, the more specific problems were roughly divided into two categories: (A) General: (1) All branch stations felt that the officers' pay was too low and that efforts should be made to provide relief. (2) The police vehicles used for urgent cases such as catching thieves at each branch were dilapidated and in urgent need of improvement. (B) Specific: (1) The trend of unauthorized construction is very prevalent. Branch stations such as Yulin Road, Yangshupu, Lujiawan, and Changshu all felt it was difficult to handle. (2) It is not easy for punishments to be effective in cases of children snatching cotton. (3) The lack of traffic lights makes traffic control difficult and vehicles are prone to accidents. The Yulin Road branch station has this difficulty. (4) It is easy for refugees sleeping in the open to transfer to banditry. Branch stations such as North Station, Zhabei, Xincheng, and Jing'an all have this situation. (5) The police bell equipment used for blockades is a legacy of the Japanese enemy and can be used for retrofitting. (6) The Lao Zha branch station and other jurisdictions are particularly lively, and there are particularly many cases of violations of the law. The officers handle them day and night, feeling very hard-pressed, and should be given spiritual encouragement by the citizens. (7) Excrement trucks still pass on the road between 10:00 and 11:00 a.m., which hinders public health. This phenomenon exists in the Changning branch station.

### Plenary Session of the Senate Nears; Many Proposals Have Been Received

(3) Proposed by Gu Bao-yu, Pan Jie-mei, and two others, to continue to request the widespread establishment of low-priced rice distribution points to implement grain distribution based on population to ensure social stability. (4) Proposed by Gu Bao-yu, Pan Jie-mei, and two others, to improve the quality of volunteer inspectors and volunteer police and prohibit the indiscriminate carrying of firearms to maintain social security.

### Shanghai Has Not Yet Received Orders to Ban Dance Halls by the End of September

[Report from Our Newspaper] It was reported that the Executive Yuan's Political Affairs Conference passed a regulation requiring all dance halls in all regions to be banned by the end of September. According to Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday, the city has not yet received a central ban on dance orders. The official implementation will be discussed after the order arrives. As reported, no matter what the consequences, the order will be implemented. Even if the central order arrives on the 29th, it can be banned on the 30th. However, if you want to solve everything, it may not be easy to do so. Director Wu claimed that Mayor Wu had just spoken to President Zhang on the phone a few days ago, and President Zhang told him about the implementation measures for the dance ban.

### Blood Case on Anfu Road: Executive Yuan Staff Member Stabs Old Woman

[Report from Our Newspaper] Quan Xuchang, a 28-year-old from Beiping, is a clerk in the Transportation Section of the Executive Yuan. His father, Quan Mao-chen, who is over sixty years old, used to hold an important position in the enemy puppet organization. When victory came, he retired and obtained a pension and a large amount of materials, but he did not hand them over to his family and gave them all to his concubine, Zhao Fang, for safekeeping. Zhao is already in her fifties and lives at No. 5, Lane 120, Anfu Road. Later, Quan's father felt that he had lost his reputation and was afraid of being held accountable, so he hid elsewhere. Zhao secretly embezzled all the property. At 8:30 p.m. the night before last, Quan Xuchang went to Zhao alone to settle his father's property. Unexpectedly, Zhao flatly refused. In a fit of anger, Quan developed a murderous intent and stabbed Zhao in the chest with a sharp blade more than a foot long, and injured her hands in four places. Zhao screamed in pain and fell to the ground. By the time the servants arrived, Quan had fled without a trace. Zhao was sent to the Red Cross Hospital for treatment. Because of her serious injuries, she is unlikely to survive. The police branch station in charge is currently tracking down the murderer.

### Countless Out-of-School Youths Are Eagerly Awaiting; Hoping That Kind People Will Extend a Helping Hand

In the past few days, we have received many letters from readers. In these letters, there are painful appeals, stern criticisms (of the rich and unkind), and valuable suggestions. Of course, the newspaper's space does not allow us to publish every letter, and we do not have the manpower to reply to every letter, but one thing that we have always strictly adhered to is to humbly accept every valuable suggestion.

Yesterday, we received a letter signed by more than 40 poor students. They did not indicate the school they were studying at or write down their contact address, but their words revealed unparalleled enthusiasm. They said, "Dear Editor: Your 'Restoring the Old Scholarship Fund' has been raising donations for two weeks. Although many enthusiastic benefactors have generously donated, it is still too far from the ideal state. Some of us young people have dropped out of school, and some are about to drop out of school. In a nutshell, we need people's help to complete our studies. Now we would like to make a suggestion to you: every generous benefactor should be given special praise, so that, on the one hand, people can be encouraged to do good deeds, and on the other hand, poor young people can have the opportunity to be respected and admired. We hope that this opinion can be adopted by you..."

After receiving this letter, we immediately submitted it to the "Reader Scholarship Committee." After careful discussion of this proposal, the following resolution was made:

"Those who donate more than 5 million yuan to the scholarship fund will be praised by the newspaper and a recent photo of the donor will be published on the local edition to show our admiration."

Now countless poor young people are eagerly looking forward and waiting eagerly. For their studies and for their future, we hope that enthusiastic people will give them timely assistance as soon as possible!

### A French Concession Tramway Line Is Shut Down Due to a Conflict Between a Ticket Seller and a Fruit Vendor; A Mob Fight Injures Four

[Report from Our Newspaper] At 7:50 a.m. yesterday, a French Concession Route 1 tramway, F27, was arriving at the 16th Wharf terminus from Xiafei Road, Fukaicheng Road. A fruit vendor named Chen Genfa insisted on getting on the train at the station and had a fight with Chen Rongfu, the ticket seller of the train, No. 661. The tram driver, the trackman, the ticket seller, and more than ten fruit vendors of the same profession as Chen Genfa came out to help each other, and the fight escalated. The Yimiao Police Branch Station in charge received the news, and Branch Chief Shen Deheng personally led police officers to the 16th Wharf to suppress the situation. They took many people, including the water and vegetable vendors who caused the incident and the tramway ticket sellers, to the station for questioning. Ticket seller Chen Rongfu, trackman Qu Xizhong No. 33, fruit vendor Chen Genfa, Sun Jiaxiang, and others were injured and sent to Renji Hospital. They were all discharged after being bandaged. After the incident, French Concession tramways Nos. 1, 2, 4, 7, and 10 were all suspended to protest. The company and the union sent representatives to the Yimiao Branch Station to negotiate. The authorities advised the union representatives to immediately find a way to restore the operation of the tramways on all routes, and not to hinder public transportation because of small incidents. The police station also persuaded both sides to reconcile. At noon, the reconciliation was reached, and tramways on all routes resumed operation at 12:45.

### The Yu Case Was Tried for Half a Day Last Saturday; Police Technician Testified in Court; Bloodstains on Woolen Pants Were Confirmed to Be Human Blood

[Report from Our Newspaper] The U.S. Military Court continued to be in session yesterday, summoning many witnesses. Since yesterday was the weekend, there was no court session in the afternoon. At 9 a.m., the first witness was U.S. Investigator Hua Luoshi. Hua said that on August 1, he met Ma Lai at the Broadway Building. After the blood case occurred, on August 3, he was ordered to search Ma Lai's bedroom. He found a pistol and a pair of brown woolen pants with bloodstains in his bookcase. The physical evidence was presented to the court for inspection by the prosecutor, the judge, and the defendant's defense attorney. After Hua left the court, Zhao Xianzhang, a technician from the Criminal Division of the Police Department, was summoned. Zhao listed the inspection process, saying that the bloodstains on the brown woolen pants were tested with rabbit anti-human blood serum precipitation, which proved that they were indeed human blood, and the comparison test was accurate. The dried bloodstains on the back seat of the car were also the same. Xu Guoji, a staff member of the Detective Division of the Police Department, stated that he went to the inspection with Zhao Xianzhang, and his testimony was the same. The court then summoned another witness, Mrs. Xie Huiwen, who testified that on the evening of August 1, Queli had accompanied a foreigner of smaller stature to her home to visit her husband, but failed to meet him and left. The court then summoned Xie Zhengyi, who knew Queli. Xie said that he had only known Queli for a few days. On the evening of August 1, he was in the catering department of the racecourse when Queli suddenly came in a hurry at about 7:30 p.m. and asked him to exchange gold bars for U.S. dollars, but he did not succeed because it was too late. Queli visited again at noon on August 2, saying that he had a friend returning to the United States who needed U.S. dollars and asked him to find a way to help. He immediately wrote an introduction note and instructed him to contact another friend. He never saw Queli again after that. Finally, Gao Meiying, a waitress at the Baixuelong Bar on Zhubaosan Road, was summoned. According to her testimony, she was very familiar with Ma Lai. Ma often came to drink. Before and after the case, Ma Lai did not show any signs of unease. The questioning was over at this point, and it was past 12 o'clock. The court ordered the trial to continue at 9 a.m. tomorrow.

### The Background of the Labor Dispute at the Da Zhonghua Paper Mill Is Complicated; Mediation Has Been Temporarily Suspended

[Report from Our Newspaper] The labor dispute over the dismissal of workers at the Da Zhonghua Paper Mill in Wusong was convened by the Social Affairs Bureau on the 5th for negotiations between labor and management, but no agreement was reached. The bureau believed that the workers had a complicated background and were manipulated by someone, so it temporarily suspended mediation. Now the factory has allowed the second batch of twelve people to be dismissed to first take a month's leave with full pay and wait for them to reflect. After one month, they will be allowed to return to the factory to work. The first batch of sixteen dismissed people accepted the Social Affairs Bureau's suggestion to hire six people, and the remaining 20 were legally dismissed and paid dismissal money. The workers still disagree with this, but four of them have voluntarily collected their dismissal money from the factory.

The Factory Releases the Details

The person in charge of the factory said that the workers who were to be dismissed this time were all temporary carriers who incited the workers in the factory to strike. One morning, Wu Kun and other temporary workers who had not been dismissed forced the workers to stop working in the hope of achieving the purpose of the strike. On the morning of the 2nd, the workers threatened the employees in the factory to go slow. During the chaos, Huang Chuandi, a dismissed worker, accidentally slipped down the escalator while closing the motor and scratched his leg. He falsely accused the official in charge of the motor of stabbing him with a sharp knife. When the dismissed workers caused trouble, the police station took four ringleaders back to the police station. After filling out a letter of repentance, they were released immediately. The so-called arrest of eight people never happened.

### The Trial of Li Mingyu, a Pseudo-Legislator, Continues; He Shizhen Testifies in Court; He Was Once Ordered to Engage in Intelligence Work

[Report from Our Newspaper] The trial of Li Shiyu, a suspect in the traitor case who served in the pseudo-organization, continued in the High Court yesterday afternoon. Li presented three witnesses, Dong Lingge, He Shizhen, and others. Dong and He both testified in court yesterday. First, Dong Lingge testified that he is currently working for the Yanxing Bank. He has known Li Shiyu for many years. He was responsible for the office of the International Research Institute in Hong Kong, and Li also worked in the International Research Institute. After the outbreak of the Soviet-German War, the Hong Kong office closed. After that, his contact with Li was interrupted, but he heard that Li was under the command of Li Guangtian in the north and Zhu Jinghua in the south. Later, He Shizhen testified that he is a lawyer and engaged in underground work during the Anti-Japanese War. He served as a senior consultant to the International Research Institute. Li Shiyu was introduced to him by Li Wenzhi, director of political training at the pseudo-Security Command's Cadre Training Corps. After that, he was under his command and engaged in intelligence work. He reported to him in advance that he would serve as a pseudo-legislator, chief of the secretariat of the pseudo-Security Command, chief of the military law office, and chief of the judicial office of the pseudo-Shanghai Police Department, and he agreed. After that, he and Li Wen planned a plan to cooperate with the National Army's counterattack, which was submitted to the Third War Zone, but unfortunately, the plan could not be realized due to the arrival of victory.

### Autumn Scenery of Kuling: Chairman's Residence, Rich in Artistic Atmosphere; Mountain Road Construction Plan Shelved

[Special Dispatch from Kuling, September 4th] The portrait of the head of state at the beginning of Hedong Road has now been repainted by Fu Tingyan, with the same size and appearance as before, but the demeanor of the head of state is even more serene and dignified, making pedestrians feel a sense of reverence. It is heard that Mr. Fu has recently painted a medium-sized oil painting of the head of state as a commemoration of his visit to the mountains this summer. (Note: Mr. Fu became famous last summer for painting portraits of the head of state and his wife, as well as Marshal Ma, while in the mountains).

Artist Fu Tingyan's recent masterpieces on the mountain also include Bai Yingdong's Penglai Pavilion, Xiu Feng Temple's Mawei Spring, Haihui Temple, Guanyin Bridge, Five Old Peaks, Qingyu Gorge, the gate of Xiu Feng Temple, and the mountain gate of Guizong Temple. These small watercolor paintings were framed by Jiangxi Chairman Wang Lingji yesterday (September 3rd) and respectfully presented to the head of state, becoming one of the decorations for the existing official residence.

Yuan Liuxin, the director of the Third Department of the Lizi Society and one of the famous painters in the country, has recently been on the mountain with great enthusiasm for painting. He personally went to Hanpokou and other places to sketch, and has now produced several medium-sized oil paintings. After the head of state and his wife visited the mountain, the autumn scenery of Lushan became even more magnificent. However, the streets of Kuling, recovering from the calamity, have once again seen rising prices. The price of rice, which was 170,000 yuan per picul a week ago, has now soared to the 250,000 yuan mark, a jump of 50,000 yuan compared to Nanchang. The price of a meal in restaurants has also increased by 3,000 yuan per serving, totaling 11,000 yuan.

This year, various places have suffered from extreme heat, and Lushan, a popular summer resort, is no exception. During the hottest days a few days ago, the indoor temperature rose to 84 degrees Fahrenheit, and it still remained around 75 degrees Fahrenheit until noon today. According to an "old Lushan resident," this year is the hottest in nearly 70 years. In this season of heat waves, Lushan deeply feels the depletion of water resources. Apart from a few streets and residential areas with tap water, most mountain residents have to fetch water from distant places. Even the water source for the head of state's residence on Hedong Road is running low, requiring daily pumping with machinery, keeping the machinists and stewards extremely busy.

The Kuling urban area, after the great fire, is on the road to recovery thanks to the efforts of the management bureau. However, in today's "difficult economic times," all construction on Lushan is hindered by this factor. The tragic scene of the fire site at the new intersection of the urban area still exists. The main street of the bustling urban area, apart from a few shops with relatively impressive architectural scale, is still filled with temporary shops built with dilapidated walls, standing side by side. However, the width of the roads has indeed been widened, giving people who come to Kuling the impression that the foundation for the construction of a new Kuling has been laid here.

The electrical equipment in Kuling is indeed more complete than last year, with ubiquitous and bright electric lights, clear and convenient telephones, and quickly transmitted telegrams, truly worthy of being called the equipment of a new city. An ordinary commercial telegram sent from the mountain can reach the recipient in just one hour, demonstrating the speed and efficiency.

After the head of state's visit to the mountain this time, he expressed that Lushan is a tourist area and should not have cars or "honking" horns. The construction of "mountain roads" may be shelved. The Management Bureau and the Provincial Highway Bureau are currently reconsidering this matter.

The first draft of the "Continuation of the Lushan Chronicle," compiled by veteran revolutionary journalist Wu Zongci, has now been completed. Mr. Wu sent two copies. Director Wu Shih-han presented one copy to the head of state yesterday (September 3rd) and stored the other in the library for public viewing.

### Chen Bulei's Appraisal of Cloud and Mist Tea

[Special Dispatch from Kuling, September 4th] The Lushan Management Bureau's forestry farm harvested more than 30 catties of Yunwu tea this year. The bureau specially prepared beautifully decorated paper boxes and packed them into several boxes. These have been transferred by Jiangxi Chairman Wang Lingji to important central officials on the mountain. Twenty boxes will be offered to the chairman and his wife. It is reported that Central Committee member Chen Bulei tried this year's new Yunwu tea on the mountain and believed it to be the only famous tea in China, with an incomparably clear and fragrant taste. Even after five infusions, it is still palatable. The bureau plans to expand planting next year to increase production. (Reporter Liu Zao)

### Wuxian County's Troop慰勞 Movement: Preparing for Active Expansion

### Unemployed Vagrants in Qingpu: Three Ordered to Be Conscripted; Conflicts Occur in Chenfang Town for Several Days; Rioters Seek Trouble with Bao Chiefs; School 核銷 Destroyed, Staff Kidnapped

[Special Dispatch from Qingpu, September 5th] The Qingpu County Government recently ordered the conscription of unemployed vagrants in the county, who will be sent to the province for training and then dispatched to northern Jiangsu to engage in suppression work. Chenfang Town in the county has already sent three unemployed vagrants to the county for transfer to the province for conscription. Unexpectedly, a few days ago, 40 to 50 miners from Chenshan Township, holding the local Bao Chief, swarmed into the town, claiming that two of the three conscripted people were miners from the mountain and must be retrieved before they would stop. The Town Office said that the two had no household registration and could not prove whether they were workers, and had already been sent to the province, so it was difficult to retrieve them. After a stalemate for a while, the two sides clashed. The miners then started to destroy the National School in the town and forcibly kidnapped the staff in the Town Office to the west. The Town Self-Defense Force was aware of the incident and immediately joined the police station personnel to pursue them, firing more than 100 shots. For a time, the order in the town was disrupted and people were panic-stricken. Finally, the kidnapped personnel were rescued from danger and the rioting workers fled westward. The next morning, more than 100 miners, armed with iron rulers and short sticks, came to the town to cause trouble. Fortunately, the county government learned of the incident and urgently dispatched a large number of military police to go to the countryside to suppress them, avoiding a bloody incident. The situation is still at a stalemate.

### New Filial Murder Report: Lanxi Stepmother Poisons; Zheng Fukun Assists in the Abuse; Forcing a Four-Year-Old Son to Swallow Eel to Death

[Special Dispatch from Lanxi, September 3rd] Recently, the tea houses and restaurants in the county have been talking about a shocking news: the deceased, named Ji Sheng, was a male, only four years old, from Xinqiao, Dannan Township, in this county. Ji Sheng's father, Zheng Fukun, is 42 years old and has married four wives. The first wife had no children and was returned to her mother's home. The second wife bore two sons, the eldest of whom is already ten years old. Later, the second wife died of illness. Zheng remarried to a Miss Fan, who bore Ji Sheng. Before long the couple's relationship fell apart and was dissolved through court. Ji Sheng was given into the care of the mother, Fan, with Zheng Fukun paying 500 kg of grains annually in two installments (February and August) for upkeep of his son. He was also to give him a set of clothes yearly. A written agreement was signed. Afterward, Zheng Fukun did not keep his promise, and Fan married a man named So-and-so in Bajiaojing, Sanfeng Township. Ji Sheng was then sent back to Zheng Fukun. In November, year 33, Zheng Fukun took a fourth wife, Tang, from Tang Village, Zhuge Township. She gave birth to one son. However, Zheng Tang listened to a fortune teller, "Someone will surely die in your family, otherwise your son will not live long." Therefore, Tang had murderous intentions towards Ji Sheng, beating him and abusing him by every means possible. On the evening of the sixteenth day of the sixth lunar month of this year, Tang went to the extreme and tied Ji Sheng's hands. She then shoved a large eel into Ji Sheng's mouth, snipping off the eel's tail. The eel, in extreme pain, burrowed into Ji Sheng's abdomen. Ji Sheng was thus murdered alive, squirming in agony. Ji Sheng's father stood by and assisted in the act of abuse. Ji Sheng's 10-year-old elder brother witnessed the scene, but was cowed into silence. Zheng Tang used the method of the "swallowing a snake" to stage a "new filial murder." To cover up the crime, she placed Ji Sheng's corpse in a vat that night and threw it into a nearby ditch while people were unprepared the next day. On the 17th night, amid thunder and lightning, Zheng Tang and others, fearing divine punishment, pretended the next morning that Ji Sheng had died suddenly by saying they'd discovered the corpse while pouring away facial wash water. Neighbors heard the commotion and rushed to view the scene, but didn't interfere knowing the circumstances. Zheng Tang threw the corpse in a pond as to ensure there would be no more problems. Unexpectedly, the eldest son of Zheng Fukun spoke of the matter, giving an account of the matter. Throughout Lanxi, singers and storytellers have composed folk melodies telling the tale.

Pitiful Ji Sheng's mother, Fan, learned about the death five days ago, that he'd died so miserably. She then travelled to the city and appealed to the Lanxi District Court Prosecutor's Office on the 30th, demanding she be vindicated. It is now heard that the court has issued an arrest warrant for Zheng Tang to be brought in for questioning.

### Tungsten Ore in Dongyang is Easily Found: Ore Left On the Ground Deserves Attention

[Special Dispatch from Dongyang, September 4th] The tungsten ore in Dongyang, a neighboring county of Jinhua, is produced on the back of Dalong Mountain in the county, about 70 li from the city and 20 li from Weishan Town. The area is mountainous, and tungsten ore is found everywhere, with some places already exposed on the ground and easily accessible. (Note: Tungsten ore, scientific name Graphite, is a crystalline carbon, with the largest production in places like Ceylon. It is not very hard, grayish, and has luster. It is commonly used to make pencil leads, and has various other industrial uses, such as making steel crucibles, machine lubricants, and rust inhibitors for ironware.)

The tungsten ore on the back of Dalong Mountain has been discovered for many years, but mining and management only began after Dongyang fell, from 1942 to 1945. During the period when the enemy occupied the area, the enemy and puppets tried to seize the mining rights by force. However, after our self-defense forces defended it to the death and fought the enemy, the enemy and puppets still failed to get involved and left after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War.

This tungsten ore, commonly known as "shanmo" (mountain ink), is even more precious to the people of Dongyang because the blood of self-defense has been shed to protect it. However, limited by manpower and financial resources, large-scale mining and transportation cannot be carried out. Now, the mining area is already deserted, with only a few villagers occasionally mining small quantities using native methods, but the number is very small. This deserves the attention of the government. People generally hope that the government can use its power to mine using new methods, so that the ore will not be abandoned on the ground and unattended.

Representatives from various units attended almost in full. The First Group, General Administration Group, which was originally scheduled to be held at the same time, did not take place. The meeting was chaired by Mr. Pattoni of New Zealand. After the meeting, he first announced that Mao Genye, the representative of Hong Kong, had reported and immediately attended the subgroup meeting. Then, Qu Junnong, the representative of China, reported on the work done by the preparatory committee on content and teaching materials. The representative of India, Mr. Yi Ding, proposed that teaching materials should pay attention to the inculcation of international ideas to eliminate war. Dickson, the representative of Sarawak, believed that even the Soviet Union, which valued internationalism, could not avoid fighting Germany, and international ideas may not be enough to eliminate war. Mr. Sardan stated that his so-called international ideas are not internationalism, but the world philosophy of "all under heaven are one family." Then, they studied the discussion outline provided by the preparatory committee for reference, and expanded all the principles mentioned in the outline that specifically referred to China to be general. The main purpose is that the content of teaching materials should focus on eliminating national and racial prejudices and barriers. Each country should re-examine its basic education materials and may request technical assistance from UNESCO. In addition, it was also passed that children's textbooks should focus on arousing interest and matching their intellectual development. Adult textbooks should focus on their specific needs and important principles such as daily life. When the discussion reached the issue of teaching material language, opinions were quite divided. The original opinion put forward by our side was the simultaneous teaching of the national language and minority languages. Sarawak and others believed that the national language should be the main language. Mr. Louis, the representative of UNESCO, then stood up and reported the decision of the UNESCO Language Group: Basic education should start from the original language (Mother Tongue) of the residents of the local area. Finally, when the vote was taken, most of the entire countries agreed with the UNESCO opinion. Only Sarawak expressed opposition, while Singapore and Hong Kong declared abstention. The meeting adjourned at 12:30 p.m. All representatives departed to visit.

In the afternoon, all the representatives set off to visit at 2:30 p.m. First, they went to Gulou Kindergarten and the attached first and second grades of primary school.

Then, they went to the First District Central National School of Zhujiang Road. Ms. Lu Guizhu, the acting principal, reported on the school's general situation. After an 11-year-old girl delivered a welcome speech, they visited the misspelling test performance in the junior class and the reading test performance in the senior class, and studied them in detail. Finally, they went to the attached primary school of the Central University Teachers College in Dashiqiao. Mr. Wu Youxun, the president of the Central University, personally welcomed the representatives to the kindergarten section for a short rest, and gave a speech with the words "Warm Welcome and Heartfelt Thanks." Then, Dean Luo Tingguang introduced the situation of the departments of the Central University Teachers College, and Director Dian Zhenqing reported that the attached primary school was occupied by the Japanese as a club during the war, the school building was destroyed, and the losses were great. Now, reconstruction is underway. There are now 906 students, and the teaching method generally emphasizes experimentation. Then, they began to visit the various experimental equipment in the junior classrooms, which were of particular interest. Mr. Jia, the representative of India, and Mr. Nelson, the representative of Singapore, also participated in the student tug-of-war game. Director Lei also invited the representatives to be divided into five groups to talk to the students in the fifth and sixth grade classrooms, and answered questions, explaining the students' knowledge of various regions.

The students expressed their concern for the students of the same grade in various places, and asked the representatives to take letters of greeting. Finally, after receiving tea and snacks, they left.

[United Press, London, 5th] A member of the British World Games Organizing Committee said today that Britain is continuing to prepare for the 1948 World Games as usual. The criticisms in the Evening News editorial, that the Chicago World Games Committee advocates changing the venue, will be ignored. The Evening News agreed with the Chicago proposal, saying that Britain, in its current economic state, cannot afford the labor and money required to host the event, and asked that the preparations be handed over to another country. However, the British Committee reiterated today that Britain is fully capable of preparing for the World Games, and foreign athletes will be warmly welcomed. An editorial in the London Star also refuted the proposal to cancel the World Games, saying, "Let the World Games take place. It will benefit Britain's dignity for thousands of athletes from all over the world to come here. Athletes are better envoys of mutual understanding than professional peace envoys. Canceling the World Games at this time would be a shocking expression of defeatism."

### Foreign Exchange Market Price Reduced Yesterday, US Dollar Benchmark Price 40,000 Yuan, Gold Purchase Price Changed to 1.6 Million Yuan

[Our Report] The foreign exchange market price was reduced for the first time yesterday by the designated banks, China, Communications, Citibank, HSBC and other four banks, with the approval of the Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund Committee. The US dollar benchmark price was adjusted to 40,000 yuan. Based on this ratio, the benchmark prices of other countries' currencies are: British pound 118,000 yuan, Hong Kong dollar 7,375 yuan, and rupee 8,850 yuan. The buying and selling prices of the designated banks yesterday were: US dollar buy 39,500 yuan, sell 40,500 yuan. British pound buy 116,500 yuan, sell 119,500 yuan. Hong Kong dollar buy 7,250 yuan, sell 7,500 yuan. Rupee buy 8,700 yuan, sell 9,000 yuan.

According to various related parties, the main reason for the initial reduction in the exchange rate is to balance supply and demand in the foreign exchange market. Also, because the black market exchange rate continues to exist, it has a considerable impact on our overseas remittances, so the necessary and reasonable adjustments to the exchange rate are made based on the actual situation.

Also, the Central Bank's purchase price for gold was stipulated to be 40 US dollars per tael. Yesterday, because the US dollar benchmark rate had risen to 40,000 yuan, the bank's purchase price for gold was also increased to 1.6 million yuan per tael in legal currency.

### Short-Term Treasury Bill Issuance Amount, 20 Million US Dollars in September, Central Bank to Start Issuance Tomorrow

After the short-term treasury bills for 1947 were sold at market prices, they have aroused the interest of general investors, and it is expected that buyers will be more enthusiastic, and the speculative atmosphere can also be shifted, so that the financial market is brought into the right track. However, after the sudden concentration of floating funds in treasury bills, it is inevitable that the market will be excessively tightened, and the government's burden will inevitably increase when the principal and interest are due. In view of this, the authorities decided that the Ministry of Finance will stipulate the issuance amount on a monthly basis and notify the National Bank to follow suit. It is heard that the National Bank will determine the quotas according to the 19 designated issuing areas to facilitate the issuance. It is also known that the issuance amount for September has been set by the Ministry of Finance at 20 million US dollars. The National Bank will start issuing on the 8th.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 6th] The Ministry of Finance and the National Bank have recently discussed and improved the method of continuing to issue the 1947 US Dollar Bonds and short-term treasury bills. (1) The issuance amount of short-term treasury bills for each subsequent month will be stipulated by the Ministry of Finance, and the Central Bank will be notified, and the Central Bank will notify and plan the distribution of issuance in various places. (2) The US dollar bonds will temporarily be purchased in accordance with Article 4, Paragraph 1 of the US Dollar Bond Regulations, that is, limited to the purchase with US dollar deposits or US dollar cash. Purchasers who purchase with US dollar cash are exempt from the exchange fee. The provisions of Paragraphs 2 and 3 of the same article, which allow purchase with deposits or cash in other foreign currencies and gold, are temporarily suspended. The above two measures have been telegraphed by the Ministry of Finance to the Central Bank for reference and implementation.

### Assistance and Guidance Committee for Silk Production and Sales Discusses Autumn Cocoon Purchase Methods

[Report from our newspaper] The 19th regular meeting of the Assistance and Guidance Committee for Silk Production and Sales, under the Ministries of Agriculture and Economy, was held at the Central Bank conference room yesterday, the 6th, starting at 10:00 AM. More than 20 people attended, including Chu Fucheng, Leng Yuqiu, Xu Boyuan, and Wan Jingzhong. Chairman Tan Xihong reported on the negotiation and procurement of autumn cocoon loans in Beijing. Then, Xu Baiguo, representing the government, explained the significance and process of the decision to continue purchasing cocoons and the seven related measures. Subsequently, Leng Yuqiu, Chu Fucheng, Liu Gongyun, and others expressed their opinions. Finally, several important matters were discussed, detailed as follows:

(1) Regarding the second item in the purchase methods, which stipulates that the maximum price for fresh cocoons purchased by silk factories should not exceed 1 million yuan per dan, there are many difficulties in implementation. This is because the maximum price for spring cocoons this year has already been set at 1.2 million yuan. Therefore, it is proposed to follow the spring cocoon method and stipulate that autumn cocoon reeling be calculated at 460 skeins, with the standard cocoon price set at 1.08 million yuan per dan. Furthermore, the third item in the methods stipulates that manufacturers should complete all subsequent processing of purchased raw silk before the end of October, which seems too tight. It is proposed to extend the deadline to the end of November. Regarding the above two points, it was decided to send an urgent telegram to the Executive Yuan for adoption and implementation.

A draft of "Guidelines for Autumn Cocoon Purchase Affairs" was prepared for resolution. It was resolved that the draft would be reviewed by a small group convened by the Farmers Bank of China, the Central Bank, the China Silk Corporation, and the Assistance and Guidance Committee, and then submitted to the chairman for approval and implementation.

(3) It is requested that a date be set for manufacturers to register for autumn loans. It was decided that a public announcement would be made immediately in the newspaper, and registration procedures would be handled at the committee within two days, the 7th and 8th. Late applications will be considered a waiver of rights.

### Reduction in the Price of Rayon Allocation

Furthermore, the amount of rayon allocated by the Bureau for August was 2059 and 13/20 boxes for manufacturers in this city, and 484 boxes for manufacturers outside this city, totaling 2543 and 13/20 boxes allocated.

### Weak Actual Sales of Rice

Yesterday, a total of 7,000 shi (石) or more of rice arrived in the northern and southern markets. After the price increases, the prices are too high, and shopkeepers are hesitant. Actual sales are sluggish. Indica rice has fallen back by 10,000 yuan, and the price of polished rice has also fallen by 35,000 yuan to 10,000 yuan. The price of new Du polished rice and new polished rice has increased sharply by 120,000 yuan, while the price of white Yuan new indica rice remains stable. The allocation price of flour remains unchanged. Market sales have become smoother, and the price of both standard flour and mixed-brand flour has increased by 1,000 yuan. Bran sales in rural areas are active, with a sharp increase of 23,000 yuan.

Sales of bean cake to outside buyers are weak, with prices falling by 500 to 1,000 yuan. Retail sales of soybeans in this city are slow. Oil factories are unenthusiastic due to the sluggishness of both bean cake and oil. Sales to outside buyers are slow, with prices falling by 35,000 yuan. Sales of mung beans are both small, with no temporary fluctuations. The situation is similar for field peas. Wheat is firm, and sales of 20% silk waste are still active, with a firm market trend.

Due to the suspension of red sorghum from Qingdao, the price has fallen by 10,000 yuan. The price of corn from the north remains unchanged, but it is on a declining path again, with a sharp drop of 10,000 yuan, forming a pattern of sudden rises and falls, making it difficult to predict. The supply of new sesame seeds is increasing. With foreign firms suspending operations, cargo owners are wary. Sales are sluggish, with a gradual decrease of 10,000 yuan, and the price of medium-grade sesame has plummeted by 120,000 yuan.

The allocation price of oil remains unchanged. Market transactions are average. Raw oil has fallen again by 120,000 yuan. Rapeseed oil is stable. Sesame oil has also seen little change. Soybean oil is stable, and clear oil remains firm.

### Autumn Silk Purchase This Year Will Be Supervised by the Ministries of Finance, Economy, and Agriculture; Purchase Methods Will Be Determined with Reference to Production and Sales Plans

[Report from our newspaper] According to a report from the Four Banks Joint Treasury: Since the government revised its foreign exchange policy, except for tungsten, antimony, and other minerals, as well as spring silk and 35-year tea that have already been approved, the Executive Yuan has decided not to purchase other export goods in order to reduce the burden on the national treasury and promote the independent development of various industries. However, in the case of raw silk, due to the recent downward trend in New York market prices, the national currency equivalent of exported raw silk is estimated to be around 20 million yuan per dan. If the government stops purchasing autumn silk this year, manufacturers, in order to reduce costs and avoid losses, will inevitably drastically lower the prices of cocoons, thereby affecting the livelihoods of silkworm farmers. The governments of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, as well as representatives of public opinion organizations, have repeatedly reported their difficulties to the central government, requesting that autumn silk this year continue to be purchased according to the spring plan. The National Economic Commission of the Executive Yuan has repeatedly studied the matter, and in order to take into account the livelihoods of silkworm farmers, it has approved seven measures,勉准 (reluctantly approving) continued purchases with reference to the spring silk production and sales plan this year. However, the maximum cocoon price should not exceed 1 million yuan. The spring cocoon loan program should also be completed by the end of October. The production and sales plan for silk next year should be formulated separately.

Furthermore, in order to ensure the effective implementation of these measures and to prevent manufacturers from raising silk production costs and increasing the burden on the national treasury, the Executive Yuan has specifically designated the Ministries of Finance, Economy, and Agriculture and Forestry, as well as the Import and Export Control Committee, to be responsible for supervising the Assistance and Guidance Committee for Silk Production and Sales, ensuring that it strictly complies with the approved measures and handles matters accordingly.

(4) The Joint Venture Company will provide the Fangjian Company with an irrevocable letter of credit or a bank guarantee for collection upon arrival of the goods.

(5) The contract will be for a period of six months. After the expiration of the period, if both parties have no objections, it will continue to be effective for another six months.

### Starting with the Tuition Fees of Municipal Middle Schools

— Zu Wang

Let's first look at a tuition bill from a municipal middle school:

(1) Tuition: 30,000 for high school, 20,000 for junior high

(2) Miscellaneous fees: 54,000 yuan across the board

(3) Medical and health fees: 6,000 yuan

(4) Supplementary repair and purchase fees: 160,000 for high school, 120,000 for junior high

(5) Compensation reserve fund: 20,000 yuan

(6) Uniform fee: (unspecified)

(7) Teacher academic advancement fee: (unspecified)

Excluding items (6) and (7), which are undecided, the amount due is 270,000 yuan for high school and 220,000 yuan for junior high.

But the problem comes: representatives of the teachers and staff of the municipal middle school actually considered that the advanced education fee for high school should be one shi (石) of rice (priced at 400,000 yuan) and eight dou (斗) for junior high (320,000 yuan). After the mayor's approval, it was reduced to 300,000 yuan for high school and 250,000 yuan for junior high, as a subsidy for academic advancement.

According to the Ministry of Education's regulations, public schools can only collect a portion of tuition and miscellaneous fees, and the amount should not exceed 30,000 yuan. Now, the Bureau of Education is violating this principle, insisting on collecting fees indiscriminately, creating various pretexts, and disregarding educational laws and regulations.

Moreover, municipal middle schools should have an obligatory nature. Since they are established by the municipal government, all expenses should naturally be taken from the municipal government. Does the municipal government clearly not have an education budget item? Now, it is necessary to collect additional fees from each student, so there is no need to list education expenses as a budget item, and there is no need to set up municipal middle schools.

Although 25% of each school can be free, there are many monks and little porridge, where can it be allocated? Because from the adjusted fee numbers, high school is likely to exceed 600,000, junior high school is at least more than 500,000, which is almost the same as the tuition fees of private middle schools.

Therefore, a large number of poor students will again suffer the crisis of being out of school. From a factual point of view: in the future, the education crisis in Shanghai will not only deepen, but also affect the collapse of the entire secondary education. Under the slogan of "building the country through education" shouted today, what are our thoughts?

### Light Sentence

— Yan Ping

The private school tuition fee issue, which had been debated for a long time, was finally resolved under the call for a "light sentence" by Director Gu and the impartial handling by Mayor Wu.

Who knew that one wave had just subsided, and another wave rose. Teachers and staff of municipal schools jointly requested an increase in training fees, from 100,000 yuan to 500,000 yuan per month. If the city government's finances are insufficient, then collect tuition rice from students' parents, six dou per person, equivalent to 240,000 yuan in legal tender. This request not only poses a serious threat to general parents, but also poses another problem for Mayor Wu and Director Gu! Even the Municipal Council believes that the issue is important and will leave it for the next discussion.

The issue of education is really too serious. One by one, one by one, connected, I don't know when we can plan a concrete and fundamental solution.

The poor treatment and difficult lives of primary school teachers are indeed undeniable facts.

For private school teachers' salaries, in order to "live within one's means" for most schools, they cannot be uniformly distributed. There are certainly many with generous salaries, and there are also many who are too poor to even drink porridge. Therefore, the increase in tuition fees for private schools seems to be "excusable" due to the personal living conditions of the teachers.

The salaries of municipal school teachers are stipulated by the municipal government, and must also be paid in accordance with the salaries of civil servants. Not only is it the same throughout the city, but there are also in-kind allocations to enjoy, which can reduce the threat of rising prices. It can be seen that the salaries of municipal school teachers are better than those of private school teachers.

Even if municipal school teachers still think that their treatment is poor and insufficient to maintain their lives, then they can only ask the Bureau of Education and the municipal government to increase their treatment, and must not collect rice from parents.

If municipal schools collect tuition rice, then private schools will definitely cite it as a precedent and follow suit.

Parents have just put up with huge tuition fees, how can they bear the cost of this tuition rice? And all kinds of levies that will follow in the future?

Finally, echoing Director Gu's call, please ask the teachers of municipal schools to "lightly sentence" them and create fewer out-of-school children?

### Teachers are Poor! —Also answer Qingxin Jun's question on September 4th

— A Teacher

Teachers have public and private levels, and they cannot be confused. Because the special encounters of teachers in public schools are paid the same as civil servants. Let's take a high school teacher as the standard. The highest base salary is only 260 yuan, and the lowest cannot exceed 200 yuan. Then, after calculating the recently adjusted 1,800 times in August, plus a subsidy of 440,000 yuan, the highest income is only 900,000 yuan, plus more than 200,000 yuan in rice and coal difference, the total is only within 1.2 million yuan. But remember, this is the highest income of a high school teacher in a public school.

The income of private school teachers is proportionate to the life of the times, which is different from that of public school teachers. Although the facts are not very clear to the author, but according to Qingxin Jun, each high school teacher can get a monthly salary of more than 5 million yuan, and can pay four months in advance at the beginning of school. This kind of treatment seems like a myth to municipal school teachers! But according to the proportion of pre-war life, that 5 million yuan is only enough to buy ten shi of rice, which is only worth 890 yuan in the past. May I ask, in that time, could you hire a high school teacher with 890 yuan? So with this kind of speculation, it is not surprising that private school teachers actually earn more than 5 million yuan a month. What's more, is this abstract, can every private school teacher receive 5 million yuan a month?

"The respected principals would rather bear the name of a school store and be spurned than lower tuition fees? Who exactly is exploiting the lives of teachers?" Qingxin Jun's last few conclusions are very insightful. Speaking of this, although Qingxin Jun is still a student studying, his observation of society is not bad. Because even if you calculate it like this, the teachers in your school, although they eat a month of chalk ash, in fact they will definitely not be able to get the amount you have scheduled. So where did the extra money go? Of course, let me tell you the truth, to prepare to expand the school store and first enrich the pockets of those respected gentlemen!

Speaking of the hardships of public teachers, the difference in the additional amount of 100,000 yuan subsidy per person in August has not been received until today (September 4). The rise in the market these days is so crazy that if the teacher is alone, he will have enough to eat if he takes one million yuan. If you have parents, wife and children, you can only ask them to drink the northwest wind together!

Qingxin Jun, you are a poor child and can appreciate the poor teacher. If your parents are also public school teachers, not to mention raising tuition and book fees, even if your socks are torn, you can only listen to you barefoot.

All in all, we are fools. We are unwilling to mix as private school principals in the education sector, and we are unwilling to join the factories that talk about the cost of living in society. For the sake of the next generation, we have held on to our position to death, and we deserve to be poor!

### School Store Interlude

— Wang Ranxi

——Someone is earning application fees in the name of scholarships

Recently, several advertisements for poor scholarships have been found in newspapers. The method is quite special, such as the recent advertisement published in the Xinwen Bao:

Huimin Poor Scholarship Enrollment:

(1) Purpose: To reward outstanding students and relieve poor children

(2) Number of places: full-tuition students and half-tuition students at all levels of high school and junior high school, a total of 300, who will be recommended to study at various schools.

(3) Application date: from September 3rd to 23rd.

(4) Application address: No. ××××, Baoshan Road, Second College of the University, brochures available upon request.

Try to ask about 300 high school and junior high school tuition fees, averaging 500,000 per student, at least 150 million must be required, where does such a huge amount of money come from? If there is such a huge amount of money, there must be a person with social prestige in charge. Now the person in charge does not know his name, and only borrows the signboard of ×× University, which is obviously a slippery trick. High school and junior high school will probably start classes before September 10, and the application date is as late as September 23, and it is said that they will be recommended to study at various schools. I don't know which school can be recommended? What qualifications can be used to recommend students to study at various schools? It is a rare event in the world if there is such a big philanthropist in Shanghai who is so enthusiastic about rewarding outstanding students and helping as many as 300 poor children.

Before "Huimin", there was also "Nianci", which was also at ×× University. Has × University become a charity organization? It is also out of the question.

The inside story is actually a scam set up by a few boring students, with the aim of only defrauding the registration fee. On the surface, the exam is still held, and the list of admissions is all controlled. Those who apply for the exam can only complain that they are not good enough, because "Nianci" has gained quite a lot, and "Huimin" has followed suit. If this kind of deception continues, the poor children will be endlessly harmed. Therefore, they do not hesitate to expose the inside story. In addition to hoping that the poor children will not be fooled again, they also ask the × University authorities and the police authorities to pay attention to banning it, so as to avoid spreading the poison.

### Another Side of School Store

— Hu Yisheng

Why are so many people vying to be principals?

Schools will open soon, but the heat for activities of principals in various places has not decreased slightly. County councilors and township chiefs all want to be elementary school principals. Section chiefs and staff members of the county government would rather resign from their county positions and take up the post of elementary school principal. It turns out that although they are mixed together as "public teachers and staff", the treatment is "teacher" superior to "public". If they are nobles as principals, they can also deposit and earn interest from tuition revenue, and pay teachers' salaries with interest on a monthly basis. At the end of the semester, all tuition revenue can be reduced to "private". Although we cannot say that all principals belong to this category, but at least it can be said that "most of them are so".

Because of the benefits involved, like flies chasing stench, it is said that the Bureau of Education is also struggling to cope. The original principals cannot all be transferred, and it is inconvenient to reject those introduced by friends. In addition, this year's normal school graduates and transferred military officers should be placed, and it is also natural to transfer and assign relatives and friends of bureau chiefs and section chiefs to be principals. With "less porridge and more monks", the Bureau of Education will naturally have a "difficult" word, screaming hard to welcome the sky. According to the report, those who have been appointed as new principals also have their own difficulties. It is not necessary to say that it costs money, effort and time to launch the offensive. Once the new order is issued, it also costs a lot of trouble to ask all parties to arrange the positions of teachers.

I personally saw that there were six teaching positions in × school. Apart from those rejected by the new principal, there were still fifteen people who were not easy to refuse. In the end, the method of drawing lots was used to decide whether to stay or leave, and there was nothing to say if they were lucky. The inevitable result of this matter is that teachers must advance and retreat with the principal. × school has changed its principal four times since the victory, and every time the principal is changed, the teachers are also changed, which gives the students a very bad impression psychologically.

Recently, the Education Bureau of Wuxi County caused a major disturbance in the education community due to the transfer of principals. At first, the dispute between the Education Bureau and the County Government was caused by the issue of the authority to appoint principals. Then, the former principal refused to hand over, and the new principal failed to take over. The attacks and curses on the Education Bureau were published in the newspapers every day, which is a strange phenomenon unprecedented in the education community! The education community originally stood in the position of leading society, but now it is flowing with the current society, which really makes us cry and laugh! I wonder what the ancient saying "respect teachers and respect the Tao" will start from now on!

What every parent desires is that their children can enter good schools and that the tuition fees can be lighter. Now good schools are hard to come by, but tuition fees are rising. The joint meeting of elementary school principals in Wuxi County actually decided: it is stipulated that tuition fees cannot be reduced anymore, and the public food is willing to be released as leaves. As the principal, he can say it! And the principals present also seconded the decision, which is really strange! We wonder why not decide: "Public food is received as usual, and tuition fees are reduced as usual". Wouldn't the burden on parents be reduced somewhat?

Finally, I am the people, and I cannot help but say a word to the gentlemen of the Council who represent the "people": Education is a sacred career, not an occupation with the purpose of making money. It is inconvenient for the speaker to let his wife and aunt fill the post of principal in order to take advantage of him. At the same time, it is well-deserved and beyond reproach for the principal to serve as a councilor at the same time, but it is unnecessary for the councilor to run a school. At the same time, I am also a parent. I have to say a word to the principal: In ancient times, donating money to build schools was considered expensive, so the principal in the family might as well take some money out, or at least use it from the students and for the students, without entering his private pocket, and return it to the public in small amounts. The tuition fees collected may as well be deposited and earned interest, but the interest income should be used for public affairs. Otherwise, in the future, when prices rise and teachers live in hardship, the society will not sympathize and I will "not pull out a hair" if I want to start a "respect for teachers movement".

(1) We wholeheartedly support Mayor Wu's style of fighting against school stores. But many people object to the municipal school's levy of advanced education fees. I wonder what Mayor Wu thinks?

### My Visit to the Shanhai Rural School

— Fang Ren

— The Little Teachers Earn the Support of the Villagers

Because of my involvement in social education work, this reporter recently took the opportunity to visit the Shanhai Rural Experimental School in Shenjialou, Dachang. The school's predecessor was the Shanhai Industrial Study Group, one of the undertakings founded by Mr. Tao Xingzhi. Mr. Tao advocated using the "Little Teacher System" to popularize education during his lifetime, so the characteristic of the school's teaching methods is the Little Teacher System.

The so-called Little Teacher System is to educate a group of elementary school students to a considerable level, and after considerable training and practice, to divide them into groups to educate the public. It is best for the public to come to the school, but if some people do not have time to leave home to study, the little teachers are sent to their homes. This kind of education facility is, of course, extremely lively!

The school was restored in February last year. At that time, only one person came, and he didn't bring any money. However, in a short period, he mobilized the local people to raise a sum of money and built a simple tile house to serve as a place for teaching. This year, in the same way, another one was added. Because the business is gradually expanding, two private houses have also been borrowed to run branch classes.

The school currently has seven faculty and staff members. They do not cook their own meals, but are supplied in turn by the students' parents or enthusiastic educators. They do not hire a school worker. Except for occasional help from students, they do everything themselves!

In this kind of hard work, the school naturally gains the sympathy and support of the local people, so the business is going very smoothly.

The above is just a superficial impression I gained after visiting the school. I don't want to say more about the detailed situation here. There are only two thoughts that I would like to write down for social reference:

(1) Popularizing education is a problem that the current government and people urgently want to solve. Although the cultural level of this city is high, there are still half of

And the current situation is that one side needs it, but no one supplies it; while the other side has a surplus, but insists on squeezing in. This is the root of social chaos and the crux of the country's poverty and ignorance.

Spring and Autumn

### Shui Long Yin

— Ta Shan

——Responding to Mr. Dingshan

Leaning on the railing, gazing at the layered sky, infinite emotions rise in my chest, a clod of sand, rotten grass, a firefly's light, boundless emptiness; the earth is silent, the sky is vast, the cold wind is bleak; I ask where the lingering sorrow is, placing myself high, easing my pure thoughts, watching the flowing water!

There is a cool taste of its own, try opening my collar in the lotus bushes: a branch is elegant and upright, gracefully stepping on the waves; a wind skirt and water ornaments, calling from across the shore; without tasting the fragrance, I have already communicated with elegant words. I fear the "White Snow in the Sunny Spring," the words are too high to harmonize, continuing Jin Diao's tail.

Furthermore, this Ci form has many variations and many Chen works; but the Huaihai Ci is the most popular. Therefore, this one is also named "Small Building Connected to Gardens," taking the first sentence of the Huaihai Ci as the name. The differences of this Ci are the first two sentences and the eighth and ninth sentences in the first section. However, the Huaihai Ci as printed in various editions are different. "The last sentence of the first section in the Poetry Remnants Diagram Spectrum has seven characters, which is different from what is printed in other books, so it is suspected that there is an error in the diagram spectrum. Also, the last two sentences of the second section are sometimes written as a seven-character sentence and a six-character sentence. However, after examining various sources, the nine-character sentence followed by a four-character sentence is the most common. If the first character of the last four-character sentence should be read, then the four-character form is the most correct. Now, looking at Mr. Dingshan's original manuscript, there are things that should be consulted, such as the missing four characters after 'Where to address sorrowful zither' in the first section. Is it a different form, or is it a printing error? Also, in the last two sentences of the second section, the small introduction says that the upper sentence has seven characters and the lower sentence has six characters, but the printed words have nine characters and four characters. The words can be flexible, and my draft follows the Ci form. I hope someone can correct it. (Ta Shan's note) Last month on the sixteenth, this publication carried Mr. Dingshan's Shui Long Yin Ci, saying:

"Half a life of lakes and seas, heroic feelings, spending sorrow with flowers and wine, dissolving heroic spirit. Looking at the scenery in high autumn, the distant geese are writing, how many lines can be sent? The North Sea has collected wine cups, the East Mountain has passed events, and still remains the guest drama. Where to address sorrowful zither, a city of silk pipes (four characters missing in the original), under the cherry blossoms, empty carrying courtesans. Betting on the flag pavilion under the sun. Singing Yangguan, the evening glow is boundless. Pu Qing Mu Bi, looking at how much, the slanting sun flies on horseback. Recruiting hermits in the west of the city, the turban is alone, the water court is a quiet temple. Remaining the world's green ink, spreading beautiful sentences, filling the land of Jiangnan."

According to the "Bai Xiang Ci Spectrum," the character "Ban" in Dingshan's opening sentence should be "Ping." The character "Kan" in "How many lines can be sent?" should be "Ke" or "Hao" or "Dai." The character "Shi" in "East Mountain's events are gone" should be "Ren" or "Shen" or "Yun" or "Chen." The character "Tao" in "Under the plum blossoms" should be "Shu" or "Liu." The character "Du" in "Betting on the flag pavilion under the sun" should be "You" or "Hua" or "Lin." The character "Fei" in "The slanting sun flies on horseback" should be "Zong" or "An" or "Fang." The character "Du" in "The turban is alone" should be "You." In Ci and Qu, sound and rhythm are the most important, followed by the meaning of the words, and then the style and charm. Therefore, it can be sung repeatedly with the Red Ivory Clapper and the rapid strings. Therefore, such allusions as "betting on the villa" and "flying on horseback" are not in harmony with the original rhythm, so it is better to give them up, or replace them with corresponding words. I wonder if my Dingshan brother thinks so? Dongshan and Beihai use the stories of Confucius and Xie An, and the unrestrained and leisurely feelings of that year can be imagined. However, the world is bumpy, leaving only Ban Gu's "Guest Mocking Guest Drama" article. A sigh of the same. The overall meaning is too mixed, the words are too strong, the Qi is too stagnant, and the emotion is too sparse. However, the spirit, reason, realm, and style are close to Xin Qiji and Su Shi, and it can be called a good structure. It is a pity that four characters are missing after "Where to address sorrowful zither," which must be a printing error? Now I imitate it and playfully sing a hundred and twenty characters of old feelings. Lower class songs of Ba fill the tail of the sable.

Dingshan's note: There are more than fifty Ci in response to this "Shui Long Yin," all of which are beautiful and have been thanked separately by letter. However, Mr. "Ta Shan" and "Yue Han" did not provide their addresses in their letters, and their words are unsurpassed and their arguments are detailed, which is especially admirable! Now I will specially publish the original work, and attach my humble opinions as follows. The painting of the 　 is because there are too many incoming letters, and I will try to write them separately and thank them.

In my humble work "Where to address sorrowful zither, the fragrant study in the horizon, under the cherry blossoms, empty carrying courtesans," four characters are missing, and I am grateful for pointing it out. Your great work uses the oblique tone in the character "Zhi" in "Placing oneself high," which is especially admirable. I think that the humble meaning of the last 　 is that all the orchids such as "Looking carefully at the rice" can be written as "upper seven and lower six," "upper five and lower four four," and reading them has the pleasure of flowing clouds and flowing water, so I have presumed to do so. "Remaining the world's green ink, spreading beautiful sentences, filling the land of Jiangnan" can be "seven six," or "five four four," but also "seven three three." I made it according to my own heart, and made a big joke. I still hope to be taught to stop.

Mr. Yue Han responded in the original rhyme and added 　 comments, which is especially appreciated. According to the Ci rhythm, the first character of "Shui Long Yin" should be in the level tone, as in "Chu sky is thousands of miles clear autumn." I thought that my humble work "Yuan Long has not exhausted his arrogance" was not harmonious; so I changed it to "Half a life" and so on. The Ci rhythm of "How many lines can be sent" is "Jade 　 Luo 　 "; The Ci rhythm of "East Mountain's events are gone" is broken, "Sound" Qiu, note that it can be in the oblique tone. "Where to address sorrowful zither, a city of silk pipes, under the cherry blossoms empty carrying courtesans." The character "Ying" was mistakenly written as "Mei" in the horizon sentence, which should be corrected. "Under the cherry blossoms" The Ci rhythm is "no one will," which is certainly level level oblique, not level oblique oblique. "The slanting sun flies on horseback," the Ci rhythm is "Liu Lang's talent"; "The turban is alone," the Ci rhythm is "sad wind and rain," note that "sad" and "wind" can both be in the oblique tone, so I followed it.

The Ci rhythm says that the first character can be in the level tone, it is better to start with the oblique tone, and the rhyme may not be harmonious from the starting sentence. The ending sentence "Wiping away the tears of a hero," the names of heroes are often connected like this. Although the Ci rhythm has many words made according to the heart, this theory is indeed common, so I followed it. I have also revised the previous work. According to Sao Ye Shan Fang's "Examination and Correction" of the Bai Xiang Ci Spectrum, it is the original work of Bai Xiang, and what I have added to it is what I did when I was young (twenty years old). See the preface of my father. However, the arguments are mostly broad, and the disadvantages of making them according to the heart are inevitable. I don't know where the "Bai Xiang Ci Spectrum" you quoted was published. If it is my humble work "Examination and Correction," I hope you will not hesitate to point out any errors. As for the criticism of my humble Ci, it can be said to be penetrating seven layers, and I dare not but thank you. Your words are beautiful, very similar to Bai Shi, but there is "sound" when flowers fly, and the character "sound" should be in the oblique tone. I recklessly discuss a word, and I hope you will forgive me. (The manuscript fee for this article will be used to help the student loan fund)

### Another Ci Responding to Mr. Dingshan's Original Rhyme

— Sun Yue Han

The horizon is a glance, my mind flies; thousands of oceans, heroic spirit. In my youthful years, in the midst of silk and embroidery, secret thoughts are entrusted. Green sleeves and green shirts, vermilion lips and white teeth, leaning on the railing and chanting playfully. I hate that people have left today, the building is empty and the fragrance is gone. Hearing the swallows speak, I am saddened by the prostitutes.

I remember wandering in the fragrant villa, teasing my secret feelings, between the corners of my eyes and eyebrows. Flowers fly with sound, water flows without intention, riding double on snow. The most is the slanting sun, stirring people's emotions, secretly leaving the cloud temple. I bitterly turn my head several times to look at you, and the parting tears are sprinkled on the soul-stirring land.

I pick flower buds and smell them when I hate wine 　 I hear the sound of Sheng songs from the other hall 　 Everything is ice like

### The Beauty of the Painting

— Liu Shi

Beauty is initially used in various situations, such as the beauty of nature, the beauty of art, and used for other various kinds of beauty. Here, we will only describe the beauty that belongs to the most special painting, especially about "the beauty of the picture."

We often say: "This painting is very beautiful." But the meaning of this so-called "painting is very beautiful" can be divided into two situations. One is that the materials used to make this painting are very beautiful; the second is that the painting itself is full of artistic beauty. The former belongs to the superficial view of general laymen; and what we call "this painting is very beautiful" belongs to the latter. That is to say, it has reached the level of having "the beauty of the picture."

For example: if we deal with a beautiful flower, it is not only to depict that flower vividly, so that it retains its natural existence, but to restore its realistic natural state to the artistic existence state. That is to say, in the situation of painting, what we require is not the restoration of nature, but the restoration of painting.

The so-called "restoration of painting" is to completely deny all the beauty of nature in order to obtain the effect of painting, which must first be intercepted by the painter's sensibility. That is to say, the beautiful flower in nature, through the painter's sensibility, reappears as the flower on the surface, which is no longer the flower in the natural state of existence, but has been restored to the flower in the artistic state of existence. This is the meaning of restoring the beauty of nature to the beauty of painting. And we call this kind of flower existing in the painter's heart only a painting image of a flower.

This so-called image must be realized and "realized" in painting. In order to realize this painting image of a flower as a painting, painting materials and techniques must be used. Therefore, the so-called "aesthetic reduction" (Aesthetische Reduktion) is produced, so that the painting image has the beauty of painting.

In order to make the Xiaozhong image with the beauty of painting, it is necessary to study the so-called "painting effect" in order to realize it as a painting.

For example: in a certain early spring season in the countryside, barley is only beginning to sprout tender buds, and what appears in front of the eyes is mostly reddish-black soil, which is watered with foul-smelling fertilizer, and the spring cold is biting, and there is no warm and bright sunshine. Generally, seeing this scene may not arouse any good feelings! If a painter (let's assume he is an excellent painter) sees such a scene and feels interested and feels a special beauty, he intercepts an image with the beauty of painting from this ordinary nature, and may create a painting with special beauty, a painting with beauty that is completely different from nature. In this situation, it can be said that the painter has been able to express "the beauty of the picture" according to that "painting cause." And nature itself, although it is considered ugly and ordinary, the painter can feel a special beauty in that nature, and can fully make that special beauty painted and fully capture the effect of painting. From this point of view, the so-called beauty of the picture is obviously not the beauty of the unchanging original form of existence of nature, that is to say, it specifically refers to the beauty of the state of existence of the painting.

From the examples and theories mentioned above, we can know that the so-called beauty of painting is the true value of painting, that is, the true meaning of the beauty of art. Therefore, in the entire picture, whether it is the image, color, brushstroke, or even a point or a coin, it must have a sufficient painting effect. Otherwise, we can only say that it is a colored photograph, which is not worthy of being included in the field of painting. To put it more thoroughly, the so-called beauty of the picture is no different from referring to the situation where the picture has a pure painting effect. Here, there is absolutely no beauty of natural nature, everything has been restored to the beauty of the artistic state of existence, and all the beauty has become the beauty of painting.

### An Inch of Mountain and River, an Inch of Blood

— Ye Jingfeng

"I have my reasons, Tiger Brother!" Yaoqun told Little Tiger like this. "Let's just fight guerrilla warfare... go to the front line..." Little Tiger still grabbed that bag of herbal medicine, sat down next to Yaoqun, and lowered his voice: "Anyway, we can't understand 'ghost chirping' (Japanese)... let Uncle Yue do that thing, we'll do ours..."

Little Tiger's intention was that he was afraid that Yaoqun was a woman and extraordinarily beautiful, so doing intelligence work and mixing into the enemy's circle might be dangerous. Therefore, she needed to disguise herself, and even destroy her face. If she specialized in guerrilla and front-line work, she could avoid the trouble of disguise.

"You don't understand, Tiger Brother," Yaoqun replied faintly. "I don't understand? I understand everything, Aunt Ji!" Little Tiger became a little anxious: "We're fighting a war, only for a few months; at most, a year or two... but if you use this thing, didn't Grandpa Qiu say it can't be cured for a lifetime?" Little Tiger was concerned about Yaoqun's lifelong event, and he did have a great principle in his heart, but his teeth and words could not express his meaning.

"Don't be so fussy, child," Yaoqun smiled reluctantly, "What about a lifetime?... Besides, I have a way, I've experimented in the village, and found an antidote. Who said it can't be cured for a lifetime?" Yaoqun didn't want to argue with Little Tiger any more, so she lied to him.

Little Tiger was not so easily fooled; "There's an antidote?... Then I want to try it too." This move was very cunning, and even Yaoqun didn't expect it.

"Don't keep nagging about this!" Yaoqun wanted to end the topic with pressure.

Although Little Tiger didn't nag anymore, he was worried. Usually, thirty dumplings and two bowls of noodles, even if he ate them all by himself, he could finish them in one meal. At this time, Yaoqun also helped to eat some, but there were still noodles in the bowl and more than twenty dumplings left in the basin, but Little Tiger seemed to have something stuck in his throat, and he couldn't swallow them.

"Tiger Brother!" Yaoqun was preparing to explain one of her two reasons; because she knew that Little Tiger's personality was exceptionally tenacious and his nature was exceptionally pure and honest. Once he was worried, he would never let go until he settled it properly.

"What is it, Aunt Ji?" Little Tiger simply put down his chopsticks.

"Eat quickly, we still have things to do. While you eat, I'll tell you the truth..."

"Huh?" Little Tiger lazily picked up the chopsticks again, but his eyes were burningly searching Yaoqun's face; he wanted to see how true this "truth" of Yaoqun's really was. One

"This thing we're in charge of, we have to do everything, literary and martial, front line and rear, irrelevant areas, sometimes we have to walk around in the enemy's circle. You probably know this, don't you? Men, of course, don't matter, but a woman...

"I know, but..." Little Tiger wanted to argue.

"Listen to me..." Yaoqun didn't let Little Tiger refute: "If you only do intelligence, you can go out in the appearance of a woman. I also told you about it; many spies, international and domestic, also have many women participating. As long as the appearance is good, you can rely on this point to get many advantages, right? But there are different levels of people and different ways of doing things, and everyone has their own temper. Me? You know, I don't want to do it this way..."
