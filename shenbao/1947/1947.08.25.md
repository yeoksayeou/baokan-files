### Wei Envoy Issues Candid Statement Offering Opinions on Reform for Our Nation; Government Will Surely Gain Popular Support If Reforms Are Vigorously Implemented; If the Chinese Communists Truly Love the Country, They Should Abandon Armed Force

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 24th] The U.S. Embassy today released Special Envoy Wedemeyer's statement upon leaving China. The full text is as follows:

"As I initially promised to the press, we have conducted investigations into the economic, political, military, and social conditions with an attitude free from any constraints or preconceptions. Everyone in our group has strived to be objective and fair. To achieve this goal, we have traveled extensively, including to Shenyang and Fushun in the Northeast; Beiping, Tianjin, Qingdao, and Jinan in North China; Nanjing and Hankou in Central China; and Guangzhou and Taiwan in South China, to avoid being unduly influenced by any single region.

We have made successful efforts to make contact with people of all classes and backgrounds. We have categorized them by their economic status, cultural achievements, and differing political viewpoints. Foreign merchants and officials have also met with me. We have also met with government and local officials, as well as personnel from various political groups, including many who frankly criticized the government and held extremely leftist views. We have received over two thousand letters, a small portion of which were anonymous. These letters included many suggestions that have greatly benefited us.

During our final week in China, our work has primarily focused on analyzing the vast amount of information we have gathered on political, economic, and other fronts, in order to arrive at accurate judgments and conclusions. Although opinions vary, one point is universally shared: in turbulent China, the Chinese people all yearn for peace—early peace and lasting peace. I firmly believe that the means to achieve peace are equally evident.

After the surrender of Japan, the Chinese people rightfully hoped to enjoy the fruits of their hard-won victory. They endured hardship and danger in the effort to expel the brutal invaders, and suffered indescribable suffering. In today's China, what we see in many ways is an attitude of indifference, neither seeking to solve problems nor spending considerable time and energy blaming external influences or seeking external aid. Many Chinese, originally highly capable and patriotic, who should be full of hope and determination, are now filled with demoralizing defeatism. It is disheartening to say the least! Despite years of war and revolution hindering and weakening China, it still possesses most of the resources to undertake its own reconstruction. China's revival depends on wise leadership and a moral and spiritual rebirth, and these factors can only be found within China.

While I fully understand the interests and problems of specifically designated individuals or groups, I am also deeply concerned about the overall welfare of the Chinese people. I firmly believe that if the Chinese Communists are sincerely patriotic and concerned about the country's welfare, they should voluntarily abandon their efforts to achieve their ideology through force. If they genuinely want to help the Chinese people, they should also replace the regrettable violence and destruction of the past few months with peaceful means. If corrupt or incompetent officials in key positions (especially in provincial and municipal institutions, not just within the government organization) can be removed, the current central government will certainly be able to gain and retain the unanimous and enthusiastic support of the majority of the people. This point is of equal importance.

There is no shortage of outstanding officials who demonstrate superior efficiency and dedication, and who live on their meager salaries and legitimate private property. Similarly, there are also conscientious businessmen who are quite capable of abiding by commercial ethics, but I emphasize that the multitude of corrupt or incompetent officials, or those who are both corrupt and incompetent, should leave no room for misunderstanding.

To regain and maintain the faith of the Chinese people, the central government should immediately implement rigorous and far-reaching political and economic reforms. Mere promises will not suffice; demonstrable action is absolutely necessary. Force alone cannot eradicate communism; this point must be accepted.

As our group and I depart China, we express our sincere gratitude to President Chiang and all the patriotic Chinese people we have met for their assistance. We are also deeply grateful for the courteous treatment we have received from all parties. All Americans hope that China will achieve the unity, prosperity, and happiness that the Chinese people deserve and have seemed to have lost for many years."

### Wedemeyer Flies to Tokyo; Will Go to Korea Tomorrow for Second-Stage Investigation; Before Leaving Nanjing, Visited President and Mrs. Chiang for a Long Talk

[United Press Tokyo Dispatch on the 24th] General Wedemeyer, who is investigating the facts, arrived in Tokyo on the 24th and plans to confer with MacArthur before proceeding to Korea to begin the second stage of the investigation. Wedemeyer arrived at Haneda Airport at 3:35 PM on the 24th. Those who went to the airport to welcome him included Sebald, chairman of the Allied Council for Japan, General Shang Wei, representative of the Chinese Allied Council for Japan, and Colonel Penkell, aide to MacArthur.

Wedemeyer plans to go to Korea on the 26th and will stay there for eight or ten days. A spokesman for Wedemeyer said that the purpose of the trip to Tokyo is to obtain from MacArthur a summary of the situation in Korea. After the trip to Korea, Wedemeyer will return to Tokyo for a short stay, after which he will return to the United States.

Observers believe that MacArthur and Wedemeyer will discuss Japan's possible role in preventing the spread of communism. According to them, Japan, which has traditionally feared Russian aggression, may be willing to cooperate in the anti-communist ideological front in China, Japan, and Korea. It has been pointed out that the Wedemeyer mission is closely related to the Marshall Plan for Europe, and that Wedemeyer is inclined to recommend supervised aid to the "non-communist areas" of China. Like China, Korea is dominated by communist groups in the northern regions, and Wedemeyer's biggest problem is expected to be planning the best way to help the people in the U.S.-occupied area of South Korea. Korea is also under MacArthur's command.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 24th] Wedemeyer and his mission left Nanjing by plane for Japan and then Korea on the morning of the 24th. Those who went to the airport to see him off included Wu Dingchang (representing President Chiang), Gan Naikang (representing Premier Zhang), Liu Shi Shun (representing Foreign Minister Wang), Bai Chongxi, Chen Cheng, Weng Wenhao, Yu Dawei, Shen Yi, Gui Yongqing, Zhou Zhirou, Wu Siyu, Liu Naifan, Ling Qihan, Wang Jizhen, Yu Bin, Zhou Hongchong, Pan Chaoying, and more than a hundred officers from the U.S. Embassy and the U.S. Military Advisory Group. At about 8 a.m., accompanied by Ambassador Stuart, Wedemeyer drove to President Chiang's residence on Huangpu Road to bid farewell to President and Mrs. Chiang, talking for about an hour. Arriving at Daxiaochang Airport at 9:20 a.m., he reviewed the honor guard and shook hands with each of those who came to see him off before boarding the plane. At 9:45 a.m., the Constellation aircraft broke through the clouds and soared into the sky. As Wedemeyer stood on the handrail of the boarding ladder, he directly called out Stuart's name: "Thank you for your help over the past month," and offered his blessings before departing. In the final moment of farewell to each of those who welcomed him, Wedemeyer frequently waved from inside the plane window. Wedemeyer arrived in Nanjing on July 22 and stayed in China for one month and two days before departing on the 24th.

### Wei Envoy Hopes We Eradicate Corruption; All Parties Share the Same Sentiment; Chen Yaodong Says This Has Always Been the Proposition of the Political Consultative Council

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 24th] Councilor Chen Yaodong commented on Wedemeyer's statement on the 24th, saying that the opinions expressed by Wedemeyer have always been the propositions of the Political Consultative Council, but the executors have failed to adopt them, causing our domestic affairs to be further elaborated by friendly countries, which is worthy of our deep reflection. Wedemeyer hopes that our country can eradicate corruption. In fact, the reorganization of governance should start from the local level, because local officials are close to the people, and if there are problems with their integrity, the people will be directly harmed. At present, corruption is rampant and bribery is prevalent, so it is necessary to eradicate it.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 24th] A certain leader of the Democratic Socialist Party commented on Wedemeyer's farewell remarks on the 24th, saying that Wedemeyer's words are very sincere. His hope that China can reflect on itself coincides with our long-standing advocacy of "self-reliance." The points regarding corruption, etc., are also the current reality and should be urgently rectified. As for the Chinese Communist issue, the party's position has been seen in the Common Administrative Program. In other words, a political solution is still the basic policy.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 24th] Youth Party Committee Member Yu Jiaju commented on General Wedemeyer's farewell message on the 24th, saying that what Wedemeyer said in his statement, "If the Chinese Communists truly put the country's happiness first, they should be willing to stop using force to achieve their ideology," is indeed true, but it is a pity that the Chinese Communists do not have such ambitions! Wedemeyer hopes that the central and local governments can be reformed. We also share this sentiment, because if politics is unsound, it will affect morale and public sentiment. As for what Wedemeyer said, "China still possesses the natural resources needed for national construction, so it should reflect on itself," it is not that we do not seek to work hard and strive for self-improvement, but after eight years of war against Japan and in the midst of long-term revolutionary disasters, some aspects have become unbalanced, and world security is indivisible. For the sake of the future of the world, the United States should provide more assistance in construction.

### Neutral Observers on the Issue of U.S. Aid to China

[United Press Nanjing Dispatch on the 24th] The release of Wedemeyer's candid statement has led neutral observers to the following conclusions:

First, the possibility of large-scale political loans from the United States to China is out of the question in the short term.

Second, any direct action is unlikely before the U.S. Congress reconvenes in January next year, as there is nothing in Wedemeyer's message that warrants calling a special session of Congress.

Third, any financial or military assistance to China will be conditional on President Chiang allowing the United States to closely supervise and control the supply and planning of funds.

It is generally known that President Chiang personally suggested to Wedemeyer that U.S. advisors cooperate with Chinese officials in economic, political, and military aspects to open the door to "controlled" U.S. aid. Observers here believe that even this plan may be welcomed by Congress.

### Ambassador Stuart to Visit Yanjing University Soon to Inspect School Affairs

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 24th] After Wedemeyer and his party left Beijing, Ambassador Stuart told our reporter that he will go to Beijing in the near future to inspect the affairs of Yanjing University and preside over the opening ceremony on September 8. The Ambassador looked slightly thinner than before, but when answering reporters' questions, he said that he had not been too busy recently. He declined to judge whether Wedemeyer's work was extremely successful, but said that Wedemeyer's work was extremely hard.

### Seeing Off Special Envoy Wedemeyer

— Our Reporter Pu Dejie

If Special Envoy Wedemeyer came to China in a frenzy, then the atmosphere when he left was completely refreshing, refreshing weather, refreshing mood.

On the morning of August 24, the refreshing autumn breeze blew the gray and white sails of the clouds, and the passion of summer was near Lanshan. At Daxiaochang Airport, beside the Constellation aircraft, stood people who were leaving and people who came to see them off. Except for General Wei, who was accompanied by Ambassador Stuart to bid farewell to President and Mrs. Chiang, most of the people who were there on the 22nd of last month were there. Political Advisor Mr. Sprouse and his companions and friends of the embassy were taking pictures, Engineering Advisor Rear Admiral Cooke and Minister Yu Dawei, holding a khaki hat, were chatting, and News Advisor Mr. Watson accepted "safe travels" from every Chinese reporter and foreign reporter. A colleague suggested that everyone take a photo with him, but all the photographers were concentrated on the left side of the plane, waiting from one end of the honor guard to the other. Wu Hanmin (translator) and Secretary General Gan Naikang walked over talking all the way.

The black car with the stars and stripes came, and Ambassador Stuart and General Wedemeyer got out one after another, inspected the honor guard with big steps, and walked towards the crowd of well-wishers, followed by countless "safe travels," tight handshakes, and sincere "thank yous." An embassy official kissed his wife goodbye and boarded the plane. General Wei began to say goodbye to the friends of the embassy and the advisory group one by one, and then he took the ambassador's hand and talked in a low voice for a few words. From his expression, one could see sincere gratitude. He walked up the handrail and turned around to wave the grass hat in his hand. Finally, the silver door of the plane, painted with three red stripes, covered his slender back.

At 9:30, the Ninth-Four-One-Four-Nine Constellation special plane, in everyone's farewell waves, slid into the runway. Twenty minutes later, its powerful four propellers shattered the low-pressure clouds and rushed into the clear sky. The people at the airport also dispersed.

"At Daxiaochang Airport, we have welcomed and sent off many people... Each welcome or send-off represents the beginning or end of a stage in politics." But after reading General Wei's sincere and frank departure certificate, we feel that this send-off does not represent the end. From his arrival to his departure, the thirty-three days have just raised the curtain. He told us that what we have to do is "to start anew with the people."

### In Coordination with the General Mobilization Order, the Representatives Conference of Various Provinces and Cities in North China Has Formulated Emergency Measures

[Our Beiping Dispatch on the 24th] The Beiping Pacification Headquarters convened representatives from various provinces and cities for a meeting in recent days, and has formulated an emergency measures plan to coordinate with the general mobilization order, which will be implemented after approval by the central government. The main points are: (1) Strengthen the powers of the Pacification Headquarters, which can conveniently command the subordinate pacification offices, provincial and municipal governments, and central government agencies stationed in the area, and resolve matters locally. (2) In military affairs, strengthen the local armed forces and use corps under the unified command of the Headquarters. (3) Simplify provincial and municipal administrative agencies, and abolish departments such as land and food, society, health, and land administration, as well as redundant agencies. (4) Financially, when necessary, the Headquarters may order state-owned factories and enterprises such as the Changlu Salt Bureau, the Customs and Mining Bureau, and the China Textile Company to pay taxes to make up for the shortfall.

### After Acheson's Death in Plane Crash, Japanese Peace Conference to Be Postponed; U.S. Conducts Diplomatic Offensive Against Soviet Union in China, Japan, and Korea

[Central News Agency Tokyo Dispatch on the 24th] The death of Acheson, chairman of the Allied Council for Japan, will postpone the Japanese peace conference until after November 11, or November. The world is now paying attention to the U.S. Navy's search for top-secret documents regarding the Japanese peace treaty, but the Central News Agency reporter has learned that Acheson himself was the key to solving many problems, and the United States' information on these issues has not yet been finalized. Even the most confidential documents could not include it. Much of the information was given orally. For this reason, the State Department must appoint someone to fill Acheson's position as an unfortunate diplomat whose position in the occupied Japan matters was second only to that of General MacArthur, and the person who succeeds to the position must first learn the information and detailed opinions that the Supreme Authority of the occupation intends to convey to the Washington authorities. Possible successors may be Seabold, deputy chief of the diplomatic branch of the Allied Headquarters who has been acting as proxy for Acheson in the Allied Council for Japan and its service affairs in Japan for the past year, but prestige and experience in the diplomatic field are very important, so other officials in the State Department with diplomatic experience, such as Stanton, the former U.S. Consul General in Shanghai and the current U.S. Minister to Siam, may also be successors. However, Acheson's successor will take at least a month or six weeks to be decided.

[United Press Washington Dispatch on the 24th] According to sources in authority, the aim of the U.S. diplomatic offensive against the Soviet Union is to take the initiative into the hands of the United States. Beginning on the 24th, it has been conducted on the three major fronts of China, Japan, and Korea. The most recent action in this approach was the United States' re-protest to the Soviet Union against the ban on international ships importing into Port Dalian, as seen in. The recent U.S. note to the Soviet Union is the same as the one sent to the Soviet Union on January 3 of this year, with one exception: the United States frankly stated that if the Soviet Union refuses to abide by the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance of August 14, 1945, then the Soviet Union shall be responsible for American property and nationals in Dalian. On the other two fronts, the U.S. diplomatic offensive is aimed at demanding progress from the Soviet-American Joint Commission on Korea and frankly rejecting the Soviet Union's demand that the Japanese peace treaty should be drafted by the four powers.

In mid-September, after Wedemeyer returns to the United States from his investigation of China and other parts of the Far East, the general policy of the United States toward the Chinese National Government is expected to be clarified.

According to authoritative sources, the United States is unlikely to change its China policy and appease the Chinese Communists. The deterioration of US-Soviet relations will inevitably cause unfavorable repercussions for the Chinese Communists.

### Members of the Council for Deliberation on the Japanese Peace Treaty Have Been Appointed

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 24th] The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has established a Council for Deliberation on the Japanese Peace Treaty for the purpose of drafting a Japanese peace treaty. In addition to some senior officials of the Ministry serving as members, experts on Japanese issues outside the Ministry have also been invited to serve. It is reported that letters of appointment have been issued and a meeting will be convened soon to begin work.

### New Military Officer Education: Eight Principles Determined

[Our Nanjing Dispatch on the 24th] According to the Military News Agency, the new military officer education system has been discussed by various relevant units, and eight principles have been determined and will be implemented soon: (1) Improve officers' knowledge of natural science. (2) Cultivate unified commanders and staff for the army, navy, and air force. (3) Pay attention to joint logistics cadre training and establish a unified joint logistics organization. (4) Strengthen specialized technical training so that all scientific developments can be applied to military affairs. (5) Coordinate academic qualifications with age and experience so that knowledge can be applied to teaching. (6) Take into account both experience and academic qualifications, and attach equal importance to staff and field positions. (7) Enforce the enrollment system, eliminate officers layer by layer, in order to select outstanding officers. (8) Appropriately cultivate officers to meet the needs of the mobilization order.

### Pingjinji Supervision Group Determined to Punish Corruption

[Central News Agency Beiping Dispatch on the 24th] The Pingjinji Military Discipline and Official Governance Supervision Group was formally established in Ping on the 24th after extensive preparations by the Beiping Pacification Headquarters, Baoding Pacification Office, and various public opinion organizations. It also held its first State Affairs Meeting and stipulated a work plan, which will begin on the 25th. The person in charge of the group said that they have the greatest determination to punish corruption, and officials found to have committed corruption will be dealt with according to law once they are discovered.

### Party Members Brutally Killed by Communist Bandits; China Harmony Party Cables Request to Punish the Culprits

[Central News Agency this City Dispatch] The China Harmony Party held an emergency meeting on the evening of the 23rd because its Haimen Branch Director Shen Xizhen and General Affairs Section Chief Shi Wenhan were brutally killed by armed Communist personnel. They unanimously passed a resolution to be sent to the National Government, requesting that the culprits be punished to uphold human rights. At the same time, a telegram was sent to Mao Zedong to investigate responsibility.

### Hong Kong - Above Paradise - One of the Southern Travel Jottings -

— Bu Shaofu

A reporter traveled from Shanghai to Beijing on July 23rd to participate in a South China visit with colleagues from Beijing and Shanghai. The group totaled eight people. On the 25th, they flew from Beijing to Hankou. On the afternoon of the 28th, they took the Guangdong-Hankou train to Changsha, arriving on the 29th. They stayed in Changsha for three days, departing for Hengyang on August 1st and arriving on the evening of the 2nd. After spending the night, they left Hengyang the following evening. They stopped in Yingde for four hours and arrived in Guangzhou at 9:00 AM on the 5th. On the 9th, they flew from Guangzhou to Hainan Island, returning on the 12th. On the 14th, they took the Guangzhou-Kowloon train to Hong Kong, returning to Guangzhou on the 19th and flying back to Shanghai on the 21st. This trip lasted a total of 28 days, with footprints across six major cities: Hankou, Changsha, Hengyang, Guangzhou, Haikou, and Hong Kong. Although the journey was hurried and inevitably superficial, there was much to observe that could be used for reference and research. I will now record my personal observations in separate articles below, seeking the guidance of knowledgeable gentlemen at home and abroad.

There is such a joke:

"A British soldier stationed in Hong Kong, after dying, approached Heaven and angrily knocked on the gates. The officer in charge of Heaven opened the door and asked the reason. The British soldier said he wanted to enter Heaven. The officer asked, 'Where do you come from? What do you do?' The British soldier told the truth. The officer said: 'A person like you, in a place like that, why do you still need to enter Heaven?'"

Hong Kong, a place above paradise for British royal personnel, after reading today's reports on the living conditions of the British Isles, we no longer believe this is a joke.

In the two years since the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, Hong Kong has undergone tremendous changes. Ultimately, India is now independent, yet Hong Kong remains a shining jewel in the crown of the British Empire. It is prosperous, with a population of 1.6 million (110,000 more than the highest wartime count). It nourishes the British Empire (silver and bronze subsidiary coins have disappeared, and newly issued paper subsidiary coins are only printed on one side. As for the total amount of Hong Kong dollars issued, who knows?). It is colorful, complex, contradictory, and also bizarre.

After leaving the second floor of Gloucester Building, one can easily encounter people of various identities who cannot gain a foothold in the mainland. Large-scale smuggling organizations are active, and forwarding companies solicit business, allowing one to pay 50% of the cargo price as a guarantee. Fluid capital concentrates, overseas remittances concentrate, building the prosperity of Queen's Road in Hong Kong today.

Colorful, complex, contradictory, and bizarre aspects are reflected in the eye-catching colors of clothing worn by pedestrians on the street, so superficial and easily faded! Reflected in the "Miss Hong Kong" election is the selection of a mother of two children from among four women. Reflected in the collapse of a bank is only the lack of HK$1.5 million in short-term financing. Reflected in the newly opened afternoon newspaper being sold all over the streets at 11:00 AM. Reflected in morality cases where two "throwing girls" are arrested and fined for the crime of "obstruction" (meaning obstructing traffic).

I arrived in Hong Kong on the eve of the Hong Kong Chinese Mechanics Association's strike of the thirteen departments of machine workers. At that time, the Chinese Mechanics Association had issued a final ultimatum, giving the capitalists 24 hours to respond, or else they would strike. At 5:00 PM on the 15th, the deadline of the ultimatum expired, and the action began. One Hong Kong evening newspaper even temporarily published a special edition, using the name "Second Edition" to avoid provoking the situation. People in Hong Kong had long been panicking, filling bathtubs and buckets with water. Rice, firewood, oil, kerosene, and candles were also hoarded in large quantities. They either knew about the Guangzhou-Hong Kong general strike of 1920 or had experienced the taste of falling into enemy hands before 1941. Everyone was clever and alert, fearing the interruption of electricity and water, and prices jumped suddenly. Rice, the "golden coin" Silky Rice, rose to $88 per picul, and gold stocks showed a major downward trend.

However, until the day the reporter left Hong Kong (August 19th), the water, electricity, and transportation workers did not participate. Life in Hong Kong was not fatally suffocated. The weekend dances at the Peninsula Hotel and the waitresses at the Tai Tung Restaurant still attracted Chinese and foreign gentlemen and their soaring excitement. It turned out that the Labor Bureau of the Hong Kong government had its clever plan, and the capitalists of the Kowloon, Navy, and Taikoo Dockyards naturally did not need to be tough.

What is the clever plan to open? That requires investigating the organization and background of various unions in Hong Kong, and why the water, electricity, and transportation unions did not participate in this wage increase campaign. This issue is not simple, and this lack of simplicity may be one of the factors that constitute "above paradise." In short, those who understand the inside story of the ending of the thirteen departments of machine workers' strike will know that it will end in a low amount of payment.

Merchants have their suffering. They are complacent about this golden opportunity before the restriction, but they are even more anxious to seek a path to wealth that cannot be found. Hong Kong is flooded with fluid capital, and bank loans are mostly interest-free, and even depositors have to pay handling fees. The severity of domestic import restrictions and the difficulty of settling foreign exchange force them to feel like they are lying in piles of money, enduring hunger and swallowing saliva. Before our government announced changes to foreign exchange settlement and import-export trade measures on the 17th, overseas Chinese merchants had planned to organize a large-scale operating institution to trade with the mainland, adopting a barter method, hoping to break the paralyzed state of Hong Kong's import and export trade in the past two months. Now that our government has announced the revised measures, and the Sino-Hong Kong financial agreement is also nearing the time of promulgation, Hong Kong's commerce can slightly move into the right track.

Distorted prosperity has its limits. If there is a blockade line between China and Hong Kong, let alone prosperity, even survival would be a big problem. The Hong Kong government knows this very clearly, and our government should not fail to know it clearly either. If our government knows it very clearly, our negotiations on the economic front must abandon "Bund diplomacy" and fill this loophole with reinforced concrete.

On the 13th, the Hong Kong News section of the Sing Tao Daily had this paragraph of news:

"Next to the Tiger Balm Garden in Tai Hang, there is a small stream. The stream water is clear and cold, and children often gather to play. On the morning of the previous day (the 11th), four people dressed as students went to play in the mountain pit. As soon as they were playing, several child bandits robbed the students of their ink pens and money. In the afternoon of the same day, several other students went to play in the area and were again robbed of their valuables by the group of child bandits. The students, unwilling to lose their belongings, resisted slightly and were beaten by the child bandits. They shouted loudly for help, but by the time the police arrived, the child bandits had already fled without a trace." A friend - who has lived in Hong Kong for two years - said to me:

"Although living in Hong Kong is quite comfortable, it always feels like something is missing."

Hong Kong, how do we view it? With what kind of identity do we view it?

### Southern Henan Recovers Runan and Xincai - Remnant Bandits Have Fallen Into the National Army's Pocket-Shaped Encirclement - Western Henan Bandits Cross the River and Invade Luoyang, Martial Law Imposed

[Our Newspaper Xuzhou 24th Dispatch] The remnant troops of the Communist bandit Liu Bocheng in southern Henan have become rats in a sack. The National Army is launching a pincer attack from the north and south to surround and annihilate Liu's bandits. The northern National Army recovered Runan and Xincai on the 23rd, and is pursuing the bandits south of the Ru River. Liu's 1st and 7th Columns launched an attack on Runanbu on the evening of the 23rd, but were repelled by the National Army. The National Army in Yingshang Yang is dividing its forces to suppress and annihilate Liu's 6th Column of bandits in Sanhejian and Huanggang Temple. Liu Bocheng is leading his 2nd and 3rd Columns and is still wandering around the areas of Xinjiu Southeast Island, Majiaji, and Baoji, etc. The Southern National Army is advancing north from Zhenchuan and Gushi. At the moment, the remnant troops of Liu's 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 6th, and 7th Columns have fallen into the National Army's pocket-shaped encirclement in the triangle area of the Ru River and the Huai River.

[Our Newspaper Bengbu 24th Dispatch] The remnant bandits who crossed the river from Sanhejian Cangji, on the 23rd, scurried into Gushi territory. The National Army is following closely behind. The bandits' 1st and 7th Columns scurried to the north bank of the Huai River in southern Henan and divided into several crossing points. One group crossed the river and appears to be heading west towards Xinyang. The Pingzhi Road National Army is on alert.

[Central News Agency Luoyang 24th Dispatch] Luoyang City, in order to consolidate its city defense and maintain public order, announced the imposition of martial law starting from the 23rd.

[Central News Agency Luoyang 24th Dispatch] On the night of the 22nd, Communist bandits simultaneously crossed the river in the areas along the river in Xin'an, Mianchi, and Shanxian in western Henan. The first to cross south was Huijin Town east of Shanzhou. By noon on the 23rd, more than 2,000 bandits had crossed the river and were engaged in fierce fighting with our garrison troops. However, due to the disparity in numbers, both sides suffered casualties. The situation in Huiyuzhen at noon is unclear. Another group of Communist bandits scurried south towards the area south of the Gonglu Road. At the moment, they have already reached Caijiashi. More follow-up troops are crossing the river. The section of the Gonglu Road between Huiyuzhen and Jiaokou has been destroyed, and traffic is obstructed. The city walls of Shanxian are safe and sound as of the evening of the 23rd. The military and civilians have mobilized together. However, the situation regarding the deployment of defenses against bandits is quite tense. Xicangji, west of Mengjin and bordering the river, was captured by bandits on the 22nd. Our water reserve team of 500-600 people rushed to suppress and annihilate them and are currently engaged in fierce fighting. In this forced crossing of the river by bandits, our local troops in Xin'an, Mianchi, and Shanxian fought bravely, despite being outnumbered, to block their advance. Although our civilian army suffered casualties, the Communist bandits also suffered a great blow. By the afternoon of the 23rd, our National Army had arrived in succession and made effective deployments. The Communist bandits who crossed the river will definitely not succeed.

[Our Newspaper Xi'an 24th Dispatch] Several bridges on the Longhai Railway east of the Shanzhou Station, from Zhangjiazhuang to Zixingzhen, have been destroyed. The bus from Xi'an to Luoyang safely returned yesterday. Today, the eastbound train only reaches Lingbao Pass.

[Our Newspaper Taiyuan 23rd Dispatch] Communist bandits are gathering in the area bordering Shanxi and Henan, actively preparing to cross the river and invade Henan. Chen Congying's troops are stationed in Xiaodiantou northwest of Jiyuan. The 10th, 11th, and 13th Brigades and local troops he leads, totaling more than 20,000 people, are stationed in the area around Xiwangzhuang Town in Jiyuan. The 25th, 26th, and 27th Brigades of bandits west of Bo'ai also moved west to the vicinity of Wangwu on the 19th. They have already obtained more than 70,000 sheepskin bags for crossing the river in Jiyuan. Boatmen from various counties along the river in southern Shanxi are being sent to the ferries of Yishi and Yuxiang for training. Carpenters from various counties are also rushing to build boats.

### Three National Army Routes in Jiaodong Advance to the Suburbs of Pingdu City - Remnant Bandits Between Heze and Juye in Western Shandong Are Eliminated

[Our Newspaper Taiyuan 23rd Dispatch] The Battle of Pingdu is the prelude to the Jiaodong campaign. The National Army is advancing from Jimo, Gaomi, and Changi respectively. The progress in the past three days has been extremely cautious. The resistance from the Communist bandits has been weak. The National Army advancing north from Gaomi in the central route captured Tingkou, 50 li north of Gaomi, yesterday. At 9:00 PM that night, they continued to advance 40 li, crossed Hejia Dian, and reached the suburbs of Pingdu City. The Jimo National Army on the right also crossed Liuzhuang and advanced to the suburbs of the city. The Communist bandits reinforced from Gaowang Mountain and engaged in fierce fighting. The fighting is still underway. Gaowang Mountain, Dazhu Mountain, and Juchi Mountain are actually the main bases of the Communist bandits in Jiaodong. If the National Army attacks Pingdu, the gateway to Jiaodong will be wide open.

### Cruel Atrocities of Communist Bandits in the Wuqing and Xianghe Areas

[Central News Agency Tianjin 24th Dispatch] Refugees from Wuqing who came to Tianjin said: The Communist bandits in the Wuqing and Xianghe areas have recently intensified their trampling of the people. The "Farmers' Association," "Women's Association," and "Children's Garden" in each village have all been formed under the direction of the Communist bandits. Villagers with any assets cannot escape struggle. The method of struggle is to drag the person being struggled to a platform made of wooden boards and first make them "confess." Then, the "Children's Garden" beats them painfully with sticks. They are beaten until they are half dead and then sprayed awake with cold water. This is repeated until they are dead. The Children's Garden is composed of children aged seven to sixteen. Usually, when they go out, they each carry a two-foot-long wooden stick, rampage through the countryside, ignore the law, and openly regard themselves as rulers. Human ethics in the bandit area have been completely destroyed. In Hebei Village, Xianghe County, a female member once beat her father-in-law to death with a wooden stick and then beat her aunt to death. No one in the village dared to interfere. The refugee said: If the National Army does not recover the area, he would rather starve to death in a foreign land than return home. He does not want to return to his hometown and suffer the cruel crimes of the Communist bandits.

### Another Upheaval at the China College in Beiping - Students Expel the Secretary-General and the Chief of General Affairs

[Our Newspaper Beiping 24th Dispatch] The private China College in Beiping has experienced another incident. The college has been struggling to become nationalized for years. After the expulsion of Principal He Qi, a school affairs committee was organized, led by Secretary-General Chao Qingchang and Chief of General Affairs Han Daozhi. However, Tan and Han, who led the expulsion of He last time, were suddenly expelled. The Student Union of the China College held a general student meeting last night and announced several crimes of Han Daozhi. Han deposited 1 billion yuan of school funds in a bank and took 40% of the black interest. He also bought gold houses with public funds. When Han exchanged the flour allocated to students by UNRRA, he took 30,000 yuan per bag. Secretary-General Chao Qingchang nominally led the nationalization effort but secretly controlled the school. Professors left one after another due to low salaries. The certificates issued by the acting principal were not valid for applying to judicial organs. The tuition fee was originally set at 200,000 yuan but was suddenly changed to 280,000 yuan. Students who paid late for ten days would be expelled.

### A Discussion of the Provincial Government Reform Plan

— Chu Zirun

Everyone knows the shortcomings of the current provincial administration. Reforming it has become a consistent demand from above and below. The Ministry of Interior's timely submission of the provincial administration reform plan to the Executive Yuan is worthy of our attention. Reviewing the common malpractices of past provincial administrations, there are roughly three: First, the legal status of the province is not defined; second, the organization of the provincial government is complex and its operations are inflexible; and third, provincial finances lack long-term planning and have a weak foundation. Therefore, reforming the provincial administration has become the most pressing issue.

Today, when speaking of provincial administration reform, in my opinion, there are two principles that must be followed: First, prepare for the implementation of constitutional government to lay the foundation for provincial autonomy. Second, implement the "three-linked system" of administration to improve administrative efficiency.

First, prepare for the implementation of constitutional government to lay the foundation for provincial autonomy. The Constitution of the Republic of China, passed by the National Assembly and promulgated by the National Government, has determined the nature of the province in the future as a high-level local self-governing body. Therefore, the key task at hand is how to transform a province that is a central representative body into a province that is locally self-governing. This should not be addressed only after the implementation of the Constitution. During this period, any provincial measures that run counter to the principles of provincial autonomy stipulated in the Constitution must be stopped immediately. Any measures that can lay the foundation for provincial governance after the implementation of the Constitution should be adjusted and implemented early to prepare for the implementation of the Constitution. For example, dividing the administrative institutional systems of the central government and the provinces to respect the status of provincial self-governing bodies; increasing the powers and responsibilities of the provincial chairman to prepare for the implementation of the provincial governor system to achieve administrative unity; downsizing agencies, simplifying structures to concentrate strength, unifying powers, saving expenditures, and promoting government affairs. Relaxing the standards for reviewing provincial budgets and work plans, only requiring that they do not contradict national policies and laws, and do not change their content and direction, to gradually cultivate their self-governing ability, etc.

Second, implement the "three-linked system" of administration to improve administrative efficiency. The purpose of provincial administration reform is nothing more than to empower the people of the province and enable the provincial government. To make the provincial government an all-powerful government and improve administrative efficiency, it is necessary to implement the "three-linked system" of administration. All the principles of the "three-linked system" of administration, such as implementing the system of secretary-general, the system of layered responsibility, the system of graded responsibility, planned politics, and planned economy, must be thoroughly reformed with reference to the guidelines to achieve realization.

The provincial administration reform plan submitted by the Ministry of Interior to the Executive Yuan for review this time (published in the Nanjing Central Daily on August 8) is an important document for reforming local politics. Its contents are divided into five items: dividing systems, defining powers and responsibilities, simplifying institutions, managing personnel, and improving government affairs, all of which are very concise and hit the mark. The symposiums of the provincial chairmen also provided valuable opinions, demonstrating the importance attached by each province. The author has served in provincial administration for more than ten years and would also like to offer a few words based on what I have seen in ordinary times for the consideration of experts.

(A) Dividing Systems. The original plan of the Ministry of Interior stipulates that the central ministries and agencies should address the provincial government when issuing government orders and executing the affairs under their jurisdiction. Except for legal procedures (such as the Director of the Civil Affairs Department being the election supervisor), each ministry is not allowed to correspond directly with departments under the province. This provision was originally intended to respect the provincial government's authority and implement a graded responsibility system, so that government orders can be consistent, and responsibilities can be concentrated, so that the provincial chairman can oversee provincial administration, and the departments can be under the command and control of the provincial chairman, so that there will be no disadvantages as in the past, where each department and the central supervising ministry had their own affiliations and systems of authority, and it was difficult to get rid of the problem of a tail wagging the dog. However, if it is strictly stipulated that each department is not allowed to correspond directly with the central supervising ministry, such as the Ministry of Education not being able to correspond with the Provincial Department of Education, and the Department of Education not being able to correspond directly with the County Bureau of Education, then why is the County Education Section changed to a bureau, and why does the Provincial Government set up departments? If the should be placed in the provincial government, equivalent to the sections of each ministry and the departments of each county government, as internal of the provincial government, and not as independent institutions, is this kind of reform appropriate in today's society where affairs are progressing and government affairs are changing rapidly? Therefore, it is difficult to agree with the rigid stipulation that direct correspondence is not allowed. In fact, purely administrative affairs should be carried out by the order of the Executive Yuan, with the deputy minister of the supervising minister countersigning, or by the supervising ministry addressing the provincial government with a letter, in order to centralize authority. However, matters under the jurisdiction of each ministry, which are purely guidance on methods and techniques, may still be directly corresponded with for convenience. In this way, the graded responsibility system can be implemented, and in addition to the concentration of power, the effect of unobstructed communication and flexible application can be achieved.

(B) Defining Powers and Responsibilities. In accordance with the principle of in the "three-linked system," they should be specified in detail by enumeration so that each department knows its responsibilities. The content is that the chairman of the provincial government exercises his functions and powers on behalf of the provincial government, and each head of department should be subject to his control, in preparation for the future implementation of the provincial governor system. The enumerated points are roughly the same as the "General Rules for Responsible Offices of the Provincial Government" formulated by each province in accordance with the "Principles and Procedures for Each Agency to Exercise Responsibilities" previously promulgated by the Executive Yuan. If they can be implemented as required by law, they will be able to stand at their posts, each bear their own responsibility, cultivate the spirit of automatic independence, establish a model for the democratization of agencies, and lay the foundation for the implementation of government. This is its advantage. However, there is one imperfection: although the period for implementing constitutional government is near, the time for implementing the popular election of provincial governors is still to be determined. During this transition period, the provincial chairman will preside over provincial administration for a considerable period of time, and there should be concrete regulations on the selection criteria for the provincial chairman. "If there is a person, there is governance; if the person is gone, the governance ceases." Whether the provincial chairman is a good person or not is greatly related to the rise and fall of the politics of a province. "Separation of military and civilian affairs" is a consistent call from above and below, and it is easy for the military to hold political power, which may form a situation of separatism. Local areas should have military power, which should become a thing of the past. After ten years of hard struggle in the National Revolution, the situation of local separatism has been tending to disappear. Through the efforts of the military, the military must be nationalized. The responsibility for local pacification should be borne by the national army, and there is no need for the military to serve as chairman at the same time. This is not only the claim of the people of the country, but also the suggestion of General Wedemeyer's special envoy during his visit to China. However, the military account for more than 90% of the current provincial chairmen, and most of them are active officers. The fact that the words "separation of military and civilian affairs" are not mentioned in this reform plan seems to be its biggest shortcoming.

(C) Simplifying Institutions. The original proposal stipulates that the existing institutions should be considered and merged in accordance with the "Revised Provincial Government Organization Law" and the "Provisional Regulations on Joint Office of the Provincial Government" and in light of actual needs. The administrative affairs should be classified and merged into the various departments that should be established according to their nature. The management of the institutions should be changed to the departments that should be in charge. This method is very appropriate in principle to simplify institutions and concentrate power. However, there are two points that should be added to the full text: (1) The institutions originally stipulated for downsizing only refer to the provincial institutions. In my opinion, all institutions established by the central government in the province, whose responsibilities overlap with the functions and powers of the provincial government's departments (such as various tax collection agencies that can be merged into the provincial government's Department of Finance, which are more clearly distinguished), should also be downsized into each department together with their funding. Second, how to downsize institutions cannot be delegated to the province. The province should formulate measures and submit them to the Executive Yuan for approval and implementation. The establishment of provincial institutions is based on laws and regulations, and the provincial government is not suitable for making claims based on its own preferences. Only after the central government decides, it will be implemented by the order of the Executive Yuan. My specific downsizing opinion is that the provincial government should set up four departments: Secretariat, Accounting, Security, and Social Affairs, and four bureaus: Civil Affairs, Finance, Education, and Construction. All other provincial-level administrative institutions should be downsized, and all service institutions should be transformed. The military district headquarters and security headquarters must be parallel to the provincial government; because the Ministry of National Defense is subordinate to the Executive Yuan, the two headquarters can also be subordinate to the provincial government and merged into the Provincial Security Police Department. As for the institutions that each province has established on its own, they should all be downsized, which goes without saying.

(D) Managing Personnel. According to the current "Provincial Government Organization Law," the provincial government chairman concurrently serves as one of the members of the provincial government, and the , such as those of the heads of the Civil Affairs, Finance, Education, and Construction , are concurrently held by the members, which is no different. All of them are appointed by the National Government after being passed by the Council of the Executive Yuan. But in fact, members concurrently serve as heads of , mostly by of the provincial chairman, which has invisibly become a chief officer system. The provincial administration reform is led by the provincial chairman and is responsible to the Executive Yuan, so this power of appointment seems reasonable. But this reform plan stipulates: "The appointment of each shall be formulated by the central government, registration procedures will be established, and qualified candidates will be reserved in advance by each ministry (the Accounting Officer will be handled by the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics). When there is a vacancy, the supervising department will submit two to three people to the Executive Yuan meeting for decision and appointment. Except for the Secretary-General, the provincial government chairman will not be allowed to stay or leave," which aroused the opposition of the provincial chairmen's symposium. But the author agrees with the opinion of the Ministry of Interior that in the future, when constitutional government is implemented, the provincial governor system will be adopted, and the provincial governor will be elected by the people with a fixed term, and there will be no members. The and service institutions below, whether it is the Civil Affairs, Finance, Education, and Construction or the Secretariat, Accounting, Security, and Social Affairs , should all be civil servants; civil servants should not be affected by political turmoil, and should not advance or retreat with the . Therefore, it is appropriate for the central supervising ministry to select specialists and submit them to the Executive Yuan meeting for approval and appointment in order to maintain an all-powerful government. This claim of the Ministry of Interior is not excessive and I express my support. However, the provincial chairman and the future provincial governors should retain the right to impeach the heads of each department with the central government in order to remedy the of no command.

(E) Improving Government Affairs. The original proposal of the Ministry of Interior is divided into five points: (1) The business of the central government in the province should be entrusted to the province in principle; (2) If the work plan does not contradict national policies and laws, the central government should review it without changing its content in principle; (3) Simplify official document procedures; (4) Stipulate that the business expenses should not be too small; (5) Organize and regulations, etc., are all very concise. In the past, the central ministries and agencies often reviewed the work of the provinces too strictly, which showed disrespect for the opinions of the provinces and went against the principle of provincial autonomy. Therefore, it could not be approved in time, and sometimes the province's 36-year plan had not been approved by July of the 26th year, so the plan was equivalent to . In addition, under the office system, the handling of documents is particularly slow. According to Mr. Nai Guang's investigation, a document enters the provincial government and goes through 18 procedures from registration to delivery to the person in charge, and 17 procedures from the person in charge's draft to the chairman's judgment (see The New Theory of Chinese Administration by). It is very necessary to simplify documents.

However, in addition to these five improvements, the author has several supplementary items:

(1) The provincial budget must be approved early. The annual budgets of the provinces are often approved by the central government at the end of the year because it takes time for the central government to seriously review them, so the budget cannot be implemented according to the budget; the work plan must be based on the budget, and the plan cannot be implemented without the budget. Provincial administration is in a state of without a budget or a plan, so how can it be expected to be on the right track? The provincial budget should be divided into two types in the future: one is the budget for entrusted matters, that is, the expenses for implementing matters entrusted by the central government, which should be by the entrusting central agency and be part of the national budget; the other is the budget for autonomous matters, that is, the expenses for handling provincial local autonomous affairs and supervising counties' handling of autonomous affairs, which should be from the province's autonomous tax revenue. Since the budget has been reviewed and approved by its civil , the central of the supervisory agency must be picky, as long as it does not contradict laws and policies, it should be approved before the start of the year. As for how to collect and how to spend, it is all the matter of the autonomous body itself, so in the reform plan, it should be clearly stipulated that the provincial budget must be approved before the start of the year.

The financial rights of autonomous bodies must be respected. The current provincial finances are difficult to , but the central government's lack of respect for the financial rights of the provinces is the main reason. In terms of revenue, it is necessary to seek an appropriate division of tax rights, and in terms of expenditure, it is necessary to strive for savings. The central orders to the provinces are for more than autonomous , but most of the entrusted do not have , and the central must shoulder burden. If the are all by the superior commissioning agency , and the autonomous revenue is all used for autonomous , respecting the autonomous , then the finances of each province will not be as difficult as they are now. Moreover, taking from the people and using it for the people, taking is not and can naturally move towards self-sufficiency, solving the current provincial financial .

(3) The central government's entrusted matters should be limited. The businesses that the central government operates in the province should not set up separate institutions, but should be entrusted to the provincial government to handle them in principle, but they cannot be entrusted in everything without limit. Purely national affairs that should not be entrusted to the provinces should not be entrusted so that provinces can focus on the of the provincial autonomous and the of county autonomy, so that they will not be tired of. As for which can be entrusted and which should be handled by themselves, the provisions of Articles 107 to 110 of the Constitution should be used as .

If the authorities adopt the above opinions and supplement and amend them when reviewing the draft of the provincial administration reform plan of the Ministry of Interior, I believe it will be of some .

### Failure of Foreign Minister of Greece to Form a Cabinet Due to Refusal of Cooperation from the Liberal Party; The United States Takes a Watching Attitude Towards the Greek Political Turmoil

[Reported by this newspaper] London, 24th Broadcasting: The Foreign Minister of Greece, Tsaldaris's today to form a new cabinet has failed. The leader of the Liberal Party, Sophoulis, has refused to join the . The Foreign Minister met with Sophoulis today for an hour, but no result was achieved.

[Reuters Athens, 24th] The King of Greece, Paul, authorized the leader of the People's Party, Tsaldaris, last night to form a new cabinet. Tsaldaris is expected to submit a list of the new cabinet on Monday, and the parliament has also scheduled a meeting on Thursday to listen to the new cabinet's policy guidelines. After accepting the imperial order and leaving the palace yesterday, Tsaldaris said that he would invite all parties, including the Liberal Party, to participate in the new cabinet, and Tsaldaris will also ask the parliament to vote on the new cabinet on Thursday. (Tsaldaris as National)

[Reuters Athens, 23rd] The Greek cabinet resigned today due to internal division, and King Paul convened a meeting of party leaders today in an attempt to resolve the crisis. Among the internal affairs measures that the cabinet discussed yesterday was a proposal to declare the Communist Party illegal, but no resolution was reached. Today, the Deputy Prime Minister of the Liberal Party, Venizelos, the Minister of Interior of the Social Democratic Party, Papandreou, and the Minister of Aviation of the National Unity Party, Kanelopoulos, first announced their resignations, and the cabinet collapsed with them. The Greek cabinet now seems to be divided into two factions, one led by Foreign Minister Tsaldaris, and the other is the three-center party cabinet members who first resigned. Papandreou intends to get his hands on the position of Minister of the Army. American officials here are deeply concerned that if the right-wing People's Party comes to power, it will take radical and strong policies, making the country's weak resources subject to more tense extraction. Some observers expect that there are three possible ways to resolve the crisis: (1) Tsaldaris and his People's Party will form a right-wing government; (2) the People's Party and the Liberal Party will jointly form a "national salvation cabinet"; (3) a personalized government will be formed, with the most prestigious figures in the country, such as Archbishop Damaskinos or General Plastiras, taking the lead. A government led by the People's Party will take extremely repressive policies against the guerrillas, and a coalition government of the Liberal and People's Parties can be expected to take a middle-of-the-road policy and work with parliamentarians to resolve the domestic situation peacefully. However, the opinions of the leader of the Liberal Party, Sophoulis, who is 88 years old, and Tsaldaris, have always been regarded as irreconcilable. As for organizing a transitional personalized government to promulgate an amnesty in preparation for new elections, it is feared that it will be difficult to obtain the support of the parliament.

[United Press International Washington, 23rd] State Department officials informally stated that the fall of the Greek government is an opportunity to organize a more universal cabinet, and the United States does not intend to directly interfere in the reorganization of the new government.

### US Condemns Soviet Satellite States for Supporting Greek Guerrilla Warfare

[United Press International Washington, 24th] The United States has recently accused the three Soviet satellite states, Albania, Bulgaria, and Yugoslavia, of acts of aggression against Greece, and accused the Soviet Union of hindering the Security Council's efforts to prevent aggression. The United States has reiterated its demand for "international action to maintain peace in the Balkans." The United States has specifically condemned the three countries of Albania, Bulgaria, and Yugoslavia for actively supporting guerrilla warfare within Greece amid the resurgence of recent border crossing operations on the Greek border, and said that the three countries have "blatantly and openly refused" to cooperate with the United Nations Investigation Team. The US State Department also issued two reports, describing the investigation by the UN battlefield team in northern Greece on May 20, to support its accusations. The report claimed that the team's work was greatly hampered by the three countries' obstructive tactics. When referring to the Soviet Union, the State Department said, "The Security Council was unable to effectively prevent the aggression of Albania, Bulgaria, and Yugoslavia against Greece due to the Soviet Union's use of its veto power twice on July 29 and August 19." Acting Secretary of State Lovett explained that the US submitted the case to the next UN General Assembly in order to avoid the Soviet Union's use of its veto power in the Security Council.

### Shooting Incidents Occur on Border Between Greece and Bulgaria

The official declined to clarify the UK's response, but informed sources expressed doubts as to whether the UK would be able to comply with the request in the near future, as the British Consul General in Batavia, Mitchison, is about to step down, and the new Consul General, Shepherd, will not be able to take office until the beginning of September. At the same time, the British government is paying close attention to the possibility of a renewed outbreak of widespread war in Indonesia.

### Argentine President Warns Opposition Party: Will Use Action to Force Compliance

[United Press Agency, Argentina Capital, 24th Dispatch] Argentine President Perón, in a welcoming rally for Mrs. Perón's return to the country, warned the opposition that his patience was exhausted, and if the opposition refused to accept his demand for calm, he would force them to comply. Mrs. Perón's visit to Europe lasted two and a half months, and the lavish welcome upon her return was unprecedented in Argentina. Perón declared, "We demand peace, tranquility, and cooperation for the entire world. However, evil forces intentionally conspire to disrupt and slander, causing us to lose our patience and composure." When Perón mentioned the opposition parties, the crowd of one hundred thousand chanted "Hang them!", interrupting the speech for several minutes.

[United Press Agency, London, 23rd Dispatch] Moscow Radio announced today: Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov has replied to U.S. Secretary of State Marshall, saying that the Soviet representative of the U.S.-Soviet Joint Commission on Korea is willing to cooperate in drafting a working report so that the two governments can immediately discuss various steps to achieve the goals of the Moscow Agreement.

[United Press Agency, London, 24th Dispatch] Moscow Radio broadcast Molotov's reply to Marshall, stating that the Soviet Union only agrees to consult with political parties and organizations that support the Korean section of the Moscow Agreement. Molotov mentioned that the U.S. and the Soviet Union decided at the Moscow Conference to temporarily divide Korea into two occupation zones, with a period of trusteeship before establishing a free Korean government. Molotov stated that the Soviet government believes that government organizations that oppose the Moscow resolution cannot be consulted, and it is only possible if they withdraw from the aforementioned committee. Otherwise, these parties cannot participate in the consultations. He also stated that the Soviet government believes that consultations should be held with parties with more than 10,000 members, but recently, parties and organizations in southern Korea that support the Moscow Agreement have been subject to severe restrictions and persecution by the U.S. authorities, which violates democratic principles and the decisions of the Moscow Conference.

### Informal Agreement Reached Between Britain and the U.S. on Amending Article 9 of the Loan Agreement; Fiscal Conference Comes to an End

[Reuters, Washington, 23rd Dispatch] The head of the British financial delegation, Sir Wilfrid Eady, has reached an informal agreement with U.S. officials on amending Article 9 of the Anglo-American Loan Agreement, which prohibits discrimination. This is the second major result achieved in this round of talks, following the agreement to suspend convertibility under Article 8 of the Loan Agreement concerning the acceptance of the pound sterling.

The Anglo-American financial conference has now come to an end, and Sir Wilfrid Eady and the Deputy Governor of the Bank of England, Cobbold, are scheduled to leave the U.S. tomorrow to return to London to report on the progress of the conference and discuss policies to be adopted based on the agreement. Article 9 of the Anglo-American Loan Agreement restricts Britain from purchasing goods from the Sterling Area to prevent discrimination against imports from the Dollar Area. The agreement reached by both parties is essentially informal and requires technical discussion to formally amend the provisions of the loan agreement without having to go through the U.S. Congress. The result could enable Britain to further reduce purchases from the U.S. and switch to purchasing similar goods from the British Empire and the Sterling Area. After returning to London, Sir Wilfrid Eady will meet with key cabinet members to formulate a plan for balancing Britain's international payments, in preparation for the resumption of discussions by senior officials from both countries.

[United Press Agency, Washington, 23rd Dispatch] The British government may, within two months, request the United States to continue amending the $3.75 billion loan agreement.

### French-Czech Alliance Treaty Expected to be Signed Within Months

[United Press Agency, Rome, 23rd Dispatch] Since the Soviet Union rejected Italy's participation in the United Nations, and the Italian government has been able to implement a stable economic policy in domestic affairs in a timely manner, resulting in increased government credibility and a decline in the power of the Italian Communist Party, political observers believe that neutralists and liberals generally consider the Soviet action to be "clearly unfriendly." Coupled with Italian Prime Minister de Gasperi's request for an additional $350 million in loans from the U.S., these two factors have caused Italy, which claims to be impartial, to lean towards the Western European bloc.

### Does the United Nations Need the Soviet Union?

— Special Translation by This Newspaper's Translation Department

Recently, people have often talked about this question: If the Soviet Union, one of the five powers, does not obstruct from the sidelines, will the United Nations be successful? This situation may continue to evolve, and is there a remedy? This question is gradually becoming urgent and attracting people's attention. The purpose of this article is to provide a simple analysis of this question.

Two Paths to Take

People who are most disappointed with the United Nations often say: We have no way to cooperate with the Soviet Union, nor do we have a way to remove it. They cite the Soviet Union's past actions and its uniform veto power. However, if the Soviet Union obstructs all efforts of the United Nations, and the other member states want to continue to pursue the two goals of the United Nations—security and progress—there are only two paths to take:

First, non-Soviet member states can fully exploit the capabilities of the United Nations that the Soviet Union cannot interfere with. Secondly, if this path does not work, they can collectively withdraw from the United Nations and establish a similar organization without allowing the Soviet Union to join.

The First Path The first path—that is, exploiting the functions of the current United Nations organization regardless of Soviet opposition—requires understanding the organization's goals, strengths, and limitations. Everyone knows that the goals of the United Nations are world peace, security, and progress, but few people know its strengths and limitations. Those familiar with the United Nations Charter acknowledge that the United Nations can only maintain peace and security with the cooperation of major powers. The United Nations is not an organization that inherently has the power to promote peace; it cannot suppress the five powers with veto power, and even without veto power, it cannot overwhelm the United States or the Soviet Union.

Therefore, the Soviet Union's strategy of obstructing from the sidelines has not really taken away the United Nations' ability to maintain peace, because this ability has never existed. The Soviet Union's opposition only hinders international cooperation that could promote world peace.

In theory, the Soviet Union's ability to obstruct the United Nations is limited to the handling of major issues in the Security Council, where it has veto power. As for the United Nations General Assembly, the International Court of Justice, the Trusteeship Council, the Economic and Social Council, or subordinate agencies, the Soviet Union does not have veto power. In practice, although the Soviet Union can delay or hinder the discussion process of the aforementioned agencies, it ultimately cannot prevent the majority of member states from deciding on the final steps.

Therefore, on the surface, in many situations, if the majority of member states adopt a firm stance, limit and accelerate the progress of discussions, they may be able to overcome the Soviet Union's policy of procrastination. In such situations, neither abstentions nor veto power are effective, and if the United Nations is determined, it can perform its duties regardless of the Soviet Union.

But what can be done within the scope of the executive actions of the Security Council, which has veto power, regardless of Soviet opposition?

The United Nations Charter provides for "regional arrangements" to deal with security issues suitable for regional action and recognizes the right of member states to individual or collective self-defense in the event of armed attack before the Security Council takes action. Regarding the two terms "regional" and "arrangements," there are no restrictions other than the requirement that they must comply with the principles of the United Nations, and no approval from the Security Council is required.

However, "regional" executive actions, except in cases of compliance with "armed attack," must be approved by the Security Council. In such situations, "regional" defense measures can be taken before the Security Council takes the necessary steps to maintain peace.

Therefore, in the state of continued non-cooperation by the Soviet Union, it seems feasible for member states outside the Soviet bloc to organize a "regional organization" to achieve the security measures that the United Nations can obtain, and if necessary, use the veto power to prevent interference from the Security Council.

If non-Soviet countries join, if they guarantee that all resources are used for collective defense, and if they agree to treat evidence of planned aggression as "armed attack," then such a "regional" arrangement can achieve maximum effectiveness.

The Second Path

If the Soviet Union continues to obstruct the work or development of the United Nations, then the second path can be taken, which is: non-Soviet countries collectively withdraw from the United Nations and establish a new organization, and unless Soviet countries are willing to cooperate, they will not be allowed to join.

Advantages and Disadvantages

Assuming that the new organization, like the regional arrangement, has the same countries and provides the same resources, in terms of security, this plan has several advantages: First, it is not limited to defense against "armed attack"; second, it does not need to use the veto power to transfer the important tasks of the Security Council to regional groups; third, it has all the advantages of an organization composed of non-Soviet countries with righteous goals, whose purpose is to deal with their own problems and prevent aggression by the Soviet bloc.

For the United Nations' tasks and activities that the Soviet Union can only delay but not prevent, the new organization can act more quickly and effectively. The new charter can improve on the old one. But on the other hand, many activities, such as the activities of the United Nations General Assembly, the Economic and Social Council, and the International Court of Justice, are valuable precisely because of their universality. This disadvantage somewhat offsets the advantages of greater effectiveness.

Careful Consideration Required

However, before non-Soviet countries consider collectively withdrawing from the United Nations, there are several factors that must be considered. The United Nations organization is the largest and most extensive effort of mankind to abolish war and promote a secure and progressive world. If nearly forty countries withdraw from the United Nations at the same time, it is tantamount to admitting that this effort has failed, and they are unwilling to easily bear this responsibility until the last step.

### First-Run Cinema Labor Strike: Agreement Reached to Resume Work Last Night; 60,000 Million Yuan Lost in One Day; Expected to Resume Screenings Today

[This Newspaper Report] All 15 first-run cinemas in the city were closed yesterday due to a strike by members of the Second Branch of the Cinema Industry Workers' Union. The second, third, and fourth-run cinemas were not affected and continued to operate as usual, but a few workers had a "lazy work" phenomenon. The Social Bureau convened labor and management all day yesterday to mediate, and an agreement was reached at 7:00 p.m. It was originally scheduled to resume screenings with the 9:15 p.m. show, but it was unable to be screened due to a temporary lack of notification. If there are no changes this morning, all first-run cinemas are expected to fully resume screenings this afternoon.

According to estimates from relevant parties, the city government's entertainment tax revenue lost 100 million yuan due to the strike of workers in the first-run cinemas, while the cinemas lost more than 500 million yuan.

Mayor Wu and Director Wu of the Social Bureau were furious when they learned of the strike of workers in various first-run cinemas the night before, believing that causing such a serious situation due to a dispute at the Majestic Cinema was a violation of the General Mobilization Order and affected social order. In addition to ordering the Labor Division of the Social Bureau to mediate in accordance with the law, he also ordered that cinema workers be immediately informed to resume work.

Cinema Industry Association's Four Demands

The Cinema Industry Business Association held an emergency meeting at 10:00 a.m. yesterday to discuss countermeasures. During the meeting, Chairman Liang Qitian stated that he was very sorry that the dispute at his Majestic Cinema had affected other cinemas. He immediately offered his resignation. The association continued its meeting at 3:00 p.m. and resolved four items: (1) The workers should unconditionally resume work before the Social Bureau conducts a trial mediation. (2) According to the Trade Union Law, the trade union cannot force employers to hire workers introduced by it. The responsibility for this labor unrest lies with the labor side. The cinemas were forced to close. Therefore, they demand to retain the right to claim damages for the losses suffered by the various cinemas due to the illegal employment of workers by the Second Branch of the Cinema Industry Workers' Union. (3) They demand that the authorities severely punish those who instigated this labor unrest. (4) Wages for the period of the workers' strike will be deducted across the board.

### Workers Patiently Await Mediation

Yesterday, many workers from the various Paramount Pictures theaters gathered at the second branch of the labor union, patiently awaiting mediation by the Bureau of Social Affairs. The union demanded adherence to the previously established written record, stating that "when hiring additional staff, priority should be given to hiring unemployed members registered with the union." They believed that the Majestic Theater should dismiss the three female ushers it had hired who were not union members. The management, however, argued that most unemployed members had been dismissed by the management for misconduct. The three female ticket takers hired by the Majestic were introduced by the theater's board of directors, who had the right to advise on the theater's personnel matters.

### Three Ticket Takers Temporarily Suspended

Shen Ding, Director of the Labor Department of the Bureau of Social Affairs, along with Fan Zhenbang, Chief of the Mediation Section, Gu Ruofeng, Deputy Chief, and Zhu Guilin, spent the entire day at the bureau yesterday to mediate this dispute. Shui Xiangyun and Fang Rusheng from the General Labor Union, and Huang Zuoxin and Qian Dayou from the Criminal Division of the Police Bureau also assisted in the mediation. Mayor Wu telephoned Director Shen twice in the morning, urging a swift resolution. After Director Shen and others summoned representatives from both labor and management for mediation, the workers agreed to resume work first by 4:30 PM. However, the management, feeling unprotected, refused to resume business. By 7:00 PM, it was finally agreed that the three female ticket takers hired by the Majestic Theater would be temporarily suspended, pending legal handling by the Bureau of Social Affairs. Regarding the labor's claim that the management had breached the contract and the management's denial of any breach, the Bureau of Social Affairs would convene a mediation based on the written record and facts to make a decision. The workers resumed work at 9:15 PM that evening, but the screening could not proceed because the projectionist and senior theater staff had not been notified in advance. That night, the Bureau of Social Affairs instructed the labor union to order all theater workers to unconditionally resume work first, and also instructed the trade association to notify the three female ticket takers hired by the Majestic Theater to temporarily suspend their services and await mediation. Director Shen and others immediately telegraphed Mayor Wu and Director Wu the progress of the mediation that night.

### Disagreement Unresolved

However, according to the trade association late last night, in order to ensure practical protection in the future, the cinema industry put forward four demands, one of which was the unconditional resumption of work by the workers. The association noted that the Bureau of Social Affairs' notification to the three ticket takers at the Majestic Theater to suspend their services still constituted a "conditional" arrangement. The association argued that the qualifications and abilities of the three ticket takers were all appropriate, and they had not violated any laws. Therefore, the authorities had no reason to instruct the theater to notify them to suspend their services.

### Rumors of a "Kidney Harvesters Gang" Spark Panic, Leading to a Fatal Incident on the Suzhou Creek: Boatmen Beaten to Death, Two Injured; Seventeen Suspects Arrested and Investigated

[Reported by This Newspaper] Recently, bizarre rumors have suddenly spread throughout the city, claiming the emergence of "child-snatching gangs" and "kidney harvesting gangs." Ignorant citizens widely believe these rumors, causing widespread panic and significantly affecting public order. Several days ago, in Yangsi Township in Pudong and near Gaochang Temple in the Nanshi area, the aforementioned rumors led to two tragic incidents of women being mistakenly attacked, resulting in one death and one injury. Yesterday morning, a similar tragic incident occurred in the Suzhou Creek in the central district. Upon receiving the report, Wu Kexiao, the director of the responsible water police sub-bureau, and Song Bingzheng, the section chief, immediately led a large number of police officers to investigate. The investigation revealed that two sampan boatmen, a boat owner and his companion, had been beaten to death and injured, respectively. Seventeen ignorant boatmen were arrested at the scene for assault.

Wrongfully Beaten; Pleas for Help Unanswered

It is reported that before the incident, boatmen in the vicinity had heard rumors of three so-called "kidney harvesting gang" members passing by in a small boat, causing widespread panic. Around 3:00 AM yesterday morning, while it was still dark, boatman Zhou Changqing and his companion, "Little Fool," were traveling west to east along the river from Caojiadu in a sampan. Unfortunately, upon passing through the area, they were mistaken by nearby boatmen and stopped for questioning. Despite Zhou presenting his water district guarantee and city identification, the boatmen ignored them. As the two sides were arguing, someone suddenly shouted "Hit them!" The other boatmen, without hesitation, rushed forward and violently assaulted Zhou and his companion. Zhou and his companion cried for help, but no one answered.

Only Heard Rumors; Did Not Witness Anything

The responsible water police sub-bureau received a report and rushed to the scene, inquiring about the cause of the incident. They rescued Zhou and his companion. At that time, Zhou had lost consciousness and was rushed to Gongji Hospital for treatment, but "Little Fool" had already been beaten to death. The police arrested Chen Ruiting, Liu Ruigou, Xu Caiyou, Wu Youren, Cao Shanzhi, Chen Changgui, Ma Xuecheng, Yao Baoxing, Zhu Tingzai, Shi Xianglang, Sha Guanchen, Pu Qilin, Yang Qilang, Zhu Yonglin, Deng Fugen, Wei Fujin, and Li Defa, a total of seventeen people, and took them to the sub-bureau for investigation. According to the defendants' confessions, they had only heard rumors about the emergence of the "kidney harvesting gang" but had not witnessed anything themselves. When they heard someone shout "Hit them!", they acted impulsively and joined the assault, resulting in the tragic death. The water police sub-bureau is currently continuing a thorough investigation.

### Assistance Fund for Families of Martyred Journalists to be Distributed on September 1st, Journalist Day

In celebration of September 1st, Journalist Day, and to commemorate journalists who died during the War of Resistance, this newspaper launched a fundraising campaign on the 20th of last month to "Raise Assistance Funds for the Families of Martyred Journalists in Shanghai" from all sectors of society.

### Pudong Seawall Project Can Be Completed Before the Autumn Floods

[Reported by This Newspaper] The Pudong Seawall starts from Wusong in the north and extends to Chuansha in the south, with the Gaogiao seaside bathing beach as the midpoint, divided into north and south sections. It was severely damaged during the War of Resistance. Since the Public Works Bureau actively began repairs, the South Seawall project has been restored, costing 1.5 billion yuan. On the North Seawall, the breaches have gradually widened due to the impact of wind and waves over the past year. A budget of approximately 4.1 billion yuan was prepared in April of this year, but the municipal treasury could not afford it. The municipal treasury first advanced 2.1 billion yuan to begin the project, dividing the Shenjiazai breach, Wujiazai breach, and Wujiawan breach into three sections. The second and third sections of the project are expected to be completed by the end of August. The first section, the Wujiazai breach project, is particularly difficult but is expected to be completed before the autumn floods. Furthermore, the full funding for the North Seawall project has been submitted by the Public Works Bureau to the National Water Conservancy Conference and approved, requesting the Executive Yuan to promptly allocate 4.1 billion yuan in assistance.

### A Near-Tragedy at the Penglai Market: Thugs Lurk, Preparing for a Showdown

[Reported by This Newspaper] At around 11:00 PM the night before last at the Southern Theater in the Penglai Market in the Nanshi area, a large number of traffic police from the Ministry of Communications clashed with theater staff. Fortunately, the headquarters of the Military Police was nearby, and a large contingent of military police rushed to suppress the situation. They took several traffic police and theater staff to the headquarters for mediation before letting them return. Fearing retaliation, the theater gathered five or sixty gangsters from the Guangdong Road and Mantingfang areas yesterday and stocked weapons such as knives and iron rods. They planned to ambush the traffic police who came in the evening and settle the score. Sun Hao, a staff member of the Penglai Police Station, learned of the plan and reported it to Director Yao of the branch bureau, who immediately ordered armed police officers to surround the theater. The gangsters fled in fear of punishment. Wang Zaiqing, Xie Yunfang, and staff members Zhou Yimin, Yang Deqing, Li Shanliang, and Si Changlin were arrested, and weapons such as broadswords, iron rods, and iron forks were found inside the theater. They were all taken to the station for investigation. It is reported that the theater lacks responsible personnel and will likely suspend performances today.

### Broadcast by Two Railway Bureau Directors, Chen Bozhuang, on "Overview of Passenger Transport in the Jinghu Area"; Peak Passenger Traffic Reached 3 Million People Per Day

[Reported by This Newspaper] This newspaper held its 21st Sunday special broadcast at the Amerlin Radio Station yesterday, inviting Chen Bozhuang, director of both the Jinpu and Huhang Railway Bureaus, to speak on "Overview of Passenger Transport in the Jinpu Area." A summary of his speech is recorded below:

The railways under the jurisdiction of the current Jinpu Area Railway Administration are the former Jinpu and Huhang railways, commonly referred to as the Two Lines. I believe that what society is most concerned about regarding the Two Lines is their passenger transport. We have not yet been able to resolve the congestion of passenger transport, which we deeply regret. The takeover of the Jinpu Area Railway began on October 1st of the year before last, and it has been 22 months, almost two years. During these two years, traffic on the Two Lines has never been interrupted. Although traffic accidents are inevitable and temporary line blockages occur, this is the case for any railway.

Need to Replenish Eighty Cars

At the time of the takeover, we only had 190 passenger cars. Now, we have increased that to 483. In terms of seating, the Jinpu Line had 10,000 seats at the time of the takeover, and now it has been increased to 32,000 seats. The Huhang Line had 4,000 seats at the time of the takeover, and now it has been increased to 13,000 seats. The combined number of seats on both lines is 45,000. However, according to our passenger transport situation, we need approximately 50,000 seats in total to relieve passenger transport congestion. This difference of 5,000 seats is the most important problem that we are actively trying to solve. Over the past two years, our method of increasing passenger cars has been to transform freight cars into passenger cars. At the same time, we have ordered some cars from the United States. These American cars are just old cars. After the war, all countries need to replenish their own railway cars, so no new cars can be exported within two years. Now, I only need to replenish eighty more cars to relieve passenger transport congestion. You may not know that the number of passengers on this line now has greatly increased compared to before the war. Before the war, the average daily passenger traffic on the Two Lines was only 1.4 million people, but since the recovery, the peak passenger traffic has reached over 3 million people, and the average is always around 2.3 to 2.4 million. The transportation task we are shouldering is indeed much greater than before the war!

Many Difficulties in Laying Double Tracks

The general perception of society is that the Jinpu Line should lay double tracks. It is true that the Jinpu Line, which connects the capital with Shanghai, the center of industry and commerce, is qualified to lay double tracks in the near future. But in terms of current needs, we do not need to make such extravagant demands. If double tracks can be laid between Wuxi and Shanghai, the transportation difficulties of the Jinpu Line will be completely resolved. Because the current highest traffic density is between Shanghai and Wuxi, reaching 40 times every 24 hours. Although it has not yet reached the saturation point for single-track traffic, it has already caused many difficulties in scheduling and the punctuality of trains. However, in terms of current financial resources, we do not dare to harbor such extravagant hopes. In addition to this, we hope to install a CTC electrical centralized control traffic system on the other hand. This is the most economical and effective way to increase the capacity of single-track traffic, allowing trains traveling in the same direction between two stations to follow each other, increasing from one train to two or three trains.

High-Speed Trains Require Huge Costs

You must remember the high-speed trains before the war, which could reach between Jinpu in five hours. Indeed, this is an urgent need of society. But to run high-speed trains, we must replace all 470,000 sleepers and all the steel rails. But sleepers and steel rails must come from abroad, which requires foreign exchange, and the amount of money required is really large. This depends on the government's decision and the assistance of friendly countries, whether this can be realized. Solely based on the railway bureau's own financial resources, such a huge investment is impossible.

### Special Broadcast Program

[Report from our Newspaper] Our newspaper held its twenty-first Sunday all-day special broadcast yesterday at the Amerland Radio Station. In addition to inviting the two Bureau Chiefs, Chen Bozhuang, to speak on "The General Situation of Passenger Transport on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway," the entire day's program is recorded below: Starting at 9:00 AM, Dr. Zhong Zhihe lectured on medicine, and Mr. Zhao Jingshen lectured on "How to Appreciate Kunqu Opera." Starting at 1:00 PM in the afternoon, the Lele Friendship Association performed songs, Miss Bao Hanying told children's stories, Shi Renwang led a harmonica ensemble, Lawyer Mi Xitong lectured on law, Dr. Wang Juerong lectured on "Several Common Infectious Diseases in Children," and Fan Fengyuan lectured on "What is Radio?" From 7:00 to 9:00 PM, members of the Jinglun Quzhuang Society of Kunshan were specially invited to broadcast and sing five excerpts of Kunqu opera, including Chen Zhaobang and Yu Hanping's *Linked Plots* (Questioning and Reconnaissance), Lu Zhengwen's *West Chamber* (Playing with the Letter), Lu Jingmin's *Treasure Sword* (Night Flight), Pan Shaoyi, Tao Bohe, Hu Kun, and Chen Zhongfu's *Searching for Relatives* (Tea Visit), and Hu Jingan and Tao Bohe's *Shepherd's Tale* (Yearning for Home). Having Kunshan natives sing Kunqu opera is naturally different from others. From 9:00 to 12:00 PM, famous local amateur and professional Peking opera singers were specially invited to broadcast Peking opera, including Liang Xiaohong's *Daiyu Burying Flowers*, Li Pengfei's *Stealing the Horse*, Xiong Songquan's *Seven Star Lamp*, Miss Wu Husheng's *Life and Death Hate*, Miss Yuan Yun's *Phoenix Returns Home* (Complete Play), Wu Jiangfeng's *String of Pearls*, Chen Dezhen's *Sending the Son*, and finally, Chen Dahuo and Miss Jin Suqin's duet *Three Mothers Teaching the Son* (Complete Play). Both of them are highly regarded in the opera world. Their collaboration as *sheng* and *dan* for our newspaper's broadcast, with their exquisite artistry, gained much appreciation from the audience. It is worth noting that Miss Jin just returned to Shanghai from the rear after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, and this broadcast was her first time, which is especially commendable.

### Wu Zhihui in Wuxi Discusses War and Conscription The United States Will Inevitably Increase Aid to China Striving to Improve Life in a Difficult Situation

[Report from our newspaper in Wuxi on the 23rd] Mr. Wu Zhihui, a veteran of the Party and the country, came to Wuxi the day before yesterday to visit the families of Kang and Sun. At 6:00 PM last night, he hosted a banquet at the Yingchun Garden on Guanqian Street for local government officials and leaders from various fields. During the banquet, Elder Wu spoke extensively about General Wedemeyer's visit to China, the bandit warfare in the county, the future of China, and his views on elections, constitutionalism, and conscription, covering a wide range of topics, both past and present, with great enthusiasm.

Elder Wu said that since President Truman sent General Wedemeyer to China, the Chinese people have hoped that the United States will increase its aid to China as a result of his visit. He believes that this expectation is not incompatible with the situation, because some Americans believe that the current suppression of unrest in China is a civil war, and even many Chinese people mistakenly believe it to be a civil war. In fact, this war is by no means a struggle between Chiang Kai-shek and Mao Zedong for personal gain. The government has always been tolerant of the Communist Party. The Communist Party has initiated all wars in various regions. If we continue to be tolerant, it would be tantamount to letting Mao Zedong rule the entire China. Therefore, this war is actually a war of political systems, not a struggle for power between individuals or factions. If the Chinese people welcome the Communist Party's rule, then this war is not only a civil war but also completely unnecessary. The United States is completely different from the Soviet Union in terms of ideology and political system. If China is ruled by the Communist Party, it would be very unfavorable to the United States. Now, the Americans do not want China to become a Communist-ruled world, but on the other hand, they consider China's suppression of unrest as a civil war, which is a great contradiction. As for the criticism that China's politics are corrupt and that corruption is rampant throughout the country, and that the United States does not provide convenience for American merchants in China in terms of trade, using this as a reason to oppose aid to China is no different from some people in the country who hope for peace on the one hand and are single-mindedly distressed by political corruption on the other. The prevalence of political corruption is caused by the war. If the war is not quelled, the government will have to devote all its efforts to dealing with the war, and it will not have time to take care of the cleanliness of the household. Mere criticism is greatly inappropriate for the Chinese people and is superficial for the Americans. The US authorities should weigh the pros and cons, and their views should be different from this. In short, even if China is a cat's paw, taking chestnuts out of the fire for the Americans, the claws must be slightly oiled and cleaned to avoid burning the claws in the fire before getting the chestnuts. This is a clear principle. Therefore, the United States will inevitably increase its aid to China in the future, even if there are some twists and turns.

Elder Wu then discussed the trend of suppressing the unrest and the time limit for ending the war and restoring peace, saying: Some people think that the strength of the National Army is gradually weakening, which is absolutely not true. As for the Communist Army appearing to have a stronger trend, it is at most only obtaining some fresh troops from the Soviet Union. However, the Americans should be aware that the Soviet Union is concentrating all its efforts and does not want to lightly expend its strength in the next ten years (at least five years). Therefore, the Third World War will definitely not break out in the next five to ten years, and the Communist Party will definitely not be able to obtain a large amount of foreign aid. The completion of the suppression of the unrest, if it is smooth and stable without unexpected incidents, has the possibility of coming to an end. However, war is most likely to cause unexpected changes, especially with complex international relations, which can cause even more changes. Therefore, the world will have to wait for the war to be quelled and after many years of consolidation before it can be peaceful.

### Qingdao's Flower Industry Donates 20 Million to Support the Troops and Disaster Relief

[Report from our newspaper in Qingdao on the 24th] The 202 households in Qingdao's flower industry, under the name of the Shuju Friendship Association, donated 21,620,000 yuan this morning to support the troops and provide relief to refugees and displaced students.

Elder Wu mentioned that Mr. Luce, the publisher of American magazines such as "Life," "Fortune," and "Time," once wrote that China currently has four major problems: (1) too many illiterates, (2) corruption, (3) decadence, and (4) hypocrisy, only knowing how to beautify the facade. However, these are not worth worrying about. In the Elizabethan era in England and the era of Louis XIV in France, these four problems were also rampant. Later, with the rise of industry and the change in social economy, these four problems were swept away. Among the countries in the world, only Japan is poor and clean, without rampant four problems. Other than that, they are all the same. Currently, China is living in a difficult situation between the two major powers, the United States and the Soviet Union, and it is naturally difficult to get rid of poverty. However, living in a difficult situation is better than being ruled by a single powerful force. The United States is now our friend, but if MacArthur is stationed in Peiping one day, then the American Skytroopers will often visit our heads. Otherwise, we can only live in a difficult situation and strive to improve as much as possible and work hard to produce. This is what we can do and should do.

Elder Wu said that he would not participate in the election this time. Regarding the conscription issue, he said that conscription is not a foreign concept. From the land tax, we can see that conscription was already in place in the past, but recruitment is not bad either. The people of Shandong and Henan provinces are happy to be soldiers, while the people of Jiangsu are not used to it. However, conscription has already been implemented during the current period of unrest.

Finally, Elder Wu discussed four things in the world: First, morality, which is the path that everyone should follow. Because everyone's position is different, their views on morality are also different. Second, economics, and third, politics, which should be regulated between morality and economics. Finally, there is desire, which often troubles mankind and is suppressed by the first three. If the environment is poor, then desires cannot be achieved, and morality and politics lose their power. Therefore, improving the economic environment is the most important thing, and the only way to improve it is through science. Mencius once said, "Those who ask for water and fire from their neighbors in the dark of night, making all things as cheap as water and fire, then there will be no unkind people in the world." Water and fire are produced by nature and are the cheapest. If we can use the power of science to make all things as cheap as water and fire, then the world will naturally be peaceful, morality will not matter, and politics will not be needed. Therefore, it is urgent to use the power of science to improve the environment.

### The Final Project of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Was Successfully Repaired and Tested Yesterday

### Wuyuan Agricultural Loan Tea Fair to be Completed Next Month

[Report from our newspaper in Wuyuan on the 21st] In recent years, the foreign tea industry has declined, and the rural economy relies heavily on the income from wood, paper, and tung oil. The Wuyuan agricultural loan to middle-class farmers includes tea, wood, tung oil, and paper, which are the objects of lending.

This year, the agricultural loan office stationed in Wuyuan first approved tea loans. The total amount of raw tea in the county this year is 8,000 dan. There are 34 tea merchants who received loans, with the largest loan being 1,000 dan, accounting for one-eighth of the total. The first phase of processing loans amounted to 1.36 billion yuan, and the second phase of transportation loans amounted to 420,000 yuan per dan. After deducting the 170,000 yuan for processing loans, the actual amount issued was 250,000 yuan. Based on the total amount of 8,000 dan of raw tea, the total amount was 2 billion yuan. These loans have been issued one after another in recent days.

As for loans for wood, paper, and tung oil, each merchant has not yet registered. The bank is encouraged by the government to export tung oil, and tung oil loans in the county should be held urgently. Wood and paper are related to inter-provincial trade, and support for their development should not be ignored. Once the tea loans are completed, the tung oil and paper loans will be continued. The tea loan period can be completed in September of this year. At this time, tung oil will be newly produced, and wood and paper will be in the peak sales season in winter. Taking advantage of the time to hold agricultural loans will benefit both the bank and the merchants. (Ning)

### The Minqiao Economic Construction Company Took Over the Fuzhou Public Bus Investment and Immediately Caused Disputes

[Report from our newspaper in Fuzhou on the 20th] The Minqiao Economic Construction Company, which has been in preparation for more than a year, was established in Xiamen on July 12 this year. Dozens of overseas Chinese leaders from various ports in Southeast Asia attended, making it a grand occasion. It is understood that the company's future business policy will focus on developing mines in Fujian Province and smoothing traffic within and between provinces. The first investment target of the company is the Fuzhou Public Bus Company.

The public buses in and outside Fuzhou City were originally organized by the joint venture of the Fuxing and Fuxia bus companies. However, due to the shortage of funds, the company was not only unable to purchase new buses, but also had difficulty in replenishing ships and materials. Moreover, disputes between shareholders occurred from time to time, which greatly affected the business. Therefore, the company applied to the Construction Department for permission to send personnel to invite the Minqiao Economic Construction Company to cooperate in investment. Later, during the establishment of the Economic Construction Company in Xiamen, the Construction Department and the joint venture both sent representatives to Xiamen to negotiate with the Economic Construction Company several times. The company agreed and sent Vice Chairman Wang Zhenxiang and senior staff member Huang Chonghan to Fuzhou a dozen days ago to negotiate investment cooperation. The result of the agreement between the two parties was: Economic Construction invested 400 million yuan, together with the assets of the original joint venture of the Fuxia and Fuxing companies, plus the investment in the Fuxingquan Bus Company, which was valued at approximately 500 million yuan. This total of 900 million yuan was the total share capital of the new company, which was established as the "Jingjian Fuzhou Public Bus Company," with Ding Chaowu, Speaker of the Fujian Provincial Assembly, as Chairman and Huang Chonghan, representative of Jingjian, as General Manager. Unexpectedly, this reorganization caused dissatisfaction among some shareholders and employees. For example, shareholder Lin Deqiu and others hired lawyer Chen Linying to publish a protest, stating that this reorganization had not convened a shareholders' meeting to obtain the consent of all shareholders, which was a monopoly by a few people that infringed on the legitimate rights and interests of the majority of shareholders and would be sued according to law. The employees believed that the employee welfare issues had not been resolved and that the reorganization should not be carried out hastily. They also asked lawyers Chen Dengying and Hou Guangdi to publish a statement requesting that the Jingjian Company temporarily suspend the takeover. In addition, the shareholders were extremely dissatisfied with the candidates for directors and supervisors selected by the new company, and the employees also heard rumors that the personnel of the new company would be completely reorganized, and they all felt uneasy. A few days ago, slogans such as "Raise the political status of workers" and "Down with..." were found around the bus carriages in the city, which aroused great attention from the authorities and all sectors of society. If this matter is not properly resolved, the situation may escalate. Wang Zhenxiang, Vice Chairman of the Jingjian Company, told reporters that the company took over the Fuzhou public bus at the invitation of others and had no intention of monopolizing it. However, this matter is enough to illustrate the difficulty of overseas Chinese returning to invest in the country.

### Jiangxi-Guangxi Coal Mines Launch Exploration Work

[Report from the Central News Agency in Nanchang on the 24th] According to a survey by the Jiangxi Provincial Government, the coal in the Lingxia Coal Mine in Fengcheng is of good quality. The accumulated water in the mine is currently being pumped out. Preliminary investigations indicate that 300,000 metric tons of coal can be produced annually. If a convenient road of about 6 kilometers is built from the mining area to the Gan River, transportation will be even more convenient.

[Report from the Central News Agency in Guilin on the 24th] According to investigations, the coal deposits in the Bose and Tianchang areas of western Guangxi are high-quality lignite from the Tertiary period. The thickest is 1 meter, and the thinnest is also several inches. The volatile matter accounts for 27% to 35%, so the combustion flame is very long, which is very suitable for industrial use. The Guangxi Provincial Government has specially dispatched a team to conduct a survey, which will depart within a week to prepare for large-scale mining.

### Grain Officials Embezzle Funds and Flee. How Can This Be Tolerated? The Authorities in He County Are Strictly Investigating

[Report from our newspaper in Jiaxing on the 22nd] Recently, an incident occurred in the Tianliang Management Office of this county in which Chen Linchao, director of the Wangjiangjing Office, embezzled funds and fled. The reason is that Chen Linchao received seven pre-borrowed grain receipt books from the county management office two months ago and pre-collected them from the people. He did not report the amount that had been borrowed. This time, County Chief Hu Yunyi was transferred by the provincial government meeting last month, and his vacancy was filled by Pan Zhenqiu, the county chief of Chun'an County. In order to prepare for the handover, the county government began to send personnel to check the serial numbers and collect grain from the offices in various districts and verify the receipts issued. Chen Linchao, because the pre-borrowed funds had been lost and could not be compensated, initially made excuses to delay, saying that he would speed up the collection and end it. Then he said that the seven pre-borrowed receipt books had been stolen due to careless storage. He was about to submit a request for instructions. Now that the new county chief, Pan Zhenqiu, is scheduled to take office on the 21st of this month, the county government urgently needs to make a roster for handover, which is imminent. Chen Linchao had no choice and could not explain. He took advantage of the situation and destroyed all relevant documents, receipts, and stubs of the office on the 15th of this month and abandoned his post to flee. After receiving the report, the county government immediately sent personnel to Wangjiangjing to investigate. In addition to discovering a shortage of more than 60 shi of grain, other matters are still under thorough investigation and pursuit. The county government is currently publishing a public notice, soliciting the public to report as much as possible, and reporting to the province for handling.

### The Murdered Township Chief of Yizheng County Hangs on the Beam Yizheng Punishes the Murderers in the Dayan Township Bloodshed The Murderers and Main Instigators Are in Strict Custody

Jin Shouzhu, the chief of Dayan Township in the Fourth District of Yizheng, was strangled to death at Jin's residence in Tumen on the evening of the 16th.

Ningbo scoops up early rice leaving the region in large quantities

In one week, it has risen by as much as 100,000 yuan. The common people are all panicked, as evidenced by the proverb "Yong River cooks a bowl of porridge," which means that Ningbo's grain not only cannot feed itself but also needs to rely on foreign rice. How can we endure it?

### Dancers Accompanying Singers Banned in Bengbu City

[Report from our newspaper in Bengbu on the 22nd] There are no large-scale dance halls in Bengbu City, so there is no dance industry to speak of. Last month, the Yiyuan Restaurant was newly built in the Zhongshan Public Group. At the beginning of its opening, it attracted customers with music and singers. Two singers were hired from Shanghai. At first, they sang to entertain guests, but recently, they openly accompanied dancing. Although there were not many waist goods, there were quite a few people who went to dance every night.

Shooting Skills Lacking, Xingdao Suffers First Defeat; Loses 2-5 to the Dulwich Team; Zhu Yongqiang and Cao Qiuting Each Score One Goal

[Reuters, London, 23rd] Under the gaze of 14,000 spectators, the Xingdao team played their first match after arriving in England today against the Dulwich Hamlet team, a top-tier amateur football team in England. The Xingdao team performed well, especially in short passes, but their shooting skills were lacking. They even missed a penalty kick, and ultimately lost 2-5 to the Dulwich team. Ambassador Zheng Tianxi, the Secretary of the English Football Association, Mr. Russ, and Chinese naval cadets training in England also attended the match. The Xingdao team members all wore yellow and black striped jerseys, which were very beautiful. Although the performance was exciting, there were no surprises, so the famous Wan Jinsan was not used even once. After ninety seconds into the game, Dulwich team's Goff scored a goal. By the 18th minute, the British team had already scored three goals before Xingdao pulled one back. The first half ended with a score of 1-3. At the beginning of the second half, Xingdao scored another goal, making it 2-3, but the rest of the game belonged to the English, who scored two more goals, ending the game with a score of 5-2.

Beautiful Short Passes, Short Stature a Disadvantage

Observing this performance, the Xingdao team's skills, except for shooting, were comparable to those of the Dulwich team, especially their short passes, which were beautiful and sometimes left the opponent unable to cope. However, due to poor shooting, they ultimately lost. Most of the Xingdao players are around five feet five inches tall, so they were at a disadvantage when the ball was in the air. However, they all jumped up to head the ball, and sometimes were able to overpower taller opposing players. In terms of individual performance, the center back Jing Cheng was the most outstanding. Others who performed well included right back Hou Rongsheng and left winger Cao Qiuting. The two goals scored by Xingdao were made by left winger Zhu Yongqiang and Cao Qiuting. The English team's five goals were scored by Goff, Beglin, Davis, Cornett, and Jones respectively. It is noted that the average age of the Xingdao team members is over thirty, and the captain, Feng Jingxiang, is already forty-one years old. Given the heat, this performance is already quite remarkable.

Second Match Scheduled for the 28th

[United Press, London, 23rd] The Chinese Xingdao Football Team had an unfavorable start, losing their first match 2-5 to the Dulwich team. There were 15,000 spectators. The score in the first half was 3-1, with Dulwich taking the lead after Jones, the left forward, scored a goal within the first three minutes. Xingdao had three good opportunities, but failed to capitalize on them and tie the score. In the first half, the Dulwich team's Beglin and Davis each scored a goal, and Xingdao's left forward Zhu Yongqiang finally scored, which was a beautiful goal. At the beginning of the second half, Xingdao launched a major counterattack, and Cao Qiuting scored a goal amidst the chaos. Later, they had a good opportunity for a penalty kick, but missed it. The Dulwich team then scored two more goals, both by Jones. The audience's opinion was that the score did not fully reflect the strength of the visiting team, as the Chinese team could have scored at least three more goals if luck had been on their side.

[United Press, London, 23rd] The Hong Kong Xingdao Football Team visited England and played its first match against the Dulwich Hamlet team today. The audience reached 14,000, and as a result, the Xingdao team lost 2-5. Zhu Yongqiang and Cao Qiuting each scored a goal. Xingdao's left inside forward, Li Zhaorong, did not play due to a right foot injury. Xingdao's next match is scheduled for the 28th of this month, against a team representing the English Football Association in Enfield.

Tennis League: Sports Transport Wins Overwhelmingly, Lianghua Youlian Loses to Green Light; Jinlan Wins Over Lianmei 11-4

Yesterday was the third act of the tennis league. Sports Transport won overwhelmingly over Lianghua with a score of 15-0. The second group was the most intense and exciting. Xu Chengwei's serve and Zhu Kuan's tenacious left-handed play made the hard-hitting Bosky and Benavides struggle. In the first doubles match, Lianghua's Carson did not play, and was replaced by 17-year-old youths Zhu Xianyu and Xie Zhaoliang. Although they were weaker, Zhu's ball skills were quite accomplished and he will surely have a good performance in the initial group of the open singles. Sports Transport's captain Liu Nianxi had rich experience and excellent ball placement, and was very resourceful. On the Youlian court, Green Light won 11-4. Youlian's first group won one point, the second group won three straight games, and the rest were lost. In addition to Hou Danian, Si Deng has returned to Shanghai from Laoshan, so the lineup is more complete. Also, on the Jinlan court, the home team won over Lianmei 11-4.

The Issue of the Exchange Rate for Buying and Selling US Dollars; The Stabilization Board Is Studying It; The Four-Bank Loan Policy Can Be Determined Soon

[Reported by Our Newspaper] The President of the Central Bank, Zhang Jiawei, reported to the highest authorities last Wednesday on the situation of Shanghai's financial and commodity prices after the implementation of the revised foreign exchange settlement method, as well as the Sino-Hong Kong economic agreement and the list of candidates for the Import and Export Management Committee. During his stay in Nanjing, he also met with Special Envoy Wedemeyer to provide reference materials prepared by the Central Bank. He completed his official duties and returned to Shanghai yesterday morning. According to reports, the issue of the exchange rate for buying and selling US dollars is currently being studied by the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee, and will be implemented after being approved by the Executive Yuan's political affairs meeting. As for the loan policy of the Four-Bank Joint Office to national banks, it is also being carefully studied by Xu Baiyuan, the Vice Minister of Finance and Secretary-General of the Four-Bank Joint Office, in consultation with all relevant parties, and a decision will be made soon.

Since the Implementation of the New Foreign Exchange Policy, Conditions in All Areas Have Been Good; Vice Minister Xu Hopes for Mutual Effort from the Industrial and Commercial Sectors

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 22nd] Vice Minister of Finance Xu Baiyuan told our reporter on the 22nd that the situation has been good since the implementation of the new foreign exchange policy five days ago. This method was formulated based on social demands, so it is supported by most of the industrial and commercial sectors, and the response from abroad is also very good. The government is now working hard in all aspects to coordinate with the overall plan. It is hoped that the economy will be active after the implementation of this method, which opens a major door for our economy to embark on the road of self-reliance. However, whether we can move forward still depends on the joint efforts of the industrial and commercial sectors and the people to overcome difficulties, consider the economic conditions of the country and society, and work hard in many ways.

Mr. Xu also solemnly expressed the following three hopes to the national industrial and commercial sectors and the people: Regarding exporters, Mr. Xu believes that the new method is beneficial to exporters, and hopes that they will not repeat the mistakes of the past, competing to buy and sell, which would lead to unfavorable export phenomena. At the same time, he hopes that the quality and standards of export products can be maintained at the appropriate level.

Regarding industrial and mining manufacturers, after the change in foreign exchange, the cost of raw materials that need to be imported from abroad will increase. However, part of the products can be exported, which is sufficient to offset the increase. In addition, high wages and excessive management fees can hinder production. If these two cannot be reduced, then even if the price of raw materials is extremely low, production cannot be developed. He hopes that ways can be found to reduce them.

Finally, and most importantly, a spirit of social thrift should be cultivated. The government has formulated thrift measures, and it is hoped that the whole country can follow them. Otherwise, the cost of domestic reproduction cannot be accumulated. Regarding trade, it is easy to cause smuggling. If smuggling is not prevented, foreign exchange will be consumed as a result, and trade will also be affected. The government is paying close attention to the phenomenon of smuggling, and has agreed on cooperation measures with the Hong Kong government. After the exchange rate is changed, the phenomenon of smuggling can be reduced, but if the people cannot be thrifty, then the phenomenon of smuggling is difficult to eradicate. Therefore, eradicating smuggling should start with thrift.

When the reporter asked about the government's future loan policy, Mr. Xu replied that the government will handle this matter carefully. After the exchange rate was revised, some exporters, hoping for exports, rushed to buy exportable materials, which would inevitably raise the price of export products. The government will certainly be cautious about this type of loan. Furthermore, regarding loans to industrial and mining manufacturers, some industrialists and miners, after the revision of the foreign exchange rate, are willing to store more raw materials. This does not necessarily conform to the principle of balanced development, and does not necessarily coordinate with the entire plan. Therefore, the authorities are also very cautious about this type of loan.

Finally, the reporter asked about the foreign exchange income and expenditure situation, and whether a black market might occur. Mr. Xu replied: Generally speaking, the possible income of foreign exchange will be higher than ordinary estimates. Overseas Chinese have accumulated foreign exchange for some time and have not remitted it back. At this time, the foreign exchange rate is increased, and it is possible to remit back in batches those who have not remitted back before, which should be quite considerable. Some people worry that official exchange settlement of rice, cotton, and other items will affect foreign exchange reserves. Mr. Xu believes that this is not entirely true, because these daily necessities are produced domestically. Purchasing from abroad is only to supplement domestic shortages, and it will never be the case that valuable foreign exchange is used to purchase unlimited quantities, so it does not have any impact on the policy. The government will strictly prevent the possible occurrence of the foreign exchange black market, and hopes that it will not appear.

Young Appointed as Consultant to the National Bank

Financial expert, former financial advisor to the Chinese government, Dr. Arthur Young, arrived in Shanghai from the United States on August 22nd. Mr. Young has been away from China for nearly a year. This visit to China is at the invitation of President Zhang of the Central Bank, as a consultant to the bank, to assist in dealing with the stabilization fund and other current issues.

Chunmao Money Shop Opens Board of Directors Meeting, Chen Quanshi Elected Chairman

Liu Ximen, the former chairman of the Chunmao Money Shop on East Zhongzheng Road in Shanghai, resigned due to illness. The board of directors and supervisors of the shop held a joint meeting at 4 p.m. on the 20th of this month and resolved to approve the resignation. Director Chen Quanshi was publicly recommended as the chairman. It is noted that Mr. Chen is the father of Central Committee member Guo Fuli, and has a high reputation in the financial community. It is believed that the leadership of the shop will be in good hands in the future, and will contribute more to social finance.

Our New Foreign Exchange Policy Helps Carpet Exports to the United States

[Central News Agency, New York, 24th] According to the Commercial Daily, American importers of Chinese carpets believe that the general reaction to the Chinese government's new foreign exchange policy is that, after the basic economic situation in China is changed, the new policy will not stimulate the import of Chinese carpets into the United States. The most important factor in restoring Chinese carpet imports into the United States is whether the domestic economy in China itself can be improved, rather than the open foreign exchange market. The uncertainty in the price of raw materials, the estimation of production, and the unstable labor costs in China have caused Sino-American carpet manufacturers in the Tianjin and Beijing areas to regard production as overly risky. In addition, the decline in US demand for Chinese carpets is also one of the reasons why it cannot stimulate Chinese carpet imports into the United States. However, from a long-term perspective, the new foreign exchange policy does have magical effects for Chinese carpet exporters. In any case, American importers believe that the situation of opening Sino-American trade is difficult to grasp, given the above-mentioned unstable factors.

Tea Merchants' Representatives Go to Nanjing to Petition to Save the Current Difficulties in the Tea Industry

[Central News Agency, Shanghai] The Tea Export Industry Association convened a meeting of all directors and supervisors last Thursday (21st) and decided to send fourteen representatives, including Li Jing, Tang Jishan, Sun Xiaocun, and Wang Zhendong, to Nanjing to present the current difficulties in the tea industry and the remedial measures that should be taken after the implementation of the new foreign exchange management method. They will also request subsidies for the old tea purchased last year, and request the purchase of new tea for the 36th year. The representatives will personally carry the presentation and present everything directly to the Four-Bank Joint Office. It is learned that some of the fourteen representatives have already taken the train to Nanjing on the evening of the 24th, while the rest are scheduled to fly to Nanjing on the morning of the 25th. The main points of the association's presentation to the Four-Bank Joint Office are excerpted as follows: (A) It is requested that the purchase of box tea for the 35th year, which has been approved, should continue to be implemented. However, regarding the tea industry's request for the Four-Bank Joint Office to raise the price of each tea center by 50%, to show consideration and fairness, it is requested that the office reconsider and approve it. (B) If the above method needs to be submitted to higher authorities for decision, it will inevitably be delayed, and the tea merchants are in dire need of rescue. After repeated deliberations, it is proposed that the office approve the organization of a sales committee by the association to be responsible for the export of box tea purchased by the government. The entire tea leaves should be examined for international needs, taking into account the production costs for the 36th year, in order to stabilize the market price and expedite exports. The proceeds, after deducting costs and all incidental expenses, the net profit is intended to be half paid to the national treasury, and half used to subsidize tea merchants, in order to maintain national economic policies and to make up for losses. (C) If the implementation of the B method is still difficult, and according to the actual production cost of the 36th year, it is more than three times higher than the purchase price of the 35th year box tea. If China Trust or other Chinese and foreign exporters sell box tea at low prices to the outside world, the high-cost box tea owned by tea merchants will inevitably be in a desperate situation. Therefore, in order to comprehensively plan and take into account both sides, it is proposed that the government handle the 35th year box tea and the 36th year box tea together. If the China Trust Bureau is also responsible for purchasing the 36th year box tea, this difficulty can be fundamentally resolved. Otherwise, it is proposed that tea merchants repurchase the 35th year box tea at the original price plus interest and sell it themselves, which can stabilize the international market and avoid losses from the high-cost box tea of the 36th year.

Pawnshops List Seven Major Reasons Against the Redemption and Guarantee Method

[Reported by Our Newspaper] The Shanghai Pawnbrokers Association, due to the police department's order to implement the revised method of restricting the redemption and guarantee of pledges within ten days, the association's members believe that this decree not only deprives the freedom of the vast majority of citizens (pledgers), but also hinders the entire industry's livelihood. They have already stated their reasons and requested the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce to forward their request to the mayor to revoke the order, and request the Shanghai Municipal Council to implement its original resolution to revoke this ban. The association hosted the Shanghai news media at the Atlantic Restaurant yesterday to explain the process. The seven major reasons listed by the industry are summarized as follows:

First, pawnbroking is a private financial institution with absolute material credit. Because of its simple lending procedures and good customs, it does have the effect of assisting the country and regulating the economy of ordinary people.

Second, pawnbroking is closely related to the economy of ordinary people, and the government has always had special management regulations for this industry. There has never been such a policy of depriving the freedom of pledgers and merchants in the past, and it should not be implemented on this day of democratic beginnings.

Third, copying citizens' certificates is indeed the tyranny of enemy puppets. Now that national identity cards have not been issued, it is necessary for those who pledge things to have a guarantor prepared.

Fourth, Chinese customs and human feelings value integrity and regard pledging as shameful. Forcing them to declare is tantamount to destroying good customs.

Fifth, military and political personnel passing through Shanghai are endless. Many are looking for relatives and friends who are not encountered, and those who pledge things. If it is necessary to require them to read and copy their identity cards, it is indeed impossible in fact.

Sixth, many poor people in Shanghai, such as rickshaw drivers and peddlers, rely on pawnbroking in the morning and evening to support their lives. Requiring them to provide a guarantee is no different from cutting off their livelihood.

Seventh, the purpose of this case is nothing more than to prevent stolen goods. This industry has always been very strict about preventing stolen goods. Even if one is occasionally deceived into pledging stolen goods, the purpose of selling the stolen goods has been achieved, and they are living a carefree life. Why need to find them again? And pawnbroking has a pledge period of two months, which can be investigated at ease. The effect of preventing stolen goods has not been verified, and the harm to the people is already profound.

Taiwan Sugar Seeks Exports to Japan

Since the government promulgated new regulations on foreign exchange management, Chinese and foreign exporters have shown active signs. Taiwan Sugar Corporation, in order to expand overseas trade, had previously exported sugar to various parts of Nanyang, amounting to several hundred tons per month, and once contacted the MacArthur Headquarters through the China Trust Bureau, and prepared to export a large amount of sugar to Japan in order to earn foreign exchange.

It is learned that Mr. Shen Zhennan, the general manager of the company, has arrived in Shanghai from Taiwan Province on the Hualian Wheel on the 22nd in order to continue to negotiate the export of Taiwan sugar to Japan. According to Mr. Shen, he plans to go to Nanjing next week to report the company's business to the authorities and negotiate with relevant parties on the issue of Taiwan sugar being transported to Japan. If the price is right, it is possible that 25,000 tons of "medium sand" will be shipped this year, but the price is hoped not to exceed 1.2 US cents per pound.

Also, the sugar market was stable and rising the day before yesterday, and sugar from Taiwan was tight. According to the association's division, 29th-period warehouse receipts for medium sand white were 68,000 to 72,300 yuan, up 12,000 yuan. The fourth-and-a-half white warehouse receipt was 795,000 yuan, Shantou green was 520,000 yuan, followed by 500,000 yuan. Red oil was 565,000 yuan, totaling hundreds of packages. Xinghua white bagged was 710,000 yuan, ordinary bagged was 660,000 yuan, Xinghua red was 580,000 yuan, followed by 550,000 yuan, with more than 200 transactions. Qing was 435,000 to 430,000 yuan, with about 400 packages.

How to Lift Control of Yarn and Cloth; The Authorities Are Still Carefully Considering It; The Reproduction Industry Exchanges Views with the Textile Adjustment Committee

In the past few days, the market price of yarn and cloth has inevitably risen, even though the price of yarn allocated by the Textile Adjustment Committee has remained the same. Although the big rise is limited, people outside the industry have been stirred. According to people in the industry, there is no reason for the price of yarn to rise. The allocation of yarn to the reproduction industry increased last week, and the supply and demand in Shanghai is more abundant than before. However, the quota for shipping south and north was being processed last week, and the allocation of yarn by yarn number was opened and then stopped. The disaster relief surcharge will begin again this week, and the market is inevitably tense, so the price has risen slightly. In particular, the price of cloth has been weak for a long time, and it has only recently rebounded, but judging from the cost, the rebound is only enough to break even.

Regarding the recent rumors of lifting the ban on yarn and cloth exports and the abolition of special controls on domestic shipping to the south and north, a responsible person in the industry revealed that, in principle, it can invite the authorities' sympathetic consideration. However, a universal lifting of the ban, to prevent stimulating domestic market prices, is certainly impossible. A limited lifting of the ban can be expected. The abolition of special controls on north-south shipping will be implemented simultaneously with the public warehouse system, and how the public warehouse system can be better than quota sales is still being planned. In the current situation, easing the quota and giving manufacturers a natural adjustment function is the most appropriate. It is heard that several giants in the "reproduction industry" recently invited Liu Siying, the acting chairman of the Textile Adjustment Committee, and others to exchange views widely. Lu Gufan, director of the South China region, was also invited to attend. All believe that in the midst of Japan's opening of foreign trade, the textile adjustment method needs to be reconsidered.

Little Pleasure Boat Poems by Hong Weifa

Twenty-one of Yangzhou Continuation Dreams

I have mentioned the Slender West Lake before, and it is still the only place to visit in Yangzhou. There are many tourists on the lake, and naturally there are many pleasure boats that have sprung up to meet the demand. The boat women who row the pleasure boats are some wildflowers and weeds on the lake. There are people who flirt with these women now, but how could they have been avoided in the past? It's just that the tourists of the past were more elegant, and we can get a glimpse of this from the "Little Pleasure Boat Poems."

The "Little Pleasure Boat Poems" were written by Xin Buyun Hanqing, a senior scholar in Yangzhou who was "thin-faced and melon-shaped, with bones and a kind appearance, frustrated and even more uninhibited, hoping to relieve his worries" (as stated in Ji Liangong's Preface to the Little Pleasure Boat Poems). There are a hundred quatrains, written in the years of Guangxu Yihai and Gengzi. His preface states: "North of Hongqiao in Yangzhou is Changchun Lake, or Slender West Lake. Painted boats and singing were prosperous in the past, but with a change of fortune, people have moved on. Fishermen around the lake now carry passengers in melon-skin boats. In the setting sun and moonlight, amid the shadows of the clouds and waves, one or two disheveled and roughly dressed people are interspersed. Their beautiful words and flirtations are half natural. Although they are not the lofty sentiments of beauties and celebrities of the past, they are still better than the vulgar embrace of merchants and lewd women!" It can be seen that the mingling of tourists and boat women on the lake in the past was neither lofty nor vulgar.

Mr. Xin passed away in the summer of Guangxu Renyin. These "Little Pleasure Boat Poems" were published after Mr. Xin's death with funds raised by the members of the Yechun Houshe. I recently obtained a manuscript from his son and compared it with the printed version. There are many differences in words and sentences. Furthermore, there are two quatrains in the printed version:

Everyone waves their fans, sweat covering their bodies, fourteen people in a narrow lake boat; a new record of a Stone, not distinguishing who is the master and who is the guest.

Lunch at Fahai, the setting sun slanting, the steamed duckling looks like a crow; the glutton is so greedy that he devises a special plan, sharing the pig's head with the little silver girl.

Which are not in the manuscript. And there are also two quatrains in the manuscript:

Passing Xiaojinshan, crossing the Five Pavilion Bridge, still taking a trip on the Stinky Water River; even more delighted that new chrysanthemums are planted this year, discussing going to catch crabs in autumn.

The Lu sisters form their own group, the lame and yellow-haired each excel in their field; they also want to attract people to enter the scenic spot, but where does our home lie other than in the land of Water and Clouds?

Which are not in the printed version. Whether the phrases "Stinky Water" and "lame" were too exaggerated when publishing, far from the actual situation, and two more poems were added, or there were already differences in the transmission of manuscripts at that time, is unknown.

The little pleasure boat is commonly known as the little rowboat. I have already mentioned the form of the little rowboat in recent times in the article "Boat Women," but in the beginning it was not like this. There is a quatrain in the printed version of the Little Pleasure Boat Poems:

Why must there be an awning for coolness and comfort, sending people back and forth in the setting sun; it is often heard that the boatmen murmur, regretting being a man and should have castrated himself!

It can be seen that the little rowboat originally had no awning. As for the business of the little rowboat rowed by the boat women being prosperous, which makes the male boatmen jealous, that is still the case today.

At that time, many of the boat women were famous for a time and were appreciated by elegant gentlemen. And those boat women were also very diligent in serving a group of elegant gentlemen, such as:

Lu's Village is located on the westernmost edge, cutting chives to keep guests, the intention is particularly virtuous; the price of meals and wine is so cheap, it only costs six corners of a little dragon coin. (The manuscript version reads: "Lu's Village in the land of Water and Clouds, cutting chives to keep guests, the intention is interesting; the price of meals and wine is really cheap, both cost six corners of a little dragon yuan.")

Chips, foreign coins, all kinds of colors are complete, picking up cards, sitting and narrating, recognizing east and west; the village girl treats guests with charm, boiled river fish and vinegar-glazed chicken.

Poetic frenzy can't match the豪气 of drinking frenzy, dipping the mouse-hair brush in thick ink; winning the beauty to dust the paper in person, a branch of unruliness to be a boat oar. (The first sentence of the manuscript version, "can't match," is "not as good as," and the fourth sentence reads, "the style is only suitable for us.")

For the love of the second famous flower, who

### "Modern Wu Song" Yang Yangyi Subdues the Tiger Plague in Shunchang County

[Our Fuzhou, 18th Dispatch] In recent years, the tiger menace has been rampant in Shunchang County, northern Fujian. Not only are various villages alarmed, but tigers have even dared to enter the county town in broad daylight, causing officials and civilians to flee in terror. Recently, the tiger plague has intensified, with villagers being devoured while cutting firewood on the mountains, causing widespread panic. The various sectors of the county prepared a substantial reward and sought to hire a "modern Wu Song" from Fuzhou. Although there were many applicants, most did not meet the requirements. Then, Yang Yangyi, a technician from the Institute of Zoology and Botany of the Provincial Research Institute, who had experience in tiger hunting, volunteered to go in his personal capacity. It is reported that after his arrival, Mr. Yang encountered a staggering tiger in a certain area of Shangyang Township. He leaped onto a treetop and unexpectedly shot the tiger in a vital spot. This ferocious tiger, which had plagued the region, immediately collapsed to the ground and died. Upon hearing the news, the villagers rushed to see it. Those who knew the tiger said it was one of the most ferocious in Shunchang. The people rejoiced, and the villages celebrated with cannon fire, jointly celebrating peace. It is reported that Mr. Yang is still in the county, preparing to eradicate the tiger plague. (Special Correspondent Zheng Yu)

Villagers Rejoice and Celebrate Peace Together

A Scene of New Recruits Enlisting in Fengxian: Cai Xiongjie Volunteers for Military Service and Donates Settlement Allowance to Serve the Country

[Our Fengxian, 23rd Dispatch] This year, 325 new recruits from this county have been fully conscripted (the county's quota was 360, but 35 were unfit due to physical reasons). Tang Butao, the Deputy Commander of the Songjiang Military District, led the troop reception unit to the county. On the morning of the 23rd, they were inspected and received separately. Around 11:00 AM, local agencies and organizations held a grand send-off rally for the new recruits at the Fengqing Sports Field. More than a thousand people participated. Chairman Cheng of the Council presided over the rally, and Deputy Commander Tang and County Magistrate Xi delivered speeches of farewell. Lastly, Cai Xiongjie, a new recruit, gave a reply on behalf of all recruits. Female students from the county's orphanage presented a wreath. Cai Xiongjie is a young man from Nanqiao Town in this county. He usually served in the Nanqiao Militia. This time, Mr. Cai sacrificed his family for the country, volunteered for military service, and donated all of his settlement allowance of twelve shi of white rice to the county's charitable organizations (six shi for the infant care center and six shi for the orphanage), demonstrating patriotism and commendable enthusiasm. He received unanimous praise at today's farewell rally. Around 12:00 PM, all the new recruits boarded six large trucks and headed to the Songjiang Military District. County Magistrate Wu and the heads of various townships personally escorted them. All shops and households in the county hung flags and set off firecrackers to see them off, showing their farewell.

### Hangzhou's Private Cotton Mill Faces a New Crisis

[Our Hangzhou, 20th Dispatch] Eight kilometers away from downtown Hangzhou, at Gongchen Bridge, stands Hangzhou First Cotton Mill, one of the largest factories in Zhejiang. It covers an area of more than 100 mu, has 20,000 spindles, and employs more than 1,500 workers. The reporter had the opportunity to visit the entire operation of the factory and learned about the new crisis facing private industry.

Under the guidance of Mr. Pan Hongding, the factory's assistant manager, I visited the cotton cleaning machine, roving machine, spinning machine, fine cloth machine, preparation room, machine room, dyeing room, and packing room. Among these many machines, almost half were manufactured in the United States and Britain around 1897, and the other half were from 1929. Because the factory was originally established during the Qing Dynasty, then owned by the Sanyou Industrial Society, and later sold to the current general manager, Mr. Zhang Wenkui, and others, the machines are relatively old. They spin yarn up to 22 counts and down to 10 or 12 counts, producing about 20 bales per day, each bale containing 40 small packages, each weighing 10 pounds. They weave about 500-600 dozen towels and 500 blankets per day, and 300 bolts of fine cloth. However, during our visit, we noticed that many of the weaving machines were idle. It is said that there are 600 machines in total, but only 200-300 are currently operating because there is a shortage of yarn, preventing large-scale production. Most of the yarn currently spun is American cotton handed over by the General Association, which is then spun into yarn and handed back to the General Association, which resells it to other cloth factories at market prices. It is said that American cotton can be spun into yarn of 20 counts or higher. Domestic cotton, such as that from Nantong, Tongzhou, and Shashi, can only be spun into yarn of 20 counts or lower. Cotton from Yuyao has even shorter fibers and can only be spun to about 12 counts. However, the credit of Yuyao cotton merchants is not very good; they often delay delivery after receiving a deposit. Ordinary small towns generally welcome 12-count yarn because it can be used to knit socks and coarse cloth. Rural people particularly welcome it. Recently, the situation of private factories losing money has become very serious. For example, the cost of producing a bale of 20-count yarn is over 10.01 million yuan, while the official price allows only 9.2-9.3 million yuan per bale. The cost of each bolt of fine cloth is over 400,000 yuan, while the selling price is only about 370,000 yuan. The high cost is due to three reasons: first, the machines are old and not efficient enough; second, the workers' productivity is low; and third, the raw materials are expensive. The recent low selling price of yarn and cloth is due to the opening of trade with Japan. Japanese yarn and cloth will be imported. Recently, Japanese cloth has arrived in Shanghai, costing only 200,000 yuan per bolt. Another reason is that the China Textile Corporation (中紡公司) uses foreign exchange to order large quantities of American cotton from abroad, spins it into yarn, and then sells it at cost. Private companies cannot

obtain large amounts of foreign exchange to order American cotton, so the price of yarn from Zhongfang and even the General Association is lower, and private cotton mills cannot recover their costs.

Hangzhou First Cotton Mill can be considered the only large-scale cotton mill in Zhejiang because few other cotton mills have more than 10,000 spindles. The current state of this cotton mill deserves our attention. From the perspective of addressing the root cause, we should enrich our own raw materials. Places like Yuyao, which are large cotton producing areas, should quickly improve planting methods. If the government cannot improve all cotton producing areas at once, it can incentivize the people to do so. If raw materials are provided locally, a lot of capital can be saved, and costs will be reduced. Next, we should

actively train workers to increase their interest in research. The factory can set up bonuses and adopt Taylor's scientific management methods to give workers a strong interest in improving their work, which can also reduce costs.

The temporary solution is to restrict the import of Japanese cotton yarn and cloth, and even ban imports if necessary. Because China's fragile industry, and among the fragile industries, the cotton yarn and cloth weaving factories, which occupy an important position, will be in danger if Japanese cotton yarn and cloth are dumped in large quantities. Secondly, the China Textile Corporation and the General Association should support private cotton mills so that private cotton mills can

have the opportunity to recover. Because cotton mills, etc., are ultimately light industry, Mr. Sun Yat-sen stipulated in his Principle of People's Livelihood that light industry can be operated by the people and should be encouraged for private operation. Now, regardless of the consequences, having foreign exchange to purchase American cotton and calculating that the cost is sufficient, they sell it without considering the losses of private factories. This is not right. The government established the China Textile Corporation, claiming to support private cotton mills. Now, private cotton mills are truly in need of support. We visited the factory and were deeply impressed by the spirit of the management to strive for the enterprise. (Special Correspondent Chu Yusheng)

### Table of Subjects for University Departments and Faculties: The Department in Charge of the Ministry of Education Has Drafted It and Will Approve and Announce It After the Summer Vacation

[Our Nanjing, 23rd Dispatch] The Ministry of Education's revision of the curriculum standards for various university departments and faculties (including both arts and sciences, i.e., arts, law, education, commerce, science, agriculture, engineering, and medicine) will not be as specific as the curriculum standards for primary and secondary schools, which concretely prescribe teaching hours, teaching material content, and teaching methods. Instead, it will simplify the subjects taught in the various departments and faculties of universities and stipulate a table of subjects for required courses. This will provide a common principle for the various departments and faculties of universities in teaching required courses, and allow for adaptation to local conditions and individualized instruction based on the actual circumstances of each school for the selection of elective courses. Regarding teaching materials and methods, the emphasis is on flexible application rather than strict adherence. Therefore, universities do not need to revise curriculum standards, but only need to stipulate a table of subjects for each department and faculty. It is reported that this table of subjects has been drafted by the department in charge of the Ministry of Education and has been circulated to external educational experts for comments. The Ministry of Education has recently compiled and organized the experts' opinions, which is about to be completed. Minister Zhu will review it after returning from the Northeast. If time permits, he plans to convene a meeting of experts to make the final decision, aiming to approve and announce it for implementation after the summer vacation.

### The Problem of Students Unable to Attend School in Sichuan is Severe; Examinee Commits Suicide After Failing

[Our Chengdu, 24th Dispatch] The problem of students unable to attend school in Sichuan's education sector this year is extremely serious. The entrance exams for Chengdu's "Sichuan," "West China," and "Chenghua" Universities, as well as the National College of Science and other specialized institutions, have all been announced. Statistics show that out of 40,000 examinees, only 4,000 were admitted, a ratio of only 1 to 10. On the 22nd, examinee Yu Zhengzhong committed suicide by poisoning after failing to get into West China University, shocking the entire education sector. Additionally, Shanxi Mingxian College, which relocated to Sichuan during the war, originally located in Jintang, has recently moved to Chengdu and expanded its operations.

We hereby correct this error.
