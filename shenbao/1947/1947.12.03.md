### The Executive Yuan Resolves to Prevent Speculation; Four Cities to Establish Financial Management Bureaus; National Economic Council Simultaneously Establishes Supervisory Body

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 2nd] After the establishment of the Financial Management Bureau, a financial control supervisory body will be established under the National Economic Council to supervise and assess financial control matters. This decision-making body will increase its mobility in supervisory powers. It is rumored that this body may be headed by He Hao Ruo.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 2nd] The establishment of the Financial Management Bureau is to meet current needs and is also a decision made by Chairman Chiang after learning of reports from various parties. The case passed by the Executive Yuan today was handled by the Chairman's order.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 2nd] The Executive Yuan held its 32nd meeting at 10:00 AM on the 2nd, chaired by President Zhang. The meeting received a report on the refugee relief measures drafted by the Ministry of Social Affairs, followed by discussions on proposals, and passed the following two important cases: The Ministry of Finance, in order to prevent speculation and illegal activities by financial institutions in various regions and to stabilize the market, will establish Financial Management Bureaus in Shanghai, Tianjin, Guangzhou, and Hankou. Its organizational regulations were also passed by the Executive Yuan and will be promulgated and implemented immediately. The regulations for the selection and supplementation of councilors for provincial, municipal, and county councils or temporary councils, and the list of selected councilors to participate in provincial and municipal councils, were passed at today's Executive Yuan meeting and will be submitted to the National Government for promulgation.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 2nd] In order to prevent the speculative activities of financial institutions in various regions and stabilize the market, the Ministry of Finance's proposal to establish Financial Management Bureaus in Shanghai, Tianjin, Guangzhou, and Hankou was passed by the Executive Yuan. This new contribution to financial control is indeed an important active measure taken by the government after the economic reform plan. All parties place high hopes on its good results. This reporter recently interviewed Xu Baiyuan, the Vice Minister of Finance, to ask for his opinion on this measure. Mr. Xu said: "This type of control method is indeed superior to the previous control methods, because the past controls were only limited to the four banks and two bureaus, or only to the control of the market, with inconsistent steps. This method can achieve the benefit of unification." At the same time, Mr. Xu believes that he has confidence in this and that it will definitely achieve good results, because he has always advocated adopting this method.

### British Ambassador Arrives in Guangzhou by Plane; Delivers Important Speech; China and Hong Kong to Sign Customs Agreement

[Our Newspaper, Guangzhou, 2nd] British Ambassador Sir Sterndale Bennett arrived in Guangzhou by plane from Shantou this morning. He received reporters at 4:00 PM and delivered an important speech, stating briefly: "This trip has taken me through Southern China, Taiwan, Xiamen, and Shantou, and the impressions are excellent, especially the great potential of Taiwan, which is most admirable. Although this trip is a routine matter, it is to promote future trade between China and Britain, so I have paid close attention to the above-mentioned places." Regarding the financial agreement between China and Hong Kong, Ambassador Bennett said: "The China-Hong Kong agreement was already concluded, but it was temporarily postponed due to changes in China's economic measures last month. The Governor of Hong Kong went to Beijing some time ago and reached a satisfactory result with the Chinese financial authorities. In fact, the China-Hong Kong agreement has already been partially implemented. Another customs agreement concerning the fight against smuggling between China and Hong Kong is also being negotiated, but because Hong Kong is a tax-free port, difficulties have arisen during the discussions, so another China-Hong Kong agreement is being drafted to make up for the deficiencies. The customs agreement has now been fully negotiated and will soon be formally signed and announced by myself and the Chinese government. The content is difficult to disclose at this time."

The pursuing troops and a certain regiment of the National Army from Suining are adopting a strategy of converging attacks. The bandits near Boxian have been cleared.

### Preliminary Procedures for Peace Treaty with Japan; Britain and the United States Are Conducting Discussions; Soviet Proposals Will Be Opposed

[News Agency Report] London, 2nd (Broadcast): According to sources in the British Foreign Office, the United Kingdom and the United States have been discussing the preliminary procedures for a peace treaty with Japan in the past few days. Authoritative sources believe that this indicates that the UK and the US will take a common stance in the discussion of the peace treaty with Japan, opposing the establishment of a veto power for major powers proposed by China and the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union has proposed that the foreign ministers of the four powers convene a meeting in China in January next year to discuss the peace treaty with Japan. The British Foreign Office is currently considering this carefully. Sources in the British Foreign Office predict that the UK will oppose the Soviet proposal, arguing that the purpose of establishing a foreign ministers' meeting is to deal with European issues, and the US will likely take a similar stance. The UK will support the US proposal that the initial consideration of the peace treaty with Japan should be discussed jointly by the eleven member states of the Far East (if Pakistan and Myanmar are included, it should be eleven countries). All legal proposals should be decided by a majority vote, and no veto power should be used. Australia is particularly opposed to the veto power, arguing that all countries in the Far East should have equal speaking rights. Diplomatic observers believe that the Soviet Union's proposal is a bargaining chip in the discussion of the peace treaty with Germany, but the UK and the US are clearly unwilling to mention the Japanese issue before the end of the London Foreign Ministers' Conference.

Editorial

### The First Step to Stabilizing People's Livelihood!

The Executive Yuan held an administrative meeting yesterday to discuss urgent measures to deal with economic chaos. To stabilize finances, suppress prices, and stabilize people's livelihood, it approved the Ministry of Finance's proposal to establish financial management bureaus in the four major cities of Shanghai, Tianjin, Hankou, and Guangzhou. At a time when people's livelihood is withering and threatened by the "end-of-year price surge," the citizens of Shanghai, upon hearing that the central government has taken such wise measures, will undoubtedly wholeheartedly support and welcome them, and hope that the bureau will be established in Shanghai as soon as possible and thoroughly implement the task of what is currently called "economic suppression of chaos." The organizational regulations of the Financial Management Bureau have not yet been published in full in the newspapers as of the time of writing, but it is understood that the bureau will, under the direction of the Ministry of Finance, handle the inspection, supervision, and reporting of financial institutions in various places. Its responsibilities roughly include the following eight items: Examining and reporting on the lending, investment, and other transactions of national banks, bureaus, treasuries, and their trust departments; Examining and reporting on the lending, remittance, investment, and other transactions of provincial and municipal banks, Chinese and foreign commercial banks, trust companies, insurance companies, credit cooperatives, and their affiliated institutions or other institutions engaged in financial business; Supervising and reporting on the joint reserve committees of the banking industry and clearing houses; Reporting and cracking down on state-owned enterprises that violate the regulations on accepting remittances of public funds; Reporting and cracking down on illegal financial institutions; Reporting and cracking down on the illegal buying and selling of gold, foreign currency, and foreign exchange; Investigating and reporting on the trends of the financial market; and Other matters entrusted by the Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank.

From this, it can be seen that the mission of the Financial Management Bureau is extremely important, especially in Shanghai, where the financial market is volatile, and the establishment of financial institutions at this time is particularly needed. Our country has endured eight years of arduous resistance against the war, and the economic losses suffered due to the destruction and ravages of the enemy and puppets are more severe than those of any other allied country. Therefore, the national economy and people's livelihood after the war can be said to have reached a state of poverty and exhaustion. Originally, it was hoped that after the great war, there would be a period of rest and recuperation. However, unfortunately, victory did not bring peace. Instead, we saw the Communist bandits raising troops and causing chaos. They either destroy domestic transportation or destroy industrial and agricultural production, causing nationwide transportation blockages, production stagnation, and people unable to make a living, suffering from hunger and cold. Their ultimate goal is nothing more than to use this to promote the economic collapse of the country and facilitate the Communist bandits' seizure of power. The Communist bandits harbor such sinister schemes and tricks, which are not only known to the entire country, but also to the friendly foreign people. At present, during the period of military suppression of chaos, military and political suppression of chaos are certainly the most important. However, the Communist bandits' chaos is ubiquitous. In addition to openly rebelling in the military and political spheres, they also disrupt the market in the economic sphere, attempting to use economic disorder and popular anxiety to enhance their military and political power. Therefore, if we want to suppress chaos, we must get to the root of the problem, find out the source of the chaos, and then prescribe the right medicine to achieve the effect of suppressing the chaos. This is why the call for "economic suppression of chaos" has moved from rhetoric to reality. The establishment of the Financial Management Bureau this time is shouldering this sacred mission. The whole country should have great expectations for the establishment of this new organization. Here are a few of our observations for the authorities to consider. First, the establishment of the Financial Management Bureau aims to suppress chaos, not to create it. Therefore, if there is chaos in the economic sphere, it must be stabilized, and its chaos must never be increased. The bureau's responsibilities, as mentioned above, are purely financial management. Fluctuations in the financial market will inevitably cause prices to fluctuate, which has the greatest impact on the national economy and people's livelihood. If we want to stabilize people's livelihood, we must first stabilize finances and bring them back to normal. But how can we stabilize Shanghai's financial market and calm the storm? Whether in terms of methods or steps, there is a need for careful research. In particular, we must not forget that financial policy must be coordinated with national economic policy. In other words, we must stabilize finances on the one hand, and not stifle industry and commerce on the other. Otherwise, it would be tantamount to abandoning the fundamentals and pursuing the superficial. On the surface, it may seem that prices can be suppressed temporarily, but after a certain stage, production will shrink further, and materials will become even scarcer. As a result, industry and commerce will inevitably suffer, and the common people will not feel any relief. On this point, we must ask the Ministry of Finance to pay special attention to whether the policies it implements are in line with the policies of promoting production when setting up this new agency.

Second, the future Financial Management Bureau should be a local financial management agency established in accordance with the organizational regulations passed by yesterday's administrative meeting. Although it is established in four major cities simultaneously, Shanghai is the financial center of the country. Every ripple and wave will affect the country's finances. Therefore, the Shanghai Financial Management Bureau is nominally a central agency stationed in the local area to manage finances, but in reality, it has a national character. We hope that every action of the Shanghai Financial Management Bureau, which is about to be established, can be reasonable and legal. In other words, it must carry out its duties and accomplish its mission within the scope of the law under the national production policy. Those who bear this mission must not be ignorant of the trend of the national situation and the aspirations of the people, and blindly act rashly and seek quick success, so that the effect of stability cannot be seen and the society is already in a state of anxiety.

Third, according to the provisions of the organizational regulations, when the Financial Management Bureau performs its duties, the local government and military agencies should provide practical assistance. If any matters requiring inspection are discovered, the police bureau should be notified at any time. From this, we can understand that after the Shanghai Financial Management Bureau is officially established, the responsibility for managing the financial market will be entirely borne by the Shanghai Financial Management Bureau, that is, entirely by the Ministry of Finance. At that time, not only will the responsibilities be clear, but also the powers will be unified. Today, those who talk about administrative efficiency all advocate clear responsibilities and unified powers. Otherwise, they will shirk each other's responsibilities, and nothing will be accomplished. Therefore, after the establishment of the Shanghai Financial Management Bureau, the municipal government authorities and military and police agencies will only be responsible for "assisting" it in performing its duties.

Finally, we would also like to suggest to the financial authorities that controlling finance is only the first step in stabilizing finance. Can the financial market be stable and can people's livelihood be stable with just this step? This is still a very serious question. As mentioned above, financial policy should be coordinated with economic policy. It is absolutely not enough to rely solely on financial management. The most practical thing is to implement controls on essential goods for people's livelihood and crack down on speculation and hoarding for profit, so that their prices do not fluctuate frequently. In this way, people's livelihood will gradually become stable. Therefore, we hope that the central government can implement management measures for essential goods for people's livelihood after the establishment of the Financial Management Bureau, especially for goods such as yarn and cloth, and food. A reasonable control policy should be implemented first. Since the outbreak of the war, the United Kingdom has implemented a rationing policy for daily necessities, and even today, two years after the victory, the country still implements a rationing system, just like during the war. This is a good example for our country and worth learning from. However, recalling that during the Anti-Japanese War, the government in Chongqing also established management bureaus for daily necessities, such as the Flower Yarn and Cloth Control Bureau, but it seems that they did not achieve any results. However, various management bureaus established during the period of suppressing chaos today must not repeat the mistakes of the past and expose the incompetence and inefficiency of political personnel. Therefore, we advocate that unless we no longer establish any management bureaus, we must pay attention to administrative efficiency and ensure that it carries out its tasks and truly achieves the goal of stabilizing people's livelihood.

### British Ambassador's Remarks

(Continued from Page 1) Regarding the issue of increasing Sino-British trade, the biggest difficulties at present are the currency system and import issues. Therefore, there has been no progress in Sino-British trade after the war, which he deeply regrets. However, he is optimistic and believes that it will definitely be improved in the future. In the spring of last year, the British government proposed to China to conclude a commercial treaty. In September of the same year, China submitted a corresponding proposal to Britain. The British Embassy forwarded it to the British Ministry of Commerce. However, because Britain was busy negotiating commercial treaties with Western Europe at that time, it was unable to consider and respond immediately. The British side has recently begun to study this, but he could not say when a response could be given. Regarding the issue of inland navigation rights, Ambassador Stevenson denied that he had requested China to open up the proposal. He believes that China's protected navigation rights are a legitimate move, but he believes that in order to increase imports and exports and make profits, China urgently needs to increase free ports in places such as Nanjing and Hankou to facilitate the import of ocean-going ships, communicate the products of central China and the industrial products of foreign countries, and cited the difficulties of exporting eggs from central China and importing gasoline from British merchants as examples to emphasize the necessity of opening up ports. Regarding the issue of British merchants investing in China, according to Stevenson, it is unlikely in the near future before the British economy improves. Regarding the signing of a peace treaty with Japan, he believes that the sooner the better, and believes that the Japanese can only be given a low standard of living to reduce the burden on the Allied countries. When asked about the British attitude towards the Soviet proposal to hold a four-foreign ministers meeting in Beijing, he said that he knew nothing about it. Ambassador Stevenson will stay in Guangzhou for three days before transferring to Hong Kong, and will return to Beijing next Monday. He will give a speech to students in the city tomorrow.

### Stuart Appears Discussing "Freedom"

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 2nd] US Ambassador Stuart delivered a speech at the alumni association of Yenching University here last night at 8:00 pm, stating that today's world is divided into two fronts, each with its own "ideals", but it can be said to be a distinction between "freedom" and "no freedom." The Ambassador warned that unless the rulers work for the welfare of the people and give them "freedom from want" and "freedom from fear," revolutions will inevitably arise, and such revolutions will only lead to a world without freedom, forming a "dictatorship" or "police state." Stuart said that self-reliance is the key to democracy, and freedom of thought is especially important. Freedom is based on truth. One of today's crises is the concealment of truth and its use for political propaganda. The misuse of propaganda is extremely harmful. It is reported that Stuart is scheduled to fly to Beiping on the 23rd for Christmas.

### Fuxin Coal Storage Transported to Dictionaries; Fushun Coal Production Depressed

[Our Correspondent, Fanyang, 2nd] After the Fuxin-Jinzhou Railway was connected on the 25th, 2,000 tons of stored coal have been shipped out. However, the increase in Fuxin coal production depends on the solution of problems such as power supply, materials, and funds. In addition, the Fushun Coal Mine only produced 30,000 tons of coal in November, with an income of 2.3 billion yuan and an expenditure of 5 billion yuan. Due to the lack of electricity, the water in the mine is getting deeper and deeper, which can be described as full of worries.

### Severe Power Shortage in Northeast; Changchun Experiences Another Power Outage

[Our Correspondent, Shenyang, 2nd] The power shortage in the Northeast is still serious. The newspapers in Fanyang were published at noon yesterday due to power relations.

Changchun experienced another power outage on the 29th. The Changfa Power Plant needs 100 tons of coal per day, and it is impossible to replace coal with bean cakes. According to Guo Keti, director of the Northeast Power Bureau, the current situation cannot be maintained unless measures are taken to increase the power supply. He is trying to install thermal power generation equipment, but the fundamental solution is to open up the hydropower source. It is especially necessary to open up the route between Jilin and Changchun. It is also reported that the authorities have decided to do their best to save electricity in order to maintain power for production. Except for the important agencies of the Xingyuan and newspaper offices, the power supply to general users will be stopped.

### Three Resources Committee Paper Mills Actively Planning to Increase Production

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 2nd] The government believes that paper is a daily necessity, and its relationship with the development of news and cultural undertakings is particularly important, and is now strengthening the increase in paper production. It is reported that the three paper mills in the Northeast, North China, and Taiwan taken over by the Resources Committee after the victory have been actively resuming work and production in order to gradually supply domestic needs, but because the required foreign raw materials and materials are not easy to purchase, production has not been able to increase rapidly and in large quantities. In view of the urgent need for paper in the country and the urgent expectations of the news and cultural circles, the Resources Committee convened the responsible persons of the Liaoning, Taiwan, and Tianjin paper mills in Beijing in the middle of last month to review the production plan for the 37th year and plan how to increase production. Now this method has been generally decided. If the necessary foreign exchange can be obtained as soon as possible, the paper mills under the Resources Committee can increase the production of various types of paper by 20,000 metric tons in the 37th year, plus the original production of 11,000 metric tons, for a total of 31,000 metric tons, which is worth approximately US$11 million, of which approximately 24% must be used to purchase foreign materials, so the actual savings can be more than US$9 million.

### Representative of the United Nations Appeal for Children Fund for the Far East, Mr. He Cibo, Issues Statement, Negotiating Establishment of Chinese Committee in Nanjing

[Our Correspondent, Nanjing, 2nd] Mr. He Cibo, the representative of the United Nations Appeal for Children Fund (UNACF) for the Far East, arrived in China from the United States a few days ago. On the 2nd, he arrived in Nanjing from Shanghai and met with Gu Zhenggang, Minister of Social Affairs. In the afternoon, he held a press conference introduced by the Information Bureau of the Executive Yuan. He issued a statement saying:

"The United Nations Appeal for Children work is a global movement for automatic donations to help the world's poor children. This fundraising movement has been approved by the United Nations General Assembly and the Economic and Social Council. Under the leadership of the United Nations, each country will automatically organize a fundraising committee representing the people themselves to promote fundraising. Therefore, the United Nations Appeal for Children is a unique development of international organizational work. Individuals from all countries can directly participate in a formal international plan through this, which is a historical initiative. Personal donations or goodwill contributions to the United Nations Appeal for Children establish a private relationship with the United Nations, and this personal action is to address the most pressing and fundamental problems the world is facing, namely the welfare of the next generation, which is actually the survival of the next generation.

On the other hand, the United Nations Appeal for Children's work is also a great action to unite people. People from all countries, regardless of the amount of donations, are equal participants. It is quite obvious that the people of some countries with urgent needs themselves cannot donate as much as the people of countries with better circumstances. However, the United Nations Appeal for Children's relief work does not differentiate between donors and recipients. All people recognize their responsibility to the next generation, so please do your best to contribute generously. The funds raised will then be distributed according to needs.

I came from the UN headquarters at Success Lake and will set up a regional office for the UN Appeal for Children Fund in the Far East to represent the headquarters at Success Lake and liaise with the appeal committees in China, Siam, India, Pakistan, the Philippines, Australia, and New Zealand. My mission to Nanjing this time is to plan the establishment of the Chinese Committee for this fundraising and relief effort."

Mr. He hopes to promote the fundraising movement by contributing "one day," where everyone contributes one day's income or all their labor and time. Accumulating little by little will surely have a significant effect. He explained the reason for conducting fundraising work in poor countries such as China and India is to enable individuals who still have surplus capacity in various countries to do their best and then distribute it reasonably, to show fairness in the burden. He also emphasized that the promotion of this fundraising movement and relief work can promote the United Nations organization to be well-known and generate feelings because of the widespread benefits to children, and then enthusiastically support permanent world peace, which is promising.

Mr. He met with Minister Gu and other senior officials of the Ministry of Social Affairs in the afternoon. They are all willing to fully support and assist the establishment of a Chinese committee by purely non-governmental organizations. He also reported at the end of the meeting that the United Nations International Children's Emergency Relief Fund was established as early as the year before last, but because the amount of funds was small, it was difficult to develop the work, so this global appeal was launched. Although the funds raised are distributed by the headquarters, each fundraising country can declare its right to retain priority distribution when paying the funds, including a US$3.5 million emergency relief plan for Chinese children, which is under discussion; most of the relief items are food, mainly milk powder and cod liver oil.

### Continuing Discussion on Procedures for Treaty with Germany; Four Powers' Opinions Gradually Converging; Mr. Marshall Invited to Dinner by Soviet Foreign Minister on Friday

[Central News Agency, London, 1st] The sixth meeting of the four foreign ministers tonight discussed the procedures for the Treaty with Germany, and has reached closer agreement on three of its points than at the Moscow Conference, but not an actual resolution. The issues discussed tonight involved: 1. Voting procedures at the peace conference; 2. How the treaty will be signed and by which country; 3. The relationship between the treaty and the German constitution. The meeting was chaired by Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov. Regarding the first point, Marshall suggested that when the four foreign ministers draft the final content of the Treaty with Germany, it should be based on "recommendations supported by a two-thirds majority at the peace conference," and consideration should be given to suggestions supported by a simple majority at the peace conference. Bidault accepted Marshall's suggestion in principle, but subject to agreement on the actual composition of the peace conference. Molotov also expressed acceptance with additional amendments, on the condition that the final content of the treaty should not be based on "recommendations supported by a two-thirds majority at the peace conference." Bevin expressed reservations and the issue will be discussed again tomorrow. Regarding the issue of concluding the Treaty with Germany, the British and Soviet foreign ministers jointly proposed that "the Treaty with Germany should be signed by a German government suitable for accepting the treaty." Marshall expressed acceptance, but Bidault reserved his attitude. Regarding the question of whether the Treaty with Germany should be included in the future German constitution, there is a great difference in opinion between the US, UK, and French sides and the Soviet Union. Marshall and Bidault jointly proposed that "the German constitution should include a clause stipulating that all powers under the constitution should be based on and in accordance with the peaceful settlement agreed upon between the allied countries." This suggestion was accepted by Bevin, but strongly opposed by Molotov. Molotov said that if this clause is included in the German constitution, it seems that there will be a risk of turning Germany into a colony. He said that if any victorious country claims that Germany has violated the constitution, that country can use this as an excuse to undermine the German constitution.

[United Press, London, 2nd] US Secretary of State Marshall accepted an invitation from Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov today and will have lunch together on the 5th, which is the first opportunity for the two to directly discuss US-Soviet issues since the Moscow foreign ministers' conference this spring. The US delegation did not specify what kind of results Marshall hopes to obtain from the banquet. At the same time, the foreign ministers' meeting will reconvene tonight to continue discussing the best way to draft the Treaty with Germany.

### US Senate Smoothly Passes Emergency Loan Bill for Aid to France, Italy, and Austria; House to Bring Up for Discussion Tomorrow

[Our Dispatch] New York, 2nd, Radio: Washington dispatch, it is reported that the House is expected to discuss the foreign emergency aid bill passed by the Senate on Thursday, but most Republican members believe the amount is too large.

[Reuters, Washington, 1st] The Senate passed the $597 million emergency aid bill for France, Italy, and Austria on the 1st by a vote of 83 to 6. Before the vote, Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Vandenberg called for the speedy passage of the bill to inspire the people of Western Europe. The passage of the bill in the Senate marks exactly two weeks since the special session of Congress was convened, and three weeks since Secretary of State Marshall personally presented the winter aid plan to the foreign affairs committees of both houses. Vandenberg's appeal stated: "The value of fire fighting lies in speed. The significance of this bill is not only in dollar aid, but also in the freedom of Western Europe. These countries are struggling to resist fierce pressure, and the maintenance of their morale depends on US aid."

### $60 Million in Aid to China Still Awaiting House Vote

[United Press, Washington, 1st] The Senate today approved a $597 million emergency aid bill for France, Italy, and Austria by a vote of 83 to 6. It is not yet known how the House will vote on the bill stipulating $60 million in aid to China. The total amount of the emergency foreign aid bill passed by the House Foreign Affairs Committee is $590 million. In addition to the $60 million in aid to China, there is a remaining $530 million in aid to France, Italy, and Austria, a reduction of $67 million from what President Truman requested in his message. The President's message did not advocate aiding China at this time.

[Reuters, Washington, 1st] The House Foreign Affairs Committee voted today to restore $38 million of the $180 million previously decided to reduce in the emergency foreign aid bill, specifying that the entire amount should be used to purchase wheat to help Italy. The $60 million in aid to China in the emergency foreign aid bill remains unchanged, so the amount of the emergency aid bill approved by the House Foreign Affairs Committee is $587 million, of which $527 million is for aid to France, Italy, and Austria (a reduction of $70 million from President Truman's original proposal) and $60 million for aid to China. The State Department originally hoped that emergency aid to Europe would be passed by Congress on the 1st, but based on the current situation, it seems that it will have to wait at least a week before it can be fully passed by Congress. House Speaker Martin said today after attending a meeting of House Republican leaders that the emergency aid bill could be approved by the President by the end of next week. The House is expected to begin debating this week and complete action on the bill in the middle of next week. Martin also said: "The Republican leadership meeting did not reach a resolution on the details of the bill, and decided to leave it to the House Foreign Affairs Committee to decide."

### Britain Sells Gold; Domestic Capital Allocation Also Reduced

[Reuters, London, 1st] The British Treasury recently announced that total gold sales in November amounted to £48 million, and that it purchased $60 million from the International Monetary Fund in the same month.

[United Press, London, 1st] The government released a white paper today announcing emergency measures to reduce national investment over the next six months. The most affected areas are the construction of new factories, roads, and airfields. The government's aim is to reduce planned investment by £180 million, so as to transfer manpower and financial resources to other important export industries.

### US Commerce Secretary Harriman Emphasizes Price Controls

[Reuters, Washington, 1st] Commerce Secretary Harriman told the House Banking and Currency Committee, which is reviewing Truman's anti-inflation bill, that if the United States does not obtain the enforcement control powers requested in the bill, it may later lead to the danger of adopting swift action to universally freeze prices and wages. Harriman also clearly stated that the Truman administration does not intend to restore a large-scale control system and opposes the adoption of any extensive controls unless absolutely necessary. He said: "I believe that at present, only limited controls should be implemented on items that affect the livelihood of ordinary families, such as housing, fuel, food, and clothing, as well as important industrial products." Members of Congress have not yet expressed a reaction to Harriman's warning. They have not shown support for Truman's radical suggestions.

### French Parliament Reconvenes to Discuss Anti-Strike Bill; Communist Party Members Obstructing Meeting Have Been Expelled from the Venue

[Associated Press, Paris, 2nd] The first part of Prime Minister Schuman's anti-strike legislation, which requires authorizing the government to call up 80,000 reservists and, if necessary, serve as police force, was published in the Official Gazette this morning and has become law. The bill authorizes the Minister of the Army to command the reservists, but the first order to use the army should be issued by the Minister of the Interior.

[Associated Press, Paris, 2nd] After sitting in the National Assembly all night, the Communist Party members were no longer present in the venue on the 2nd. Speaker Herriot resolutely ordered helmeted, green-clad guards to clear the council chamber. When the guards first tried to enter the chamber, Communist Party member Gu Dangsha, who was also responsible for administrative affairs of the council, came out to prevent them from entering, saying that this action violated the constitution. The guards re-entered the chamber under orders, broke up the encirclement of the Communist Party member Galat, and carried him out. Communist Party leader Ducos then ordered the remaining Communist Party members to line up and leave the venue behind the guards, thus ending the Communist Party's sit-down strike to prevent the anti-strike bill from passing. The National Assembly reconvened at 3 p.m. to discuss the anti-strike plan. Communist Party members have delayed the meeting for 30 hours in the past two days. They firmly declared on the 2nd that they will continue to prevent the passage of Prime Minister Schuman's plan.

### French Foreign Minister Returns Home; Mauville Temporarily Replaces Him During His Absence

[Associated Press, London, 2nd] Authoritative sources declared on the 2nd that French Foreign Minister Bidault's hasty departure from the Foreign Ministers' Conference and rush back to Paris was mainly due to de Gaulle's threat that if he was not satisfied with Bidaulte's actions on Germany, he would veto them. Bidault rushed back to his country to find out where he stands. French Foreign Minister Mauville is temporarily taking over Bidault's position at the Foreign Ministers' Conference. No decisions can be reached by the other three foreign ministers during Bidault's absence. Bidault arrived in Le Havre on the morning of the 2nd and immediately returned to Paris by special trip, planning to stay in the French capital for a day. It is reported that de Gaulle plans to publicly criticize and veto any decisions made by Bidault at the London Conference that he cannot agree to. De Gaulle advocates weakening Germany and separating the Ruhr and Rhine regions from Germany.

### US Prepares to Send Military Advisors to Italy, Using Aid to Greece and Turkey as Example; Left-Wing Mayor of Milan to Be Replaced

[Associated Press, Washington, 2nd] Reliable government sources report that the US military authorities have drafted a plan to provide military guidance and assistance to Italy. If the Italian government submits a request and it is approved by the US Congress and the State Department, it can be implemented. Authoritative sources pointed out that there is no legal way to prevent the Italian government from requesting the United States to send a military mission similar to that in Greece and Turkey to serve as advisors to the Italian General Staff. However, the plan to withdraw about 1,000 US military technicians and staff from Italy in mid-December is still underway.

[Associated Press, Rome, 2nd] The Italian government carried out its order to transfer the left-wing mayor of Milan on the 2nd and strengthened security forces. The streets leading to the city hall were reinforced with electric fences to prevent the Communist Party from occupying the city hall for the second time. Milan Communist Party leader Bachida immediately convened an emergency meeting of the Northern Italy Touring Team on the afternoon of the 2nd to decide on "appropriate" steps to oppose the government's decision.

[United Press, Rome, 2nd] The national strike of Italian municipal employees, originally scheduled to begin on the morning of the 2nd, has been canceled because the government agreed to allocate funds to the city government to implement pay increases. The extensive unrest caused by the dismissal of the left-wing mayor in Milan last Friday and this Monday has also been resolved. According to an announcement made by Interior Minister Silva on the night of the 1st, an agreement has been reached with the left-wing mayor Trollo. Trollo agreed to resign on Thursday and be temporarily replaced by the current mayor of Padua, Siloona, until the originally elected mayor, Dora, returns from vacation.

### United Nations to Organize Palestine Committee as Soon as Possible; Plan to Control Jerusalem Under Drafting

[Central News Agency, Lake Success, 1st] According to a senior United Nations official close to Lie, Assistant Secretary-General of the United Nations Hu Shize, although scheduled to preside over the secretariat of the Korean Committee, may be reassigned to the more important Palestine Secretariat.

[Reuters, Lake Success, 1st] Opposition to the partition of Palestine and the Middle East countries has led the United Nations organization to step up the establishment of agencies to implement the partition plan. United Nations Secretary-General Lie and other senior officials are scheduled to meet today to select all members and staff of the Palestine Committee, about 60 people.

Of the five countries participating in the committee, only the Czech Republic has nominated Mr. Lisicky as the Czech member of the committee. Lisicky previously served as a member of the United Nations Special Committee on Palestine. The United Nations authorities have urged the other four countries, Panama, the Philippines, Denmark, and Bolivia, to nominate candidates as soon as possible. Lie will also consult with the Security Council and the Trusteeship Council on the border issues between the Jewish and Arab states. The headquarters of the Palestine Committee is expected to be located in Jerusalem, which will become an international zone.

[Associated Press, Lake Success, 1st] The Trusteeship Council quickly completed its plan for the control of Jerusalem under the United Nations Palestine Partition Plan on the 1st. The Trusteeship Council established a committee to draft the plan in detail. The administration of the city will be under the Trusteeship Council of twelve countries, rather than under the Jewish or Arab state after partition. Iraq may withdraw from the meeting, as it, like other Arab countries, has allowed the boycott of all United Nations processes on Palestine.

### Our Representative Liu Kai Attends Trusteeship Council Meeting

[Reuters, New York, 2nd] The United Nations Trusteeship Council decided yesterday to notify the South African government of the date on which the Council will review the report on Southwest Africa submitted by the South African government, and welcomed the South African government to send a representative to participate in the review. At the beginning of the meeting, Chairman Cyr pointed out that Southwest Africa is not a trust territory, so although the General Assembly has authorized the Council to review the report on Southwest Africa, it is questionable whether the South African government can be invited to send a representative to attend the review in accordance with the procedures for trust territories. Chinese representative Liu Kai advocated inviting the South African government to send a representative to attend the review in accordance with the procedures for trust territories. After the deliberation, Liu's proposal was eventually passed.

### Intense Arab Resentment: Holy Land Experiences Major Riots; Crowds Strike, Demonstrate, and Protest Partition

[United Press International, Jerusalem, December 2nd] Arabs throughout Palestine began a three-day strike today to protest the partition. A large-scale riot erupted here today, with several thousand Arabs firing shots in the city, burning shops, overturning cars, and throwing stones at buses. Both Arabs and Jews suffered casualties, but the exact numbers are not yet known. British troops and Palestinian police arrived at the scene in armored vehicles and trucks, quickly set up barricades, and tried to stop the rioters from advancing. Jewish self-defense forces were also mobilized to protect the lives and property of the Jewish people.

According to police estimates, no fewer than five thousand Arabs rushed out of the old city and poured into the Jewish residential area. Encountering military barricades, they turned to Saint Julian Street, one hundred yards from the King David Hotel, and began smashing windows along the way. At least six shops and two Jewish-owned cars were set on fire. Firefighters rushed to put out the flames, while police drove armored vehicles into the crowd and opened fire. A group of Arabs shouted "Despicable Americans" and threw stones at the car carrying the United Press International reporter, but luckily missed.

[Reuters, London, December 1st] Since the UN General Assembly passed the resolution on the partition of Palestine, the reaction in the Arab world has intensified. The following are reports received from various locations:

Cairo

The seven-member Arab League Council is scheduled to meet in Cairo on December 12th to discuss the partition of Palestine. Before officially announcing this, League Secretary-General Azzam Pasha had telephone conversations with the Prime Ministers of Syria, Iraq, Lebanon, and Egypt. Meanwhile, Egyptian students continued to protest and demonstrate. Students from Cairo University marched through the streets under police escort, shouting slogans such as "Down with the United Nations," but no incidents occurred.

Beirut

Ten thousand Lebanese students, carrying Arab flags and banners, demonstrated in front of the United States Information Service and the French embassy, throwing stones at the latter and shouting anti-American slogans.

Amman

A large crowd of Arabs demonstrated in front of the Arabian American Oil Company (Aramco) office here, burning one of the company's cars and severely beating an American driver. The crowd also attacked a school run by a British church, forcing students to join the march.

### Katayama and Cabinet Members Accused of Complicity in Black Market Activities

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, December 2nd] On November 29th, Hara Izuru, Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Labor-Farmer Party, filed a complaint with the Tokyo District Public Prosecutor's Office, accusing Prime Minister Katayama and seventeen other cabinet members, as well as forty-six prefectural governors, including Tokyo Governor Yasui, of complicity in black market activities. The content of the complaint is as follows: The government's published estimate of actual rice production is far less than the actual harvest. The government knowingly ignored this inaccuracy, which constitutes suspicion of complicity in fraud. Secondly, the government's action is equivalent to tacitly approving farmers' sales on the black market and complicity in violations of the Food Control Law.

### Internal Division in Socialist and Democratic Parties Causes Political Instability in Japan; Difficulty in Selecting Minister of Agriculture; Kitamura Continues as Minister of Transportation

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, December 1st] Tokyo Shimbun stated in an editorial today that the coexistence of the left and right wings within the Socialist Party is the fundamental reason for the current confusion and instability in the Japanese political arena. The newspaper believes that unless a way is found to eliminate the division between the left and right factions within the Socialist Party, the Katayama Cabinet will remain in a precarious situation.

The issues of coal mine nationalization and the appointment of the Minister of Agriculture are merely the initial signs of the crisis caused by the Socialist Party's misguided policy of accommodating the left wing.

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, December 1st] Well-informed sources told the Central News Agency reporter this afternoon that the resignation of Japanese Minister of Transportation Komiyaji Gizan was due to an emergency recall by the Democratic Party to strengthen the party's unstable organization. Komiyaji possesses financial and political power within the Democratic Party, sufficient to restrain the party's volatile members.

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, December 2nd] The Cabinet has approved the appointments of Kitamura, recommended by the Democratic Party, as the new Minister of Transportation, and Takeda as Minister of State today. The formal appointment ceremony will be held after the Emperor returns to Tokyo from his inspection tour. It is said that Kitamura Tokutaro is known as the "Minister of Political Connections" in the Socialist Party, originally belonging to the faction of Inukai Ken, and is also very friendly with Suzuki Mosaburo of the left wing. Takeda Gi is a descendant of a wealthy landlord family, but Takeda himself is known as a "people pleaser."

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, December 2nd] The left wing of the Socialist Party held a plenary meeting today, resolving that: "If Prime Minister Katayama's so-called government truly intends to implement socialist policies starting next year, then it is even more necessary for Nomizo to become Minister of Agriculture. Therefore, Nomizo should still be recommended as Minister of Agriculture." With this, the possibility of the left wing compromising on the issue of the Minister of Agriculture is almost hopeless. At the same time, both the Democratic and National Cooperative Parties still insist on disagreeing with Nomizo's appointment as Minister of Agriculture.

### Japan to Increase Trade Ports from Next Year

[United Press International, Tokyo, December 1st] Starting next January, Japan will open fourteen more ports for foreign trade, bringing the total to fifty-six.

### Financial Management Bureau to be Established; Li Lixia Concurrently Appointed as Shanghai Director; National Bank President Returns to Shanghai After Consulting in Beijing; Further Actions to be Discussed Today

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, December 2nd] The Executive Yuan approved the establishment of the Financial Management Bureau on the 2nd. The appointment of the Shanghai Director was announced by the Ministry of Finance at the same time, with Li Lixia, Director of the Auditing Department of the National Bank, concurrently appointed. Bi Delin, Assistant to the Minister of Finance, will serve as Deputy Director. The Ministry of Finance immediately telegraphed Shanghai, urging Li to take office and quickly establish the bureau.

[Central News Agency, Local Report] President of the Central Bank, Zhang Jia'ao, went to Beijing to consult on the "Emergency Measures for Economic Suppression of Chaos" and other issues. In Beijing, he met with Premier Zhang of the Executive Yuan and was summoned by Chairman Chiang for detailed instructions. President Zhang returned to Shanghai yesterday morning. According to Zhang's interview with reporters, the government is determined to curb prices and stabilize people's livelihoods. In the future, more forceful measures will be taken. The detailed methods are still being finalized. The organization, powers, and other details of the establishment of the Financial Management Bureau will be officially announced by the government, he said. Furthermore, Mayor Wu Guozhen and Chief Commander Guan Sitiewu have not yet met with Zhang as of the 2nd. It is rumored that Zhang, Wu, and Guan will meet on the 3rd to discuss further actions. In addition, the Central Bank continued to tighten credit on the 2nd, and prices continued to decline.

Mayor Wu Guozhen told reporters yesterday that he had recently received a telegram from Chairman Chiang, instructing him to inform Chief Commander Guan and President Zhang to immediately discuss all possible measures to rescue the current financial and price crisis. After receiving the order, he prepared a plan, which President Zhang took to Beijing for approval. Because he is only a local leader, and the handling of finance and prices affects the entire country, it must be handled directly by the relevant central government agencies. For example, the handling of gold and US dollars is the responsibility of the two ministries. He is only in an assisting role. Now that the Central Government has decided to establish the Financial Management Bureau, the Municipal Government should do its best to assist in its implementation. As for the Economic Inspection Conference held in this city, because it is to review the effectiveness of implementation and establish detailed rules for implementation, it will continue to be convened according to actual needs in the future, he said. According to a Huadong News Agency report, the Financial Management Bureau could be established within this week.

Yesterday morning, the section announced the following: Since Guohua, Dahua, Dafeng, Tangyiji, and other four cutting paper mills are engaged in the business of cutting paper, they should not store large quantities of paper. They should immediately be ordered to submit detailed reports of the names, occupations, and addresses of their paper storage clients. If it is found that there are paper storage clients that do not belong to formal bookstores or paper stores, they should be punished in accordance with the Emergency Measures for Combating Hoarding and Speculation of Essential Goods. Furthermore, Dahua Paper Mill claimed that the stored paper was produced by the factory, and should be exempted from prosecution. Other paper stores such as Yiji Xin, Yichang, Yuanji, and Qianghua have little paper stored and no evidence of hoarding, and should be exempted from prosecution, and their accounts should be returned. Regarding the crackdown on hoarding paper and eliminating the "paper tiger," the section has drafted two measures: The Social Affairs Bureau shall review and approve the restrictions on the quantity of paper stored by paper stores and the registration procedures. Anyone with factual evidence of hoarding paper will be strictly dealt with in accordance with the "Emergency Measures for Combating Hoarding and Speculation of Essential Daily Goods."

### Chang Yarn Factory Workers Implement Slowdown

[Our Newspaper] The Central-made winding machines of the Lun Chang Yarn Factory in this city before the war were seized by the Japanese during the war. The machines currently in use are made in Japan, and their production efficiency is much lower than that of British-made machines. Most of the factory's workers are paid by piecework. As a result, working hours are longer than before, while the proportion of wage income is actually lower than before. They demanded that the factory add machines, increase wages, and reduce working hours. Because this was not accepted by the factory, they started implementing a slowdown a few days ago, which is currently being mediated by the Social Affairs Bureau.

### Guohua Tobacco Factory Employees Slow Down Work

[Our Newspaper] More than 600 employees of the Guohua Tobacco Factory in West Shanghai have been slowing down work since last Saturday. According to an investigation by the Social Affairs Bureau, the reason for the slowdown is that they demand that their full monthly wages be calculated according to the cost of living index for that month.

China has rarely had close ties with European politics, but after this war, Europe, America, and Asia stand as three pillars, the world is one family, and China is one of the permanent members of the Security Council, so it attaches great importance to the establishment of this committee. The success or failure of the committee is a touchstone for the United Nations' guarantee of collective security, he said. It is heard that the committee has already gathered in Athens. The initial work will be to set up monitoring posts along the border areas of the countries involved, and each country will send observers to patrol the border security at any time. The United States has sent Ambassador-at-large Kirk, a naval admiral, as its representative, and the United Kingdom has also sent former Ambassador to China, Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, as its representative. Other countries have also sent important envoys to participate. The international community's attention to the future development of the committee is evident.

### Our Delegation to the United Nations Educational Conference Received Courteous Treatment in Mexico; Mexico City Schools Respectfully Name a School "China School"; Hang Liwu Issues a Statement on the Election of the Executive Committee [Nanjing Dispatch from Our Newspaper, December 2nd] According to news from the Ministry of Education: Our delegation to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) conference in Mexico received courteous treatment from the local government in Mexico City. The Mexico City government, in order to respect China and express its respect, named a school in Mexico City "China School." This type of respect is a first outside of the United States. Our delegation's Secretary-General Ju Nong and Ambassador Feng visited the school, and the staff, students, and locals set off firecrackers and competed to present agricultural products. Also, on Mexico's Revolution Day, the Mexico City government specially awarded medals and certificates to the chief representatives of the countries attending the conference. Secretary-General Qu was also invited to speak to teachers in Mexico City during the conference.

[Central News Agency, Mexico City, December 1st, Special Dispatch] Hang Liwu, at the United Nations Educational Conference this morning, representing our side, issued a statement expressing great regret regarding the results of the Executive Committee election on November 19, because the Philippine representative nominated by our country, Dr. Alzuona, was not elected as an Executive Committee member. Mr. Hang expressed great admiration for the spirit of the Philippines in accepting the conference resolution. He said: The Philippines is a young country that is enthusiastic and willing to contribute to international understanding and cooperation. We believe that it will be happy to assume its responsibilities. Our chief representative Hang Liwu also stated: He deeply hopes that countries in the Far East will soon obtain more appropriate seats on the Executive Committee, and that women can also participate in the senior committees of UNESCO. Afterwards, representatives from the United States, Brazil, and Uruguay also spoke in succession, all expressing their support for our country's statement.

### Matters to Note for Self-Funded Students Exchanging Foreign Currency [Central News Agency] Before October 29, because the Central Bank had not yet received the "Regulations for Foreign Exchange Settlement for Publicly Funded Self-Funded Students" promulgated by the Executive Yuan on October 24, in order to prevent applicants from suffering losses due to fluctuations in foreign exchange prices, it had notified designated banks that any requests for foreign exchange settlement could first be accommodated according to the approved amount and settled at the market price, and then adjusted after the measures were announced. Since October 29, when the Central Bank received the regulations, it has prepared detailed procedures in accordance with the regulations on self-funded students and notified designated banks to handle them. However, there are several points that relatives of self-funded students or other applicants must pay attention to:

1. Students who passed the first and second examinations, because the Central Bank has received the list sent by the Ministry of Education, only need to state to the designated bank and ask them to notify the Central Bank of their name and application number, etc., so that they can immediately check and reply directly, without having to ask people to inquire and expedite.
2. Scholarship students approved to study abroad by the Ministry of Education, because the Central Bank has not yet received this list and cannot verify it, must quickly obtain certificates from the Ministry of Education, not only proving that they are self-funded students approved to study abroad, but also proving that they are scholarship students. Without this certificate, even if they ask for help from others, it will not be possible to handle it.
3. According to Article 9 of the regulations, self-funded students who are already abroad, regardless of whether they have passed the examination, must obtain certificates from the school and the consulate, not only proving that they are indeed studying at the school, but also proving whether they have a scholarship and the amount. The Central Bank is deeply concerned that those who have applied several months ago will have to submit them again for review at this time, then the applicant must apply for them from abroad again, which will take months. In order to respond to the urgent needs of students abroad and to avoid losses due to exchange rate fluctuations for some applicants, it has notified the designated banks to first settle the foreign exchange according to the approved amount, but instructed the applicants to submit the above-mentioned certificates. From January next year, all applications must be accompanied by the above-mentioned certificates, otherwise they will not be processed. Therefore, applicants must pay attention to cooperating with the Central Bank, otherwise, difficulties will inevitably arise in the future.

Even with a factor of 5,000, except for Jiangsu, where the culture expenditure reaches more than 18%, the remaining provinces are only less than 10%. According to the constitutional provisions at the time of the implementation of the constitution, the county culture expenditure must reach 35%, which is far from the standard. Therefore, there have been calls from various places to rescue national education.

### Winter Relief Fund-Raising to Solve Housing Shortage; Actively Planning to Issue NT$100,000 Lottery Tickets to Acquire a House

[Report from our Newspaper] The Winter Relief Association Fund-Raising Committee, to solicit a large amount of donations, previously suggested to the Relief Association to innovatively issue charitable lottery tickets to build one hundred or two hundred houses. After deducting the cost of land and construction, the remaining funds would be used for winter relief. It is proposed that the total value of the lottery tickets issued be NT$100 billion or NT$150 billion, with NT$50 billion allocated for winter relief. The Relief Association has agreed to this proposal in principle and is actively planning its implementation.

Some of the building sites are public land, while others will be provided by real estate developers, purchased by the Relief Association at an agreed price. To this end, real estate developers held a meeting on the 1st, with the Director of the Land Administration Bureau, Zhu Ping, also attending. Once the building sites are determined, bank loans will be secured for construction. The lottery tickets will be sold in two types: Type A, priced at NT$200,000 per ticket, and Type B, priced at NT$100,000 per ticket. In the future, the lottery drawing will award winners of Type A tickets a two-story house with a double frontage, valued at NT$1 billion, while winners of Type B tickets will receive a two-story house with a single frontage, valued at NT$500 million. The houses will be fully equipped with modern sanitary facilities and will be exquisitely designed. Mayor Wu stated yesterday that the city government strongly supports this plan, as it can raise funds and solve the housing shortage, a win-win situation. Therefore, the city government will actively pursue it.

Charitable Horse Racing Highly Possible

Regarding the issue of holding charitable horse races, Mayor Wu stated yesterday that it is highly possible. The Jockey Club has expressed its willingness to cooperate, but a considerable amount of preparation time is required, as horses need to be selected and trained before racing. The racecourse currently has some existing racetracks, some of which were leased to the U.S. military. Efforts are underway to reclaim them, and after training, horse racing can be realized. Regarding rumors that the Jockey Club has told the city government that it must agree to long-term horse racing before it will cooperate, Mayor Wu denied this yesterday.

Speaker Donates to Lead the Way

City Council Speaker Pan Gongzhan, in response to the Winter Relief Fund-Raising campaign, generously donated NT$5 million to show his support. The council has recently received relatively few donations from the press, totaling NT$20 million from the Xinwen Daily, NT$5 million from the Xinye Daily, and NT$4 million from the Fei Bao, all of which have been collected by the collecting bank. The committee chairman, Du Yuesheng, expressed his gratitude for the enthusiastic publicity and donations from the press and will recommend that Mayor Wu present them with certificates of appreciation.

### Guang Xue Hui 60th Anniversary Celebration Scheduled for Tomorrow

The Association was established in the fourteenth year of the reign of Emperor Guangxu of the Qing Dynasty (1887), when the Chinese court and people had not yet embraced Western culture. The Association's first General Secretary, Williamson, and his successor, Dr. Timothy Richard, believing that the key to China's strength lay in instilling new ideas, translated, wrote, and published various new books and newspapers in Shanghai. Dr. Richard's "A Comprehensive History of the New West," an eight-volume work, was reprinted many times and remained popular for twenty-five years. The president of the University of Nanking, Dr. Bu Fangji, wrote "A Record of Christ's Life," published in 1896, and reprinted twenty-three times, making it the best-selling biography of Christ in China. In 1892, the Association took over the "Wan Guo Gong Bao," edited by Dr. Allen, changing it from a weekly to a monthly publication. The 24-page newspaper was exquisitely printed, with each issue containing seventy-five pages of commentary, editorials, and introductions to other Western works and historical materials. It was a must-read monthly publication for people at the time. Even the scholars of the Hanlin Academy extracted the essence of the newspaper to compile publications of the Hanlin Academy.

Later, with the successive establishment of publishing houses such as the Commercial Press, the Guang Xue Hui focused on introducing Christian cultural works, such as the Bible Dictionary, the Four Gospels Dictionary, and commentaries on the Old and New Testaments, which were essential reference books for various churches. The Association also collaborated with Nanjing Jinling Theological Seminary and the University of Nanking to publish dozens of books on society, geography, science, biography, stories, music, plays, and children's books, totaling hundreds of publications.

Among the magazines that continued to be published after the war were "Nü Sheng," "Fu You Bao," and "Tong Sheng." "Nü Sheng," founded in the early years of the Republic, was a publication for housewives. "Fu You Bao" was a children's publication, founded in 1915, and has never been suspended, with current sales of over 13,000 copies nationwide. "Tong Sheng" is a quarterly publication that church workers need to consult. In addition, there are plans to revive "Min Xing," a publication for the general public, using a dual-column format of phonetic symbols and Chinese characters, which is very helpful for people who already know basic vocabulary. These publications have excellent editing and are very popular with readers.

During the Anti-Japanese War, the Association moved west with the government, continuing to publish newspapers in Hengyang, Chongqing, and Chengdu, and selling them to the rear to meet the urgent needs of readers. After the victory, it returned to Shanghai for reorganization. Besides the lack of talent and economic resources, it is gradually restoring the work of editing and printing new books. To reach a wider audience, it has established a membership system. Anyone who agrees with the Association's mission can become a member. Starting next year, members who pay a small annual fee of NT$10,000 will receive three major magazines published by the Association and all new books published throughout the year, approximately dozens of volumes, which is a rare opportunity for the reading community. Those who wish to join can write to the Association at 128 Huchiu Road for more information.

Since its establishment, the Association has published no fewer than a thousand books, making great efforts to introduce the newest ideas and Christian culture. In the future, it will continue to dedicate itself to new books in various disciplines to contribute to the spiritual construction of our country. The Association will hold a celebration for its 60th anniversary at the New Tian'an Church on Suzhou Road at 4:00 PM on Thursday, the 4th of this month.

### Beauty Returns After the War, Seeking to Reclaim Her House; Lawsuit Against Manager of China Textile Company for Rental Dispute Adjourned, Awaiting Judgment

[Report from our Newspaper] The case in which American beauty, Ms. Xue Fo, sued Wang Tongyuan, manager of China Textile Company, and his brother, Wang Lianyuan (supervisor of China Textile), seeking a judgment to compel them to vacate a garden house at 4, Lane 506, Jianguo Middle Road, was heard in the Civil Division of the District Court yesterday. Judge Lu Pingru adjourned the trial, setting a date for the verdict. The house originally belonged to Ms. Xue Fo. When the Pacific War escalated in September 1942, Ms. Xue was sent to Chongqing to assist the Chinese government in the war effort. She rented the house to Wang Tongtian for a period of one year, expiring on August 31, 1943. Wang requested an extension for two years, which Xue agreed to. At the end of that term in 1945, Wang requested a further six-month extension. Ms. Xue stipulated a new lease was required, but Wang refused.

Subsequently, Ms. Xue learned that the U.S. military authorities needed to use the house, so she sent a letter on September 21 of last year urging Wang to vacate the premises, but to no avail. Later, Ms. Xue was ordered to return to the United States to relinquish her military position. During this time, Wang sublet the house to his brother Wang Lianyuan for use. Now, Ms. Xue has returned to China and intends to reclaim the house for her own use. She is suing in court, stating that she served China at the risk of her life, as evidenced by a letter from Wu Tiecheng, Secretary-General of the Central Committee of the Kuomintang, and requesting the court to order the first defendant, Wang Tongyuan, and the second defendant, Wang Lianyuan, to vacate the premises. She also requests that the defendants bear the costs of the lawsuit and that provisional execution be granted. During the trial yesterday, the defendant Wang Tongyuan was absent, represented by a lawyer. The lawyer denied that Wang had sublet the house, stating that Wang Lianyuan is his younger brother, and he is currently in Hongqiao for medical treatment, so he entrusted his brother with the management of the house. Ms. Xue presented her case and submitted Mr. Wu Tiecheng's letter for review. After arguments by both sides' lawyers, the court set the verdict for the 6th.

### Further Interrogation of Multiple People in UNRRA Case Regarding Flour Milling and Allegations of Embezzlement

[Report from our Newspaper] The District Attorney's Office yesterday continued its investigation into the case of senior UNRRA officials accused of corruption, interrogating Xi Debing, General Manager of the Flour Company, and Ying Yuanlong, former Chief of the Welfare Section of the General Affairs Department of UNRRA, regarding the milling of wheat and the distribution of items within UNRRA, examining possible fraudulent activities in great detail. The interrogation lasted from 2:00 PM to 3:00 PM, after which both were ordered to remain on bail. Yesterday, several other important witnesses were also summoned, but all failed to appear, citing various excuses.

### Decided on Detailed Regulations for Transportation of Reparation Goods; China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to Dispatch Two Ships for Transport

[Report from our Newspaper] The meeting of the Committee for Supervising the Transportation of Japanese Reparations and Restitution Goods continued yesterday afternoon from 3:00 PM to 5:30 PM. During the meeting, very detailed decisions were made regarding the transportation regulations for the goods. Attendees believed that this point was extremely important, as a breakdown in one area could affect the entire transportation process. The meeting also decided that representatives from relevant agencies would form a liaison committee that would meet weekly, with the first meeting scheduled for next Thursday. Hu Shiyuan, Deputy Manager of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, will serve as the Shanghai representative of the Reparations Committee, and Zhou Maobai will serve as the Shanghai representative of the delegation in Japan.

Qin Fen Returns to Nanjing Today After Completing His Official Duties

Qin Fen, Chairman of the Allocation and Transportation Committee, told reporters after the meeting that although the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company is scheduled to dispatch the "Haizhe" and "Haikang" vessels to Japan on the 10th of this month to transport goods, due to the lack of trade relations between China and Japan, everything still depends on the Allied Headquarters. It is necessary to wait for their reply telegram before determining the exact date. The first batch of goods to be transported to China will be shipped back after being distributed in Japan. The quality of the machinery is excellent. The warehouses prepared by various agencies in Shanghai were inspected yesterday and are still able to meet the needs, which is extremely important. Otherwise, if the warehouses are unable to accommodate the goods, they will pile up at the docks, which will not only hinder the transportation plan but also damage China's image.

Regulations Established for Preferential Treatment of Manufacturers

Regarding the request from private manufacturers for preferential treatment in the allocation of reparations goods, Mr. Qin stated that the government has now established preferential repayment methods. However, after eight years of bitter war, the people who have suffered losses are not only those in the industrial sector. Reparations goods are the only compensation that Japan can provide to China, so the government must consider the interests of the entire nation when utilizing these goods.

### Sentencing in the Qingpu County Fifteen-Life Case, Families Still Dissatisfied

Zou Baoxian, who served as the head of a township in Qingpu County during the enemy-puppet period, relied on his power to kill fifteen local men and women. After the victory, the families of the deceased sued him in the Shanghai High Court for treason and murder. The High Court sentenced him to life imprisonment. The families of the victims believed that the sentence was too light and that there was no provision for compensation to the families. They repeatedly protested to the District Court, the District Attorney's Office, and the High Court, but to no avail. Unexpectedly, yesterday morning around 10:00 AM, five women and children from the families of the victims, carrying infants, broke into the main traffic artery of the District Court, lying on the ground and wailing loudly. Despite the bailiffs' attempts to intervene, they were ineffective and blocked all vehicles from entering and exiting the District Court until around 12:00 PM, when the bailiffs finally persuaded them to stand up. It is understood that their goal is to obtain compensation to maintain their livelihoods. However, according to the law, the property of traitors must be confiscated, and there is no explicit provision for compensation.

### Deadly Herbal Remedy; Four Temple Clerks Transferred to the District Attorney's Office

[Report from our Newspaper] Hou Guoxing, a 46-year-old man from northern Jiangsu, recently fled with his family from the bandit-controlled area of his hometown to Shanghai, settling in a shack on Xietu Road in the Nanshi district. Hou suffered from a cold during the journey, so shortly after arriving in Shanghai, he fell ill with damp fever and typhoid, but had no money to seek medical treatment or take medicine. The day before yesterday, he was introduced by a neighbor to the Tianwang Dashuai Temple on Kangqu Bridge to seek a divine prescription, obtaining ten ingredients, including red [unclear] , raw [unclear] , Longjing tea leaves, poppy flowers, and Buddha's hand citrus. On the way home, he obtained the "divine medicine" from the Liu Yang He Tang Pharmacy, returned home, and took the decoction. By 6:00 PM, he had been summoned to the underworld by "Marshal Wang." The family, believing that the temple clerks had prescribed the medicine recklessly and disregarded human life, reported the matter to the Changshu Police Sub-Bureau for investigation. The police officers were dispatched to the temple for investigation, and immediately detained Zhou Wenlong and Miao Shifa, who were making a living by extorting money, but had no medical knowledge. Liu Shaozhu, the owner of the Liu Yang He Tang Pharmacy, and his partner Shen Dezhen were also arrested for prescribing folk remedies without authorization. The police bureau has charged Zhou and Miao with murder, and Liu and Shen with negligent manslaughter, and transferred them to the District Attorney's Office for investigation.

### Fire on Fan Yu Road Destroys Five Straw Sheds

At 9:50 AM yesterday morning, a large fire broke out in the straw sheds on the vacant lot at the intersection of Fanyu Road and Hongqiao Road in western Shanghai. The fire started when a resident of the vacant lot, where many poor citizens lived in straw sheds, was careless, and the fire spread to neighboring homes. A strong north wind was blowing at the time, quickly turning the fire into a conflagration. The Jing'an Temple Fire Brigade and the Huashan Road Fahua Fire Brigade dispatched vehicles to jointly extinguish the fire. After an hour of burning, the fire was finally extinguished, resulting in the destruction of five straw sheds. The cause of the fire is currently under investigation by the police bureau.

[Report from our Newspaper] Jiang Shanchu, the President of the Jiading County District Court, came to Shanghai yesterday afternoon with two empty suitcases to request the City Police Bureau's Criminal Investigation Division to check for fingerprints. He stated that on the evening of the 1st of this month, a judge in the court had 法幣700,000 and a gold watch, which were stored in the suitcase, stolen. Afterwards, the judge suspected two workers in the court of being responsible but did not investigate them.
