### Further Negotiations Needed for Government Reorganization: Youth and Democratic Socialist Parties Hold Talks in Shanghai; New Peace Proposal Already Delivered to the CCP

[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 24th] Lei Zhen left Nanjing by car at 3:50 PM on the 24th for Shanghai. It is said that he is there to discuss government reorganization with various parties in Shanghai, as the participation of the Democratic Socialist and Youth parties in the reorganized government has already been decided in principle; only the method of participation remains to be determined.

[News from Our Paper] This reporter recently met with Mr. Zuo Shunsheng and asked for his thoughts after discussions on the government reorganization. He replied with three points:

(1) All parties believe that for the government reorganization to succeed, the Kuomintang must first change its 20-year one-party style. This change must be thorough, from the central to the local levels, and completely overturn previous habits. Otherwise, non-Kuomintang figures will inevitably have many concerns about participating in the government.

(2) The second chapter of the Constitution regarding the freedoms and rights of the people must be implemented early. Otherwise, if freedom of speech, publication, assembly, and association cannot be legally guaranteed, there will inevitably be many obstacles to the future of the reorganization.

(3) Current economic and financial measures are causing people to feel constant anxiety about their livelihoods. There must be appropriate emergency measures taken to gradually stabilize the situation before other matters can be calmly discussed.

[News from Our Paper] The nine standing committee members of the Youth Party in Shanghai held a discussion meeting at Zuo's residence last night to exchange views on matters discussed in Nanjing. It is also said that the five standing committee members of the party who remained in Nanjing will also return to Shanghai soon.

[Central News Agency Dispatch from This City] Most of the standing committee members of the Democratic Socialist Party have left Shanghai for the New Year, so the party headquarters remained deserted yesterday. When the party's central standing committee meeting, which has attracted much attention, will be convened has not yet been decided. Mr. Xu Chuanlin felt quite tired after negotiating with various parties in Shanghai and Nanjing, and went to Hangzhou for rest on the 11th, and is scheduled to return to Shanghai a week later.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 24th] The capital spent last year amidst the rain and snow of peace talks, but because the Communist Party expressed its rejection, it was as if the gloomy weather had sunk into a state of delay. Most of the Democratic Socialist and Youth Party figures in Nanjing went to Shanghai on Lunar New Year's Eve, leaving Zhang Dongsun, who once met with Chairman Jiang and was also summoned by the American and Soviet ambassadors. Zhang left Nanjing for Shanghai by train on the 23rd. Before his departure, he had a long talk with Lei Zhen, which was said to be related to the government reorganization. The government's statement and new peace proposal were delivered to the CCP office on the 22nd by Fu Jingbo of the US Embassy. The CCP stated on the 24th that the CCP's response to this matter could be found in the Liberation Daily's editorial on the 21st. The article still adheres to its past style, denouncing the government's move as a "new trick." The final paragraph states: "Finally, we express that the CCP and the Chinese people resolutely and urgently demand true peace and true democracy. Based on our own painful experience, we are determined not to be fooled again, [we] must expose Jiang's new trick," and strive to achieve the above two minimum requirements through our own efforts to lay the foundation for true peace and democracy, and will not stop until the goal is achieved.

[Central News Agency Dispatch from This City] The Secretary-General of the Democratic League, Zhang Dongsun, and the Deputy Director of the Propaganda Committee, Ye Danyi, were invited to Nanjing on the 19th by the US Ambassador Stuart and stayed for four days. They returned to Shanghai by car yesterday (the 24th). This reporter visited yesterday, but Mr. Zhang was sound asleep due to fatigue from the journey. Ye Danyi received the reporter. According to Ye, they had two long talks with Ambassador Stuart in Nanjing, mainly about the Yanjing University affairs, and also expressed their views on the current situation. However, Ambassador Stuart did not express any opinion. Zhang was invited to a banquet by Chairman Jiang on the 21st at noon. Those present also included Madame Chiang, Zhang Qun, and Lei Zhen. When Mr. Zhang Dongsun went to Nanjing, he carried documents such as the declaration of the Second Plenary Session of the Democratic League, originally intending to present them to Chairman Jiang. Unexpectedly, they were stolen at the Shanghai station, so Zhang gave a brief report on the content of the declaration at the banquet, and emphasized the hope to stop the civil war and resume peace talks as soon as possible. Chairman Jiang expressed his deep agreement. The matter of government reorganization was not mentioned. When asked if the Democratic League still intends to mediate since the resumption of peace talks is on the verge of despair, Ye replied: The Democratic League is now powerless.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 24th] This reporter visited Shao Lizi tonight and asked about the government reorganization issue. Shao expressed no opinion, only saying: I hope that all newspapers will pay special attention to international developments.

### Britain Does Not Interfere in China's Internal Affairs: Resolves to Fulfill Moscow Declaration and Support National Government; Lord Privy Seal Announces in the House of Lords

[Reuters, London, 23rd] The British House of Lords held a debate on the situation in China today.

[Another Dispatch] Lord Jowitt, the Lord Privy Seal, representing the government, responded to the proposal by Labour MP Lindsay in the House of Lords that Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union should jointly discuss the situation in China, stating: Britain has promised in the Moscow Declaration that it will not interfere in China's internal affairs, and will continue to strictly abide by this promise in the future. Chinese affairs are the affairs of the Chinese people. Britain only hopes that internal reconciliation can be quickly achieved in China. If Britain can help, it will do its best to facilitate it. The Moscow Declaration recognizes China's need for a unified and democratic government. Britain continues to recognize the National Government led by Chiang Kai-shek as the legitimate government of China. Britain will continue to support this government in completing unification and democracy. This is our consistent policy.

Britain will never blindly follow any foreign policy.

However, he also said: If China wants to become a truly democratic country, it must not be subject to the totalitarian rule of one party. Therefore, Britain deeply welcomes the implementation of the Moscow Declaration regarding the expansion of the government's foundation to accommodate democratic elements. He continued: He agreed with General Marshall's expression of dissatisfaction with the mutual suspicion between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party and hoped that all parties and well-meaning elements would unite and work hard for the happiness of the country. Jowitt also immediately denied that Britain's support for the US policy towards China was encouraging the civil war in China, stating that the British government will never blindly follow any foreign policy. Britain's goals in China are the same as those of the United States. The purpose is to trade and maintain a strong relationship with a government with a broad democratic foundation. Other than this, Britain has no other aspirations. Jowitt also denied that Britain was supplying China with arms, and said: As far as he knows, the United States has also not supplied China with arms for several months.

Hopes for China's unification; hopes US will continue to mediate

He went on to express his welcome for China's commencement of establishing a constitutional government, but it was extremely unfortunate that the Communist Party refused to participate. He hoped that the CCP would no longer reject this final opportunity to participate in a democratic government for the sake of national interests so that peace and unification can be achieved. He further hoped that other parties could facilitate the CCP's joining and that the United States could continue to mediate. Britain will do its best to provide moral support to the United States and the National Government of China. Jowitt then mentioned Britain's position in China, expressing hope that British property could be returned as soon as possible. The British government should encourage British businesses to restore their position in China and supply China with what it needs. The Chinese counter-proposal to the Sino-British Commercial Treaty is under study by the British government. He believes that the most important point is to allow British ships to freely dock at various ports along the Yangtze River. Jowitt concluded by stating that according to the Sino-British Agreement on the abolition of British extraterritorial rights in China, the Chinese government should accept all formal responsibilities for the former public concessions. The British government believes that this responsibility should include granting fair severance pay to British employees of the former Public Works Department.

### US Loan to China

Marshall to Urge Re-Preparation

[United Press, Washington, 21st] A spokesman for the Export-Import Bank announced today that if China wants to obtain the $500 million loan designated by the United States, it must reorganize its economy within five months. In other words, the Chinese government must submit a detailed plan by June 30 explaining how it will use the loan. The United States had designated $500 million as a reconstruction loan for China ten months ago. If the loan is not released by June 30 of this year, it will automatically expire. Marshall urged the Export-Import Bank to store funds to await when he was a special envoy to China last year, in order to induce China to stop the civil war. However, even if June 30 of this year is the deadline for the release of this loan, it does not mean that China will never be able to borrow from the United States. The new Secretary of State Marshall may ask the Export-Import Bank to consider preparing for another loan.

### Pierson Guilty of Rape in Shen Chong Case; Shen's Father Says His Daughter Will Drop Out This Semester

[Our Beiping Dispatch of the 24th] The public trial of the American soldier's assault case was completed on the 20th. Although new witnesses were discovered here among the Chinese and American witnesses presented by both sides, they did not attract the attention of the court. The debate court was opened on the 21st. After the prosecutor announced the key evidence of Pierson's crime, the defendant's lawyer also made a seemingly correct but actually wrong "consensual sex" argument. However, after the prosecutor's rebuttal, the case was closed. On the 22nd, Pierson was declared guilty of "rape." The case proceeded for a total of five days, from the 17th to the 22nd, and everything proceeded according to plan. The reactions from all parties were generally good, believing that the US military authorities' attitude towards this incident was quite enlightened. Now, the only thing to pay attention to is the sentencing. What should be noted here is that the prosecutor also admitted that Pierson committed rape while drunk.

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 22nd] Lieutenant Colonel Hughes, the presiding judge of the military court of the First Marine Division of the US Marine Corps stationed in China, announced that the American soldier Pierson's assault case should be considered rape. The court began at 10:00 am on the 22nd. Those attending the hearing included Hu Shi, Zuo Mingche, Ji Yuan, and 17 Chinese and foreign reporters. First, Assistant Prosecutor Lieutenant Colonel Young read the interrogation record of the fourth day of the court. Then, the prosecutor announced that he had asked Division Commander General Howard last night whether the third and fifth charges in the indictment should be disregarded. According to the reply telegram, the two charges should be dropped. At this time, the presiding judge was shocked, and the defendant Pierson was alarmed. After only five minutes of discussion by the judges, the presiding judge Lieutenant Colonel Hughes announced that the second and fourth charges in the indictment were not established, and Pierson should be found guilty of the first charge of rape. The announcement immediately ordered the defendant to be returned to custody. It was 10:30 am. The prosecutor then announced the end of the case. As for the sentence to be imposed, it will be announced after it is submitted to the Secretary of the Navy in Washington for review. At this time, the attendees Ji Yuan, Zuo Mingche, Hu Shi, and others shook hands with each other, expressing their joy at winning the case. As for the apology from the United States, it will be held after the verdict is reviewed and announced. Compensation is pending application by the victim's family for separate handling.

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 23rd] Hu Shi, the president of Peking University, told reporters on the morning of the 23rd after the American soldier Pierson was found guilty of rape: I told everyone (local and foreign press) on the 6th of this month that I had confidence that the US military court could make a fair judgment. Now that Pierson has been found guilty of rape, it proves my confidence. This case was judged extremely fairly. Also, it is said that another American soldier accomplice case may be publicly tried by another court next Wednesday (the 29th of this month). This court will be simpler. Also, Shen Shao, the father of Shen Chong, said: He will fly to Nanjing on the 24th. Miss Shen will also return to Nanjing a few days later. She will definitely drop out of school this semester.

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 24th] According to related sources, Shen Shao, the father of Shen Chong, came to Beiping to participate in the public trial of the criminal American soldier on a plane from the 332nd Air Force Squadron of the US military. Now that the American soldier has been found guilty of rape, this case has come to a temporary end. It is said that Shen will return to the south immediately, and the US military authorities have prepared a seat on the plane for him.

### French Troops Land on Paracel Islands Again; We Conduct Direct Negotiations; French Ambassador to Visit Vietnam to Investigate the Actual Situation

[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 24th] Regarding the Xisha (Paracel Islands) incident, the current situation has slightly changed. Before the 23rd, the French side still frankly admitted that the landing of French troops on Baode (Pattle) Island in the archipelago was not ordered by Paris, which would not affect the negotiations and allow the problem to be resolved. Ambassador Meyrier also indicated that he would visit Vietnam to understand the actual situation. However, after French troops landed on another island in the archipelago on the 23rd, the French side's attitude has changed, with attempts to submit the issue to international arbitration. However, our position remains the same, as stated in numerous statements: We will conduct direct negotiations in accordance with treaties and other relevant diplomatic documents to ensure national sovereignty. The giant supply ship "Mawai" Ergon, which recently returned from the United States, has been ordered to load weapons, ammunition, and food and set sail to support the small number of national troops stationed on the islands to strengthen their defenses so as to prevent French troops who have not been ordered by the French government from acting arbitrarily and creating any situation that is more detrimental to harmonious negotiations.

[United Press, Nanjing, 24th] According to authoritative sources: The French Ambassador to China, Meyrier, will visit Vietnam within ten days to investigate the landing of French troops on the Paracel Islands. According to sources from the French Embassy: The landing of French troops on the Paracel Islands was not ordered by the French government. It is believed that it was the French troops stationed in Vietnam. After the Chinese side protested to the French government about this matter, the French side has softened its attitude. The French Ambassador's visit to Vietnam to investigate this matter is to prevent the expansion of this matter in the future.

[Our Correspondent in Xuzhou, 24th] The Communist troops, having amassed over 100,000 men in Southern Shandong, launched a large-scale offensive along the Taizao branch line, attempting to expand the internal strife and threaten Xuzhou. On the 5th of this month, they again launched their full force to attack the Zaozhuang coal mine, the largest coal producer in Central China. Zhou Yuying, commander of the 51st Division of the Nationalist army, was ordered to defend it with two divisions, with the aim of preserving a fraction of the nation's vitality. braving the severe weather of rain and snow, they fought against the Communist troops, who outnumbered them by more than thirty times. Although the Communist troops had broken into the positions several times, they were all bravely repelled. The Communist troops, having suffered nearly 30,000 casualties, concentrated all their forces on the 19th and launched a desperate and fierce attack on Zaozhuang, bombarding it with more than ten heavy artillery pieces and dozens of smaller cannons. The defending troops bravely resisted, repeatedly counter-attacking, the sound of battle shaking the heavens and the earth, blood and flesh flying everywhere. By the afternoon of the 24th, the Zaozhuang coal mine, which the army and the people had jointly defended with bloodshed and hard fighting for fifteen days and nights, was finally captured by the Communist troops due to the vast disparity in numbers, the complete destruction of the fortifications, and the exhaustion of ammunition. Commander Zhou was loyal to the Party and the country, having done his utmost and died a heroic death. In recent days, the Communist troops have again invaded westward along both sides of the Linzao branch line, attempting to seize Lincheng. A strong Nationalist force is currently offering strong resistance. Furthermore, Taierzhuang is still firmly held by the Nationalist army and remains safe and sound. After the Nationalist army gained control of the eastern section of the Longhai Railway, it quickly carried out mopping-up operations. At present, there are no large groups of Communist troops harassing the area south of the Longhai Railway in Northern Jiangsu.

[United Press, Nanjing, 24th] Yan'an Radio broadcast today that Chen Yi's troops of the Communist Party, after fierce fighting with the Nationalist 51st Division, occupied the important city of Zaozhuang in Southern Shandong on the 20th of this month, inflicting 11,000 casualties on the Nationalist army. The Ministry of National Defense has acknowledged the fall of Zaozhuang, but the spokesman of the ministry stated that the number of casualties of the Nationalist army reported by the Communist Party was "absurd." Zaozhuang was too far from the Nationalist defense line, and was defended by only a small number of troops, so it was abandoned.

[Our Correspondent in Xuzhou, 24th] More than 2,000 Communist troops, having sneaked from near on the 20th, reached the Weiji area, more than ten miles north of Suining, and were driven back by the garrison troops. By the 22nd, there was no trace of Communist troops within Suining.

[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 24th] After the eastern section of the Longhai Railway line was completely controlled by the Nationalist army, the Communist troops in the Zaozhuang area actively adjusted their deployment. Since the 22nd, they have successively passed through Chongfang (50 kilometers east of Yixian) and the area north of Matouzhen, crossed the Yishui River eastward, and seem to be concentrating their main forces on the line east and west of Yicheng and Matouzhen, in order to harass again. (Another report) Small groups of Communist troops have recently sneaked to the southeast of Yutai, and there are signs of them attempting to sneak into Yutai.

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 23rd] According to sources concerned: The Communist radio station of the Changchun Military Mediation Department was sealed off by the local military authorities because the Communist side used the radio station to secretly communicate with the Communist army in Northeast China, facilitating the Communist army's launch of offensives. The local military authorities had no choice but to take this measure for self-defense. (The Communist radio station has now been returned; see this newspaper on the 21st.) According to the Government side radio station of the Executive Headquarters, it had also been sealed off by the Communist side several times before. It is reported that the Government side radio station of the 5th Group in Zhangjiakou was confiscated by the Communist representative leading troops at 6:30 pm on September 18, 1946, and the protest was ineffective. Furthermore, the Government side radio station of the 1st Executive Group in Jining was confiscated by the Communist side at 10:30 pm on September 4, 1946, due to the Communist side's excuse of the then military situation, prohibiting communication.

Nationalist Troops Withdraw from Wangdu, Regimental Commander Unfortunately Captured

[Our Correspondent in Baoding, 24th] Since the 19th, the Communist troops, with three brigades, have besieged Wangdu. The Nationalist army in the area recently added a regiment, but it was still outnumbered. After fierce fighting, at 10 pm on the 22nd, the local garrison of more than 700 men, led by regimental commander Zhao Hezhen, voluntarily withdrew from the county seat in good order, heading north. Near Fangshunqiao, the Communist troops impersonated the Nationalist army unit number from Baoding and looted westward. When they reached Yujiazhuang Nanlangjiazhuang, the Nationalist army discovered the deception, and fierce fighting broke out again. Regimental commander Zhao Hezhen and more than 300 soldiers were captured. The remaining officers and soldiers, administrative personnel, and refugees, totaling 350 people, fled to Baoding (now living in Sipingzhuang, ten miles southwest of the city). The Baoding Emergency Relief Team has been distributing food and funds since the 21st to provide temporary relief.

Nationalist Troops Confident of Opening Baoshi Railway

[Our Correspondent in Baoding, 24th] Amidst the tense situation in Baoding, the reporter interviewed various parties concerned on the 22nd. It was said that the Communist troops outside Baoding were actively moving, attempting to attack the provincial capital and destroy the Pinghan Railway traffic again, which is highly propagandistic. In the current situation, the Nationalist army in Baoding is strong and mostly composed of mechanized elite troops. Although the Communist troops stationed outside the city walls for fifteen miles number more than 60,000, the units with good equipment and combat effectiveness are less than one-third. In terms of combat, the Nationalist army has an absolute advantage. The Communist troops relocated to the west of Baoding and gathered frequently, attempting to stir up trouble. Their intention is nothing more than to seize opportunities to harass or make a show of force. Furthermore, the Nationalist defense line is long and it is impossible for sentry posts to be connected one after another. The Communist troops attack the weak and avoid the strong, resulting in the struggle for small strongholds, local battles, and traffic accidents, which are inevitable. If the Communist troops want to recreate the situation in the northern section of the Pinghan Railway last year, it is currently impossible. As for the opening of the Baoshi section, the Nationalist army is absolutely confident. However, Baoding is currently fully defending against the activities of the Communist troops in western Hebei, and the opening of this section is only a matter of time.

### Xue Dubi Replies to Dong Biwu Again, Narrating the Truth about the Damming Project

Tearfully Pleads for the People in the Yellow River and Huai River Basins

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 24th] Regarding the Yellow River damming and restoration project, the Communist Party has repeatedly obstructed it. Xue Dubi, chairman of the Water Conservancy Commission, after receiving a letter from Communist representative Dong Biwu on January 15 inquiring about various matters, specifically replied to Mr. Dong again, fully answering the true facts as follows:

(1) Our committee had only one conversation with your representative on May 18, 1946, because your party had disagreements with the Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission after discussing it. Therefore, representative Zhao Mingfu and others were sent to Nanjing to directly consult with our committee. The minutes of that conversation should be regarded as the basic agreement between the two parties. All progress on the Yellow River damming and restoration project should be based on that agreement. As for the so-called minutes and agreements of previous meetings in your letter, our committee did not participate in them, so it is not bound by them.

Delay in Dyke Construction in Communist Areas Cannot be Attributed to the Central Government

(2) The minutes of the May 18th conversation stipulated that regarding the restoration project, it was agreed that "the downstream urgent restoration project, including dangerous works and partial straightening of river banks, should be completed first, and the entire project should be planned and promoted together" (Original Record 1-1), "The funds required for the urgent project will be fully allocated by the Water Conservancy Commission" (Original Record 1-3), "This restoration work should strive to start construction before June 5" (Original Record 1-4), "Construction matters in the Communist area shall be handled by the Communist Party" (Original Record 1-5). There was a clear agreement on the nature of the project, the completion steps, and the responsibilities for handling it. All the funds required for the urgent project in your area were first transferred to your party in three batches in June and July last year by our committee. Subsequently, consultant Todd went to your area for an on-site investigation and believed that the funds allocated by our committee, together with the grain allocated by the General Relief Administration, were sufficient for the project you did. It can be seen that the Central Government has fulfilled its responsibility to fully allocate the funds required for the urgent project in accordance with Article 3 of the original record. However, your letter stated that the government still owes 4.9 billion yuan and that there is no solution for the funds for straightening dangerous works, which is obviously inconsistent with the facts. As for your letter stating that (straightening dangerous works has not started at all, and the downstream restoration project has been completely suspended since July), it has been found that the downstream restoration project is being handled by the Hebei Repair and Defense Office, and it has been reported that as of December 10 last year, the completed earthwork was (526,899) cubic meters. In Shandong, it is being handled by the Shandong Repair and Defense Office, and it has been reported that as of the end of December last year, the completed earthwork was (866,072) cubic meters. As for the Communist area, it is being handled by your party. According to consultant Todd's inspection report, the completed earthwork was (10,620,000) cubic meters. Both parties have been actively carrying out the downstream restoration work for a long time, and your party has long received the aforementioned funds and grain. If there is a delay in the dyke construction in the Communist area, the responsibility should be borne by your party and cannot be attributed to the Central Government.

Failure to Dam Downstream Will Inevitably Cause a Tragedy

(3) The minutes of the May 18th conversation stated that (regarding the relocation and relief of residents within the downstream river channel, the Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission has submitted a case for approval, and requested the Central Government to designate it for handling as soon as possible, so as to meet the needs of the damming and restoration project). It is reported that more than 30,000 residents in the Yellow River old channel in the Central Government-controlled areas of Henan and Hebei have automatically moved out because they heard that the Yellow River would return to its old channel, and have not requested relief. As for the number of residents in the river channel in your party's area of Shandong, the Central Government cannot find out, and the numbers you have repeatedly submitted are inconsistent, and the number of relocations required is sometimes 15 billion and sometimes 30.4 billion, which makes it even more impossible for the Central Government to know the truth. If you want to conduct an investigation, you have no way to start, so you have to consider it carefully. Fortunately, the funds have been fully allocated to the General Relief Administration by the government, and it is no longer a problem.

(4) The May 18th conversation minutes stipulated that the damming project should (continue to proceed, with the principle of not causing flooding downstream). Our committee not only did not ignore it, but also paid close attention to it long ago. Therefore, during the flood season, we were determined to maintain a cautious attitude and did not dare to actively rush to advance. At present, during the dry season, we must speed up construction, so as to catch up with the time period, which is precisely to make the water slowly flow into the old channel, so that local officials and people along the river can inspect the water flow situation and carry out the repair and maintenance of the embankment work, so as to avoid disasters downstream. The work of repairing dikes has always been carried out at this time. Today, your letter stated that (the government does not care about the downstream dyke work, does not care about the lives and property of the residents in the downstream river channel, but only limits the time for damming), which is completely contrary to the facts. If the damming is postponed for five months according to your party's proposal, it is precisely when the flood season is approaching. If the damming is carried out at that time, not only will there be major technical difficulties and it will be difficult to close the gap, but even if it can be closed, the flood will flow eastward and cause unimaginable floods downstream. As your letter stated, it will be a (world-rare tragedy). The Central Government treats compatriots across the country equally and cannot follow your party's wishes and tolerate this worst policy.

The So-Called Early Water Release is Actually a Communist Pretext

(5) Your letter also blamed us for (releasing water before damming without notifying your party). Regarding this point, please first briefly explain the damming method, and then you can get a reasonable answer. This damming adopted the flat damming method, that is, first use wooden beams to build a temporary bridge to connect the two ends of the breach, and then throw stones from the bridge to form a stone dam to block the water flow, so that the water level gradually rises. At the same time, several ditches are dug in the high places between the water flow and the old channel, so that when the water level rises to a considerable level, the river water gradually enters the old channel through these ditches, which is called the diversion channel. This is the pre-determined plan before construction. In the May 18th conversation minutes, the reservation opinion raised by your party representative only stated that diversion channels should not be dug before the flood season. It can be seen that this construction step was originally very clear. The water passing through the diversion channel on the 27th of last month was caused by the increase in water level and infiltration. This is a natural result of throwing stones to dam the breach. How can it be called (early release of water). Moreover, your party representatives have been stationed at the Huayuankou construction site since the beginning to make contact and liaison. They must fully understand the progress of the project and must report to your party at any time. The announcement No. 2 of the Huang Character of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region Government of your party, the Ji-Lu-Yu Administrative Office, on November 11 last year, notified the people that the water would return to the old channel and ordered them to quickly move out of the riverbed. This was still forty-seven days before the diversion channel overflowed on December 27 last year, which shows that your party had long known and prepared for the natural result of throwing stones to dam the breach. Now, it is shirking responsibility for not knowing. Who will believe it? If it is said that the Beijing and Shanghai newspapers on the 2nd and 3rd of this month carried reports that Kaifeng, Heze, and Jinan, where the government troops were stationed, were prepared early, compared with your party, I am afraid that the preparation is not as early as your party.

Hoping for Compassion to Avoid Failure

(6) As for saying that our committee "is unwilling to stop the damming project, unwilling to stop the release of water, and takes the pretext of protecting the new flood area, actually inundating the old river area, which will inevitably have serious consequences," whether this serious consequence can occur depends entirely on the situation of your party repairing the downstream embankment. Looking at the above-mentioned announcement of the Ji-Lu-Yu Administrative Office of your party, it has already been rushing to repair the embankment and relocate residents, and it is estimated that it has been completed. Even if it has not been completed, it can be rushed now, so it is delaying repairs, which is watching the disaster of more than 7 million people downstream without prevention. Your party should bear the responsibility for this. From a technical point of view, the damming project is really not to be delayed at this time, because the damming stone dam is made of thrown rubble. The current water level has been raised, and the water pressure on the stone dam is very large. The water flow rushing up and down is enough to destroy the entire dam. If it does not advance, it will retreat. Once it stops, all the work will be abandoned. Moreover, the stone dam design uses the low water flow in winter for construction. Now is the most critical time for rushing to dam. Judging from the current width of the gap, if the flow of Shanzhou exceeds 1,500 cubic meters per second, there will be a great danger, and the ice jam season is approaching. Once the ice floes flow downstream, the temporary bridge and the stone dam will be destroyed together. Even if the ice jam season can be survived, the danger will be even greater during the peach flood season three months later. The completed project will inevitably be destroyed. Therefore, the stone throwing work must continue. As for sealing the gap and cutting off the flow, it may be slowed down a little. This situation was discussed in detail in Shanghai yesterday. This should be understood by your party.

There is still something to say. Our committee is a career organization, only knows to work hard for Yongli construction, and is extremely willing to do its utmost to get the joint cooperation of all parties, so that this water conservancy undertaking related to people's livelihood and national economy can proceed smoothly, so as not to fail the country and not to be ashamed of the people. My compatriots in Henan, Jiangsu, and Anhui provinces have suffered from the ravages of the Japanese invaders and the disasters of floods during the eight-year war of resistance. Now, it has been more than a year since the victory, and these people are still in dire straits. The heart of compassion is common to everyone. Even if there are differences in political views, how can we bear to let this Yellow River damming and restoration project, which is about to be completed, fail because of the war? I sincerely plead for the fathers and folks in the Yellow River and Huai River Basins with a red heart and tears, hoping for compassion and helping this completed achievement. I will be grateful to the utmost.

### Chairman Orders Guangxi Provincial Government to Levy Sufficient Land Tax within a Time Limit

[Our Correspondent in Guilin, 24th] Chairman Chiang ordered the provincial government by hand, as the time limit for the Guangxi province's in-kind levy of land tax has passed, and less than 60% has been collected, to collect the full amount by the end of the month.

### Our Consul in Jambi Arrives in Batavia, Announces Indonesian Military Atrocities, More Than a Thousand Overseas Chinese Killed and Injured, Bodies Dismembered

[Central News Agency, Batavia, 22nd] Our Consul in Jambi, Chen Yuanping, arrived here by plane this afternoon, and is scheduled to visit Indonesian Prime Minister Sjahrir with our Consul General in Batavia, Chiang Chiadong, tonight. Mr. Chen will also provide Sjahrir with photos of the dismembered bodies of overseas Chinese killed in Indonesian atrocities, as well as photos of overseas Chinese houses destroyed by Dutch artillery fire and Indonesian arson. He said during an interview with reporters: According to reports and observations received before the 17th of this month, it is estimated that 250 overseas Chinese were killed, thousands were lightly and seriously injured, and more than 600 were missing in Jambi alone. Currently, 6,000 people have registered to request relief from Chinese organizations. This number is not the final figure, as it has been discovered that some overseas Chinese have been kidnapped and assassinated by Indonesian elements. Regarding the property losses of overseas Chinese, Mr. Chen estimated the figure to be 5 million Straits dollars. He believes that both the Dutch and Indonesians should be responsible for this loss. He said: There were no street battles in Jambi. The Dutch army caused this unnecessary disturbance by using artillery and aircraft to assist naval gunboats in bombing the city. The armed Indonesian troops took advantage of this chaotic situation to burn, kill, loot, and plunder before retreating to a place 20 kilometers away from the city. It is learned that the Dutch army only had one soldier killed who was holding a hand grenade before the war, and another soldier died in the hospital. It is also reported that the Sumatran Indonesian authorities announced that a total of five Indonesians died, so the Dutch and Indonesians only had a total of seven deaths in the war. Consul Chen said: There is a severe shortage of food in Jambi. The relief ships from Singapore have not yet arrived. The Dutch authorities only provide the injured with a small amount of medicine. Overseas Chinese and the Indonesian authorities are currently trying to rescue the overseas Chinese kidnapped by Indonesian troops and have organized four Chinese-Indonesian rescue teams. One of them went to work in the countryside on the 20th, and the other teams will also start working soon.

### Zhou Fohai's Death is Not Far Off

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 24th] After Zhou Fohai was sentenced to death by the Criminal Division of the Supreme Court, the entire case and the judgment have been sent to the Ministry of Justice for review. The Capital High Court and Zhou Fohai have not yet received the sentence review, and the execution has not been scheduled. At 3 pm on the 24th, the reporter went to the Laohuqiao Detention Center to inquire about Zhou Fohai's recent situation. His wife, Yang Shuqian, brought one child each to visit the prison and was talking in the office. Zhou was wearing a blue cloth shirt and a small black velvet hat, with a pale face and weak speech. His wife's face was full of grief and anger. Under the supervision of the prison staff, they talked until 4 pm before saying goodbye. According to the prison staff, Zhou's heart disease has been severe recently, and his blood pressure is quite high. He has been lying quietly all day. On the 24th, he was granted permission to meet with his family. When his wife first arrived, she was sobbing uncontrollably. Later, after the prison told her that the sentence review had not yet been finalized, Zhou began to talk with tears. To this day, Zhou still does not know that his death is imminent.

### Fabricated a Story of Escaping Danger by Plane, Tried to Deceive the Mayor of Tianjin, Unsuccessful, Li Mou Went to Beiping

[Central News Agency, Tianjin, 24th] Half a month after the crash of China Airlines Flight 121 in Qingdao, a rogue named Li Zhidong fabricated a story and tried to swindle here. Li claimed to be a student in the 14th class of the military academy and a nephew of Li Mingyang. He visited Mayor Du Jianshi of the municipal government at 5:30 pm on the 20th and said that he was introduced by Chief Chen and intended to work in Tianjin. He came to Tianjin from Shanghai on China Airlines Flight 121, but unfortunately crashed in the sky over Qingdao. With his extraordinary wisdom, he climbed to the top of the toilet in the plane with both hands during the accident, avoiding the disaster. When Mayor Du asked about Chief Chen's letter of introduction, Li said that his property was completely destroyed due to the plane burning, and the letter of introduction was also among them. Mayor Du thought that Li's words were full of loopholes, so he told him that there were no vacancies in the police station here. Li saw that his plan was unsuccessful, and then asked to borrow money, saying that his travel expenses were also lost, so that he could go to Beiping to find a job, which was also rejected by Mayor Du. Li left in disappointment. When he stepped out of the city government hall, it happened that the field reporters of various newspapers came to the city government to interview the news of the day. Li took the opportunity to introduce himself and told the story of his encounter with danger and escape, and said that he lived in the Huizhong Hotel and his home was on Fulili Road in Shanghai, and that he had served as the commander of the 96th Army. The reporters thought that Li's description was vivid, and they all published it. The next day, they went to the Huizhong Hotel to visit again, and found out that there was no such person. After inquiring at the city government, they learned the truth. Li has now gone to Beiping. It is difficult to imagine whether he will use his old trick to swindle.

### Editorial: The United States Should Adopt a Bipartisan China Policy

Upon returning to Washington, D.C., on the morning of the 21st, the new U.S. Secretary of State, General of the Army George C. Marshall, was immediately sworn in at the White House as the 48th U.S. Secretary of State. The ceremony was simple and solemn. After the ceremony, he went to the State Department to take charge, embarking on the unfinished task of striving for world peace as envisioned by his predecessor, Secretary of State James F. Byrnes. From this point forward, a new chapter in the history of American diplomacy will unfold. Secretary of State Marshall, upon his return to Washington, D.C., made a brief statement: "I assume the position of Secretary of State without any political coloration; I shall restrain myself accordingly. Now and here is the best opportunity to put an end to any speculation about my future political activities. I will absolutely not get involved in the political vortex, nor can I be considered a candidate for any political office." General Marshall's statement still retained the essence of a military man. The appointment of a general as U.S. Secretary of State, initiated with General Marshall, has the major characteristic of transcending party lines and promoting a nationally unified foreign policy. In the current state of the United States, a Secretary of State who is detached from party affiliations and who adopts a joint foreign policy of both the Republican and Democratic parties is particularly necessary.

The foreign policy adopted by former Secretary of State Byrnes during his tenure received the unanimous support of both the Democratic and Republican parties, and can be regarded as a joint and consistent foreign policy of both parties. When Byrnes and Wallace had a dispute over foreign policy, although it caused a great uproar in political circles, Byrnes's position and reputation in the country remained unshaken because he was able to obtain the joint and unanimous support of both parties. On the contrary, Wallace had to resign as Secretary of Commerce and leave the Truman administration. However, when we examine the foreign policy adopted by Byrnes, the opinions of both parties were completely consistent on the European front, but on the Far East front, especially on the China policy, although there were no major differences in principle between the Democratic and Republican parties, there were still considerable differences. This distance is urgently needed to be eliminated in the current US government. General Marshall's promotion from Special Envoy to China to Secretary of State, his sole task is to synthesize the opinions of the Democratic and Republican parties and forge a joint and consistent Far East policy for the two parties of the United States. Therefore, it is known that General Marshall attaches importance to the China problem when he discussed the China problem with President Truman for the first time after taking office.

According to political observers, the US State Department is currently facing several pressing issues, including the following five: (1) The deterioration of US-Poland relations due to the Polish general election issue; (2) How to improve US-Soviet relations at the Moscow Four Foreign Ministers Conference to be held on March 10; (3) Solving the Argentina problem, as well as the entire Latin American problem; (4) Changes in the internal personnel of the State Department; (5) China issue, General Marshall intends to make a statement in the shortest possible time to clarify his statement when he left China. These are all pressing issues that need to be resolved quickly by the new Secretary of State, but the fact that General Marshall and President Truman discussed the China issue during their first meeting shows that General Marshall and President Truman attach particular importance to the China issue. Although the content of the meeting has not been officially released, outsiders cannot know it, but we can also guess its general idea.

At present, the vision of the Chinese and American peoples is completely concentrated in Washington, D.C., and everyone is watching whether the US government is still hesitant to provide material assistance to China's nation-building and revival. Taking the US loan of 500 million US dollars to China for nation-building and revival as an example, the US Export-Import Bank had already reserved funds ten months ago, but when General Marshall was mediating the conflict between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party in China, in order to promote a peaceful resolution of the internal conflict in China, he telegraphed the Export-Import Bank to retain this loan, which must be granted to the Chinese government only after domestic peace in China is realized, so that this loan is still in the vault of the US Export-Import Bank. However, the merits and demerits of this policy need to be reconsidered by General Marshall. Senator Vandenberg, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and a Republican senator, delivered a speech on the 11th, advocating that the United States should change its China policy, encourage political organizations other than the Chinese Communist Party to form a coalition government, and said that the United States should "encourage those who are extremely brave and dedicated to unification, and prevent those who harm unification." The distance between the US Republican Party and the government's China policy lies here. If General Marshall wants to shorten the distance between the two parties on the China issue after taking office as Secretary of State, he should pay special attention to Vandenberg's speech on the 11th.

In short, after General Marshall takes office as Secretary of State, his view on the China issue should no longer be in the position of mediator, haggling over fairness, but should start from a broad perspective, taking into account the objective reality on the one hand, and respecting the opinions of the Republican Party on the other hand, to formulate a joint China policy for the two parties. China must not disregard its nation-building and revival plan because the CCP refuses to abandon its attempt to seize power by force, and similarly, the United States cannot stop its aid to China plan because the CCP obstructs China's unification. The Chinese government has drafted a five-year economic recovery plan, similar to the Soviet Union's first five-year plan, the purpose of which is to lay a solid foundation for China's industrialization. The United States should morally assist this plan, and the previously agreed loan of 500 million US dollars should be quickly granted to China, so as to help the early success of China's nation-building and revival.

### New Standards for Living Allowances for Public Servants in Zhejiang Province The Central Government Approves Approximately 1 Billion Yuan per Month The Purchase of Public Grain is Reduced to 200,000 Dan

[Our Hangzhou Dispatch, 24th] Chairman Shen of Zhejiang Province received our reporter alone in his office on the 22nd. After Shen comprehensively discussed the current situation, he went on to talk about his recent trip to Beijing to report on his work, saying: The increased portion of the new standard for living allowances for public servants in Zhejiang Province has been allocated by the central government, amounting to approximately 1 billion yuan per month. The central government's purchase of public grain was originally 500,000 dan, but has been reduced to 200,000 dan after request. The 1 billion yuan reduction in taxes that should have been received has been allocated by the central government. All highways in this province must be rectified and restored within the year, requiring approximately 10 to 20 billion yuan, and a large portion of the subsidies can be approved. The central government's subsidies for administrative expenses in Zhejiang Province have reached over 20 billion yuan, but the provincial finances are still short by over 7 billion yuan, which still needs to be resolved through austerity. Finally, regarding the suspected corruption case in the Transportation Department, Shen said that he was aware of the matter and would resolve it through legal channels.

### Jiangxi Poyang People Request Repair and Dredging Poyang Lake Longkou Shipping Route

[Our Poyang News] Longkou on the east bank of Poyang Lake is a transportation artery for the Xin River, Chang River, and Le'an River, and the special products and agricultural products of Guangxin and Raozhou must pass through this line for shipping exports. This place is the throat of Nanchang and Jiujiang entering Rao Guang. The waterway is narrow, and when the water is dry in autumn and winter, the depth is less than a zhang, making navigation difficult and often encountering stagnation. During the Anti-Japanese War, dredging could not be carried out due to the fortification of the lake, and the silting has become even worse.

### Huai River Dredging Project

[Zhengyangguan News] The Huai River is the only major transportation artery between Zha and Zheng. After the water level drops in winter, the Mohekou, where the Ying River flows into the Huai River (three li from Zhengyangguan), is silted up by yellow river sediment, partially blocking the Zheng-Mo section of the Huai River, spanning about one li in width and over two li in length. This causes the downstream flow of the Huai River to be obstructed at Tujiayao (half a li from Zhengyangguan), forcing it to turn northeast and flow into the Huai River at Lujiakou (fifteen li from Zhengyangguan). As a result, the Zheng-Mo shipping route is detoured by forty li. The water level between Tujiayao and Lujiakou is too shallow, allowing only light sailboats to navigate. Small steamers from Bengbu to Zhengzhou cannot reach directly and can only anchor at Huhezhi, across from Mohekou. Consequently, passengers traveling to Bengbu must cross the river from the steamer pier to Qianyao and then walk two li to board the steamer. The roadbed in this section, which is exposed only after the water recedes, is made of stone chips and crushed grass. The road is dangerous, and great care must be taken to avoid drowning. It is even more difficult to traverse during rainy seasons, and the loading and unloading of goods is greatly inconvenienced. Mudtang Lake, Tangjia Lake, and Mengjia Lake in the middle reaches of the Huai River, which originally stored water, are unable to discharge their contents, leaving over one million hectares of farmland uncultivable. Nine out of ten farming families are impoverished, creating a desolate scene. People from all walks of life in this city eagerly hope that the Huai River Guidance Committee will dredge the riverbed as soon as possible to facilitate navigation and smooth the flow of water. It has recently been learned that, to overcome the current difficulties, the city's Chamber of Commerce has discussed dredging the Huai River with Zhu Jiadong, chief engineer of the third section works office of the Huai River Embankment Restoration Project under the Huai River Guidance Committee. According to reports, the siltation of the Huai River spans two li and is estimated to require 130,000 cubic meters of earthwork, costing approximately 30 million National Currency. A request has been submitted to the National Relief and Rehabilitation Administration for approval. Once approved, work will begin to dredge the river.

[Another Dispatch] According to a person from Tianjia'an, a brain congestion epidemic has recently been discovered in the mining area of the Huainan Mining and Railway Bureau.

The mine authorities are currently devising ways to provide relief.

### Agricultural Loan Methods and Procedures in the Recovered Areas of Huaihai Both Need Improvement

[Our Zhenjiang Dispatch, 24th] According to a gentleman who recently returned from a disaster investigation in Liansi Baoshu: In most rural areas of the recovered Huaihai region, only small copper coins are still in circulation. This clearly indicates that farmers in these areas lack the means to exchange agricultural products for legal tender in the market, and their livelihoods are disconnected from the current monetary system. Although the government has approved the issuance of substantial interest-free agricultural loans, the methods and procedures for disbursing these loans must be improved. If these loans fall into the hands of a few powerful individuals, the government's good intentions will not reach the countryside.

### Four Deputy Foreign Ministers Discuss German Peace Treaty; Australian Representative States Opinions; France Submits Memorandum to Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, Advocating a Decentralized Federal System for Germany

[Agence France-Presse, London, 23rd] The Quadripartite Deputy Foreign Ministers Conference continued, with the Australian representative, Hodgkinson, stating his views on the German peace treaty. He said that Germany's new borders, including its eastern border with Poland, should not be regarded as already determined. The Australian government believes that Germany's borders must be decided by a plenary meeting of the Allied powers. The need for a responsible German authority to sign the German peace treaty is certain, but the five powers should not prematurely establish a central government in Germany solely for this purpose. The best solution at present is to establish a "transitional agreement" signed only by the Allied powers, and then transform it into a German peace treaty, on which Germany should also sign. The agreement should be decided by a meeting of all Allied powers. All committees sent to Germany or established in Germany should also be composed of representatives of all Allied powers.

[Reuters, Washington, 23rd] The French government has submitted a memorandum to Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, proposing the abolition of the German parliament and the restoration of the pre-Bismarck political system, with a decentralized federation composed of more independent states. Although the memorandum has not yet been published, its contents are known to include the following key points: (1) Germany should be a federation, with the main powers belonging to the states, and the functions of the federal government limited to finance, food, transportation, postal and telecommunications, and some economic and diplomatic affairs. (2) The parliament of each state shall elect representatives every four years to form a federal council. (3) The Federal Council shall appoint a federal president annually, who shall appoint a government responsible for the first item. (4) The state governments shall be responsible for matters other than the first item, and may establish their own police, appoint judges of the Supreme Court, appoint ambassadors to foreign countries, and conduct negotiations with foreign countries, but may not merge with foreign countries or enter into alliances. (5) International treaties concluded with Germany must be approved by a two-thirds majority of the Federal Council.

### Major Changes in U.S. Naval Leadership

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 22nd] The Navy Department here announced that most of the commanders of the U.S. Navy will be changed.

### Southern Country Makes Demands to Restrict Austrian Troops, Causing Repercussions in Austria

[Agence France-Presse, London, 22nd] The Yugoslav representative, Vilfan, recently stated at the Quadripartite Deputy Foreign Ministers Conference the opinions of the Yugoslav government regarding the Austrian peace treaty, saying that all Austrian equipment used in the war should be destroyed and that all consequences of the German-Austrian merger should be cleared up. Austria's history has always been one of enslaving the Slavic people, and the last great war was caused by Austria, so its responsibility should be borne by the Austrians. Yugoslavia is most concerned about preventing Austrian Pan-Germanism, so it should severely limit the number of Austrian troops and completely eliminate its Nazi remnants. Vilfan then mentioned the request of the Southern Country to acquire the provinces of Carinthia and Styria, stating that the vast majority of the residents of these two provinces are Slavic and that incorporating them into the Southern Country can prevent Austria from once again controlling the fate of the Slavic people. Finally, he expressed the hope that the Allied powers would rebuild Austria in accordance with democratic principles, racial conditions, political needs, and moral principles.

[Reuters, London, 22nd] An Austrian official spokesman expressed surprise at Yugoslavia's request to the Quadripartite Foreign Ministers Conference that Austria not be allowed to have troops. The spokesman pointed out that the treaties of former German vassal states also allowed them to retain a small number of troops. Austria never allied with Hitler's Germany and was the first country to be victimized by Germany. If it is not allowed to have troops, it will not be able to maintain Austria's freedom and independence.

### Poland Demands Confirmation of Expanded Western Territory Fact

[Reuters, Warsaw, 22nd] The Polish delegation will submit a memorandum to the Quadripartite Foreign Ministers Conference next Monday, the main point of which is to recognize Poland's four borders in accordance with the provisions of the Potsdam Agreement. Regarding the future political status of Germany, Poland believes that it should be resolved in cooperation with the German people, under the principle of political unity, depending on the progress of Germany's democratic and peaceful reconstruction work. The memorandum also strongly argues that the principle of revenge should not be the basis for drafting the peace treaty, and that Germany's reconstruction and return to peace should be as a member of a rational and lasting international group.

According to a wounded soldier, the war in Vietnam is not an open war, but a war of terror and guerrilla warfare. The Viet Minh commando teams are mysterious and unpredictable. According to a French woman on the same ship, the Viet Minh army's massacre in Hanoi was even more brutal than the Japanese.

### Anglo-French Treaty in Drafting; Negotiations Between the Two Countries to Begin Soon; Anglo-Soviet Treaty Still Valid

[British Information Service, London, 24th] The draft Anglo-French treaty is being drafted by the British Foreign Office to serve as a blueprint for discussions between the British government and France.

[British Information Service, London, 24th] British Prime Minister Attlee stated in the House of Commons yesterday that former French Premier Blum had exchanged views extensively with the British government during his visit to Britain and reached agreements on a number of political and economic issues. In addition, it was decided that Britain and France would, in accordance with Article 52 of the United Nations Charter, immediately conclude a treaty after the establishment of the new French government to prevent Germany from rising again and to safeguard world peace. The British government does not intend to replace the Anglo-Soviet treaty with the Anglo-French treaty, because in fact a treaty between one country and an international organization cannot be replaced by another treaty. Moreover, the more alliances in the United Nations, the more beneficial it is to world peace. I hope that after the new French government is in place, both sides can begin negotiations on the alliance treaty.

Before leaving here for England, the Arab delegation reviewed the position it should adopt at the Round Table Conference with the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem. The delegation has now decided to propose the establishment of a representative democratic Palestinian state, in which the people currently living in Palestine, whether they are Jews or Arabs, will be granted citizenship. Muslims, Jews, and Christians will obtain seats in parliament in proportion to their numbers. The Arab delegation has also decided to demand that Britain cease its mandate over Palestine.

### Courts Are Working Tirelessly; Procedures for Amnesty and Release of Prisoners Will Be Completed Within Days; Over a Thousand People Have Been Released from Prisons and Detention Centers in Recent Days

[Report from Our Newspaper] Near the end of the lunar year, the courts are not taking a holiday and are busier than ever due to handling the procedures for amnesty and release of prisoners. According to Director Tian of the Sinan Road Detention Center, on the 21st (the lunar New Year's Eve), the detention center worked all night to process the release of prisoners, releasing a total of 649 people in one day and night, including seven female prisoners. On the 23rd (the second day of the New Year), a total of 63 people were released, and 18 people were also released yesterday. The detention center originally had more than 2,170 prisoners in custody. Since receiving the amnesty order on New Year's Day, more than 600 people have been released in succession, plus those who have served their terms and were released and those released in the last four days, totaling about 700 people. There are now only about 800 people left in the detention center. Cases that are obviously simple and meet the requirements of Clause A of the amnesty order have been actively processed by the District Court, and 70-80% of them have already been released. According to Chief Prosecutor Huang Liang of the District Prosecutor's Office, the special procedures for release will be completed in about two or three days.

In addition, the Shanghai Prison released 281 people on the 20th and another 612 people on the 21st (lunar New Year's Eve).

### Fire on Seymour Road Lasted 13 Hours; Residents' Discussions Varied, Warranting Attention

[Report from Our Newspaper] At 9:48 PM on the 22nd of this month (the first night of the lunar new year), a fire broke out at Wuding Road, Shaanxi North Road (i.e., Seymour Road), destroying a total of 13 structures and causing losses of over 2 billion yuan. The fire burned for 13 hours, which is unprecedented since the victory. Fortunately, no one was injured.

The fire started

in the 平房 house of a coppersmith at 425 Wuding Road. The cause of the fire is said to be an electrical short in the radio. At the time, the male owner of the shop was not home, and the female owner was flustered and did not take any rescue measures, but fled in a hurry, causing the fire to become uncontrollable. A row of 12 市房 houses at 660 Alley, Shaanxi North Road, including the Wuding Road Municipal National Central Elementary School, were all three-story buildings built five years before the founding of the Republic of China. The roofs were all constructed with lead sheets and wooden boards, with large gaps between the roof and the flat top, and they were connected to each other without firewalls. When the fire spread along the wind, the fire quickly spread like a mushroom cloud during an atomic bomb explosion. Although the fire brigade arrived to extinguish the fire, the fire was brewing in the interlayer. It was originally planned to split the lead sheet on the roof with an ax to let the fire pass through the roof, but the lead sheet was strong and tightly fastened, and the result was in vain. By about 3:00 AM on the 23rd, all the houses were surrounded by raging fire, and the strong wind helped the flames spread, with sparks flying everywhere, making the fire personnel who arrived on the scene helpless. After 10:00 AM, the fire gradually subsided, and they concentrated on extinguishing the fire, which was extinguished at 11:00 AM.

Afterwards,

reporters went to the fire site for inspection. In addition to the complete destruction of 425 Wuding Road where the fire started, the Yongqin Rubber Factory and the Shunkang Timber Company next door were also slightly affected, with minor losses. Houses at 29, 27, 25, 23, 21, 17, and 15 in Alley 66 next door were mostly destroyed, and houses at 13, 9, 7, 5, 3, and 1 were less damaged. Among them, 23 and 21 were the Municipal National Central Elementary School, and only the gatehouse on both sides was still intact, and the internal school equipment was completely destroyed. When the fire broke out, more than a dozen teachers and staff living in the school only managed to grab a few clothes and bedding, and the rest were turned to ashes. They had to temporarily stay in the nearby News Road Municipal Elementary School. Director of Education Gu Yuxiu had sent someone to express condolences and send 2 million yuan in relief money the day before.

The house at 29 was the residence of Wang Yunfu, manager of the Sanyou Industrial Company in this city, and there was a pig bristle workshop run by his eldest son. After the fire was extinguished, when inventorying the stored items, it was discovered that the safe had been pried open by others, and the gold bars and some 500 yuan in cosmetic and dressing bonds stored inside were missing.

At the same time,

nearby residents were talking a lot, and it was rumored that before the fire was extinguished, there had been requests for gold bars and talk of "jin tou" (a slang term for bribery). Everyone expressed extreme indignation at this. Before the facts are proven, we should not judge prematurely. However, there is no smoke without fire. Since there is such a rumor, the municipal authorities should thoroughly investigate the matter. Logically speaking, Shanghai has excellent fire-fighting equipment such as tap water and fire trucks, but it could not be quickly extinguished and allowed to burn for as long as 13 hours. The reason is really difficult to understand. We will not talk about the truth of this matter for the time being, but from the people's standpoint, we hope that the authorities will pay close attention in the future and hope that the fire-fighting administration will be strengthened, so as not to disappoint the city's 5 million citizens in the municipal measures.

### Amateur Radio Association to Hold Regular Social Gathering

### The Executive Yuan Made Winter Clothing and Gave to University Students; Second Batch to Be Distributed Starting Today

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Student Relief Committee, organized by the YMCA, will distribute the second batch of relief winter clothing donated by the Executive Yuan today. The winter clothing is made of black cloth on the outside, lined with washed white flour sacks, and filled with a large amount of cotton. All the raw materials are supplied by the China Textile Corporation. The sizes are all uniform, with only differences between men's and women's styles. The men's style is a short cotton jacket and pants, and the women's style is an ordinary-style cheongsam. The target of relief is only university students in this city who have poor family backgrounds. According to the person in charge there, registrations have been very enthusiastic, and most of them are university students who have returned to Shanghai from the interior. They were very awkward when they first wore the same style and color of winter clothing, but after a long time, more students wore them, and the weather was very cold, and there was a real need for them, so the feeling of embarrassment no longer existed. It is heard that more than a thousand people have registered, and the first batch has more than 500 sets of winter clothing, and the second batch will be distributed starting today, but the number is only more than 100 sets, which is still "more monks than congee."

### To Prevent Smallpox Epidemic, Compulsory Vaccination Is to Be Held; The General Organization Is to Be Hosted by the Epidemic Prevention Committee; A Promotion Association Is to Be Established Before February 1

The number of smallpox patients in this city has been increasing recently. There were 20 people in the first ten days of January and 58 people in the middle ten days, for a total of 78 people, which is more than in the previous months, and there is a tendency for an epidemic. The Municipal Health Bureau, according to the decision of the First Municipal Council, will implement compulsory vaccination starting from February 1 to prevent the recurrence of smallpox in this year. The Health Bureau has decided that the Shanghai Municipal Epidemic Prevention Committee will be the general organization for hosting vaccination, and will unite with all sectors to establish compulsory vaccination promotion associations in each administrative autonomous region before February 1. Vaccination general teams will be established throughout the city, and vaccination brigades and three-person teams (with a minimum of 400 teams) will be established in each district promotion association to be responsible for publicity, vaccination, and inspection in their respective districts. In addition, all public and private medical institutions and practicing physicians in the city are requested to set up 500 fixed vaccination stations to vaccinate with cowpox. It is planned to formally establish all the above teams and stations on February 8. Regarding the promotion of vaccination, the Health Bureau has also formulated measures: (1) The spring vaccination will use February 1 to 9 as the publicity date, using slogans, notices, newspaper advertisements, movies, and lectures to arouse public attention. February 9 to 28 will be the first phase of total mobilization, adopting a persuasive approach. Vaccination certificates will be issued by the Health Bureau after vaccination. March 1 to April 30 will be the second phase of total mobilization, forcibly implementing vaccination certificates, and conducting a general inspection of spring vaccination certificates for land and water transportation and all citizens of the city. (2) The autumn vaccination will use September 16 to 20 as the publicity date, September 21 to October 31 as the first phase of total mobilization, and November 1 to November 30 as the second phase of total mobilization. All vaccination methods are the same as in spring. (3) The Municipal Government will order all public and private schools, nurseries, shelters, prisons, factories, and various industrial and commercial groups in the city to vaccinate within a time limit. (4) The Municipal Government will order all hospitals, industrial physicians, and midwives in the city to implement vaccination for newborns. It is heard that the above vaccination funds have been submitted by the Health Bureau to the Municipal Government and will be allocated to the Shanghai Municipal Epidemic Prevention Committee in installments from the epidemic prevention funds for use according to the budget. The Shanghai Municipal Epidemic Prevention Committee is scheduled to invite relevant agencies in the city to hold a meeting at the YMCA in Bāxiānqiáo at 3:00 PM this afternoon to discuss the implementation of compulsory vaccination.

Since the implementation of intensified winter prevention by the police bureau at the end of the old lunar year, theft cases have been almost extinct to this day.

[Another Dispatch] Mayor Wu allocated 20 million yuan on the lunar New Year's Eve to reward the capable police officers who performed well during the winter prevention period, and ordered the police bureau to send people to comfort the families of the police officers who were injured or killed in the line of duty last year.

### Barber's Love Triangle; Stabbed Four Times While Sound Asleep

[Report from Our Newspaper] At about 3:00 AM yesterday, barber Dai Hengchang, 33, from Yangzhou, at the Chunfeng Barber Shop, No. 706, the intersection of Zhongzheng East Road and Yunnan Road, was suddenly broken into by a murderer while he was sound asleep, who stabbed him four times in the arms and face with a knife.

After reporting to the Laozha Sub-bureau to send police to investigate, it was learned that it was a love triangle dispute.

### Purchased a Place for Allied Guests to Rest

The house at No. 1235, Route Pétain, has recently been purchased by the government as a permanent address for receiving foreign guests.

The previous rumor that UNRRA had purchased a new residence for General Egerton has been officially denied by the UNRRA spokesperson. It is said that "UNRRA originally planned to find a residence for General Egerton, but the authorities stated that relief funds could not be used for other purposes, so the Central Trust of China purchased a property to temporarily lend to UNRRA to receive General Egerton. The house is like Blair House in Washington, D.C., and any Allied guests received by the government will temporarily reside there. It is actually a permanent reception center for the government, and General Egerton is only staying there temporarily."

### Spies and Robbers Almost Caused Trouble; Police Officers on Zhejiang Road Pursued and Opened Fire; It Was Learned that the Dispute Arose from Gambling over Money

[Report from Our Newspaper] At about 9:00 PM on the 21st, the staff of the Tianhe Dyeing Factory at No. 38, North Zhejiang Road, were gathering in the shop to gamble on pai gow. Wu Xuequn and two unknown people went to participate.

After taking him to the police station for interrogation, it was learned that Wu Xuequn would be charged with fraud, and Sun Shengdong and Fu Zhiliang would be charged with false accusation, and they would be transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for interrogation and prosecution.

### How Many People Lost Their Integrity and Became Traitors? – Statistics on Trials of Hanjians – From October of the Year Before Last to Recently – Four Hundred and Three Convicted by the High Court

[Special Report from This Newspaper] During the eight years of the national War of Resistance Against Japan, how many people fought loyally for the revival of the nation, and how many lost their integrity, flattered the enemy, and became traitors, acting out a historical farce? This was an unprecedented test. The hypocrisy usually hidden behind masks was ruthlessly revealed in the mirror of history. Taking Shanghai as an example, according to statistics from the High Procuratorate from January 1, 1946, to December 31, 1946, 853 cases were prosecuted against suspected Hanjians, 79 were not prosecuted, 138 were wanted, and 73 were transferred.

To give readers a complete picture, the reporter has compiled the High Court's verdicts on Hanjians that have been published in the newspaper. Now, they have been sorted out, covering the period from October 1945, to January 18 of this year, and divided into several categories according to the severity of the sentences.

### Unprecedented Feat in Civil Aviation History – Giant Plane "Nanjing" Flies Across the Pacific – Arrived at Midway Island Yesterday and Flew to San Francisco – Inspecting and Planning Sino-U.S. Air Route Along the Way

Since the signing of the Sino-U.S. aviation agreement, China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) has been actively preparing to open the Sino-U.S. air route. The company dispatched a special plane with more than 20 of its technical personnel from Jiangwan Airport at 4:00 a.m. the day before yesterday to test the flight to the United States. This is the first Chinese civil aviation plane to fly to the United States in history and the first flight to the United States in the 18 years since the establishment of CNAC. The plane is a four-engine DC-4 giant plane, named "Nanjing," with the international identifier XPP02. It took off from Shanghai at 4:00 a.m. the day before yesterday and arrived in Guam at 1:15 p.m. that afternoon. It then left Guam at 8:56 p.m. that night, flying via Wake Island to Midway Island. CNAC received a telegram yesterday stating that the plane did not land or stay at Wake Island and flew directly to Midway Island, arriving at 12:45 p.m. yesterday. It is scheduled to fly to Honolulu today and is expected to arrive in San Francisco on the 27th or 28th. It is scheduled to fly back to Shanghai on the 7th or 8th of next month. The plane also carried some mail on this trip. According to Mr. Wu, the person in charge of the company, the mission of the "Nanjing" flight to the United States is to investigate the stations, meteorology, repair equipment, and other facilities along the Sino-U.S. air route to prepare for the opening of the Sino-U.S. route by Chinese civil aviation planes. Mr. Wu also said that Chinese civil aviation planes are gradually expanding abroad. On August 26 last year, a CNAC plane made its first transoceanic flight to Manila. On September 28 of the same year, it flew to Tokyo, becoming the first Chinese civil aviation plane to fly to Japan in history. On January 23 of this year, there was another first in history with this civil aviation plane flying to the United States. After this plane returns to China, the Sino-U.S. air route will be officially opened.

### More Than a Thousand Passengers Rescued from Zhijiang Steamer

The circumstances of the sinking of the Zhijiang steamer off the coast of Wusong have been reported in previous newspapers. Regarding the exact number of passengers and crew members rescued from the ship, according to a report from the Wusong Branch of the Jianghai Customs Port Police Department, 773 people were rescued by the department, and 46 were rescued by Chinese naval warships, all of whom were taken back to Shanghai. In addition, more than 100 people rescued by six pig-exporting boats have already left the country with the sailing ships. According to the Port Police Department, fortunately, the rescue was carried out early after the ship's accident, so the number of casualties was not as high as rumored.

[Another Report] When the Zhijiang steamer sank off the coast of Wusong, the Zhongquan warship was conducting exercises in the area. Upon hearing the news, it immediately dispatched a motorboat to provide assistance, rescuing many people. Most of those rescued voluntarily took a car to Shanghai without registering their names. The remaining sixty people and a small amount of luggage were assisted by the officers and soldiers of the warship to board the ship. They were provided with food and clothing and sailed into Gaochang Temple before disembarking on their own.

### Staff of Zhabei Police Department Donate Food Savings to Help Refugees

Zhi Chun, the director of the Zhabei Police Department in this city, is very concerned about the refugees in this city. Recently, the city's Winter Relief Association organized shelters for the cold. He initiated a food-saving campaign among all police officers, raising 20 dan of rice. The China Vegetable Oil Factory of the Ministry of Economic Affairs donated three buckets of soybean oil to the police department. All of these were sent to the shelters to provide food for the refugees, demonstrating admirable enthusiasm.

### Anti-Tuberculosis Stamp Campaign – Hoping for Continued Donations

The Shanghai Anti-Tuberculosis Association launched a stamp sales campaign in December of last year to make up for the funding shortage of the two hospitals run by the association. According to Huang Jiali, the secretary-general of the association, the campaign has received enthusiastic donations from various schools, institutions, banks, and businesses in the city. As of now, the donations received have reached more than 5 million national currency. However, this is still far from the association's original target of 10 million yuan. It is hoped that all sectors of the city will continue to donate generously. It is heard that the design of this year's anti-tuberculosis stamps has been decided to use the portrait of the association's late honorary secretary and hospital director, Dr. Hinder, an American. Dr. Hinder devoted himself to anti-tuberculosis work in Shanghai, pioneering the work with great effort. The association has given him this honor to commend his contributions.

### American Churches Donate Dairy Cows to China – More Than Seven Hundred Arrive in Shanghai – Including More Than Forty Newborn Calves – To Be Distributed to Schools and Hospitals

[Report from This Newspaper] The first batch of more than 700 dairy cows donated by American churches to China departed from New Orleans on the Atlantic coast of the United States on December 19 of last year on the S.S. Linderwood Victory. They crossed the Gulf of Mexico, passed through the Panama Canal, and traveled a long distance across the ocean, arriving in Shanghai on the morning of the first day of the Lunar New Year. Unloading began yesterday.

Unable to Bear the Homesickness

On the bank of the Qiujiang Wharf, this batch of "cows from a foreign land" stepped out of the crane and onto foreign soil for the first time. Most of them hesitated to move forward, as if they could not bear their "homesickness."

When the dairy cows boarded the ship in the United States, there were a total of 715 heads. During the journey, due to the tossing of the ocean and the influence of the tropical climate, 18 died of illness. Thirty-seven calves were born on the ship. After arriving in Shanghai, two more were born on the previous two days. Therefore, the actual number of cows landed in Shanghai was 697 (including 19 bulls) and 41 calves.

Approximately Six Gallons of Milk Per Day

It is reported that more than 90 of them unfortunately had miscarriages during the journey, otherwise, the number of "newborn calves" would be even greater. The appearance of these dairy cows is not as tall and strong as imagined, and they all have a sense of "weariness" after a long sea journey. According to the manager, the average milk production is six gallons per head per day, and the best can produce up to eight gallons, depending on the environment, climate, and proper feeding. Their average age is between one and three years. They are produced in various parts of the United States, and the market price is about US$160 per head. The freight is borne by the UN Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA). It is estimated that the cost from the United States to Shanghai is more than US$200 per head.

More Large Batches Will Continue to Be Shipped to China

All the dairy cows are donated by the Church Service Committee, an organization of American churches. The initial initiator was the Baptist Church. Before the Second World War, during the Spanish Civil War, some church members witnessed the tragic situation of local people lacking food and nutrition in Spain. They were deeply moved and initiated fundraising for dairy cows after returning to the United States, but the work was terminated due to the outbreak of the war. After the war, this work was continued, and many cows have been donated to Poland, Italy, and other countries. A total of more than 2,000 heads will be donated to China and will be shipped in succession. The more than 700 heads that have arrived in Shanghai are currently being raised by the UNRRA Shanghai Animal Husbandry Station. They will be delivered to the recipient organizations in a week. The distribution quotas have been determined by the UNRRA authorities. The recipients are schools, hospitals, and other institutions related to the church, with the most going to the schools for the descendants of martyrs in the capital.

### The Telecommunications Bureau Uses the Spring Festival to Improve Long-Distance Telephone Lines

[Report from This Newspaper] The Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau is taking advantage of the Lunar New Year holiday to thoroughly test internal machines and lines and strive to improve long-distance telephones in order to reduce the "transmission attenuation" from the "carrier terminal" through the long-distance radio station to the households in western Shanghai.

Since the opening of the express long-distance telephone service, in addition to replacing the original Japanese carrier telephone machines between Beijing and Shanghai with American-style components, there are plans to install load coils on the "relay cables" at both ends of Beijing and Shanghai to improve the sound quality. In Shanghai, because of the connection with the equipment of the Shanghai Telephone Company, the Shanghai Telecommunications Bureau has initiated weekly joint technical meetings with the Shanghai Telephone Company to discuss and cooperate in improving the system. It is reported that an agreement has been reached to adjust the equipment at the "Fujian Road Bureau" that is connected to the long-distance service and to add 15 pairs of long-distance relay lines. The Telecommunications Bureau will provide some of the materials required.

### British Officer Holds Medal Awarding Ceremony for Achievements Along the Chinese Coast – British Consul General in Shanghai Presides in Person

[Report from This Newspaper] The British Consulate General in this city, under the order of the British government, held a ceremony yesterday afternoon to award medals to military officers who made heroic achievements along the Chinese coast during the war. The ceremony was presided over by the British Consul General in Shanghai, Okeden.

### Social Service – Continuous Rainy Weather and Severe Cold During the Spring Festival – This Newspaper Will Begin Distributing Winter Clothing from the 28th

Hoping that Destitute, Unemployed, Elderly, Disabled, and Bereaved Children Will Receive Aid on Time

Continuous rainy weather and severe cold during the Spring Festival, with howling winds cutting to the bone. The general situation of the poor compatriots, struggling on the brink of starvation, lacking food and clothing, and having no shelter, is truly beyond description. After a long period of planning, the Shanghai Branch of the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) has finally made the "Distribution of Winter Clothing" a reality. Although the small number of items is not enough to provide warmth to the vast number of hungry and cold masses, it is indeed unexpected good news for the poor compatriots who are eagerly awaiting it!

This distribution of winter clothing is limited to the destitute and unemployed who are truly in need, with priority given to the elderly, disabled, and bereaved children, so that these poor compatriots can receive comfort as soon as possible. The Shanghai Branch of UNRRA has entrusted various charitable organizations in this city to handle this distribution. This newspaper has been entrusted to distribute 400 pieces and will receive them within days. It is hereby announced that the distribution will begin on the 28th of this month, from 9:00 a.m. to 12:00 noon every day, at this office. Those who need this winter clothing should prepare a receipt, bring their identity card, household registration certificate, or other proof of identity, and come to the office to wait for their turn until all the clothing is distributed. However, those whose documents are inconsistent or have already received clothing elsewhere will not be given any.

### Speaking Out for the Lonely, Widowed, Poor, and Sick – Saving and Helping Others is a Great Merit

Qingxia Lonely, Widowed, Poor, and Sick Relief Fund Raising Donations

During the Lunar New Year, people of all ages and genders welcome a pleasant day with excitement and joy. In wealthy families, children put on new clothes, and their pockets are filled with candy. Adults feast on each other in lavish luxury, spending thousands of dollars in one go. But what about the poor? They are still struggling on the brink of starvation, unable to keep warm or eat their fill, at the mercy of fate. But can we watch them freeze and starve without feeling any compassion? No! Never! If we can save a little from the extravagance of the Spring Festival and use it to help them, it may bring them a lot of comfort! The Qingxia Lonely, Widowed, Poor, and Sick Relief Fund, hosted by this column, is the best opportunity for us to give alms. Dear readers, please hurry up and donate!

### Wen Lanting's Condition Improves – Intestinal Cancer to Be Surgically Removed

[Report from This Newspaper] Wen Lanting, who is being treated at the Red Cross Hospital on Haige Road, has improved slightly after several days of careful injections and treatment at the hospital, but his condition is still not out of danger. The hospital used X-rays on New Year's Eve and performed surgery on the same day to remove his intestinal pain. It is planned that after a dozen days of rest and recovery, a second operation will be performed. Wen's fever was 39 degrees Celsius yesterday, and his breathing was still rapid. With the hospital's permission, his family members are attending to him in the hospital.

### Greetings and Prosperity: Pedicab Drivers Quote Exorbitant Prices, Cars Are Chartered by Number

A spring rain, drizzling softly, somewhat diminished the festive atmosphere of the New Year!

Looking back at the past year, despite economic instability, most industries managed to weather the storm, which some considered a stroke of great fortune.

Although the issue of year-end bonuses caused quite a stir, some industries brought joy to everyone and were seen with "new eyes." It is said that the director of Factory XX alone received a bonus of 120 million, and even ordinary technicians received over ten million. The China Textile Corporation was not too bad either, with all employees receiving an additional four months' salary. In addition, several paint companies made a substantial profit last year, so each employee's bonus was at least 30 million. This inevitably caused some "stimulation" among others in the industry.

It's the New Year, and everyone is indulging in the tradition of clasping their hands and bowing to each other, exclaiming, "Greetings and prosperity!"

On "New Year's Day," a tram ticket inspector met a conductor and, as usual, said, "Prosperity! Prosperity!"

The conductor seemed humorous, replying: "Making a fortune is not about selling tickets, or else I'd have to skim from the top!"

Visiting relatives is a major event during the Spring Festival, and car services did good business. With more people than cars, everyone lined up by number, and many only got a ride in the afternoon after registering in the morning.

Pedicabs also saw this opportunity and quoted exorbitant prices. They argued that it's a "new world for the New Year," and people don't care about the cost. It seems the drivers had an easy time making money, asking for tens of thousands at every turn. If our estimates are not too high, the average daily income of a pedicab driver should be at least 300,000.

Theaters also did brisk business, packed to the point of being "impenetrable." To cater to the general audience's tastes, film companies brought out "fair legs" and "jade arms" to attract attention. As a result, movies like "Splendid Paradise," "Jade Hall of Wealth," "Golden Horse Jade Hall," and "Nightly Spring Festival"... all appeared to meet the season. Everywhere showed a scene of "singing and dancing in peace"!

Here: There was also a good business in scalped tickets, with a single "flying ticket" selling for 8,000.

At least it can be said that "New Year's Day" was generally peaceful. The District Court only received one case from the police station on "New Year's Day," perhaps because everyone was busy celebrating the New Year?

As the New Year begins, all things are renewed. We will say few discouraging words, as "the past is gone!" The whole year's plan lies in the spring. May everyone welcome a good God of Wealth tonight and have a year of "universal peace"!

Finally: We greet this "Year of the Pig" with great excitement, hoping that pork prices can lead all industries and that all prices will trend downward! Then our country and our people will be fortunate! May pork prices lead all industries and that all prices will trend downward! Then our country and our people will be fortunate! Fortunate!

Pig! We hope you lead all industry prices on a downward path

### Central Bank's Selling Pressure: Gold Prices Repeatedly Rise and Fall; Stocks and Currency Eager to Rise; Rumor of Large Shipment of Gold Arriving

Gold prices were extremely chaotic during the holiday break. On January 21 (Lunar New Year's Eve), the fluctuations were the greatest, initially ranging from 4.13 million to 4.15 million, but then the Central Bank stepped in to suppress it, gradually lowering the price. After 10 a.m., the Central Bank allocated 580 bars at a price of 3.299 million, breaking the 4 million mark. Subsequently, in addition to open allocation, the Central Bank vigorously sold at market prices such as 4.01 million, 4 million, and 3.96 million, with extremely smooth sales and eager buyers. Therefore, although the price briefly fell to around 3.94 million, it still rebounded above 4 million by noon. In the afternoon, after the Central Bank's control measures ceased, sales remained strong, and soon the price exceeded 4.1 million. There were still transactions after 5 p.m., with market prices already shouted up to over 4.2 million, and there was a transaction at 4.3 million in the evening. On January 23, except for dealers of allocated gold, most companies did not open for business, with the off-market price initially quoted at 4.25 million to 4.3 million. After 10 a.m., the Central Bank allocated 500 bars at a price of 3.93 million, and the final quoted price was reduced to 4.05 million. The two major central banks openly and secretly sold over 10,000 bars. The black market exchange rate for US dollars was between 6,800 and 7,100, and the Hong Kong dollar stood at around 1,400 yuan.

On January 23, Chinese stocks opened on a positive note, with all stocks opening higher. However, as the Central Bank allocated gold at lower prices, sentiment softened and prices retreated. Nevertheless, small-cap stocks showed promise, and as a result, compared to before the market closed for the holiday, Wing On Silk, King Fook, Chun Hing, and Wah Fung all rose slightly, while Mayer fell by half a percent, and Sincere and Sun Kwong suffered slight losses. Cold stocks all saw slight increases. In forward trading, Wing On Silk, Sun Kwong, and Sincere slightly decreased, while Chun Hing and Wah Fung slightly increased, and Mayer fell back by half a percent.

On January 24, a small number of gold shops resumed operations yesterday, making market prices and transactions more active than the previous day. The market opened at 4.03 million to 4.06 million, but buyers were wary due to allocation concerns and retreated to within 4 million. After 10 a.m., the Central Bank allocated another 1,470 bars at a price of 3.93 million, at which point the price briefly fell to 3.95 million. Subsequently, selling pressure eased, buyers were also eager, and the price rebounded above 4 million. At noon, the price rose to 4.1 million, and the silver shops of gold industry members increased the price of decorative gold from 420,000 to 424,000.

Yesterday was the second day of trading for Chinese stocks after the New Year, and trading volume remained low. After 11 a.m., trading became even quieter. The market opened lower, as the Central Bank reduced prices for allocation and rumors circulated of a large shipment of gold arriving, causing fear. Sellers continued to be eager after the opening, and suppliers of forward Wing On Silk from numbers 224, 110, 31, and 158 lowered the price to 785 yuan. Number 35 bought spot Wing On Silk on the dips, and numbers 198 and 231 also entered the market, but because number 89 and others were still selling, they struggled slightly. However, off-market prices continued to rise, and gold prices also rebounded. Numbers 156, 169, 180, and 223 all entered the market. Near noon, forward Wing On Silk rebounded to 807 yuan before leveling off. The noon closing showed the same price for forward trading. As a result, compared to the previous closing, Wing On Silk, Sun Kwong, and Chun Hing slightly increased, Mayer and Wah Fung slightly decreased, and King Fook remained the same. In forward trading, Wing On Silk and Sincere slightly decreased, Mayer, Chun Hing, and Wah Fung slightly increased, and Sun Kwong remained the same. Trading in cold stocks was sparse and slightly decreased.

### Production Loans: Over 60 Billion Loaned Out; Inspection Team Established to Strengthen Audits

The Provisional Review Committee for Production Loans of the Joint Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (J.R.R.A.) has been working in Shanghai for over a month. With the assistance of government and national financial institution officials, as well as financial, industrial, and commercial leaders, and mining experts, the committee has provided appropriate funding to all types of enterprises that are continuing production and urgently need low-interest loan assistance, while commercial enterprises such as transportation and sales have not been handled. Production enterprises have already been loaned to over 300 households, with a loan amount of over 60 billion yuan. This government measure has provided considerable assistance to industry, mining, and general business operations, and the production sector in Shanghai has benefited greatly. Furthermore, in order to ensure that manufacturers who have already received loans can effectively use the loaned funds to increase production, the office has established an inspection team to strengthen audits, in order to fulfill the government's original intention of organizing this production loan.

### China Textile Corporation to Resume Yarn Sales on Monday

[Our Correspondent] Although the China Textile Construction Company resumed operations yesterday due to the Lunar New Year, it did not open for yarn sales as usual. It has now been decided to resume yarn sales next Monday.

In addition, the first batch of 150 tons of Shaanxi cotton ordered by the company arrived in Shanghai yesterday. It is reported that a total of 1,500 tons will arrive in Shanghai. The price of each dan (unit of weight) of cotton delivered to Shanghai is legally 150,000 to 160,000 yuan, which can be used to spin approximately 42-count cotton yarn.

### Textile Control Committee to Hold Regular Meeting

[Our Correspondent] The 21st regular meeting of the Textile Control Committee was originally scheduled to be held this Thursday. Due to the Lunar New Year holiday, it has now been postponed to 10 a.m. today at the City Hall conference room, where discussions on the procurement of yarn and cloth will continue. It is reported that the six district cotton spinning associations have not yet filled out and submitted the notification forms for the first batch of yarn and cloth to be procured by the government. Therefore, after today's meeting, measures will be taken to expedite the progress of the work.

### Import Management Committee Intensifies Review and Issuance of Permits

No Holiday for New Year

[Our Correspondent] Because of the heavy workload, the various departments of the Executive Committee of the Provisional Import Management Committee did not take a holiday during the Lunar New Year, and at the same time intensified the review and issuance of permits. It is reported that among the permits already issued, gasoline and fuel oil accounted for the most, followed by urgently needed materials such as sleepers, to meet urgent needs.

### Tea Mortgage Loans: Farmers Bank Loans Out 120 Billion Yuan; China Trust Bureau's Purchase Price Not Yet Determined

The tea mortgage loans organized by the Farmers Bank of China were originally divided into two types: self-funded and tea processing loans, with each type of mortgage loan quota set at 60 billion, totaling 120 billion. Currently, the entire amount of these mortgage loans has been loaned out, and tea from the self-made processing portion is still being delivered continuously. In order to support the tea industry, the bank has decided to continue handling the loans, and the mortgage loan quota may be 30 billion, which is currently being discussed with the Central Bank for re-pledging procedures. The tea mortgage loans handled by the bank this time were initially limited to four areas: Tunxi, Pingshui, Wenzhou, and Qimen, and then three areas in Hubei and Hunan, Ningzhou, and Fuzhou were added. Therefore, after repeated increases in the mortgage loan quota, it was still insufficient. There is no problem with the China Trust Bureau purchasing the above-mentioned mortgage tea, but the purchase price and tea grades still need to be discussed by all relevant parties before a final decision can be made.

### First Shipment of Japanese Raw Silk Can Arrive in England Within Two Weeks: 35 Shillings Per Pound

[Reuter, London, 23rd] The Ministry of Trade announced today: The first shipment of Japanese silk to England since the Pearl Harbor incident will arrive within two weeks and will be sold to manufacturers at a price of 35 to 36 shillings per pound.

This shipment totals 160,000 pounds and is the first shipment of the 1,000,000 pounds of silk ordered from Japan this year.

According to a spokesperson: Most of this Japanese silk will be used by hosiery manufacturers, and one-third of the products will be exported abroad. The spokesperson also said: The United Kingdom has a treaty with the Allied Supreme Headquarters that the United Kingdom should receive 6% of the raw silk exported by Japan, but this provision will gradually expire, as private transactions have gradually resumed, but orders must go through the government, as privately run commercial firms cannot directly transact with the Japanese.

### Production Equipment for Industry and Mining: Taiwan Province Coordinates Purchases

In order to strengthen production capacity and improve people's lives, the Provincial Government has decided to make a comprehensive plan to enrich the production equipment of public mining factories and enterprises. It is reported that the relevant departments have separately notified all mining factories and companies to fill out detailed reports in the short term in order to coordinate the handling of the purchase of the above-mentioned equipment.

### Japanese Raw Silk Sales Are Sluggish; Cotton Goods Are More Optimistic: Observations of the US Army Authorities

[Reuters, Washington, 23rd] The US Army authorities are paying close attention to the export of Japanese silk and cotton goods. It is investigated that Japan's main imported goods are funded by these exported goods. Before the war, the United States bought seven-eighths of all silk goods exported by Japan, of which 90% were used to make silk stockings. However, officials believe that the popularity of nylon stockings (commonly known as glass stockings) will greatly reduce the sales of Japanese silk in the United States. Currently, Japan has 150,000 bales of raw silk available for export, and produces about 125,000 bales of raw silk annually. If all of this raw silk can be sold, it can reduce the cost of the occupying forces. However, the sales of Japanese raw silk are currently sluggish, with only 20,000 bales being sold, worth US$25 million. Therefore, the US military authorities are very concerned about the future of Japanese raw silk. However, they are more optimistic about Japanese cotton goods. Japan has obtained surplus raw cotton from the United States worth 150 million yuan, which is exchanged for Japanese cotton goods exports. According to the US military authorities currently responsible for Japan, this approach has four benefits: (1) It allows the Japanese to obtain employment; (2) It enables Japan to obtain the funds needed for major imports through exports; (3) It enables Japan to manufacture the cotton goods that the Far East urgently needs; (4) It enables Japan to make good use of the US government's surplus raw cotton.

### Ministry of Economic Affairs Plans to Strengthen Operations: Handle Overseas Commercial Information Reporting

The administrative operations under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Economic Affairs will be strengthened and promoted, including factory registration, mining rights establishment, electrical business registration, and company registration, which will be actively launched simultaneously. It is reported that the following plan has been formulated: (1) Amend necessary laws and regulations, such as changing the original factory registration rules to factory registration regulations and establishing a factory permit system; (2) Add necessary institutions, such as restoring the supervision of exchanges in various places and adding overseas commercial attachés; (3) Strengthen administrative supervision, such as allowing provincial authorities to handle mining rights registration matters; (4) Strengthen close work linkages, such as contacting the Ministry of Finance to crack down on loans to factories not registered with the Ministry of Economic Affairs, consulting with the Ministry of Finance to strengthen the supervision of exchanges, contacting embassies and consulates abroad to handle overseas commercial information reporting work, and contacting chambers of commerce and trade associations in various places to handle factory registration and domestic market commercial information surveys, etc., which are being planned and implemented.

### Restoration of Commercial Banks and Financial Institutions: Explanation of Handling Process by the Currency Department

Recently, your newspaper's editorial on the 11th of this month, "The Focus of Economic Issues," was deeply felt and highly admired. The responsible authorities have long paid attention to or are seeking and resolving the points raised. However, in the first paragraph (1) of the article, "The issue of the restoration of commercial banks and financial institutions," it stated: "The application deadline was extended to July 15, 1946, and there was no approval for further extension, but in fact, applications for resumption of business can still be accepted to this day." This is not consistent with the facts. After investigation, the deadline for commercial banks and financial institutions to apply for resumption of business was extended to July 15, 1946. The Ministry of Finance will absolutely not accept applications submitted after July 15. For those mailed in various places before July 15 and received by the Ministry of Finance after July 15, those with a postmark date confirmed to be before July 15 will be accepted, and the envelope will still be attached to the file for verification. The handling is extremely strict and cautious, and there is absolutely no fact of "still being accepted to this day." As for the continued processing of applications for the restoration of financial institutions (1) that were submitted to the Ministry before July 15 and require additional documents or investigation of documents; (2) financial institutions in the pacification areas that were unable to apply before July 15 due to factual limitations were specially stipulated by the Ministry to complete the application procedures within two months from the date of recovery. Therefore, the deadline of July 15 should be regarded as an exception in the pacification areas. The case files are all available and can be reviewed. In addition, among the various documents, those that require proof from the local city or county government and documents closely related to local finance are due to the fact that these financial institutions were not registered with the Ministry of Finance before the war, and there are no records to check. If they are not certified by the city and county governments, the Ministry of Finance will have no knowledge of the relationship between these financial institutions and the local area. This was the original intention of the legislation at the time and should be understood by the world. In short, the restoration of commercial banks and financial institutions is a heavy task in the post-war financial restoration. The Ministry of Finance has repeatedly heard about the disputes arising from this and has paid great attention to and investigated them, and has discovered cases of forging documents and impersonating names to swindle, which have been sent to the court for investigation. If the responsible officials have demanded bribes, it is hoped that the public will report the facts, and the Ministry of Finance will punish them to the full extent of the law in order to purify officialdom and emphasize law and discipline. However, since the number of applications for the restoration of business reached more than 1,500, and not all of them could be approved, those who hold grudges are naturally numerous, and rumors are inevitable in this filthy society. This requires fair public opinion to make a choice and not make public officials who abide by the law too heartbroken.

### Opinions on the Newly Revised Central Bank Law

— Wang Xiaolai

Article 2 of the Central Bank Law promulgated by the National Government on May 23rd, the 24th year of the Republic of China, stipulates four special privileges of the Central Bank: 1. Issuing convertible notes for standard currency and subsidiary currency; 2. Managing the government's standard currency; 3. Managing the national treasury; 4. Underwriting domestic and foreign debts.

During the Anti-Japanese War, the Central Bank successively grasped the nationwide bill exchange, unified the issuance of legal tender, and managed foreign exchange and gold trading, which indeed had a tendency to become the "bank of banks."

Due to the evolution of this trend, it is heard that the Legislative Yuan has proposed the following eight special privileges for the Central Bank in the legislative principles of the Central Bank Law: 1. Issuing banknotes; 2. Acting as agent for the national treasury; 3. Managing public debts; 4. Buying and selling bullion; 5. Stabilizing international balance of payments; 6. Receiving designated portions of banks' legal reserve deposits; 7. Handling bill rediscounting; 8. Handling bill clearing.

These new legislative principles, judging from the development path of central banks in various countries over the past fifty years, and based on the evolution of our country's central bank over the past ten years, are still considered to meet the needs.

Since the Central Bank's business will be expanded so much in the future, and its powers will be increased so greatly, its relationship with national and public livelihood is no longer comparable to the past, especially its close relationship with commerce, industry, and the banking industry, where even a slight disturbance can have a significant impact.

Because the Central Bank has such a close relationship with the industrial and commercial circles, the central bank laws of some countries explicitly stipulate that members of the Executive Committee or Directors should be filled by people from the agricultural, industrial, commercial, and banking industries. For example, Article 54 of the Belgian National Bank Law promulgated in 1927 stipulates that three of the nine members of the Executive Committee (i.e., Directors) are selected from candidates nominated by industrial and commercial associations, agricultural associations, and trade unions. The qualifications for the remaining Executive Committee members are prominent figures in the commercial, industrial, and banking sectors. Similarly, Article 33 of the Chilean Central Bank Law of 1925 stipulates that among the ten Directors, in addition to seven elected by shareholders, the remaining three are each selected by the National Chamber of Commerce, the National Agricultural Association, and the General Labour Union. Furthermore, according to Article 25 of the Estonian Bank Law of 1927, the election of Directors is nominated by commercial, industrial, agricultural, cooperative, and labour groups and submitted to the general assembly for election. The situation is similar in Britain and France.

Why are some of the Directors or Supervisors of the Central Bank nominated by economic organizations? The scholar Ke Xu (Kiech), who studied the central bank system of various countries, put it very well. He said: "The interrelationship between a country's economic organization and commercial conditions is extremely complex, and every move of the central bank is enough to have a significant impact on it. Taking the discount rate as an example, even a slight increase or decrease has different effects on industries and businesses, and the situations vary greatly. If the government completely controls the central bank, it will not only easily cause political problems, but also easily cause economic disputes. Therefore, the central bank should have a national perspective on "policy" and should not be completely controlled by officials on "control." Even if the capital belongs to the state, it should still be independent in administration."

Mr. Ke's words are indeed insightful. In the future, in order to manage and operate the Central Bank of our country properly, and in order to coordinate policies with the national economic situation, people from commerce, industry, agriculture, banking, and insurance industries should participate in the duties of Directors and Supervisors, so that it will forever become the "bank of banks" on the one hand, and truly become the "bank of the people of the whole country" on the other hand.

As for the method of economic organizations participating in the duties of Directors and Supervisors, from the perspective of legislative technique: either each economic organization can nominate several people by itself, or, according to the provisions of the old Central Bank Law, "the central government shall select a number of people from those who are actually engaged in commerce, industry, agriculture, and banking."

It is heard that the newly revised Central Bank Law stipulates that the source of capital is entirely borne by the national treasury, becoming state-owned and state-operated. If this becomes a reality in the future, it will not affect the opinions I have provided above. Because the capital provided by the national treasury is also borne by the people, and since it is borne by the people, representatives of various economic organizations should be given the opportunity to participate.

Based on the expansion of the Central Bank's powers in our country over the past ten years, as well as the established examples of the organization of central banks in various countries, I have briefly stated my opinions as above to express my heartfelt expectations.

### Jiaotong University Faces Financial Difficulties, Professors Owed Three Months' Salary, Student Union Cables Chief Zhu to Appeal

[Reported by this newspaper] The student union of National Jiaotong University recently sent a telegram to Minister Zhu Jiahua of the Ministry of Education, stating: "We have heard that education is a major plan for the country for a hundred years and the driving force for national construction. Therefore, Chairman Chiang repeatedly encouraged the people of the country with 'Education First.' However, to this day, Jiaotong University is facing an unreasonable contraction of funds, which is about to lead to a standstill. All students in the school are extremely heartbroken! Jiaotong University has a glorious history of fifty years, and the people of the country all cherish it. Although it has gone through many hardships, it has been able to thrive and grow and become a driving force for national construction. Looking back, although the country's finances were extremely difficult during the war, Jiaotong University was still able to maintain itself. Now, it is facing this unprecedented hardship at the beginning of peaceful national construction. Who will the Minister ask to be responsible for destroying education? We have heard that some professors at our school have been owed salaries for three months. The school has had to use high-interest loans to pay them, and the professors have to bear 50,000 yuan of interest per month. It is infuriating to say! Furthermore, the number of staff members is too small, and administrative efficiency is slow. Every semester, classes have to be delayed for two months before they can begin. Infinite time is wasted. Who will the Minister ask to be responsible for delaying the studies of three thousand students? In contrast, Peking University and Central University have three thousand students and more than one thousand faculty and staff members, and five thousand students and one thousand three hundred faculty and staff members, respectively. Now, Jiaotong University has more than three thousand two hundred students, but only four hundred faculty and staff members. Compared with them, we do not know what scale the Ministry of Education uses to calculate? Why are we treated so generously to them and so poorly to us? We cannot understand! The entire student body of our school is in a state of anger. We, as young people, will not be able to suppress our anger. If there is no satisfactory solution, the entire Jiaotong University will be in a state of turmoil and will continue to express itself. We hope that the Minister will consider it! We respectfully send this telegram and wish you peace."

### Measures for Hiring Foreign Professors, Ministry of Education Now Working on Formulation

It is heard that these measures will soon be issued by the Ministry of Education for all schools to comply with.

"Since education in Shanghai began in the late Qing Dynasty, private schools have been established since the founding of the Republic of China, which has become a trend. Over the past thirty years, those who have made contributions to the country and those who have graduated from private schools have numbered more than ten times those from public schools. Private schools do have an urgent need for society, and the spirit of those who run private schools has never been absent. During the Shanghai War, education in Shanghai was severely suppressed. Public schools, due to the dangerous environment, closed down. Our colleagues in private schools supported the precarious situation in the midst of storms, corrected the thinking of young people, and cultivated awareness of resistance against Japan. Those who were unfortunately taken advantage of by the enemy and puppet regimes, fell into the water and fire, were humiliated, attacked, wounded, and murdered cannot be counted. Those who toiled day and night, ate simple food and drank plain water, felt cold in winter and hungry in times of plenty, still maintained their spirits and persevered in their original intentions are even more numerous. This is a common understanding of society. Therefore, a loan was initiated to express sympathy to the education sector. This situation is still vivid, and our colleagues in private schools will always be grateful and never forget it. Now that the country has been rebuilt and the sun has shone again, everyone is celebrating. Unexpectedly, over the past year, the cost of living has risen sharply, and our private schools have been operating under difficult conditions without getting a little rest. Instead of encouraging improvement in education, knowledgeable people have criticized the school fee income. Newspapers have reported on this repeatedly, causing a stir in society. Some even call us 'school shops' and accuse us of 'collecting money.' Our colleagues in private schools are at peace with our consciences and can only endure humiliation, bear insults, and quietly wait for the correct public opinion of society. The participants of the meeting have failed to understand the difficulties of running schools, have not considered the rising prices, and have not remembered the difficulty of struggling through the precarious situation of the past. Swayed by newspaper reports, they have imposed regulations on the fees charged by our private schools, making it impossible for education to develop due to financial difficulties, which is a worrying situation. Considering the feelings and reasoning, how could this be the original intention of the participants? Our colleagues were planning to actively rectify during this recovery period, carefully select teachers, enrich equipment, put young people on the right track, and make great achievements in the future. We cannot help but express our regret for this major misunderstanding. We also remember Chairman Chiang's words on 'Education First,' and we should continue to work hard and never slacken in order to live up to expectations. In order to maintain our integrity and protect education, we should not hesitate to make sacrifices and strive for it. We cannot remain silent about the rumours in the newspapers. As for the school fee regulations of the meeting, whether or not we should abide by them legally and whether the amount is appropriate for us will be decided by the general assembly. This is a special declaration."

### Far East U.S. Navy Basketball Tournament – Shanghai Team Wins Championship – Defeats Tianjin Team in Yesterday's Final

The Far East U.S. Navy Basketball Championship, hosted by the Shanghai U.S. Navy District, commenced on the 17th of this month. Naval teams from Shanghai, Japan, Okinawa, Tianjin, Qingdao, and other locations participated in a five-day competition held at the city stadium. Ultimately, the Shanghai team emerged as the overall champion and will soon travel to Guam, Pearl Harbor, Great Lakes, Chicago, and other places to compete in the All-American U.S. Navy Basketball Championship. Details of each game are as follows:

Shanghai Defeats Okinawa: Starting from the 22nd, coinciding with the Lunar New Year holiday, newspapers were suspended, and the stadium was not bustling. At 2 PM, two matches took place. In the first match, the Shanghai team faced the Okinawa team. Okinawa took an early lead, reaching 14-5. However, Shanghai gradually found its rhythm, tying the score at 17-17. Then, the Shanghai team broke away, leading 22-20. Okinawa, not willing to concede, fought back and regained momentum. At the end of the first half, Shanghai trailed 28-33. After switching sides, the Shanghai team unleashed its power, aggressively closing the gap, causing Okinawa to falter. Ultimately, Shanghai won with a score of 60-57.

Tianjin Eliminates Japan: In the second match on Sunday, Tianjin played against Japan. After the initial engagement, the Japanese team took a lead of 15-11. The Tianjin team identified the opponent's weaknesses and changed its strategy, employing long-range shots with a high success rate, making nine out of ten attempts. By the end of the first half, Japan trailed 27-35. After the break, with the teams switching sides, Tianjin continued to lead due to its well-rounded players. The Japanese team tried to salvage the situation but ultimately lacked coordination. When the final buzzer sounded, they were eliminated by Tianjin with a score of 59-68.

Tianjin Further Defeats Qingdao: On the 23rd (second day of the Lunar New Year), at 3 PM, Qingdao competed against Tianjin. The audience was still small. Tianjin scored first, while Qingdao relied solely on free throws for points. Tianjin continued its efforts, accumulating points. At the end of the first half, Qingdao had 10 points, while Tianjin had 27 points. After switching sides, the two teams clashed again. Although the Qingdao team tried to rally, Tianjin's tight defense left no openings. Qingdao's defense was weak, and Tianjin was exceptionally rampant. In the end, Tianjin defeated Qingdao with a score of 62-31, securing the right to the final.

Shanghai Defeats Tianjin: On the 24th (yesterday), at 3 PM, the Shanghai team faced the Tianjin team in the final match for the Far East Championship. The match was held at the city stadium with a larger audience. Before the match, many predicted that Tianjin would win the championship, believing that Shanghai would inevitably lose. However, after the start, the Shanghai team played steadily and smoothly, while the Tianjin team appeared flustered and committed numerous fouls. At the end of the first half, the Shanghai team led 26-14. After switching sides, the Tianjin team briefly rallied, but soon the Shanghai team was able to do as it pleased. When the regulation time ended, the Shanghai team defeated the Tianjin team with a score of 47-41, and will soon fly to Guam for the expedition.

### The Author of the "Double Gradual Su Qing Zhugongdiao"

— Ye Dejun

Among the "Zhugongdiao" of the Song, Jin, and Yuan dynasties that have survived to the present, there are three types: one is the "Liu Zhiyuan Zhugongdiao," which contains the "Shang" and "Jiao" tunes that were no longer used in the teaching studios. This was likely created earlier and appears to be a work of the Song Dynasty. The second is the "Romance of the Western Chamber Zhugongdiao," written by Dong Jieyuan of the Jin Dynasty. The third is the "Anecdotes of Tianbao Zhugongdiao," written by Wang Bocheng of the Yuan Dynasty (with newly compiled editions). In addition, in the "Romance of the Western Chamber Zhugongdiao" and Yuan Shi Junbao's "Zhugongdiao" "Wind, Moon, Purple Clouds Court," which narrates the singing of Zhugongdiao, there are some Zhugongdiao titles, of which "Double Gradual Su Qing Zhugongdiao" is one.

The story of the scholar Double Gradual and the courtesan Su Xiaoqing already existed in three or four types of Southern Drama and Yuan Zaju during the Song and Yuan dynasties. Dozens of sets of Yuan Dynasty Sanqu also narrate or involve it, making it a common allusion. The original story appears in Volume 7 of Mei Dingzuo's "Qingni Lotus Record" of the Ming Dynasty. Chapter 51 of the 120-chapter version of "Water Margin" recounts Bai Xiuying's performance of "Double Pursuit of Su Qing in Yuzhang City" at the hooker's place, which was a performance of this "Double Gradual Su Qing Zhugongdiao." Although this Zhugongdiao has been lost and no longer exists, the author can still be researched, but commentators have not touched upon it. Yuan Xia Bohe's "Collection of Green Houses" says:

"Zhao Zhenzhen and Yang Yu'e are good at singing Zhugongdiao. Yang Lizhai saw them singing Zhang Wuniu's and Shang Zhengshu's compiled 'Double Gradual Small Township'..."

According to the "Collection of Green Houses," it is indeed based on something. Yang Chaoying's "Taiping Yuefu" Volume 9, Yang Lizhai's "Partridge Sky" poems and "Shao Bian" San Tao also record this matter. First, there is Yang Chaoying's small preface, saying:

"Zhang Wuniu and Shang Zhengshu compiled 'Double Gradual Small Qing.' Zhao Zhenzhen is good at singing. Lizhai saw Yang Yu'e singing his songs, so he made 'Partridge Sky' and 'Shao Bian' to praise it." According to the lower half of the "Partridge Sky" poem:

"Crying jade flute, sobbing ice strings. After Wuniu's death, there is no more transmission. The old pen of the lyricist and the beautiful mouth of the singer, re-summon the spring breeze to the eyes." The last three songs of the "Shao Bian" suite say.

"[Second Kill] Who quietly remembers him? Who coldly asks about him? There are still people who see the saddle and think of the horse. Zhang Wuniu's creation is like selecting jade from stone, Shang Zhengshu's recomposition is like adding flowers to brocade. Shatter that pearl ring, the four heads are lively, the branches and knots are skilled and smooth.

"[One Kill] I learn to sing, you learn to speak, who dares to compete with the predecessors. Zhao Zhenzhen first occupied the top of the list, Yang Yu'e temporarily filled the second house. Spreading the Dharma for the Buddha, flute knocks on the moon, board sprinkles red teeth.

"[Tail] Must not teach a sentence to be wrong, a half character to be different. Sing a book of multi-sadness, multi-thought, and multi-love words, teach you to listen to a romantic prodigal son." (Hanfenlou's photo-printed Yuan edition contains the second half of this suite, and the Ming Wanli movable type edition collects the complete suite.)

According to the above records, "Double Gradual Su Qing Zhugongdiao" was compiled by Zhang Wuniu and Shang Zhengshu. The "Collection of Green Houses" clearly states that it is Zhugongdiao, but the small preface of "Taiping Yuefu" does not specify it. However, according to the "Shao Bian" suite "I learn to sing, you learn to speak," it is clearly Zhugongdiao, because it is precisely about both speaking and singing.

The "creator" of this Zhugongdiao, Zhang Wuniu, was the person who first created "Zuan Ci" in the early Southern Song Dynasty. Nai Deweng's "Ducheng Jishang," Wu Zimou's "Menglianglu" Volume 20, and Wu Zeng's "Nenggaizhai Manlu" Volume 1 all have the same records. "Menglianglu" says.

"During the Shaoxing years, Zhang Wuniu Datian, after hearing the Taiping Ling or Zuan Guban in the moving drum board (that is, the current Bai Ban's large section's inflection point), then wrote a complaint."

Zhang created "Zuan Ci" during the Shaoxing period, and the Zhugongdiao seems to have also been made at this time, only eighty or ninety years away from Ze Zhou Kong Santuan, who first created Zhugongdiao during the Xining and Yuan祐 periods (1068-1093).

The re-compiler, Shang Zhengshu, named Dao, was a Yuan Dynasty person and an official scholar (see Zhong Sicheng's "Record of Ghosts and Gods" "Predecessors Who Have Died"). Yuan Haowen called him: "Humorous and chivalrous, with the style of the ancients." In addition to Zhugongdiao, he also made Sanqu. The fifth volume of "Yangchun Baixue Qianji" collects four branches of Tianjingsha Xiaoling, and the sixth volume of "Taiping Yuefu" has a set of Yue Zhao Ting. "Yuefu Xinsheng" Volume Shang records Xinshui Ling, Yi Zhi Yi (two sets), Liangzhou Seventh, Yexingchuan, and Feng Ru Song. "Feng Ru Song" also has another set: a total of four Xiaoling branches, eight suite sets. His words belong to Qingli. Yinning Xianwang Zhu Dian's "Taihe Zhengyinpu": Zhengshu's words "Shang is like the scattered steps of the morning glow."

### Poetry Talk

Human language never ceases; poetry never ceases.

Human sound never ceases; poetry never ceases.

Human dreams and hopes never cease; poetry never ceases.

Humans can never separate themselves from language, sound, dreams, hope, and poetry and exist independently...

When humanity suffers persecution or life carries more burdens, humans never forget language, sound, dreams, and poetry...

The worried are the best at dreaming...

The lonely cherish sound even more because of its scarcity...

Laborers have their primitive songs...

The exiled have learned to howl mournfully...

### Two Chapters of Cloud Flags

— Hu Mu

Clouds

Clouds, flashing in the blue sky of dusk, white clouds, ochre clouds, sky blue clouds, vermilion clouds... On sunny days, I love to go out with my walking stick, so beautiful clouds fill my beloved little bridge, flowing water, village, green fields...

I love clouds. Therefore, I live in a valley with many clouds and fog. In this quiet valley, I forget spring and autumn.

But, I always remember that outside the clouds, there is still my hometown with white clouds flying and streams gurgling, oh: on that dear, warm earth, there are family members waiting for me to return, there are wildflowers and flocks of cattle and sheep waiting for me to return...

Clouds, I want to sail on your silver-white sails, taking eternal laughter, to sail outside the mountains.

Clouds, you are like ginseng floating in my heart.

Just as the poet Shelley sang for the west wind, I write poems saying, "Beautiful clouds rise into the blue sky."

Clouds, I live firmly every day for you. I write the chapters of human suffering for you every day...

Clouds, white clouds are our flag, a white flag of peace waving....

Fiery red clouds are the blue blood we shed, sky blue clouds are the beautiful dreams we pursue...

I love the flowing in the jade blue sea of ​​heaven, so my breath has the smell of the sea, I recall those days by the sea, there are my love and hate, there are traces of my childhood with childhood sweethearts.

I want to be in love with the clouds, until the people in the villages and fields have all lit up their lights.

Clouds, waving, I look forward to, until the night steals up from the mountains on all sides.

Flag

I am in love with the flag.

The flag, fluttering, leaping, waving.

I love our flag, when the flag is waving in front of the team, so our will is pursuing the flag, the flag is directing us to advance, advance...

On the boundless field, under the call of the flag, we form a solid team, like an unbreakable chain, for the happiness and freedom of China, we set off with a smile to march...

Flag, quickly tie the flag.

Where there is a flag, there are our dear people and comrades.

Because, I dearly love the flag. So, under the vast flag, I continue to walk, to the place full of laughter, tears, sound and light...

With a flag of will, we have a truly bright path.

With a flag of justice and freedom, we can gain happiness and freedom.

The flag is waving, leaping, waving in our youth ranks.

### Poems from Dream Outside the Building

— Xu Chengyu

Listening to Qin and Singing

A husband's ambition is to dominate the four seas, but he gathers the four seas into one heart. He burns incense, sweeps the floor, and sits with his eyes closed, suddenly hearing the rustling of pine trees. Writing the meaning in my chest, because of your qin music. One string on your fingers turns and turns, in the Wuxia Gorges, the clear autumn is late in the day. The roaring of the mysterious ape on the ridge is low at first, and the sound of the lonely crane in the clouds is gradually distant. The flying spring of a solid stream has endless thoughts, and the clear commercial music of the green water is melodious and fluent. Spring birds and autumn leaves are outside the soul, and the remaining sound floats in dreams. Moving emotions three thousand miles across the sea, peeking at the moon twelve times by the building. At this time, the river moon and river water are clear and boundless. The water moon shines brightly, rippling with secluded feelings, and the hills and valleys all appear on the strings and fingers. The sad sound changes tune and suddenly becomes sad and poignant, breaking the heart over the mountains and passes, in the rain, wind, and snow. Jing Ke's Song of parting at the Yi River, Su Wu and Li Ling parting at the river bridge. Looking up at the floating clouds at the beginning of the Tai, the universe has existed for ten thousand years. What is the value of fame and fortune in the world? Let's not let the qin and wine be lonely.

### Pearl Shells

— Jiang Dun

Like shells, like pearls, like stars, whether on the beach, in the sea, or in the sky, we all have our own brilliance!

On the silver sandy beach, there are as many shells as stars in the sky. Every shell is left with the waves of the sea. You who pick up shells barefoot, besides leaving countless footprints on the beach, you have already gained the wisdom of the sea—accommodating everything and giving everything brilliance!

Adventurous pearl divers go to the bottom of the sea to find the round pearls—the fruit of the mother shellfish's lifelong hard work. In order to add a little beauty to the world, pearl divers entrust their lives to the sea, and countless pearl divers have disappeared on the seashore. Thus, more pearls are accumulated in the world—like stars in the sky! Pearls are formed because of the mother shellfish's disaster, and countless painful results accumulate our wisdom and happiness!

On the beach, looking up at the brilliant starry sky, every star is an ideal, an eternal symbol! Shell pickers, pearl divers, star lovers, all who love brilliance and pursue brilliance, your discoveries will all be in accidental insights and constant painful efforts.

Picking up shells, harvesting pearls, people reverently lower their heads under the starry sky, people always yearn for more distant and eternal things. Therefore, people themselves have brilliance, like the stars in the sky...

### Madame Recamier

— Girard

Girard was also a major member of the Neoclassical movement, especially specializing in portrait painting. He can not only depict the character of the subject but also fully express the spirit of the era.

Madame Recamier was originally a star in the social circle at that time. When David was painting her portrait first, Girard was unwilling to be outdone and also made this portrait for her. The picture is larger than the one painted by David, but he used skilled and agile skills to complete it earlier. As a result, Girard became famous overnight and became the darling of the society at that time. The original is in the Petit Palais in Paris. (Lion)

### Lonely Night

— Yang Lida

Loneliness lingers between your fingers,

Loneliness lingers by my side.

Loneliness lingers in the evening breeze,

Loneliness lingers under the starlight.

Loneliness lingers in quiet corners.

Loneliness lingers in the vast night.

- After listening to Ma Sicong playing Tchaikovsky's Andante Cantabile.

### An Inch of Land, an Inch of Blood 157

— Ye Jingfeng

"What exactly happened last night? Tell the truth, what kind of tricks is that old fox playing lately?"

"He almost figured out your plan. If it weren't for Aoki-sensei's intervention, putting on a similar operation to fool him, it would have been very dangerous!... But it doesn't affect you personally; he just wants to see what you are doing, so he only set up intelligence posts and didn't attack your operations. This is his style—'leniency'—knowing that you can't do anything in the first place. Their defense is tight, and their intelligence is keen, beyond your expectations. Do you know who else was there yesterday?"

"I have no idea..." Tsurumi let her say more to understand everything.

"The third person of the Black Dragon Society, the extremely powerful 'Hashimoto Toranosuke', arranged everything last night. He's going to be deployed soon, so Aoki-sensei ordered me to help you..." Pingzi couldn't help but smile. She seemed to know that Tsurumi disliked her very much, so she herself found it funny to say the word "help."

"What's the meaning of 'leniency'?"

"He wants you to sincerely and happily work for him."

"What if some of the things I do don't fit into his plan?"

"It's difficult... that 'bitch' is participating in the Orchid Group, she may report everything about you. Besides her, there are many others!"

"You are one of them, right!" It was Tsurumi's turn to laugh.

"As you wish, but I will always protect you!..."

"Do you think we can work together to find a way to get the 'Secret Seal'?" Immediately changed the subject.

"Please rest assured; Aoki-sensei said that our goal can definitely be achieved, just when I decide to return to my country... Alas, but I am also 'making clothes for others'—even if it succeeds in the future, it doesn't necessarily mean any benefits will be on my body!"

"Who is that 'Sister Chunzi'? I thought she was a man!"

"She is the direct descendant of Aoki-sensei's kendo system 'Hirano' master; do you think she is powerful? She also has two kinds of weapons, the flying rope knife and the willow-leaf sword, that she hasn't used yet... She is now a third-level monk, indifferent to worldly affairs." Pingzi showed a miserable smile.

"I am very grateful to Elder Aoki for his care; but there are still some things I don't understand..." Tsurumi said hesitantly.

"It's probably not that you don't understand, but that you are not at ease!... Let me tell you, he already knows eight or nine out of ten things about you. The old man once said, 'We have the same goals but different paths'! However, we seem to be cooperating sincerely!"

Tsurumi and Pingzi were communicating with hand signals. The woman opposite them seemed to be somewhat aware, but she just sneered slightly, pretending not to hear or ask, and looked out the window. At this time, the plane had been flying for a long time, piercing the clouds and the sky, aiming at that vast and uncontested broken land, roaring and advancing rapidly. How many times has it flown across the sea like this, I don't know how many more times there will be in the future, and I don't know how much trouble it will bring, how many bones and flesh will be broken apart on that land, how many lives will be sacrificed, how many tears of sorrow will be shed by those poor children! (End of Chapter 6)

### Sloppy Year

— Ruosi

There is a saying: "Clean Winter Solstice, sloppy year."

I don't know if it's because the Winter Solstice of a cloudy year didn't rain; the weather at the Lunar New Year is always strange. The wind and rain are truly desolate. Many people who "squeeze" through the New Year's pass and welcome the New Year are squeezed through with mud and water, frowning, looking embarrassed and miserable.

But after all, the New Year's pass has been squeezed through. Those who have fallen have fallen, and those who have not fallen? Naturally, they are still standing there. Those with strong backs, needless to say, are still standing tall; those with insufficient strength have undoubtedly been squeezed and their original energy has been greatly hurt. But after reviewing: although the year is sloppy, it has become the past. Learning from the past can guide the future. Looking at the future, is there a need to make new changes? Or repeat the old tune and prepare to squeeze through another sloppy year?

Looking at the weather, it is indeed a bit ominous. After a sloppy end of the year, a sloppy beginning of the year follows. Recently, it doesn't seem like there are any signs of clearing the clouds and seeing the blue sky.

At the end of the Lunar year, I paid attention to "weather forecasts" every day, and there were "improving" signs every day, but it didn't "improve" every day. It dragged on day after day, and as a result, it dragged on into a "sloppy year", and it still affects the new year, which is really not pleasant.

Looking at the peace talks over the past year, talking and fighting, fighting and talking, when Marshall first came to China, he flew all over the country, spreading seeds of peace. The Chinese people couldn't help but feel that the mediator had worked hard, but everyone hoped that the soldiers would "rest," so they all welcomed friends of peace. Unexpectedly, running around was just running around, and talking and fighting continued until the end of the Lunar year. Marshall flew back to the United States, and the military mediation department was in a state of terminal illness. Although the soldiers did not "rest", Marshall's running around in China was about to "rest". Finally, it dragged on until the Lunar New Year, and Yan'an rejected the peace envoy Zhang Zhizhong. The peace news suddenly turned rigid, and it also squeezed through a "sloppy year". It was very disappointing.

At the beginning of the New Year, the weather is certainly not very clear, and I hope that the political weather will not be the same. I hope it can become clear in a decent way. As long as the political weather is clear, even those friends who have been squeezed down and injured by the New Year's pass, resulting in frowns, embarrassment and misery, will also become clear. Because the Chinese people have deeply understood the taste of "sloppy" after experiencing this "sloppy year".

It is really so-called:

"Eating cold water in cold weather, every drop is in the heart."

### The Lovable Common People

— Suo Bei

Reflections on the Passing of the Lunar New Year

Before the Lunar New Year, there was a chorus of complaints about "not being able to get through the year." Unexpectedly, once the New Year arrived, there was a flurry of congratulatory greetings, and everyone was happy. The difficult year had, after all, passed, passing by in a muddle!

These past few days, firecrackers have filled the air, drums are everywhere, and everyone has forgotten all their sorrows. This is originally the muddle-headedness of the Chinese people, but it is precisely this that is the Chinese people's strength. They can endure pain, forget pain, and transform pain into joy, replacing despondency with hope! There is no need to criticize this "rare muddle-headedness." Without it, the War of Resistance could not have been sustained for eight years!

After getting through another year, one cannot help but praise the lovableness of the Chinese common people! They are good at accepting suffering and good at seeking hope!

Every household, no matter how poor, will paste cheerful Spring Festival couplets with smiling faces when the New Year arrives. Even more commendable is their ability to place their hopes on their descendants. This is why China is different from India.

Reality is so harsh, yet the common people still work hard and bear hardships without complaint, filled with enthusiasm. The scene of the Lunar New Year is truly moving! I must repeat: the common people are lovable! (But what should be emphasized here is the phrase "common people.")

### Those Pardoned and Released from Prison Talk About the Flavor of Iron Bars

— Li Sheng

My friend, Mr. He, was imprisoned due to litigation. He had already fully experienced the flavor of iron bars for five months when he was pardoned and released before the Lunar New Year's Eve. Knowing that we had reunited, it felt like lifetimes had passed. In addition to joy, we had a delightful conversation about the circumstances in prison, which were bizarre and peculiar. I have specially selected and recorded them below. What follows are his own words:

First Entering Prison

When I first entered prison, I didn't understand any of the rules. They locked me in a small room. It is said that new inmates must first be locked in a solitary cell; it is like baptism before entering the church. The old inmates here call the new inmates' entry into the solitary cell the euphemistic name "Solitary Gate." Besides new inmates, old inmates who do not follow prison rules or fight with each other are also thrown into "Solitary Gate." Therefore, "Solitary Gate" is the worst treatment for inmates.

The Battle of "Solitary Gate": After I was locked in "Solitary Gate," an old inmate responsible for errands came in. This kind of inmate who is responsible for errands is called "Mao Putou" (Hooligan).

After Mao Putou came in, he asked me for money, demanding 300,000 yuan at the start! At that moment, I was filled with righteous indignation and slammed the door with force, hitting Mao Putou on the head. Not paying attention, he ate my blow, and fell to the ground. I then grabbed a toilet lid (because there were no other weapons) and hit him on the head, followed by a punch to the chest. Mao Putou immediately fainted. I became frightened, but the fellow inmates all cheered and said: "Good! A college student has guts!" At this time, the person in charge asked me why I committed violence in prison, and I said that he was trying to extort money from me.

Being Shackled:

They said that I had violated prison rules and put a sixteen-jin shackle on my feet as punishment. I generously allowed them to shackle me. But then, I "couldn't walk, brother!" Later, some well-meaning old inmates said, "You are naive. You got shackled but didn't even ask for a piece of shackle cloth. How can you walk?" Then, someone saw me as a hero and volunteered to ask for a piece of shackle cloth for me. They wrapped the chain around my waist with the shackle cloth and had to learn to walk with "shackled steps."

I Appealed: The four words "shackled and imprisoned" I had seen in novels, but now I personally experienced it. They said they would shackle me for a month, but I couldn't bear it after one day! The next day, I made a "report" saying that Mao Putou wanted to extort money from me, and I became violent in anger. If you say I violated the rules, then is Mao Putou's fraud acceptable? This "report" was approved, and they removed my shackles. Removing the shackles was even more painful than putting them on – extremely painful – but it is cheaper to be literate when facing lawsuits.

Making Friends with Fellow Inmates:

I was a minor offender and was only sentenced to six months of imprisonment. Later, the judge added another six months because I had received higher education, making it a year. Serving a year of imprisonment, I was despised and called a "rice thief" by the old inmates! When I first entered prison, I injured Mao Putou, so the old inmates also treated me with respect. As time went on, I got to know many fellow inmates, including robbers who killed and stole, talented and knowledgeable political prisoners, and petty thieves who stole chickens and dogs.

Well-Informed:

Many people think that prisoners are not very well informed about outside news, but this is not the case. As time went on, I was also able to go outside (within the prison grounds), or sometimes I was transferred to a different cell. Each cell held four inmates. Therefore, I knew more about the true stories of each person's crime than the judge, such as the cases of Liang Dai'an and other criminals, and the Guo Ying case, all of which I saw personally. Guo Ying even gave me a towel with perfume on it, but Guo Ying's handwriting was terrible, like that of a third or fourth-grade elementary school student. He was also very old, about forty years old.

Strange Prison Stories:

The cooking room was managed by female inmates. Among the female inmates was Zhou, whom everyone in prison called "Thirteen Cuts." "Thirteen Cuts" had a face the color of gray paper and walked barefoot, carrying water inside. Sometimes, when she heard people call her "Thirteen Cuts," she would yell: "You floating corpse! I'll cut you thirteen times!" - There was also the main character who conspired with the boss to murder her husband; her face was also very ugly. It's really strange! Yu Xiangdun doesn't receive much support in prison anymore. Now, only a group of scholars from the university help him. Yuan Ludeng pastes matchbox covers in prison to relieve boredom...

Finding Joy in Suffering:

Although there are many workshops and libraries in prison, sometimes it is still unavoidable to be bored. There was a Russian in prison who taught me Russian. I would forget it after he taught it, and I wasn't interested. But he still wanted to promote his political views to me. - In the midst of boredom, we also came up with ways to entertain ourselves. The female prison was one floor below us. We dug a small hole in the floor (old inmates call digging a hole "opening a peach garden") and used an iron wire to hang food down, but we required them to sing or dance as payment. We would watch and listen at the "peach garden" opening.

Among the female inmates, there were many young singers and dancers, and some could sing Peking opera well. As long as we threw cigarettes down, they would dance and sing, but how could they have music? With no other option, we could only hit the "toilet lid" to create rhythm. The dancers and singers below performed well and with vigor, and our pounding on the toilet lid caused the toilet to leak!

Corrupt Officials and Traitors Crying:

When I "escaped" (was released), I took many clothes and bedding out of prison. Many traitors and corrupt officials inside cried together. I had been with my fellow inmates for a long time, and feelings inevitably arose, so I also shed tears.

"You are not a hero if you haven't been here, and you're not worth half a penny if you come again" is the couplet in prison.

### Jiang Dingwen, Who Recently Went Abroad

— Sun Dianwei

General Jiang Dingwen took the General Meigs ship to the United States on the third of this month. Before leaving, Jiang told reporters on the ship: "This trip abroad is purely for personal sightseeing and has no other tasks. I plan to stay in the United States for half a year and then go to other parts of Europe. I expect to return home in a year, at which time I will pay more attention to social construction and local administrative points in various places."

General Jiang Dingwen was a famous general during the Northern Expedition. His loyalty and courage during the Xi'an Incident won him a lot of praise. Anyone who thinks of this brave general who once dominated the battlefield will respectfully salute. Who knew that he was an exceptionally approachable person, tall, with a thick face. Although he is not often seen smiling, he speaks with great gentleness. His loud voice reflects his uprightness, and his sincere demeanor reveals his loyalty.

General Jiang Dingwen, courtesy name Mingsan, is from Moshi Mountain, Zhuji. His family was very poor when he was young. At the age of nine, he entered Tuanshan Elementary School. After graduating, he couldn't afford to continue his studies, so he resolutely joined the army. At that time, Jiang was only eighteen years old, but his decisive spirit surpassed others. Whenever there was a battle, Jiang would bravely charge forward. During the campaign against ×, Jiang was seriously injured and lay stiff on the battlefield for more than ten hours before being rescued. But Jiang never showed any signs of sorrow and did not shed a single tear, truly having the demeanor of Lord Hanshou Ting when he cut his arm to extract an arrow.

Amidst his busy military life, Jiang continued to diligently pursue academic exploration. At the Huangpu Military Academy, Jiang once said to the then-President Jiang: "I am not afraid of death. If you want me to charge into battle, I will absolutely obey; but when there is no need to die, I still hope to study." After the success of the Northern Expedition, Jiang asked Chairman Jiang to recommend him to the Army University or to study abroad. But at that time, the Chairman Jiang relied heavily on Jiang and did not want him to leave his side, so he did not agree to his request. In a speech to the Zhuji expatriates, Jiang once said: "I can say that my life has been bright and upright, without shame when looking up or down. My disadvantage is that I read fewer books in my childhood, which made me an 'unlearned' person. Therefore, whenever I encounter something, I often feel inadequate to deal with it. This is truly the greatest regret of my life!" From this passage, we can see what a humble person Jiang is!

This time, Jiang finally obtained a special permission from the Chairman and took a ship to the United States on the third. His long-cherished wish for decades has finally been fulfilled today, which can also fill the void in his heart.
