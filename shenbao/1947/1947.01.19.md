### Yan'an Rejects Peace Envoys; Government to Issue Statement Today; Government Reorganization Proceeds as Planned

Chairman to Host Banquet for Three Parties' Representatives Tonight

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 18th] Chairman Chiang is scheduled to host a banquet on the evening of the 19th for government and Political Consultative Conference representatives such as Sun Ke and Zhang Qun, as well as important figures from the Democratic Socialist Party and the Youth Party in Nanjing.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 18th] The Communist Party has responded to the government's proposal to send representatives to Yan'an for negotiations, with a telegram arriving in Nanjing. At 10:30 AM on the 18th, Wang Bingnan visited the Special Envoy to verbally convey this reply, which roughly stated: "The CCP still insists on dissolving the National Assembly and restoring the military situation of January 13th as the basis for peace talks. If the government cannot accept these two points, then the government need not send representatives to Yan'an. If it is possible to accept them, then the CCP can immediately send representatives to Nanjing to conduct negotiations with the government." Wang finished speaking and then left. It is reported that the Special Envoy did not express any opinion at the time. At 5:30 PM, the Special Envoy responded to Chairman Chiang's telegram and went to the official residence, immediately relaying the two opinions Wang reported. He returned to the American Embassy at 6:30 PM.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 18th] Regarding Yan'an's rejection of peace talks, the government will issue an important statement on the 19th. It is understood that the content will be roughly as follows: (1) Review of the peace talks over the past year. (2) Publication of the four-point new plan for restoring peace talks.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 18th] It is reported that the new peace plan contains only four principles: (1) The method of peace talks will be for the government to send representatives to Yan'an or for the Communist Party to send representatives to Nanjing. The format will be a round table conference or other methods. (2) Immediate ceasefire. (3) Troop reorganization and restoration of transportation will be carried out according to previous agreements. (4) The issue of local government will be resolved through consultation between the two sides.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 18th] The issue of government reorganization is still proceeding simultaneously with the peace talks. There are many opinions from various parties. Although it was not raised for discussion at the Sun residence meeting today, Sun told reporters after the meeting that although the peace talks have been turbulent due to the Communist Party's rejection, it will not affect the reorganization of the government.

### Democratic Socialist Party and Youth Party Express: CCP Should Not Impose Conditions

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 18th] Sun Ke, Chen Lifu, Shao Lizi, Zhang Lisheng, Wang Shijie, Zhang Qun, Wu Dingchang, Zhang Zhizhong, Lei Zhen, and Democratic Socialist Party members Zhang Junmai, Wu Lianzi, Jiang Juntian, Wan Renqian, Xu Chuanlin, and Youth Party members Zeng Qi, Zuo Shunsheng, and others, sixteen in total, held a meeting at Sun Ke's residence at 5:00 PM on the 18th to exchange opinions on the current situation. Because the Communist Party had already rejected the government's sending representatives to Yan'an, they immediately discussed the next steps. People from the Democratic Socialist Party and the Youth Party spoke successively, believing that the government has expressed its hope for the resumption of peace talks, and the CCP should not impose any preconditions, which is tantamount to closing the door to peace. Government representatives also expressed their agreement, believing that the government sincerely hopes that peace talks will resume. If the CCP insists on the two conditions, making it impossible for the government to consider them, then the resumption of the war will be caused by the CCP. The meeting adjourned at 9:45 PM. Premier Sun replied to reporters' inquiries, saying: The government will have an important statement on the CCP's reply in the coming days, and another meeting will be held on the 19th to exchange opinions and report to the Chairman. Lei Zhen also said: When the government expresses its attitude on this matter, the content of the new peace plan may be announced at the same time.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 18th] The new peace plan proposed by the government was further discussed at the Sun residence meeting on the 18th. In addition to the opinions exchanged between Lei Zhen and various parties in Shanghai, the plan was discussed carefully again today, with slight revisions.

### Statement by CCP Official

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 18th] According to the New China News Agency broadcast from Yan'an on the 17th, a responsible person of the CCP Central Committee, in response to inquiries from the New China News Agency reporters, completely refused to discuss peace matters, and arbitrarily insulted Chairman Chiang and Special Envoy Marshall.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 18th] According to a New China News Agency dispatch from Yan'an on the 17th, a reporter from the New China News Agency interviewed a responsible person of the CCP Central Committee on the 17th, asking if Chiang Kai-shek would send representatives to Yan'an and what his purpose was. The responsible person of the CCP Central Committee replied: "On the morning of the 16th, Chiang Kai-shek, through Stuart, informed Wang Bingnan, the Communist Party spokesman in Nanjing, that he was sending Zhang Zhizhong to Yan'an to discuss peace, but this is completely a deceptive tactic. Chiang Kai-shek has ignored the two minimum demands proposed by the Communist Party, 'canceling the false constitution and restoring the military position of January 13th last year,' which proves that the so-called 'peace talks' are completely deceptive. Chiang Kai-shek's attempt is to occupy 165 cities and 179,000 square kilometers of land in the liberated areas, but after being defeated and having 53 brigades annihilated by the People's Liberation Army, he seeks a respite to consolidate the occupied areas, replenish the army, and re-attack. For this purpose, he now needs 'peace talks.' If the ceasefire agreement personally signed by Marshall and Chiang Kai-shek's representative Zhang Qun in January last year could be torn up cleanly by Chiang Kai-shek, and Marshall presided over unilateral aid to Chiang and launched a civil war, then what way is there to prove that it is not a deception when an American introduces a person named Zhang to open so-called 'peace talks'? Zhang Zhizhong himself also represented Jiang Jieshi in signing the Northeast Ceasefire Agreement on March 27th last year, but it was torn up by Chiang Kai-shek only five days later, and a major war broke out in the Northeast. What way is there to prove that anything negotiated this time will not be torn up by Chiang Kai-shek in a few days? If the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference presided over by Chiang Kai-shek in January last year could be torn up cleanly by Chiang Kai-shek, daring to convene an illegal 'National Assembly' and create a false constitution to guarantee dictatorship, what way is there to prove that the current so-called 'peace talks' have a shred of sincerity? Because of all this, we have completely lost trust in the currently clamored so-called 'peace talks.' Unless Chiang Kai-shek cancels the false constitution and restores the military position of January 13th last year, there is no way to prove that he is not deceiving. Therefore, to start negotiations, these two conditions must be met. The Communist Party and the people of the whole country are no longer willing to be deceived."

### Zhang Shenfu on Peace Talks

CCP Should Not Impose Conditions at This Time

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 18th] Civil League representative Zhang Shenfu was originally scheduled to fly to Peiping on the 18th, but was canceled due to bad weather. After the CCP's reply was announced, reporters asked Zhang for his opinion. Zhang said: The CCP should not impose conditions at this time, and the United States should discuss them together. As for these two points, the government should agree in principle, but the implementation should be discussed together. Zhang expressed that the reorganization of the government should (1) have determination, (2) emphasize the spirit of democracy, and (3) demand national progress. Militarily, a neutral zone can be established, with a third party maintaining security. Regarding various issues of peace talks, Zhang expressed his willingness to continue to engage with government officials.

[Central News Agency, this city dispatch] Civil League member Zhang Bojun told reporters yesterday that whether the Civil League will participate in the peace talks depends on whether the opinions of the KMT and CCP can be close. If the opinions of the KMT and CCP are still divergent, even if the Civil League participates, it will be of no benefit. He believes that whether peace talks can resume depends on the sincerity of both the KMT and CCP, and denies that Zhang Shenfu's trip to Beijing is carrying a mission. In addition, Zhang Dongsun's trip to Beijing these days is also to handle private affairs.

### Democratic Socialist Party Representatives Arrive in Beijing; Zhang Junmai Will Provide Opinions on Peace Talks; Zhang Qun and Lei Zhen Jointly Pay Respects to the Chairman

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 18th] Lei Zhen, accompanied by Democratic Socialist Party members Zhang Junmai, Ren Hufulin, Wu Lianzi, Jiang Renqian, Sun Baoyi, Jiang Yuntian, and others, arrived in Beijing on the morning of the 18th. After Lei got off the train, he and Zhang Jun immediately paid respects to the Chairman at around 9:00 AM, reporting on the business negotiations in Shanghai, and informing him that people from the Democratic Socialist Party and the Youth Party had been invited to Beijing to jointly participate in consultations on the resumption of peace talks and government reorganization. After Lei excused himself, he immediately called Sun Ke's residence to report everything.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 18th] All the Democratic Socialist Party members in Beijing held a meeting at Zhang Junmai's residence at 12:00 AM on the 18th to discuss opinions on the new peace plan proposed by the government. Zhang Junmai and others were invited to Beijing by the Chairman, and Zhang will pay respects to the Chairman in the coming days to provide opinions.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 18th] Representatives of various parties staying in Shanghai are successively going to Beijing to promote the resumption of peace talks. Zhang Junmai and his party of eight from the Democratic Socialist Party arrived in Beijing on the morning of the 18th. They came here with great hope for the resumption of peace talks, but it is not known that the CCP has already publicly rejected the government's sending Zhang Zhizhong to Yan'an for negotiations. Yang Jun told reporters: When they took the train from Shanghai to Beijing on the morning of the 18th, they had not yet heard this news. Because he had not read the content of the CCP telegram, he did not want to criticize it, but said: He hopes that this trip can jointly promote the resumption of peace talks with all parties.

[Our Dispatch] Reliable sources say: Zhang Junmai's trip to Beijing this time is entirely the result of the sincere invitation of the highest authorities. It is heard that Zhang expressed to friends before going to Beijing that he hoped to return to Shanghai before the lunar New Year. In addition, people within the Democratic Socialist Party hope that when the peace talks officially resume in the future, Zhang can regularly represent and attend, and do not advocate that others replace him, so that his speech can accurately represent the position of the Democratic Socialist Party.

[Our Dispatch] Hu Haimen and Liang Qiushui, representatives of the Democratic Socialist Party in the North, were originally scheduled to fly to Peiping yesterday, but due to delays in ticketing, they changed it to today. When Yan Zhen left Shanghai this time, he strongly invited Zhang to go to Beijing with him, but the two did not go because party affairs in the North urgently need to be rectified. It is heard that the activities of the Democratic Socialist Party in the North cover North China and Northeast China. After the victory, they will absorb new members, and training work needs to be developed urgently. In addition, party members in the North have witnessed the people suffering from the ravages of war, so their desire for domestic peace is stronger than ordinary people.

### Marshall to Return to Washington, D.C.; Will Be Sworn in on the Same Day

[Our Dispatch] San Francisco 18th Broadcast, the White House recently announced: General Marshall will return to Washington next Monday morning, and will be sworn in on the same day, and will discuss important national affairs with Truman. Marshall has resigned from his military post, and will serve the country as a civilian official from now on.

[Associated Press, Nanjing, 18th] The future development of the US mediation effort must await the new US policy toward China to be determined after Marshall meets with Truman.

Observers predict that the US policy toward China will be no more than the following three points:

(1) Take a laissez-faire attitude toward the evolution of the situation in China and have no fixed policy.

(2) Stay completely out of the matter.

(3) Assist the Chinese government's policy, but must stop the civil war and immediately reorganize the government to prove that it is sufficient to accept US assistance.

None of these three policies are satisfactory. Judging from Marshall's statement, the United States seems most likely to adopt the third policy.

### Marshall's Residence Refutes Rumors

Rejects Claims that Soviet Ambassador Participated in Mediation

What Was Published in a Certain Newspaper Has Absolutely No Basis

[United Press, Nanjing, 18th] A spokesman for General Marshall's residence announced today that the claim in the Xinmin Daily yesterday that Special Envoy Marshall had rejected Soviet Ambassador to China Petrov's willingness to assist in mediating the conflict between the KMT and the CCP three times is "completely unfounded." The newspaper also said that Zhou Enlai returned to Beijing from Shanghai to resume negotiations because Chairman Chiang's trip to Taiwan was due to Marshall's persuasion in order to leave room for negotiation. This is also inaccurate. In fact, Chairman Chiang's trip to Taiwan was decided more than a month ago. Marshall had persuaded him to stay a little longer, at least to have time to meet with Zhou Enlai in Beijing.

### Ministry of National Defense Convenes Regulations Consolidation Committee

First General Meeting Approves Agenda

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 18th] The Ministry of National Defense convened the inaugural meeting of the Regulations Consolidation Committee at 3:00 PM on the 18th, presided over by Deputy Minister Lin Wei and Division Chief Liu Xiaoyuan. The participating units included the Naval Headquarters, Army Headquarters, Air Force Headquarters, Joint Logistics Headquarters, Military Personnel Division, Civilian Personnel Division, First Bureau, Fourth Bureau, Military Court, Comforting Troops Headquarters, Security Bureau, Civil Affairs Bureau, and Historical Materials Bureau. It is reported that today's meeting passed the general meeting agenda.

### Various Election Laws and Regulations

Wang Chonghui and Wu Shangying are Studying Them

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 18th] Various election laws and regulations related to the Constitution are being preliminarily studied by Wang Chonghui and Legislative Yuan Secretary-General Wu Shangying. Once there is a decision in principle, the Legislative Yuan's special committee can conduct further research.

### Xikang Petition Delegation Demands the Replacement of Liu Wenhui

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 18th] The Xikang people in Beijing petition delegation, due to the increasingly serious conflict between the military and civilians in the province, went to the National Government again on the 18th to petition. Director Xu Jingzhi received them and promised to forward the delegation's two requests to the highest authorities: to replace Liu Wenhui and his troops. The delegation then went to the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of National Defense, and other agencies to petition, and hosted reporters at noon to report the facts.

### Receiving Dalian Issue

Rumor Has It that the Soviet Union Made Two Demands to Us

[French News Agency, Nanjing, 18th] According to sources close to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the representatives of the Chinese and Soviet governments are not currently conducting negotiations on the Chinese Changchun Railway, but the Changchun Railway issue is very different from the receipt of Dalian, the latter of which does not require negotiations. At the same time, it is reported that the Soviet government recently made the following two demands to the Chinese government regarding the Dalian issue: (1) The Chinese government should recognize that the Soviet Union can obtain enemy and puppet property, that is, what was received when the Soviet army entered Northeast China. (2) The management rights of the Chinese Changchun Railway, which was controlled by Japan during the occupation, should be handed over to the Soviet Union.

### Supung Dam on Yalu River; Soviets Agree to Let Us Take Over Defense; Ownership of Supung Power Plant is Being Negotiated with South Korea

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 18th] The Soviet side agreed that our army will formally take over the dam on the Yalu River within our country's borders at the Supung Hydroelectric Power Plant on the 20th. Negotiations on the ownership of the Supung Power Plant are also being conducted directly by the Northeast Electric Power Bureau of the Resources Committee with the South Korean side. It is heard that negotiations have reached a concrete stage. According to the agreement signed between Korea and the Puppet Manchukuo in 1937, the ownership and related benefits of the hydroelectric power plant should be equally divided between the two parties. The power plant originally had seven generators, each capable of generating 100,000 kilowatts, for a total of 700,000 kilowatts. After Japan surrendered, some were dismantled or destroyed, and now there are only three generators left, which can generate 300,000 kilowatts. According to the principle that the assets of the Puppet Manchukuo should belong to our country, our country should have half of the power plant's ownership and power generation. According to existing calculations, the electricity to be transmitted to our country for application should be 150,000 kilowatts. However, although South Korea's electricity is extremely abundant, its northern authorities only provide other 3,000 kilowatts to our Andong for use. These 2,000 kilowatts must be exchanged for food, cloth, and other materials. Under the current situation where the vigorous promotion of industrial production in Northeast China requires electricity very urgently, if this negotiation can achieve a reasonable solution, it will make a great contribution to the revitalization of industry in Northeast China.

### Accompanying Her Father to Confront [Her Assailant] in Court: Ms. Shen Chong Sheds Tears, Uttering "That's Him!" Startling the Principal Offender

[Central News Agency, Peiping, 18th] The U.S. Marine Corps First Division military tribunal publicly tried the case of the atrocities committed by [U.S. Marine] Piertson at the Tungtan Drill Ground in this city. The trial resumed at 9:00 a.m. on the 18th, concluding at 12:10 p.m., and continued from 1:30 p.m. to 3:10 p.m. The court personnel included all military judges except for one fewer clerk than yesterday. Observers included Hu Shih, He Siyuan, Zuo Mingche, Meng Zhaoying, Ji Yuan, Li Shitong, Zhao Fengjie, Zhang Shuxian, Lü Baodong, Shen Shao, Yang Zhenqing, and over ten Chinese and foreign reporters. Shen Chong, accompanied by her father, entered the courtroom at 10:10 a.m., wearing a gray coat, with a perm, and a pale complexion, appearing tired. During the two-hour trial, she frequently shed tears. Hu Shih left midway through Shen's testimony, while He Siyuan remained in the audience throughout, paying close attention to the trial proceedings.

Lieutenant Young Reports on Transcripts; Examination of Witnesses Continues

Following the resumption of the court session, Assistant Prosecutor Lieutenant Young first reported on the trial transcripts from the previous day. Witnesses were then successively examined.

(1) Zhang Yingjie (officer from the Police Department's Affairs Section) testified that while on duty on the night of December 24th, he was patrolling in Patrol Car No. 2 when he was stopped by an officer from Patrol Car No. 1 at Tungtan at around 11:00 p.m., who reported that an American soldier had raped Miss Shen Chong. When he got out of the patrol car, it was around 11:30 p.m. At that time, he saw a young woman standing to the right of Car No. 1, with soil on her overcoat, face, and disheveled hair. The American soldier's overcoat was unbuttoned and covered in soil, and he had blood on his lips. He then escorted the American soldier and Miss Shen to the U.S. Marine Corps Military Police Headquarters. The American soldier sat in the front row of the patrol car on the right, while Shen sat in the back row, with an American military policeman and Zhang himself between them. When getting into the car, Piertson tried to help Shen, but she refused. At around 1:00 a.m. (morning of the 25th), when they arrived at the U.S. Marine Corps Military Police Headquarters, Shen's brother-in-law, Mr. Yang, arrived and spoke with them for over ten minutes. He then took Shen to the U.S. Army Military Police Headquarters, and later to the Police Department to report to Section Officer Meng from the Foreign Affairs Section. Afterwards, they went to the Police Hospital, where she was first examined by the attending physician for about fifteen minutes, followed by a detailed examination by Director Wang of the hospital, staying at the hospital for about four hours. After the examination, they returned to the police station, where Section Officer Meng questioned Miss Shen in detail, taking her statement and fingerprints. At 8:00 a.m. on the 25th, she was sent to her brother-in-law's residence.

(2) Corporal Kirkwood (U.S. Marine Corps Military Police Headquarters, serving in the Sino-American Liaison Office), the judge ordered him to identify the defendant. After confirming, he stated: he was the one who took the defendant into custody on the day of the incident.

Ms. Shen Likens Herself to a Mouse Encountering a Cat; Struggling Repeatedly, Exhausting All Her Strength

(3) Shen Chong (the victim), following the prosecutor's instructions, pointed out the defendant, Piertson, after looking around the courtroom twice. She then testified that she had been in Beiping for twenty-four days as of the 24th, staying at her brother-in-law's house. She was unmarried and had never been married before. Her tuition fees in Beiping were provided by her father. Before coming to Beiping, her father gave her 500,000 yuan. After arriving in Beiping, her father wired her 500,000 yuan and 1,000,000 yuan on two separate occasions, all deposited in the bank. She could not speak English, but understood a little. She then described the terrible circumstances of the rape on that day. On the evening of December 24th of last year, she went to see a movie. While walking east from the south entrance of Wangfujing, beside the wooded area on the side of the road opposite the Pingan Cinema, two American soldiers suddenly grabbed her, one holding her left hand and wrapping his arm around her waist, the other holding her right hand and wrapping his arm around her neck. When she shouted "Help!" the American soldier immediately covered her mouth with his hand. The two American soldiers first dragged her to the south wall of South Earth [Park], where they raped her once. At that time, she saw a flashlight beam once. After the rape, the American soldiers dragged her east, still along the south wall, and saw another flashlight beam. This time, they attempted to rape her again, but due to the flashlight search, this rape was unsuccessful. They then dragged her to the empty room in East Earth [Park]. She managed to escape, but was quickly caught by the American soldiers and slipped into a ditch, but did not fall down or kneel. Afterwards, she was dragged by the American soldiers to the northeast of the empty room. It was dark at that time, and she could not see Hatamen Street. She was then raped once more by the American soldiers. Shen testified to this point, then recounted that when she was at the base of the south wall, she discovered her pants had been taken off. Because they were white, she picked them up and waved them for help. "When shouting, the American soldier covered my mouth with his hand." When the American soldiers were raping her at this location (base of the south wall), another American soldier assisted. The scars on her legs were probably caused by the American soldiers at that time, but that American soldier soon left. At that time, she struggled and shouted again. Ms. Shen likened the incident to a mouse being caught by a cat, struggling repeatedly until she exhausted all her strength. She was then dragged by the American soldiers to the empty room in East Earth [Park], truly placing her life beyond consideration. At this time, her neck was choked, and she could no longer shout. Afterwards, when she was being raped again in the empty room in East Earth [Park], two people suddenly ordered the American soldiers to get up with guns. The three of them seemed to be fighting. At this time, more and more people arrived. When the prosecutor further inquired about her situation before coming to Beiping, she testified that she was nineteen years old and had been in Shanghai from 1937 to 1946. During the Japanese occupation, she never socialized with foreign soldiers. After this incident occurred, she had injuries on her body, legs, and lower body.

Subsequently, the defendant's defense attorney cross-examined her. Midway through the cross-examination, the presiding judge, based on Article 282 of the military law, announced that Miss Shen could refuse to answer any questions concerning facts after that day that might harm her reputation or interests. Shen said to the defense attorney regarding his question, "Was the statement given that the first intercourse was consensual and entirely under violence?" She replied, "In a state of panic, I cannot know the beginning." Midway through Shen's testimony, the presiding judge announced that female observers could voluntarily leave the courtroom. Subsequently, she was questioned about various circumstances during the rape in great detail for two hours, until the recess at 12:10 p.m., when Shen returned to her residence.

Doctor Examines Ms. Shen's Injuries; Fresh Tear Found on Hymen

The trial resumed at 1:30 p.m. (1) Wang Hecheng (Director and Attending Physician of the Police Hospital) testified that he was a Doctor of Medicine from Kyoto University in Japan and had been at the hospital for one year and two months. After examining Miss Shen at 2:30 a.m. on the 25th, he learned that she was Shen Chong. The examination result was: there was a fresh tear at the lower part of the hymen in the vagina, with an abrasion of 0.44 cm. Upon examination on January 3rd, he found (1) a laceration of 2-3 cm wide and 1 cm long on the knee joint, forming a scab. (2) In the middle of the left calf, there was a mung bean-sized scab, round on the inside and pointed on the outside. The defendant's defense attorney, based on paragraph 5 of his examination report to the police station on the 25th, which stated "It is difficult to determine whether she was raped," questioned him severely. According to his testimony, the judgment was based on the absence of sperm in the vagina, so it could not be determined. Finally, the prosecutor asked, "Are injuries caused by strong force or violent force the same as consensual injuries?" adding that the explanation of violence included mental threats. Wang testified that the physical abrasions were roughly the same.

(2) Lieutenant Young (Assistant Prosecutor) testified that the weather on the day of the incident was windless, and the roads were dark at night. Today's trial concluded at 3:10 p.m., and the presiding judge announced that the public trial would continue at 9:00 a.m. on the 20th.

Ms. Shen's Testimony Vivid and Detailed; American Soldier's Atrocities Fully Revealed

[Our Newspaper, Peiping, 18th] Shen Chong, 19 years old, pale complexion, blonde hair, wearing a gray squirrel coat, light flesh-colored stockings, red foreign army sock garters, and light green leather shoes. After asking her name and origin, the prosecuting judge asked, "Please point out the defendant." Shen looked from left to right, to the far right, and saw Piertson sitting in the defendant's seat. She immediately pointed him out. After pointing him out twice, the judge asked Shen to come closer and point him out again. Shen went closer and pointed at Piertson, saying, "That's him." Piertson was extremely frightened. The judge then ordered Piertson to stand up to confirm. After confirmation, Shen answered questions. Subsequently, the judge ordered Shen to describe the circumstances of the harm she suffered at that time. Shen described in great detail, fully stating the necessary points, vividly. Many words were those that a young woman would not want to say, but to prove Piertson's atrocities, she revealed everything. Ms. Shen also answered several questions from the judge and the defendant's defense attorney: (1) The American soldier did not give her money. (2) She had never had any contact with any foreigners. (3) The American soldier's several atrocities were all forced. (4) One American soldier ejaculated, and a piece of the back of her coat was wet. His genitals had entered inside. (5) The scars on her knees were caused during the struggle. (6) When she was first seized, she knew the American soldier's behavior was bad, but did not know it was rape. (7) She never consented to the rape, and was always under violence. (8) She did not know if the American soldier was drunk. (9) Her mind was distraught after she was seized.

Hospital Director's Testimony Inappropriate; Beiping Mayor and Others Stamp Feet and Scratch Heads

[Our Newspaper, Peiping, 18th] Wang Hecheng, Director of the Beiping Police Hospital and a Doctor of Medicine from Kyoto Imperial University in Japan, explained during his interrogation this afternoon that he had examined Shen's hymen at around 1:00 a.m. on the 25th and found a new rupture at the lower center, 0.4 cm long. There were no major changes in the uterus, and everything else was normal. Nine days later, he examined her again and found an abrasion three fingers wide on her knee, and a bean-sized blood spot in the center of the lower part of her left leg, round on the outside and pointed on the inside. The rupture of the hymen should be caused by abnormal and forceful intercourse. Shen Chong had told him that she had been raped, but no sperm were found in her vagina, so he could only determine that she had been subjected to forceful insertion, but could not determine that it was rape. Subsequently, the defendant's defense attorney repeatedly questioned whether the injuries caused by three rapes were the same as those caused by ordinary intercourse. Wang seemed to have never understood the meaning of "force," saying that the lacerations caused by force should be larger than ordinary ones, but the prosecuting judge then asked the translator to write out his question to show Wang, asking whether the injuries caused by "force" and "ordinary" could be distinguished. Wang then asked in detail whether "force" referred only to physical force or also to mental force. He then explained that it included the loss of resistance due to force. Wang then said that there was no difference in the injuries caused by the two. The prosecuting judge's raising of this question was opposed by the defendant's defense attorney, but after citing the legal code, the defense attorney was left speechless. The defense attorney had argued, based on Wang Hecheng's explanation of the condition of Shen's hymen, that it could not be determined whether Shen was a virgin before this. The prosecuting judge pointed out that it was beyond the scope [of the question] and objected unsuccessfully. Wang's answers, wording, and medical knowledge were criticized by Mayor He Siyuan of Beiping and other concerned parties in the audience.

[Our Newspaper, Peiping, 18th] The American soldier's rape of Peking University student Shen Chong case continued in public trial on the 18th. Five witnesses were questioned in the morning and afternoon, mainly Shen Chong and the examining physician, Wang Hecheng, Director of the Beiping Police Hospital. Shen Chong's testimony was detailed and orderly, while Wang Hecheng was nervous and serious. The prosecuting judge and the defendant's defense attorney repeatedly cited legal dictionaries during the questioning, and the prosecuting judge was mostly victorious. The audience was the same as yesterday. Because Wang Hecheng's testimony was inappropriate, Mayor He Siyuan of Beiping, Shen's father, and Chinese inspectors Ji Yuan and Shen Chong's two legal advisors in the audience stamped their feet and scratched their heads, restless. Apart from the victim's defense attorney trying his best to find loopholes, the judges' attitude was quite fair. Occasionally, when the translation was inaccurate, they showed the witness a written statement. The Chinese audience was all sweating for this international lawsuit. The 19th is a Sunday, and on the 20th, American doctors and others [will testify].

### Communist Troops Repeatedly Reinforced, Failing Repeatedly; National Army Steadfastly Defends Zaoyang with Blood; Chief of Staff Chen Arrives in Xuzhou to Inspect, Soldiers Inspired

[Our Newspaper, Xuzhou, 18th] After the reserve soldiers of the Communist army in southern Shandong were increased, on the 16th and 17th, they launched a fierce attack on Zaoyang day and night. In western Shandong, to coordinate the Zaoyang operation, they fiercely attacked Yutai on the 16th. The battles have been extremely fierce in recent days. The Communist army has gathered more than 200,000 troops in southern and western Shandong, adopting a large-scale mobile warfare tactic, attempting to avoid strength and strike weakness, conducting fluid operations, and seeking opportunities to attack a single point with several times the superior force, nibbling away at the military strongholds on the periphery of Xuzhou to threaten Xuzhou. However, our military authorities have long been aware of their tricks and have made appropriate arrangements. If the Communist army insists on its own way, it will inevitably reap what it sows.

[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 18th] According to a general who arrived in Zhenjiang from Xuzhou, he told our reporter that the battle situation in southern Shandong and north of Xuzhou has now reached a decisive stage. The National Army will definitely be able to drive back the Communist army during the Spring Festival. Chief of Staff Chen's personal visit to Bian and Xuzhou to inspect and comfort the local military and civilians has greatly inspired the front-line soldiers. Chen arrived in Xuzhou from Zhengzhou at noon on the 17th. He originally planned to return to Nanjing on the same plane, but due to wind and other factors, he stayed in Xuzhou for a short time.

[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 18th] Military news: After the National Army reinforcements to Lincao entered the positions one after another, the situation in Zaoyang has turned from danger to safety. Under the protection of the National Army, the coal mine workers in the area continue to work as usual. Most of the coal stored in the mines has already been transported out. Qicun, near Zaoyang, was rumored yesterday to have been recovered by the National Army.

[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 18th] Military news: The Communist army infiltrated Yongcheng, attempting to break through Xiaoxian Yangshan and re-offend Huangkou, severing the connection between Longhai Bian and Xuzhou.

### Communist Troops Retreat from South Bank of Songhua River; Jilin Battles Near End; Communist Troops South of Qitamu Cleared

[Our Newspaper, Changchun, 18th] The Jilin battles are nearing their end. Only near Huapichang and Jiaowanzi on the Jilin-Changchun line are there still battles. Near Xiaofengman, the Communist army is attempting to destroy the power lines. The people of Yongji are reassured, as the 10th and 11th were the most tense days. Afterwards, the focus shifted to Jiutai Beimushi. There are no battles in the suburbs of Dehui. The troops occupying the railway stations south of the Songhua River have withdrawn beyond the station. The bridgehead north of the Songhua River Railway Bridge is still firmly defended by the National Army. The isolated troops are fighting hard, and the situation is precarious. However, although the Communist army is harassing, the northern bank of the Songhua River is rushing to build defensive fortifications, seemingly retreating. Fulongquan was captured by the Communist army a few days ago. There are no Communist troops near Nong'an. A large number of National Army reinforcements have changed the situation in the battle.

[Our Newspaper, Changchun, 18th] The Communist army on the north bank of the Songhua River has exhausted its strength in its southward movement. The Communist army in the triangle area of Bingji, Dehui, and Changchun has been surrounded by the National Army. The defeat of the Communist army is a foregone conclusion. There is much speculation here about the National Army's actions. It is rumored that two divisions of the National Army have crossed the river from Qianguoqi to outflank the Communist army in Wujia Station, Taolaizhao, and Wukeshu.

[Central News Agency, Jilin, 18th] Military news: The National Army recently began a counterattack against the main force of the Communist army in the Qitamu area.

[Central News Agency, Jilin, 18th] According to a military official here, after the Communist army was defeated in the Battle of Qitamu, the defense of Jilin has become more consolidated.

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 18th] The Fengman Changchun power line was destroyed by the Communist army at around 2:00 a.m. on the 16th and has not yet been repaired. Currently, it relies solely on the small amount of thermal power transmitted from Xi'an and generated by the city's power plant to barely supply a few important military and government agencies and the water plant. Although the general public feels the distress of power and water shortages, the people are extremely calm. Military and police agencies have been particularly diligent in recent days, and security can be guaranteed everywhere.

The total length of the line is 484 kilometers. This is the best and most frequent Chang-Ying direct express train performance after the restoration, which will facilitate it. During the enemy-puppet period, the train was named "Asia" because its maximum speed could reach 120 kilometers per hour, exceeding all railway locomotives in Asia. This train is a new-style streamlined locomotive of the (F8) type, with a locomotive head weighing 199 tons. It was damaged during the Soviet garrison period and has now been repaired by the railway machinery staff here, so it is named "Changchun." It test ran between Changchun and Shenyang earlier this month and went well.

### Guaranteed Postage Restored in Areas with Rail Access; Value-Declared Registered Letters Being Piloted

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 18th] Guaranteed postage was mostly suspended due to the war. Now that the war is over and conditions in various places are gradually returning to normal, the post office has been ordered to first restore domestic guaranteed postage services in areas with rail access, including guaranteed letters, guaranteed boxes, or guaranteed parcels. In addition, the post office is piloting a type of domestic value-declared registered letter, with procedures simpler than guaranteed postage. In areas where transportation is inconvenient and guaranteed postage cannot be sent, or where the value is small and there is no need to send guaranteed postage, it can be sent as a value-declared registered letter for convenience. The maximum value for this value-declared registered letter is temporarily set at 50,000 yuan, with a value declaration fee of 10% in addition to the registered postage. In the event of loss or damage, the post office will compensate according to the provisions of the postal law based on the declared value of the contents, except for losses due to natural disasters, accidents, or other force majeure events. In the future, certificates, deeds, registered or unregistered checks, red tickets, blue tickets (postal money orders not included), and all other important documents and receipts can be sent as domestic guaranteed postage or domestic value-declared registered letters as much as possible.

### If Communist Troops in Northeast Stop Attacking, Changchun Radio Station Will Be Unsealed; Conversation with Person in Charge of Peiping Military Mediation Department

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 18th] A person in charge of the Military Mediation Department made some explanations on the issue of the Communist Party radio station in Changchun being sealed: (1) Five divisions of Communist troops in Northeast China have crossed the Songhua River to invade, personally commanded by Lin Biao, with the aim of capturing Changchun and Jilin. (2) The Military Mediation Department in Changchun did not carry out mediation work a month ago, especially the Communist Party. Its personnel in various groups in the Northeast have also withdrawn, so the Communist Party has in fact abandoned mediation work. Its radio station in Changchun was likely to inform the Communist army during the large-scale offensive, so it was sealed. It will be unsealed as soon as the Communist army stops attacking.

[Our Newspaper, Peiping, 18th] The issue of the existence or abolition of the Military Mediation Department today is confusing. Today, Cai Wenzhi stated that although the Military Triad above the Military Mediation Department is no longer complete and has stalled, the Military Mediation Department still has its basis for existence. From the beginning when the Military Mediation Department was established, it was stipulated that its cancellation must be proposed by Chairman Chiang of the National Government or Chairman Mao of the Communist Party before it could be cancelled. So far, neither of these situations has occurred.

Ye Jianying Lodges Protest

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 18th] Today, Ye Jianying lodged a protest with Government Commissioner Zheng Jiemin and U.S. Commissioner Gillen regarding the closure of the Communist Party radio station in the Changchun branch. He stated that, according to the report of Major General Li Chuli of the Changchun Garrison Headquarters, on the 16th, officers of the Changchun Garrison Headquarters led more than a dozen officers and soldiers with loaded pistols into the Communist Party dormitory, forcibly seizing the radio station and parts and tools. The Communist Party personnel were also monitored. He continued: This kind of action destroys peace talks and strikes at the Executive Headquarters. I hereby lodge a serious protest with Commissioner Zhou and ask you to transfer this to the Changchun authorities to immediately return the radio station and restore work. In addition, I propose that the three commissioners convene a meeting to discuss punishing the perpetrators. Apart from this protest letter, the Communist Party has taken no other action. However, according to a certain Communist Party member, if the reply is not satisfactory, the Communist Party may consider withdrawing.

[United Press, Beiping, 18th] U.S. representative to the Military Mediation Department, Lieutenant General Gillen, today authorized the CCP delegation to continue to use the radio freely, continuing to receive and send telegrams to Changchun in plain code. Gillen had lodged a protest with government representative Zheng Jiemin of the Military Mediation Department, but Zheng has not yet replied. Ye Jianying is now using the actions of the Changchun Executive Headquarters as an excuse, believing that the government intends to abolish the Military Mediation Department, and demanding that the U.S. and government representatives immediately convene a meeting to discuss all issues. Ye also submitted a tough memorandum to the U.S. and government representatives.

### Cai Jinjun Reports to Reporters on the Situation of Governance on Hainan Island, Security is the Most Serious Problem

[Our Newspaper, Guangzhou, 18th] Cai Jinjun, member of the Guangdong Provincial Committee and director of the Qiongyai Office of the Provincial Government, recently met with reporters to report on the situation of governance on Hainan Island. According to him, the most serious problem on Hainan Island at present is security. Recently, the provincial government dispatched six security regiments to be stationed in Qiong to actively suppress bandits. At the same time, it strengthened local grassroots organizations, building 486 blockhouses, with more than a hundred more to be completed soon. It also issued more than two hundred light and heavy machine guns and more than ten thousand rifles to various counties. Nineteen self-defense battalions have now been established, along with two hundred and fifty-seven self-defense teams, and the training of cadres is being intensified, and political mobilization is being implemented. The most effective measure at present is the Bandit Suppression and Village Rescue Committee, where local gentry and elders are enthusiastically working in the countryside. The first phase of the bandit suppression plan has been completed on schedule, and the second phase is starting now. It is expected that the bandits on the island will be cleared in a short period of time. As for construction, Chairman Qian Changzhao of the National Resources Commission flew to Qiong to inspect and plans to develop [resources]. However, the prerequisite, in addition to security, is to ensure smooth transportation and self-sufficiency in food. After the recovery, most of the highways on Qiong Island were damaged. After repeated repairs, the entire line is now passable. At the same time, agricultural water conservancy and cooperative enterprises are being organized to increase rural production. Qiongyai is rich in resources, especially fishing, salt, and sugar industries, which are easy to operate and develop, and are closely related to the national economy. It is hoped that people across the country will actively immigrate and invest. Due to the improvement of security on the island, many overseas Chinese from various parts of Southeast Asia have recently returned. According to statistics for the past few months, remittances from overseas Chinese are about 2 billion yuan, and this month it has increased to 5.1 billion yuan. Cai concluded by saying that Qiong Island is isolated overseas, and the actual situation is often unknown to people in the country. Moreover, after their disastrous defeat, the bandits specialize in spreading rumors to confuse people. For example, it was recently rumored in Nanjing that the price of rice in Qiongyai is 200,000 yuan per *dan*. In fact, the price of rice on the island once rose to 90,000 yuan in September and October due to typhoons and floods, but it has since fallen sharply after price controls were implemented. At present, the highest price of rice on the island is in Haikou, at only about 40,000 yuan per hundred *jin*. As for food planning, the government and local people have made preparations in advance, so there is no cause for concern, he said.

### The Youth League Holds General Verification and Issues a Letter to All Members

[Central Agency, Nanjing, 17th] The Central Executive Committee of the Three People's Principles Youth League has decided to hold a general verification of all members starting on the 15th of this month and will send standing members to various provinces to guide the process, so that it can be properly handled and completed as scheduled. In order to enable all members to understand the significance of the general verification, a letter to all members has been issued, highlighting four main points to arouse the common [effort] of all members. The original text of the entire letter is recorded as follows:

To all comrades of our League:

The purpose of the establishment of our League is to gather new forces for the national revolution in order to achieve success in the War of Resistance and national reconstruction, and to concretely realize the Three People's Principles. During the War of Resistance, all our comrades, under the leadership of the great leader, united sincerely and fought bravely, which was able to inspire the revolutionary youth of the whole country, unify their will, concentrate their strength, and do their utmost for our sacred national War of Resistance in order to win the final victory. Now that more than a year has passed since the victory, the obstacles to peace and unity have not yet been completely eliminated, and the concrete realization of the Three People's Principles requires redoubled efforts. The Second National Congress of our League convened to review the current revolutionary situation and the tasks of the League in the future, and unanimously agreed that consolidating the revolutionary ranks and strengthening the organizational forces are essential for the revolution in the future. Therefore, following the instructions of the leader and with unanimous resolution, the general verification of League members was held. After the establishment of the Second Central Executive Committee, the verification methods were carefully discussed and decided upon, and signed by the leader. Now that the start of the event is required, in order to reveal the significance of it.

(1) Consolidate the Revolutionary Ranks and Strengthen the Forces of the Republic of China

This general verification of League members by our League has two meanings: One is to verify the strength of the League: Over the past ten years, all young people across the country, under the inspiration of the great leader, have enthusiastically joined our League to serve the sacred national War of Resistance. The ranks are very strong and the contributions are great, but due to rapid development, various shortcomings are inevitable, such as inaccurate League membership, unsound grassroots organizations, and the relationship between League members and the League is not strict. As a result, the meetings cannot be fully implemented and the tasks are difficult to complete as scheduled. In order to correct these shortcomings, it is necessary to conduct a general verification of League members, thoroughly clarify League membership, eliminate disloyal and undisciplined elements, and strengthen the tightness of the organization, just like the military. In order for it to be able to accomplish combat missions, attention must be paid to review and verification. Therefore, the purpose of this general verification of League members is to improve its own verification strength, so that it can shoulder the task of revolutionary national reconstruction. The second is to adapt to the requirements of democratic constitutionalism: After the Second National Congress of our League, the country is entering the stage of implementing constitutional government. The National Assembly has now successfully completed the task of constitution-making, and the democratic constitution has also been promulgated by the government. The task of our League in the future is to [ ] with democracy [ ], [ ], the main [ ] political meeting, and participate in the work of building the League. Comrades of our League should know that the essence of democratic constitutionalism is decided by the majority. Therefore, the struggle of the body is more important than the struggle of the individual. If the organization is not sound and the discipline is not strict, then [ ] steps [ ] will be consistent, and strength will have no way to [ ]. Another meaning of the [ ] verification is to gather revolutionary youths under a strong organization, engage in public [ ] competition in a democratic way, actively participate in the [ ] elections of people's representative bodies at all levels, gain the trust of the masses, and then serve the masses, by [ ] the revolutionary propositions of our League, and then develop genuine democracy, [ ] solid constitutional foundation.

(2) Consolidate Revolutionary Leadership and Eliminate Obstacles to National Reconstruction

The fifty years of the National Revolution [are led by] our Party [ ]. The establishment of our League is actually the generation of new forces for the National Revolution. The reactionary forces that are currently undermining the National Revolution are: One is the armed violence groups that hold onto troops and divide up territory, undermining the unity of military and political orders, threatening the great cause of our Party's fifty years of struggle for unity and democracy. The other is corrupt officials, local bullies and evil gentry, as well as comprador merchants, who indulge their insatiable desires, stir up prices, and exploit themselves, creating distance between the people and the government. These two major reactionary forces have made Chinese politics turbulent and backward, and social order chaotic. If these evil phenomena are not completely eliminated, then national reconstruction cannot be promoted. To eliminate the obstacles to national reconstruction, we must first consolidate the revolutionary leadership, thoroughly implement the Principle of Democracy and the Principle of People's Livelihood, so that the success achieved by the Principle of Nationalism has a deeper and more unshakable foundation, in order to implement the ideal of the Three People's Principles revolutionary national reconstruction.

### French Political Situation and Anglo-French Alliance

The French National Assembly and Senate held a joint meeting on the 16th at the Palace of Versailles to elect the President of the French Fourth Republic. Socialist leader Vincent Auriol was elected with an absolute majority of 452 votes. The Blum cabinet, which had the nature of a provisional government, submitted its resignation to President Auriol in accordance with the provisions of the new French Constitution. Auriol accepted it because he had completed his mission successfully and appointed Socialist figure Paul Ramadier as Prime Minister. After Ramadier was ordered to do so, he met with leaders of various parties to begin organizing a new cabinet. He also visited the outgoing Prime Minister Blum and former Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Georges Bidault for discussions, which were particularly valued by all parties. It is expected that the new cabinet will be established soon with the joint support of various parties, which will bring an end to the provisional political system in post-war France. From now on, French politics can embark on the right track of democratic constitutionalism.

The Blum cabinet lasted exactly one month from its formation to its resignation. Although it was a short time, its achievements in this one month exceeded those of any previous cabinet. Domestically, post-war France can be described as a country with many difficulties, especially in the financial and economic aspects, which were riddled with holes, making people's lives extremely difficult. If the government authorities could not make drastic moves and dare to act, it would be impossible to solve the current economic difficulties. However, since Prime Minister Blum formed the cabinet, relying on his past political experience and his political wisdom, he devoted himself to the work of suppressing prices. On the one hand, he ordered merchants across the country to reduce wholesale and retail prices by 5 percent across the board. On the other hand, he dissuaded workers and civil servants from demanding wage and salary increases, so that the lives of every French person could gradually stabilize from now on. Although Blum's implementation of this policy of suppressing prices also encountered many difficulties and obstacles, the results of its implementation were satisfactory, which is a rare achievement in French political history.

Secondly, in diplomacy, Prime Minister Blum personally visited England and met with British Prime Minister Clement Attlee. The two thoroughly exchanged views on the policies that the UK and France should adopt on the German question, and immediately reached a consensus, which gradually brought their different opinions into alignment. Britain's permission to supply France with as much coal as possible from the British-occupied area of the Ruhr region to relieve France's immediate needs can only be said to be a major achievement of Prime Minister Blum in diplomacy. At the same time, this trip also laid a good foundation for the Anglo-French alliance. It is reported that the drafting of the treaty will be held simultaneously in Paris and London and will soon be established, which will also have a great impact on the future development of the European situation.

Blum took up the arduous task last time in response to the love and support of all parties. At the same time, for the sake of the future of the country and the nation, he had to take up the arduous task in this time of crisis and serve the country again. Over the past month, he has made achievements in both domestic and foreign affairs, and can be said to have completed his mission, opening a good starting point for his successor. It is also right to retire successfully and no longer worry about the country; moreover, Blum is old and frail, and he is really incompetent for the important task of the country; therefore, Blum's resignation was originally expected. Now that Ramadier has taken over, there is no problem in forming a cabinet, but his future policies, regardless of their nature, will continue the domestic and foreign policies of the Blum cabinet. On the one hand, he will continue to work hard domestically to suppress domestic prices, so that people's livelihood can be stabilized; on the other hand, in diplomacy, he will conduct talks with Britain to complete the Anglo-French alliance treaty, so that France can truly become a bridge between Britain and the Soviet Union.

As for the rumors of the Anglo-French alliance treaty, as early as the Chinese New Year last year, the international community was full of such rumors. At that time, French Provisional President and Prime Minister Félix Gouin publicly delivered a speech: "France must find a way to establish an Anglo-French alliance as a supplement to the Franco-Soviet alliance treaty. If, because of these two alliance treaties, a tripartite treaty between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union can be further concluded, then that would be the best." Then, the French Socialist Party held a plenary meeting and issued a letter to the French people, which also said, "France should sign a treaty with Britain that is similar in nature to the Franco-Soviet alliance treaty, in order to enhance the political and economic cooperation between the people of Britain and France." From this, it can be seen that the Anglo-French alliance is a consistent policy of the French Socialist Party, and under the leadership of Paul Ramadier, a leading figure in the Socialist Party, the Anglo-French alliance will not be a problem.

The purpose of the Anglo-French alliance treaty is to prevent Germany from invading again, thereby safeguarding peace and security. Strictly speaking, the Anglo-French alliance is enough to enhance peace in Europe; the reason is that after the war, Britain and France had many conflicting opinions on the German question. After this alliance negotiation, it will surely be cleared up, which will be of great benefit to the Four Power Foreign Ministers' Meeting currently being held in London and the Four Power Foreign Ministers' Conference to be held in Moscow in March to discuss the German-Austrian peace. However, on the other hand, we must not be wary of the Soviet Union's misunderstanding. If the Anglo-French alliance is regarded as an anti-Soviet Western European group, then Europe will be divided into two Europes, East and West. From the sudden return of Soviet Ambassador to France Aleksandr Bogomolov to Moscow for consultations, it can be seen that the Soviet Union still cannot avoid some concerns about the Anglo-French alliance. We believe that France must not only eliminate the Soviet Union's misunderstanding of the Anglo-French alliance treaty, but also promote Anglo-Soviet relations. The success or failure of French foreign policy depends on this.

The most suspicious thing is that the monthly reimbursement reports of various departments of the department were not sent in the current month. Therefore, the prices of materials listed in the various ledgers may have the suspicion of underreporting and overreporting according to market prices. Regarding the Qiantang River Ferry, the management of materials and reimbursement were handled by one person, namely the accountant and cashier, which is not in accordance with the law, and there may be corrupt practices inside. Regarding the vehicles in operation, a vehicle daily report form should be filled out in accordance with the regulations, but the department did not comply, so the suspicion of private use of vehicles is very high. In terms of oil materials, the department's gas station has no clear records to compare the amount of oil received and the amount of oil used each month, which is a confusing mess. Zhang Xun, the investigator sent by the Supervisory Office, submitted a report yesterday on a part of the investigation results to Supervisory Commissioner Zhu Zongliang for review. Moreover, the Supervisory Office recently received an accusation that the department was even more involved in engineering corruption in Ningbo. The amount of corruption indicated in the original complaint is very large, and the case is more serious than the previous case. However, the Supervisory Office believes that the location of the case is far away in Ningbo, and corruption in engineering may not be detected without specialized talent. Therefore, no formal investigation has been conducted yet. For the sake of caution, experts will be hired to go to Ningbo together to investigate the truth. According to Supervisory Commissioner Zhu, speaking to this newspaper's reporter, although the above are two cases, they both involve the Department of Transportation, so they should be handled together. Therefore, the truth of the case must wait until the investigation of both cases is completed before it can be fully announced.

### Communist Troops Hastily Retreat from Shuyang, Houses in the City Fortunately Spared, Qianji Battle Fierce, Heavily Damaged

[Our Newspaper, Huaiyin News] On the 10th, amid continuous rain, the Nationalist army recovered Shuyang in one fell swoop with lightning speed. The communist troops were caught off guard, and retreated in panic, crossing the Shuyang River and fleeing towards southern Shandong. This reporter accompanied Director Sun of the Provincial Department of Civil Affairs, Wang Gongyu, and others on a jeep from the Huai River Insurance Office of the Sunning Branch to inspect the battlefield on the 11th at noon. When they reached the southern suburbs of the county, they saw the people supporting the old and the young, welcoming them on the road. Director Wang stood up in the car, comforted them, and conveyed the virtues of the central government and the provincial government. The listeners were deeply moved, and many were overjoyed and wept. An old man with white hair wept uncontrollably. After being persuaded to stop, it was learned that the old man's surname was Chen, over seventy years old, with two sons, who were both killed by the communist troops. The land was divided and the house was torn down. He could barely make a living. Now that the pain has subsided, he felt as if an infant had seen its mother, and grief came from within.

Later, the car drove into the city and inspected it for a week. The houses in the city were intact, which was somewhat comforting. It is a miracle that the cruel communist troops were able to leave this intact and hand it over to others. He immediately chose an old man to inquire. According to him, "The internal conflicts of the communist troops were fierce, and the soldiers had no fighting spirit. On the eve of the abandonment, they decided to drive the people out of the city and implement a scorched earth policy, setting the entire city on fire. Fortunately, the Nationalist army advanced rapidly, catching them off guard. If they had delayed for a moment, it would not have been preserved. We are grateful to the Nationalist army for leaving this remaining residence for us to live in. It was an unexpected stroke of luck. The communist troops are inhumane and would never let go easily. Before retreating, they killed as many as six or seven hundred good people. Now, in the six towns and townships in the urban area, there are about 3,000 households. The young and strong have been coerced away, leaving only the old, weak, women, and children, groaning in the aftermath of trampling and destruction, and seeing the light of day again."

A group of more than ten people stepped into the gate of the division headquarters of the New Security Army - part of the fake Sixth Administrative District Commissioner's Office - the houses were spacious, and Division Commander Zhang Lingfu greeted them with a smile, shaking hands with them one by one. District Commissioner Ji Yuzhi of the Seventh District called him "Victorious General." Zhang said repeatedly, "I dare not, I dare not." After sitting down, Song Zixin, the commissioner of the Social Affairs Department, discussed relief measures with Director Wang. It was decided that the Political Department should send personnel to assist the six town and township chiefs in the urban area to conduct a preliminary survey of the number of households, fill out a certificate for each household, and issue 10,000 yuan of relief money according to the certificate. Zhang Tongmo, director of the Huaiyin Office of the Suning Branch, rushed back to Huaiyin overnight to transport flour. The flour would be distributed to each household as a bag to provide emergency relief. Director Wang temporarily stayed in the county to supervise county affairs, plan for restoration, and assist in handling relief matters. However, as of late at night, County Magistrate Tang and the county government personnel had not yet arrived.

On the way back, Director Zhang told the reporter that Qianji, a town in Shuyang, faced the Liutang River. The communist troops relied on the danger to defend it to the death. The battle was fierce. Now the town is ruined, with only a pile of rubble left. The 240 bags of flour and 120 bags of soybean flour that were transported there could not find a relief recipient. Only the flour was temporarily stored in the town and entrusted to local people nearby to guide them to the four villages for on-site inspection and distribution. From this, the situation in the disaster area can be seen.

### Shanghai County Government Applies for Emergency Industrial and Commercial Loans

[Our Newspaper, Minhang News] Ni, the magistrate of Shanghai County, stated that various industrial and commercial sectors in the county have been affected by high-interest loans, resulting in sluggish business and frequent closures and liquidations. He has specifically requested the provincial government to forward the application to the Western United Relief Association for an emergency industrial and commercial loan to provide assistance. The process will involve the county government convening the County Chamber of Commerce and the Minhang Office of the Jiangsu Provincial Farmers Bank to form a syndicate and apply to the Western United Relief Association for the emergency industrial and commercial loan. The total loan amount is 30 million legal tender.

### Pinghu Arrests Two Individuals for Impersonating and Forcibly Selling Books and Newspapers

[Our Newspaper, Pinghu News] Recently, two individuals impersonating staff from the Shanghai China Cultural Supply Cooperative have been discovered in the county. They have been forcibly selling books and newspapers to various businesses and defrauding them of money, causing anger among the businesses. The Cultural Supply Cooperative recently sent a letter to the county government requesting the arrest of Shen Futang and Shen Daosheng, former employees who were dismissed, as they were selling books and newspapers in various counties and towns in the tenth district, damaging the cooperative's reputation. The county government then ordered the police to investigate and arrest them. They were captured in Xincang the day before yesterday and brought to Pinghu. They were transferred to the Judicial Office on the 16th for interrogation. However, according to Shen Futang, they are not former employees who were dismissed from the China Cultural Supply Cooperative.

### Suspicious Youths Discovered in Shengze Hongdou Village

[Our Newspaper, Wujiang News] Recently, six youths from northern Jiangsu were discovered begging from door to door in the Shengze Hongdou Village area, lingering and refusing to leave. The village self-defense force, suspecting their behavior, questioned them. They claimed to be from Pixian County in northern Jiangsu, but were evasive about other details. A search of their belongings revealed that they were all wearing grass-green lined clothing. One of them, Sun Maokai, was also found to be carrying five silver dollars and several pens and pencils. They were all sent to the district office. After questioning by District Chief Jiang, they were transferred to the Wujiang County Government for legal processing.

### Lieshan Coal Mine Resumes Operation

[Our Newspaper, Suxian News] The Lieshan Coal Mine, located near Suixi Town in this county, was first mined by local people using manual and animal labor in the thirty-second year of the Guangxu reign (Qing Dynasty), producing 100 tons of coal per day. In the fourth year of the Republic (1915), Ni Danchen took over the operation and purchased seven machines, increasing the daily output to 500 tons, and the business was thriving. During the Anti-Japanese War, the Japanese took the machines away and destroyed the buildings. After the victory, the mine shafts were demolished by the Communist army, causing a severe coal shortage in various counties of northern Anhui. Now that the area has been recovered and the security situation has gradually stabilized, Zhang Zhengyao and others have raised 30 million yuan to resume operation in order to promote business and facilitate people's livelihood. The coal shortage in northern Anhui should be resolved soon.

### "Demolishing Embankments to Build Dams" Statement Inconsistent with Facts

Wang Huzhen Explains the Truth

[Our Newspaper, Hangzhou, 18th] Wang Huzhen, Deputy Director of the Qiantang River Seawall Engineering Bureau, told our reporter yesterday that the pilot construction of a tide-blocking dam at Chenwengang in Haining County is to prevent the powerful tidal surge in that area. The stones used were from the stones abandoned in the river by the own destroyed Shitang factory, and a part of the stone embankments that were about to collapse, and 10,000 cubic meters of stone embankment were mined from Xiaojianshan. Six Japanese-style ten-wheeled trucks were shipped from Shanghai and ten boats were hired to transport the stones for use in Chenwengang. Construction is scheduled to start on the 24th. The statement that embankments were being demolished to build dams is a misrepresentation.

### Suzhou's Tax Collection Shortfall Remains Significant - Efforts Underway to Resolve Issues

[Our Newspaper, Suzhou, 18th] The Suzhou Grain Tax Office invited the press on the morning of the 18th to explain the current status of tax collection and the root causes of the shortage. According to Deputy Director Liu Disheng, the county has collected 140,000 shi of grain, but this is still a very large gap from the quota of 400,000 shi. The main problem is the tenant-landlord dispute. The total area of farmland in the county is 1.8 million mu, of which 70% is managed by landlords. The landlords insist on the established view that the tax should be paid from the rent, and they will only pay the tax after collecting the rent. The tenants, on the other hand, claim that the harvest is poor and are still hesitant despite the implementation of the 25% rent reduction, resulting in a phenomenon of arrears. This is the biggest difficulty for the grain administration. The county government has now established a Tenant-Landlord Mediation Committee to seek coordination between landlords and tenants, which is currently being actively implemented. Another important problem is that the map and household heads are holding back, intending to embezzle the funds. According to investigations by this office, it has been more than two months since the start of the land tax collection, and some grain households have not even received the tax payment notice. This is truly regrettable. Although efforts have been made to prevent the map and household heads from holding back, it is impossible to rely solely on the sixteen grain police officers to distribute the notices, as there are a total of 670,000 grain households in the county. Furthermore, the previous administration was not urgent enough, resulting in missed opportunities. The provincial order originally stipulated that tax collection should begin on September 15th, but it was not followed until November. Now the province requires that the tax be collected in full by the end of January, or severe punishment will be imposed. This office has now stipulated that a late payment penalty will be added to all payments starting from the 16th. Also, due to the previous supply of military grain, the state allowed grain to be collected in both rice and paddy. However, in order to adapt to the environment, it has been purely collecting paddy since the 15th and not accepting brown rice.

### Developing Sanmen Bay

Zhejiang Reclamation Company to Start First

[Zhenhai News] After the reclamation survey team jointly organized by the provincial government, Zhejiang Reclamation Company, Executive Yuan Zhejiang Office, and Farmers Bank returned from the survey, they unanimously agreed that developing Sanmen Bay is the most important reclamation project in Zhejiang Province and the only good policy to promote the prosperity of the Southeast. The reclaimable area of Sanmen Bay is more than 100,000 mu. The provincial government is currently drafting a report on the survey of the area, which will be submitted to the central government by Chairman Shen to request a large sum of money to start the development. Before receiving the central government's clear order to develop, the Zhejiang Reclamation Company will first develop one of the two areas in the Sanmen Bay reclamation area, Xiaowan Tang and Fenghuangshan Tang. Each of these two areas has an area of more than 3,000 mu. The Zhejiang Reclamation Company has decided to invest 100 million yuan to start construction in March this year.

### Station Manager Takes Over Car and Causes Accident

Taking Human Life as a Game

Station Manager Takes Over Car and Causes Accident

Twenty-five Passengers Injured

[Our Newspaper, Haining News] At 1:50 PM on the 16th, a car heading from Ning to Chang'an, near Shaojiaqiao, had the Haining Station Manager Zheng Bengu inside. He seized the driver's seat, insisting on learning to drive the car. The driver and passengers tried to dissuade him to no avail. After two minutes, the car overturned into the pond. Fortunately, the river was shallow, so it did not sink completely, but the car was immersed in the water, and 25 male and female passengers were injured. They immediately negotiated with the station manager of the station. Police officers and the police were notified and immediately detained him. The station manager has now volunteered to pay for medical expenses and luggage losses, but he has not yet been released.

### Executive Yuan Suning Branch's Work Plan for This Year - Zheng Tonghe's Report to Reporters

[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang News] Zheng Tonghe, Director of the Executive Yuan Suning Branch, invited reporters from Nanjing and Shanghai on the 14th to report on the branch's work plan for this year, which is divided into four areas: disaster relief, industrial relief, agricultural reclamation, social welfare:

Disaster Relief

In terms of disaster relief, since the successive recovery of the counties in northern Jiangsu, emergency relief work has been actively carried out. In addition to establishing an office in Huaiyin to handle relief affairs in various counties under Huai, working teams have also been added in Xinghua and Yancheng to handle emergency relief matters in each of these areas. In November and December of last year, about 6,000 tons of food were transported from Zhenjiang to Huaiyin, Huaian, Baoying, Gaoyou, Yancheng, Dongtai, Xinghua, and Taixian counties. 2,500 tons of flour and rice were directly transported from Shanghai to Taixian and Huaiyin Nantong and other counties. Recently, 1,000 tons of soybean flour have been directly transported from Shanghai to Haizhou and 500 tons of flour to Xuzhou for emergency relief. In January and February, a considerable amount of food will continue to be transported to Xuhai and Yanfu counties for disaster relief.

Industrial Relief

In the industrial relief sector, (1) the first phase of the Jiangnan Seawall Project has been fully completed, and the second phase of construction surveying has also been completed and is ready to start. The Yangtze River embankment restoration project has started in six counties: Jiangyin, Zhenjiang, Jiangdu, Jiangning, Liuhe, and Jiangpu. As of the end of December last year, 360,000 cubic meters of earthwork have been completed. The Northern Jiangsu Canal Project is the responsibility of the Huai River Guidance Committee, and this office has sent engineering auditors to verify the progress of the project and issue public grain. So far, 2,500 cubic meters of stone and 80,000 cubic meters of earth have been extracted. Other projects are also being actively promoted. The Zhenwu Canal Project has been established by the local Zhenwu Canal Engineering Committee to take charge of promoting the project. This office has established the Zhenwu Canal Engineering Office to issue public grain and supervise the construction. Currently, 500 tons of industrial flour has been approved. The Shaoxiang River in Haizhou has begun dredging, and this office has subsidized 200 taels of industrial flour. (2) The provincial highway in Jiangnan has been decided to start construction by the Provincial Highway Bureau, and this office has allocated 350 tons of industrial flour, which has been used to extract stone materials in Kunshan, Wujin, and Zhenjiang. The provincial highway in northern Jiangsu has been decided to first repair the sections from the port to Taixian and from Xiannvmiao to Haian. The 200 tons of industrial flour required have been allocated first, and preparations are being made to start construction. (3) For the repair of primary school buildings, the first phase of subsidies was given to 56 schools, requiring 1,500 tons of flour and soybean flour each, which has already been issued. Each school has raised its own materials to cooperate in the construction. On average, 60% has been completed. The second phase of the plan to subsidize the repair of primary school buildings has also been determined, with 95 schools in Jiangnan and 86 schools in northern Jiangsu, for a total allocation of more than 3,000 tons of flour. The recipient schools in Jiangnan counties have been determined. The situation in northern Jiangsu counties is unclear after the war damage, and it is planned to send personnel to conduct on-site inspections before issuing the subsidies. (4) For the repair of public and private hospital buildings in this area, this office has successively allocated flour to assist, such as the Provincial Zhenjiang Hospital, Wujin Public Hospital, Huaiyin Public Hospital, Gaoyou Public Hospital, Renhui Hospital, Wuxi Public Hospital, Jurong Public Hospital, etc., which are all under construction and repair with flour allocated by this office. As for hospital beds and the necessary equipment and medicines, this branch has successively allocated 1,750 sets to each hospital, and the remaining beds will be allocated after they arrive.

Agricultural Reclamation

In the agricultural reclamation part, in order to facilitate cultivation and increase agricultural production, two types of plans have been drawn up. One is the rice-growing area, using water-drawing machines for irrigation and drainage to restore and increase production. The other is the Huanghuai flooded area, using tractors to restore cultivation and increase production. On the one hand, a request has been submitted to the head office to allocate 1,085 water-drawing machines and 100 tractors for this business. On the other hand, 12 agricultural machinery technicians have been assigned to various places to investigate the agricultural machinery and the environment for its use in order to actively promote it.

Social Welfare

The main businesses in the social welfare sector that are currently being organized include the establishment of sewing factories in Nanjing and Zhenjiang to select strong middle-aged women from the refugees to rush to make cotton clothes and transport them to the recovered areas of northern Jiangsu for distribution. 20,000 cotton clothes have already been made. Congee factories have been established in Zhenjiang, Taizhou, Rugao, Yangzhou, Huaiyin, Xuzhou, Nanjing, and other places, where this office allocates rice to cook porridge to help generally starving refugees. Children's nutrition stations have been established in Nanjing, Zhenjiang, Changzhou, Suzhou, Nantong, and Taizhou, with a total of 37 stations, and about 15,000 children come to the stations to drink milk every day. Other activities, such as operating affordable cafeterias and assisting charitable organizations, are all being actively promoted according to the planned plan.

Visiting the Sewing Factory

[Zhenjiang News] Zheng Tonghe, Director of the Executive Yuan Suning Branch, hosted reporters in the auditorium of the branch at noon on the 14th to explain the general outline of the work for the 36th year in detail. At 2:00 PM, Wang Guang, director of the relief affairs group, invited reporters to visit the sewing factory organized by the group at the Windmill Mountain in Zhenjiang. The sewing factory is located at the former site of the Rongshi Girls' Middle School, with a beautiful environment and spacious buildings. It was prepared and arranged by the relief affairs group in late October last year and officially started construction on December 2nd. The interior is divided into five departments: cutting cloth room, machine sewing room, hand sewing room, bundling room, and cutting room. There are 27 American sewing machines, five cutting technicians are hired, and 83 female workers. The work is presided over by one administrator, and American experts provide occasional guidance. All the female workers are destitute or refugee women who have been carefully selected and hired. The daily wage is 2,500 yuan, the factory provides lunch every day, and supplements two bags of second-class flour every month. It is reported that the factory can produce more than 10,000 sets of cotton clothes and pants every month. Before the end of last year, 8,000 sets of cotton clothes and pants had been shipped out to provide relief to refugees in the Fuyang area of Huaiyin County.

### Additional Hometown-Return Special Train on the Pukou-Xuzhou Section of the Jinpu Railway

[Our Newspaper, Mingguang News] In order to facilitate passengers returning home for the Lunar New Year, the Pukou-Xuzhou section of the Jinpu Railway is adding two special express trains every day from January 14th, running between Pukou and Xuzhou. The train departs from Pukou at 10:00 PM every night.

### Scope of Amnesty for Traitor Cases Limited to Harboring Crime and Concealing Illegal Assets - Explanation by Head of Jiangsu High Court

[Our Newspaper, Suzhou, 18th] Prosecutor Li Shudong of the Jiangsu High Procuratorate went to the First Prison on the afternoon of the 18th to release a total of thirteen prisoners under amnesty. Our reporter specially visited the heads of the court and procuratorate to inquire about the nature of the crimes of the amnestied prisoners. We were told that those released today were all sentenced by the puppet court, which was declared invalid, and the sentences were retried and met the requirements of the amnesty ordinance. For those who have appealed and are still under trial but have not yet been sentenced, if they meet the amnesty requirements, they should be given a verdict of dismissal and then released. Regarding traitor cases, only those who have violated Article 6 of the Punishment of Traitors Ordinance for harboring traitors and Article 12 for concealing illegal assets can be pardoned. The rest have no hope of even a reduced sentence. The reporter then inquired with the High Court detention center about the possible number of releases. According to the person in charge, there are currently 200 county prisoners who have appealed on non-traitor charges who may be eligible for amnesty. However, due to the different crimes, a list must be prepared by category and submitted to the high court for approval before they can be released.

[Our Newspaper, Suzhou, 18th] The Wudi Procuratorate continued to pardon and release more than ten criminal offenders, such as opium injuries and family offenses, from the detention center on the 18th.

### Youth League Holds General Verification and Issues Letter to All Members

(Continued from page 2)

(3) Firmly Uphold Occupational Positions and Participate in Grassroots Construction

During the First National Congress of the Youth League, the League Leader published his own book, "The Destiny of China," instructing young people to strive for the five construction movements and encouraging young people to become engineers, pilots, border reclamation workers, primary school teachers, and township self-government officials. At this Second National Congress, the League Leader further urged us to strive for the five constructions. The Second National Congress declaration also clearly stated that our future work direction should tend towards active construction and should shift from empty political activities to social grassroots service work. These inspirations are awakening a basic understanding among our young comrades: that the reason why our country's past democracy could not be implemented was mainly due to the prevailing concept of becoming officials, and the reason why the people's livelihood could not be implemented was mainly due to the prevailing concept of getting rich. In the future, the country will embark on a new stage of democratic constitutionalism, and the Youth League's organizational and leadership methods should also embark on a new stage, so that young people can participate in actual politics in a democratic way, generated from mass elections, to block the way for individuals to seek official positions, thereby eradicating the group of idlers who do not work for their gain. We must use democratic forces to ensure the thorough implementation of the principle of people's livelihood, to block the way for individuals to speculate and get rich, thereby eradicating the idle capital forces that hinder the normal development of the social economy. If we young people want to make China a modernized country, we must all be determined, determine our career path, pick up our tools, enter farms, factories, mines, and research rooms, engage in actual production and technical work, and directly contribute our bodies, minds, and hands to the great cause of building the country. This great cause will require a very difficult process. Today, we must patiently pick up backward tools, endure the meager rewards of our occupational positions, to lay the initial foundation for national construction. In order to effectively lead young people onto the path of occupational production, we must hold a general verification of League members to check the members of this revolutionary group and determine our new path for organization and leadership.

(4) Establish a Revolutionary Style and Complete the Verification Task

The Third Plenary Session of the Youth League reviewed the work of the past eight years and concluded that some passive elements and perfunctory styles still remained in our revolutionary ranks, thereby reducing the League's initiative, revolutionary nature, fighting spirit, and political nature. The existence of this shortcoming is not accidental and must be corrected thoroughly by launching an active self-criticism and mutual criticism movement throughout the League. Therefore, holding a general verification of League members is a kind of active and broad revolutionary education, using this to educate our cadres and comrades to bravely and automatically correct our shortcomings, so that our revolutionary group can continue to progress and constantly generate a lively new force. The goal of our verification is to strengthen the League's revolutionary force, and our verification method must be very objective, working for the benefit of the revolution. We must strictly implement our verification work with the spirit of being willing to do the task and "hating evil as an enemy." Whether cadres or League members, they should deeply recognize this meaning, be diligent and conscientious, and handle the verification carefully. Qualified League members must be re-sworn and register their property to show our loyalty to the ideology and the League Leader, as well as our determination to truly implement unity, serve the country faithfully, and serve the people. To build the country and reform society, we must first start by reforming ourselves. A revolutionary group must have the courage to face all the real shortcomings, and everyone must have the greatest determination, be impartial and unselfish, and correct them at all times. It must be known that tolerance can breed evil, and only by removing corruption can new life be generated. We must awaken the common vigilance of the entire League from top to bottom, thoroughly eliminate all backward thoughts and actions, and all corrupt elements, and establish a revolutionary style, so as to prevent our general verification of League members this time.

Comrades: Although our current revolutionary environment is full of dangers and obstacles, and reactionary forces are still trying to destroy and hinder us, when we recall the adversity of our Founding Father when he was carrying out the revolution, it was many times greater than today. With an indomitable spirit, the Founding Father finally eliminated the reactionary forces and overthrew the Manchu government in the Xinhai Revolution. Later, during the era of the Chinese Revolutionary Party and when the Party was reorganized in the thirteenth year, the Founding Father was able to adapt to the needs of the times and rectify the revolutionary ranks to lead the National Revolution forward. Today, under the wise and great leadership of the League Leader, to continue the revolutionary will of the Founding Father, at a time when the sacred national resistance war has won victory and the democratic constitution has been promulgated, we comrades can confidently overcome all current difficulties and eliminate all reactionary forces to thoroughly implement the Three Principles of the People and complete the historical task of revolutionary nation-building.

Dear comrades, now is the best opportunity for us to give full play to our conscience and use the highest wisdom of openness and purity to redouble our efforts to improve the League's affairs. We should join hands, shoulder to shoulder, and actively participate in the general verification and move towards the great road of building the League and building the country. January 15, 36th year of the Republic of China.

### Private School Tuition Fee Problems

Mr. Reporter: Recently, the issue of private schools increasing tuition fees has sparked much discussion. We believe that this is a serious educational problem and should not be judged solely on emotion, nor should all genuinely well-run private school authorities be regarded as "birds of a feather" based on a few isolated examples.

Under the principle of universal education, we hope that all school-age children in the country have the opportunity to receive education. There are 450,000 school-age children in Shanghai, and on average, each school can accommodate 500 students, so 900 national schools should be established. However, due to limited funding, public schools only number 227, accounting for only one-quarter of the need. The remaining three-quarters of school-age children have no choice but to seek placement in private schools. If public schools are overcrowded and private schools cannot operate, most families below the middle class, confined to small rooms with no room to maneuver, will see their lively and active children wandering the streets in groups!

Those familiar with education are aware of the varying levels of private school students and are also concerned about the quality of private school teachers. Many private school principals, in order to hire excellent teachers, have to increase the salaries of teachers to ensure their livelihood. However, tuition income cannot keep up with rising prices, so before the end of the semester, they have to raise funds to provide "living expenses" subsidies for teachers, and even when their own resources are insufficient, they have to seek help from the public. For example, last year's "Respect Teachers Movement" aimed to raise a "Respect Teachers Fund." Although it was criticized by some people at the time, the motivation behind the movement cannot be considered wrong. We absolutely advocate that private school principals, under the principle of economic transparency, do their best to maintain the teachers' living standards and improve their teaching efficiency. In other words, as long as the finances are transparent, how much more tuition the parents increase will allow the teachers to teach with peace of mind and patiently guide their children, and isn't it their own children who will directly benefit? This is much better than raising donations from strangers, using the money to fill the teachers' bellies, and then having them teach your children, isn't it? The Constitution has been promulgated, and the people should have more legal protection, and teachers should also have more job security. We hope that all private school authorities will be able to run schools fairly and share the joys and hardships with the teachers, and re-educate for the rebirth of the country. We absolutely cannot bear to regard the noble "academies" as shops. We hope that the principals who preside over the "academies" will not feel discouraged and disappointed because of the criticism of a few people. I am a police officer who reads your newspaper every day. Last time I read about the adjustment of civil servant salaries, the police, including all expenses, were discounted to 70% or 80%, totaling 155,000 yuan. The authorities understood the situation and, during the Lunar New Year, advanced January's new salary before the 15th of this month for the police officers' New Year expenses. However, so far, the various branches have not received notification orders regarding the increase. I'm afraid that's the case! If we take January's salary first for the New Year expenses, may I ask the fair gentlemen, how can this small amount solve the long-standing financial problems of the police officers? After the Lunar New Year, won't the police have to live? My family has nine members, my parents are almost sixty years old, my younger siblings are still in school, and my poor wife is taking care of three little girls. I earn 111,500 yuan per month. With the current prices soaring like balloons, everything in my house has been sold! We police officers have great responsibilities, protecting the lives and property of the people, and we are not even comparable to the treatment of a little girl working in a factory, who has year-end bonuses, attendance bonuses, and work bonuses, plus an extra month's salary. We are role models for the people, and we are knowledgeable. We do not speak, do not strike, do not slack off, and quietly wait for the authorities to solve our difficulties. Fair gentlemen, please give us police officers some sympathy! (Li Yaoxiang)

The Demarcation of Provinces and Municipalities Should Be Decided Quickly

The problem of demarcating the boundary between Shanghai and Jiangsu Province has been disputed for over a year. This time, the Ministry of Interior sent personnel to conduct on-site surveys with both the province and the city, promising to resolve the issue as soon as possible. The following opinions and wishes are presented:

(1) Shanghai is the gateway to the Yangtze River, located in the prosperous region south of the Yangtze River, and is the center of wealth concentration in the country. Its superior conditions are sufficient to help it develop into a world-class metropolis. Dr. Sun Yat-sen foresaw this and formulated the Greater Shanghai Plan. In the 16th year of the Republic of China, the Executive Yuan also established the boundaries of Shanghai as the foundation for its development. Today, we should follow the original plan and follow the instructions of the visionary to promote the early completion of the plan, rather than delaying the development.

(2) In this World War, the major ports in the Far East, such as Manila, Tokyo, Osaka, Hong Kong, and Singapore, have all suffered serious damage and are difficult to restore. Shanghai has suffered the least damage and is the easiest to recover, so it is more hopeful to develop into a world-class metropolis. The post-war population of the city has increased by one-third compared to before the war, which is clear evidence, and it is still continuing to develop, with unlimited prospects. Therefore, the expansion of the city's area is already urgent. Even without Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Shanghai Plan showing the way, it should be given reasonable expansion to meet the needs of the times.

(3) Neighboring counties, using the maintenance of historical relations as an excuse, refuse to transfer the areas that Shanghai should take over, which is obviously shortsighted and disregards the facts. Moreover, the so-called historical relations are not immutable. Looking at the world's first-class cities, they have all gradually expanded. Therefore, if the Jiangsu Provincial Government insists on its established ideas under the pretext of maintaining historical relations, it will force Shanghai to have no hope of keeping pace with the world's major cities. This is not only detrimental to the development of Shanghai, but also to the interests of the entire country. The Jiangsu Provincial Government should prioritize national interests and abandon its established ideas.

(4) The areas in dispute between the province and the city, in terms of the total area of Jiangsu Province, are like a drop in the bucket, which does not affect the overall situation, but it is indispensable to the development of Shanghai and is of great benefit. Moreover, both belonging to the province and belonging to the city are under the central government, so the Jiangsu Provincial Government has no need to insist on not letting go.

(5) The living habits of the people in the disputed areas have long been completely assimilated with Shanghai due to the rapid development of transportation, and they are alienated from the original county governments. Therefore, in terms of the people's living habits, the scope of Shanghai should also be expanded to meet the trend of natural circumstances.

(6) Taking Qibao Town as an example, it was originally under the jurisdiction of Shangsong and Qing counties, which led to the inability to unify administration. For hundreds of years, the suffering of the people has been countless. Therefore, it is even more necessary to adjust the affiliation and completely incorporate it into Shanghai to achieve the unity of the entire town.

(7) Since the victory, all the Baotian organizations, health institutions, and educational undertakings in Shanghai, Qibao, and Xinzhuang have been gradually established by Shanghai. If they are still ordered to be returned to Jiangsu Province, there will inevitably be disturbances again. Changes in orders will leave the people at a loss. In order to maintain the government's prestige, it should not be changed again.

(8) In the past, the boundary lines between the province and the city were unclear, which often caused disputes. If the boundary line set in the 16th year of the Republic of China is used as the standard (the Xiaolai River in the west is the boundary between the province and the city), it will not only conform to the principle of using natural boundary lines as the boundary demarcation, but also make the boundary lines between the province and the city more neat and clear, which will be of great benefit to the future implementation of administration.

In addition to jointly requesting the Ministry of Interior to order the provincial and municipal authorities to transfer the areas, we beg to disclose the above points to show the public's sentiments.

Request for Road Repair on Xiangde Road

The road surface of Xiangde Road has always been a coal and bamboo road. It has not been repaired for more than ten years, and it has been frequently traversed by ten-wheeled trucks, forming large and small potholes. After it rains, the road becomes a swamp, with no place to put your feet. Most of the residents living on the road are engaged in business and do not understand the procedures, so they specially request your newspaper to publish this, so that the Public Works Bureau can be informed and carry out repairs. If the cost of building the road is too high, the sidewalk can be filled in. Even if it costs a little money, the residents are willing to contribute. The rainy season is approaching soon, and we also beg the Public Works Bureau to order the authorities to handle it as soon as possible, which is what the residents are looking forward to day and night.

### Vice Ministers of the Four Powers Draft the German Peace Treaty; The Soviet Union Proposes Four Suggestions; Resolving the Reparations Issue Will Be the Most Difficult; Britain and France Advocate Establishing a German Central Government

[Agence France-Presse, London, 17th] The vice ministers of the four powers began drafting the peace treaty with Germany this afternoon. First, they determined the order in which the governments of the Allied nations would be present to present their opinions. Then, they discussed the instructions given by the four foreign ministers to their vice ministers, especially the instructions on procedural matters. The Soviet representative, Gusev, proposed the following four suggestions:

(1) Determine the content of the draft treaty for submission to the Moscow meeting of the four foreign ministers for discussion. (2) Consult with the other Allied nations. (3) All countries that actively participated in the war against Germany should be allowed to participate in the review of the peace treaty. (4) Regarding the final drafting of the peace treaty and its implementation after signing. The representatives welcomed Gusev's suggestions, but the French representative, M. de Merville, insisted that the cooperation of the Allied nations should be closer to avoid errors and delays. Today's meeting was quite optimistic due to the Soviet representative's relaxed attitude. It is now scheduled to continue discussing the Austrian peace treaty on the 20th and the German peace treaty on the 21st.

[Reuters, London, 17th] The timetable for the four foreign ministers' representatives' meeting on the German issue to listen to the opinions of the representatives of small countries has been revised as follows: Australia, January 23rd; Yugoslavia, 24th; Canada, 25th; Poland, 27th; South Africa, 28th; Belgium, 29th. The representatives of the four powers analyzed the following issues this afternoon for discussion: (1) The drafting plan to be adopted by the foreign ministers' meeting, (2) The method of the foreign ministers' meeting to seek the opinions of the Allied governments, (3) The method of discussing the draft treaty with the Allied governments, (4) The procedure for the final stage of drafting.

[Associated Press, London, 17th] British sources predicted today that the Soviet Union will borrow $5 billion from the United States as a price for reducing its demands for reparations from Germany. The most difficult issue for the foreign ministers' representatives when drafting the German and Austrian peace treaties is the reparations issue. According to The Economist magazine, the Soviet Union has demanded $10 billion in reparations from Germany, but obtaining half of that amount now would be of greater economic value than obtaining the full amount.

[United Press, London, 17th] The British representative suggested at the four foreign ministers' meeting today that the organization of a temporary German government should be discussed immediately so that an agreement on the administration of Germany could be reached before the final peace treaty is signed. The Soviet representative, Gusev, replied to this suggestion: I do not have the authority to discuss this issue at the four vice ministers' meeting and should submit it to the Moscow meeting of the four foreign ministers for discussion. The French representative hinted that he would like the four powers to first reach an agreement on the establishment of a German central government, and then sign the final peace treaty with it. It is reported that Yugoslavia's demand for 1,200 square miles of territory in Austrian Carinthia surprised Britain and the United States because it was three times greater than expected.

[Associated Press, London, 17th] The four foreign ministers' representatives' meeting has decided that the Austrian peace treaty should clearly stipulate that it cannot be merged with Germany. The representatives have also agreed to recognize Austria as an independent country, but they want it to ensure a democratic government and ensure that its people enjoy various basic human rights. An agreement has been reached on the preamble to the Austrian peace treaty. Its content does not praise or criticize Austria, but briefly describes its history, pointing out that it was once controlled by Germany, thereby reducing its war responsibility. The representatives also agreed that the main text of the Austrian treaty should be divided into three chapters: political, military, and economic. The draft of the political chapter should be submitted for discussion next Monday. The Soviet representative stated that the Soviet government may not intend to issue a draft of the Austrian treaty and will express its opinions when discussing the drafts submitted by other powers. The representatives also decided not to circulate all documents to small countries, but only to provide them to a country when it requests to see them. As for the invitation to small countries to present their opinions, it can be sent out this weekend, and their representatives will be notified by telephone when they are invited to attend.

### Our Government Requests to Retain Due Rights in the German Peace Treaty

[Central News Agency, London, 17th Dispatch] Our government has submitted a memorandum to the British Foreign Office through its embassy in Britain regarding our country's rights in the future German peace conference and has submitted the same document to the United States, France, and the Soviet Union. It is reported that China's memorandum follows the Potsdam Agreement and requests to retain the same rights as the other invited countries of the peace conference.

### Foreign Ministers' Meeting Announces Text of Five-Nation Peace Treaties; Byrnes Scheduled to Sign Tomorrow; Formal Signing Ceremony to Be Held in Paris Next Month

[United Press, Washington, 17th] The four foreign ministers' meeting announced today the final text of the first batch of peace treaties of World War II, namely the peace treaties with Italy, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Finland. Its content (see this newspaper on October 15th of last year) is the same as that disclosed during the negotiations in Paris and New York and has no new features. Each peace treaty is printed in English, French, and Russian translations, totaling 781 pages.

[Associated Press, Washington, 17th] Outgoing Secretary of State Byrnes is scheduled to sign the peace treaties with Italy, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Romania on Monday morning. This may be the last official business he conducts before handing over diplomatic affairs to Marshall. Incoming Secretary of State Marshall is still staying in Hawaii. Everything here has been arranged to prepare for his flight here at the end of this week. As soon as Byrnes signs the peace treaties, he will be sworn into office. The Finnish peace treaty does not require Byrnes' signature because the United States did not declare war on that country. After signing here, the peace treaties of each country must be sent to London and Moscow for signature by British Foreign Secretary Bevin and Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, and then sent to Paris for signature by other relevant countries, and it is scheduled to be signed on February 10 by the five former enemy countries of Italy, Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania, and Finland.

### Distribution of Italian Fleet Specified in Peace Treaty

[Reuters, Washington, 17th] The State Department today announced the annexes to the Italian peace treaty, revealing for the first time the details of the distribution of the Italian fleet. The names of the ships had been kept secret to prevent the crew from deliberately sabotaging them. Authorities believe that the list of ships was finalized by the Naval Committee of the New York Foreign Ministers' Conference. The committee still needs to consult with the governments of the four powers to determine which ship should be handed over to which of the four powers. If this issue cannot be resolved by the Naval Committee or through diplomatic channels, it may be discussed again at the Moscow meeting of the four foreign ministers. The signing of the Italian peace treaty will not be affected by the distribution of Italian ships by the four powers. According to the annexes, Italy will lose three battleships, five cruisers, seven destroyers, six torpedo boats, eight submarines, and one sloop. The remaining ships can be retained by Italy. The three lost battleships are the "Caesar," "Italy," and "Vittorio Veneto." The lost cruisers are the "Savoy," "Brindisi," "Garibaldi," "Montecuccoli," and "Caduna."

### Britain and the United States to Issue Joint Announcement Raising German Industrial Standards; Taking Unified Action to Deal with the Soviet Union

[Associated Press, Berlin, 17th] British and American occupation authorities stated today that they will issue a notice to Germans in the British and American occupation zones within days, stipulating that German industry should be allowed to exceed the previous four-power agreement so that Germany's economic center of gravity can be shifted from traditional heavy industry to light industry and textiles. This joint action by Britain and the United States is to deal with the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union had told representatives of the pro-Soviet German Socialist Party that the industry in the Soviet occupation zone would increase by 200% to 300%, that the Soviet occupation zone would stop dismantling factories as reparations, and that the current reparations for German products would also be reduced.

[United Press, Berlin, 18th] Soviet military commander in Berlin, Kotikov, today canceled the order for individual identity verification within Berlin. The previous order was intended to search for missing war criminals and soldiers who had not officially taken leave of absence. Kotikov explained the reason for this move, fearing that it would hinder Berlin's social activities this winter. However, it is widely believed that the real purpose of this move is to prevent the German police under the authority of the four powers from forcibly sending people from Belarus, Ukraine, and the Baltic states back to their countries.

### U.S. State Department Announces Strict Screening of Employees

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 17th] The State Department announced that its secret committee is currently investigating 3,000 new employees to determine whether they are loyal to the country. Fifty-three of them are being investigated especially. It is reported that an intelligence agent of the department has been charged with leaking military secrets.

### U.S. Antarctic Expedition Lands on Ice Horn

[Associated Press, aboard the warship "Mount Olympus" in the Arctic Ocean, 17th] The reconnaissance team of the U.S. Navy Antarctic Expedition landed on the south side of Antarctic Ice Horn today to study strategies for overcoming ice ridges and opening a road to the Little America base. The group, including ice-breaking experts, was transported to Whale Bay by the icebreaker "Northwind," while three other ships anchored outside. The ice-breaking experts will study methods for filling the ice surface to facilitate the loading and unloading of two 7,000-ton cargo ships. The only convenience for the expedition team is that the surface of the ice rock is smooth, and the construction of supports will not be too difficult. It is now planned to set up tents on the ice rock to accommodate the engineering team. The expedition team may have to be trapped by the ice. At that time, the floating ice can solidify as hard as cement.

[Reuters, Paris, 17th] French Minister for Overseas Colonies Moutet said in the National Defense Committee of the House of Representatives today that the French government has decided to transfer all the reinforcements requested by the staff headquarters to Vietnam. Although France does not want to give up the opportunity for negotiations, a policy of force is also absolutely necessary, so this policy will continue to be implemented. If the Viet Minh army's attack on Hanoi achieves its purpose, 12,000 French people will be massacred, he said.

[Associated Press, Saigon, 17th] Outside of the major cities in Cochinchina, France has lost all control. According to Cochinchina President Ho Van Ngang, terrorist activities are more intense than before. The Kuomintang has dismantled a section of the railway between Saigon and My Tho.

### Viet Troops Fiercely Attack Hanoi Airport

[Associated Press, Hanoi, 17th] Viet troops attacked Hanoi's main airport last night and this morning, engaging in hand-to-hand combat with French troops for several hours. The fierceness of the offensive was rare in past battles. Viet troops had infiltrated near the airport runway last night but were discovered by French troops and repelled by machine gun fire. At the same time, the gardens surrounding the French Commissioner's Office were also shelled by Viet artillery.

[Reuters, Paris, 18th] The left-wing "Combat" newspaper reported that the French Defense Committee, after listening to a report on the situation in Vietnam, decided to send a total of 16,000 reinforcements to Vietnam. Defense Minister Lecrerc and Minister for Overseas Colonies Moutet both reported to the committee. A total of 444 seats.

### Polish General Election Begins; Parliament Is Unicameral; A Total of 444 Seats

Among them, 300,000 people have been disqualified because they cooperated with Germany. As for the allegation by the leader of the Peasant Party, Mikolajczyk, that voters in 96 villages were not included in the list, I have not heard of it. All the measures I have taken have been carried out in accordance with the law. The parliament will be unicameral with a total of 444 seats, and there are currently 1,075 candidates.

### American and French Rule of Law: Mrs. Roosevelt's Driver's License Revoked Without Complaint

[Central News Agency, New York, 17th] Mrs. Roosevelt's driver's license has recently been revoked by the state of New York. She was involved in a car accident last August in which five people were injured, including herself. This incident proves that in the United States, even the former First Lady is not above the law. Mrs. Roosevelt has no complaints about the state government's decision. In her daily column, she stated that although she is familiar with driving, she has no intention of making any special requests. She believes that those who cause accidents while driving should accept the consequences.

### Britain Accepts Burmese Demands, but Burmese Independence Date Undecided

[Our Report] London, 18th. In the Anglo-Burmese negotiations in London, Britain has fully accepted all Burmese demands except for the date of Burmese independence.

The Burmese delegation made three demands: (1) immediate declaration of Burmese independence; (2) a specific date for the withdrawal of British troops from Burma; and (3) the immediate establishment of a Burmese interim government to replace the current Executive Council. However, British officials believe that no action can be taken until after the general election in Burma in April of this year.

### Viewing Allied-Occupied Japan Through the Eyes of a Briton (Part 2)

— Original by John Morris, Translated by Zhang Deqian

(II) Two Tasks

To assess the achievements of the first year of the occupation, it is necessary to understand the purpose of the occupation. In my view, the occupation forces have two main tasks. First, to eliminate Japan's war potential, both real and potential, to prevent her from harming us again in the future. Second, to permanently eliminate the Japanese people's will to disrupt world peace. Naturally, these two objectives are complementary in a sense, especially the second, which is the root of many other problems and is obviously more important.

Military Power No Longer Exists

Japan's military power has been largely destroyed and is no longer a threat to us. Acres of ruined factories are evidence of this. Moreover, Japan now has neither an army nor a navy, and most of her merchant ships were sunk before the end of the war. Today's Japan seems similar to Germany after the end of World War I, but in fact, it is not comparable. Germany had thousands of miles of land borders and sufficient domestic raw materials to supply the heavy industries necessary for war. Once the occupation ended, nothing could stop Germany from rearming. Furthermore, the destruction and disruption of German industrial resources in World War I were insignificant by today's standards; in other words, although the Allies were victorious, Germany's war potential was not destroyed at all.

As for Japan today, her territory has been reduced to four main contiguous islands, the so-called Japanese mainland. She now has neither an army nor a navy, and all strategic bases in the Pacific are in the hands of the Allies, making it easy for the Allies to control all domestic activities in Japan. Another point to note is that Japan's heavy industry relies entirely on imports. She produces very little iron domestically, which is useless for manufacturing high-grade steel, and Japan's coal is only sufficient for domestic use. Therefore, we can believe that the first objective of the occupation of Japan (i.e., destroying Japan's war potential), even if not yet completed, is not far from completion. Of course, Japan will not be able to obtain the necessary materials and equipment to engage in atomic research.

Let us now turn to the second, longer-term, and more important task of occupying Japan. It is somewhat difficult to assess the progress of this task here, because there is no suitable standard to measure whether the progress is fast or slow. So I just want to report the facts and let the readers make their own judgments.

Stubborn Mindset Difficult to Change

I lived in Japan for six months this time and spoke with hundreds of Japanese people from all walks of life. I never noticed that they had the slightest intention of admitting their mistakes. Most people's attitudes are the same as before the war. Several times I even wondered if this war had ever happened, because in certain strata of Japanese society (especially senior civil servants), mentioning the war seems to be a breach of etiquette. However, most Japanese people have realized their defeat, but at the same time, they believe that their leaders' fault was not in doing the wrong thing, but in not doing it well. Everyone is talking about the newly discovered democracy, but I have never met a Japanese person who can give a satisfactory definition of democracy. Now all Japanese people are willing and hope to engage in democracy, but most Japanese people are obviously just engaging in it, with little fundamental change in their thinking. Only among intellectuals and students are there people who truly hope for drastic changes.

To destroy Japan's war will, in my opinion, is fundamentally a long-term educational problem. But before discussing this issue in detail, we must first outline its economic and political implications, because they are directly related to the solution of the entire educational problem.

Allied Unity is of Utmost Importance

We seem to have to restore the Japanese economy to a considerable extent to prevent her from becoming a burden to the Allies. The main difficulty lies in deciding how Japan's industry should be reorganized so that it can no longer be used for war. The organization of Japanese industry must be based on the interests of the Allies and the world. We have made some progress in this area, but this progress has been hampered by the instability of the general world situation and the apparent conflicts of interest of the countries concerned. The most obvious examples are food policy and the issue of reparations. Almost every Allied conference held in Tokyo discovers several new difficulties. If it were not for the fundamentally different ideologies that exist between the three major powers and the Soviet Union, most of these difficulties would be easily resolved.

In addition to the increasingly obvious ideological conflicts, there is also a less obvious competition for permanent political influence. In this competition, only the Americans can proceed smoothly. Ideological issues are even more important in the reorganization of Japan's political and social system. Within this scope, the least real progress is worth recording. Japan's social and political reorganization will inevitably develop according to the American model, and as a result, the influence of other countries must be reduced proportionally.

### Collision at Wusong Estuary at Midnight: Zhi Jiang Sinks: Slight Casualties Among More Than 800 Passengers

[Our Report] The Zhi Jiang, a ship on the Shanghai route of the Tongji Shipping Company, departed from Shanghai at 9:00 p.m. on the 17th, fully loaded with passengers. When the ship arrived at the Wusong Estuary, it collided with the Hua Tong, an iron barge of the Gongyi Tugboat Company, in the dark. The Zhi Jiang was an old wooden-hulled ship. After the collision, the hull immediately ruptured and gradually sank. There were more than 800 passengers on board. At the time of the accident, people were shouting for help. Fortunately, many small iron boats specializing in rescue near the Wusong Estuary rushed to the scene of the accident and immediately carried out rescue operations. By about 4:00 a.m., more than 700 people had been rescued. It is reported that there were still several bodies in the lower hold of the Zhi Jiang. According to eyewitnesses at the scene, many male and female passengers were knocked into the Huangpu River, and their bodies were carried away by the waves. However, the exact number of deaths is currently unknown. After the incident, the water police authorities took Wang Lexing, the second mate of the Zhi Jiang (Tongji Shipping Company), and Zhang Jinsheng, the owner of the Hua Tong, into custody for questioning. According to Wang Lexing, a native of Fenghua who lives at No. 44, Lane 393, Pingliang Road, Yangshupu, the Zhi Jiang was carrying more than 800 passengers. The Hua Tong was an empty ship entering the port. When the accident occurred, I pulled the horn twice, but the Hua Tong did not have a mast light and did not honk back. Moreover, there were iron barges on both sides, making it difficult to avoid the collision, so the accident occurred. Zhang Jinsheng claimed that the Hua Tong was entering the port according to regulations, sailing close to the stone embankment. Because the Zhi Jiang wanted to cross in front of my ship, it was hit in the middle. Although the Zhi Jiang had pulled its whistle, it was too late to avoid the collision.

### Child Rescued and Revived

It is also learned that most of the passengers on the Zhi Jiang this time were small merchants. Many items were salvaged from the ship, including a military blanket, a bag of tin foil, a silk cotton robe, a cloth gown, checkered shirt and pants, three torn cotton quilts, several pairs of socks, nineteen children's hats, a bed sheet, fifty-three packs of cigarettes, two cans of biscuits, a gray blanket, a wooden box, a pair of children's rubber shoes, a pair of casual shoes, and 100,000 yuan in legal tender. These goods are temporarily stored at the water police substation and will be transferred to the branch office for safekeeping.

Also, during the rescue operation until about 4:00 a.m. at dawn, most of the passengers had been rescued. At that time, police officer Xu Yinguang, No. 10147, suddenly heard knocking sounds from the ship's hatch. He then kicked away the window board with force and discovered a child of fourteen or fifteen years old (surname unknown, from Taixing). At that time, the water had already submerged his head and neck, and his life was hanging by a thread. So he was rescued and revived.

It is also reported that the injured passengers of the Zhi Jiang were sent to the Sino-American Hospital for treatment. There were two seriously injured and five slightly injured. Among them, Yang Yan, Tanaka Nan, Cao Cangzheng, Chen Jinglin, and Wang Zhaoyue were discharged from the hospital after being bandaged. One of the seriously injured, Cai Zhilin, died before reaching the hospital. The other, Zhou Haigen, was still in critical condition due to his injuries. It is reported that Zhou is forty-four years old and a native of Taixing. He and the deceased Cai Zhilin were originally relatives and came to Shanghai to purchase goods for the New Year. The two fell into the water when the accident happened the night before, and were rescued by people. However, due to drinking too much water and being injured by an iron hook during the rescue, Cai died of his injuries before reaching the hospital.

### Director of the Navigation Administration Speaks

According to Li Gufan, Director of the Shanghai Navigation Administration, the responsibility for the Zhi Jiang accident is still under investigation. However, the Navigation Administration's limit for the number of passengers on the Zhi Jiang was 357 people. It is now learned that the ship was carrying more than twice that number of passengers. Therefore, the Tongji Company authorities should bear full responsibility for this accident. In addition to sending personnel to the scene of the accident with the company's personnel to conduct a detailed investigation, the company authorities have been ordered to report the details of the accident to the Navigation Administration. The Navigation Administration has also ordered the Tongji Company to properly handle the aftermath and, in the short term, discuss and decide on the compensation for the dead and injured passengers of the Zhi Jiang and the loss of property. Li also said that the Navigation Administration has always been very strict in its inspection of wooden-hulled ships before sailing. After this accident, the inspection standards will be further raised, and the operation of wooden-hulled ships will be gradually banned to reduce the occurrence of such unfortunate incidents.

It is reported that the ticket sales this time were all handled by the Universal Transportation Company. The Tongji Company authorities did not know in advance that there were so many passengers. Therefore, the Universal Transportation Company is also responsible for the accident this time. Also, some of the passengers who were rescued yesterday have been sent back to Shanghai by the Tongji Company by car. These passengers immediately went to the Tongji Company in the Cishu Building to demand a refund of their tickets, causing disturbances.

### Rushing Home, a Huge Crowd at the North Station

[Our Report] The Lunar New Year is approaching, and people from other places who are living in Shanghai are busy going home for the New Year. The "North Station" is crowded with people and you can't even breathe. As soon as the train takes away a thousand, two thousand more passengers pour in. In recent days, the ticket office at the North Station has sold as many as 16,472 tickets for the Beijing-Shanghai line on the busiest day, and 6,099 tickets for the Shanghai-Hangzhou line. Adding in the tickets sold by the Sichuan North Road Business Office and the China Travel Service, there are a total of 30,000 tickets. Imagine 30,000 people crowding at the North Station to take the train, how can it not be crowded? There are also about 20,000 passengers coming to Shanghai from other places.

In order to enable workers' groups to return home, the Railway Bureau has added the Shanghai-Zhenjiang fourth-class train (ticket price is 3,000 yuan) and the Shanghai-Changzhou fourth-class train (ticket price is 2,500 yuan) since the 8th of this month.

It is really not easy to spend the Lunar New Year in the North Station!

(2) Diplomatic envoys from various countries, senior military officials, and consular officials. (3) Leading officials of major state-owned institutions, leaders of industry, commerce, and academia in Beijing and Shanghai.

### Shanghai National Guard Training Planned by Civil Affairs Department; Preliminary Work to Survey Robust Men First

Zhang Xiaosong, Director of the Civil Affairs Department of the city, made a statement to the reporters of the East China News Agency yesterday regarding the issue of National Guard training in this city: It is said that the National Guard training in this city is the most basic task of cultivating military service and is completely different from the nature of conscription. The department is now planning and preparing to carry it out. However, the jurisdiction of the National Guard is also the responsibility of the Military Region Command. At present, the barracks of the department have not yet been selected, so the National Guard training is temporarily difficult to promote. The department plans to set up a military affairs section to handle the National Guard training. The person in charge must be a military expert who has received advanced military training. The candidates have not yet been determined. As for the preliminary work of training the National Guard, we will first start by surveying robust men. It is estimated that there are more than 1.4 million citizens in this city who are of the age of qualified robust men. All qualified robust men have the obligation to receive National Guard training. As for the starting time of the training work, it still needs to be summoned by the order of the Military Region Command. However, the difficulty is the difficulty in solving the training venue (i.e., the barracks), and the budget also needs to be reviewed and decided by the Municipal Council.

It is also learned that the training class for the Baojia personnel planned by the department was originally suspected of using the Zhengshi Middle School building. Now, as the school is preparing for the enrollment and opening of the next semester, the location of the class has become a problem and is currently in a high tide.

Unlicensed Automobiles: Strict Enforcement

Recently, unlicensed automobiles have often been seen traveling on the streets of the city. These vehicles were purchased from abroad and may only have foreign licenses or have already obtained domestic licenses, but the foreign licenses have not been removed. In addition to urging the traffic police to pay more attention, the Public Utilities Bureau specifically requests the public's assistance. If you encounter an automobile without a domestic license, immediately notify the nearby traffic police to stop it.

### Rickshaw Pullers Detained as Suspects in Murder of Nanny

Jiang Yaocai, owner of a paper shop at No. 14, Lane 68, was the employer of the murdered Li Ma. The nanny Li Ma was found dead on the morning of the 11th of this month. The Taishan Police Precinct dispatched Zhang Jiayu and police officer Wang Dongwan to the scene to investigate. Two suspects, Dong A'chu and Sun A'er, have been detained in connection with the case. The deceased, Li Gao A'bao, 26 years old, from Gaoyou, Jiangbei, married Li Sang, also known as Youde, four years ago in their hometown. The couple came to Shanghai last May. Youde, now residing at No. 419, Yangzhou Road, is unemployed. Due to disagreements with the deceased, the deceased left home and worked as a nanny at Zhengtai Coal Company at the southern end of Jianguo East Road. Later, because of improper behavior, the deceased was dismissed. In December of last year, she was introduced by Sun A'er, a rickshaw puller for Dr. Huang Peixin at No. 38, Shuxiang Lane, Xinping Lane, Shunchang Road, to work as a nanny for the Jiang family.

After the murder, the Taishan Police Precinct dispatched officers to the Jiang family to investigate. They found that the deceased had indeed been strangled to death with a hemp rope. 188,700 legal tender, a pair of gold earrings, and a note with the words "Tong A'fu telephone 81216" were found in the deceased's pocket. There were no other clues to be found. The deceased slept every night in a small room under the staircase behind the living room. The doors in the front and back were tightly locked, so it was speculated that the murder took place late at night. According to Chai Huanchu, a resident of No. 15 next door, at around 7 PM, a man in his twenties wearing a felt hat and a yellow raincoat lightly knocked on the back door of No. 14 with his left index finger. When no one opened the door, he left. At around 8 PM, another man with short black hair and wearing a black short-sleeved shirt and pants was seen talking to the deceased.

The telephone number 81216 was traced to Bi Liangcai at No. 3, Lane 45, Taicang Road. When questioned, it was found that a rickshaw puller named Dong A'chu was out and had not returned home. Later, he was apprehended in front of the Huanqiu Dyeing and Weaving Factory on the road to the South City Police Department. Dong A'chu, 34 years old, from Gaoyou, stated that he knew the deceased through the introduction of Zhang A'bao, the nanny of Huang Jinpei's family. He had visited the Jiang family about four times, but vehemently denied having any improper relations with the deceased. He also went to the Jiang family at 8 PM on the 11th to ask if A'bao's new cotton robe had been made, and then left. He returned home to sleep at 11 PM and claimed to have no knowledge of the cause of the deceased's death. The original introducer, Sun A'er, 27 years old, from Gaoyou, residing at No. 3, Kangti Lane, Jianguo East Road, stated that he had known the deceased for some time and had visited her six times to inquire about her husband's whereabouts. He also went there at 7 PM on the 11th and left soon after to pull his rickshaw, returning home at 7:30 PM in the evening. He denied having any affair with the deceased and also did not know the cause of her death. The case was transferred to the prosecutor's office for further investigation yesterday.

### Garbage Trucks Transporting Vegetables: Health Bureau Actively Cracks Down, 16th Wharf Dispatches Investigators

[Our Newspaper] Regarding the matter of sanitation workers using garbage trucks to transport vegetables for profit, the Health Bureau has recently been actively investigating. Director Zhang and Director Qi of the Environmental Sanitation Department of the Health Bureau have been personally going to the vegetable markets around 16th Wharf at 3 AM every day to check for garbage trucks carrying vegetables. It is reported that one case was found some days ago, and the driver's license was revoked. The practice has reportedly disappeared in recent days, but the Health Bureau will continue to dispatch personnel to 16th Wharf for investigation to thoroughly eliminate it.

The practice of garbage trucks carrying vegetables stems from the poor living conditions of sanitation workers, who want to use public vehicles to profit. Director Qi told reporters yesterday that the basic salary of sanitation workers in the city is 35 yuan, which, multiplied by the civil servant's price index of 1,100 times, is approximately 38,500 yuan, plus a subsidy of 102,000 yuan, for a total monthly income of only 140,500 yuan.

The court ordered a retrial at a later date and remanded the defendant in custody.

### Cigarette Factory Postpones Year-End Bonus, Workers Destroy Office

[Our Newspaper] The Luxin Cigarette Factory at No. 1, Lane 124, Jianguo East Road, has over 800 male and female workers. Due to the large-scale dumping of American cigarettes, the factory's operations have been affected, and it is experiencing financial difficulties, so the workers' monthly wages are often not paid on time.

After mediation by the Social Bureau, the factory agreed to pay the bonus on the 15th, but it was postponed for two days. Then, on the 17th, it was said that it would be postponed again until noon on the 18th, and a notice was posted stating that if the bonus was not paid by that time, the factory would not be responsible for any accidents that occurred to the workers. This notice was jointly certified by Secretary Fan of the factory, Section Chief Bao of the Taishan Police Precinct's Judicial Section, and Mr. Sha of the Social Bureau. When noon arrived yesterday, the factory still had not paid the bonus, so the workers partially destroyed the office. The factory then reported to the Social Bureau, accusing the workers of damaging property and intending to cancel the year-end bonus. The workers refused, so they requested the Social Bureau to mediate again. Because the factory representative did not arrive, the discussion was postponed until today.

### Four Workers Arrested for Demanding Year-End Bonus at Sanxing Flour Mill

[Our Newspaper] The Sanxing Flour Mill in the city has been transferred to new owners because the factory owner did not intend to continue operating it. The outer-class workers (those who transport flour on the docks) recently demanded maintenance fees and a year-end bonus from the factory. The factory refused, and the Social Bureau was asked to mediate. The Social Bureau ruled that the outer-class workers were not formal employees of the factory and therefore were not entitled to payment. Yesterday morning at 11 AM, 47 of the outer-class workers, along with the former factory owner, went to the Social Bureau and surrounded the Third Division, shouting and making a scene for three hours. Until 2 PM, the Taishan Police Precinct sent police to the scene and arrested foreman Yang Chunqing and workers Meng Dekuan, Ling Yuanqing, and Qian Zeyi. The rest scattered.

### Wulan Ting Critically Ill; Unable to Eat, Abdomen Swollen Like a Drum; Life Sustained by Plasma and Saline Solution Alone

[Report from this newspaper] Wulan Ting, who was released from prison on bail due to illness and is receiving treatment at the Red Cross Hospital on Haige Road, has been unable to eat for the past two months due to intestinal obstruction, and his abdomen is swollen like a drum. His aged body is suffering greatly, and his condition has worsened. Mr. Wulan is staying in Room 18 of the hospital, under the exclusive care of nurse Zhang Jizhen. The hospital has repeatedly performed gastric lavage and administered plasma and saline solution over the past two days. When a reporter visited at 3:00 PM yesterday, the intravenous tube was still inserted in Mr. Wulan's mouth, and he was receiving the infusion. Mr. Wulan is unable to speak, has only a weak breath, his temperature fluctuates, and his pulse is also irregular. He has only drunk a small amount of Qiaozishui and chicken soup in the hospital for several days. The hospital firmly refuses family visits to avoid upsetting the patient. According to Dr. Chen Xixian of the hospital: Mr. Wulan is currently suffering from a gastrointestinal disorder or a malignant blood disease. Due to his old age and weakness, X-ray fluoroscopy cannot be used, making it difficult to determine the true nature of his condition. The plasma and saline solution being administered are emergency measures. When the reporter left the hospital, Dr. Chen added that Mr. Wulan's condition has reached a critical stage.

### Wu Suiren Tried Yesterday; Arrived in Court Ill and Expressed Deep Remorse

[Report from this newspaper] Wu Suiren, the former chief of the accounting section of the General Affairs Office of the Executive Yuan, abused his power to misappropriate 2.7 billion yuan of public funds for speculative profit. After the case was discovered, the District Prosecutor's Office detained Wu. After the prosecutor's investigation concluded, he was indicted on charges of directly or indirectly seeking profit from matters under his supervision or management, in accordance with Article 3, Section 6 of the Statute for the Punishment of Embezzlement. The case was initially tried at the District Court yesterday at 3:15 PM. After Judge Shao Renjie and the court clerk took their seats, the defendant Wu Suiren was brought in by bailiffs from the waiting room. Wu looked haggard and thin, wearing a gray Russian hat and a dark gray long cotton robe. His hands were trembling, indicating that he was indeed ill. Wu stated that he was 48 years old, from Anhui Province. He returned to Shanghai from Chongqing in May of the 34th year of the Republic (1945) and took the position of chief of the accounting section in August, responsible for staff salaries, remittances, and other matters. His official rank was originally recommended Grade 1, later changed to appointed. As for the huge sum of 2.7 billion yuan, it was a reimbursement from the Ministry of Finance for salaries paid in advance to the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) for September. It was remitted to the Central Bank in this city, and he alone collected it and transferred it to the account of the accounting section of the Executive Yuan at the Central Trust Bureau. When the funds arrived in Shanghai, he did not report it to his superiors and successively used 1.7 billion yuan, which was divided into batches and lent to two friends, Wu and Zhou, at interest rates ranging from 14% to 9%. After the incident, he returned all the principal and interest to the Executive Yuan and reported it orally and in writing to the Director and Secretary-General and admitted his guilt. He stated that the matter was purely a momentary mistake and asked the court for forgiveness, expressing deep remorse. Witness Wu Hongan testified that he had borrowed money from Wu Suiren, but only knew that the money belonged to Wu's friend and did not know it was public funds from the Executive Yuan. After the hearing concluded, the defendant's defense lawyer requested the court to grant bail, arguing that the defendant was suffering from illness due to malnutrition in prison. The court ordered that the case be rescheduled for further hearing, and that the defendant could receive medical treatment in prison. The request for bail was rejected, and Wu Suiren was returned to custody.

### Social Services: Shanghai Branch of the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration Entrusts This Column to Distribute Winter Clothing

Those who are extremely poor, unemployed, elderly, weak, or disabled are encouraged to apply promptly.

This column has recently been entrusted by the Shanghai Branch of the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (RRA) to distribute several hundred sets of winter clothing. At this time of severe cold, there are many impoverished and distressed people. The number of hidden poor is countless. Compassion is innate in everyone. Therefore, the staff of this column believes that the distribution of winter clothing is urgent. We hope that readers will inform the elderly, weak, disabled, and orphaned children to apply promptly in accordance with the regulations to receive the clothing. The letter from the Shanghai Branch of the RRA and the distribution guidelines are recorded below:

"To the Editor: In order to widely distribute winter clothing, this branch previously sent a letter requesting your newspaper to assist in the distribution. We now understand that you have inquired about the distribution method and should follow the instructions. Therefore, we are enclosing a copy of the simplified rules for your reference. Sincerely, Shanghai Branch of the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, January 17."

[Simplified Rules for Distributing Winter Clothing] (1) The winter clothing produced and distributed by this branch is limited to those who are extremely poor, unemployed, and in genuine need, with priority given to the elderly, weak, disabled, and orphaned children. (2) Needy students in schools will be distributed by the Student Relief Association. Homeless people on the streets will be taken in and distributed by the Winter Relief Association's shelters. Refugees in transit will be distributed directly by this branch. These are not included in the distribution by various delegated organizations. (3) When distributing winter clothing, delegated organizations should limit distribution to those residing in nearby areas and who have been verified to be in need. (4) When receiving winter clothing, recipients should present their citizen identification card, household registration certificate, or other proof of identification, and should provide a receipt. (5) After distributing winter clothing, delegated organizations should clearly state the recipient's circumstances of poverty and detailed address on the receipt. (6) The winter clothing produced and distributed by this branch this year is for use in this winter. Delegated organizations should make every effort to distribute them as early as possible so that they are timely and submit all receipts to this branch for record-keeping after distribution is complete. (7) The number of winter clothing produced and distributed by this branch is limited, so priority should be given to applications in the order they are received. If there are too many applications, the most urgent cases should be selected for distribution, or applications can be made to other delegated organizations. If the number of people is small, efforts should be made to borrow from other organizations.

### Thrift and Poverty Relief

Yesterday, a certain lady donated 120,000 yuan in legal tender (i.e., the anonymous donor in the donation report) to be used as relief funds for the Qíngxiá orphans, widows, and the poor. According to the lady, the funds were the proceeds from the Christmas celebrations of her and her sibling last year. Feeling compassion for the general orphans, widows, the elderly and weak, who are struggling in poverty, she decided to donate the money to charity. The lady's thrift and poverty relief are commendable. It is hoped that enthusiastic people in society will respond and provide a lifeline for the poor!

To Mr. Feng Shuhua: There is an important letter written from another city and entrusted for you to transfer. Please provide your address so that it can be delivered. (Editor)

### Strong Buyer Demand: Gold Prices Rise Again After Suppression

Despite pressure from the Central Bank yesterday, the overwhelming demand from buyers caused gold prices to continue to rise. The market opened slightly higher at 3.73 million, but there was still resistance above 3.75 million. At 10:00 AM, the Central Bank allocated 270 bars at a price of 3.75 million. Afterwards, new buyer demand was very strong, and the Central Bank temporarily adopted a wait-and-see attitude. Eventually, the price broke through the 3.8 million mark, reaching a high of 3.84 million. The Central Bank sold again at the high price, which caused a brief struggle and a drop back to 3.76 million. However, due to continued demand in the actual sales market, the price rebounded to 3.81 million at noon. In the afternoon, there was little change due to it being Saturday, and the quoted price remained around 3.82 million, an increase of 125,000 compared to the previous close. Silver dollars rose sharply by 10%. Due to the year-end season, actual sales were brisk, and the informal interest rate on silver tightened, ranging from 15% to 20%.

Foreign currencies were lackluster. The support from the gold market slightly boosted the value of U.S. dollars in the informal market, which initially traded around 6,400. Later, due to the increase in gold prices, it rose to 6,600 yuan at noon. In the afternoon, there was little change due to it being Saturday. The result was an increase of 150 yuan compared to the previous close. Hong Kong dollars remained stagnant. The exchange rate for Hong Kong dollars rose to 1,230 yuan and 1,250 yuan yesterday. The exchange rate for Indian rupees was 1,500 yuan to 1,520 yuan, and the exchange rate for British pounds was 19,700 yuan to 19,800 yuan. Only Hong Kong dollars saw some trading activity, while the others had quoted prices but no actual transactions.

### Increased Premium for Over-the-Counter Trading; Chinese Stocks Gradually Rise

Yesterday, the 11th installment of Chinese stocks was traded. The market was very volatile, initially low and then high. The swap premium was the same, initially falling to 22 yuan due to selling by Financial Helper and Xingye, with a daily interest rate of only 12%. Later, due to the appearance of large over-the-counter traders, the interest rate soared to as much as 28%. Delivery of Yung Shing Yarn increased considerably. Various small stocks all rose under the absorption of scattered speculative funds. The market opened low in the morning. During the session, both long and short positions swapped positions, and the long positions were more active. Stocks like 231, 224, 196, 16, 22, and 226 were all absorbed, and the swap premium decreased, rising to 767 yuan for delivery and 740 yuan for spot. Stock 14 was supplied when it went down, and stocks 97, 16, 152, 172, and 196 also sold Yung Shing Yarn, once falling back to the opening price. Stocks 198, 76, 145, 20, 186, and 78 all increased. As the gold market trended higher, the premium for over-the-counter trading increased, gradually rising to a high of 750 yuan for immediate delivery and 790 yuan for delivery. Stock 145, 129, and 30 sold spot Yung Shing Yarn, which slightly lowered the price. The market turned sideways near noon, and closed slightly higher. The arbitrage premium also gradually rose to a premium of 37 yuan for Yung Shing Yarn and 10 yuan for Sino-British. The demand for various small stocks was urgent, and they all ended at high prices. The result was a slight increase in Yung Shing Yarn, Mei Ya, and Hua Feng, and a slight decrease in Sino-British. Jingfu and Qin Xing rose by more than 50%, and Xin Guang rose by 8%, which was the most eye-catching. The cold stock Yung Gong rose by 50%. Other stocks saw both increases and decreases. Among the delivery stocks, Yung Shing Yarn, Mei Ya, Qin Xing, and Hua Feng rose slightly, Xin Guang rose by slightly less than 10%, and Sino-British rose by slightly less than 50%. In the over-the-counter market, except for Da Sheng, which continued to advance, the rest of the stocks saw both increases and decreases.

Foreign stocks were traded for only one hour yesterday. After 11:00 AM, trading was suspended due to auditing. The stocks saw varying increases and decreases. The result was a slight increase or decrease in each stock compared to the previous close.

### Bond Market Stagnant

The bond market was even more stagnant yesterday, with very little trading. Unified Bond C opened at 2,000 yuan, with a high of 2,130 yuan and a low of 1,980 yuan. It ultimately fluctuated between 2,100 yuan and 2,150 yuan. The result was a slight decrease of 20 yuan for Type A and B bonds compared to the previous close, and an increase of 50 yuan for Type C bonds. Types D and E remained flat.

### Yarn, Cloth, and Rayon Markets to Close Tomorrow; Reopen on the Sixth Day of the New Year

Recently, due to the Lunar New Year closing of accounts, trading in the city's industries and commerce has gradually stagnated. Even when there is a market, there is very little activity. It is reported that starting next week, markets for commodities such as yarn, cloth, rayon, and cotton have all announced closures. The reopening of business for various industries will be delayed until the 27th of this month (the sixth day of the Lunar New Year) because the fifth day of the New Year falls on a Sunday.

### Meeting Year-End Cooking Oil Needs: China National Plant Oil Factory Distributes as Much as Possible

In order to solve the year-end cooking oil needs of the city, Mayor Wu specially summoned Li Tingdong, manager of the state-owned China National Plant Oil Factory, and Zhang Decheng, the factory director, yesterday morning, instructing them to be responsible for the supply of cooking oil in the city during the year-end season. The factory has agreed to maintain the supply, but has requested two things: (1) a relaxation of the electricity supply in order to increase production, and (2) the provision of working capital. Mayor Wu has agreed to find a solution. According to Manager Li, there is no need to worry about a shortage of cooking oil in the city during the year-end season, and the factory will distribute as much as possible.

### Cigarette Prices Soar: Increase by One-Third

As the end of the year approaches, and the new Lunar New Year's Day is imminent, cigarette sales have skyrocketed. Due to strong demand from vendors in various regions and absorption by local small-scale hoarders, prices have soared by one-third since yesterday morning, a rare phenomenon in history. The highest price was for Great Britain cigarettes, with the wholesale price once reaching 2.2 million. British American Tobacco cigarettes also saw a significant increase in price. Retail shops and stalls have all changed their labels and revised their prices. For example, a pack of 20 white-tin cigarettes, which originally sold for 2,500 yuan, was selling for 3,500 yuan a pack yesterday afternoon. A pack of 10 Old Knife cigarettes, which originally sold for 300 to 350 yuan, was selling for 400 to 450 yuan. Top-of-the-line cigarettes were even more popular. This is all due to the fact that the Lunar New Year is approaching, businesses are preparing for holidays, and retailers are taking the opportunity to raise prices in order to profit. According to industry insiders, this phenomenon is due to the squeezed production of cigarette factories. This situation will reverse after the first five days of the new year.

### Banks' Foreign Currency Deposit Accounts May Not Withdraw Foreign Currency

The reporter recently learned from the Foreign Exchange Examination Department of the Central Bank that, in order to strengthen the management of foreign exchange, the department recently notified all designated foreign exchange banks that foreign currency may not be withdrawn from foreign currency deposit accounts, nor may they be transferred between accounts. Furthermore, the circumstances of withdrawals from foreign currency accounts must be reported to the Foreign Exchange Examination Department at any time.

### Import and Export Association Establishes Subcommittees; Central Bank Explains Settlement Procedures

[Report from this newspaper] The Shanghai Import and Export Association held a board meeting yesterday afternoon, passing resolutions to establish four committees: a Mediation Committee, an International Trade Committee, a Industry Regulation Research Committee, and a Tax Research Committee, and deciding on the following: (1) The members of each committee will be nominated by the board of directors of the association from among the member representatives, and will be appointed upon deliberation. (2) The board of directors may appoint members or non-members, experts, or experienced persons as committee members or guiding advisors.

Furthermore, the Central Bank Foreign Exchange Examination Department responded to the Import and Export Association's inquiry on the issues of settlement and letters of credit, stating: "Upon investigation, if an importer is unable to ship goods due to strikes, suspension of shipping, or other difficulties, and applies to this department through a designated bank to extend the letter of credit for the purchase of goods, this department will take into account the actual circumstances and grant as much leeway as possible, in line with the purpose of developing international trade and supporting legitimate business. However, the extension of the letter of credit and the issuance of the import permit are two separate matters. It cannot be said that the letter of credit can be extended simply because a permit has been obtained. Furthermore, the established practice for issuing letters of credit cannot be changed and has been in place for a long time, and there appears to be no need to change it at present. As for settlement procedures, the procedures stipulated in the circular from the association can be followed."

### Woolen Fabric Market Stalls

Yesterday, Saturday, was also the 27th day of the old lunar month, and the woolen fabric market was mostly stalled. Except for retail stores, there were almost no wholesale transactions. Both buyers and sellers were busy settling accounts, preparing to get through the year-end and welcome the New Year, and then resume business after the reopening. Opinions on the future market vary. According to industry insiders, if the exchange rate does not change and the gold price remains stable, there should be no significant increases or decreases in woolen fabric prices.

### Banks' Cash Position Loosens; Year-End Can Be Passed Stably

[Report from this newspaper] According to financial sources: the Lunar New Year is fast approaching. The cash position management of various banks and money houses has generally come to an end. In order to solidify their own strength, all banks and money houses are actively recovering loans that have been issued in order to prepare for lending plans after the Lunar New Year reopening. For this reason, the cash position within the financial industry has been quite loose recently. According to the results of the check clearing house yesterday, the four major banks and two bureaus cleared more than 10 billion yuan for various banks and money houses. Therefore, judging from recent trends, the financial industry is expected to pass the year-end stably. However, most general businesses, except those that have obtained production loans from the authorities in advance, feel that their cash position is tight, which is due to the banks and money houses recovering old debts. The cash position is expected to loosen after the reopening.

### Rice Market Sales Improve; Grain Transactions Scarce

4,890 shi of rice arrived from both the North and the South. As the end of the year approaches, both large households and small families need to prepare grain for the New Year, so sales have improved. Shops are actively stocking up, creating a situation where demand exceeds supply. Northern and Southern Japonica rice prices continue to rise by 2,000 yuan. White Yuan rice prices are stable, while Yin Yuan rice prices fluctuate, with an increase of 1,000 yuan. Indica rice is still traded little. Grain transactions are scarce. There are not many sellers of raw oil, and stock is also not selling well. Refined oil remains unchanged, but sesame oil is gradually declining, continuing to fall by 4,000 yuan. Soybean cake prices continue to rise by 100-200 yuan due to activity by visiting vendors. Wheat bran is stable, and flour remains lackluster, remaining fair. Red bean prices are brisk, rising sharply by 3,000-4,000 yuan. Tea beans are stable, raw peanuts are strong, and peanuts are tight. Other grains have not yet opened for trading. The market officially closes today and will be closed from tomorrow until the 27th of January, Monday, when trading will resume as usual.

### If a Cotton Mill's Cotton Inventory Is Less Than Two Months, An Emergency Application Can Be Made, But The Application Quantity Cannot Exceed Three Months

[Report from this newspaper] The Foreign Cotton Allocation Committee of the Transportation and Control Board held its second meeting at the Central Bank yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM. Committee members present included Chairman Li Gan, Wu Weijing, Rong Yixin, Wang Qiyu, Guo Dihuo, Tang Xinghai, Zhang Silu, and Liu Wenteng, director of the Textile Control Board's Business Department. Chairman Li Gan presided over the meeting, which adjourned at 6:30 PM. There were three important motions: (1) to approve the draft organizational charter of the Foreign Cotton Allocation Committee; (2) to discuss the cotton inventory statistics reported by the various cotton mills. However, the figures reported by various parties were quite inconsistent. Although they were cross-referenced for a long time, the task was not completed, so the entire allocation plan was not discussed; (3) If a factory's cotton inventory is less than two months, it can apply to purchase foreign cotton in advance. However, the application quantity cannot exceed three months. The Cotton Industry Association of the Sixth District is requested to notify its members to investigate. Those with less than two months of cotton inventory can make an emergency application. The Allocation Committee will discuss and approve the matter at the next meeting.

### Yarn Market Sales Are Quite Brisk

Yesterday was the end of the yarn market. Visiting vendors took advantage of the cheap prices to buy, creating a buying frenzy. As a result, 20-count yarn continued to rise by 20,000 to 80,000, with the heaviest weight goods seeing the largest increase due to activity by vendors from South China. Ordinary light-weight 20-count yarn also rose by 20,000-30,000. Visiting vendors from inland areas have absorbed a significant amount. Fine yarn and double-ply yarn have not seen much fluctuation. People's minds are stable. It is reported that the cash positions of various yarn companies have been arranged, and they will pass the year-end stably.

### Sugar Import and Export Continuous

Foreign Sugar Also Arrives, 50,000 Bags

[Our Newspaper] Sugar imports continue unabated. In addition to shipments from Guangdong and Taiwan, foreign sugar has now arrived. The "Dureen" (transliteration) vessel, managed by Jardine Matheson, arrived in Shanghai from Vancouver, carrying a large quantity of timber and 51,980 bags of foreign sugar. It arrived in Shanghai yesterday evening and is currently docked at the Gonghexiang Wharf for unloading. Furthermore, a considerable amount of sugar has recently been shipped to Tianjin. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's "Haihan" vessel sailed north yesterday afternoon, carrying an estimated 3,200 bags of sugar, over 160 boxes of tea, more than 590 pieces of piece goods, and over 180 pieces of cotton yarn to Tianjin.

### Export Tax Levied on Indian Tea

### Price of Japanese Silk Cocoons Still Uncertain; Tax on Shipments to China Awaits Confirmation

According to a representative of the China Sericulture Corporation, the company received an order from the Executive Yuan sometime last week regarding the shipment of Japanese silk cocoons to China. Allied forces could ship one million pounds of Japanese silk cocoons to China at a price of US$2.75 per pound. The company immediately calculated the cost of reeling based on a conversion rate of 400 catties, plus various expenses, estimating the cost of producing one pound of raw silk at over US$8. However, given that the highest price for Chinese silk in the current US market is only US$7 per pound, the company immediately countered with a price of US$2.50 per pound. A response has not yet been received, and it is difficult to predict whether Allied Headquarters will agree. Rumors of the imminent arrival of Japanese silk cocoons in China remain to be confirmed.

### Soap Prices Hit New High; Many Daily Necessities Are Rising

In recent days, various industries have been frequently closing down in anticipation of the upcoming New Year's Eve. The soap and daily necessities trade has been the most bustling. Yesterday morning, "Guben" brand soap once rose to 120,000 yuan per case, with retail prices reaching 2,000 yuan per bar. Other brands have also risen in price due to eager buying. Prices eased slightly in the afternoon, with prices quoted this morning at 100,500 yuan, and scissors at 100,200 yuan. Soap factories are reluctant to release actual goods due to excessive losses. New factory stocks will not be available for another week or two. Some soap factories have already closed for the New Year holiday, while others are working day and night to meet market demand and recoup raw material costs. Other daily necessities, such as cigarettes and matches, are also experiencing significant price increases. Businesses specializing in Southern goods are thriving, and fabric stores will be closing for the holiday within a day or two. Department stores and food businesses are gearing up for the three days before the end of the year, traditionally their busiest period. Some fashion companies, however, are experiencing a slowdown and are making every effort to attract customers. Jewelry stores are crowded with customers and struggling to keep up with demand. Some jewelry stores are staying open at night to satisfy the public's gold-buying frenzy.

Further reports indicate that soap prices are rising in a straight line. According to industry insiders, the main raw materials for soap, such as caustic soda and soda ash, are in short supply in the city, and foreign imports are delayed due to the need for permits. While Imperial Chemical Industries has recently shipped over a thousand barrels to Shanghai, import permits have been slow to arrive, preventing the goods from being released to the market. Two months ago, caustic soda was still priced at 600,000 yuan per barrel, but it has now skyrocketed to 3,000,000 yuan. Domestic production of tallow is insufficient, and before the war, China relied on Australia for supplies, but no shipments are currently arriving. As a result, the price of tallow per dan (approximately 50 kilograms) has risen from 100,000 yuan two months ago to the current price of 200,000 yuan. The situation with coconut oil is relatively good. However, soap prices were unusually low one or two months ago. Manufacturers produced soap from high-priced raw materials and sold it at low prices, incurring significant losses, which led to a general reduction in production. Although market prices are now rising steadily, raw material costs are increasing even faster, so production is still not profitable. Furthermore, factory stock prices are only about 80% of the market price. It is reported that there are currently over 40 soap manufacturers in Shanghai, with varying business scopes. Some manufacturers have already closed down due to losses, and most of those remaining have reduced their operations. The average operating rate of manufacturers is only about 50%. If all factories were operating at full capacity, their output would be sufficient to meet market demand. It is rumored that the industry is considering new factory stocks, which should become clear in a week or two.

### Central Government Fully Supports the Future Production and Sales of Fujian Tea

[Our Newspaper, Fuzhou] Fujian tea has always sold well in domestic and foreign markets and occupies an extremely important position in international trade. Recently, due to the impact of foreign exchange and transportation, sales have stagnated, and Fujian tea merchants suffered significant losses last year. At the same time, the government and the Chenmin Bank failed to provide tea loans in a timely manner, and tea farmers, lacking funds, sharply reduced production, and the quality deteriorated. The tea industry, which had always been an important specialty product of Fujian Province, has steadily declined. It is now learned that the Ministry of Economic Affairs is preparing a tea industry revival plan for the 36th year of the Republic (1947) and is greatly concerned about the production, sales, manufacturing methods, and organization of tea cooperatives in Fujian. It will provide financial and technical assistance to the development of Fujian tea to promote export trade.

### Small Statistics on Production Loans

Over 40 Billion Already Approved; Approximately 200 Factories

[Our Newspaper] It is reported that since the Provisional Review Committee for Production Business Loans of the Joint Treasury of Four Banks began its work, it has approved a total loan amount of over 43 billion yuan, benefiting approximately 200 factories.

### Gasoline Supply Still Not Normal

The supply of gasoline in Shanghai has not improved as the import procedures for the tankers of the three major gasoline companies have not yet been completed, and the Jianghai Customs has prohibited their import, causing a gasoline panic. As of yesterday, the situation had not yet improved. Some gas stations in the central district experienced queues, and the amount of gasoline per vehicle was temporarily limited to three gallons, priced at 5,900 yuan. According to sources at Asiatic Petroleum Company, import procedures should be completed within days, so this situation should be resolved soon. As for rumors of an imminent increase in gasoline prices, the company has denied them.

### Central Bank to Organize a Silk Weaving Industry Export Committee

In order to rescue the silk weaving and satin factories from their economic crisis, the Central Bank plans to organize a special silk weaving industry export committee, which will be formally established after the Lunar New Year. At the same time, the Shanghai Silk Industry Association has established a silk joint venture company to cooperate with the above policies. The special committee will purchase dried cocoons and hand them over to the joint venture company to weave silk, which will then be returned to the special committee for unified export. The special committee will provide direct loans to silk factories to facilitate the turnover of funds.

### Production of Flour Mills in Shanghai Greatly Reduced

In recent months, only five major flour mills in Shanghai, including Fuxin, Zaofeng, Huafeng, Weixin, and Futong, have been operating normally. The remaining smaller mills are temporarily closed. It was learned yesterday that the total flour production in Shanghai was 1,213,640 bags in October last year, which decreased to 494,310 bags in November, and further decreased to 214,497 bags in December (last month), only one-sixth of the October production. The main reasons for the decrease in production are as follows: (1) insufficient supply of wheat raw materials, foreign wheat has not yet arrived, and the cost of domestic wheat is high, which prevents increased production; (2) prices were not adjusted in the past two months, making it difficult for manufacturers to profit, thus reducing production; (3) production is affected by electricity restrictions. Due to the above reasons, production has decreased every month. However, the negotiated price of flour has recently increased from 20,000 yuan to 25,000 yuan, and all mills are preparing to increase production. It is expected that production will increase after the Lunar New Year.

### Tea Market Deteriorating

Recently, the tea market has become increasingly quiet as the end of the year approaches and some export companies are still rushing to ship "Chou Zhen Zhen Mei" and other green teas to French Africa. Inquiries have plummeted, transactions have been declining, and the trend is particularly bleak. According to industry insiders, the French company Shui Xing Foreign Firm is still actively negotiating overseas for bulk Chinese tea. If these negotiations proceed smoothly, there may be considerable exports after the Lunar New Year. As for various types of tea for domestic sales, the trend remains very sluggish.

### US Automobile Industry Hopes to Abolish Restrictions

[Reuters, New York, 16th] The US automobile industry hopes that export restrictions, even if they cannot be completely abolished, should be eased. An industry spokesman pointed out that, in order to compete in the markets outside customs barriers, British truck and freight car manufacturers are exporting half of their passenger car production and one-third of their commercial vehicle production. It is also believed that French manufacturers are exporting 70% of their truck production. The export figures for the British automobile industry in 1946 were quite favorable, with 135,000 passenger cars, 190,000 freight cars, and a number of other commercial vehicles being sold in overseas markets. However, due to government controls, manufacturers are unable to export their trucks and freight cars in proportion to their production. These controls limit passenger car exports to 6.3% and truck exports to 20.4% of annual production. The highest number of vehicles manufactured in the US and shipped overseas was 451,095 passenger cars and 82,667 freight cars.

### Bank of China Announces Last Year's Remittances from Overseas Chinese: Amounts Decreasing Daily; Reason Lies in the Exchange Rate

[Our Newspaper] The Overseas Remittances Group of the International Department of the Bank of China completed the compilation of remittance figures from January to December of last year and listed them as follows: Month Amount (National Currency Yuan)

January 87,273,298

February 42,611,217

March 4,748,490,000

April 8,619,609,930

May 6,722,763,456

June 5,790,334,839

July 4,061,720,261

August 8,300,615

September 7,291,107,234

October 7,222,501,242

November 4,703,110,015

December 3,678,442

The figures for January and February are small because the official foreign exchange rate was not yet fixed and was still calculated at the previous rate of 20 yuan. If the full amount of subsidies is included, the original figures should be increased by a factor of 24. Starting in March, after the new exchange rate of 2020 was announced, remittances increased sharply, reaching their peak in April. After April, they gradually decreased. In August, when the exchange rate was changed to 3350, the figures increased slightly again. After August, the exchange rate did not change, but the black market for US dollars became increasingly active, so remittance figures decreased every month, falling to just over 3.6 billion yuan in December. In US dollar terms, the difference between December and April exceeded threefold. According to a person in charge of the Bank of China's International Department, this shocking difference is due to the evasion of remittances. According to past remittance figures, the monthly figures should not have significant differences, and the December figures are usually larger than the previous months. The fact that the December figures are the smallest and differ greatly from the previous months is noteworthy. The Bank of China has reviewed its own operations and found that its remittance processing speed is no less than that of foreign banks, so the reason for evading remittances is the large difference between the official and black market prices of US dollars. Remittances from overseas Chinese are mostly concentrated in Hong Kong. For example, the Bank of China's Rangoon branch was originally established to handle remittances, but in recent months, business has been slow, making it virtually useless. Currently, we have sent a senior official to Hong Kong to conduct a thorough investigation, and the results of the investigation will soon be clear.

### Provincial Banks in Shanghai to Establish a United Remittance Center

In order to facilitate inter-provincial remittances to major ports across the country, provincial banks nationwide, in accordance with the Ministry of Finance's instructions, will establish United Remittance Centers for National Provincial Banks in Shanghai, Tianjin, Hankou, Guangzhou, and other places. The United Remittance Center in Shanghai is being planned by the Standing Committee of the Provincial Banks in Shanghai. A symposium was held at the United Association of National Provincial Banks on Chengdu Road at 2:00 PM yesterday. More than a dozen people in charge of the Shanghai branches of the Guangdong Provincial Bank, the Hunan Provincial Bank, and the Jiangsu Farmers Bank attended. The meeting elected representatives from the Guangdong, Hunan, Zhejiang, and Jiangsu Farmers Banks to study and formulate the United Remittance Center's remittance methods and elected the Guangdong Provincial Bank as the convener.

### Upset in Basketball League: Hualian Loses to Chunmao Team by One Point: 38 to 39

[Reported by this newspaper] In the second Basketball League, an upset occurred last night in Group A1. The defending champion Hualian team had an unfavorable start, losing its first battle by a single point to the Chunmao team, a reincarnation of Huanan, with a score of 38 to 39. In the first half, Hualian led by two points with a score of 14 to 12. In Group A2, Huayang defeated Peier by a single point, 28 to 27. The Qinglian team defeated Qianghua in the women's group, 32 to 22. The battle report is divided as follows.

Women's Group Takes the Stage

In the first match, the Qianghua women's team faced the Qinglian team. Sun Fengzhu of Qinglian participated despite an injury, reducing her power. Qianghua put on a spirited performance. In the first quarter, Qinglian led by only one point, 5 to 4. In the second quarter, Cao Manli of Qianghua scored repeatedly, creating a tie at 10. Later, Sun Fengzhu and Liu Huishan of Qinglian each scored, and Qinglian led by 16 to 10 at halftime. After the break, Qinglian was exceptionally rampant. Little sister Xu Peizhen and Sun Fengzhu played skillfully. Qianghua eventually fell behind due to experience, and trailed 17 to 26 in the third quarter. In the final quarter, both sides were exhausted and scored little. As a result, Qinglian won with a score of 32 to 22, achieving a successful start.

The Fatty Wins

In the second act, Huayang of Group A fought Peier. One side was young and energetic, full of vigor, while the other side was large-bellied, like Mount Tai. The battle was very exciting. The fat gentlemen scored mostly with long-range shots into the empty basket. Three minutes after the whistle, neither side had scored. Sun Mingxin and Dong Zhongyi of Huayang scored from the midline, taking a 4 to 0 lead. Shen Beizhang of Peier scored with a shot and a free throw, and Hu Huizhao quickly broke through to score. Hu Huikai rose to chase, but Dong Zhongyi of Huayang made a wonderful empty-basket shot. At the end of the first half, Peier trailed by one and a half points, 15 to 18. After the break, Dong Zhongyi of Huayang scored two goals first. Shen Beizhang of Peier recovered four points, and the two sides fought fiercely for a long time, with Huayang leading by only one point, 24 to 25. When the Hu Huizhao and Hu Huikai brothers were successively fouled out of the game, their momentum was suddenly diminished. In the last four minutes, they trailed 28 to 24. Huayang, thinking there was not much time left, passed the ball around. When time ran out, the fat team overwhelmed Peier with a score of 28 to 27, by one point.

The Final Battle

In the final battle, Hualian fought Chunmao. The former was the champion of the previous season, while the latter was the entire team of Huanan, so the battle was quite exciting. Tang Baokun received the ball from the midline and sent it forward, and Ren Xiangcheng flew to support him. Then, Baokun scored with a long-range shot, giving Hualian a 4-0 lead. Chunmao hurriedly called a timeout to discuss a counterattack. Li Xianzheng made the first contribution, Huang Tianlie made two free throws, and Liu Shanfu scored with a long-range shot. After eight minutes, Chunmao took the lead with 8 to 5. Hualian was anxious, and Bao Songyuan and Chen Xuechong launched an attack, connecting consecutively. Chunmao called three timeouts, and at the end of the first half, they trailed Hualian by one goal, 12 to 14.

Hualian Suffers a Defeat

Switching sides and fighting again, Chunmao's offensive suddenly tightened. Li Xianzheng scored with a push and a free throw, and A Biao then scored. Although Bao Songyuan of Hualian recovered a point, Liu Shanfu scored two throws and one free throw, and Chunmao took the lead again with 22 to 16. Xiao Zhang of Hualian was absent-minded and missed both free throws. By the last four minutes, Hualian trailed 27 to 32. Hualian calmly responded, Xiao Zhang made a free throw and then scored with a long-range shot, and Ren Xiangcheng scored another point on a free throw, trailing by only one goal, 31 to 33. Bao Songyuan made one of two free throws, still trailing by one point. The situation was extremely tense. Li Zhen frowned tightly outside the field, unable to find a solution. Bao Songyuan pushed in again, and Zhang Liangxiong scored with a long-range shot. Hualian fought hard and took the lead again, but He Hanfu of Chunmao scored three consecutive points, settling the matter. Zhang Liangxiong scored with a long-range shot, but it was too late to save the situation. Chunmao defeated Hualian by one point, 39 to 38.

### Sugar and Insecticides: The Highest Production Record in Taichung

— Yang Yu, Our Correspondent in Taiwan

Air Mail on the 4th

A history of the sugar industry is enough to write about the vicissitudes of Taiwan. As the largest enterprise in Taiwan and even the Far East, it has been around for more than 300 years. From the Dutch occupation of Taiwan, through the rule of Zheng Chenggong and the Qing Dynasty, to the exploitation by the Japanese and the recovery of today, it has always kept the island with it, occupying a very important position in the economy of the Far East.

Under the colonial management of the Japanese, the sugar industry in Taiwan was regarded as a very important link and source of profit. They spared no effort to improve the sugar industry according to the suggestions of Dr. Nitobe, who was sent to various countries around the world to investigate the sugar industry. Many old-fashioned sugar mills and factories were sacrificed in this torrent, and were replaced by nine large-scale sugar monopoly companies established by the Japanese in Taiwan. They used new machinery to create the highest production record in the sugar industry in Taiwan.

Sugar Industry in Crisis, Full of Hardships

After an unprecedented war, Taiwan's sugar industry also took a sharp turn. After the restoration, the sugar company jointly operated by the Resources Committee and the Chief Executive's Office received many war-torn factories from the Japanese. To date, there are 37, some of which have been repaired and put into operation, while others have been too damaged and need to be reorganized for a period of time before they can be put into operation. Qian Changzhao, Chairman of the Resources Committee, recently came to Taiwan and gave a speech in the Senate, saying that the sugar production in the 36th year could be increased to 100,000 tons, and the output would be gradually increased to 1 million tons in three years. For the factory itself, it seems not impossible to achieve this goal, but looking at the land, there are many hardships in front of us.

During the Japanese rule, everything was for the benefit of their own country. By unscrupulous means, the sugar industry in Taiwan was like their source of life, and they did not let go of it at all. They forced farmers to grow sugarcane and controlled the price of rice, making it the same as the price of sugarcane. To put it nicely, on the one hand, they encouraged sugarcane planting, and on the other hand, they guaranteed prices. At the same time, they also used cheap rations of food and fertilizer as bait. Under this two-pronged policy, considerable results were naturally achieved, but now the farmers have to make such a calculation: the Japanese conscripted the manpower and food here during the war, and in order to have enough to eat, they had to plant more rice. Moreover, sugarcane can only be harvested once every 18 months, while rice can be harvested twice or even three times a year, and some beans, wheat, and miscellaneous grains can be planted in spare time. The landlords also think this way. Now the government seems to have a way to draw water from the bottom of the pot. Fertilizer, the main food of Taiwan's land, cannot be solved quickly. Although the sugar industry has received 50,000 tons of fertilizer from the 200,000 tons of fertilizer shipped from the Relief Administration, the quality is different, the quantity is not enough, and the distribution is very difficult.

Although agricultural loans are being organized, six installments are paid each year, but it was not until the fourth installment that the first installment could be paid with difficulty. The money for the Taiwan Sugar Company is taken from the Bank of Taiwan, but the budget of 600 million Taiwan dollars exceeds the amount issued by Taiwan, which is also a problem in terms of funding.

The conscription of food is also a major threat to sugarcane farmers, who have to buy rice at a high price to complete the payment. No wonder these hardships force them to complain every day.

Daily Output of More Than 2,000 Dan

The Taichung Sugar Factory is a soil factory belonging to the first branch of the Tainan Huwei Taiwan Sugar Company. Its predecessor was the "Imperial Sugar Manufacturing Co., Ltd.". This word has been eroded on the towering chimney and is almost impossible to distinguish. During the war, three bombs were dropped here, but fortunately, they did not hit the key points. Therefore, after officially taking over on May 1 this year, the liquor and sugar factory was quickly repaired. As for the sugar manufacturing factory, because it is still far from the start-up period in February next year, it is now cleaning the sugar residue that has condensed in the pipes of the machine. Hundreds of pipes have to be dismantled and inspected one by one, which is quite troublesome. Zhao Zhenyao, the director of the factory, told reporters that there are more than 450 employees, most of whom are now in the factory. Once the sugarcane harvest starts, the highest sugar-making efficiency can be exerted immediately. However, the biggest reason is that farmers are unwilling to grow sugarcane and there is a lack of fertilizer. Taking the output from the 34th to 35th years of the Republic of China as an example, the area of the farmland of the Zhong Sugar Factory was only more than 13,700 mu (originally, the farmland and sugarcane crops were everywhere, and the raw material area had a total area of nearly 450,000 mu, but the end of the war also brought misfortune here). The sugar production was about 60,000 catties per Jia. Although there are now about 30,000 mu of land, the sugarcane is pitifully thin. In previous years, sugar could be produced for four months, but now I am afraid that it will not be produced for even a month. As for whether the output can reach the previous output of more than 13,700 mu, it is still a question!

The equipment of the factory is quite complete, and the mechanical crushing capacity of sugarcane is 1,500 tons per day, and more than 2,000 dan of sugar can be produced every day. In this way, the government seems to have to quickly come up with a countermeasure to make the sugarcane in the fields live up to these high mechanical capabilities.

Complicated Procedures for Three Kinds of Sugar

Although it has not yet started, the reporter was still led to tour the factory under repair and they told me the step-by-step sugar-making procedures. After the sugarcane is harvested, it can be transported directly from the farm to the factory by the factory's train, weighed, and then unloaded by the unloader to the sugarcane conveyor. There are two sets of rolling knives on the top of the conveyor, which can cut the sugarcane, and then crush it and input it into the converging press. After being pressed by four sets of presses, the obtained sugarcane dregs are sent to the boiler room for fuel, and a part of it can be pressed to make pulp. Now, most of the ceilings in Taiwanese homes are sugarcane boards made of this pulp. The obtained sugarcane juice is pumped into a heated device to increase the temperature to 75-80 degrees Fahrenheit, and then put into a sulfurous acid action tank and simultaneously infused with 12 degrees BX (Brix concentration) lime water and 7-8% sulfur dioxide to remove impurities and colored substances from the sugarcane juice. Then, it is sent to a heater and heated to 105 degrees Fahrenheit, and then the impurities are precipitated and separated in the sedimentation tank. This has to go through two precipitations and screenings, and then the filter mud is pressed by a filter press. The obtained filter cake contains a lot of calcium, phosphorus and organic matter, which can be transported to the farm for fertilizer. The obtained clarified juice of 15 degrees BX is pumped into an evaporator with four-fold effectiveness to obtain a raw sugar syrup of 50 degrees BX, and then bleached again with sulfur dioxide in the sugar syrup sulfurous acidifier, and then input into a vacuum pot to concentrate the crystal product to obtain a sugar paste of 94 degrees BX. After being placed in a crystallization aid to fully crystallize, it is stirred through a sugar paste mixer, and then separated from the sugar by a divider, and the sugar made at this time is called No. 1 sugar. After being dried and packaged into finished products, the sugar will have a sugar content of about 8 degrees BX, and then vacuumed and concentrated to 94 degrees BX, and then crystallized by a divider to obtain No. 2 sugar and No. 2 sugar. After being concentrated, the crystallization of 96 degrees BX will be obtained to form No. 3 sugar, and the remaining No. 3 sugar can be used to manufacture alcohol and yeast.

People who eat sugar are happy for a moment, but who knows that its production has so many cumbersome procedures?

"Died" a New Insecticide

"Died" insecticide is extracted from Derris Beuth, a specialty of Taiwan. Its natural distribution is in Annam, Siam, Malaysia, etc. In the past, there was a saying in Malaysia: "No Tuba, no vegetables." (Tuba means Derris) It can be seen that the insecticide effect of Derris has long been discovered. The Taichung Sugar Factory used to use it to kill sugarcane pests and once owned 408 Jia of Derris farms. Now it is manufacturing a solution called "Died", a common insecticide. The most important ingredient in "Died" is rotenone, which is extremely toxic. A solution of one million times can kill a carp that is more than three feet long.

Derris essence can be extracted from Derris, which is even more terrible in toxicity. It was also made here and sold to the United States.

This Derris plant is planted on the farm of the Taichung Sugar Factory. An average of 2,000 catties can be harvested from one Jia (15 mu), but it can only be harvested once every three years to use it to contain sufficient rotenone. Therefore, the labor cost is quite expensive. People also plant it privately, and the Taichung Sugar Factory also collects it from them every year at a price of 15 yuan per catty.

The factory that manufactures "Died" has the following mechanical equipment: five cutting machines, one air heating device, one hot air dryer, four pulverizers, two screening machines, a mixer stand, and a steam can. The manufacturing process is very simple. I only spent half an hour there and saw its finished product. The Tao can make more than 500 catties every day.

Mixing Derris powder with soapy water can make the medicinal properties more durable. The Tainan Prefecture Farmers' Association has tested it and achieved satisfactory results. Some people took this medicine to Shanghai for testing and also proved that its insecticidal power exceeds DDT. This authentic and excellent domestic insecticide is very worth introducing and recommending to the people of the country.

### The Current State of Education in Hebei

— Yang Bingshen, Our Newspaper Reporter

Baoding, January 2nd Dispatch

This reporter recently visited He Yixin, the director of the Education Department of Hebei Province, to inquire about the general situation of education in Hebei Province. Director He kindly provided a detailed account, covering the entire spectrum of education in Hebei. After careful recording by this reporter, it is presented to our readers.

During the War of Resistance Against Japan, the education in this province can be divided into four stages: First, the year following the outbreak of the war was a period of destruction, during which the original educational undertakings in this province were devastated by the Japanese invaders. Second, from September of the 27th year [1938] when the provincial government returned to Hebei, to January of the 29th year [1940], various aspects of education were able to be developed and promoted within the province, which can be called a period of progress. Third, from February of the 29th year [1940] onwards, the Provincial Department of Education resided in the province of Lin and focused more on relief efforts, which can be called a period of relief. Fourth, from the 32nd year [1943] onwards until the enemy's surrender, the emphasis was on preparing for repatriation, which can be called a period of preparation for repatriation.

Progress Route

Before Japan surrendered, its defeat was certain. The repatriation work of education in this province had already begun. In the 32nd year [1943], a registration of educational repatriation talent was conducted. Within one year after repatriation, the total number of schools received and restored was six higher education institutions (universities and colleges), forty-four public and private senior and junior high schools, thirty-three provincial and county normal schools and short-term normal schools, fourteen provincial elementary schools and kindergartens, twenty-nine provincial and county public education centers, and four mobile teaching groups. The number of schools is vastly different from before the war. School facilities and student coursework are also far inferior to pre-war levels, because most counties in this province were occupied by the Communist Party, the flames of war have not ceased, railways were destroyed, and transportation was blocked, making it particularly difficult to promote education. However, this province is still striving to overcome all difficulties. The main tasks are: (1) Strengthening guidance work in schools. All schools uniformly implement a tutor system, focusing on students' life training and spiritual training, guiding students' thinking, correcting extremist ideas, and implementing military training. All kinds of guidance regulations newly promulgated by the central government after the war are printed and distributed to schools for compliance. The Education Department also sends inspectors to supervise and improve at any time and place. (2) Revising the curriculum and implementing screening. During the eight years of Hebei's occupation, the curriculum of each school was not in accordance with the central government's regulations, and the content of textbooks even more violated the spirit of the Three Principles of the People. After receiving each school, Hebei urged each school to intensify remedial education in the Three Principles of the People. All students in school or graduates participate in the screening. (3) Providing relief to poor young people in various schools. Most of the students in each school whose families were in communist areas have lost their relief. The provincial government immediately sought to allocate food, distributing 50 jin of miscellaneous grains per person per month. This year, the central government was requested to allocate funds to relieve 750 students. Three summer camps were held during the summer vacation, training up to 3,000 students. (4) Promoting national education. Wherever the government's power reaches the counties, actively prepare to establish national schools. According to recent statistics, there are already 348 central national schools and 2,318 national schools. In addition, the qualifications of civic education teachers and counselors in secondary schools are reviewed, and various sectors of society are mobilized to run people's schools and other urgent educational tasks.

Future Policy

In the future, the primary educational policy of Hebei Province is to cooperate with the needs of the Party, government, and military departments, and continue to complete the repatriation work. However, at present, because the provincial government's power has not been smoothly developed, the plan is to gradually develop education in all counties of the province as the security circle expands, thoroughly eradicate all reactionary forces and obstacles in the educational advancement, and fully promote education under the national unified education system. Secondly, it is necessary to improve the knowledge level of the people. After the War of Resistance Against Japan, the people of Hebei Province were ravaged by Japanese invaders and communist troops, and their knowledge was poor and their lives were degraded, which is the greatest crisis for the nation. Therefore, at present, special emphasis is placed on the development of national education and livelihood education, with the aim of improving the people's knowledge level and living standards, so that we can talk about rural autonomy and rural construction. In addition, in line with the national construction plan, we will train various talents. Our leader, in his book "China's Destiny," formulated a ten-year construction plan for our country after the war, which requires more than 2.46 million technical talents of various types. This province should cooperate with this point to train various required talents and complete the great construction goals of our country. Also, we people of Hebei must carry forward the spirit of Hebei. The people of Yan and Zhao are mostly generous and tragic, with special spirits such as being brave and simple, emphasizing promises, and distinguishing between right and wrong. Lin Xiangru, Yang Jiaoshan, Sun Chengzong, and Yan Xizhai in history are all predecessors of Hebei and can be our representatives.

However, after Hebei was occupied, the people universally felt the enslavement and degradation education of the enemy and traitors. National justice and the spirit of Yan and Zhao have gradually declined. Now we must use the power of education to develop them, striving for every school to become a national fortress, every teacher to become a national mentor, every student to become a national fighter, and every society and every group to become a national furnace. Only in this way can Hebei have hope, and the country can be revived.

### Landlord Drowning in Debt Commits Suicide

The electric lights in Weixian are much brighter than those in Jinan. The street lights illuminate the streets like daytime. On several relatively wide streets, pedestrians are bustling and still selling orchids. The weaving and fruit industries are relatively prosperous and developed here. However, according to people who understand the inside story, the situation is indeed getting worse year by year. Ding Shuyan, known as the richest man in Weixian, committed suicide by poisoning himself last New Year's Eve due to excessive debt, which is the most obvious example.

Originally, before the war, Ding Shuyan's real estate exceeded 10,000 acres and was known as "Half of Weixian is Ding's." Ding was naturally magnanimous, heroic, and righteous, and his poetry, calligraphy, and paintings were all top-notch. In his youth, he traveled to Donghua and exchanged poems and interacted with Hu Shi and Chuan Sinian. When he grew up, he was elected as a representative of the province and engaged in political circles. After the outbreak of the War of Resistance Against Japan, he joined the guerrilla forces, donating funds and food without reservation. After the victory, due to the endless war, his debts accumulated to 400 million yuan, and he needed to pay more than one million in interest every day. Although he still owned 300 to 400 houses and more than 5,000 acres of land, because the rent collection was hopeless and there was no way to sell them, he finally swallowed four ounces of opium paste and committed suicide on New Year's Eve. Insiders said: This is not only Ding's personal tragedy, but also a sign that the industrial, commercial, and financial circles of Weixian are about to collapse. The Spring Festival is coming soon, and I don't know how many companies will fall into crisis with Ding's death!

### Complete Line of Jiaoji Railway (II) Departure from Weixian

— Litian, Special Correspondent in Shandong

This newspaper's dispatch on the 11th

Weixian is the only city in Eastern Shandong that has not been liberated by the Communist Army. On the surface, it almost completely retains its pure inland scenery. Many of the bungalows lined up on both sides of the street from the station to the city are thatched huts, and some small inns are still posting red paper signs to attract passing travelers. The rectangular stone slabs paved on the streets that have not been completely widened are uneven due to years of disrepair, making all travelers and vehicles feel tired and arduous when passing through. Since I got off the train after 4:00 p.m., the time did not allow me to browse the street scenery, so I had to rush to visit Xia Chuzhong, the commander-in-chief of the highest military authority here.

When I arrived at the headquarters, General Xia was out due to some business, so Chief of Staff Tang Menghe received me first. Tang served as the director of the Changsha Police Department around the 28th year of the Republic of China [1939] and was an old acquaintance of mine. We first exchanged our situations after parting, and then he told me many actual situations inside the Communist Army, the plight of the people under the Communist Army's rule, all the gunners and part of the machine gunners in the Communist Army are Japanese prisoners, and there are also advisors from ×× in the Communist Army. In the Battle of Laizhou in November last year, we found many corpses of Japanese prisoners.

General Xia Chuzhong on Draining Ponds to Catch Fish

After about half an hour of talking, Commander Xia returned! This is General Xia Chuzhong, who participated in the Songhu Anti-Japanese War five years ago, the first, second, and third Changsha battles, and assisted General Wang Zuomin in completing the Xiangxi victory. The first impression he gave me was that he was much plumper than before. With a Hunan accent, he first asked me about my views on national affairs. Naturally, I replied without hesitation that "politics comes first." He agreed with this point completely, but he believed that the problem in China today is still "three parts military and seven parts politics." Then he told me: "The Communist Army avoids fighting hard battles in the military. They go back and forth, coming and going, and are accustomed to launching attacks. Unless they can take advantage of their numbers and have full confidence, they will never act rashly. Therefore, our garrison troops will suffer if they are not careful. In politics, a small number of core cadres are lurking in every village, trying to meet the requirements of military coordination. For this, General Xia's specific method is: the National Army has absolute confidence in fighting the regular Communist Army. Then, we should thoroughly attack the three tactics of the Communist Army. The Communist Army is like fish, and the people are water. The best way to catch all the fish and shrimp is to drain the water and strive to win over the people, organize the people, and prevent them from hiding, which is equivalent to draining the pond to catch fish. While we are developing the military, we must pay more attention to politics to counter the politics of the Communist Party. The Communist Party has farmers' associations, so we will organize relief groups to deal with them. Since the returning team has returned to their hometown, it has lost its effect. We must use this resource to connect one person with five people, and then connect to twenty-five people. Then connect to one hundred and twenty-five people, gather them together, and they will become a permanently stable force. This force is the most basic force of the people."

General Xia was very talkative. He concluded that we should try to organize as many returning teams as possible in the recaptured areas to allow them to reform themselves and avoid killing them.

### Supplementary Conditions for Civil Litigation - Article 12 Impacts Society Theory

— Li Qun

Recently, Article 12 of the Supplementary Regulations for Civil Litigation states that the court should fairly determine whether to increase or decrease payments if the original effect is obviously unfair. The Four Banks' deposit case, with a precedent of repaying the principal a thousandfold, has caused widespread panic and instability throughout society. Financial experts, legal scholars, economists, and prominent politicians in Shanghai have expressed their opinions in newspaper forums. Aside from those who were somewhat biased and arbitrary, most discussions focused on financial, legal, and banking perspectives. Only one gentleman mentioned the relationship to farmers. In fact, it has a significant impact on the entire society, not just farmers, yet those who discussed it failed to deeply examine this aspect, which is truly surprising.

Today's commentators all start with national debt, arguing that if private debts are repaid a thousandfold, the nation should do the same. They argue that even though the country is poor now, adding an expenditure would not have a major impact, merely increasing the burden on the people. This would force those who do not hold debt notes to fulfill obligations to those who do, which is hardly fair. Furthermore, legal tender banknotes are also the nation's debt. If people hold pre-war banknotes or customs gold units, can they demand to exchange them for recent banknotes at an increased rate?

The reason for repaying old debts at an increased rate is that prices were low in the past but have risen today. If it is decided that pre-war debts should be increased, what about the first year after the war (1938), when prices actually fell? Prices rose slightly in 1939 and then increased annually, ten times, dozens of times, hundreds of times, thousands of times, even several thousand times, reaching their peak on the eve of the enemy's surrender. Therefore, fairness must extend to all years after the war. If one wants to seek fairness by reflecting the value effect, then it must be calculated based on the annual price of a certain type of commodity. Over time, the question of how much prices have changed becomes very complex, especially for banks. Their annual inflows and outflows are numerous, and a retroactive calculation would overturn everything. Increasing repayments to others and increasing demands from others would become too numerous to rationally handle. Moreover, since the victory, prices have risen significantly again. Should this also be increased? If a loan is doubled today, and prices fluctuate next year, should it be calculated according to commodity prices? If prices fall, can the principal be reduced? If it is said that the current law is designed for old debts and will not be questioned in the future, then the effect is considered for the former but not the latter. Where is the so-called fairness in that? If it is also calculated according to commodities, it will lead to endless losses. Regardless of past or present, the unit of borrowing is legal tender, not commodities, but repayment must be based on the value effect, regardless of the unit. If the law states that the effect is obviously unfair, how will that disrupt the financial system?

Banks operate by accepting deposits and making loans, earning a small profit. Now, if they suddenly have to repay people a thousandfold, is that appropriate? Furthermore, some banks are financially weak, which will lead to bankruptcies, further disrupting the financial system.

Although, for national debt, the nation is large and there is naturally no problem. For bank deposits, the banks are wealthy,

Even if repayments are doubled, and even if the procedures are cumbersome, it seems that all can cope with it reluctantly except a few financially weak small banks. However, the disturbance among ordinary people concerns the entire society. All the commentators have not mentioned this, how strange it is!

Especially for farmers in rural areas, the relationship is extremely close. The creditors to whom they owe debts are often local bullies. If the law of doubling repayments exists, even if the court can make discretionary adjustments, the rumor of doubling repayments will provide an excuse for those who want to oppress the good. The poor and helpless will have no choice but to accept it silently. Soon, a small old debt of several hundred yuan will lead to the seizure of their cattle, sheep, and fields. Therefore, the legislation cannot be taken care of casually, and this is not only for farmers.

In today's society, who does not have both claims and debts? After the United States' silver purchase policy before the war, the money supply was extremely tight, leading to a national recession and bankruptcies of industrial and commercial businesses. The number of private debts for daily expenses is unknown. Furthermore, the country has suffered from war and invasion. Since the eight-year War of Resistance, the pressure of rising prices has been such that, unless they are major traitors or war profiteers who hoard goods, ordinary law-abiding people are increasingly in dire straits, living off their savings and increasing their debt. Even those who are able to run businesses or have skills that can be used, or who still have some remaining property, can barely make a living. Since the national crisis, there are many such people in society. If you say they are poor, they can still live or still have some status, or even still have some property. If you say they are rich, their lives are extremely difficult. There are already the most people of this kind, and there are even more who are not as good as them. From the perspective of the creditor, due to the low value of the currency, they have a "can gain or can lose" attitude, and do not want to add more pressure. The debtor, on the other hand, tries hard to economize in order to prepare for repayment, for anyone who is not completely helpless will be concerned about their integrity. Both sides can resolve things peacefully and sincerely. But now, suddenly, there is a law of doubling repayments. Because the multiplier effect turns small amounts into large amounts, who would not want to sue and aggressively collect in order to obtain this large amount of wealth? They will spare no effort to pursue it, but those who are in debt from before will not be able to cope. In the end, after being forced to litigate, the actual gains will be limited, and what they get will only be a large worthless check. On the debtor's side, they could have preserved their integrity and resolved things, but now they are suddenly burdened by the litigation resulting from the doubled amount. Their houses will be sealed and their furniture will be auctioned off, but it will not be enough. They will have to declare bankruptcy, causing their elderly mother and beloved wife to lose their support, and their children to lose their education. Their integrity and reputation will be permanently lost. How tragic is that! If the debtor had suffered this plight without the doubling of the debt, it would be tragic, but also appropriate. Now, if the law had not doubled the debt, nothing would have happened. If this tragedy occurs because the law doubles the debt, then it is the fault of the legislator. The law wants to cherish the old creditor's rights, but only makes them exhaust their energy to litigate and gain little. It wants to punish the old debtors, but it doubles or triples the debt and inevitably leads them to bankruptcy, even to the destruction of their families. How can they bear it? Their debts in the past were unavoidable. They did not borrow money to hoard goods, but the law treats them as if they did so with the aim to hoard goods and raise prices. Is that not excessive? Furthermore, some people who were debtors in the past also had some claims at the same time, and some people who were creditors also had some debts at the same time. Therefore, under this law, there will be lawsuits and demands everywhere. All can be stopped but the situation is changed beyond recognition, because the multiplier effect has intensified it. It is foreseeable that the entire society will be in turmoil. It is like throwing a huge bomb into still water, causing waves and overflows, causing large and small boats to collide with each other in the vortex, eventually injuring the large ones and capsizing the small ones. Alas! It is too much. As the saying goes, "There is nothing wrong in the world, but fools make trouble for themselves." Is this what it means?

Those who govern and teach the country consider stabilizing the people's livelihood to be the best policy. It has never been heard that agitating the people's livelihood is a good policy. Teaching the people to resolve disputes and promote concession is the foundation of pure social customs. It has never been heard that guiding them to engage in vigorous lawsuits is a good thing. Moreover, the politics of all countries today emphasize society and the people's livelihood. The ancient sages had the teaching of not worrying about scarcity but worrying about inequality. Therefore, for those who make laws for the country, rather than increasing the wealth of those who have, why not help those who lack to recover? This is the equality of inequality.

Moreover, the multitude of disputes among the people is not auspicious for the country. I read Yan Ze's "Evolution and Ethics" when I was young and was impressed by the saying that one must eliminate internal strife before winning external strife. Therefore, Duke Xiao of Qin made the people timid in private quarrels and brave in public battles, while King Wen of Zhou promoted benevolence and had the people cease litigation and concede land boundaries. Although the methods of hegemony were different, the goal was the same: to make the people cease internal strife and strive for the public good. At present, the country needs to revive everything and must rely on the people's unity of mind and effort, collective wisdom, and concerted effort. Why set so many laws to stir up the people's hearts? It is said, "Hearing lawsuits is like being a human, it is essential to make there be no lawsuits." Now there are courts of mediation in civil law to reduce lawsuits and resolve disputes. The intention is good. Why, in this supplementary regulation for civil litigation, add this particularly extraordinary Article 12, which, although intended to be fair, is unknowingly stirring up disputes among the people and making the entire society uneasy. This is truly a major mistake of the legislator. Although the judiciary can sometimes exercise discretion in making judgments and determining the severity of the situation, the fundamental law is such that the people will inevitably engage in disputes because of this. One case will be right, and another case will be wrong, the situations will be completely different, and it will be difficult for the case law to comply with the equality of the value effect. The so-called basis of effect is to disregard the legal tender standard and shake it, turning it into the commodity value at any time. Currency or commodities? The people have nowhere to go. Alas, alas, the poor masses will be unable to win lawsuits and will be unable to stop the disturbances! Therefore, to remedy this mistake, the judiciary's creation of more case law will not be able to achieve it. Only the Legislative Yuan can abolish Article 12, so that the law remains based on legal tender, and commodity values remain separate, clearly defined and not mixed together. This will eliminate such unnecessary disputes and will not increase social unrest.

I recently heard a suggestion that the highest authorities intend to amend the law to increase compound interest. This would not shake the status of legal tender, but the so-called compound interest would still have to be repaid at hundreds or thousands of times the original amount. This will have the same impact on social unrest as discussed above. The debts of the general public are often due to the pre-war recession and the pressure of rising living expenses since the war, and they have not yet recovered. How can they bear this? It is the way to disorder to force them when they know they cannot bear it. As for whether the existing banks have the ability to cope with this, it is another question and not the focus of this discussion.

I am writing this because the viewpoints of the commentators place too much emphasis on banks, etc., and do not consider the harm to the entire society. (End)

### Splendor in the Sky Special Edition

— Ma Bolang

"Splendor in the Sky," originally titled "Ziegfeld Follies," was produced by MGM in August 1945.

MGM's musical films consistently feature dazzling colors, grand and innovative sets. "Bathing Beauty," "The Ziegfeld Girl," and "Yolanda and the Thief" are all like that. "Splendor in the Sky" is an even more anticipated gathering of red-hot stars. Its subject matter still centers on the stories of the sensational Ziegfeld Follies in America. The role of the boss, Florenz Ziegfeld, is once again played by the veteran star William Powell. This time, he was exceptionally invited to strengthen the cast. He is the husband of the late blonde bombshell Jean Harlow. The film is divided into twelve short skits, featuring songs, dances, and comedy, each starring several major stars. Filming took three years and employed two sets of photography teams to shoot a total of seventeen combined scenes and forty-five individual scenes. In addition, seventy-five female tailors were hired to sew four hundred gorgeous costumes for the major stars and Ziegfeld girls.

The cast is composed of MGM's rising stars, gathered together. The king of dance, Fred Astaire, lends his support, starring in "Limehouse Blues." He announced his retirement at the end of last year and will no longer dance. This is a rare opportunity to see him. His partner is MGM's new dance star, Lucille Bremer, who made her debut in the 1945 technicolor musical "Yolanda and the Thief." With her beautiful appearance, Life magazine featured her photo on the cover and published a full-page photo of her in a bubble bath. Red-haired beauty Lucille Ball, the star of "The Ziegfeld Girl," leads the performance in the "Merry-Go-Round" scene. Lucille and a group of Ziegfeld girls ride snow-white handsome horses, singing and dancing lightly, filled with spring. Esther Williams, the bathing beauty from "Bathing Beauty," has a novel and surprising performance here, wearing a sparkling gold and silver swimsuit, dancing ballet underwater. The patterns are new and never seen before. Ballet is the most wonderful art in the world. The stage performance must be transcendentally trained. Once underwater, the dancer is suppressed by the water. To be able to do such graceful dance moves is extremely dazzling. Kathryn Grayson, the female lead of "Thousands Cheer," "Ziegfeld Follies," and "Anchors Aweigh," sings the theme song "Beauty." Her singing voice has a different flavor and is deeply captivating. MGM's darling Judy Garland plays a movie star who is bothered by reporters. She is one of America's top ten box office stars in recent years and has remained consistently popular. Some worry that after she grows into a young woman, her songs and dances will not have a future, but "Meet Me in St. Louis" has good results. Gene Kelly, the male lead in "Thousands Cheer," also has a wonderful performance. His attractive appearance in "Christmas Holiday" has long been established. His dance skills can be seen in "Cover Girl" and "The Ziegfeld Girl." With Fred Astaire's retirement and George Murphy's conservative silence, Gene Kelly will be the boss. The old rogue Victor Moore from "Star Spangled Rhythm," veteran villain star Edward Arnold, and rising comedian Rags Ragland play comedic roles. Lina Romay, a famous singer from South America, is renowned in America. Her skin is slightly dark, and her tone is different from Carmen Miranda's, singing "Love" and "Liza," which are relatively gentle. Keenan Wynn, who starred in the best comedic skit "Number Please," is a good friend of MGM's red-hot young star Van Johnson. He is a famous figure in Hollywood, and his comedy is highly praised by Americans. MGM attaches great importance to him.

The film is directed by Vincente Minnelli, Judy Garland's new husband. Among MGM's and Hollywood's rising directors, he is one of the most accomplished. In "Meet Me in St. Louis," the secret whispers of a young couple after the meeting, and the singing concert with flower clusters on the streetcar, all hold warm memories, the life that we have lived through. "The Clock," one of the best films of 1945, and "Undercurrent," the recent work of Robert Taylor and Katharine Hepburn who returned to the screen, are his glorious milestones. He is a very promising director.

### About Ziegfeld

— Bo Ning

The story of Ziegfeld is the story of Broadway because his life's work has been rendered into the most glorious page in the history of American song and dance.

Ziegfeld's era was the most extravagant era in America. It was an era when chorus girls could earn large rewards simply by virtue of their beauty, and it was also an era when diamond kings used ten-carat diamonds as buttons on their clothes. Ziegfeld never treated money as a serious matter. It came today, and it left tomorrow, without him even batting an eyelid. When he failed in a business venture and lost as much as two million dollars, he would only say to his beloved wife with a careless tone: "I've failed again!"

Currently, there are still many well-known people in the American film and dance industry who are former members of Ziegfeld's troupe. Comedy talents such as Eddie Cantor, Will Rogers, Marilyn Miller, and Lillee Fields were all created by him. Also, Virginia Bruce, a star who was extremely popular before the war, was one of them. In addition, he discovered many beautiful and charming showgirls.

Ziegfeld was a well-mannered and elegant gentleman, kind by nature, and slightly superstitious. He was the first person to infuse truth, goodness, and beauty into opera. Beauties elevated their status because of his selection and promotion, and his extravagant and grand "Ziegfeld Follies" undoubtedly created the highest peak in the beautiful song and dance world.

The chorus girls in his troupe were all carefully selected by him, and they were called "Ziegfeld Girls." This was the focus of each of his operas, and he tried every means to make them as perfect as possible. As for the structure of the story, it was not what he valued.

Since its founding in 19xx, the Ziegfeld Follies has produced many masterpieces over the years, which have stirred up countless audiences. His three operas, "The Three Musketeers," "Rosalie," and "Show Boat," were performed simultaneously on Broadway, which simply fascinated the men and women of the entire United States.

Ziegfeld was very casual (and therefore often unfaithful). He rarely smiled, so his friends and subordinates called him "Cold Face" behind his back. However, he was extremely hospitable and enthusiastic, sometimes generously giving people ten thousand US dollars at once, without even asking for any guarantees.

He loved making phone calls and sending telegrams the most. Besides appreciating beautiful women, this was another thing he loved.

Ziegfeld is dead, and Broadway's fame has gradually been replaced by Hollywood, but the name Ziegfeld has not been obliterated by the tides of the times. Even Hollywood filmmakers cannot forget him, repeatedly picking up his deeds or his extravagant style to make films. Ziegfeld is, after all, the cornerstone of Broadway!

### No Story Structure

— Lin

"Splendor in the Sky" has a bold feature: no story structure. This is a magnificent musical and dance work on the screen, with one program following another, the scenes are extravagant and gorgeous, the colors are beautiful and dazzling, but the story structure has been abandoned.

Because the performance of the Ziegfeld Follies at that time did not attach the most importance to this point, "Splendor in the Sky" abandoned this point to express its loyalty to Ziegfeld.

### Lifelike New-Style Puppet Show Without Wires

— Zuo Xi

In "Splendor in the Sky," a group of lively, lifelike puppets without wires appear on the screen for the first time. These eight-inch-long dwarfs show the vivid picture unique to movies, just like real people.

This is Burr Tillstrom's latest style of puppet show.

Movie audiences will see the former Ziegfeld Follies stars dancing on the screen again. These puppets are made of a secret material that is very elastic, so their movements closely resemble those of real people. When the puppets laugh, even the corners of their mouths can show dimples. In order to show these subtle effects, only seven feet of film can be shot each day for certain dance shots. The "Legs" dance, which lasts for one minute on the screen, takes fifteen days to shoot. Five hundred puppets are used to perform the different movements of the six puppets.

Tillstrom's unique skill was learned from the Parisian art world. He studied sculpture with the famous artist Bourdelle, and in 1924 he held a solo exhibition in his hometown of Chicago. He began his career as a puppet master in the puppet show "From Morning to Midnight." His first performance of a puppet show that closely resembled real people was in a short film at the Petroleum Exhibition at the New York World's Fair. In 1943, he joined MGM Studios to film "Splendor in the Sky." After thirteen months of hard work, he used his puppets to create a small history of the former Ziegfeld Follies stars. Among them, Eddie Cantor sings, and Will Rogers dances with ropes.

Costumes and characters are equally important. The clothes worn by Tillstrom's puppets are specially designed to imitate the original Ziegfeld costumes. Even their hair has been specially styled, and their eyebrows have to be curled every day!

### Splendor in the Sky - All Kinds of Colors

— Xin Ming

"Splendor in the Sky" is immersed in a lively atmosphere from beginning to end. In this film, Ziegfeld is dead and living a comfortable life in heaven. This role is played by William Powell, while other comedic stars Rags Ragland, Victor Moore, and Keenan Wynn replace the old-time Will Rogers, Leon Errol, etc.

In terms of song and dance, the "Dance Saint" Fred Astaire is now responsible for three scenes, two of which partner with the new star Lucille Bremer, and one is a tap dance with Gene Kelly. The dance steps are novel, and the costumes are unique. In addition, there is Esther Williams' swimming, Judy Garland and Kathryn Grayson's singing, each song is pleasing and fascinating, plus Lucille Ball's dance drama. It's really a competition of beauty, and the beauty is endless.

### The Brilliant Silver Stars in a Kaleidoscope: Four Angels of Splendid Paradise

— Qi

(1) Lucille Bremer was born in Amityville, New York. At the age of twelve, she began performing in Billy Reed's dance troupe. At sixteen, she gained fame at Radio City Music Hall in New York, leading to her being appreciated by MGM. Her first appearance on the silver screen was as Judy Garland's older sister in "Meet Me in St. Louis." Recently, she has often collaborated with dance king Fred Astaire, with new works including "Yolanda and the Thief." In "Splendid Paradise," she is also the dance king's partner. She is five feet four inches tall, weighs 111 pounds, has red hair, and azure eyes. She enjoys walking, swimming, and watching movies.

(2) Esther Williams is now a sweetheart beloved by American soldiers worldwide. She is a Californian. When she was unable to speak, her mother would place her on the beach, letting the waves impact her body. This is why she has such swimming achievements today. She once wanted to participate in the Olympic swimming competition, but due to the outbreak of World War II, she had to abandon this plan. In 1940, after graduating from high school, she worked as a saleswoman in a sporting goods store. In the summer of the same year, she met a producer from MGM, who appreciated her and signed a contract. Her first work was "Bathing Beauty," and "Million Dollar Mermaid" is her most popular film. In the current "Splendid Paradise," she once again performs water ballet.

(3) Judy Garland's parents worked in a musical troupe. At the age of three, her father asked her to perform on stage. Later, she continuously performed with her two older sisters. As a child, she aspired to be a lawyer. One summer, while singing somewhere, she was discovered by a talent scout from MGM because her singing was so good. The next day, she appeared with Deanna Durbin in "Every Sunday Afternoon." Since then, she has had smooth sailing, successively co-starring with Mickey Rooney in the Hardy Family film series. Her recent works include "Ziegfeld Follies," "Till the Clouds Roll By," and "Words and Music."

(4) Kathryn Grayson is young, beautiful, and has a melodious singing voice. Since signing a contract with MGM, she has undergone three years of extremely rigorous training. Whether it is vocal music, expression, makeup, posture, etc., she has diligently studied everything before emerging. Her first film was as the lead in Pasternak's "Seven Sweethearts," creating a sensation. In "Splendid Paradise," she headlines with the song "Bella Signorina," which implicitly shows the importance placed on her.

Spring and Autumn

### From Wu Changshuo to Qi Baishi

— Lu Danlin

A few days ago, painter Qi Baishi went south, holding a painting exhibition with his works, which once caused a sensation in the art world. Many newspapers and periodicals have commented on Qi's works. In these commentaries, Wu Changshuo is often mentioned in comparison, referring to "Southern Wu and Northern Qi." Indeed, Wu and Qi each have their respective significant positions in the modern Chinese painting history. However, their accomplishments are different, just like Liang Qichao and Zhang Shizhao, Zhou Shuren and Guo Moruo, whose articles each have their own style and unique characteristics, and cannot be viewed in the same way.

Let me first talk about Wu Changshuo's poetry, painting, and seal carving. Xie Yucen said that Wu's creative spirit was: "Born in the late Qing Dynasty, his poetry coincided with the surge of the Tongguang Min-Gan schools; his painting coincided with the popularity of the Shanyin and Yuanhu styles; his calligraphy followed An Wu and Yi Zheng; and his seal carving followed the Eight Masters of Xiling." Indeed, Wu was untouched by all of these at that time, never restricted by them, and was able to pioneer his own path. One day, Hu Gongshou said to Wu: "Your interest in painting seems too late." Because Wu began to learn painting after the age of thirty. Ren Bonian, who was present at the time, followed by saying: "If one has talent in the heart and rhythm in the brush, what does it matter if it is late!" Yang Jianshan also said: "Painting does not come from painting, but is based on poetry, writing, and bronze inscriptions. Accumulating deep strength can carry a large boat, which means understanding the supreme Zen." It can be seen that Wu's works all have a realm and meaning that ancient people did not have, and form a unique genre. He is able to learn and change, entering first and then exiting, which fits the modern concept of the true essence of creation.

The above is an objective commentary. What about Wu's own subjective thoughts? Wu's painting poems say: "The ink escapes the hand, pushing the stele together; tadpole old moss, clerical branches and trunks. Who can recognize this, like with Yong!" He also said: "Saying it is seal script, not painting." And also said: "The scorpion changes into twisting branches." Clearly, Wu advocated and practiced using seal script and clerical script calligraphy to paint. Wu's comments on seal carving say: "The disease of counterfeiting the ancients cannot be cured; the traces of Deng are densely displayed and abandoned. Caressing day and night, if there is gain, outside of Chen and Deng, there is still no merit. How many people in the world learn from the Qin and Han dynasties? But seeking resemblance leads to fatigue... Believing that the knife reaches where the intention must be, leisurely and skillful, very comfortable." He also said: "The iron script is directly permitted by the Prime Minister of Qin, shaking off the shackles of Chen and Deng." It can be seen that he not only changed some of the original forms when writing the Stone Drum Inscriptions but also wanted to "create his own antiquity" when carving seals, striving not to rely on others. For example, when painting, he often inscribed "Learning from Chen Yu Fan, Li Fu Tang, Wu Rang Zhi, Zhang Meng Gao," which shows that his painting is only occasionally involved in their interests and is by no means a complete imitation of a certain person.

Regarding his own poetry writing, Wu said: "My poems express my own nature and feelings, without knowing whether they are different or the same." His friend Shi Xuchen described his poems as: "...All expressing his nature and feelings, not compromising with the present nor forcing himself to imitate the past, which is what is meant by being able to establish himself!" Dong Qichang spoke well of calligraphy, "In the beginning, it must be in accordance with the ancients, and later it must be separated from the ancients." Accordance is exploring the rules (techniques) of the ancients, while separation is expressing (displaying) one's own spirit. From Wu's own words about his poetry, calligraphy, painting, and seal carving, we can use Huang Shangu's two lines of poetry, "Following others' plans will always be behind others, creating one's own style is the beginning of approaching the truth," as a very appropriate explanation of his absolute and relative artistic writing.

Wu's paintings mostly feature pine, plum, chrysanthemum, bamboo, orchid, and stones. He occasionally creates miscellaneous flowers and birds. His landscape style is very high, but he rarely paints landscapes after middle age, and he paints the least portraits. His freehand flowers have vigorous and elegant brushstrokes, slightly resembling Xu Qing Teng and Chen Bai Yang. However, his ancient, simple, profound, and rich charm traces back to the Yuan and Song dynasties, and even to the Wu Liang Shrine portraits, with wonderful transformations. His composition and coloring are truly as Shen Zipei said, "Containing ten thousand strange things in his chest." His use of ink is both dry and wet, with natural shades, clear and refined, deeply understanding the ancient saying "Moist containing spring rain, dry cracked autumn wind," especially in places where "dirt shows purity, and purity contains dirt," which is not something that those who only know how to smear can comprehend the fun of. He once said, "Painting should be bold in the brushstrokes and careful in the finishing touches." If painting is compared to writing, then bold brushstrokes are equivalent to circulating the chapter, and careful finishing touches are equivalent to pursuing and refining the sentence. Therefore, his paintings can show precision in the wildness, clarity in the richness, and the inner meaning and outer appearance seem to be in the painting and yet not in the painting.

Qi Baishi's family background is of a different class than Wu Changshuo's. Of the ancients, Qi most despises the Four Wangs (Wang Shimin, Wang Jian, Wang Yuanqi), and most admires Shi Tao, while learning from Xu Qing Teng and Bada Shanren. Of the modern people, he only loves Wu Changshuo. Qi has a seven-character quatrain that says: "Qing Teng and Xue Ge are far from the mundane; Old Fu (Wu Changshuo's pseudonym) is extraordinarily talented. I want to be a running dog in the underworld (Zheng Banqiao has a seal: "Zheng Bian, the running dog under the Qing Teng door"), rotating under the doors of the three masters." It can be seen that Qi's admiration for Wu is such that he regards Xu Qing Teng, Bada Shanren, and Wu Changshuo as three-in-one teachers.

Qi's works, poetry, painting, and seal carving each have their own fields. His preface to his poems says: "When it is hot summer, sweat flows down the back, green ants and flies share wild foxes, and cave rats are neighbors. Most of what is stored in the collection directly expresses my feelings. I have no time to write thousands of words with a painful heart and hone myself, learning to write like a otter offering fish!" His mourning poems and quatrains: "Singing loudly to ask for inscriptions, who else are the heroes of the green forest?" Burning draft poems, "Not knowing many characters, but wanting to write poetry." These poems and essays can represent his personality and style.

This time Qi came to Beijing and Shanghai, some people said that Qi is the only leader in the Chinese painting world today. Besides Qi's age, this statement seems excessive in terms of art. But at the same time, some people criticized Qi's works as artistic traitors, wild fox Zen, and also avoided siding with the same party and attacking the different, and worshiped the ancients as idols, forcing people to be slaves to the ancients, hindering the genius of creation. Frankly speaking, in terms of art, both Wu Changshuo and Qi Baishi have jumped out of the shackles of the ancients and displayed their skills. Although Wu and Qi's accomplishments are different, their achievements are also different, but they have already pioneered their own paths and each has its own unique characteristics. This is an undeniable fact.

The lives and actions of artists are often very special. Qi is no exception and has his quirks. Jin Xihou listed him, Wu Peifu, and Sai Jinhua as the three eccentrics of Yanshan. Qi himself and Xuechang and Richang were considered the three eccentrics of Xicheng, saying that they were equal to the Eight Eccentrics of Xicheng, such as Zhao Zishu and Dexiang, during the Tongguang period. Yang Chongzi, however, regarded Qi, Zhang Wushi, Jichan Monk, and Shen Shanren as the four strange people of Xiangtan. Whether strange or different, his temperament and life are different from ordinary people, and his art is naturally special.

Qi's poetry, painting, and seal carving are all self-reliant, creating a new path from hard work. After decades of hard work, he has achieved his own unique works, neither erasing the past nor trending with the times, purely creative. This pioneering (revolutionary) spirit is admirable. Although these rough lines, crude branches and leaves, thick vermilion and black ink are close to rude and vulgar, we must know that this is Qi's characteristic, and it is also what makes Qi's works different from other artists. We must know that Qi's background is as a carpenter. A carpenter with such achievements, able to write poetry, paint, write calligraphy, and carve seals, is certainly not an ordinary person. We must never use the model of a scholar-official to confine a talented, persevering, and creative artist. Just as the painter Giotto, who was as famous as the poet Dante, was a shepherd boy, and Gao Jianfu, a painter from Lingnan, was originally an apprentice in a medicinal herb store, they could not hinder his artistic progress.

In the history of Chinese painting, both Wu and Qi have their own places, which is not a problem. However, Wu and Qi's works were successful in themselves, but this achievement only existed in themselves. As the saying goes, "Those who obtain it live, those who learn it die." Then, "The world values their art, and I value their people." Why? Because those who learn their art are often toiling without success, mostly failing, and not easily achieving anything. At most, they can only get a little superficial knowledge. There is no need to explain the mysteries, because each has his own talent, thoughts, environment, and different accomplishments. Even if they want to learn it, it is in vain. This is what distinguishes Wu Changshuo from Qi Baishi, and it is also the reason why they each have their own achievements.

### On Bonsai

— Dong Shuyu

Although bonsai is a small art, the types are varied, and good compositions are hard to come by. In addition to the difficulty of selecting materials, the creator must not only be familiar with the personality of the plants, but also possess the cultivation of a painter, traveler, and connoisseur, and have a comprehensive artistic talent, coupled with skilled techniques, in order to be successful. "Bonsai" is a general term, and its botanical category includes artistic potted plants and tree-stone bonsai, and its stone category includes potted stones and landscape bonsai.

Each of the above four has its own characteristics. Artistic potted plants focus on planting, and horticulturalists with artistic cultivation are often good at it. In addition to planting, remodeling, and maintenance techniques, the appropriate materials and beautiful postures are the most important. The people of Fusang (Japan) have vigorously promoted it, and there are many fine works. Some people do not hesitate to spend years of effort to cultivate and cultivate, only to create a scene. Artistic potted plants are mostly based on pine, cypress, and evergreen plants, taking their long period of appreciation, and the ancient and elegant tree trunks are considered precious. With the artist's skills, processing and transformation are carried out to make the posture sinuous and twisted, or soaring and upright, and long-term maintenance is required. Looking at it, the spirit is invigorated, and small stones are added between the vigorous green to supplement the lack of scenery. The form of the basin, whether round or square, tall or short, color, and porcelain quality, should also be matched with the shape and color of the plant to be called ancient and lovely.

Tree-stone bonsai is a three-dimensional landscape painting, selecting plants that resemble trees and are suitable for bonsai, matching them with small stones, and building soil blocks into a prototype of mountains and plains; or embellishing them with small pavilions and figures, and lining them with green grass, such as green moss, as grassland. The proportions of trees, stones, and figures must be accurate, and the position of each grass and tree must be appropriate; and the color matching must be clear, elegant, and detached from vulgarity. The creator will not be competent if he does not have the artistic conception of a painter. The pots used should be shallow. The above two are mainly trees, with soil and stones as embellishments.

Potted stone is the simplest of the bonsai, and it is also the so-called Qing Gong in painting. That is, placing stone blocks in shallow water porcelain pots. It is extremely difficult to find stone blocks with high style. The most superior are those with natural shapes, followed by those that need to be slightly processed, and the momentum should be carefully reworked; such as distant mountains, such as island shapes, etc., or taking small scenes, planting a few irises in the gaps of the exquisite stones, which is also a clear and beautiful state and full of interest. Facing each other on the desk is enough to be pleasing to the eye.

Landscape bonsai has a broad artistic conception, like a natural painting of a huge landscape. This type of production is mainly based on stone. Those stones that have the shape of peaks and ridges must first be carved and cut to make their artistic conception match; then piece them together and put them together to form a scene. It is even more difficult to construct huge blocks. If all the carving is lost to nature, there is no natural interest, and it becomes a veritable rockery. Therefore, before a stone is completed, it should be carefully observed, neither forgetting nor helping, and it is too late to regret after rash construction. The nature of the stone is different, such as sand accumulation, tree accumulation, petrified wood, etc., which belong to loose quality. Other Ying stone, Shi Xu, volcanic stone, etc., are all hard in nature. If the carving is not good, there will be obvious axes, so it is necessary to be familiar with the techniques of stone workers and bonding. In addition to the texture of the stone, the arrangement of grass and trees must be clear. And the most important thing is the layout of the whole scene, with a broad mind, and then there will be a superb composition. It is not like a painter painting, with wonderful scenes in his heart, which can be rendered at will. Pot art is limited by location and limited by material. Setting up a scene is not easy. Embellishments are appropriate, not too much, not monotonous, and supplemented by suitable materials, there will be magnificent and beautiful works. Lying down and wandering in a pot, leisurely and contented, the beauty of the scenery is like directly entering the painting realm of the Song and Yuan dynasties, but fine works are hard to come by and can only be encountered but not sought.

The above is a general overview of various bonsai. In addition, there is also a paper-made bonsai, which is made of waste paper and oil blue mixture, and then colored separately. It can be used at will. The method is popular in Dongying (Japan), specializing in making garden models, which is not within the scope of this discussion.

### Talking about Guan Liang's Recent Works

— Ni Yide

A dilapidated old truck is most likely to break down when traveling on a winding and steep mountain road. The engine often emits a heavy, low, hoarse cry and can no longer move forward. When the driver and assistant jump out of the car and patiently repair it, the passengers wait anxiously, which is an extremely unbearable pain. But for a traveling painter, a painter who can discover beauty no matter where he is, it is an excellent opportunity. He can often get valuable harvests at this time and acquire painting materials that are not easy to find at ordinary times.

I guess that many of Guan Liang's recent works were produced in this kind of occasion. That is a kind of desolation and desolation in the deep mountains and big swamps, with a bit of terrifying wildness. People who often live in the plains of Jiangnan can't imagine the scenery in the deep mountains of southwest and northwest China. Thousands of towering peaks surround you in a gloomy core; looking down from thousands of feet of cliffs, the bottom of the ravine silently flows with cold streams; in the dense forest, you occasionally find one or two houses inhabited by mountain dwellers, who are always living a life forgotten by the world; in the lush grass and thorns, it seems that ferocious beasts and tigers suddenly appear; sometimes groups of donkeys, horses and large carts roar past, breaking the silence of the four mountains. Every traveler on the road enjoys this curious appreciation, and the secrets between these deep mountains are now all included in Guan Liang's paintings.

A clever painter always likes to adopt painting materials that are suitable for his own expression, and that kind of subject matter also affects his expression techniques, creating the painter's special style. Guan Liang, he is a person with special achievements in the Chinese painting world, so to understand his works, one must explore his research route. Regarding this, I know a little bit. His painting starts from the standpoint of modern painting after Cézanne. That is to abandon the explanatory and dry writing, explore the rhythm of color in nature, use the relationship of light and dark to express the transition of distance, use deformation to emphasize the characteristics of objects, and seek the unity of the competition surface from the mutual harmony and echo between color, sound and shape. To achieve no technique by technique, to avoid general techniques and pursue special techniques. Then, he discovered that the works of the Shitao school in Chinese painting have a place that coincides with modern Western painting. Shitao, with his years of experience living in the mountains and forests, understood the mysteries of nature, and expressed the sound of mountains and waters with a sense of reality with simplified lines and the body rhythm of ink, reaching the highest realm of Chinese painting, and having a commonality with Western modern painting. Guan Liang, he understood this kind of charm in the picture and cleverly isolated it in Western paintings, creating his own style.

In order to suit his kind of expression, he began a long journey, starting from Kunming, arriving in Chongqing, traveling west to Chengdu, climbing Qingcheng, Emei, turning to the northwest, exiting Jianmen, crossing the Qinling Mountains, arriving in Chang'an, climbing Taiyi, then heading north to Lanzhou, then returning south to Xi'an, traveling east along the Longhai Line, climbing the summit of Mount Hua, exiting Hangu Pass, climbing Longmen, overlooking the scenery of the Yellow River, and then returning to Chongqing and heading south to Guiyang. His footprints almost covered all areas of the Great Rear during the Anti-Japanese War, and he also described all the famous mountains, rivers, scenic spots and wonders of these places.

After the restoration, it is difficult for people to have the opportunity to travel inland China along the highway. I think, anyone who has had this kind of experience, when they see his works, will definitely be able to evoke distant memories of passing through deep mountains and big swamps. And people who have not been there can also appreciate the great and dangerous natural realm hidden in the interior of China through his artistic expression.

### Strange Tales of Calligraphy

— Gu Xiaohu

Zhang Zhenlu of Baoshan specializes in the Eight Methods, and his cursive script is especially valued by the world. The author has long admired him, and yesterday, accompanied by a friend from the literary society, visited Zhang's residence. It happened that Zhang was writing couplets with vigorous strokes, and many people were gathered around to watch. The author expressed his intention to request calligraphy and stood by to observe. The couplets he created included true script, cursive script, clerical script, seal script, running script, and Wei script, all with new sentences attached to the name of the inscription, composing and writing without a draft.

A guest mentioned that contemporary calligraphers write cursive script with both hands. Zhang smiled, placed the couplet paper on the table, took a brush from the holder, dipped it slightly, and then operated both wrists simultaneously. He said to the people, "I have a leisure seal with the inscription 'Not saying I can do it, but willing to learn it.'"

Admiration gathered, and interest sparked. He was asked to write another couplet. Zhang easily stood to the left of the table and wrote the upper couplet sideways; then he returned to his original position and wrote the lower couplet upside down. For another couplet, he dipped the brush fully in ink and wrote quickly with his eyes closed, without any regrets for not using up all the ink, and his spirit was particularly vibrant. Zhang threw down the brush and laughed, saying that this was just an occasional game and not the proper way.

Afterward, he led the guests into a room, full of beautiful things, like an exhibition. Regarding cursive script, he said that those who followed the rules word by word, he knew to be Zhang Cao (clerical cursive); those who wrote cursive script with clerical methods, he knew to be Cao Li (cursive clerical); those who could be slightly distinguished were probably Xiao Cao (small cursive); and those who seemed mad and drunk were undoubtedly Kuang Cao (wild cursive). There was a four-panel screen, and the postures of the cursive script were all different. The characters were connected to each other, like dragons and snakes with flying white, seemingly soft and boneless but with hidden toughness. What style was this? He said it was "Tangled Vine Cursive." The strokes were discontinuous, like the clarity of bamboo, like the uprightness of stems. What school was this? He said it was "Broken Branch Cursive." Those that moved freely and reached all directions were called "Divination Cursive." Those that were like flying flowers and dancing leaves, beautiful and charming, were called "Sweeping Orchid Cursive." It was like this kind of laborious cursive script, so how could the cursive script be disrespectful!

In summary, the cursive script he created was particularly unrestrained and strange. The intentional parts were like singing and slow dancing, and the unrestrained parts were like flashing lightning and galloping wind. There were chaotic stones paved on the street, and even the dots and strokes were in a mess. Some characters seemed to want to leave the line and desert the team, and some characters even seemed to rush off the paper and fly away. There was also a character that occupied the entire line, going straight to the end to show its charm. Or there was a certain character that was repeated, but each was different in style to show his broad abilities. It was not just showing talent in cursive script, but directly using cursive script as a game! A few paintings by Zhang, with inscriptions, were interspersed on the walls. His inscription on a landscape painting said: "Real mountains and real waters are indeed good, painting water and painting mountains are even more beautiful. The pavilions and bridges are near, and the clouds and trees are far, every slope and every grass are all suitable." His inscription on a figure painting said: "This is a poet's painting, painting the meaning of painting into poetry. The reality seems to be coming out, silently entrusting longing." All of these were worth seeing.

### Full of Spring

— Zhang Mengzhao

"Meeting friends through literature, and assisting benevolence with friends," then knowing that "the friendship of gentlemen is as light as water" is possible.

An ancient poem: "Ancient people made friends with gold, if there is not much gold, the friendship is not deep, even if promises are temporarily given? They are always just the hearts of passers-by!" Quoting the past to prove the present can be said to be "a snapshot of the present!"

But after I attended the "Literary Tea Party," I felt: "The wind generates in the four seats, full of spring!" Literary friends who wield pens are all polite, elegant, and pleasant! Talking and laughing, leisurely sipping tea, without the slightest hypocrisy! Nor the slightest vulgarity! Even when choosing a seat, one must choose "taking quietness in the midst of noise!" Avoiding the hustle and bustle! This also shows the aloofness and purity of literary friends!

"Neighbors from the ends of the earth come together, and a branch of spring blooms first on the ridge." Spring in winter! On everyone's enthusiastic faces, in everyone's enthusiastic sleeves, shaking hands warmly with each other, discussing new knowledge and promoting art, men and women, young and old, all showing an enthusiasm filled with joy! To open up the flowers of literature and art! To cultivate warm friendship! This is my life's fortune! It is also the most enjoyable thing in my life! May the literary tea party, "Full of Spring," last forever!

### Angel (Part of the Epiphany)

— Li Bi

Li Bi (Filippo Lippi 1406-1469) was a painting monk in the temple at that time. His style has both the lyrical poetry of F. Angelico and the calm realism of Masaccio. He paid special attention to the treatment of light and shade and the arrangement of forms. This work was made between the ages of twenty-seven and thirty. The original painting is now in the Badi Temple in Florence, Italy, and is listed by art historians as a representative work of the late fifteenth century. (Lion)

### An Inch of Mountain, an Inch of Blood 155

— Ye Jingfeng

The swordsmen from outside were retreating in the direction of Tsurumi's arena, so the woman fighting Tsurumi, and Pingzi, also retreated with the main group. The swordsmen from Beppu, pretending to respond, followed the group of outsiders, seemingly pursuing while making noise, but not daring to get close, as if escorting them. They waited until the swordsmen retreated to the wall, some taking turns to climb over it, some covering the rear, then a part guarded on the wall, and a part climbed over the wall. Finally, those guarding on the wall also quickly left, and the people here each sighed with relief, as if a great burden had been lifted, sheathed their swords, and considered it a concluded chapter.

While putting on a show of pursuing the foreign swordsmen, Tsurumi had already somewhat understood after hearing Pingzi's words. However, wanting to see the matter through, he followed behind the pursuing group, also making noise. It seemed he didn't want those outsiders to retreat leisurely. Later, seeing that the people had all climbed over the wall and left, he asked the people around him, "What is on the other side of the wall?" "Why don't we chase after them?" The person shook his head and said, "That is a temple, with great Buddhist power. We cannot go there; the leaders do not allow us to go there."

Japan, this nation, is an inexplicable thing, full of contradictions. On one hand, some people study the latest world science, while on the other hand, they are deeply superstitious. On one hand, they are improving extremely rapidly, almost standing on the front line of the world's material civilization, while on the other hand, they are extremely conservative and stubborn. Therefore, even today, in some places, if samurai engage in械鬥, one can still see the ancient style of sword fights in forests and wild temples from hundreds of years ago. In such arenas of激鬥, if you use modern pistols, electric knives, and other equipment, you won't just be ridiculed by the enemy for being barbaric, but even your own side will feel ashamed and indignant because of you, and even commit suicide.

"Well done, Tsurumi-kun!" someone said in Tsurumi's ear, "Prime Minister is waiting for you in the hall."

Upon hearing the voice, Tsurumi immediately bowed and replied, "Understood;" thinking in his heart, "This is simply a play, a boring martial drama, let's go listen to what this fellow has to say."

"Tsurumi-kun, are you the most clear or the most unclear person about today's events?" Konoe, like in an old drama, maintaining that stylized posture, sat properly cross-legged on the low-legged bed. Tsurumi had already been granted a seat this time, the seat still being that brocade cushion. Although the electric lights had been restored, they were still not used in the hall, instead, many original Japanese-style square and round hanging lanterns were lit, making everything in the hall appear more ancient. Besides the original few serving girls, four more sword-carrying female warriors had been added, squatting in a row close to the foot of the large screen.

"... I only dare say that they did not come to duel with this humble servant alone..." Tsurumi vaguely replied.

"Very true," Konoe seemed to know what Tsurumi was about to say, "This is the third or fourth time they have caused trouble. They believe that 'Eight Corners Under One Roof' is limited to the current mainland. They are very satisfied with the status quo, even the situation before the Restoration. They say the High Pavilion is a big elephant, and Manchuria is a big bomb. They do not know the current world situation, and do not know the intensity of current competition. Because their leader once served as a minister, I did not use modern 'pistols and bombs'!"...

### The Difficulty of the Yin Pass: A Bank Manager's Confession

— Yide

A bank manager, generally speaking, is such an enviable figure. Not to mention anything else, just look at movies, where bankers are often portrayed as idols of money worship. Women pursue him, obey him, and people in society compliment and flatter him. A bank manager seems to be a representative figure of the God of Wealth, capable of making money and using money. I remember during the War of Resistance in the temporary capital, bank managers were the objects of infatuation for women. What simple officials, they didn't care about them at all, but the "bank manager" first conquered them in their minds. Cao Yu's "Sunrise," isn't it also centered around a bank manager? But let me tell you my troubles:

The Pressure of Headway

First, the pressure of balancing accounts is苦. In the past, banking had seasonality, and the tightness of headway had a fixed period, such as the tea season, silk season, cotton season... As long as you prepared in advance, you could cope with it easily when the time came. But doing banking today is like going through the New Year every day, with headway often impossible to grasp. Suddenly, it becomes so loose that you can't lend it out, "rotting" painfully, and then suddenly it becomes so tight that you have to scramble desperately, often working until late at night and still unable to "stop," so anxious that you almost want to "hang yourself." You must still remember the stories of Chen Da Silver Firm and Jian Guo Bank. The manager of Chen Da ran around digging for funds for a week, but in the end, he ended up hanging himself. You can imagine what days I went through during that week, my nerves so tense that I was about to faint, my heart pounding as if it would burst, bowing and scraping to people, looking at their faces, the mental pain and suffering that ordinary people cannot imagine, but only bank managers cannot avoid experiencing. This situation is most obvious in small banks, but now even the managers of major banks cannot avoid suffering this苦.

The Pressure of Interest Rates

Second, doing business is苦. The interest rate for deposits stipulated by the bank is 1.8% per month, and the interest rate for loans is 1.35% per month. No one outside the industry doesn't say that banks make good money. This is truly like watching a fire from across the river, unaware of the misery of the people inside. Currently, the black market interest rate, the so-called usury, is as high as 1.8% to 2.5% per month, and underground money houses are also very active. What fool would send money to the bank to leave it idle? The detachment of floating funds from banks has a long history, and it is even more so today. Term deposits are even less to be said, and even demand deposits are extremely rare. Now, the meager funds that banks rely on are mostly the demand deposit balances of scattered retail customers. This is thanks to the inconvenience of cash turnover. Generally, merchants must open an account to use checks. Thus, today they deposit five million, and tomorrow or even "use it on the same day" for four million nine hundred thousand, but there is still a balance of one hundred thousand in the account. The bank relies on thousands or even tens of thousands of hundreds of thousands to form a lump sum for turnover and use. Its internal emptiness and the difficulty of operation are like a candle in the wind, a tower on the sand, truly unable to withstand wind and waves and blows.

Furthermore, out of this meager total amount, the central bank must take 20% as a "deposit reserve," and the bank itself must set aside 30% as a "cash reserve." In this way, 50% is set aside, and only 50% can be used. Using this 50% of funds to operate lending, exchange, and other businesses, we also have to deduct the bad debts, defaults, and other possible risks. To make money to pay for huge expenses and taxes, how can it be easy!

The most headache is "same-day use." To avoid eating up the call money interest, we demand that the check be deposited on the same day when opening an account. Before the exchange is revealed, we must first allow the use of the funds, otherwise, we will not open a deposit account. This method is limitlessly risky. Our own headway has been used up by others, and once the check they deposited bounces, how can this money be recovered? Recently, a certain major bank had such a thing happen. The money was used up by others, and the person also disappeared. You can imagine how difficult it is to do banking.

Third, dealing with people is苦. If a bank manager doesn't accommodate, people will scold you for being rigid, saying you have a "south-facing face," and simply stop doing business with you. If you are too sentimental, you will still be the one who suffers. If the customer doesn't understand the procedures, they will always hate you for being verbose. Once the money is out of your hands, and a problem arises, your difficulties immediately come. The difficulty of collecting debts is known to everyone. Especially in this year, usury is a public fact, but the court still doesn't protect you. You can't be too forceful, but you can't be too soft either. You can imagine how difficult this negotiation is. Dealing with people is the most painful thing there is. When your own headway is "short," that is your unlucky moment. You make phone calls one after another, begging and thanking a thousand or ten thousand times. But if you want wind, the wind doesn't come, and if you want rain, the rain doesn't come. If you haven't dealt with people properly in the past, and your relationship isn't close, who will care about your difficulties, who will save your life? How can outsiders understand the subtleties and complexities of this?

Therefore, please don't compliment bank managers anymore. If "Wu Zixu Crossing the Pass" is the most painful play, then I am singing the play of crossing the pass every day. Look, my hair has turned white with worry.

In this era, I really don't know who is living a happy life!

### "Waves Wash Sand"

— Jing

A Doggerel Verse at the End of the Year

The child cries, the wife wails,

Prices rise day by day,

Full of worries,

How to get through the end of the year?

Years pass like a dream,

Only now do I realize.

As if losing parents,

Why doesn't heaven drop gold ingots?

The poor suffer during the New Year,

Money is lacking!

(Tune: Quechou)

### In the Barber Shop: Leisurely People, Worldly Attitudes, Human Flavors

Yesterday I went to the barber shop for a haircut and saw that every barber was more attentive than usual. Why? I wondered. After the haircut, when they put my coat on, they had a smiling face, always facing me. That kind of politeness made me feel flattered. When I took out half of a stack of ten thousand yuan bills to give him, he bowed slightly, again with a smiling face, and said: "Sir, the haircut fee is doubled from the Small New Year's Eve? It's always like this every year, nine thousand yuan is enough." Oh! Nine thousand yuan, my heart trembled, and I had to slowly count four more bills and handed them to him, just as I was about to leave, he made a face at his companion, and then tugged at my sleeve, and said softly, "Sir, a tip..." Right, I haven't given a tip yet? So I had to give him the only remaining bill in this stack of banknotes. I ran out the door at a rapid pace, almost hitting my head on the door, and was about to go back, a burst of laughter passed through my eardrums and into my heart, they were clearly mocking me, I was extremely annoyed!

I believe that a haircut for ten thousand yuan is too much for nine out of ten people to bear, when I touch my head, an annoying smiling face appears immediately, I am angry again, hair! Hair! Don't be like corrupt officials who only care about climbing up and neglect the people below, this demon cannot be completely killed by ordinary machines, but beware, one day there will be a sharp weapon to cut you off, and without you, you can reduce a great burden.

### Seeking Good Luck

— Ye Cao

In the past, wealthy families all hired private tutors, and the compensation was very generous. When the lunar New Year came, the private tutor felt very panicked, because they didn't know whether they would be re-hired next year, so at the turn of the year, they especially wanted to seek good luck from many small actions, and hated to hear signals of dismissal.

In a certain place, there was an old gentleman who was a leading figure in this type of person, and he was stubborn and superstitious. On New Year's Eve, the old gentleman was in a good mood, lit candles and went to bed, instructing the servant before going to sleep to put a lot of "cakes" under his pillow. "What is this thing?" the servant asked. "(High) pillow without worry!" The old gentleman had ulterior motives. Then he lay down, and the old gentleman ordered the servant to place a "chicken egg" on his chest; "What is that for?" "(But) relax!" The old gentleman always remembered his job problem, and used auspicious words to comfort himself.

The candle of keeping watch over the New Year burned to the end, and New Year's Day arrived. The old gentleman woke up groggily, ah! The egg on his chest was gone. He hurriedly called the servant.

"Sir! It's gone!" The servant pointed to a messy pool on the floor, it turned out that the chicken egg had fallen to the ground at some point when the old man turned over.

The servant originally blurted it out unintentionally, but the old gentleman thought it was very unlucky, and was extremely frustrated, lacking energy.

Sure enough, the master saw that the private tutor was dazed and answered irrelevantly, and dismissed him before the fifth day of the New Year.

### Occasional Notes

— Xiao Kangshi

At the end of this year and the beginning of the new year, most bosses feel a shortage of funds and poor turnover; however, the pockets of workers in general factories, and the drivers, nannies, and maids of middle and upper class families, are quite well-off.

For example, the salaries of workers in factories are calculated according to the cost of living index. They live frugally on weekdays, and their income and expenditure situation is much better than that of civil servants. At the end of this lunar year, they also received "double pay" or "year-end bonus," so of course they are having a better time.

As for "servants," the masters are busy with social engagements and sending New Year's gifts, there is a "commission" of up to 20%, so the wider the circle of acquaintances, the more considerable the income. During the New Year, relatives and friends of the master come to pay New Year's greetings, and give "lotus seed soup" and "yuanbao tea." The income of servants in middle-class families is also very considerable, not to mention wealthy families. Although this huge income requires hard work for a whole "year," they don't worry about food and clothing at ordinary times, and there are very few additional expenses, so the end of the year and the beginning of the new year is the most auspicious time for them to "make money!"

The income of the general "workers" and "servants" at the end of the year and the beginning of the new year is "extra" money. Before the war, they took it to the countryside to buy land, but it is not the case after the war. Farming is not profitable, so some "lend it out for interest." However, in recent years, prices have soared and the currency has depreciated, so they have shifted their focus again. Some hoard daily necessities, while most are vying to exchange for "gold jewelry" in silver shops, to preserve their year's "hard work" and prevent private property from being "lost" due to currency devaluation!

Therefore: The business of large and small silver shops in Shanghai is booming, especially during the half month of the "New Year." The bosses and employees are extremely busy, welcoming these customers with "New Year's joy." Don't think that they are small customers, in terms of the "profit" and "weight" of transactions. Little by little, it really is a "good business"! Therefore, when the accounts are closed at the end of the lunar New Year, the "bonuses" received by the employees of several large silver shops are calculated in "strips" (gold bars). In today's world, only silver shops can be considered "heaven's darlings." This is a huge opportunity given by "currency devaluation!"

In this New Year, drivers, nannies... and silver shop employees are all delighted, while other industries are mostly worried, complaining, and lamenting poverty!

### Collective Debt Collection

— Fang Wen

The end of the year is approaching, people owe each other debts, and as usual, they have to be cleared. Therefore, more than a thousand Chinese employees of the former 工部局 held two collective debt collections in this urgent and dying year.

This old debt (savings, retirement pay, pension money) has as many as thousands of creditors, and the time is separated by the eight years of the War of Resistance, and it is also entangled with some international relations, so that after more than a year of debt collection, the debtors on the opposite side have not been found, which has made these thousands of creditors anxious and waiting to die. Some have thrown themselves into the river, and some have hanged themselves.

Fortunately, during the second collective debt collection a few days ago, the mayor personally came forward and explained in public that the property rights and debts of the former concession had been transferred to the municipal government, and personally admitted that the municipal government was the debtor "with a grievance, there is a head, and with a debt, there is a master." After finding the debtor, it was finally a reassurance for thousands of creditors!

In the end, more than a thousand creditors in the collective debt collection publicly elected the mayor as the general representative for debt collection. The mayor is a mayor, and his position was originally the representative of the debtors. In this way, he became the representative of the creditors. This mayor, who holds both parties' representative positions, has to represent the municipal government to pay off this old debt on the one hand, and represent the Chinese employees to recover this old debt on the other hand, and seems to be doing another "sandwich"!

The representative of the debtors of this old debt is the mayor, and the representative of the creditors is also the mayor. In the future, when repaying the debt, the procedures can be greatly simplified. Let's wait!

### Philosophical Miscellany

— Qi

Candle

It also melts its whole body's energy to give off light and heat. But when its energy is too abundant, and the light and heat it emits is always so little, it will quietly shed tears.

Cigarette Butt

It is most intimate with you, but you often abandon it so cruelly, sometimes even stepping on it, crushing it to pieces, losing the residual heat of life.

Firecracker

The fate of a lifetime is only to rise up for a moment, to make a sound, after which it no longer exists.

Fountain Pen

It doesn't necessarily have to be full to be driven by you and work well. If it is completely empty, then it will give you a blank look and there will be no follow-up.

Drum

There is nothing inside the belly, but the sound is deafening when it speaks. A detestable thing!

Glasses

The most absurd thing we do is this, because our eyes can't see external things clearly, but we still want to put something on our eyes to cover them.

### The Central Figure in the Northeast Situation: Some Anecdotes about Xiong Shihui

— Dunfu

Xiong Shihui, the director of the Northeast 行辕, left Shenyang for Peiping on the 9th of this month, and went to Beijing on the 11th to report on the military and political situation in the Northeast to the Chairman, and to ask the Central Government for instructions on the handling of Northeast diplomacy, especially the Dalian issue. These two days, Xiong has been in frequent contact in the capital and is very busy. On the one hand, people in the Northeast are expecting Xiong to bring new improvements to the local area after his return.

Speaking of Xiong Shihui, everyone knows that he used to be the Chairman of Jiangxi Province, and was famous for his "hard work," "practical work," and "quick work." At that time, the 共軍 in Jiangxi was entrenched, the official history was corrupt, and the provincial administration was hesitating at a crossroads. Since Xiong took office, Jiangxi's politics began to get on track. It is said that at that time, this Chairman Xiong often wore a blue cloth gown and went to the countryside to secretly investigate, and if he found any long-standing malpractices, he would decisively deal with them. A certain Ji Wei director in Yushan County embezzled donations, and Xiong executed him immediately after discovering it.

Xiong himself is from Jiangxi, and he has his own unique way of governing Jiangxi. He was originally a soldier and had attended military school in Japan. After the victory of the War of Resistance, he was ordered to be transferred to the Northeast 行辕, which shows the importance attached to him by the Central Government.

Anyone who has ever come into contact with Xiong, or who has read Xiong's articles, must know that although Xiong is brave and good at fighting, he is actually a scholar. He loves books and paintings, and reads and paints in his spare time, pursuing his elegant life. I remember once when Xiong returned from a visit to Longhua in Shanghai to see the peach blossoms, he wrote a seven-character quatrain:

He always carries the Peiwun Rhyme Dictionary with him, and spends his free time studying it. Every morning, Xiong practices swordsmanship for half an hour, making him a Confucian general and admirable.

"Peach blossoms are like burning water and like oil, tourists fight in the valley, the most beautiful is the March road of Longhua, fragrant dust first floods the temple bell tower."

In Xiong's life, there are two dangerous things worth noting: one was when he led his troops to pursue Sun Chuanfang in Yishui during the Northern Expedition, and went deep into enemy territory, almost reaching a desperate situation; the other was when Xiong's plane crashed to the ground, but Xiong was lucky enough not to share the same fate as the passengers of the recently crashed China Aviation aircraft, extremely dangerous!

A soldier like Xiong, who is familiar with politics and diplomacy and also proficient in poetry and painting, is really rare in China.
