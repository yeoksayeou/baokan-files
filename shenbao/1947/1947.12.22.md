### This Year's Constitution Implementation to Begin on Christmas Day; Chairman Broadcasts Encouragement to All Citizens to Jointly Strive to Build a New China

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 21st] At the request of the Shanghai Gospel Broadcasting Station, Chairman Chiang delivered a Christmas Day broadcast at 9:00 PM on the 21st. The Chairman's speech was recorded in Nanjing one day prior and sent to Shanghai for broadcast by the station.

The final section of the Chairman's speech stated: This Christmas, our China will begin to implement a new democratic constitution. This will be the day when the Republic of China and all its people will begin a new era of unity, independence, equality, and freedom. He also said: We believe that the implementation of the new constitution is only the initial step in achieving our ultimate goal of building a new China. However, this represents an epoch-making progress for China's three thousand years of autocratic rule and for building society. I hope that all our compatriots, with faith and sincerity, will work together to move forward. I believe that we will soon be able to complete our predetermined journey, which is to build our Three Principles of the People's New China. The full text of the speech is as follows:

Fellow countrymen across the country: This week, the whole world is celebrating the joyous festival of the birth of Jesus, the Gospel of mankind. Therefore, everyone's emotions are focused on love and peace among mankind. All the unstable and unpleasant atmosphere in the world seems to have diminished during this period.

During this joyous festival for the whole world, our Chinese compatriots should also feel happy and gratified for the blessing of Christ's birth, saving people and saving the world, just like other countries. All our compatriots, regardless of what religion they believe in, regardless of what occupation they engage in, welcome the two lofty ideals symbolized by the birth of Christ: "World Peace" and "Universal Love." We believe that many of the evils and problems in the world today can only find solutions from this ideal.

It is often said that the time in a year to express the spirit of Christ is too short. There is no way to make every day of the 365 days of the year so happy and joyous. This is a great regret for mankind.

### Every Christmas, We Should Examine Our Own Lives; The Whole World Needs the Inspiration of the Spirit of Christ

But in my opinion, Christmas has a greater significance for people:

The arrival of Christmas every year provides us with the best opportunity for self-reflection in the year, to sincerely examine our own lives. How much work have we done for the country, for our compatriots, and for the people of the world during this year? When we face the great fact of Christ's birth, we should think about the following question: Do our lives and work match the lofty ideals of this savior? Are we truly striving to create the peaceful world revealed by Christ's spirit of willingly sacrificing himself for the sins of others?

This question has the same profound meaning for our national life and for our personal lives. Because national life is the expansion of personal life. At a time when unstable factors still exist in the international community and mankind is suffering from pain, bewilderment, and trials, each of us, our entire world, urgently needs the inspiration of the spirit of Christ.

### Understanding the Truth of Christ

If we can use the eyes of Christian faith to observe the current world situation, then the chaotic and dark phenomena we see can immediately be revealed as bright. Here we can know that any humiliation, any suffering, is an inevitable experience for our country in the long journey of self-reliance. Amidst the various pains and difficulties that China encounters today, we must also truly understand the truth of Christ's salvation: "Conquering evil with righteousness" and "Overcoming evil with good." Then, with an indomitable spirit, without hesitation, and without wavering, we can move forward bravely. There is no difficult problem that cannot be solved, and there is no painful problem that cannot be overcome. Whether it is national unification or the happiness of the people, as long as we strive and struggle according to this truth and faith, there is no reason why we cannot achieve our goals. As long as we have such confidence, we can be a hundred times more courageous in any dangerous and painful environment. Our country and our nation will naturally be reborn from the joint struggle and sacrifice of all our compatriots, and become a greater country and a more glorious nation.

The Jesus Christ we now commemorate, his understanding of human suffering, no one can compare with him in the past and present. His life was subjected to the most severe persecution. He was insulted by his countrymen and abandoned by his relatives and friends. If we measure Christ's career in the world by the standards of worldly success or failure, it can be said to be the greatest failure. However, his final success is so great! How brilliant it is for him to defeat those who persecuted him and slandered him in terms of justice and righteousness! We now know that his strength comes from such torment and sacrifice.

### US Aid to China Association Formulates Work Plan for Next Year; Hopes Children's Welfare Experts Will Go to the United States for Research

[Central News Agency, New York, 20th] The United China Relief is the largest private organization in the United States aimed at helping China help itself. Although the results of the association's fundraising activities this year were not very good, it has now formulated a plan to promote work in China in 1948.

The United China Relief's plan depends entirely on the amount of funds raised by the American Committee for Foreign Aid next year. The special plans that the association intends to expand, in terms of social welfare, is to expand the United China Relief's work in training children's welfare talents, hoping that ten Chinese children's welfare experts can come to the United States for further study next year. In terms of mass education, expand the economic and social reconstruction work currently being carried out by the Mass Education Movement Committee in Bishan, Sichuan.

### Bandits Attempt to Harass the Dahongshan Area; Military Situation in Northern Hubei Gradually Becomes Tense; National Army in Eastern Henan Meets on the Tongxu and Kaifeng Roads

[Our newspaper, Hankou, 21st] The military situation in northern Hubei is slightly tense. The signs of communist bandits harassing the Dahongshan area are becoming more and more obvious.

### Many Factories and Mines in the Northeast Are Shut Down Due to Lack of Coal and Electricity and Loss of Communication; Sun Yueqi Arrives in Peiping and Says That the Transportation of Machines South Is Not Accurate

[Our newspaper, Shenyang, 21st] The mines of the National Resources Commission have become satellites of Shenyang, isolated and losing contact with each other. The textile, paper, cement, and oil refining factories in Liaoning are closed due to lack of coal and electricity. There is a severe shortage of food and funds in the mines. For example, Anshan and Benxi only have enough food for a few days, and Fuxin and Beipiao need to have banknotes airdropped to maintain them. It is particularly heartbreaking that the employees who escaped from the Yantai coal mine do not have time to be rescued. Looking at the mines, they are full of scars. The problem in the future is not a production problem but a survival problem.

[Our newspaper, Peiping, 21st] Sun Yueqi, Deputy Director of the National Resources Commission, arrived in Peiping by military plane from Shenyang at 6:00 PM today. Sun met with reporters and said: The maintenance of industries and mines in the Northeast is extremely difficult. During his month or so in Shenyang, in addition to inspecting the mines and factories to express his spiritual comfort to the employees working hard, he also discussed the issue of maintaining industrial and mining strongholds with Director Chen Jian many times. Chen understood the difficulties very well and promised to do his best to protect the industries and mines, but sometimes it was impossible due to factual constraints. The rumors that he arranged for the dismantling of important machines before the freeze and transporting them south are completely inaccurate. In fact, it is not possible. At present, each factory and mine still has 120,000 to 130,000 employees, with staff accounting for one-tenth, and there is no problem in controlling the workers. Sun also talked about the situation of each factory and mine, saying: Fushun can still generate 30,000 kilowatts, transmit 4,000 kilowatts to Pan, and use more than 3,000 tons of coal, but it is encountering economic bankruptcy and serious engineering risks; Benxi is isolated, and its second power plant has recently been completed, generating a total of 10,000 kilowatts; Anshan has been trapped, and some of the inventory has been shipped out first. Now due to the lack of coal, only part of the work is being done, and steelmaking has been stopped. The five locomotives and 100 carriages produced by the Fanyang Locomotive Factory have been sold to the Ministry of Transportation for cash, and two more machines are now being made; the personnel of the Fuxin mine are all trapped inside, and the personnel of Beipiao have arrived in Jinzhou. The Dalinghe Paper Mill was destroyed in this battle. Sun will stay in Peiping for four or five days before returning south.

### Bandits in Northern Jiangsu Disguised as Grain Merchants Are Active Along the Beijing-Shanghai Line; Military Authorities Order Strict Precautions

[Our newspaper, Zhenjiang, 21st] In order to spy on our military and political situation, the bandits in northern Jiangsu have recently disguised themselves as grain merchants and transported food such as rice, wheat, and soybeans to major cities along the Beijing-Shanghai line for activities. The military authorities have telegraphed each county and city to take strict precautions. In addition, in order to suppress grain prices in various counties and prevent bandits from taking the opportunity to stir up unrest, the Jiangsu Provincial Government has specially ordered each county to pay attention to this matter.

### Shenyang Outskirts Within a Hundred Miles Free of Bandits; Liaoxi Contends for Xinlitun; Zheng Dongguo Again Visited the Chairman Yesterday to Receive Instructions

[This Newspaper Shenyang 21st Dispatch] Shenyang still heard artillery fire from afar before dawn on the 21st. The weather is getting better, and the sound of planes is incessant, with frequent sorties. However, food prices are soaring, causing considerable hardship for the people. A major battle is brewing in the Xinmin area, with the bandits continuing to concentrate forces in the region. The bandit 9th Column is already near Xinmin, the 4th Column is detouring south of Shenyang, the 3rd Column is advancing westward from Zhonggu in northern Liaoning, and the 1st Column is attempting to approach Xinmin from the north via Tongjiangkou in a roundabout way. The 10th Column is currently in the Zhangwu and Faku area, and the 8th Column is fiercely attacking Xinlitun west of Xinmin, attempting to seize Xinlitun and then advance on Xinmin. In this way, there will be five columns of bandit forces, and it is expected that a major battle will occur within the week.

[Another Dispatch] Fierce fighting for Xinlitun is in progress, with the National Army now gaining the upper hand. Furthermore, Beizhen (north of Goubangzi) was recaptured by the National Army at 8:00 AM on the 20th, with the remaining bandits fleeing in disarray. There are no longer any bandit traces in the surrounding area.

[Central News Agency Qingyang 21st Dispatch] The bandit 19th Division and other units, which invaded the outskirts of Qianyang and the Buddhist Temple (35 kilometers north of Shenyang), have suffered heavy casualties after being severely attacked by the National Army. They have scattered and fled towards Jiumen and other places on the north bank of the Liao River. The National Army is currently pursuing the remaining bandits. In addition, scattered bandits near the Shahe Railway Station (30 kilometers south of Shenyang) have also been surrounded by the National Army.

[Another Dispatch] There are no bandit traces within 50 kilometers of the outskirts of Fanyang. The heroic National Army has been swiftly defeating stubborn enemies in recent days, giving great excitement to the military and civilians here. The Shenyang Northern National Army, pursuing and suppressing the remaining bandits, has now crossed the frozen Liao River and recovered Jiumen (60 kilometers north of Panbei). Scattered bandits near Shahe Railway Station, 30 kilometers south of Shenyang, have suffered heavy casualties after being encircled and suppressed by the National Army, and their remnants are fleeing south and northwest of the area. National Army units from Liaoyang and Fushun have dispatched troops to create a screen, joining forces at Huazigou, 20 kilometers northeast of Liaoyang. The remnants of the bandit 4th Column are fleeing westward along a long line, and the National Army is currently intercepting them in the Shen Danbao area (20 kilometers east of Liaoyang).

[This Newspaper Beiping 21st Dispatch] It is reported that a strong force from the Training and Conscription Department again passed through the Beining Line yesterday to reinforce the Northeast. The Ping-Yu trains on the Beining Line were running smoothly yesterday and today, and rumors of another interruption are inaccurate.

[This Newspaper Nanjing 21st Dispatch] Zheng Dongguo again visited the Chairman at 10:00 AM on the 21st to receive instructions regarding the Northeast war situation. At 12:00 PM, he attended a luncheon hosted by Minister Yu Feipeng. Zheng spent the entire day today consulting with senior officials of the Ministry of National Defense on the Northeast war situation, and had not yet returned to his residence late into the night.

Editorial

### America's Long-Term Aid to Europe Plan

After the U.S. Congress finally completed the legislation for the emergency foreign aid plan, it adjourned on the 19th and will reconvene on January 6th of next year. President Truman, in the last moment before the congressional adjournment, proposed a long-term aid to Europe plan, a document of over nine thousand words. Besides explaining that the U.S. assistance to European countries' reconstruction is fully in line with the spirit of the United Nations Charter, it also pointed out the conditions attached to the U.S. aid to European countries. President Truman's article, although to be left for Congress to discuss next year, has significant implications and is indeed a major event in international politics at the end of 1947. Britain, France, and other countries have expressed enthusiastic welcome, and it can be seen as the starting point for the transition from 1947 to 1948.

The U.S. aid to Europe's reconstruction plan was first proposed by Secretary of State Marshall in a speech at Harvard University on June 15th. Initially, it held great hope to include the Soviet Union as one of the recipient countries. However, the result of the Paris Conference was that not only did the Soviet Union resolutely oppose the U.S. aid, but some small countries under Soviet control also refused to accept U.S. aid. Therefore, the U.S. aid to Europe plan fell into a state of stagnation and has not been materialized until now. In these five or six months, we have only seen the preliminary work of the U.S. President Truman appointed three committees to study U.S. resources and its ability to aid Europe, and sent Harry to investigate the actual needs of Europe. Later, Harry submitted a report arguing that the aid to Europe fund should be between 12 billion and 17 billion U.S. dollars. Secretary of State Marshall, based on estimates from various parties, announced on November 10th that the aid to Europe fund should be between 16 billion and 20 billion U.S. dollars. The Economic Cooperation Committee organized by sixteen European countries submitted a report to the U.S. government in late September, stating that if the U.S. could assist in their reconstruction, the sixteen European countries could do the following four things: Strive to increase production; Try to maintain the stability of domestic finance and fiscal policy; Ensure that all countries continue to cooperate; Increase exports to the U.S. In this way, Europe can be self-sufficient within four years without relying on aid from other countries.

Therefore, although the call for U.S. aid to Europe has been clamorous, it has been delayed in implementation. The economic crises in Western European countries, especially Italy and France, are becoming increasingly dangerous. If comprehensive assistance is not provided immediately, economic instability will inevitably lead to political turmoil. President Truman, aware of this, decided to convene a special session of Congress to discuss the emergency aid to Europe plan. Congress convened a special session on November 16th, and President Truman immediately sent a message to Congress requesting an appropriation of 597 million U.S. dollars as an emergency aid fund for France, Italy, and Austria. After a month of intense discussion, this emergency foreign aid bill was finally amended and passed by both houses and has been signed into law by President Truman. Although there are differences from the original plan, there are no major discrepancies. However, Europe cannot be reconstructed solely with this emergency foreign aid bill. Therefore, President Truman went a step further and proposed this long-term aid to Europe plan, advocating an appropriation of 15.1 billion to 17 billion U.S. dollars to aid sixteen European countries for a period of four years, ensuring that all sixteen European countries can be reconstructed, thereby guaranteeing that a third world war will never happen. Therefore, no matter from which perspective we observe, this long-term aid to Europe plan will have a very significant impact on the development of the U.S. political situation and the trends of the entire world situation in the future. It is indeed worthy of our attention.

From the perspective of the world situation, the U.S. long-term aid to Europe plan seems to be America's generosity, not hesitating to use tens of billions of dollars to aid the reconstruction of sixteen European countries, thereby guaranteeing that a third world war will not happen. However, in reality, it has other functions: First, to stabilize the economy of Western Europe, so that the sixteen European countries can be economically self-sufficient and will not encounter the hardship of starvation again. In this way, each country can maintain its independence and integrity, and will not fall under the control of other countries. Second, to avoid economic panic in the U.S. It is well known that the foundation of U.S. economic prosperity is entirely based on its overseas markets. "The world is poor while America is rich alone" is absolutely impossible. If an economic panic occurs in Europe, it will inevitably affect U.S. industry and commerce. Now the economies of the sixteen European countries are on the verge of bankruptcy. If the U.S. does not provide timely assistance to turn the tide, an economic panic in the U.S. will eventually occur one day. In other words, the U.S. must help European countries recover in order to avoid economic panic at home. Therefore, some say that U.S. aid to Europe is equivalent to self-help, which has considerable reason.

However, the crux of today's world problems, in a nutshell, lies in the incompatibility between the U.S. and the Soviet Union. The only winning card in the Soviet Union's hand is to wait for an economic panic to occur in the world. Once an economic panic occurs in Europe, the Soviet Union's forces can take advantage of the situation, and the Soviet Union's ambitions can continue to shift westward. If the U.S. suffers a recession due to the economic panic in Europe, the Soviet Union will not find it difficult to defeat the U.S. On the other hand, the U.S., with its current manpower and material resources, has more than enough to deal with the Soviet Union. However, what the U.S. fears most is an economic panic. If the European economy cannot recover, there is no peace to speak of, let alone permanent peace. If, unfortunately, the huge wave of the world economic panic spreads to the U.S., the U.S. will be overwhelmed and will be forced to give up its responsibility to lead the world in creating peace. Therefore, between the U.S. and the Soviet Union today, not only has a "cold war" broken out, but also the so-called "economic war" has become increasingly fierce. The battlefield for both sides is in Europe today. The U.S. wants to help Europe and prevent an economic panic in Europe, but the Soviet Union wants to obstruct it by any means. The Soviet Union suddenly organized a new Communist International in Warsaw, with the purpose of inciting the people of European countries to unanimously oppose U.S. aid, so that the U.S. aid to Europe plan cannot be realized. The Soviet Union also adopted an uncompromising attitude in the recent London Foreign Ministers Conference, even causing the four foreign ministers to break up unhappily, with the effect of obstructing the unification and reconstruction of the European economy. Furthermore, the Soviet Union's currency reform this time also contains the effect of strengthening the Soviet economic bloc. Therefore, the proposal of the U.S. long-term aid to Europe plan will inevitably cause a backlash from the Soviet Union. It is expected that the political struggle between the U.S. and the Soviet Union will become more heated.

From the perspective of the U.S. domestic political situation, if President Truman's proposal can be passed by Congress and effectively implemented, it will not only revive the European economy, but also avoid a U.S. economic panic. Then President Truman's achievements can be compared with those of the late President Roosevelt. In next year's presidential election, Truman will have such a large capital, and victory is within reach. Truman's intention must be seen through by the Republican Party, so it is expected that after Congress reconvenes in January next year, the U.S. party struggle will inevitably become more acute.

### The Chairman's Christmas Broadcast Speech (Continued from Page 1)

In the past decade, our compatriots throughout the country have tasted the pain of war and banditry, and have recognized the true meaning of national hardship and difficulty. Our country has suffered such incalculable destruction, our nation has been subjected to such vicious slander, our motives have been misunderstood, and our lives and actions have even been maliciously propagandized and exaggerated to have no trace of fact. Our government, officers, soldiers, and civil servants have been openly insulted in the country and abroad by those who undermine unity, regardless of national independence and freedom—traitors, communist bandits, and others—using various despicable propaganda methods to injure the personality of our entire nation.

Must Pay the Price

But these immoral and shady, treacherous environments cannot discourage us. Because we know that these insults are the price we must pay in building a greater and more perfect Christian, people-owned, people-governed, people-enjoyed, Three Principles of the People, New China. If there were no painful and dark side, there would be no such thing as happiness and light in life. We know that the nation and the people, in such a tragic ordeal, have received true refinement. Our pain gives us the vitality and experience of rebirth, which will enable our nation to overcome all the current difficulties and reach the end of victory.

With this understanding, this belief, we can see Jesus Christ, who has endured all hardships and finally won victory, standing before us, acting as a bright light guiding our country, encouraging our rebirth.

Christians in China and around the world, watching all mankind after the war revolving in a wave of widespread disappointment and moral depravity, all feel very depressed and pessimistic. In the past, in times of war and suffering, people were still able to continue to support themselves and fight to the end because they idealized a more perfect world. But now, people everywhere are wondering what work we can do in this world, which is still full of war and conquest and the idea of endurance, to ensure human happiness and world peace, and to realize our inherent ideals?

The Central Question of Our Time

Christians should have an answer to this central question of our time.

I think this answer can be found in human nature. People often become disappointed because their ideals have not been achieved. This is because their personalities cannot withstand the tempering of history, so they often repeat the same mistakes they have made before, and the same sins of the past reappear in an intensified form. People seem to be doomed to be forever trapped in a vortex of baseness and selfishness, unable to transcend. Is there a way for us to transcend this unfortunate fate? I can answer with certainty: "Of course there is." Christianity shows us a path. Christianity believes that human nature can be improved. This faith is the pointer to the future of human hope, and it is also the transformation of the world that must start with the improvement of people's hearts. If we have a better life, we will naturally have a more perfect world. If we do not cheer up because of the threat of sin and the rampant spread of sin in the world, and gradually become mentally depressed, physically and mentally numb, and even abandon ourselves, then it is because we lack faith in life. And this faith is the greatest lesson that Jesus Christ gives us, and it is also the greatest power. This is really the main vitality for us to overcome all sins. Jesus Christ said, "As long as you have faith like a mustard seed, your power can move mountains and overturn the sea." The world and mankind today are struggling under the pressure of pain and sin. The world needs this kind of faith very much, and Jesus Christ is the one who brings this faith to our wandering and pessimistic world to save us from human suffering.

The Dawn of a New Opportunity

When I think of this year's Christmas, I think of our China starting to implement the new democratic constitution on this festive day. I think this commemoration is very precious. The 36th year of the Republic of China, that is, the Christmas of 1947, the year of Jesus' birth, will be the day when our Republic of China and all its people are unified, independent, equal, free, and the dawn of a new opportunity begins. The characteristic of our new constitution is that it guarantees to give all our compatriots the basic elements of Christian principles, namely personal dignity and freedom, universally. This new constitution confirms the various freedoms and rights of the people of the whole country. It is conceived and born in the spirit of a free people under national unity and freedom.

We believe that the implementation of the new constitution is only the first step in completing our ultimate goal of building a New China. But this is an epoch-making progress for our China's three thousand years of autocratic political system and feudal society. I hope that our compatriots across the country will work together with faith and piety. I believe that we will soon be able to complete our predetermined journey, which is the completion of the establishment of our New China based on the Three Principles of the People.

This is a little bit of what I want to contribute and hope for to our compatriots across the country and people of the world this Christmas. (The End)

### Papal Nuncio Launches 140 Bishops to Hold Special Prayers for Me

[United Press Nanjing 21st] The Papal Nuncio, Libero, today sent a letter to 140 bishops stationed in China, requesting them to hold special prayers for China on Christmas. It is said that the Japanese Church solemnly celebrates the birth of Christ, and is very gratified that it coincides with China's implementation of the new constitution. Chinese Catholics cannot ignore this major event, because at that time, the Chinese people will begin a new era. Our responsibility is to ask Christ to bestow peace and prosperity on this noble country, and to lead it to follow the right path to gain freedom and happiness.

[Our Newspaper Guangzhou 21st Dispatch] The Guangdong Provincial Assembly, in order to thoroughly investigate the corruption case of the Guangdong Relief Sub-bureau, has telegraphed the Executive Yuan to request a thorough investigation, and listed the following evidence of corruption in the bureau: (A) monopolizing transportation, falsely reporting losses, and colluding with merchants to steal and sell supplies, worth 1 billion yuan six months ago.

### Verdict Text of Three War Criminals in the Murder Competition: Mukai, Noda, Tanaka

[Our Newspaper Dispatch] Mukai Toshiaki, Noda Takeshi, and Tanaka Gunkichi, the Japanese war criminals involved in the Nanjing Massacre murder competition case, were each sentenced to death by the Military Tribunal for the Trial of War Criminals of the Ministry of National Defense on the 18th of this month. The full text of the verdict is as follows: Verdict of the Military Tribunal for the Trial of War Criminals of the Ministry of National Defense: Defendant Mukai Toshiaki, male, 36 years old, from Yamaguchi Prefecture, Japan, artillery squad leader. Noda Takeshi (i.e., Noda Iwao), 35 years old, from Kagoshima Prefecture, Japan, adjutant of the Toyama Battalion of the 16th Division of the Japanese Army. Tanaka Gunkichi, male, 43 years old, from Tokyo, Japan, company commander of the 45th Regiment of the 6th Division of the Japanese Army.

The right defendants, due to war crimes, were prosecuted by the prosecutor of this court, and this court rules as follows:

Main Text

Mukai Toshiaki, Noda Iwao, and Tanaka Gunkichi, during the war, jointly and deliberately slaughtered prisoners of war and non-combatants, and are each sentenced to death.

Facts

Mukai Toshiaki and Noda Iwao, during the war, belonged to the Nakajima Unit of the 16th Division of the Japanese Army, serving as second lieutenant squad leader and adjutant respectively. Tanaka Gunkichi belonged to the Tani Hisao Unit of the 6th Division, serving as a captain company commander. During the battle to attack Nanjing in December of the 26th year of the Republic of China (1937), due to encountering strong resistance from our army, they harbored resentment and carried out a planned massacre to vent their anger. Tanaka Gunkichi used a "Joseon sword" in the southwestern suburbs of Nanjing to kill more than 300 prisoners of war and non-combatants. Mukai Toshiaki and Noda Iwao held a competition for entertainment in the foothills of Zijin Mountain, competing on the number of people killed. Each wielded sharp blades, killing anyone they encountered, regardless of age. As a result, Noda Iwao stabbed to death 105 people, while Mukai Toshiaki won by killing 106 people. After Japan's surrender, Noda Iwao and others were successively arrested in Tokyo by the Allied Headquarters and sent to Nanjing by our delegation to Japan for investigation and prosecution by the prosecutor of this court.

Reasoning

The facts that the defendants Mukai Toshiaki and Noda Iwao, during the battle to attack Nanjing, held a competition in the foothills of Zijin Mountain to massacre prisoners of war and non-combatants, and that Noda Iwao killed a total of 105 people, while Mukai Toshiaki won by killing 106 people, were detailed in "Japanese Atrocities Documented" by the foreign reporter Timperley, who was in Nanjing at the time. This aligns with the "Tokyo Nichi Nichi Shimbun" seized by the Chinese Prosecutor's Office of the Far East International Military Tribunal, which reported on how the defendants held a "killing one hundred people" competition in Zijin Mountain and how, after completing the massacre and exceeding the record, they each raised their bloody swords, smiled at each other, and discussed the outcome. There are also corroborating photographs of the defendants holding their murder weapons to flaunt their military prowess, labeled "Two officers competing in the killing of one hundred people." Furthermore, the confirmed verdict of Tani Hisao, the already convicted defendant in the Nanjing Massacre case, states that the Japanese army scattered inside and outside the city, launching a large-scale massacre, including a killing competition, which refers to the crimes of the defendants Mukai Toshiaki and Noda Iwao. At that time, more than 190,000 of our captured soldiers and civilians were collectively killed and their bodies burned to eliminate evidence, and more than 150,000 people were killed sporadically, with their remains buried by charity groups. These are all facts confirmed by the confirmed verdict based on conclusive evidence, and this court unearthed thousands of skulls at the burial sites as evidence. Considering all of the above in conjunction, the defendants Mukai Toshiaki and Noda Iwao are accomplices in the Nanjing Massacre and there is absolutely no doubt about it. However, the defendants, knowing that there was nothing to deny, claimed that the "Tokyo Nichi Nichi Shimbun" was falsely reporting, specifically to praise the defendants' military prowess in order to win the favor of Japanese women, hoping to find good spouses soon. However, during the war, the Japanese authorities paid great attention to the control and inspection of military news, and the "Tokyo Nichi Nichi Shimbun" was an important Japanese publication. If the defendants had not engaged in this killing competition, there would have been no reason to fabricate a story and dedicate a large amount of space to promote the defendants. Moreover, the publication of the news has been confirmed by this court using the above-mentioned conclusive evidence and cannot be compared to ordinary misreporting. It can be used as the basis for the judgment, and the claim that using the brutal and animalistic act of killing as a competition could be used as a marriage advertisement to win the favor of women is unprecedented in modern human history. All of their defenses are untenable. Next, Tanaka Gunkichi, the defendant, was a direct subordinate of Tani Hisao, the already convicted defendant. He admitted that he carried his "Joseon sword" and participated in the massacre when Tani Hisao captured Nanjing. The enemy leader Tani Hisao and others often led their troops in a massacre in our capital that was appalling and lasted for more than ten days, killing more than 300,000 people. There is not only the confirmed verdict of this court's 36th year Criminal Trial No. 1, but it is also a fact known to the world. Since the defendant Tanaka Gunkichi was in the position of a direct subordinate of Tani Hisao, carried a knife and participated, and more than 300 of our captured soldiers and civilians died under the defendant's "Joseon sword in the chaotic slaughter, there is evidence in the book "Imperial Soldiers" compiled by Japanese military officer Yamanaka Gakutaro, which published a photo of the defendant's military knife, labeled "Captain (referring to Tanaka Gunkichi) who has cut down 300 people, beloved sword Joseon," and there is also a photo of the defendant personally wielding his knife to kill civilians, which can be used as evidence. There is no doubt that he is one of the accomplices who carried out the killings in the Nanjing Massacre. Although he argued that the person photographed was wearing a shirt, indicating it was summer, while the capture of Nanjing was in winter, indicating that the photo could only prove that he had chopped down one person in another place, regardless of whether, to facilitate movement, it is common to remove outer clothing, even in winter, during vigorous chopping. It is not allowed to cling to this in an attempt to evade responsibility, and his participation in the Nanjing Massacre has been corroborated by numerous pieces of evidence, as mentioned above, and there is no room for further cunning explanations. According to the defendants' continuous massacre of prisoners of war and non-combatants, which violates the Hague Land Warfare Regulations and the Geneva Convention on the Treatment of Prisoners of War, it should constitute war crimes and crimes against humanity. Their view of slaughtering civilians as military prowess and using killing as a competition for entertainment is extremely brutal, cruel, and unparalleled. They are truly pests of mankind and enemies of civilization. If they are not severely punished according to the law, how can we maintain discipline and uphold morality? Therefore, they are each sentenced to the most severe penalty to serve as a warning.

Based on the above conclusions, in accordance with the Hague Land Warfare Regulations Article 4 Paragraph 2, Article 23 Paragraph 3, Article 46 Paragraph 1, Geneva Convention on the Treatment of Prisoners of War Article 2, Article 3, War Crimes Trial Ordinance Article 1, Article 2 Paragraph 2, Article 3 Paragraph 1, Article 11, Criminal Law Article 28, Article 56 Forepart, Article 57, the judgment is as stated in the main text.

### French Interior Minister Moch Issues Warning, Crisis in Europe Still Lurks, Beware of the International Communist Spring Offensive

[Reuters London 21st Dispatch] British Labour Party leaders predict that before the spring, the Communist Party will launch a strike offensive in Western Europe, and Britain will also be affected by the unrest at that time. Reports from Europe show that the Communist Party's plans to disrupt the French economy have not been completely defeated, and the serious struggle in Italy has not even begun. The general impression is that the Communist Party's strength in Italian trade unions is stronger than in France, but so far, it has not been fully deployed. Communist leaders have stated that the recent general strike in France has had a lasting effect on the French economy, and even with temporary assistance from the United States, workers will be able to raise the issue of wages again in three months.

[Associated Press Paris 21st Dispatch] French new Interior Minister Moch met alone with Associated Press reporters today, on the bloody labour unrest and riots that occurred in France and Italy last month he said, "This is obviously an international" attack against the Marshall Plan. European Communist parties are following the orders of the Communist Information Bureau, launching illegal acts to disrupt the economies and normal lives of their respective countries, so that when the Marshall Plan is implemented, the plan will be completely ineffective. Moch firmly believes that the recent difficulties in France are not a rehearsal for a civil war, but a general rehearsal for the next civil war. Through this conflict, the Communist Party can train its troops, such as the commando teams in the north and Marseille. The Communist Party was given strict orders to only use stones and iron bars, and not to use weapons, so this was not a military action. Moch continued, the French government has learned of the plans that the French Communist Party, the Communist Information Bureau, and the Italian Communist Party are about to implement in unison. The French Communist Party believes that the democratic French government will not be able to take strong and swift action to deal with this move, and the French Communist Party expects that the French government will either collapse or agree to the demands of the strikers." Moch also said that the French Communist Party's failure had three reasons: First, the French government took swift and powerful actions throughout the country and in parliament, and parliament had to pass special bills to deter sabotage. Second, the working class is very sophisticated and no longer blindly follows the Communist Party's lead. Third, the Minister of Labour never closed the door to negotiations with the General Confederation of Labour. Moch believes that the French Communist Party will definitely make a comeback, and more riots may break out in February and March of next year when vegetable and meat prices are particularly high.

### France Willing to Negotiate with Occupying Powers at Any Time to Seek a Solution to the German Problem, French Parliament Debates New Financial Plan

[United Press Paris 21st Dispatch] Foreign Minister Bidault declared at a closed meeting of the National Assembly's Foreign Affairs Committee today that France is willing to negotiate with other occupying powers on the future of Germany at any time, and a beneficial solution can be obtained, but our actions are completely free, and our general position and goals will remain unchanged.

[Reuters Paris 21st Dispatch] The National Assembly began debating today the plan proposed by Finance Minister Mayer to increase revenue and reduce expenditure. Communist Party members issued serious attacks. Communist Party member Leger denounced it as a system that exploits the working class and sternly rebuked Mayer, "You are more willing to win the trust of American banking tycoons than the trust of the French people." Another Communist Party member, Clua said that this plan will definitely not work, because repressive measures will never win broad support.

### Soviet Fleet Strength Enhanced

[Central News Agency Washington 20th Dispatch] A publication of the U.S. Navy Department said that the Soviet fleet is growing rapidly, but pointed out that many of the ships held by the Soviet Union are quite old. The Navy Department's official magazine said that the Soviet fleet has become stronger than before as a result of this war. It is said that the information obtained shows that the Soviet Union has four major fleets: the Baltic Sea, the Black Sea, and the Pacific Ocean, as well as small fleets in the Caspian Sea and internal rivers. It also said that the Soviet Union has begun planning to build warships in recent years and has obtained ships from Allied countries and defeated enemy countries. The Soviet Union already has a submarine fleet, including high-speed submarines obtained from Germany under an agreement with the United Kingdom and the United States at the end of the war. It is said that the Soviet Union is building ships and giant destroyers in Vladivostok in the Far East.

### Division of Warships to the Soviet Union and France

[Reuters Rome 20th Dispatch] The Four-Power Naval Committee has submitted to the Italian government a list of warships that Italy must hand over to the Soviet Union and France in accordance with the peace treaty. According to the definition of the peace treaty, Italy should hand over 30 warships to the four powers, including the 35,000-ton battleships Italy and Vittorio Veneto, and the 13,000-ton battleship Caesar. The United Kingdom and the United States have announced that they will abandon their share, but these abandoned portions should be dismantled and not used as part of the Italian Navy.

### American and Italian Leaders Exchange Telegrams

[Reuters, Washington, 20th] On the day the last contingent of American troops stationed in Italy withdrew from the country on the 15th of this month, Italian Prime Minister De Gasperi telegraphed President Truman, saying, "On this day when all Allied forces are withdrawing from Italian territory, I would like to express to Your Excellency that the Italian people will never forget the Allied forces' action in liberating Italy and the spirit of fighting alongside the Allied forces."

President Truman replied, "I am deeply aware that the Italian government and people are determined to safeguard the freedom they have obtained. The people of our country are wholeheartedly pleased to learn that Italy is jointly defending freedom and democracy with other peace-loving nations in the world."

### The Open and Covert Struggles Between Eastern and Western Powers; Future Trends Worth Watching; Rumor of Stalin Reprimanding the Soviet Foreign Minister

[United Press, London, 21st] The diplomatic correspondent of the London "People's Daily" reported that after Molotov returned to the country, Stalin convened a special meeting of the Politburo to severely reprimand Molotov for failing to prevent the breakdown of the Four-Power London Conference. Stalin also firmly demanded a thorough investigation into the causes of the failure. Other senior Soviet officials also heavily criticized Molotov's actions during the meeting. The newspaper's correspondent speculated that, due to this development, the Soviet Union might adopt a slightly more conciliatory approach in diplomacy at its next meeting with Western countries.

[Reuters, London, 21st] The crossroads of the major powers' relationships has reached its most obvious point since the end of the war, but future developments are still in a stage of speculation. Since the failure of the London Foreign Ministers' Conference, neither the United States nor the Soviet Union has revealed its intention for its next action. The question today is whether to continue trying to maintain the framework of Allied cooperation or to declare the failure of cooperation to the world. Future developments will depend on the outcome of the open struggle between the two opposing systems. Only the decision-makers in Moscow and Washington know whether they are prepared to abandon the common goals of the Allies. Outsiders have no way of obtaining any indication until one of the four powers takes a diplomatic initiative. The talks given by Bevin and Bidault in London show that London or Paris will not take such an initiative before the New Year. Representatives of the Foreign Ministers discussing the Austrian issue are scheduled to meet before February 1 to listen to the latest Soviet proposals. If the four powers still have a month to deliberate, we can start from the existing international agreements and find the following possibilities: None of the major powers will take formal steps to end or replace the Foreign Ministers' Conference mechanism, but this will not prevent Western countries or the Soviet Union from developing the current system in their occupied areas. The discussion of the three Western powers on coordinating the policies of the three western zones of Germany will be held without the future mission of the Foreign Ministers' Conference being determined. The way in which the three powers discuss and the selection of participants are of great significance, as the Soviet Union's opposition will inevitably be based on this method and level. One of the four powers will take the initiative to demand the end of the Foreign Ministers' Conference. Since the agreement reached by the major powers on the basis of a peace treaty has faced bankruptcy, one or more powers may decide to submit this entire matter to a higher authority, such as the United Nations organization. One of the three powers, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, invokes the Yalta Agreement to convene a three-power conference, so that the relations between the powers can be brought back on track outside the Foreign Ministers' Conference. From the perspective of the above points, the first two items are at least the most likely in the near future.

### British Celebrities Issue an Appeal: The Three Giants Should Hold Consultations to Establish Atomic Energy Control to Avoid Catastrophe

[Central News Agency, London, 20th] Ten prominent figures in Britain today issued a joint statement, urging Prime Minister Attlee and President Truman to find a way to make Stalin face up to the international tensions caused by the breakdown of the Four Foreign Ministers' London Conference. The signatories to the declaration include Liberal Party Member of Parliament Reid, famous philosopher Lord Russell, famous educator and poet Eliot, St. Paul's Cathedral pastor Matthews, former Foreign Office adviser Lord Vansittart, and four Labour Party Members of Parliament. The declaration expressed great concern about the continued growth of communist forces in many countries, and believed that it was regrettable that after the Allied countries overthrew one form of totalitarianism after six years of great war, they only replaced it with another form of totalitarianism that was even more powerful than fascism. The declaration, while emphasizing the threat of atomic war, attributed the failure of all attempts to control atomic energy to "the Soviet Union's stubborn attitude." The declaration suggested that Attlee and Truman should make it clear to Stalin that atomic war must be avoided. The declaration further stated that if such powerful mediation fails, "all freedom-loving countries should closely liaise with Britain and the United States and act in unison to develop a transcendent defense force, including atomic power, so that no strong country dares to provoke them."

### New Italian Constitution to be Implemented on New Year's Day

[Reuters, Rome, 1st] The new constitution here will be implemented from January 1st, and the final approval has been given. The election of the first Congress of the American Republic is expected to be held in April next year. The constitution stipulates that the parliament will have a Senate and a House of Representatives. The Senate will have 208 members with a term of six years, and the House of Representatives will have 600 members with a term of five years. The constitution declares Italy to be a democratic republic, guarantees the right of workers to strike and the payment of holiday wages, and the Lateran Treaty signed with the Holy See is also incorporated into the new constitution. At the same time, it prohibits the implementation of restrictions on any religion. The new constitution also stipulates that the people have the right to referendum on laws. Some regions should implement local autonomy, abandon war as an instrument of aggression, and prohibit the revival of the Fascist Party.

### Soviet Union Consolidates Position in German Occupation Zone: Opposition Party Leaders Removed

[United Press, Berlin, 20th] Soviet military authorities took swift action tonight to consolidate their position in the German occupation zone to prevent any incidents that may occur after the failure of the London Four Foreign Ministers' Conference. Two leaders of the Christian Democratic Party in the Soviet occupation zone have been dismissed. The party is nominally the opposition party in the Soviet occupation zone. The editor of the Berlin newspaper "New Daily" has also been replaced.

### Economic Conference of Sixteen European Nations Planned to Reopen Early Next Year; Rumor That Harriman Will Be Appointed President of the Aid Europe Program

[Reuters, Washington, 21st] Observers here believe that the economic conference of the sixteen European countries will reopen early next year to consider Europe's action plan based on President Truman's Aid Europe program submitted to Congress. Observers believe that this move by the sixteen European countries will be the most concrete response from Western democracies to the breakdown of the London Foreign Ministers' Conference.

Members of the U.S. Congress also feel that what interests Congress most is the report from Europe that European countries have already begun to act to abolish trade barriers and establish agreements on industrial production.

[Reuters, Washington, 21st] It is rumored here that former Wisconsin Senator Harriman is expected to be appointed as the president of the Marshall Aid Europe Program. When Harriman met with reporters from this agency, he declined to discuss the possibility of taking up this position, but emphasized that he was a key behind-the-scenes figure in drafting the Aid Europe plan and fully agreed with the program and management method recommended by Truman to Congress. Harriman, 51, is a member of the Harriman Committee and has close ties with the Republican Party, so he is expected to receive support from Congress.

### Stalin's Birthday and Election as a Member of the Moscow City Council

According to the results of five state counts, the voting in the 58th electoral district, the Moscow district, took only five hours, and by 11 a.m., 100% of voters unanimously elected Stalin.

[Reuters, Moscow, 21st] Today is Marshal Stalin's 68th birthday, and it is also the day of city elections across the Soviet Union. Stalin is also one of the candidates for the city elections. Moscow is decorated with flags and banners, and bands are playing in the city's squares at the same time. Tonight, the Moscow Opera House will perform a special oratorio, and Stalin himself, diplomats from various countries, and key Soviet figures will attend.

### The U Saw Case Will Be Concluded; Defense Lawyers Vigorously Plead Not Guilty

### Lack of Food and Fuel: Europe Spends Christmas; The Pope Issues a Christmas Edict Calling for Peace

[United Press, Vatican City, 21st] Pope Pius XII's Christmas Eve speech is scheduled to be broadcast to the world by Vatican Radio in Italian at 9:55 p.m. standard time, and then translated into English, German, French, Polish, Spanish, Hungarian, Dutch, and Portuguese for separate broadcasts.

[United Press, Vatican City, 20th] Pope Pius XII issued a Christmas edict today entitled "The Most Desired Peace," calling on Catholics to pray for peace throughout the world. The edict used poignant words to condemn those who incite humans to rebel against each other, and stated that class hatred has the potential to destroy and subvert the fundamental foundations of various countries. This statement clearly refers to the Communist Party and Italy.

[United Press, London, 20th] The people of thirteen European countries will spend a more abundant Christmas holiday than in 1939. The people of nine other countries will spend the most minimalist holiday in eight years, but the joy of Christmas is the same in all countries. A brief description of the situation is as follows: "United Kingdom:" British people can buy sixpence more of fresh meat, which is equal to half a crown's worth of ration. The sugar ration during the holidays is almost doubled, and the candy ration is doubled. There are more gifts in the shops, and the prices are higher. Rationing is mainly implemented, and the fuel supply is also more adequate. "France:" The shops on both sides of the Champs-Élysées in Paris are stocked with extravagant gifts. Prices have risen by about 50%. Food supplies are scarce. The daily bread ration has been reduced to 20 centimeters, about three small slices. Fuel is lacking. France needs to build one million more houses, but construction materials are lacking. "Germany:" The Christmas dinner for most Berliners will be sweet potato soup and the leftover fresh meat or herring from the ration of less than one pound every ten days. People aged six to twenty will get an additional pound of sugar. Every German child in the American-occupied zone will receive Christmas candy, pastries, and special food rations. "Italy:" The United States is providing aid to Italy with materials and fuel. There are sufficient consumer goods in the shops, but fuel is scarce and expensive. "Austria:" Food panic is serious, housing is scarce, and the fuel supply is serious. "Belgium:" Shops are full of food. The coal ration is 500 pounds, which is more than enough. "Denmark:" Food is abundant. Christmas candy is relatively scarce. "Yugoslavia:" Food is more abundant. Housing is a serious problem, and there is no shortage of fuel. Christmas dinner includes roasted pork and candy. "Czech Republic:" The shop windows in the capital are full of toys, the food shops are full of goods, there are many Christmas gifts, but fuel is lacking. "Sweden:" Although the main items are rationed, there is a lot of black market food. "Netherlands:" The meat ration has been doubled to 400 grams per week.

### The Reason for Non-Prosecution of Li Zhuomin and Eight Others Accused of Corruption: Even if There are Inappropriate Aspects, They Fall Under Administrative Issues; Investigation Results Indicate Insufficient Evidence of Criminal Suspicion

[Our Newspaper's Report] Following the investigation by the District Procuratorate into the corruption case involving Li Zhuomin, Deputy Director-General of the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CRRRA), and others, Hou Aichang, Cheng Daoyi, Hu Keshi, and twelve other defendants have been prosecuted. Li Zhuomin, Lu Hanqin, Xu Shichang, Chen Guangyuan, Wang Fusheng, and nine others have not been prosecuted. The reasons for the prosecution have been published in this newspaper. The reasons for the non-prosecution of Li and others are also of interest to the public. The following is an excerpt from the original text of the non-prosecution disposition:

Defendant Li Zhuomin, Deputy Director-General of the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CRRRA); Lu Hanqin, Chief Secretary; Xu Shichang, former Director of the General Affairs Department; Chen Guangyuan, Director of the Storage and Transportation Department; Wang Fusheng, Director of the Distribution Department; Huang Weiqing, Section Chief of the Third Section of the Distribution Department; Zhang Zihui, concurrently Section Chief and Specialized Commissioner; Li Huan, Specialist of the Distribution Department; Peng Wuhuang, Section Chief of the Materials Procurement and Sales Office. Regarding the aforementioned defendants' case involving suspicion of corruption, the investigation has concluded that they should not be prosecuted. The reasons are stated as follows:

Regarding Li Zhuomin's Part

Upon investigation, of the four points of suspicion of corruption against the defendant, the first point concerns the purchase, sale, transportation, and distribution of relief materials by the CRRRA. These operations were handled separately by the various responsible units within the administration and supervised by the Executive Director. The defendant's position as Deputy Director-General was merely to assist the Director-General in handling administrative affairs within the administration. This is evidenced by the CRRRA's Thirty-Fifth Year Pu Mi Zi No. 450 telegram and the CRRRA's organizational adjustment regulations. Since the defendant was not fully in charge of supervising the aforementioned operations, even if the responsible personnel had illegal conduct, the defendant could not have known everything. Therefore, the defendant's argument that he is not responsible for joint and conniving responsibility is not without merit. The second point of accusation, regarding the concealment of enemy property, the electric refrigerator, is also supported by the photograph on the fifth page of the safekeeping certificate issued by the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration to the Real Estate Department of the Central Trust Bureau on January 16, Thirty-Fifth Year. Upon verification, the photograph does indeed contain a record of an electric refrigerator. Therefore, the defendant's argument that there was no possibility of concealing enemy property is credible. Although the defendant did not instruct the safekeeping personnel to affix the receiving agency's label to the borrowed enemy and puppet furniture, intending to improve the appearance, this is a different matter and is not sufficient to deem him guilty of embezzlement.

The third point of accusation, regarding instructing Li Rongxian of the CRRRA's Personnel Office to reimburse travel expenses, which is suspected of disrupting the system and engaging in fraud, is investigated as follows: The defendant traveled to various parts of the country for inspection five times in May and June of the Thirty-Sixth Year. The travel expenses for each trip amounted to several tens of thousands of yuan, which is not a very large sum. It has been investigated and verified by personnel dispatched by the Jiangsu Supervisory Commissioner's Office, as evidenced by the original impeachment document and attached copies. The fact that Li Rongxian handled the reimbursement of travel expenses for each trip was because Li Rongxian served as the secretary of the inspection team when he participated in the inspection tour, which had nothing to do with his original position in the CRRRA. The defendant submitted five lists of inspection team members of the work team's inspection branch, a report on the work team's affairs handled by Li Rongxian, and related documents, which were verified to be correct. The defendant's argument that he did not interfere with general affairs and disrupt the system to engage in fraud is credible. As for the fourth point of accusation, regarding Liu Qingyu's illegal promotion, Liu Qingyu originally served as a specialist in the CRRRA, receiving a monthly salary of 300 yuan. Because of his diligent work, he was promoted to secretary during the year-end performance evaluation in the Thirty-Fifth Year, receiving a monthly salary of 400 yuan. This was approved by Huo Shishi, Director-General of the CRRRA, as evidenced by the photograph of the CRRRA's year-end performance evaluation certificate for Liu Qingyu in the Thirty-Fifth Year. Even if Liu Qingyu's promotion was inappropriate, it is an administrative issue, and it is difficult to hold the defendant criminally liable. In summary, the defendant's criminal suspicion is clearly insufficient. Regarding

Lu Hanqin's Part: The defendant is the Chief Secretary of the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CRRRA). Because he was new to Shanghai, and the administration did not have staff dormitories to provide accommodation, the Director-General specially approved him to temporarily stay in a hotel after his family arrived in Shanghai. From February 5 to September 5 of the Thirty-Sixth Year, he used Room 901 of the International Hotel, incurring a total of 85,264,320 yuan in legal tender. The defendant also signed through the General Affairs Department to request the Director-General's approval for renting a house, and successively allocated house repair fees and relocation fees for the previous tenant, totaling 70 million yuan in legal tender. These were all approved by the General Affairs Department and paid by the Finance Department, and were not handled by the defendant. All of these facts have been verified by reviewing the relevant files and receipts of the administration. The defendant's expenses were approved by the Director-General and paid by the Finance Department according to law. Even if the expenses were excessive, it is a different matter. The suspicion that the defendant sought to benefit himself is insufficient. Regarding

Xu Shichang's Part: The initial accusation against the defendant, who is a specialized commissioner and the director of the General Affairs Department of the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, is that he engaged in fraud by cutting white printing paper. Upon questioning, the defendant stated: "The white printing paper was surplus material from the U.S. military, and the sizes had already been cut. There were no large-sized papers (i.e., large papers), only self-typing paper, which had to be cut into smaller sizes. We received 355 reams of white typing paper, issued 170 reams, paid to cut 85 reams, and still had 100 reams. The part that was paid to cut was cut into 100,000 sheets, each 8 inches wide and 10.5 inches long (i.e., one sheet cut into four sheets), and 50,000 sheets, each 8 inches wide and 13 inches long (i.e., one sheet cut into three sheets). Because the sizes cut were different, the resulting square inches were naturally different and could not be compared with each other. Moreover, the paper scraps left over from cutting were very small and could not be used. According to custom, these paper scraps were given to the paper-cutting workers." The number of white typing papers received and paid was verified by reviewing the relevant account books and found to be correct. (Omission) The defendant's argument that he did not engage in any fraud in cutting white typing paper is credible. Regarding

Chen Guangyuan's Part: The defendant is the Director of the Storage and Transportation Department of the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CRRRA) and the Director of the Shanghai Storage and Transportation Bureau. (Omission) The contract for managing ships, which was signed between the Shanghai Storage and Transportation Bureau and the United Transportation Company on June 8 of the Thirty-Fifth Year, was signed before the defendant took office as the director of the bureau in September of the Thirty-Fifth Year. After the defendant took office, he discovered that the United Transportation Company was poorly managed, and changed the contract to the Jiutong Company. The relevant files of the bureau have been retrieved and verified. The Jiutong Company was established on May 14 of the Thirtieth Year and is located at Room 66, 4th Floor, 119 Yu Chi Road. The Fuxing Transportation Company was established at the end of September of the Thirty-Fourth Year and is located at Room 210, 2nd Floor, 3 East Zhongshan Road. The persons in charge of the respective companies and firms, Bai Xuchu, Kang Jingfu, and Huang Quangui, have testified to this, and their registration certificates and business licenses have been retrieved and verified. The defendant's argument that they are not fictitious names and monopolizing business is not without merit. As for the abandonment of rotten goods by the bureau, a total of 3,480 tons before September of the Thirty-Sixth Year (i.e., before the occurrence of this case), and about 300 tons after October of this year, were all appraised by experts from the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, and representatives signed the documents, and personnel were dispatched to escort them to Wusong and throw them into the Huangpu River. The files of the submerged materials of the bureau have been retrieved and verified to be true. The defendant's argument that he did not take the opportunity to embezzle materials is also credible. Regarding

Wang Fusheng, Huang Weiqing, Zhang Zihui, and Li Huan's Part: Defendant Wang Fusheng is the Director of the Distribution Department of the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CRRRA). Defendants Huang Weiqing and Zhang Zihui are both section chiefs of the department. Defendant Li Huan is a specialist of the department. The distribution of materials was carried out in accordance with the decisions of the Joint Distribution Committee of the CRRRA and UNRRA and its affiliated subcommittees. They could not freely dispose of the materials. The meeting minutes of the respective committees have been submitted and can be verified. The quantity of inventory materials and the actual number of goods picked up by the allocated parties were handled by special personnel in the Shanghai Storage and Transportation Bureau and the warehouse. Even if the number of materials was inconsistent, or the personnel managing the materials were suspected of colluding and engaging in fraud, it has nothing to do with the distribution. Although defendants Wang Fusheng and others did not wait for the actual number of materials to be verified, but immediately carried out the distribution based on the assumed number notified by the Joint Committee in writing, which caused duplication problems, it was inappropriate. However, this is an administrative problem, and it is difficult to hold them criminally liable. As for defendant Li Huan, when he was being investigated regarding the situation of the sale and distribution of electric fans, he claimed that the distribution of electric fans was handled by various units, and all meeting minutes and distribution lists were kept separately by the personnel in charge, and he did not immediately try to collect them for verification, which is prone to misunderstanding, and is also inappropriate. However, since it was subsequently submitted to the Jiangsu Supervisory Commissioner's Office for verification and then returned, and was submitted for investigation during the court's investigation, it is difficult to conclude that defendants Wang Fusheng and others concealed official documents and assisted in embezzlement.

Regarding Peng Wuhuang's Part: The defendant is the Section Chief of the Materials Procurement and Sales Office of the Finance Department of the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CRRRA), and is accused of assisting in the sale of materials to seek profits. (Omission) Regarding the bidding, door sales, or suspension of sales, and the sales prices of electric fans by the Materials Procurement and Sales Office of the Finance Department of the CRRRA, the general manager of the office, Hou Aichang, was responsible for making the decisions. Hou Aichang has stated this in the investigation by the Jiangsu Supervisory Commissioner's Office and the court's investigation. Regarding the fact that the Sanbei Company applied to the office in May of the Thirty-Sixth Year to purchase 400 electric fans, but because they were not practical, they sent a letter stating that they would only buy 160 fans, and the remaining 240 fans were requested to be returned, all of which were voluntary. The remaining 240 fans were purchased by Zhuang Zhenwen, the second bidder in the office's May bidding, who paid 356,000 yuan per fan according to the May bidding price. The defendant did not obstruct or solicit rewards. This has been testified to by Sun Beiping and Han Enyan, the persons in charge of the Sanbei Company. As for the Zhengyi Trading Company extracting 500 electric fans purchased through bidding, totaling 42 boxes, because there were two extra fans, the office staff directly negotiated with Miao Yuming, the person handling the matter for the company, to purchase them. Miao Yuming has also testified to this clearly in the case. However, upon investigation, only 500 fans were bid out in this bidding. The defendant sold two extra fans and allowed the office staff to purchase them, which is inconsistent with the CRRRA's regulations prohibiting staff from purchasing materials, and is therefore inappropriate. However, this is an administrative problem. Since the defendant has not been found to have evidence of profiteering, the suspicion of his crime is insufficient.

In summary, in accordance with Article 1, Paragraph 1 of the Special Criminal Cases Litigation Regulations, and Article 231, Item 10 of the Criminal Procedure Law, the disposition of non-prosecution is made.

### Sympathizing with the Clothing Donation Movement: Mostly Lower- and Middle-Class Families; Tongji Students Running Tirelessly; Their Spirit of Perseverance is Admirable

[Our Newspaper's Report] In order to expand the work of donating winter clothing to relieve refugees, Tongji University students formally established the "Tongji University Donation Drive Committee" the day before yesterday. Yesterday was Sunday, and more than 300 students started working at 8 a.m., forming small groups of five people each and heading to the residents in the Hongkou District to solicit donations of winter clothing. From morning to night, they collected a great deal, totaling more than 60 quilts, more than 2,000 pieces of winter clothing, including old suits and jackets, and more than 50 pairs of shoes and 200-300 pieces of socks, scarves, etc. The donation team was originally limited to soliciting winter clothing, but many residents, because they had no old clothes to donate, contributed cash instead, raising more than 6 million yuan in one day. The committee plans to use this money to buy old clothes from used clothing stores, and transport them together with the donated winter clothing to distribute to refugees in the Hongkou and Zhabei areas at 1 p.m. this afternoon. At the same time, the donation work will continue to be carried out. According to the students who went out to solicit donations: most of those who donate old clothes or cash are from lower- and middle-class families. On the other hand, most upper-class families misunderstand, or even treat them with disdain, making the work very difficult. The committee sincerely hopes that this work can gain the widespread sympathy of the society, and that people will donate generously to benefit the suffering refugees, which would be of great significance.

[Our Newspaper's Report] At the Jin Lan brothel located at No. 36, Lane 961, North Sichuan Road, more than 20 men wearing uniforms suddenly arrived the night before last.

After someone reported the incident, the nearby military police sent troops to the scene to suppress the situation, and arrested seven perpetrators and took them to the team for interrogation. The injured brothel owner and others were sent to the hospital.

### A Love Letter Causes Trouble: Female Worker Commits Suicide by Poisoning

### Christmas is Approaching, But Stores are Quiet: Turkeys Priced at a Million; Lamentations are Heard Everywhere

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Christmas season is approaching, and Christmas gifts are displayed in the city. Due to import restrictions, turkeys are mostly supplied by the area near Dinghai, Zhejiang Province, resulting in unusually high prices, with a selling price of 120,000 yuan per pound, requiring more than a million yuan for one. Christmas trees cost from 200,000 to 1 million yuan each. Silver bells, candles, and Christmas flower baskets also require several million yuan to complete the decoration of wealthy merchants. Therefore, apart from larger stores, the windows are generally very quiet. Occasionally, some stores use Santa Claus as window display advertisements, and the bags are filled with the store's merchandise. This only makes children who linger on the street expecting Christmas gifts sigh. Apart from the usual prayer ceremonies held on Christmas morning, due to the high prices, it seems that the grand gestures of gathering large crowds to distribute candy and clothes, etc., as in previous years, will no longer be possible. The trading of Christmas gifts on West Nanjing Road and Central Linsen Road is also very sparse. Only Sullivan's is making giant Christmas cakes, styled in a Western-style two-story garden building, although it is more magnificent than usual, no one has inquired about it as of today.

Gift Prices Have Increased 15 Times

According to Yong'an Company's statistics, the company's retail sales of Christmas gifts in the week before Christmas averaged 1,200 invoices per day before the war, while now there are only about 350. The price of gifts has increased 15 times compared to before the war, which is the main reason for the sluggish trading. This year, due to the development of import and export trade, many foreigners have brought their families to establish homes in Shanghai. Recently, the American soldiers stationed in Shanghai have also welcomed their families here. Therefore, 60-70% of the buyers of Christmas gifts are them. What is particularly different about this year's Christmas toys compared to previous years is that the source of foreign goods has been cut off, and all toys are made by domestic manufacturers. The jeep toys that were popular last year have become a thing of the past, replaced by large three-wheeled army toys. Foreigners especially like to buy them in competition and send them by airmail to relatives and friends in their home countries as the only commemorative Christmas gift for living in China. The application from each dance hall to extend business hours on Christmas Eve has not yet been approved by the Bureau, so the mood is not enthusiastic. However, colorful paper hats, masks, and floral decorations are being made in a hurry. The tea fee has also been set at one times the normal price, about 140,000 to 180,000 yuan per cup. At that time, the carnival scene may still be unavoidable.

Private Dance Parties Will See an Increase

This year, because the banquets in each building are subject to conservation restrictions, many private individuals plan to invite relatives and friends to hold large-scale gatherings and dance parties at home on Christmas Eve, and enjoy themselves all night long. Therefore, it is expected that this year's private dance parties will be more grand than last year. In addition, the Xinjiang Song and Dance Troupe will spend the holiday in Shanghai this time. They are very interested in this day with religious significance. In order to show their celebration of the festival with the citizens of Shanghai and the foreigners stationed in Shanghai, they will choose a square to perform border songs and dances as much as possible. However, recently, the cold wave has filled the air, and in the streets of minus five degrees, refugees are crying for hunger and cold, and the number of exposed corpses has increased. The snow scene decorated with cotton wool and silver flowers in the store windows is set off against the scene, which is really heartbreaking.

### A Beautiful Tale of Sino-American Romance: Flying Tiger General Marries Female Journalist; Lovers Become Husband and Wife; Chennault and Anna Chennault Hold Wedding in Shanghai

[Reported by this newspaper] Former commander of the U.S. Fourteenth Air Force, Flying Tiger General Chennault (see picture), held a wedding ceremony yesterday afternoon at his private residence on Hongqiao Road in this city with Miss Anna Chennault (see picture), a reporter for the Central News Agency, officiated by Pastor Moton Shen. Few outsiders knew about this, and even close friends of both parties had not heard of it beforehand. It is learned that there were twelve guests attending the wedding of General Chen and Miss Chen yesterday. The bride was escorted into the hall by her father. The bride's stepmother and Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, Dr. Y.C. James Yen, were also present. The groom's best man was Colonel Frank Schiel, former pilot of the Flying Tigers, and the bride's maid of honor was her sister, Miss Cynthia Chen. It is said that the newlyweds will remain in Shanghai after the wedding.

General Chennault is currently 57 years old and is the world's most famous expert in bomber aviation. During the outbreak of the War of Resistance against Japan in China, Chen was hired to come to China as an air force advisor to Chairman Chiang. He then organized the Flying Tigers with American volunteer aviators, fought in various southwestern provinces of China, and repeatedly performed meritorious deeds, being hailed as a "Friend of China." After the outbreak of the Pacific War, when the United States officially declared war on Japan, he reorganized the Flying Tigers into the Fourteenth Air Force, under Chen's command. He recently received a U.S. Navy Medal. General Chen is currently the director of the Executive Yuan's Air Transport Brigade. Miss Chen is from Guangdong Province and is currently 24 years old. During the War of Resistance, she joined the Central News Agency as a reporter in Kunming. Her acquaintance with General Chen began when she was a reporter in Yunnan. After the war, Miss Chen was transferred to Shanghai. Her interviewing skills have long been praised by all sectors of society. The lady's father was formerly the Chinese Consul in San Francisco. He recently returned to China from the United States and has been transferred to the post of Consul in Sarawak, Borneo, and will soon go to take up his new position. According to reports, there had been rumors about the mutual affection between General Chen and Miss Chen, although the lady repeatedly denied it, most friends expected their happy event to be near. Now the Sino-American marriage has truly come to fruition; it is indeed a beautiful tale.

### Night Navigation Lighting Equipment Newly Arrived from the United States, To Be Lit Up Starting Christmas Day

[Reported by this newspaper] The night navigation lighting equipment purchased by the Civil Aviation Administration from the United States has already arrived at Longhua Airport and is being installed on both sides of the newly built concrete runway immediately. It can be lit up on the 25th of this month. The lights are extremely bright, with each lamp emitting 380 watts. One lamp is installed every 300 feet along both sides of the runway, illuminating the airport brightly when all are lit. Because this equipment is too powerful and easily damaged if used frequently, it will not be used lightly under normal circumstances, but will be turned on when there is heavy fog or low visibility. From now on, aviation safety in this city will have another major guarantee.

### Civil Aviation Administration Allocates Funds to Build Airport Terminal Building

[Reported by this newspaper] Airports in advanced countries around the world all have airport terminal buildings. The so-called airport terminal building includes departments that handle matters related to aircraft entry and exit, such as the Civil Aviation Administration, Customs, and airlines, and is a systematic and organized arrangement. Before boarding and after disembarking, passengers must go through various departments in a clear order to complete various procedures before they can board or leave. In terms of maintaining order and saving time, airport terminal buildings are indispensable structures. Our Civil Aviation Administration considers Longhua Airport in this city to be an international airport, with frequent aircraft traffic and a focus of attention for both Chinese and foreign observers, so it allocated huge funds to build an airport terminal building. It is learned that the building has already started construction.

### Cracking Down on Gasoline Hoarding; Enforcement Steps Being Planned; Investigations Will Be Conducted on Oil Companies and Gas Stations

[Reported by this newspaper] Gasoline in this city will soon be subject to unified control. The Gasoline Allocation Committee, at its first meeting last week, in addition to determining personnel, also drafted enforcement steps on how to crack down on gasoline hoarding and black market sales.

### Securing the Central Plains

[Reported from Nanjing on the 21st by this newspaper] The north wind is piercingly cold, and the weather is bitterly frozen. The battles in the icy and snowy north are probably unimaginable for people in Nanjing and Shanghai. However, the cold of the north will spread southward, and the news of the suffering in the north, at the end of this year when the temperature has already dropped below zero, is enough to stir the hearts of the capital. The Henan petitioners who recently flew to the capital to petition complained bitterly about many things on the morning of the 20th. Vice Speaker Zhang Honglie of the Provincial Senate and several representatives were extremely unwilling to make alarming statements, but the seriousness of the situation compelled them to petition.

Three Demands from the Bandits

After the Yellow River flowed into the sea through its old course in Shandong, the military situation in Shandong took a sharp turn for the worse. The bandit forces of Chen Yi and Liu Bocheng both crossed the river at once, wanting to take root in Hebei, but they quickly discovered that, after years of struggle and rule, the economic foundation of the rural areas of Hebei could no longer bear the burden of these hundreds of thousands of soldiers. The well-established "Join the Army Movement" could no longer supply troops from the Hebei Plain, and the lack of food and clothing made it difficult to even get through the winter. Thus, hundreds of thousands of troops, along with Chen Geng's bandit forces, swept down from the east and west, chanting to launch the "Three Demands Movement" using hollow-center tactics, demanding clothing, food, and soldiers, ultimately wanting to take root in the Funiu Mountains and the Dabie Mountains. Unexpectedly, their attempt failed due to defeats in the border areas of Henan and Hubei and in the Wanxi region. With a shift in direction, they directly approached the heart of the Central Plains.

Tight Situation in Henan Province

"Henan is tense everywhere, especially the triangular area of Kaifeng, Zhengzhou, and Xuchang. The combined forces of Chen Geng, Chen Yi, and Liu Bocheng are all targeting this area. This is the center of Henan, the hub of the Pinghan and Longhai Railways. Its gain or loss can affect the entire situation. At the same time, this is also the concentration of party, government, and military cadres in Henan. If they suffer losses, the future of Henan is unimaginable. Therefore, whether in terms of strategic geography or the preservation of talent, the value of this area is truly inestimable. The government should send reinforcements to relieve the siege, and if it can wipe out the main force of these three bandit forces in one fell swoop, the pacification of the interior will not be far off. Now, Henan is not only experiencing a tight military situation, but the existing disaster situation has also been severely affected, and food and relief funds are also urgently needed. We represent three thousand people, begging the people of the whole country to recognize the importance of the Central Plains, and earnestly requesting the government and society to provide full assistance."

The Suffering of the Central Plains

The above are all the words of Mr. Zhang. Then, everyone brought up the historical importance of the Central Plains, and everyone lamented the suffering of the Central Plains in recent years.

"South of the Yellow River, from Hangu Pass and Luoyang to Zhengzhou, Kaifeng, and Shangqiu, has been the first line of defense for southern China since ancient times. Protecting these strongholds is related to the overall situation. We are not just calling out for our hometown, we are pleading for the overall situation."

"The Central Plains has always determined the overall situation. If the Central Plains is not protected, Wuhan and Shanghai will have no guarantee. If the Longhai and Pinghan Railways are not protected, it will be difficult to defend the Tianjin-Pukou Railway. We are by no means making alarming statements, but historical facts and the situation prove this conclusion."

Not Enough Attention

During the War of Resistance, Henan contributed men and grain, protecting their homes and defending their country, doing their best. But, who dares to say that everyone has paid enough attention to the Central Plains at this moment? They believe that the situation is now urgent, but if there are three divisions of troops, the Central Plains can be secured with point-line defense, and a gradual recovery of the overall situation can be planned. Otherwise, after half a year, using this area, which is rich in grain and manpower, and employing thirty divisions of elite troops, it may be difficult to recover. They call for the rapid provision of large forces, food, relief funds, materials, and disaster relief to protect the land. (Reporter Pu Dejie)

### Boiler Explodes, Bricks and Stones Fly; Bengbu Power Plant is Too Old; Loud Noise, Fortunately No One Injured

[Reported from Bengbu on the 18th by this newspaper] The generator in the first power plant (i.e., the old plant) of the Bengbu Power Plant, due to its old age and heavy load, suddenly exploded at about 7 p.m. on the 17th. There was a loud noise, bricks and stones flew, and hot steam billowed, creating a very dangerous situation. Fortunately, most of the firemen were gathering at the corner of the room for dinner, and the person on duty quickly broke the glass on the window and jumped out, so no one was injured. After the incident, the burst opening was inspected and found to be about three feet square, severely damaged, and impossible to repair for a while. According to the person in charge of the plant, the old plant's boiler was purchased in the ninth year of the Republic of China and is old and should have been replaced long ago. The two diesel engines purchased during the War of Resistance were taken away by the Japanese invaders during the occupation. They have not been used since the victory. The city's electricity demand has increased fivefold compared to last year, and it could not bear the load, leading to this unfortunate incident. The diesel engine purchased in Shanghai will arrive soon and can be installed and generate electricity within 20 days. It has now been decided to implement staggered power outages starting on the 19th, that is, power will be cut off once every other day. It is reported that at present, electricity is supplied daily by the second power plant (Pengxin Plant).

### Eight Taiwan Sugar Industry Factories Start Operations One After Another

[Reported from Taipei on the 19th by airmail] Concerning the sugar industry, which is related to the entire economic prosperity of this province, it is estimated that eight factories in Tainan, Huwei, Taichung, etc., will officially start sugar production from the 1st of this month to the end of the month. As for the remaining twenty-eight factories, except for Hengchun No. 11 Factory, which is actively repairing and unable to press sugarcane, most will start operations in mid-January next year. The total production volume can reach 300,000 tons. Although it has been affected by several typhoons and disputes over sugarcane planting area, due to sufficient fertilizer, the sugar content of sugarcane is higher than in previous years, so the predetermined goal can definitely be achieved. Of the various sugar-making equipment ordered by the sugar company from the United States with US$5 million, only 20% has been obtained due to transportation difficulties. As for the issue of exporting sugar to Japan, it was initially agreed to price it at US$300 per ton, but due to the low price of Cuban sugar shipped to Japan, it will be reduced to US$200. Currently, Sugar Company General Manager Shen will go to Shanghai to negotiate the signing of this contract.

"This session of the UNESCO was quite successful. Although the Chinese delegation was small in number, its members cooperated and worked hard, and were able to make some real contributions. However, previous preparation work has always been insufficient. I deeply hope that the Chinese Committee can jointly take responsibility and assist the government in researching, implementing, and promoting projects and initiatives related to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization. On our way back, we passed through the United States, where we were hosted by various Chinese and American groups and friends from Columbia and Harvard Universities. I deeply understood that the traditional friendship of the American people towards the Chinese people remains consistent. However, general perceptions are sometimes swayed by emotions, but are now becoming more realistic and forming a correct understanding, so as to adopt active policies. In Washington, we were hosted by friends from the Far East Division of the State Department's Cultural Division. They paid close attention to the Sino-American Cultural Agreement and hoped that it could truly promote cultural exchange. My planned inspection of the facilities and equipment lost by our country's cultural and educational institutions during the war has also been decided to be assisted in the restoration. Regarding the establishment of "Current Affairs" courses in American universities, Mr. Hang stated that the curriculum and educational system of American schools are undergoing different experiments.

### Commercial and Financial Figures in This City Review the Impact of Tightening Monetary Policy Although There Is a Huge Influx in National Banks, Prices Have Not Fallen Proportionately Tightening Monetary Policy Should Not Freeze Production Funds

[Reported by Our Newspaper] Some commercial and financial figures in this city recently expressed their opinions on the impact of the authorities' tightening of monetary policy and the large influx of funds into national banks on general industry, commerce, and prices, as follows. They believe that general commercial firms have now lost their powerful role as regulators of industrial, commercial, and financial affairs. Moreover, the deposits of general commercial firms are mostly excessive and not retained. Therefore, commercial firms are no longer the target if the authorities want to control prices and tighten monetary policy. Furthermore, in the past, the authorities often overemphasized the effectiveness of national bank loans. In fact, most of the loans of national banks require a two- or three-month review period, and the loans often fail to fully meet the needs of industry and commerce. Therefore, the greatest effectiveness of national bank loans is only to reduce the interest burden of industry and commerce. It is estimated that the total left loans of commercial firms in the city recently are only more than 2 trillion yuan. However, the total amount of the huge influx of funds into national banks in the past ten days has exceeded 1.2 trillion yuan. In principle, prices should have fallen sharply proportionally, but this is not the case in reality. Furthermore, due to domestic exchange restrictions, a large amount of cash from other cities flows to Shanghai and is repeatedly recovered by national banks. Therefore, the result of tightening monetary policy is only to provide opportunities for certain special classes whose funds are not affected by the tightening of monetary policy by national banks. Legitimate industry, commerce, and commercial firms, on the other hand, are directly hit by the tightening of monetary policy. They very much hope that the authorities, when tightening monetary policy, will take into account other factors at the same time, and especially pay attention to not freezing production funds.

In addition, there are newspapers and wood pulp, which are currently in demand. As for what our country can supply to the Soviet Union, tung oil has been the first in the past, followed by raw silk. However, the market for raw silk is getting better and better, and sales are booming. Therefore, unless the Soviet Union can offer a considerable high price, our country will probably not supply it. Pig bristles were also one of the goods transported to the Soviet Union in the past, but the Soviet side, after transporting them back to their country, resold them at low prices in the American and European markets in order to easily obtain US dollars. This point, from the Soviet Union's point of view, has its own certain national policy, but the export of pig bristles from our country is greatly affected. Now the sales of pig bristles in our country are very good, and there seems to be no reason to supply this commodity to the Soviet Union, thereby damaging our overseas market. Tea has also been a commodity transported to the Soviet Union, and if the other party needs it, it can still be supplied in the future. As for the size of the trade volume, because the Soviet Union's commerce is entirely controlled by the state, it is difficult to predict."

### Yellow Weasel Skin Prices Soar

Recently, the yellow weasel skin has been selling best in the fur market. Both local and foreign merchants are competing to purchase it, and prices are soaring. The selling price per pair has soared to a huge sum of 500,000 yuan. However, green goat skin is 140,000 yuan per piece, lake sheep skin is 160,000 yuan, and calico cat skin is 120,000 yuan, and there are very few inquiries. The market is stable.

[Reported by Our Newspaper] A large amount of wool is being shipped to the United States. The Fenmore of the Shuntin Shipping Company transported five tons of wool, thirteen tons of goose feathers, and two hundred and eighty tons of waste yarn from Shanghai to the United States yesterday.

### Authorities Determined to Strictly Ban Securities Firms Not Run By Brokers

[Reported by Our Newspaper] In this city, there are around two hundred securities firms or shops that are not run by certified brokers. Ordinarily, they solicit customers to buy and sell securities, mostly as intermediaries between brokers and customers. Their business has been quite prosperous. Recently, financial management authorities, due to the fact that many of the money exchange businesses that are being banned also engage in securities trading and often engage in over-the-counter transactions to evade transaction taxes, are going to ban securities firms that are not run by brokers.

Mr. Wang, the financial regulator stationed at the Securities Exchange, told reporters yesterday: Securities exchange brokers previously applied to the two ministries of finance and economics for permission to add branch offices and salespersons. In order to stabilize the financial situation, the two ministries have already approved a postponement of the discussion. Therefore, according to regulations, only approved securities exchange brokers can engage in the trading of listed securities. As for securities shops or firms not run by brokers, the Social Affairs Bureau has not yet approved their registration, so they do not have a legitimate status and should be banned. The supervision office of the two ministries has already investigated and prepared for the banning work, so as to cooperate with the Municipal Police Department to implement the ban.

### Jiangsu Branch of the National Treasury To Be Established on January 4th

[Reported by Our Newspaper] The new National Treasury disbursement accounting system of the Ministry of Finance, after being jointly revised and supplemented by relevant departments such as the National Treasury Bureau Accounting Office of the Central Bank, will be implemented from January of next year. The Central Bank, based on the current situation, has temporarily divided the country into nineteen regions and established nineteen regional branch treasuries to handle the account reports and other businesses of the branches within the jurisdiction of the Ministry, as reported in the previous newspaper. The business of the Jiangsu Regional Branch Treasury has been decided to be handled by the Shanghai Bureau of the National Treasury Bureau of the Central Bank itself. The preparation is proceeding very smoothly, and it will be established and opened on January 4th of next year. At that time, all banks and bureaus acting as national treasury agents in Jiangsu Province (including Beijing and Shanghai) will report the payment of various treasury funds for the 37th year in accordance with the new system regulations, and the Jiangsu Regional Branch Treasury will transfer the accounts to the General Treasury for inclusion in the treasury accounts.

### After Household Oil Is Distributed, China Vegetation Oil Plant Stops Allotment Sales

China Vegetation Oil Plant previously assisted the government in stabilizing oil prices by organizing the distribution of cooking oil. More than 600 retail cooking oil merchants in this city have been reviewed and qualified. At most, 200 barrels were allotted each day, and at least 100 barrels were allotted. Calculating with 200 barrels, it almost accounted for one-half of the city's daily oil. It is understood that the household oil in this city has begun to be distributed, and the project has no need to be allotted and sold again, and it has been announced on the 19th to stop the distribution.

### Production Increase Plan for the Paper Industry: Self-Sufficiency Possible in Three Years

[Report from Our Newspaper] After the National Economic Commission approved the paper industry production increase plan, all parties have attached great importance to it. Everyone believes that if this plan is implemented step by step, not only can the paper industry maintain its current status and overcome current difficulties, but it can also achieve self-sufficiency within three years. Recently, a person in the paper industry said: The government has already started implementing this plan, and it is expected that within three years, production will increase from the original 14,000 tons to 70,000 tons. However, he believes that the government should find ways to supply wood pulp. Of the 70,000-ton increase, half should be used as raw materials for the manufacture of white newsprint, and this city accounts for one-half of this number. If the wood pulp problem cannot be solved, not only will the production increase be affected, but all factories in Shanghai and Qingdao will inevitably reduce production or even shut down. After the paper mills are allocated wood pulp, the selling price of their paper should be based on cost plus a reasonable profit to avoid profiteering. Paper-making equipment should take this opportunity to reorganize and strengthen production capacity. The increased production should be used entirely for allocation to meet general needs. The government should allocate fuel supplies reasonably. Strengthen management work and hope that familiar paper industry organizations will participate in supervision.

### Dredging Coal Sources and Increasing Coal Production

When commodity prices are soaring without limit, most people believe that to stabilize prices, there must be a "fundamental solution." And the fundamental solution is to ensure the free flow of goods and increase production. Other measures can only provide temporary relief. However, at this stage, discussing increasing production can only be approached locally. To locally increase industrial production, the only way is to relax restrictions on industrial electricity use. Currently, the existing production capacity of Shanghai's industries seems to have the potential for growth. There are many cases of having the tools but being unable to produce. And the reason for this inability to produce is the lack of electricity. Since the victory, the country has been plagued by a coal shortage. The supply of electricity cannot be promoted without coal, so the crux of the problem lies in the supply of coal.

Reduced industrial production is closely related to commodity prices. Industrial production relies on the rate of industrial production to reduce the cost of finished products. Now, because of insufficient electricity, the speed of industrial production is gradually decreasing, so the cost of finished products cannot be reduced and will even increase. Whether the machines are running or not, the factory's expenses are the same. Moreover, because of insufficient production, consumption cannot be reduced, so the skyrocketing of prices is inevitable.

China's coal reserves rank third in the world, with a total of 217.6 billion metric tons. However, the output has been declining in recent years. Taking the two major coal-producing areas, Northeast and North China, as examples, the monthly output in the Northeast is about 300,000 tons. Due to the increasing war zone recently, the monthly output is only 70,000 tons. The output in North China is even lower than in the Northeast. The actual amount that can be produced is currently impossible to estimate accurately. The combined monthly output of other mines, including Taiwan, Huainan, Jiangxi, Tianhe, Pole, Yongxing, Xiangtan, Yizhang, Yuanhua, northern Guangdong, Yiluo, and eastern China mines, is at most 214,000 tons. Except for the coal used by the railways nearby, there is probably very little coal left for industrial use. Furthermore, due to traffic congestion, the produced coal is often piled up in the mining areas and cannot be transported out. The mines accumulate "coal" day by day, which cannot be shipped out, and the production funds cannot be turned around, eventually leading to a state of semi-paralysis.

The Shanghai-Nanjing area requires 250,000 tons of coal per month, plus 100,000 tons for railway use, totaling 350,000 tons. In winter, the extra coal consumption and the increased amount required in the heating rate due to the severe weather will account for more than double.

Southern coal has always relied heavily on supplies from the north, so now we still hope that the northern mining areas can actively increase production. At the same time, relief should be provided to the coal mines in the areas south of the Yellow River as soon as possible. Even more importantly, in terms of transportation, coal transport should be the top priority, because smooth sources will enable the funds of various mines to be turned around quickly, which will have a complementary effect on increasing coal production.

### About the TVA

— Han

The TVA was established on May 18, 1933, just a few months after President Roosevelt took office, when the country was in a recession. However, Roosevelt was willing to take on this dangerous and huge project amid a chorus of opposition.

Lilienthal was appointed to head the TVA in the spring of 1945, just as President Roosevelt was about to pass away. Therefore, the first difficult decision for President Truman after taking office was whether to continue to appoint Lilienthal as the head. Although many people opposed Lilienthal's reappointment, due to the unanimous public opinion of the people in the TVA area supporting Lilienthal, all plans ultimately remained unchanged.

Lilienthal sacrificed twenty times his salary in private enterprise to work for the TVA and was willing to work for public services.

The TVA has been established for fourteen years until this year. It has spent more than 750 million US dollars. There are a total of 26 great dams. The amount of earth, bricks, stones, and reinforced concrete used is enough to fill a large hole ten feet in diameter that runs through the earth from the United States to China.

The TVA is the first institution in the United States designed entirely by the federal government. It not only has the power to cross state boundaries, but it can also be free from the constraints of existing federal government agencies. It has autonomy and is only subject to congressional control. It can make its own decisions on administrative management. The decentralization of power is clear, so although the organization is large, problems that occur in various units in various places can be resolved locally immediately. There is no malpractice of official document travel, and there are no problems that are involved in real politics due to administration. All staff appointments and promotions are absolutely based on their merits, experience, and abilities.

In the first ten years after its establishment, the TVA had already raised the living standards of 3,225,000 people in the Tennessee Valley by 75%, and the average living standards of the people nationwide by 56%.

Its most significant achievement is rural electrification. There are now 125,000 farms in the TVA area that use electricity. Other achievements include the completion of 650 miles of navigable canals, a "soil hospital" network, 29,000 demonstration farms, newly developed fisheries, tannin factories, a lumber factory's wood utilization laboratory, 150 million newly planted trees, and successful anti-malarial campaigns.

The TVA organization is huge and complex, and everything applies the latest scientific theories and technologies, so it has had a great educational significance on society. It is like a large factory and even more like a university. All the staff are like faculty members. Their knowledge level is very high, comparable to that of the US Steel Corporation, the University of Chicago, and Harvard University. Because they are tasked with creating miracles, none of them is not doing their best for the public.

The area supplied by the TVA includes one-quarter of Kentucky, all of Tennessee, one-quarter of Alabama, one-third of Mississippi, one-tenth of Georgia, and a small part of North Carolina and Virginia.

The TVA's control of floods is a most powerful giant. The 1937 floods in the United States left millions homeless, and the 1943 floods destroyed millions of acres of farmland in four states, destroying 160,000 families. However, now these disasters have all been restrained and subdued by the power of the TVA! The TVA has also completed one of the most laudable tasks for mankind, that is, it has completely and absolutely broken away from the influence of political forces and laid the foundation for a detached and great engineering creation for mankind!

Let us sing loudly, what is the TVA like that joins the party!

### Supersonic Rocket Airplane

— Zheng Zuoqing

No airplane has ever been able to exceed the speed of sound, but according to recent experiments, the XS-1 aircraft, which uses rocket energy, can fly at 1,500 to 2,500 miles per hour, almost three times faster than the speed of sound.

This high-speed aircraft, which is one or two times faster than the speed of sound, naturally has an extraordinary structure. It has an unprecedentedly stronger fuselage that can withstand gravity eighteen times that of the earth's center of gravity. The XS-1 aircraft is the crystallization of cooperation between the US Air Force, Bell Aircraft Corporation, and the American Institute of Aeronautics.

Although it is a highly streamlined type, this high-pressure rocket aircraft still retains a considerable appearance of an aircraft. It has a pair of extremely thin wings made of aluminum alloy; in order to avoid unreliable welding, this wing is cut from a whole piece of aluminum alloy.

There are four engines inside the aircraft, using alcohol and liquid oxygen as fuel. Each engine can generate 1,500 pounds of thrust, so there is a total of 6,000 pounds of propulsion. One pound of thrust is equivalent to one horsepower at a speed of 375 miles per hour; for example, one pound of thrust is also equivalent to two horsepower at a speed of 750 miles per hour. The engine's power output therefore increases with its speed. The method of controlling power output is to use the method of resting some of the four engines and starting others, so when the pilot starts one engine, there will be 1,500 pounds of thrust, and when two are started, there will be 3,000 pounds; and so on, you can get 1500 4500; 6000; four different thrusts, so you can do whatever you want, adapt to the situation, and if a specially designed turbo-pump is completed, even slower speeds can be manipulated.

The aircraft is 31 feet long, 10 feet 10 inches high from the ground to the top of the tail, and has a smaller wingspan of only 28 feet. When empty, it weighs 4,892 pounds; of which, the instruments used for high-speed flight research weigh 526 pounds, but the rocket fuel weighs 8,177 pounds, which is more than one and a half times heavier than the empty aircraft. In order to save the weight of the fuel, a B-29 aircraft must first tow the XS-1 aircraft to a high altitude, and then it will start on its own to conduct experiments. Aircraft experimental reports show that although the aircraft can have a high speed of three times the speed of sound, it works best at an altitude of 80,000 feet.

### Red Leaves

— Wei Yuan

After you return from touring the lakes and mountains in autumn, I think you will definitely bring a few red leaves home. Then, when you clip them in a book or decorate them on your desk, you may recite the poem "I picked up an autumn from the wild."

Perhaps you have a courtyard at home with sycamore or maple trees. Then, in the quiet of early morning or evening, you may also have experienced the poetic meaning of "falling leaves silently" like the ancient poets' "falling flowers silently" under the sycamore or maple trees.

The reason I say this is because I want to tell you that red leaves—falling leaves—are a natural phenomenon, just like a green fruit ripens and it must fall off at some point, not necessarily because the wind blows it or someone picks it. Of course, when the wind blows, it is easier to fall off.

I don't know if you have noticed the base of the petiole of the red leaves you picked up. If you have paid attention, I think you will definitely be surprised, because the bases are all very smooth planes. It doesn't look like a fracture surface.

This surface is the origin of the red leaves.

The occurrence of this surface is as follows: On the petiole of an ordinary leaf, there are two mechanical tissues (Collenchyma) on the upper part of a concave defect, because the two mechanical tissues, like two iron sheets, are attached, the leaves are like having their seat belts and are very difficult to be blown off the branches by the wind. However, when the autumn wind blows on the earth, the climate has begun to cool down and become dry. There is too little moisture in the air, which will cause the moisture in the leaves to run outward. The moisture often runs outward, so not only can the photosynthesis of the leaves (the process of water and carbon dioxide synthesizing carbohydrates in chlorophyll in the sun) not proceed, but it will also cause the phenomenon of backflow of water in the body—the water in the plant body runs out, which is the ultimate threat to plant life—just like humans can have life-threatening dangers from vomiting and diarrhea and excessive water loss.

Do plants just sit and wait to die like this? No, they have very subtle effects—leaf fall prevents this threat. This effect occurs at the base of the petiole:

The base of the petiole is originally composed of tough permanent tissue. When the autumn wind rises, that part slowly becomes an active meristem (Secondary Meristem). This meristem gradually forms a layer of disorganized (Abscission layer) parenchyma tissue at the base of the petiole. Due to the formation of this abscission layer, the mechanical tissues and large and small leaf veins are completely separated. Leaf veins can send moisture, and once they are broken, the water route is also cut off, so the water in the plant body does not need to be lost too much and cause death. Since the water has run from the leaves into the dry air, and there is no source of regaining it, the leaves gradually begin to lose their green years. Waiting for the day when the force of the leaves growing on the branches is extremely small, the leaves leave the branches. Of course, this phenomenon of leaf fall, which disregards the existence or non-existence of the small self for the safety of the mother body, has its profound meaning.

Of course, some people will still ask: What about the leaf blade turning red?

It's like this: Plant cells contain plastids. Plastids can be divided into leucoplasts (Leacoplas) and chloroplasts (Chloroplasts). The (leucoplasts can become green and other pigments, which can be seen from the white core of the cauliflower). Chloroplasts can be divided into chlorophyll, xanthophyll, and carotene. These several kinds of pigments often vary with different environments (for example, the leaves of maple trees can have several colors). The closer to green the pigment is, the more beneficial it is to photosynthesis, and the closer to red it is, the more opposite the effect is. Therefore, when the leaves of a tree feel that they should not be doing photosynthesis during a period of water shortage, the reddish pigments inside it gradually increase. The reason why maple leaves become red leaves, while sycamore only are yellow withered cases, is all due to this reason.

Finally, I hope you cherish your red leaves, they are full of poetry and romance!

Scientific Discussion

### Sinicization of Number Grouping

— Zhou Shimin

When we write down a long string of numbers, for example, 6,390,000,000, in order to make it easier to recognize its units, we put a (,) every three digits from the last digit. This is what I mean by the number grouping mark. Perhaps many people have not deeply considered this issue, and have always used a mechanical memorization, recognizing that the digit before the first mark represents the "thousands" place, the second mark is "millions" (Million), the third mark is "billions" (Billion), and so on. In fact, this kind of memorization is indeed a burden and very inconvenient for a Chinese learner. At least when I personally and many friends and colleagues I have contacted want to recognize a long string of numbers, these marks do not provide us with any convenience, so I propose this suggestion for improvement, hoping to be more suitable for our country's habits and system, that is, to emphasize Sinicization.

Before talking about the improvement method, we may as well first investigate why we adopted this unconventional grouping method in the past, which is helpful for us to further seek the motivation for the improvement method. Undoubtedly, we copied the Western set of number grouping methods without any changes, almost swallowing them whole. In fact, this grouping method does have convenient places in other countries. Taking England as an example, the units of advancement are ten, hundred, thousand, million, trillion, etc. There are no separate marks for "ten thousand" and "ten thousand ten thousand". Therefore, 40000 is called "forty thousand". 800,000,000 is called "eight hundred million", and therefore the first grouping mark is before the third digit, and the second grouping mark is before the sixth digit. In English reading, this is indeed relatively convenient.

But this method is naturally only applicable to a certain system. When it comes to China, a country with a "ten thousand" unit, we would never call four ten thousand "forty thousand", would we? For a high school or college student with a relatively good level of English, perhaps after a moment of hesitation, they can smoothly read a long string of numbers, but for children in junior high school or even elementary school, and to more broadly consider the people who have not studied English but must use numbers, must we insist on this foreign grouping method? Shouldn't we "possibly" establish a rule suitable for our national system?

The method is that simple: we use the relationship of the highest unit "ten thousand" that is reached in ordinary situations, and change from spacing three digits to spacing four digits. The first grouping mark is placed before the fourth digit, and the unit of the digit before it is "ten thousand". The second grouping mark is placed before the eighth digit according to the base-four system, and the digit before the second grouping mark is "ten thousand ten thousand". The third grouping mark is placed before the twelfth digit, the unit is "ten thousand ten thousand ten thousand"... and so on.

A group of thousands (that is, four digits) sandwiched between every two grouping marks, in addition to adding units such as "ten thousand" or "ten thousand ten thousand" according to the situation where the grouping mark is located, the reading method is naturally the same as in ordinary situations, without having to consider it. It is clear at a glance. The following example is extremely simple and can express our meaning more clearly.

Before this kind of question is raised, perhaps it is felt that there is no value in paying attention to it. After it is raised, it also appears extremely ordinary and superficial, but I hope that everyone will adopt it uniformly to establish our country's own system. Its convenience and importance are threefold: first, it can avoid irregular memorization. Second, the improvement is helpful for the popularization of science. Third, and most importantly, we cannot always have the idea of following others. We should strive to be self-reliant, establish our own scientific system, and make contributions to world academia.

Scientific Ramblings

### Flying Fish

— Qu Youding

In the seas of warmer climates, flying fish often appear, which is a great miracle of nature and has long been noticed by biologists. Although this phenomenon is common, it is not easy to obtain accurate observations. What is usually seen with the naked eye is nothing more than schools of fish suddenly leaping out of the water, gliding for two or three seconds, and then safely returning to the water. After scholars of physics used new observation methods such as photography, they recently learned that when flying, they do not flap their "wings" like birds, but are only gliding.

Fish Body Structure There are four types of fish that can fly, but the easiest to see and the best at flying are the Cypsemrus tribe of the Exocoetodae family. Their pectoral and pelvic fins are more suitable for flying. These fish live close to the sea surface and swim quickly; their bodies are streamlined and they have huge eyes, similar to mackerel. Their streamlined bodies are not only suitable for flying, but also for fast swimming. The surface of the abdomen is smooth, so as to rise and fall at any time. The shape of the tail is the same as that of ordinary fish, also in a V shape; however, the lower part of the V shape is longer, almost one and a half times that of the upper half, because this kind of tail shape is of great help to flight. More important are the paired fins, which become wings, which are the most obvious adaptation to flight; the pectoral fins are about two-thirds of the total length of the body, and the area when unfolded is almost twice the area of the abdomen. When swimming, the pectoral fins are close to the body, and when flying, they extend almost horizontally across the entire body. The back of the fin is composed of a thin film, with ten to twelve ray-like ribs supporting it. The pelvic fins are much smaller than the pectoral fins, mostly in a quadrangular shape, and their other structures are similar to the pectoral fins.

Flight Circumstances When starting to fly, the fish break through the water surface at high speed of swimming. This high speed is estimated to be about fifteen to twenty miles per hour. And from the photos taken, it is known that when the fish emerge from the water, their bodies are almost parallel to the water surface and not vertical. In a moment, they fly into the air, then the pectoral fins immediately unfold, and the pelvic fins are retracted. In this way, because the support force obtained by the tail is less than that of the head, the fish body forms an angle of about fifteen degrees with the water surface, and the lower half of the tail blade gradually remains in the water; moving forward along the water surface in this position is called "takeoff". During takeoff, the tail swings violently in the water at a speed of about fifty times per second; this speed increases further until the air speed is reached and then stops. As for how high the airspeed is, there are many different estimates—from about thirty-five miles to fifty-five miles per hour; however, according to photos taken by ordinary motion picture cameras, the speed should be twenty-five to thirty miles per hour. However, this may only be the speed close to the end of gliding, because the speed is too high when just emerging from the water to be photographed, so forty miles per hour should be the best estimate of its initial gliding speed.

During takeoff, the fish's body inevitably trembles due to the violent swinging of the tail, especially its wings (pectoral fins) (but it does not flap its wings). After the airspeed is reached, the pelvic fins are also unfolded, and the fish body is further parallel to the water surface, with a slope of only about six degrees; at the same time, the tail exits the water. From this point on, it glides at equal height with a distance of about one foot from the water, and the speed gradually decreases. However, in order to maintain the same height while the speed decreases, the angle between the two wings and the horizontal plane must continue to increase. When the airspeed is lost, either the fish body immediately falls into the water, or the pelvic fins are contracted again and again, and the lower part of the tail falls into the water and swings violently, so it regains the high speed of "takeoff" and glides a second time. This kind of re-takeoff situation is often seen: and there are those who glide repeatedly up to ten times.

Usually, their gliding can last for three or four seconds, but sometimes it is shorter; according to several observations by Hobbs, the estimated average flight time is 2.6 seconds (including "takeoff" time). However, some people have observed records of ten to thirteen seconds, which should be very rare. As for the distance of flight, it obviously varies with wind force and wind direction; in calm air, the average gliding distance is about forty to fifty feet, but there is also an estimate of one hundred yards. For exceptional glides of more than ten seconds, the distance should be greater. The speed at the end of its flight is about twenty-five miles per hour.

Scientific Vocabulary

### Cadmium Rod

— Bao Zhongqi

——Atomic Energy Controller

The English name for the cadmium rod is Cadmiumrod. Its name doesn't seem to appear frequently in newspapers and magazines, but it is the nemesis of the invincible atomic bomb, even more important than instruments like the cyclotron.

As the name suggests, a cadmium rod is a long rod made of a cadmium substance. It has a special property—the ability to absorb neutrons. Because of this characteristic, it is used in experiments testing atomic energy.

American atomic energy experts initially experimented with atomic fission at the University of Chicago's testing ground. They bombarded Uranium atoms with neutrons, causing them to split and produce two or three neutrons and a large amount of energy. The resulting neutrons then created a chain reaction with other Uranium atoms, generating a vast amount of atomic energy.

However, the uranium atoms that can be broken down by neutrons are uranium-235, while ordinary uranium ore is mostly uranium-238. The content of uranium-235 is very low.

Therefore, scientists tried to separate these two isotopes, but because they have the same chemical properties, they are not easy to separate. To solve this difficulty, a new hypothesis was established: if uranium-238 could be converted into other elements, separation would be easier.

So, in a pile of graphite (note) and uranium ore spaced apart, scientists used neutrons passed through graphite to bombard uranium-238. The result was similar to the fission of uranium-235: two new elements were produced—neptunium and plutonium—along with a large amount of energy and neutrons.

These neutrons are the key to revealing the tiny and mysterious atomic universe. They can cause the nuclei of uranium-235 and plutonium to split. The explosion of the atomic bomb is due to this basic concept. Without the invention of the cadmium rod, if the neutrons were out of control and their numbers soared to a considerable proportion, the University of Chicago's experimental site would have been destroyed long ago. Then, no one could say when the atomic bomb would be invented, perhaps centuries later.

Regarding the defense against the radiation energy of atomic bombs, American scientists may be conducting further research on cadmium rods!

Note: The application of graphite is to reduce the speed of neutrons because low-speed neutrons easily cause fission.

### In Memory of Zhang Bo Lao

—

Zhang Pu Lao (Ji) was the first person to spread revolutionary ideas in academic circles. It was during the late Qing Guangxu period when Liang Rengong's Xinmin Congbao and the Minbao, hosted by Zhang, engaged in a war of words. These two newspapers were banned items in the mainland at the time. They were either sent directly to the school by friends studying in Japan, or secretly purchased and read by others. Although Hu Hanmin and Zhang Taiyan mostly wrote the essays that confronted Liang head-on, the publisher was the famous "Zhang Ji." As a result, the earliest and most widespread impression of Zhang among young people was formed.

In 1928, the National Revolutionary Army pacified Beiping, unifying China. Zhang served as the chairman of the first political affairs committee and the chairman of the board of Pingmin University. He had an old friendship with the president, Wang Bo Lao (Dabian) (Zhang studied in Japan, and Wang served as the supervisor of students studying in Japan, and later as the ambassador to Japan, greatly valuing Zhang). Therefore, he was very enthusiastic about school affairs and attended every school affairs meeting in person. The faculty and staff actually admired this revolutionary veteran, who they thought possessed the heroic spirit to repel thousands, but he was actually simple, peaceful, and amiable. When I mentioned the past event of reading Minbao in the school, he attributed the credit to Hanmin and Taiyan.

"Broad forehead and large ears, tiger head 　　," one can still see the true nature of Zhao's generous and tragic songs. His ancestral home is Cangzhou, a major station on the Tianjin-Pukou Railway in Tianjin, a "busy, important, and difficult" position. It is one of the three famous prefectures in Hebei (Zhuozhou, Tongzhou, Cangzhou), formerly known as "Changlu," bordering the Bohai Sea along with Yanshan, Qingyun, and Wuding in Shandong, with many heroic figures, strong customs, and robust physiques. At the Sixth Plenary Session of the Capital in 1935, Wang's bodyguard encountered an obstruction, and Zhang Ji hugged the assassin around the waist, showing his courageous and enthusiastic spirit. In critical moments, his nature was naturally revealed, worthy of the strength of the North. Later, Wang became a traitor, and Pu Lao deeply regretted blocking the assassin in the first place, leaving him alive to do evil.

In the early days of the Restoration, Zhang and Lu Zhonglin served as envoys of appeasement, touring Yan and Ji, comforting the disaster-stricken people, and giving considerable comfort to those in the occupied areas. Yesterday, I heard that this old man suddenly died of angina pectoris on the night of the sixteenth, at the age of sixty-six (Wu Peifu also died at the age of sixty-six in 1939), which was quite unexpected, as he was healthy, strong, and simple, with the appearance of someone over eighty. However, the general authors of Minbao, Hu and Zhang, are long gone, and with this, the flow of blood has stopped.

### Winter Solstice Night

— Ruyi

The rapid scenery is fading, and it is already the Winter Solstice in the blink of an eye. This year's Winter Solstice Festival happens to be the day before Christmas Eve. The Chinese and Western festivals follow one another, making people feel even more that "the year is coming to an end." Another difficult year has passed!

"The Winter Solstice is as important as the New Year." The night before the Winter Solstice is the happiest time for family reunions; however, with the freezing weather and the cessation of warfare, even the most optimistic people can't help but shrink back, right?

I thought of the coal shortage in England, and I thought of the British spirit of "chin up" in times of adversity. This is truly a spirit worthy of emulation. In today's world, the so-called escape from reality by scholars and officials hiding in the mountains and forests is absolutely impossible. Rather than indulging in the imaginary Shangri-La, it is better to face reality bravely; do less grandstanding and more down-to-earth work. Knowing that there are many difficulties ahead, knowing that there are many stumbling blocks on the road; however, if you don't encounter difficulties, you won't have the joy of overcoming them.

Carp in a dried rut, moistening each other, in this coldest time, let us comfort each other, encourage each other, let us choose this most difficult time to make up our minds, things are up to people, and next year should be better than this year!

### Talking About Turkey

— Zhou Xingchu

Christmas is coming again, and beautiful and pleasing turkeys are on the market in due season. According to Western customs, turkey must be included in the dishes of this Christmas Day to celebrate. Some people regard it as one of the gifts to give to relatives and friends.

Turkey is the common name for the toothed bird. The term toothed bird is not as well known as turkey. It also has names such as guinea fowl, white heron, and filial crow. It originated in North America and has been raised since ancient times. It is said that turkey was introduced to Europe in 1499 AD.

Li Shizhen of the Ming Dynasty said in the Compendium of Materia Medica: "Firebirds are produced in the mountains of Ba Gorge, Min and Guang. People mostly play with them. They are as large as domestic chickens and as small as birds. Their heads and cheeks are like pheasants, and their feathers are mostly black, mixed with yellow and white spots like pearls. They have sacs under their necks, which contain fleshy streamers. They are usually invisible. Every spring and summer, when the weather is clear, they face the sun and swing them. Two green horns first emerge from the top, about two inches long, and then slowly unfold the streamers under their foreheads, which are nearly a foot long, alternating between red and green, with brilliant colors. After a while, they disappear." Liu Yuxi of the Tang Dynasty wrote in a poem: "Yue Mountains have birds soaring in the vastness, the light of the streamers in the middle of the sky is bright. The Yue people saw them occasionally and were amazed by them, so they named them toothed birds, which are known in Jiangnan. Siming Tianmu is a land of gods and immortals, and the essence of Zhu Bird is endowed with strange qi. Red jade is carved into brilliant feathers, and red silk is cut into exquisite wings. The lake smoke begins to clear and the mountain sun is high, facing the wind and spouting streamers to coil flower ribbons, reflecting the waves and dyeing the turquoise grass, suspecting that Queen Mother's peach blossoms are blooming by the leaves…" From this poem, we can see that China already had turkeys in the Tang Dynasty. According to the Dutch, the bird is called Tangguo Bird, so it was produced in our country. The Japanese call it the seven-faced crow because its head and forehead are bare, its skin is warty, and there is fleshy meat at the base of its upper beak, hanging under its beak, which can change color from time to time.

Currently, the turkey breeding ground in our country is Dinghai, Zhejiang. There is also an international historical fact behind its production of turkeys. During the Opium War in the Daoguang period of the Qing Dynasty, the British occupied Dinghai and brought many turkeys. After the British army left, they left the turkey species behind. The local villagers thought that the turkey was beautiful in shape, the meat was fresh and fat, and it was valuable, so they raised them one after another, spreading to this day. The output has increased year by year, and the turkey has become a specialty of Dinghai.

The meat of the turkey is tougher than that of the domestic chicken and extremely dry, which is not to the taste of the Chinese. However, Europeans and Americans say that its taste is endless, far better than the fat and fresh domestic chicken, no wonder they regard it as a precious delicacy once a year.

The average American turkey weighs more than twenty pounds, while the heaviest in our country weighs only more than ten pounds, and the average is only four or five pounds. The difference in achievement is entirely due to the lack of attention to breeding. If we improve it and use scientific methods to raise it, we can compete with imported products and supplement the livelihoods of farmers.

### Linked Phrases

— Wang Baili

The Zhang Qiaoyang Temple in Zhongzi Mountain, Taizhou, has a linked phrase: "With full of emotion, he vowed to fight, guarding Suiyang, the most important area, in the isolated city, everyone was happy to die; calmly fulfilling his integrity, shaking the heroic spirit of Hebei, a thousand years later, his appearance is still lifelike." (See Lenglu Miscellany) Reading it, one can imagine the situation of that day.

When I was young, I studied in Wenzhou and occasionally visited Jiangxin Temple. I saw a linked phrase on the temple gate: "Clouds rise and fall every morning, rising and falling every morning, rising and falling scattering; tides rise and fall forever, rising and falling forever, rising and falling diminishing." It is said that it was written by Wang Meixi, the Zhuangyuan of the Song Dynasty, when he was studying in the temple. I don't know if it's true. The way to read it is quite difficult to understand. I think the first "rising" character is in the upper level tone, the second "rising" character is in the lower level tone, the third and fourth are both in the upper level tone, the fifth is in the lower level tone, the sixth is in the upper level tone, the seventh is in the lower level tone, and the eighth is in the upper level tone. The lower phrase is in the rising tone, the third and fourth are both in the level tone, the fifth is rising, the sixth is level, the seventh is rising, and the eighth is level. I have punctuated it like this, I don't know if there are other ways to read it? I hope readers will teach me. Recently, I saw Liang Zhangju's Continued Talks on Wandering, mentioning this linked phrase, but he did not punctuate it, only saying that he had witnessed this linked phrase forty-three years ago and left it alone because it was difficult to understand. It can be seen that this linked phrase is not only understood in this way. I heard from my teacher Zhou Zhiqiao that there is another linked phrase in the temple, also written by Meixi: "The twin towers are towering, like drumsticks hitting the white sun; the city is surrounded, growing teeth to bite the blue sky." In Jiangxin Temple, one can see the surrounding city of Wenzhou, and at each end of the isolated island (the location of Jiangxin Temple, the name of the isolated island is not very famous, and the villagers generally refer to it as Jiangxin Temple) there is a tower. Being there, one knows that this linked phrase is extremely appropriate and wonderful. I heard the linked phrase first, and then visited the temple, but I could not find it anywhere. I asked the people who were traveling with me at the time, and they all said they had not seen it. However, this linked phrase must be in Jiangxin Temple. If it is moved to another place, it will not be appropriate. And Liang Zhangju's Continued Talks on Wandering records the most detailed linked phrases of Wenzhou's scenic spots, but it does not mention this linked phrase. I don't know why, so I will record it for a later visit.

### Tonic

— Jingwen

Commercial advertisements are the most seasonal. Looking at the advertisements in the newspapers these days, I know that it is the season for "taking tonics." There are many kinds of tonics, such as Jilin ginseng, official swallow's nest, old Hong Kong pearl powder, and seasonal tonics. In addition, cod liver oil and various vitamins also belong to this category.

The human body has the function of metabolism, which is common sense that everyone knows. If a machine breaks down, it needs to be repaired with another part. Although it is not convenient to replace parts when the human body breaks down, it also needs to be repaired, which is called "taking tonics." Moreover, the function of "taking tonics" is said to be not only after the fact, but also to have a preventive effect. The so-called prolonging life and benefiting the marrow, which is often seen in tonic advertisements, is this meaning.

However, no matter how great the effect of tonics is, they are ultimately just medicine; according to medical common sense, it is a last resort for a person to take medicine. It is best to "be fortunate enough to avoid medicine." If it is necessary to take medicine, it is also reasonable to "prescribe the right medicine for the disease."

But many people nowadays have different views on "medicine"; things like paste tonics, ginseng regeneration pills, and cod liver oil are regarded as common tonics. Even various vitamin pills that should be used after a doctor examines the body, as well as various tonic injections, and even the milk and other foods that Europeans and Americans eat every day, are regarded by some people as tonics or supplements. Regarding milk and eggs as "supplements" certainly shows the food shortage of our people's livelihood, but on the other hand, seeing the abundance of national quintessence tonics cannot help but make people feel that our people are mostly sick.

Because people who can afford tonics now are probably those who have good nutrition and lifestyle in normal times and do not need urgent "medical tonics." The reason why they are willing to spend a lot of money to buy bitter water to drink is nothing more than the idea of "prolonging life and benefiting the marrow." In other words, it is groaning without illness. And groaning without illness is precisely a serious social disease among our nation.

A few years ago, Europeans and Americans advocated the saying "life begins at forty." Now they are further discussing "life begins at seventy or eighty." The meaning is that a person's real life should begin around the age of forty or fifty, and even at seventy or eighty, he is still strong and has a lot to offer.

But in our country, it is different. The so-called thirty "establishment," forty "no confusion," and then it is "knowing fate," and it should be "preparing the coffin" to wait for "dying in peace." Since our concept of life is so "prematurely aging," how can there not be many people in society who groan without illness, and how can our nation avoid the ridicule of being "sick men"?

This is not to say that tonics should not be eaten; people with insufficient nutrition should eat more cod liver oil or some kind of gelatin. It is best that everyone can regard milk and eggs as common meals. But being too superstitious about the so-called "tonics" and making the vitality of life weak and forming a social atmosphere lacking in progress is "more harm than good."

### Carefree Flower

— Chen Shenyan

Chapter 5 An Unexpected Calamity (3)

Zhu thought again and again that Qiwan was struggling for the sake of art, and was not different from sacrificing her beauty. How painful it was for a beautiful woman like a flower to be paired with an ugly ghost with incorrect facial features! Thinking about it, he felt very unfair and couldn't help but stand up. Seeing this, Little Wang's mother was shocked and asked, "Mr. Xu, are you leaving?" When Zhu Zhai was reminded by her, he pretended to have difficulty walking again, limping and saying, "Yes, I'm leaving." Little Wang's mother said, "Slow down, slow down! I'll get the car." After going out for a while, she came back and said, "The car is here." Zhu Zhai took out a few banknotes from his pocket and stuffed them into Little Wang's mother's hand, saying, "Thank you. Don't tell her when the boss comes back." Little Wang's mother held the banknotes and refused to accept them. Zhu Zhai had already limped out of the gate, got into the car and left. The rickshaw puller was an old man, holding the handlebars with both hands, like an old ox, walking slowly step by step. Zhu Zhai was in the car, thinking about Qiwan's situation, feeling very sad. He thought that drama was originally a specialized art. Although the status of actors is higher than before, the general people who appreciate art are not as kind as before. Twenty years ago, any actor with artistic talent who could be cultivated would be cultivated by a music connoisseur, promoting his art. Like the current Mei, Cheng, Xun, and Shang, who can form their own schools, they were all recognized and cultivated by several famous scholars and wealthy people at that time to reach their current status. They upheld the friendship of righteousness, all helping people to become famous, without other purposes. Now the human heart is not as it used to be, and everything is selfish and self-interested. The so-called corner master spends a sum of money and must earn back all the principal and interest to satisfy his desires. A person with artistic talent like Qiwan, if recognized by a famous master twenty years ago, could have increased her value tenfold. Why should she be so pitiful now, bowing and submitting to others for some extra props? Her ambition is commendable, and her situation is also sad! What I regret is that I don't have this ability. Although there is a small amount of property at home, it is under the control of my old father and cannot be moved. Otherwise, I will do my best to supply Qiwan and achieve her future. If she follows the current situation and drifts with the tide, her will will easily weaken and she will easily degenerate. I met her by chance, and she treated me like an old friend at first sight, telling me all her heartfelt words, which shows that she has a loyal heart. She kept saying that I was honest and recognized me as her confidant. I can't help her, and I really feel ashamed. That night, the bright moon was in the sky, and the rickshaw was walking very slowly. Because Zhu Zhai's mind was lingering with Qiwan, he didn't notice that the rickshaw puller was an old man, letting him walk step by step, and he didn't think he was walking slowly. Looking at the moon, he recalled the situation of whispering and cherishing with Qiwan in the park, feeling very emotional. What I regret is that I met her too late. If I had met her half a year ago, I would not have married yet, and there might have been a possibility of a good flower and a full moon. It can be seen that the heavens are too teasing, and nothing is satisfactory. Zhu Zhai was looking up at the moonlight, fantasizing, when he suddenly heard a scream, and couldn't help but be stunned.

### Empty Fame

— Jiyong

Li Bai was the first to oppose fame, although he was not very indifferent to profit. "I only wish to have a glass of wine before I die, why bother with fame for a thousand years"? The words are very optimistic, but they are not very consistent with his person. Why did he seek He Zhizhang and Gao Lishi, and why did he join Yong Wang Lin, so he became a complaining person who could not achieve anything. Liu Yong wrote a sentence "I can't bear to exchange my floating name for a shallow drink and low singing," losing the jinshi title on the list of released candidates. It can also be called the extreme of literary inquisition. However, what they said all belong to the "hermit type" of Taoist thought, not the original meaning of this topic.

The so-called empty fame here is something "unearned." There are no lack of people in the world who get undeserved praise, and a knock on their truth often brings unexpected disappointment, especially in politics, where books often differ greatly from reality. Zhang Duanyi's Noble Ear Collection Volume 1 contains a passage:

"Scholars and officials are most afraid of having empty fame. If empty fame prevails, it is not a blessing for the court. Zhen Xishan bore the great name of the world. How could Xishan really want to love fame in the world? The world naturally respects him when they hear his name. When Shi Tongshu died, people all over the world said: If Zhiyuan enters the court, peace in the world can be expected. When he entered the court, his previous reputation was slightly reduced... There is a saying in the capital: If you want all things to be cheap, you must have Zhen Zhiyuan. When he is called, he stirs it into a mass of noodles! In this way, fame is one thing, and career is another. The land in Jiangnan is shallow, and scholars and officials can only do one thing, not two."

This is a great blow to those who love "orthodox writing." Yijianmian, this word is still used by northerners today, or changed to guo, which means chaotic. Xishan was the leader of Song learning, and his achievements were only so-so. No wonder later people scolded Taoists for only being able to "talk about morality with their hands in their sleeves when nothing happens, and die to repay the emperor in times of crisis"?

However, it is not just this. I remember that Zhou Mi's Kueixin Miscellany contained many articles scolding Taoism. There is an appendix to the end of the Song and Yuan Xue'an, and Li Yueman also praised it in his diary. Unfortunately, it is not at hand, so I cannot copy it. I only remember that it was because they were too hypocritical. Before encountering difficulties, scholars and officials often have a set of hypocritical magic weapons, such as the so-called "cannon" is also. But when they come to power, they will also let profit "blind" the Tao. The holy scriptures and virtuous biographies will be forgotten by all. Why was Xie Jin not a Confucian scholar in the early Ming Dynasty? On the one hand, he made a big fuss about dying for Jianwen's country, and on the other hand, he asked in detail whether the piglets had been fed today. It is laughable and sighable, which is why I disrespect Confucian scholars.

However, there are many short-sighted people in the world. For a cannon that is loud and loud, they can't help but look at it with surprise and express admiration. But they completely forget the famous saying of Franklin that they read every day: "Great-talkers are little doers." Isn't that terrible? This opens another path for ambitious people. The cannon can be fired loudly and especially loudly, and then fame and wealth will come gurglingly.

Zhang Duanyi was from Zhengzhou and lived in Suzhou. The previous words could not help but be disrespectful to the southern compatriots. Only in the Song Dynasty, southerners were not allowed to be prime ministers and top scholars, which was a system established at the beginning of the country. Later, it was divided into two factions. Sima Guang, the conservative faction, was from the north, and Wang Anshi, the reformist faction, was from the south. Qian Binsi said that Cai Jing's party was mostly southerners (see Outline of National History), or Zhang was also talking about it with emotion? Now we naturally no longer have regional concepts, but in the Qing Dynasty, the Yan-Li school, which rose suddenly, focused on practice, and opposed empty reputation, was the authentic predecessor of Baoding Prefecture and Chuxi Chun's hometown. This can also be deeply considered.

I ask you: How many of the famous people you have always admired have not disappointed you?

### Age Calculation Method

— Ge Chunliang

A London socialite once asked Bernard Shaw, "How old do you think I am this year?"

Bernard Shaw said, "Judging from your teeth, I should say you are only eighteen years old; judging from your permed hair, you are only nineteen years old; judging from your attitude, you are only fourteen years old."

That woman was very happy and said, "Thank you for your kind words, but how old do you think I am in the end?"

Bernard Shaw said, "Ah, isn't that easy to calculate? Add eighteen, nineteen, and fourteen together, and the answer is fifty-one years old."

### Flower and Grass Records (1)

— Mengnong

The Injured Chrysanthemum

I sold two chrysanthemums, but there are only empty pots at home. This is really a bit embarrassing. How can they survive? Seeing these two chrysanthemums with roots but no soil wither away alive is really unbearable, so I had to rack my brains to find a way for them.

I thought of a pair of empty bottles in the corner of the easel. I brushed off the thin dust and filled them with clear water, maybe I could save the chrysanthemums' lives. With this thought, the two chrysanthemums finally had a place to settle down. One was planted in a magnetic pot, and the other was offered in a bile bottle, both becoming small decorations in my home in autumn and winter.

After a few days, looking at the two small decorations, the issue of survival or life suddenly broke out in secret. The chrysanthemum in the pot was originally placed on the windowsill, where it could enjoy the wind, drink dew, and naturally bask in the sun. Unexpectedly, one day, a strong wind suddenly blew. The window was attacked by the strong wind and knocked over the chrysanthemum. Some of the petals were injured and gradually died; however, the most amazing thing is that some of the petals that were not injured grew larger and stronger day by day. This shows that they are developing a glorious and more powerful line of life under the destructive state.

Looking back at the scene of the chrysanthemum in the bile bottle, a general atmosphere of vying for beauty is also emerging in front of me. Although the roots are broken, the leaves are sparse, the flowers are broken, and even the shadow of the soil is not seen, leaving only a little bit of clear water, but the chrysanthemum, broken here, does not just wither away. Like wild grass in rock crevices, it is gushing out the power of survival in twists and turns. "The chrysanthemum has just bloomed, and a branch is lightly broken off and brought back. It is a pity that its heart has not died, and it still opens in the bile bottle!"

If I were a poet, I would definitely write such lines as my lament for the fate of the potted chrysanthemum.

### Seeing the Big Picture from the Small

— Ji'er

Eminent predecessors often have a preconceived notion when judging people, which is "seeing the big picture from the small." Although "a prodigy at a young age may not necessarily be great later in life," it seems that if one is not outstanding when young, they will certainly not be great later on. The accuracy of such foresight is quite debatable, but it is not without considerable reason. Therefore, the older generation liked to use this approach; I wonder if it is still common today.

My maternal uncle told me that when he went to the capital to take the imperial examinations, he was still young. At that time, Weng Changshu was the Prime Minister. All the young men from his hometown who came to the capital to take the examinations and paid him a courtesy visit were received, and he never refused requests for calligraphy works or couplets. Therefore, my uncle also paid him a visit. That day, there were not many people in the inner hall. Someone suggested playing cards, and Changshu asked him to join the game while he stood by and watched. After a while, the game ended, and Changshu said to my uncle, "Young people should avoid being harsh. I see that you are quite kind!" It seems that mahjong can also be used to observe a person's character, which is to see the "big" from the "small." Generally, a person's temperament is most easily revealed unconsciously. When playing cards, one inevitably becomes elated and loses control, thus revealing their true nature. This may have the same meaning as observing a person's character through their handwriting.

In addition, writers often like to "see the big picture from the small" in their writing. In ancient times, many people developed grand theories from everyday trivial matters, especially during the Qing Dynasty, such as Zheng Banqiao's family letters. However, some criticized this as "making too much of small things." Recently, articles in newspapers and magazines mostly belong to this "seeing the big picture from the small" category, first discussing trivial matters and then expressing grand theories, which is quite representative of the current trend. For if one does not "see the big picture from the small," then what else can one do?
