### Zhang Qun Urges Shenyang Citizens to Uphold Sovereignty and Build the Northeast; Inspects Factories and Mines in Fushun

[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 20th] Zhang Qun, accompanied by Guan Jiyu, Xie Shuying, and others, departed for Fushun at 8:00 AM on the 20th to visit coal mines, power plants, and oil refineries. Faced with the grand scene of industrial and mining sites, he listened attentively to explanations. He returned to Shenyang at 4:00 PM and attended a welcome rally at the Municipal Government Square. In his speech to the people and students, Zhang stated that many Northeast compatriots were born in hardship and died in hardship. People aged fifty have experienced four international wars, while those younger have experienced one or two. The Northeast has three treasures: ginseng, leopard skin, and *Acanthopanax senticosus*, but they are not in our hands. Besides these, we have our true three treasures: land, people, and sovereignty, which must be recovered. Achieving the true unification of China is the responsibility of the Northeast compatriots, and it is also the responsibility of the entire nation. He hoped that Northeast compatriots would strengthen themselves, understand the environment and the current situation, and build a new Northeast.

[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 20th] Premier Zhang said in his speech at the people's welcome rally: "There are two famous sayings in ancient Chinese political philosophy: 'The people are the foundation of the state, and when the foundation is solid, the state is secure.' This means that when the people are sound, the independence and freedom of the nation are guaranteed. At the same time, the independence and freedom of the nation must be guaranteed for civil rights to be promoted and people's livelihood to be developed. Since the independence and freedom of the nation must be guaranteed by a sound people, then 'building the people' should precede 'building the nation.' How to 'build the people'? Today I propose a slogan, which is to 'venerate the law' and 'be pragmatic'." What is meant by "venerating the law" is to understand the law and abide by the law. What is meant by "being pragmatic" is to have sincerity, speak the truth, and do things practically. The spirit of "venerating the law and being pragmatic" is a kind of constructive spirit and the foundation of all undertakings. As far as the Northeast is concerned, we must have this spirit so that we can restore the Northeast from division and build it up from ruin. Zhang finally introduced Chief Lian's mission, saying that the Central Government valued the Northeast, so it appointed Chief Chen to concurrently serve as the Director of Northeast Administration. In less than a month since he took office, the methods he has started to implement are already clear, first rectifying military discipline, political ethics, and academic atmosphere. In essence, rectifying military discipline, political ethics, and academic atmosphere means rectifying public morals. Although the compatriots of Shenyang have long suffered, due to the influence of war and occupation, there are still many bad customs in society. The compatriots of Shenyang should take the lead in changing the atmosphere of this city in order to change the social atmosphere of the entire Northeast. I, as the head of the administration in the Central Government, adhere to the unchanging national policy of restoring and building the Northeast, and I will do my best to help achieve this goal.

[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 20th] Premier Zhang Qun went to visit the Fushun coal mine and power plant by special train on the morning of the 20th. He returned to Shenyang at 3:30 PM in the afternoon, accompanied by Guan Jiyu, Acting Chairman of the Northeast Economic Commission, Jin Zhen, the Mayor of Shenyang, Xie Shuying, Director of the Fushun Mining Bureau, and others. Zhang's special train departed from Shenyang North Station at 8:00 AM and arrived in Fushun at 9:05 AM. He successively visited the exhibition hall in the General Office of the Mining Bureau, the open-pit mine, the oil refinery, and the power plant of the Fushun Power Generation District Management Office of the Northeast Electric Power Bureau. He did not return to the Mining Bureau's guest house for lunch until 12:35 PM, where he inquired extensively. Premier Zhang expressed his deep appreciation to the staff of each factory for their hard work after the Soviet army's dismantling and the Communist bandits' destruction.

[Our Newspaper, Changchun, 20th] Zhang Qun will come to Changchun. The relevant authorities have prepared materials for consultation. Liang Huasheng came to Changchun on the 20th to prepare for welcoming Premier Zhang.

[Central News Agency, Shenyang, 20th] The newspapers today published a telegram from Secretary-General Wu Tiecheng to the elders and compatriots of the Northeast on "September 18th." The original text stated that in 1929, Tiecheng was ordered to comfort the troops and returned to Changchun from Jilin and Heilongjiang provinces. Observing the ambition of the strong neighbor to use military force to seize territory, he once called out the phrase "One does not know the greatness of China until one arrives in the Northeast, and one does not know the crisis of China until one arrives in the Northeast" to urge national compatriots to be vigilant. However, within two years, the Northeast fell. Now, two weeks after the victory, the golden goblet is still missing, and Northeast compatriots are still in dire straits. Recalling the past, I want to cry but have no tears. We should all strive together, not forget today, continue our efforts, and bring glory to our divine land.

### General Registration of Kuomintang Members; President Orders Drafting of Measures

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 20th] After the closing of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang, the first priority for improving party affairs is to conduct a general registration of party members. However, the start of the general registration will be after the unification of the party and the country's organization. President Chiang once instructed that the unification work should be completed within October, and the general registration may begin in November. Recently, President Chiang personally ordered the Central Standing Committee to appoint someone to draft the implementation measures for the general registration and to complete the draft within two weeks.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 20th] After the Kuomintang and the Three People's Principles Youth League unified their organizations, President Chiang especially emphasized the cultivation and training of cadres. It has now been decided to set up a Cadre Training Preparatory Committee in the Central Party Headquarters of the Kuomintang to be responsible for training cadres and handling the transfer of cadres within the party, actively enabling them to participate in the local administration of the recovered areas and to supervise the party and government work in the area, so as to achieve the task of building a healthy country after the war.

### Guangzhou Pacification Headquarters to be Abolished

[United Press, Nanjing, 20th] Qualified sources say: Song Ziwen's appointment as Chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Government shows the government's attention to the rampant smuggling and the budding separatist movement in the Guangzhou area. Furthermore, after Li Jishen was expelled from the Kuomintang, he incited opposition elements in Guangzhou from Hong Kong, but it is firmly believed that Song can stop the rebellion in time and will quickly promote the industrial and commercial revival of Guangzhou. The Director of the Guangzhou Pacification Headquarters should be a military officer as a matter of convention. Once Zhang Fakui is transferred to be the Chief Executive of Hainan, the Guangzhou Pacification Headquarters may be announced to be abolished, but before it is abolished, it is believed that Song, although a civil official, will temporarily concurrently serve as the Director of the Guangzhou Pacification Headquarters.

### Extension of the China-Canada Loan

According to this loan, which was negotiated with Canada during the Song Ziwen era, the total amount is 60 million Canadian dollars, which we used to purchase railway, shipbuilding equipment, and wheat flour from Canada. Two-thirds of it has already been used.

### Changchun Municipal Administrative Headquarters Order; Controls Grain, Soybeans, and Cotton Yarn; Sun Yueqi Summoned to Leave Beiping for Shenyang

[Our Newspaper, Changchun, 20th] Changchun Municipality has received emergency measures to control food, soybeans, and cotton yarn from the Administrative Headquarters. Regarding food, those who store more than fifty dan of sorghum must report to the local government for registration, otherwise, if found, it will be purchased at a negotiated price. Regarding soybeans, all formal and informal grain merchants must register within seven days. The soybeans of formal grain merchants will be purchased by the China Trust Bureau and the Military Grain Bureau at a negotiated price when necessary. The soybeans of informal grain merchants will be purchased by the above two agencies at the market price at the end of April. Violators will have their goods confiscated. Those who are found after inspection will receive 30% of the confiscated goods as a reward.

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 20th] Vice Chairman Sun Yueqi of the National Resources Commission, who had just arrived in Beiping, received a telegram from Premier Zhang Qun summoning him to Shenyang. Sun took a train at 6:30 AM on the 21st to go there. It is said that Sun will accompany Premier Zhang to inspect the various institutions under the National Resources Commission during his stay in Jinan. After completing his official duties, he may return to Beiping with Premier Zhang.

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 20th] Sun Yueqi, Vice Chairman of the National Resources Commission, arrived in Beiping by train from Tianjin yesterday. According to him: He inspected various factories and mines in the Northeast for more than a month. All factories are producing on the front line. The biggest difficulty is poor security. Under the repeated offensives of the Communist bandits, the various mines that have been ravaged, except for the Xi'an Coal Mine, which is still in the hands of the Communist bandits, have all resumed work, but a lot of equipment has been lost. The Anshan Iron and Steel Plant can still produce 6,000 to 7,000 tons per month. In addition, funding and talent are also the two major difficulties for industry and mining in the Northeast. The martyrdom of Zhang Huaifu, Yu Zailin, and others has made some excellent technical talents unwilling to work in the Northeast. Although the security in North China is slightly better than in the Northeast, the coordination of raw materials and factories is far inferior to that in the Northeast. Raw materials must be supplied from other places. For example, the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant is ready for everything, but the raw materials from the Longyan Iron Mine have not been transported here yet, and only a few thousand tons of coal have been stored. If it starts operating for a month, it will need 20,000 tons of coal.

In order to alleviate the current difficulties, starting from September of this year, the current salary income and living subsidies will be doubled. The case will be submitted to the general assembly of the Legislative Yuan on the 25th after being passed by the second joint meeting on the 23rd.

### First Batch of Chinese Business Representatives; Can Arrive in Japan Next Month

He predicted that trade between China and Japan will rank first in the foreign trade of the two countries, but due to the low purchasing power in various parts of China due to war damage, the goods that merchants purchase from Japan are mainly limited to those urgently needed by China's economy. Japanese goods will be divided into three categories: The purchase of machinery, building materials, transportation materials, and vehicle equipment will not be restricted. The purchase of textiles and manufactured goods must be approved by the delegation. The purchase of luxury goods must be obtained individual permits.

### Overseas Chinese Under the Fire of the Dutch and Indonesian Armies; A Special Correspondent's Account of the China National Aviation Corporation's Test Flight to Nanyang, No. 5 - Our Newspaper's Special Correspondent

— Wu Jiatang

In the escalating Dutch-Indonesian war, Batavia has become the focus of an international war of nerves, a diplomatic war, and a constant struggle. In the entire city of Batavia, it is difficult to find an objective person who is calm.

During my brief stay in the city, my main purpose was to find a more neutral person to talk about the causes and consequences of the Dutch-Indonesian dispute. However, the people I interviewed, whether they were overseas Chinese, American businessmen, British official representatives, or Australian journalists, all had different subjective opinions on the Dutch-Indonesian war. They were either extremely supportive of the Indonesian independence struggle or echoed the Dutch military actions. This trend of going to extremes also proves that under the current circumstances, there is no room for compromise between Dutch colonial policy and the Indonesian independence movement. The Dutch authorities and Indonesian leaders also frankly stated that in this struggle, they must go all out and win a "you die or I live" outcome. In this situation, the crisis of the lives and property of overseas Chinese can be imagined. When I and others landed in the city, local overseas Chinese reported to us the facts of Indonesian troops and people massacring overseas Chinese and burning their property. During the two days I stayed in the city, all we heard from the overseas Chinese were the inhumane atrocities committed by the Indonesians against the overseas Chinese.

These reports, which came from the mouths of overseas Chinese who were invited to Indonesia for abuse, of course have a considerable subjective component. However, when I asked Indonesian people for confirmation, they did not deny that their troops did kill Chinese and burn Chinese property. The Indonesian people explained these atrocities as follows: In the process of the war becoming heated, the residents of neutral countries will inevitably be ravaged by the war. They said: There is no intentional killing, robbery, or arson against the Chinese. However, the Indonesian spokesperson I interviewed made it clear that the special economic status of the overseas Chinese in Indonesia can no longer be allowed to continue to exist. From the perspective of the Indonesian people, the huge economic status of the overseas Chinese is the mainstay of Dutch imperialism. Therefore, in the strategy of overthrowing Dutch colonialism, the economic status that the overseas Chinese have established for three hundred years has become a major target of their operations.

The overseas Chinese have indeed encountered a tragic fate in this Dutch-Indonesian war. Many overseas Chinese have worked hard for seven or eight generations, frugally and diligently, and established a leading economic position. Now, they are watching all of this be swept away by the current war. Judging from the current situation, once the Indonesian people have a chance to come forward, the overseas Chinese will have no chance of survival within their sphere of influence.

As for the Dutch side, their explanation is the same as what I have heard from colonial authorities in various countries along the way. Their only goal is to maintain their colonial rights, and I have heard their argument against the independence movement, saying that the Indonesian people do not yet have the ability to govern themselves. This sentence may seem to have a considerable reason on the surface, but this must be attributed to the Dutch. The Dutch have ruled the Dutch East Indies for three hundred years, and more than 90% of the people are illiterate. Under this policy of "keeping the people ignorant," there is of course no talk of "self-government ability." My evaluation of the independence movement of the Indonesian Republic can be summed up in one sentence: it is still in an immature process. It lacks leadership talents, its internal organization is weak, and there is even less discipline in personnel. In order to achieve success quickly, it does not hesitate to act recklessly and runs to the road of extreme nationalism.

The Indonesian Republic's atrocities against the overseas Chinese are also enough to prove that it does not yet have thoughtful and capable leaders. The policy of anti-Chinese sentiment can be used to mobilize the emotions of the majority of Indonesians during the heated period of the independence movement, but from a long-term perspective, it is an unwise strategy.

The Indonesian people's independence movement this time is a business without capital. On the other hand, almost all of the financial power in the entire Dutch East Indies is controlled by the overseas Chinese. If the Indonesian leaders can win over the overseas Chinese who have economic power, then the independence movement will have an economic backing, and the promotion will be easier. However, the Indonesian leaders cannot see this point and reject the overseas Chinese with extreme narrow nationalism. The inability of the Indonesian independence movement to progress smoothly is also one of the main reasons.

The general overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies "feel that under the principle of national self-determination, the Indonesian independence movement is worth supporting. Before the war, the overseas Chinese also suffered enough from the bitterness of Dutch colonial policy, and they have no special liking for the Dutch government. However, since Indonesia has first declared war on the lives and property of overseas Chinese with a policy of anti-Chinese sentiment, the overseas Chinese have to take a hostile stance against Indonesia in order to protect the position they have earned with blood and sweat for more than 200 years.

The current Dutch-Indonesian war is basically a one-sided situation. Although the Dutch garrison has only more than 100,000 people, it is fully equipped with modern equipment and modern organization. The Indonesian side has few weapons and is a motley crowd. Militarily, there is no organization to speak of. They are more than capable of slaughtering unarmed overseas Chinese, but when dealing with the Dutch army, the general situation is to "retreat at the sound," and there is very little resistance. Although guerrilla warfare is Indonesia's only winning strategy, it is still in the stage of armchair strategy and it will still take time to launch it.

Under these difficult circumstances, the expectations of the overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies for the motherland are of course quite high. They hope that people in the country can recognize the current crisis, understand the anti-Chinese movement breaking out in Indonesia, and hope that people in the country will not only take into account theoretical gains and losses, but also provide concrete guarantees for the lives and property of overseas Chinese.

### Property Confiscated from Chinese Nationals Residing in Japan

Revised Application for Return Procedures

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 20th] According to diplomatic circles, regarding the application for the return of property confiscated from Allied nationals in Japan, the Far Eastern Commission previously stipulated that the original owner must be in Japan before the property can be returned. Our representative office in Japan believes that most of the Chinese nationals residing in Japan have returned to China, and it is extremely difficult to apply to go to Japan at present. Therefore, this provision is very inconvenient for Chinese nationals who have returned to China. After repeated consultations with the Allied Headquarters, a flexible solution has been obtained. According to this regulation, in the future, if Chinese nationals who have returned to China have their property in Japan confiscated by the Japanese government, they can entrust their relatives and friends in Japan or the Chinese Overseas Chinese Association and the Chinese Overseas Chinese Federation in various places to apply for return on their behalf. However, personnel of the United Nations government agencies stationed in Japan and their families are not allowed to serve as this agent.

[United Press, Washington, 19th] It was reported here today from Nanjing that the Commission had previously listed spindles on the list of non-reparations materials from Japan. The Chinese government intends to request that they be used as reparations. This request may be difficult to obtain the approval of most representatives of the Far Eastern Commission. According to those close to the conference, the policy of the Far Eastern Commission and MacArthur's headquarters is to maintain Japanese materials for the production of daily necessities, and spindles are one of the main items. It is doubtful whether the Far Eastern Commission and MacArthur's headquarters can approve China's request.

### Remaining Supplies on Okinawa

Improper Handling by the United States, Much Waste

[United Press, this city] According to sources in Washington on the 20th, after the Chinese government purchased the remaining supplies from the United States at a low price, it repeatedly sold many parts of this batch of equipment to American commercial firms and obtained extremely high profits. China purchased very heavy equipment, such as road construction machinery, for a price as low as 85 cents per pound. At least once, a 20-ton crane was sold by the Chinese government to an American commercial firm for US$18,000, which was half the price of a new crane in the United States. The most sold items included tractors. These vehicles are extremely difficult to purchase in the United States, and even require a wait of two years. The Chinese government purchased a batch of equipment at a price of 85 cents per ton, including a ship of tractors, a total of 112 vehicles, and resold them to an American commercial firm for a total price of more than US$700,000. Authorities said that the Chinese government's resale of remaining supplies to American commercial firms was not illegal. The place with the most accumulated remaining supplies is Okinawa Island. American representatives who visited the area were shocked by the handling methods. They said that many times, those who purchased the remaining goods specified which pile they wanted to buy, and the US Army personnel would use a road roller to compact the pile of equipment together. Once, the Army road roller piled ten trucks to the side, resulting in the destruction of all ten trucks. The Chinese remaining supplies on Okinawa Island are piled in a fence four miles long and three miles wide, which contains various types of machinery, which are made into a pile with the help of a road roller. Most of the equipment (including jeeps and ambulances) is now garbage, but most of it was brand new equipment, only slightly eroded by wind and rain.

### Rapid Progress of National Army in Jiaodong: Capturing Zhaoyuan and Advancing Swiftly Towards Qixia; Remnants of Chen Bandit's Forces in Western Shandong Flee Southward and Are Blocked

[Special Dispatch from Xuzhou, This Newspaper, 20th] The headquarters of the National Army in the Shandong Peninsula is advancing rapidly. The Laiyang National Army is advancing rapidly towards Lingshan. Furthermore, the National Army, which advanced in separate routes from Baxian towards Zhaoyuan, captured strongholds such as Gaoshan, Daoshun (south of Zhaoyuan), and Zhuqiao Town (west of Zhaoyuan) on the 19th. On the afternoon of the 20th, they attacked the city wall bordering Zhaoyuan.

[Special Dispatch from County, This Newspaper, 20th] The remnants of the Communist bandits in Jiaodong are fleeing in two routes: one route from Bianzhuang in Zhaoyuan towards Huangxian, and the other route from the east bank of the Xida River towards Qixia. To facilitate command, the Communist bandits, in addition to the original 9th Column, specially reorganized the new 5th, 6th, 7th, and 3rd Divisions into the 13th Column, fortifying each position step by step and resisting separately. Currently, approximately 50,000 wounded soldiers, family members, and new recruits of the Communist bandits have gathered near Wendeng.

[Special Dispatch from Qingdao, This Newspaper, 20th] The air force in the Shandong Peninsula has extensively bombed Juchi, Yashan, Louxia, Zhaoyuan, Yantai, and Longkou, inflicting heavy damage on the bandits. After clearing the remaining bandits in the four suburban areas of Laiyang, the National Army advanced to the banks of the Qingshui River and is engaged in a cross-river battle with the bandits. The bandit 9th and 13th Columns, as well as the Ying 5th Brigade, totaling over 100,000 troops, are currently gathered in the mountainous region ten *li* southwest of Zhaoyuan.

Around the 15th, the eight columns between Yuncheng and Heze at Wanglaohu and Hujiaji were attacked. Since the National Army recovered Yuncheng on the 16th and launched a pincer attack from the east and west with the Heze National Army, the bandits were unable to withstand it and continued to flee southward. Currently, only three columns remain near Wanglaohu, two columns are gathered at Ran Yinji west of Dingtao and Chengwu, and two newly organized columns are gathered south of Caoxian at Liangdi. The National Army is pursuing and suppressing them on one side and blocking them on the other at Dongtian Laojia.

### Recovery of Huoshan City in Central Anhui; Air Force Squadron Stationed in Wuhan Dispatched to Bomb; Communist Bandits in Southern Henan Counterattack Shangcheng Without Success

[Special Dispatch from Xuzhou, This Newspaper, 20th] The National Army pursuit brigade along the Liu (An) - Huo (Shan) Highway in central Anhui, after defeating a brigade of the bandit 3rd Column, totaling over 2,000 men, on the 19th, took advantage of the victory and advanced into Qingshanpu (14 kilometers north of Huoshan). On the 20th, they continued to advance, and in the afternoon, the National Army reached the outskirts of Huoshan City. A unit of the National Army Chang attacked and entered the city, completely recovering it by 6 PM. Furthermore, the National Army advancing southward from Shucheng recovered Zhongmei River (northwest of Tongcheng) on the 19th.

[Special Dispatch from Hefei, This Newspaper, 20th] Anhui Chairman Li Pinxian met with reporters today and discussed the war situation in Anhui Province. According to him, the Communist army of Liu Bocheng has fled to Anhui, but due to the rapid pursuit and suppression by the National Army, it has fallen into a state of confusion and helplessness. It is difficult to determine whether it intends to cross the Yangtze River, flee to northern Jiangsu, or hold the Dabie Mountains to the death. Its future path to survival depends entirely on exploiting any gaps. He has strictly ordered all counties near the Communist army to assist the National Army in strict defense and blockade, aiming to achieve the merit of annihilating them. Li will go to Shucheng on the 21st to inspect and give instructions on post-war matters.

[Special Dispatch from Hefei, This Newspaper, 20th] The Communist army in southern Henan, with six brigades, launched a counterattack on Shangcheng starting on the 17th. The National Army, with the determination to defend its territory, stood firm and is still engaged in fierce fighting in the suburbs today. After the recovery of Shucheng, 3,000 to 4,000 Communist troops fled in two routes, south and southwest. The southern route is still stagnant in the area of Buda Pass on the Liu (An) - He (Fei) Highway, while the southwestern route is entrenched in the Zhongmei River Xiaotian Town area under the jurisdiction of Shucheng County. The war has progressed into the mountains, and the National Army is advancing step by step. The Communist army has established a repair shop and sewing factory in the area south of Lihuang.

### The Legislative Yuan After the Implementation of Constitutionalism

— Chen Ruxuan

Legislative power itself inherently possesses a superiority that other governmental powers cannot match. Except for specific provisions or restrictions in the constitution, legislative power is the source of all governmental powers. Only after legislation can there be the need for the execution, interpretation, or supervision of laws, and the establishment of related institutions. Only after legislation can there be a basis for the distribution of powers, the assessment of personnel, the implementation of rewards and punishments, and the promulgation of all governmental decrees. From this perspective, it is not unreasonable to say that legislative power is above all else. Advanced democratic countries understand this, so they often set limits or impose checks and balances on the exercise of legislative power. For example, the President of the United States has the power to veto bills passed by Congress; even when Congress (referring to both the House and Senate) overrides the President's veto with a two-thirds majority, the President, if he firmly believes that the law is impractical, can still effectively prevent its promulgation, hence the so-called Pocket Veto, which is one example. Another example is the British Cabinet, originally selected by Parliament. However, if there is a conflict between the executive and legislative branches, while Parliament can vote to overthrow the Cabinet, the Cabinet can also, in the name of the head of state, dissolve Parliament and hold a general election to gauge public opinion, which is another example. A further example is the Swiss Parliament, which has complete supervisory and command authority over the executive branch (the Swiss executive adopts a committee system, and the members are elected by Parliament. Lord Bryce rightly pointed out that the Swiss Administrative Council is, in effect, a committee within Parliament, and this is a very accurate observation). However, the people have direct referendum and initiative rights to supervise Parliament. All laws passed by Parliament are in a "trial period" for three months after being promulgated by the government, and can only become fully effective after this period if no one requests a referendum. This is another example. In summary, modern countries, regardless of whether they adopt a cabinet system, a presidential system, or a committee system, generally require some form of check and balance on the legislative body, or retain a supervisory power that can be exercised directly by the people, in order to prevent the abuses of the representative system. This intention is far-reaching and should not be ignored.

According to the Constitution of our country, promulgated in January of this year, the Legislative Yuan is a directly elected body, and the Executive Yuan must be responsible to the Legislative Yuan. The Premier of the Executive Yuan is nominated by the President and appointed with the consent of the Legislative Yuan (Articles 55 and 57 of the Constitution), which seems to resemble a responsible cabinet system. However, when the Executive Yuan refuses to execute a resolution or bill of the Legislative Yuan, "the President may request the Legislative Yuan for reconsideration," a provision that resembles a presidential system. However, "if the original bill is upheld by a two-thirds majority of the members present during reconsideration, the Premier of the Executive Yuan shall either accept it or resign," which is inconsistent with both the presidential and cabinet systems. Under a cabinet system, there is no need for reconsideration at all. Under a presidential system, the executive head is not required to resign under these circumstances. Now the Legislative Yuan has the power to reorganize the Executive Yuan, but the executive branch has no power to dissolve the Legislative Yuan. This kind of one-sided political power is rare in modern countries governed by the rule of law. Assuming that these constitutional provisions are not amended, we can often imagine the power of the Legislative Yuan in the future.

Furthermore, regarding the power of consent, the US Senate also has this power. However, the US Constitution takes the principle of the separation of powers as its guiding principle. The executive, legislative, and judicial branches each have their own scope and cannot overstep each other. All executive departments are responsible to the President. Therefore, the Senate mostly approves the President's nominations for cabinet members as a matter of routine, and rarely makes things difficult. In fact, the President has absolute freedom in choosing cabinet members. However, the situation in our country's Legislative Yuan cannot be entirely the same. The fact that the Executive Yuan should be responsible to the Legislative Yuan has already been expressly stipulated in the Constitution, so the Legislative Yuan naturally has the right to judge whether the Premier of the Executive Yuan can "take responsibility" and must give it much consideration. Whether the President is truly relying on that person is reduced to a question of little importance. If so, the Legislative Yuan can reject one person nominated by the President in the morning; it can reject another person nominated by the President in the evening. As a result, unless the President first seeks the consent of a majority of legislators, or even has the Legislative Yuan publicly recommend a person and ask the President to make a formal nomination, the Premier of the Executive Yuan will not be easily produced. Therefore, the power to appoint the Premier of the Executive Yuan effectively lies with the Legislative Yuan. Faced with a mediocre president, it will inevitably be impossible to exercise his right of choice, and he can only follow the lead of the Legislative Yuan.

Moreover, according to the Organic Law of the Legislative Yuan promulgated in March of this year, the Legislative Yuan has stipulated that one-third of the total number of members constitutes a quorum, and the consent of a majority of the members present (i.e., a little more than one-sixth of all members) can pass laws, budgets, declarations of war, peace negotiations, treaties, amnesties, and martial law proposals; can resolve to "request the Executive Yuan to change important policies"; and can exercise the power to consent to the candidates for Premier of the Executive Yuan; the consent of two-thirds of the members present (i.e., slightly less than one-quarter of all members) can force the Executive Yuan to implement any law and resolution at any time, or cause the Premier of the Executive Yuan to resign and completely reorganize the Executive Yuan. Under these circumstances, we must especially prevent the abuse of power by a minority and maintain the spirit of democratic legislation. The organization of political parties in our country today is not yet sound, and party members also lack political cultivation. Whether in or out of power, they have failed to fully demonstrate the demeanor of statesmen in the past, and there are often disagreements within parties. How easy is it to achieve the grand effect of Anglo-American party politics in the Legislative Yuan of the future? I am truly afraid that the selection of personnel will be haphazard, the spirit will be scattered, the cunning will take advantage of the opportunity, and the powerful will tend towards it, resulting in turmoil and political instability. This is something that we should pay close attention to and think about how to prevent. In short, the Legislative Yuan after the implementation of constitutionalism is neither subject to the supervision of the National Assembly (according to the constitutional provisions, the National Assembly cannot exercise the powers of recall, election, referendum, and initiative over the Legislative Yuan), nor can it be dissolved by the President, nor can it be checked and balanced by the executive branch, nor can it be directed by the people's direct legislative power (such as referendum and initiative). Its members can only be recalled separately by each electoral district. Unless a matter of great importance to the interests of a district occurs, the voters of that district will definitely not bother to recall their own elected legislators. Therefore, the Legislative Yuan has almost become an indissoluble parliament, and legislators will also become members who are extremely difficult to recall. Only when the term of three years is up for re-election can the people count their merits and demerits and determine their stay or departure. Holding an immovable position and exercising the highest undisputed power is truly rare in democratic legislative countries. If the legislators elected are incompetent, the danger is very great. Therefore, the issue of the selection of legislators today is the key to the success or failure of the entire constitutionalism in the future. If we can get more people who are loyal and devoted to the country, talented, knowledgeable, and possessing the demeanor of statesmen, then even if their opinions differ, their goals can still be consistent, so that, invisibly, the 700 members all share the public belief that "the nation comes first." From this belief will generate the greatest and most righteous power, to assist the executive power left and right, complementing each other. At the same time, all political parties must also reorganize their internal organizations, concentrate the will of their members, refresh their political propositions, and strive to engage in the political training of their members, cultivating the most excellent to prepare for winning the people's representatives, so that the Legislative Yuan will not only be the highest power organ, but also the general organ for the nation's first-class talents, then the future of constitutionalism will be infinitely bright.

### Deepening Divide Between East and West Groups: France Decides to Strictly Adhere to Neutrality, Bidault Opposes Amending Veto Power

[Report from this Newspaper] San Francisco, 20th Dispatch: French Foreign Minister Bidault, in his speech at the United Nations General Assembly today, expressed his opposition to the US proposal to amend the veto power, stating that France would reject any proposal to abandon the veto power. At the same time, Bidault dismissed Soviet accusations that the Marshall Plan was a scheme to divide Europe as mere rhetoric. Bidault stated that France would maintain neutrality in the diplomatic battle between the Western and Eastern blocs. He emphasized France's support for the Marshall Plan and earnestly requested that the Soviet Union reconsider its refusal to participate.

Bidault stated that Europe must unite, or it would perish. Regarding the achievements of the Security Council, Bidault expressed disappointment and pointed out that this was due to the misuse of the veto power. Bidault concluded by calling on all countries to reach an early agreement on Germany. [Report from this Newspaper] San Francisco, 20th Dispatch: French Foreign Minister Bidault stated in his address to the United Nations General Assembly today: "The conflict between the United States and the Soviet Union is becoming increasingly acute, and the situation is extremely dangerous, making it seem hopeless to reconcile the views of the two sides. The relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union has become impossible to resolve as a result of the harsh speeches delivered by Marshall and Vyshinsky. I believe it would be even more dangerous to attempt to conceal the seriousness of the crisis at this time."

In his pessimistic and frank speech, Bidault stated, "Since the founding of the United Nations, France has made every effort to bring the two countries together, but to no avail. Frankly speaking, the conflict of opinions between the two countries cannot be reconciled. Therefore, France has no choice but to adopt a firm stance." Bidault then detailed France's position on each issue, standing with the United States on almost every issue.

[Report from this Newspaper] New York, 20th Dispatch: Czech Foreign Minister Masaryk stated in his speech to the General Assembly today that European countries are clearly moving towards the left, as a warning to capitalist America. Czechoslovakia opposes any direct or indirect amendment to the United Nations Charter, believing that any amendment would be enough to shake the foundation of the United Nations. It seems that if the world is forced to split into two major blocs, the differences between the major powers will deepen and bring the world closer to the brink of war.

### Proposal to Amend Veto Power Still on UN General Assembly Agenda: Soviet Union and Poland Vote Against, China, France, and India Abstain

[United Press, New York, 19th Dispatch] The General Assembly's fourteen-nation steering committee today voted nine to two to include on the General Assembly's agenda a proposal by Argentine representative Arce to have the General Assembly's special meeting discuss the veto power issue. The Soviet Union and Poland both voted against it, while China, France, and India abstained. Previously, Chinese representative Chiang Ting-fu declared that the time was not yet ripe to amend the veto power. However, Chiang Ting-fu claimed, "Examining the possibility of changing the veto power" could be promoted. Soviet representative Gromyko strongly opposed the proposal, accusing the two-year movement to abolish the veto power as being "hostile" to the Soviet Union, with "certain powerful groups and countries" masterminding it behind the scenes. The steering committee has received a total of sixty-two proposals and is now striving to review them one by one so that they can be included on the General Assembly's agenda.

### United Nations General Assembly: Third Day of Debate

[Reuters, Flushing Meadow, 19th Dispatch] In the United Nations General Assembly today, renewed calls for criticism of the veto power were heard. Argentine representative Arce led the offensive, proposing two new systems to avoid the drawbacks of the veto power: Resolutions of the Security Council, passed by a two-thirds majority, cannot be subject to the veto power. The five major powers have the right to oppose resolutions passed by a two-thirds majority, and this opposition is referred to the General Assembly's permanent committee for reconsideration, with a two-thirds majority deciding whether the opposition is upheld or rejected.

The next speaker was Indian representative Mrs. Pandit, who did not directly mention the Soviet Union or the establishment of the fifty-five-nation Peace and Security Committee of Marshall, and seemed to want to take an independent stance between these two major opposing views. She criticized the unrestricted use of the veto power and called for less use of the veto power, but also said, "We believe that the current priority is not to amend the Charter or divert our efforts to engage in inappropriate revisions, but to have all members faithfully fulfill the principles and letter of the Charter."

South African representative Lawrence pointed out that today's world has become a world of disappointment, and people are gradually losing confidence in the United Nations organization. Lawrence continued, "The people of South Africa do not have extreme suspicions about the Soviet Union, and we regard some of the lands acquired by the Soviet Union after the war as insignificant, but I personally know that these lands are not non-self-governing lands, and we must not interfere in our internal affairs."

Greek representative Dendramis mentioned British aid to Greece, saying that it was at the request of the Greek government and aimed at maintaining the political independence and sovereign integrity of a member state, and was by no means an illegal interference in Greece's internal affairs.

Belarusian representative Kiselyov spoke for as long as fifty minutes, mostly reiterating what Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky had already stated yesterday. When referring to "the United States undermining the work of the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission," he made a warning statement, saying, "Let us not forget that if one side uses atomic bombs, the other side will always retaliate with atomic bombs or something even worse than atomic bombs." The General Assembly then adjourned and will reconvene on Saturday afternoon.

### Dollar Panic Not Yet Reduced: British Financial Crisis Severe, Chancellor States May Continue to Use Gold Reserves

[Reuters, London, 19th Dispatch] Chancellor Dalton stated at a press conference on the 19th that Britain may have to continue to use its gold reserves to meet dollar needs. This should be seen as a dangerous signal, and people should be aware of it.

Dalton also said that Britain may have to purchase more dollars from the International Monetary Fund again. As for applying for loans from the International Bank, it has not yet been considered, but this is not impossible. It is estimated that Britain's gold reserves are worth about 600 million pounds, and recently gold worth 20 million pounds has been sold to the United States, and another 60 million US dollars have been exchanged from the International Monetary Fund. Dalton said: Britain is the first country to exchange dollars from the International Monetary Fund, which shows that the board of directors of the IMF believes that Britain's financial imbalance is a temporary phenomenon, because the purpose of the organization is only to assist in temporary international payment imbalances. Dalton also said that it is not yet known whether he will present an autumn budget. Dalton added that Britain will contact the countries in the Sterling Area to jointly take steps to reduce the dollar threat.

### Fubo Tragedy Trial Concluded and Awaiting Judgment: Seamen from the Hai Min Arrive to Testify That Passengers' Testimony is Wrong; Lawyers Argue That Maritime Law Should Apply

[Report from this Newspaper] The long-delayed Fubo ship sinking tragedy case was concluded in the First Criminal Court yesterday morning at 10:00 a.m. with Presiding Judge Zhu Nianci, associate judges Zhong Xianda and Xie Zhiying, and Prosecutor Cao Hongsheng presiding. In addition to Hai Guan ship captain Zai Rulin, who was accused, helmsman Qu Fuqing, seaman Ma Fugen, and chief mate Wu Nianzu of the Hai Wen were also present. The other ten witnesses, including Xu Zucen, did not attend. First, Prosecutor Cao announced the main points of the indictment, accusing the defendant of the crime of manslaughter. Subsequently, Dai Beilin was questioned, claiming that the collision between the two ships occurred at 0:15 a.m. on March 19. The Hai Guan ship was sailing from Xiamen to Shanghai. The main cause of the collision was that the Fubo ship did not follow the navigation regulations. When I discovered the danger ahead, I immediately ordered the engine to be reversed, but it was too late. After the collision, I continued to reverse the engine and ordered the chief mate to inspect the ship for damage. I found that the bow was damaged and ordered someone to measure the water level at that location. I used a searchlight to look for the ship involved in the collision at sea and used wireless communication, but there were no results. At that time, I did not know that the Fubo ship had sunk, nor did I hear anyone calling for help. I searched the accident site for ten hours after the collision, and only rescued Jiao Dexiao. At that time, I was busy directing the crew and ordered the chief mate to order all the sailors to prepare life-saving equipment. I did not pay attention to the actions of the passengers. According to Qu Fuqing, he was steering on the bridge at around 12:00 a.m. and saw the Fubo ship with lights coming head-on. After the collision, I immediately called the chief mate to first inspect the ship. I sometimes ran the engine slowly, sometimes stopped the engine, and shone a searchlight on the sea, but there was still no movement. Ma Fugen testified that his job was to observe the movement of the sea on the deck. When the incident occurred, I was just on duty when I was surprised to see a ship coming from the other side. I rang the alarm bell twice, but the ship had already collided when I rang the bell, and I was knocked down on the deck. After that, the chief mate immediately inspected the entire ship and ordered us all to prepare for rescue work. The passenger's testimony that the ship moved forward after the accident is wrong. Because passengers have no nautical knowledge or experience, how can they distinguish the direction of the ship in the middle of the night? Wu Nianzu testified that after the accident, I immediately ordered all personnel to inspect and prepare for rescue work. Based on my nautical experience, I judged that the ship's direction of movement was about one nautical mile away from the accident site. If the ship had been moving forward, I would not believe that Jiao Dexiao's swimming speed could be compared to the ship. At this point, Prosecutor Cao stood up and argued that the defendant should be punished for negligent homicide. The defendant's defense lawyer, Wei Wenda, argued that maritime law should apply to the case, not ordinary criminal law, and cited the "circumstances of the killing," etc. (Sentence to be determined on the 26th. The request for bail was approved and a statement will be made pending a decision.)

### This Newspaper Holds a Grand Celebration: More Than 2,000 Guests from All Walks of Life Attend; Film Shown After the Meeting, All Employees Gather for Dinner

"Report from this Newspaper" This newspaper's grand celebration commemorating the 75th anniversary of its founding and the publication of its 25,000th issue was held at the Grand Cathay Theater yesterday morning. The presidium consisted of Du Yuesheng, Chen Jinglian, Pan Gongzhan, Shi Yonggeng, Qian Xinzhi, Cheng Cangbo, Xu Tuhao, and Chen Xunyue. Guests included Chen Qicai, Hong Lanyou, Wu Guozhen, Qian Dajun, He Yaozu, Fang Zhi, Wu Shaoshu, Yu Shuping, Zhang Xiaosong, Tian Bingqian, Zhao Zukang, Zhao Zengjue, Zhang Wei, Li Ximou, Wang Xiaolai, Xu Bangguang, Ma Xingye, Guo Yunguan, Du Baoqi, and guests from party, government, education, culture, business, and foreign countries, totaling about 2,000 people. The meeting began at 9:30 a.m. to the sounds of military music. Chairman Du and President Pan delivered speeches in succession, Mayor Wu delivered a congratulatory speech, and finally, General Manager Chen thanked the guests. The atmosphere was warm and exciting, and the ceremony was completed at 10:30 a.m.

### Chairman's Speech: Three Thoughts

Chairman Du stated in his opening speech: Today is the 75th anniversary of the founding of this newspaper and the commemoration of the publication of its 25,000th issue. Seventy-five years is certainly small and insignificant in the endless past and present, but in terms of the common situation of human life being at most a hundred years, it is not a short time. Moreover, in these seventy-five years, the changes in the world and the complexity of human affairs have been indescribable. Newspapers are responsible for reporting, from which one can imagine the exhaustion of Shen Bao during this period. Today, in commemorating the 75th anniversary of this newspaper, I have three thoughts: First, Shen Bao is the earliest newspaper in our country. Seventy-four years ago, it not only did pioneering work for the news industry in our country, but also played an enlightening role in the entire cultural innovation movement. To this day, Shen Bao's modest achievements are no accident. Second, Shen Bao is well-known throughout the country because of its long history and age. Its circulation is wide and far-reaching. We can now boldly say that today's leaders in China, from the heads of government to the leaders of all levels of society, can be said to have all had a written relationship (reading or writing) with Shen Bao. In other words, they are all readers of Shen Bao. Therefore, it has greatly increased Shen Bao's nourishment and promoted Shen Bao's progress. Third, in view of the importance of the mission of the times and the arduousness of the industry, we really feel that it is necessary to work ten times or a hundred times harder than in the past. However, my colleagues are ashamed of their shallowness and still hope that leaders from all walks of life and colleagues will give us more guidance.

### President's Hope to Carry on the Past and Open up the Future, Worthy of the Country and Society's Cultivation

President Pan summarized the evolution of the domestic and international situation over the past seventy-five years, highlighting the paper's efforts to establish itself over a long period. He stated: "The news industry is inextricably linked to the fate of the nation and its people, the rise and fall of politics and economy, the waxing and waning of culture and education, the changes in social customs, and the flourishing and decline of human civilization. This is especially evident in newspapers like ours, with a long history, wide circulation, and a national readership." The Shen Bao over the past seventy-five years is a lengthy chronicle of modern history. The rapid changes and numerous events of the past seventy-five years are unprecedented. Therefore, the birth and growth of the Shen Bao has shouldered the heavy burden of the times from the beginning, allowing no complacency. The Shen Bao's struggles and achievements over the past seventy-five years have their objective and truthful evaluation. Two facts cannot be ignored: First, the unwavering love and support of a vast readership has prompted the newspaper to cherish itself and make progress. Second, the lifelong diligence and efforts of the newspaper's many veteran colleagues have nurtured the newspaper's growth and prosperity. On this commemorative occasion, we should express our deepest gratitude here. At present, the world is still turbulent and restless, the domestic banditry has not yet been quelled, and the fate of mankind is facing a serious threat. The responsibility of newspapers is undoubtedly increasing day by day. For the sake of world civilization, for the sake of human happiness, for the sake of national survival, for the sake of national rejuvenation, we, our colleagues, should raise our awareness and supervise each other when we hold the Shen Bao's 75th anniversary celebration today. Today, while commemorating the hard work of our past colleagues, we must also encourage our current colleagues to carry on the past and open up the future, creating a brighter and more splendid future for us, so as to be worthy of the country and society's cultivation over the past seventy-five years."

Mayor's Address

Guest Mayor Wu said in his speech: "One thing in Shanghai that impressed me deeply was seeing the Shen Bao from issue number one to the present in the Xujiahui Catholic Library. Historically speaking, it is China's first news source. The Shen Bao represents Shanghai. Whether it is the government or the citizens, they have a special interest in the Shen Bao. I hope that the Shen Bao can always speak for the citizens of Shanghai and represent China. I respectfully wish the Shen Bao eternal progress and longevity." After the music was played and the ceremony was completed, colorful cartoons and the film "Lilac Mountain" were shown to entertain the guests. The meeting adjourned around twelve o'clock. At seven o'clock in the evening, all the colleagues of this newspaper held a dinner party at the Dahongyun Restaurant. The scene of exchanging toasts was grand and unprecedented, and it did not end until late at night.

### Anecdotes from the Anniversary Celebration

"It is rare to live to seventy years old," and it is even rarer for a newspaper to have a long lifespan. Therefore, yesterday's celebration of the 75th anniversary of this newspaper was particularly lively. Inside and outside the building, there was an atmosphere of "congratulations" and joy.

From today, the main entrances of this newspaper on Shandong Road and Hankou Road are decorated with pine and cypress archways and lanterns and colored ribbons. Passersby who pass by this building cannot help but look up and pay attention.

Various sectors sent congratulatory gifts. This newspaper declared in advance that it welcomed cash donations to scholarship funds. Therefore, there were only a few flower baskets among the gifts, which was in line with the principle of frugality. Mayor Wu and Commander Xuan each sent a vertical scroll. Mr. Feng Chaoran sent a famous painting, which was originally intended to be auctioned on the spot to raise money for scholarships, but it was not realized due to lack of time.

Mayor's Punctuality

Heads of various sectors came to congratulate the celebration. Mayor Wu's virtue of punctuality remained unchanged, and he arrived at 8:40.

Chairman Du arrived early to preside over the ceremony, with a joyful spirit and a amiable smile. The celebration ceremony can be said to have truly achieved simplicity and solemnity. Due to time constraints, Mayor Wu represented all the guests in his speech, which avoided unnecessary length.

The attendees of the celebration were very numerous, and the downstairs location of the spacious Da Guangming Cinema was almost "full." Among the guests were two foreigners, and many readers of this newspaper came from afar to participate, which was admirable.

Distribution of Newspapers to Guests

Each guest was given a copy of this newspaper, a copy of the literary journal "Bungei Shunju", a stack of commemorative stationery, and an 80% discount coupon for a map, as well as custom-made celebratory cigarettes.

The dinner scene was unprecedentedly grand. There was no empty seat in the Da Hongyun Restaurant. The general manager, Jin Heming, responded with sweat, repeatedly saying: "It is rare to encounter such a grand celebration of the 75th anniversary in one's life, and I should help more!"

All the employees of this newspaper, including those working abroad, number nearly a thousand. They rarely have the opportunity to meet together at ordinary times. Last night, they gathered together, talking and laughing, as close as family members.

A Melody of "Flowing Stream"

The Chinese Orchestra led by Professor Wei from the Academy of Arts was specially invited to perform a melody of "Flowing Stream" last night, which was rewarded with extremely enthusiastic applause in the hall. Professor Wei's solo pipa performance of "Ambush from All Sides" was powerful and resonant, matching the exciting and joyful mood of the entire venue, making people feel refreshed and completely dispelling any drunkenness.

### General Chen Cheng in the Northeast (Our newspaper's Shenyang dispatch dated the 15th)

General Chen Cheng, in his capacity as Chief of Staff concurrently Director of the Northeast Headquarters, has been in charge of the Northeast for half a month. What has he been doing during this half-month? Everyone is watching with wide eyes, looking and hoping that he will show some real results.

At a tea party for people's representatives, Ma Yuchen, the old man—who calls himself an "old youth"—the speaker of the Liaoning Provincial Assembly, said decisively: "Xiong Shihui is an internist. We invite Director Chen, who also serves as director, to be a surgeon, to operate on the Northeast's malignant tumors. Everyone can sign their names as relatives to trust him."

What are the Northeast's malignant tumors? They are the evil forces that arose in the military and political spheres after the recovery, corruption, hijacking, illegal activities... Leaving the common people with a narrow path, causing a very bad reaction—especially during the Communist Party's fifth offensive, when Panyang was shaken. Many resourceful people, leaving orderlies to watch over their houses, hijacked their belongings and families, and rushed south, causing great resentment, even drawing a line between "Southerners" and "Northeasterners." Director Chen, who also serves as director, said: "The Northeastern compatriots have reacted very badly to all the measures after the recovery. There are certainly many reasons... Our soldiers need to take over national territory."

"Today, the territory has not been fully recovered, and yet they are taking over materials. That is certainly wrong!"

"Now I have decided to start with the Headquarters, and first limit it to those above the section chief level. If anyone illegally occupies people's houses, the people can report them. If they use the excuse that their families have no place to live, then send their families back inside the Pass. If they occupy people's land, return it to them quickly. If section chiefs or above in the Headquarters are running factories, if they are heavy industries, they should be handed over to the National Resources Commission; light industries should be run by the people. Other agencies should gradually do the same. Everyone should be able to correct their mistakes."

"I hate corruption the most. I have not been corrupt in the past, and I don't think I will be corrupt in the future. I am already a fifty-year-old widow, and I believe I will not lose my virtue again."

"The wind of corruption cannot be allowed to grow, and rumors of corruption cannot be believed. The Communist Party is trying to divide us by saying, 'China is a corrupt country, the government is a corrupt government.' If you say that, then there are no good people... If anyone is corrupt, I will never condone it. I will fundamentally cure it by building a good environment. Those who need to be operated on will be operated on, and I hope everyone will examine themselves first."

The cumbersome and delayed procedures of government offices, causing delays and mistakes, also give staff members the time and opportunity to cheat. Director Chen, who also serves as director, is paying close attention to this matter and has called for simplified procedures. The first thing he wants to do is start with the Headquarters itself.

He is paying special attention to the disbursement procedures. Someone said: "In the past, getting money was harder than climbing to heaven. The greed of those who disbursed the money made people feel numb."

In Malu Bay, Heping District, Panyang, there is a row of tall red buildings. The neon lights of the "Military Science Research Association Guesthouse" are flashing. In the basement of the building, jazz music is playing. There is food, dancing, and accommodation, adding a lot of "excitement" to this important place for transportation.

This is the "Taidong Building," built by a Mr. Sun and a Japanese person during the puppet Manchukuo regime. After the recovery, the Northeast Real Estate Administration should have been able to take over at least half of the property rights. However, a big problem arose here, causing a big dispute.

General Tian Xiangfan, the host of the Panyang "Military Science Research Association" and the "China Military Science Monthly" published in Nanjing, lives in the Taidong Building. It is said that Mr. Sun asked him to support everything. Later, it seems that there was a falling out between Tian and Sun.

Someone reported the lieutenant general to Director Xiong Shihui. It is said that Xiong ordered the General Affairs Office to investigate, but there was no follow-up.

Director Chen, who also serves as director, has arrived.

At a tea party inviting people from all walks of life, Director Chen, who also serves as director, said: "A lieutenant general was running a dance hall. Hearing that I was coming, he hid."

Less than three days later, the newspapers in Panyang published a piece of news: "Tian Xiangfan, a lieutenant general in active service, is arrested and interrogated for running a business and seeking profit in the name of the Military Science Research Association, and for running a dance hall."

The same day's newspaper also published: "Major General Li Yaozi, commander of the Benxihu District Security Command, has been sentenced to imprisonment for abandoning Benxi," "Li Xiusang, the former major general director of the Japanese Prisoner of War Administration, was accused of extorting Japanese prisoners of war at the Tokyo Headquarters, and the authorities have detained him for investigation," and "Liu Jiehui was arrested and deported for enlisting troops and engaging in speculative trading under the name of a major general." Everyone is saying:

General Chen has started the operation!

The jeeps and trucks speeding down the streets with girls have decreased compared to before. The owners who left orderlies to watch over their empty houses are thinking about how to resell them. They are all wary.

The heads of administrative agencies and other departments have repeatedly warned their employees to be careful and diligent, otherwise it will not be fun. The words "alertness" and "vigilance" have been firmly imprinted on the minds and bodies of all civil servants, especially those in charge of each unit.

The people of the Northeast are suffering. Director Chen, who also serves as director, said: "The prices in Panyang are higher than in Beijing and Shanghai. The people are suffering extremely. The first step I will take is to clarify the situation, such as what are the necessary and surplus material conditions in the Northeast, so as to seek remedial work." To this end, he has already convened major personnel from the economic, transportation, and Northeast Materials Adjustment Committee to conduct a careful study.

Director Chen, who also serves as director, believes that military force should only be allowed to be held by the state. Irregular local forces must be abolished to avoid disturbing the people and increasing their suffering.

In order to harvest the autumn crops and adjust the conscription issue, Director Chen, who also serves as director, has decided to suspend conscription for two months starting in September.

At the same time, he said: "It is impossible to maintain the Northeast with the strength of the Northeast alone. Moreover, the Northeast problem is a national problem. Therefore, the whole country must bear the burden of military resources." This is correct. Now we have seen a steady stream of new troops coming to the Northeast from inside the Pass, and the news that the Fifth Army Corps is about to be formed has also become a welcome fact.

Relieving the suffering of the people of the Northeast is being gradually improved. The next question is how to launch military operations. Director Chen, who also serves as director, said: "Everyone has too much hope for me, but my cultivation is not enough. I hope you will give me a period of time and guidance."

Director Chen's ultimate goal in governing the Northeast: "To normalize the Northeast and build a truly democratic experimental zone where people can live and work in peace!" (Special Correspondent Han Qingtao)

### The Murderer in the Zhen'an Blood Case, Sun Junbo, Sentenced to Death; Court Disallows His Request for Bail for Medical Treatment

[Our newspaper's Xi'an dispatch dated the 15th] Sun Junbo, the former magistrate of Zhen'an County, southern Shaanxi, who shocked the country for rape and murder, was sentenced by the Chang'an District Court last month to death for the murder (including the speaker and secretary-general of Zhen'an County Council, a total of four lives). He was also sentenced to twelve years in prison for luring and raping a female teacher, leading to her suicide by poison. Sun expressed his dissatisfaction and appealed to the Shaanxi Provincial High Court. After two court hearings, the verdict was announced this afternoon, upholding the original sentence and sentencing Sun to death. Only the rape part was reduced to three years, because the father of the female teacher, Wang Lianmin, could not provide sufficient evidence to prove that his daughter and Sun cohabited under duress. Sun, however, provided letters between Wang and him before her death, with some points sufficient to prove that their union was "mutually voluntary," and her parents had also expressed that they would not oppose their marriage under certain conditions.

At the time of the sentencing, Sun strode into the court with his head held high (because he was not wearing shackles), carrying a large briefcase, with his charisma undiminished. At the moment of hearing the verdict, he seemed to receive a heavy blow, but he tried his best to remain calm. Regarding the judge's verdict, he repeatedly said, "I can't hear clearly," "I don't know." When the judge repeated that he was still sentenced to death, Sun stubbornly replied, "I am innocent. If you sentence me to death today, please execute me by shooting me in court immediately!" Later, he used foot problems as an excuse and asked to be released on bail for medical treatment and surgery, but the judge did not grant his request. Sun's two guards both upheld the original sentence of death from the first instance. The appeals of other criminals, such as Ma Zhuoran, an inspector of the provincial government, and Fan Weishi, the former director of the Zhen'an Youth Preparatory Committee, were also rejected.

It is reported that they are preparing to make a final appeal to the Nanjing High Court within ten days. (Reporter Mai Ye)

### Deputy Director of Wuhan Headquarters Urges Strengthening Party Purification and Renovation

[Our newspaper's Chengdu dispatch dated the 17th] Wang Xuqiu, member of the Central Committee and Deputy Director of the Wuhan Headquarters (the left picture is of Mr. Wang), will have been in Rong for almost two months after returning to Rong from Yu. A reporter came to Rong from Yu to visit him today. He was told: "Currently, the corruption of officials, the incompetence of the quota, and the economic crisis in China cannot be denied.

### Qingdao China Textile Company Repairs Boilers; Workers and Engineers Have Technical Disputes; Not a Common Labor Strike; Worthy of Learning for the Industrial Community

[Our newspaper's Qingdao dispatch dated the 15th] Recently, a technical dispute arose between a technical worker and an engineer at the China Textile Company here over the repair of boilers. The factory accused the workers of interfering with technical administration, and that the workers should not intervene excessively; the workers believed that the engineer's skills were poor, and pointed out that such practices "will inevitably lead to the deterioration of machine parts, and the complete shutdown of work is to be expected." The factory firmly believed that there were no errors, but on the other hand, it replaced another engineer to preside over the matter. The engineer immediately overturned the previous repair plan and replaced it with a new repair plan. Therefore, it further proves that the previous engineer's handling was inappropriate. The dispute has now passed. The process of this matter is very instructive for the industrial community. According to the Cang Kou District Industrial Union:

"The No. 6 China Textile Factory has a total of ten boilers, No. 2 to No. 7 are 10-ton small boilers, No. 8 is a 30-ton large boiler, and No. 9 and No. 10 are 8-ton small boilers. Among them, No. 7 has a public furnace bottom. The remaining nine were repaired and used after the Japanese occupied Qingdao, until now. The small ones have been used for 20 years, but there has been no damage. The large 30-ton one is especially strong and has only been used for more than two years (used for a year and a half by the Japanese Iron and Steel Plant, and then received and used for seven or eight months). Although it has been through a burned-out area, only a few steam pipes are slightly curved, which is a common phenomenon, and a little finishing will not hinder its use. Who knew that the engineer Ge Zupeng mistakenly thought that it could not be repaired, and on June 8, he ordered that this large boiler be removed in this way so that all new pipes could be replaced. As a result, this large boiler was abandoned and could not be used.

"It is found that this large boiler was purchased from the United Kingdom in the 26th year of the Republic of China. The steam pipe is 22 feet long and 4 inches in diameter, and can generate 400 pounds of steam. Although there are two small holes leaking steam, it is only necessary to replace the adjacent pipes that are squeezed, and it can be used as usual. Engineer Ge refused the experienced suggestions of skilled workers and insisted on his own way. This boiler is jointly used by the six, eight, and nine textile factories. Such a tragic destruction has been shelved for three months, and there is no installation method. The facts are all there. Is it appropriate? Please invite the industrial authorities to investigate and the industrial community to comment. "In the past, for the No. 9 and No. 10, 8-ton boilers, Engineer Ge disliked that they were fixed furnace bottoms and wanted to exchange the movable furnace bottom of No. 7 to No. 9. However, the sizes of the No. 7 and No. 9 boilers were different, and the left and right sides of the locomotive were not clear. The wrong parts were installed, and only after the fact did he know that 336 steam pipes were all cut off due to the error. Then he dismantled the No. 10, and even moved out a furnace bottom in storage, and added a plan. As a result, the No. 9 and No. 10 boilers were dismantled, and the furnace bottom in storage is still happily in the iron and steel square, at the mercy of the wind and rain. All are stages of destruction, and afterwards, they are all at a loss and cannot be just.

"Now that the large boiler is broken and cannot be used, we still rely on small boilers to supply power. However, the steam power is insufficient, and we have to rely on wind power to promote the fire. Therefore, every day we consume more than 30 tons of coal, and the direct and indirect losses are countless. However, if the steam pipes of the small boilers rust over time and cannot be replaced or washed, it will inevitably lead to the deterioration of machine parts, and the complete shutdown of work is to be expected. Therefore, I once accompanied Engineer Ge to meet with the factory head and suggested everything, but the results were all rejected." In order to ease the dissatisfaction of the workers, the factory appointed technician Chen Laisheng to replace Ge Zupeng. As soon as he took over, he completely overturned the previous plan. A storm was calmed down. (Special Correspondent Shao Shenzhi)

Textile Federation's Second General Meeting Held Opening Ceremony Yesterday 221 Representatives from Various Places Attended

[Our Newspaper] The second general meeting of the National Machine Cotton Textile Industry Association was held at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce at 10:30 AM yesterday. A total of 221 representatives from various places attended. Officials present included Mayor Wu, Pan Xulun representing the President of the Executive Yuan, Liu Siying of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and letters from Speaker Ji Gongzhan, Deputy Speaker Xu Jiqing, and Tian Heqing representing the Industrial Association. The meeting elected Du Yuesheng, Shu Yunzhang, Wang Qiyu, Pan Yangshan, Li Shengzhi, and 15 others as the presidium. After Du Yuesheng delivered the opening speech, Shu Yunzhang reported on the significance of the meeting, stating that the association was initially the China Merchant Yarn Factory Association. Before the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, it formed the National Yarn Factory Association. At that time, there were only 2 million spindles, but today it has increased to 4.5 million. The preparation time in between was one year. Only the 4th, 5th, 10th, and 8th districts, as well as Hunan and Shanxi, have not yet formed an association due to the small number of spindles. The major issues facing China's cotton textile industry are: raw cotton, machine parts, and talent cultivation. If these three major problems are not resolved, the future of the textile industry cannot be optimistic. This is also what should be discussed and resolved at the meeting. China's textile industry has suffered from Japanese oppression in the past, but today is a good opportunity to revitalize it. The development prospects of China's textile industry have the advantages of a vast cotton output and a large number of workers. Therefore, the industry already has the foundation to immediately develop to 10 million and 15 million spindles.

Shu Yunzhang Reports on Preparation Process

After Shu's report, Wu Weijing reported on the preparation process of the meeting, saying that the preparation began on August 15, with a total of seven preparation committee members. The method of generating representatives followed the previous regulations, and a total of 251 representatives should be generated. Today, 221 attended, with 48 proposals and a meeting budget of 200 million yuan.

Zhang, President of the Executive Yuan Analyzes Five Major Issues

Next, Pan Xulun, representing Zhang Le, President of the Executive Yuan, delivered a speech, with the main points being: The textile industry made great contributions during the Anti-Japanese War, which is commendable. It is hoped that it will continue to contribute, make the greatest efforts, and overcome the current difficulties. There are currently five major problems in the textile industry: state-owned and private issues, competition from Japanese textile industry, raw material issues, cost issues, and control issues. Regarding the first issue, the Ministry of Economic Affairs has regulations, and the issue of complete privatization needs to be resolved gradually. Regarding the second issue, the government is fully cracking down on smuggling of Japanese goods, so the competition with Japanese textiles is abroad and not at home. Regarding the third issue, the government has plans to expand raw cotton production, so there is no major problem. The fourth issue is high costs and insufficient electricity. The government's countermeasure is to control electricity use by the people and transfer it to production, which has been approved by the Executive Yuan. The fifth issue is control. No control and complete control are not feasible. The compromise adopted is joint distribution. I wish the textile industry success.

Mayor Wu Encourages Seizing the Opportunity

Mayor Wu's speech emphasized the following points: The textile industry must seize the opportunity and have an optimistic attitude, because textiles are a daily necessity industry, and the government will definitely assist in achieving self-sufficiency. There is no need to worry about opening up trade with Japan, as Japan also has difficulties. The difficulties of high labor costs and insufficient electricity can also be overcome. It is hoped that inspections and reforms will start from the bottom up, such as improving product quality, improving worker treatment, and achieving labor-management cooperation, which are all extremely important. Liu Siying of the Textile Adjustment Committee stated that although the textile industry is a light industry, it is the foundation for national rejuvenation. Only with this can heavy industry be established. It is hoped that the greatest efforts will be made to overcome the current difficulties.

Speaker Pan Emphasizes Overcoming the Environment

Speaker Pan Gongzhan stated that after the second general meeting of the Textile Federation, the Ministry of Economic Affairs' production meeting will be convened on the 25th, which proves the government's emphasis on the textile industry, using this to communicate opinions. He also said that although the current environment is difficult, there should be planned optimism, and it should not lead to disappointment and pessimism. Subsequently, guests Xu Jisu, Tian Heqing, Li Guocheng, Shi Fengxiang, and others gave speeches successively. The meeting then passed a telegram of tribute to President Chiang.

### Regarding Zhang Yi's Views on Hu Shi's University Plan: Acknowledges the Remarkable Achievements of Fudan and Nankai Universities and Suggests They Be Ranked First

[This Newspaper's Report] Fudan University President Zhang Yi, when speaking to reporters about the current state of general university education, stated: Currently, the operation of university education is struggling amid poverty. The funding of some universities is already very tight. If special pressure is applied to further reduce their funding, their development will become increasingly difficult and eventually stagnate. Operating education is essentially a spiritual undertaking. Universities that genuinely strive for progress amidst hardship are even more valuable than those that develop with special economic power from the government, and the government should find ways to encourage them. The government should generally increase funding for all schools by two or three times, and then, based on objective facts and their performance, provide special funding to help them develop as much as possible. As for whether a university is excellent, it should be judged by its achievements and the talents it has cultivated in the past, as well as the activities and facilities within the school. To encourage and improve teaching standards, special subsidies can be given to particularly excellent departments in various schools. There are "missionary," "private," and "national" universities in our country. Missionary universities have always received donations from abroad or from private individuals. Private universities often rely on influential figures to solicit donations. Although national universities are supplied by the government, the bias is very significant. For example, northern universities receive as much as 2.5 billion yuan in funding at a time, while Shanghai schools rarely receive that amount, receiving only 700-800 million yuan each time, and they still have to travel back and forth between 京 and 滬 [Beijing and Shanghai], which is very regrettable. Zhang also commented on Peking University President Hu Shi's thirty-year university education plan, stating: If the government's funding is insufficient and it concentrates its efforts on supporting a few universities, there is no major issue in principle. However, the contributions of universities that have sought development amidst hardship since their establishment should not be denied to the country and the nation. To evaluate their excellence based on history, Jiaotong University was established fifty years ago and is one of the earliest universities in our country. As for the achievements in operating schools, Fudan and Nankai Universities have outstanding achievements and should be ranked first. Zhang concluded by saying: University education is not a matter of seeking relief but should seek academic independence and freedom of thought. Fudan University has developed to where it is today through hard work and will continue to improve student quality by strengthening teaching and strictly examinations, and will also improve the lives of professors.
