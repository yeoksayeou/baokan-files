### US House Foreign Affairs Committee Report Urges Emergency Aid to Europe and Asia; Announces Existing Soviet Armed Forces Numbers

[Our Newspaper News] New York, 3rd Radio: Washington News - The US House Foreign Affairs Committee submitted a report to the House today, strongly urging emergency aid of $590 million to Europe and China, and immediate action to prevent the spread of communism. It stated: Currently, the Soviet Union has 4,050,000 armed personnel, according to the Department of the Army's investigation. The report stated that the Soviet Union clearly has a clear and definite policy, attempting to prevent American aid to Europe and Asia, and to make it ineffective as much as possible. It also stated: When assisting other countries, we must also strengthen our own country, so that we can unite with all freedom-loving countries to prevent any unforeseen events.

[Our Newspaper News] New York, 3rd Radio: Washington News - The US House Foreign Affairs Committee issued a report stating: The Soviet Union is attempting to undermine American aid to Europe and Asia, and trying its best to make it expensive, so that the United States suffers economic losses. The committee also released figures from the Department of the Army, stating that the Soviet Union and its satellite countries currently have 5,213,000 armed personnel, while freedom-loving countries in Europe can immediately muster only 3,416,000, a ratio of approximately five to three. The report strongly urged the swift passage of the $590 million in emergency foreign aid, including $60 million in temporary aid to China, and believed that the work of aiding Europe has a good chance of success, and that the gradual abandonment of communism by Europeans is becoming increasingly obvious, as evidenced by the exclusion of the communist parties of France and Italy from the cabinet. The House decided to discuss the emergency foreign aid bill on Thursday.

[Our Newspaper News] New York, 3rd Radio: Washington News - The Chairman of the US House Foreign Affairs Committee, Eaton, read a report to the House Rules Committee today, strongly urging the accelerated passage of the emergency foreign aid bill, which will be submitted to the House for discussion on Thursday. Eaton said: The Soviet Union could occupy all of Europe within 24 hours, but currently does not want a real war to break out immediately. If the Soviet Union occupied France and Italy through the hands of the French and Italian communist parties, it could then occupy Greece and Turkey.

### Foreign Minister Wang Reports on Diplomacy; American Congressional and Public Attention Now Focused on Europe; Aid to China and the Japanese Peace Treaty Issues Greatly Affected

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 3rd] Foreign Minister Wang Shijie reported on diplomacy at a gathering on the 3rd, stating: The situation in Europe is gradually tightening, labor strikes are surging in various countries, and the Italian Communist Party will also take action. American congressional and public attention is focused on Europe, so aid to China and the Japanese peace treaty issues are greatly affected. The Ministry has not yet received the replies from the US and UK regarding the Japanese peace treaty, and we are studying the Soviet reply. Regarding the issue of Romania, Wang stated: Since the coup in that country, our side has maintained an attitude of observation and is awaiting detailed and accurate reports. Whether to recognize its new government has not been decided, and the same is true for the US and UK. As for the Romanian Ambassador to China, Dulesla, who was recently dismissed by the government, we do not deny Dulesla's legitimate status before we recognize their new government.

### Ministry of Foreign Affairs Implements Internal and External Rotation System

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 3rd] Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, Ye Gongchao, stated at a press conference on the 3rd that the Ministry is gradually implementing an internal and external rotation system. He cited the example of the Acting Director of the Intelligence Department, who was also present today, saying that the Director of the Era Department was originally the Consul-General in South Africa, and was transferred back to the Ministry to serve as Acting Director of the Intelligence Department, as the original Director, Zhang Yuanzhang, had fallen ill and was temporarily unable to return to the country. Ye Gongchao analyzed the obstacles to the Ministry's implementation of the internal and external rotation system, saying that there are currently three major difficulties preventing the full implementation of the internal and external rotation system: 1. Our country lacks means of transportation, making travel difficult for transferred personnel; 2. The Ministry's funds are limited and unwilling to spend too much foreign exchange; 3. Talent is lacking. He also explained the last point, saying that the Ministry still pays attention to the recruitment of talent.

### Allied Headquarters in Japan Agreed to Our Sending Military Police to Japan Long Ago; Sending an Occupation Army is Temporarily Difficult to Realize

[Our Newspaper News] According to the person in charge of the Shanghai Office of the Delegation to Japan: "The Allied Headquarters has already agreed in principle to our country sending military police to Japan, but the number is still under negotiation. The head of the trade mission believes that the number should not be too small, and should be a complete team. The logistics and accommodation of the military police after they go to Japan will be handled by our country." When asked by reporters whether the dispatch of military police might be followed by the dispatch of an occupation army, he replied: "This matter cannot be realized at present, because firstly, there are difficulties in foreign exchange. The consumption of a division of people abroad is quite considerable. Secondly, there is currently a major housing problem in Japan. The American troops in Japan are currently building extensively. If our country sends a division of people there, then barracks and warehouses will all become problems, so the matter of sending an occupation army to Japan cannot become a reality in the short term."

Canton Customs Seizes Private Goods Worth Hundreds of Billions in Eleven Months; Soong Tzu-wen Emphasizes Increasing Import Quotas

[Our Newspaper, Guangzhou, 3rd] According to the person in charge of customs: From January to November of this year, private goods worth over 100 billion yuan have been seized. The amount is so large that the total tax revenue for the year is also behind it. The prevalence of smuggling is truly alarming. Soong Tzu-wen reported in the Provincial Assembly that although the Central Government has signed an anti-smuggling agreement with Hong Kong, and the customs and shipping have strengthened inspections, it will be difficult to prevent smuggling if the province's required raw materials cannot obtain a reasonable amount of imports. If the province's request for 18% of the import quota is approved by the Central Government, then smuggling can be prevented immediately.

[Another Dispatch] In order to assist the government in controlling the export ban on rice, the Canton Customs has strengthened inspections. On the 2nd, it seized several loads of white rice smuggled for export on various ships, and all of it was confiscated. Since Hong Kong has not yet proposed a counter-proposal, neither has been signed. Regarding the Lushun-Dalian issue, a reporter asked whether there had been any other contact besides the note we sent to the Soviet Union last month. Ye replied: Our note was purely to declare our position, and there has been no other contact. Apart from this, Ye did not answer any of the reporter's questions related to the Lushun-Dalian issue.

### North China Bandit Suppression Headquarters to be Established Within a Week; Rumor that Fu Zuoyi will Resign as Chairman of Chahar Province

[Our Newspaper, Peiping, 3rd] Related authorities said: The Ministry of National Defense issued an order yesterday, limiting the establishment of the North China Bandit Suppression Headquarters to within one week. It will operate in Peiping in the short term, and will be moved to Fengtai after the merger of the Zhangjiakou and Baoding Pacification Headquarters is completed. The Commander-in-Chief will have two or three Deputy Commanders-in-Chief, stationed in various important towns in Chahar and Suiyuan. The candidates will be selected from Chen Jicheng, Shangguan Yunxiang, Song Kentang, and Deng Baoshan. It is rumored that Fu Zuoyi will resign from his position as Chairman of Chahar Province to concentrate on military command. The new chairmen of Rehe and Chahar provinces may be announced at the same time. The highest authorities have asked Fu Zuoyi to consider suitable candidates. Although the National Government has clearly ordered that the jurisdiction of this headquarters be Shanxi, Hebei, Rehe, Chahar, and Suiyuan, in reality, Shanxi Province will only include Yanbei, and the Taiyuan Pacification Headquarters will remain as it is. The rumor that a Hebei-Rehe-Liaoning Border Region Headquarters will be established is not accurate. Moreover, after the establishment of the headquarters, the names of the pacification zones within its jurisdiction (such as Western Rehe) will be cancelled, and three or four army corps will be formed under the headquarters to control the various armies. Although the headquarters' organization has not yet arrived, it will generally be the same as the pacification headquarters. In principle, the Peiping Executive Headquarters will still be in a supervisory position, and Sun Lianzhong will only be responsible for the administrative duties of Hebei Province. When reporters asked about the development of the situation in North China and the issue of troop strength after the establishment of the headquarters, a qualified person said: The development will be at the beginning of next year, and the existing troop strength is sufficient, because the past failures were due to the failure to mobilize troop strength between various regions. When reporters asked whether the bandits in Jinxi and northern Jinbei would form another target for bandit intrusion if the troop strength in Chahar and Suiyuan were transferred elsewhere in the future, he said: There is no need to worry. Fu Zuoyi has already trained a powerful reserve army in Chahar and Suiyuan, and the Central Government has provided them with excellent equipment. Regarding the future coordination of military and government affairs, he said that Fu Zuoyi is working on formulating a concrete plan to correct the disconnected phenomena of the past.

[Another Dispatch] The newly appointed Commander of Bandit Suppression in Yanbei, Yu Zhenhe, took a car to Datong this morning to take office.

[Our Newspaper, Peiping, 3rd] Fu Zuoyi continued to contact various parties today, and his headquarters' preparatory office will start operating at the International Friendship Association tomorrow.

[Another Dispatch] Military News: According to reports, the communist bandits are discussing countermeasures against the newly established bandit suppression organization in North China. In addition to Peng Dehuai and He Long convening a high-level cadre meeting in the Northwest, Nie Rongzhen also convened a cadre meeting in Shijiazhuang.

[Another Dispatch] "The establishment of the Financial Management Bureau is only the government's initial foray into the current economic control measures."

### Communist Bandit's Old Nest in Northern Jiangsu, Hede Town, Recaptured

The agricultural oil mill established there by the communist bandits, along with tens of thousands of books, were all seized by the National Army. It was also learned from the confessions of prisoners that this place was actually the political and economic center and supply base of the communist bandits in Northern Jiangsu at this stage. The remaining communist bandit units, the 11th and 12th columns in Northern Jiangsu, have suffered a serious blow and will feel increasingly impoverished in the future. The troops of the Huaihai Pacification Zone began to advance east from the south bank of the Liutang River east of Hanshui in the middle of last month, passed through the old Yellow River in Yancheng, broke through the strong resistance of the 11th and 12th columns of communist bandits, and finally reached the south bank of the Sheyang River at the end of last month and captured the Hede Town area.

### Deng Wenyi Reports on the War Situation for a Week; Bandit Army in a Passive Position is on the Road to Collapse

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 3rd] Deng Wenyi, Director of the News Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense, reported on the war situation for the week of November 26 to December 2 at a press conference on the afternoon of the 3rd, stating:

North China

This week, the war situation in North China was generally relatively peaceful. Due to the appointment of General Fu Zuoyi as the Commander-in-Chief of the North China Bandit Suppression Headquarters, the merger of the Zhangjiakou and Baoding Pacification Headquarters, the unified command of the front-line operations in North China, and the enhanced lineup of bandit suppression in North China, the war situation in that area will definitely have new developments in the future. In the northern section of the Peiping-Hankou Railway, except for the fact that the bandit army continued to attack Yuanshi day and night after the 27th of this month, and once approached the city walls several times. After the defending army counterattacked with bloodshed and the air force assisted in repeated bombing and strafing, the bandit army suffered heavy casualties. Only bandit troops were found in the vicinity of Baoding, wandering and guerrilla in areas ranging from a dozen to forty or fifty li from the city, and there was no major contact between the two sides.

Northeast

In the Northeast, after the failure of the sixth offensive by the bandit army, their manpower and material resources suffered very significant losses in all aspects. Judging from the wounded soldiers alone, it is estimated that there were more than 40,000 wounded and sick soldiers gathered south of Jilin in Shulinzi on November 24 and 25, waiting to be transported. Recently, Haicheng and Dashiqiao were recaptured, the railway between Panyang and Yingkou was once again under the control of the National Army, and the weather was cold, the bandit army lacked winter combat equipment, so the bandit troops on both sides of the China Changchun Railway retreated to the mountainous areas of Liaoyuan Shuangshan and Xi'an Xifeng, searching for food and clothing, and forcibly conscripting militia to reorganize and replenish; however, in mid-November, the 29th Division of the 10th Column of the bandit army in northern Jilin defected entirely in the area north of Jiutai, and fled in disarray. This is the most obvious example of the low morale and wavering military spirit of the bandit army in the Northeast.

Northern Shaanxi

In Northern Shaanxi, the victory of the National Army in the Battle of Yulin, on the one hand, demonstrated the loyalty, bravery, and good fighting skills of the Northwest Cavalry under General Ma Hongkui's command. In this battle, the communist bandits suffered repeated blows, initially encountering resistance in Yulin, and then suffering setbacks in Shahe, resulting in losses of more than 20,000 people, creating a brilliant victory for the National Army in the Northwest, and stabilizing the overall war situation in the Northwest. The remaining bandits transferred their forces and attacked Sanbian. Because Anbian only had a company of defending troops, it was captured. Ma's reinforcements will arrive soon and it will not be difficult to recapture.

Shaanxi-Henan Border

The Kong Congzhou bandits on the Henan-Shaanxi border have been wandering around Shangnan, Hanchuanguan, Shaanxi, and Zhen'an this week. Initially, they were intercepted everywhere by our local militia, and were exhausted from running around. They were then fatally attacked by the National Army, and have been cut into two sections. Apart from a part that fled back to the Tai Shan Temple and Checun areas northeast of the Funiu Mountains, a part is still perishing in Shaanxi, Zhen'an, and Xixiang. The National Army is searching and suppressing them separately. The Chen Zhong's Fourth Column in Western Henan has been so badly damaged by our militia in Neixiang and Zhenping that they have lost more than half of their strength, and had to flee to the mountain Tai Shan Temple, Checun area in the north of Neixiang. The 9th Column is in the Fangcheng and Tanghe area, and another part of the 26th Brigade of the 9th Column has been isolated by the National Army and the militia, and is still wandering in the Song County and Chi Zhen area. There is also a part stationed near Yu City, the 22nd Brigade, and the 31st Brigade; the remaining bandits who fled back from Kong Congzhou fled east again after the National Army occupied Yu City. Now it is raining and snowing everywhere in Henan, and the weather is cold and freezing. The bandit army lacks food and clothing, and has no new actions other than trying to loot as much as possible.

Dabie Mountains Area

The 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 6th Columns of Liu Bocheng's bandit troops on the southern foothills of the Dabie Mountains have been wandering around Susong, Guangji, Huangmei, Xishui, and Macheng this week, attempting to use the cover of the lake and pond area in eastern Hubei to avoid strength and preserve their forces, and also to prepare for a plan to secretly cross the Yangtze River. Due to the overwhelming pressure of our superior army, they could not stand on the riverside, and fled north one after another. After the National Army entered and occupied Taihu, Yingshan, and Luotian, most of the bandits were defeated and gathered in the area south of Fubei, northeast, and Guangshan and Luoshan, echoing Chen Yi in the north, with the possibility of preparing to fight a decisive battle with the National Army in the Dabie Mountain area.

Western Shandong and Northern Anhui

In addition, the 1st, 3rd, 4th, and 6th Columns of Chen Yi's bandit army, which fled south from Taihe and Mengyang, have mostly crossed the Shahe River and gathered in the southeast of Shenqiu, seemingly attempting to support Liu Bocheng in Xincai and Hanchuan, to preserve the foothills of the Dabie Mountains, and to save the critical situation after the National Army occupied Lihuang and Taihu. If necessary, they can also provide a reception for Liu's bandit army to flee north, but since Jinxiang was relieved on November 26, the 10th, 11th, and 8th Columns of the bandit army retreated to the west of Shan County, Cao County, and Chengwu. Looking at the entire situation of the bandit army east of the Peiping-Hankou Railway and south of the Yellow River, the bandit army is completely in a passive position. Severe winter is approaching, they have lost their strongholds, are attacked by militia, and have difficulty in supplying. They are gradually losing the three conditions of timing, location, and harmony, and are on the road to collapse day by day.

Editorial

### Implementation of the Housing Rental Ordinance

Since the victory in the War of Resistance, housing rental disputes have remained unresolved. To reasonably address the housing shortage, eliminate the existing malpractices in housing rental methods, and protect the vested property rights of homeowners, the Legislative Yuan, after repeated careful discussions and soliciting opinions from local public opinion organs and experts, passed the "Housing Rental Ordinance," which was officially promulgated and implemented by the National Government on the first day [of the month]. When the Legislative Yuan carefully deliberated the ordinance, public opinion in various places called for the early promulgation of reasonable rental regulations. The Fourth Plenary Session of the China Law Society further suggested that the government promptly formulate rental ordinances to facilitate the handling of housing disputes. The Legislative Yuan adopted public opinion, resulting in the passage of the Housing Rental Ordinance. After carefully reading the content of the ordinance, we deeply feel that the legislative spirit is impartial and unbiased, neither rigidly adhering to the facts nor focusing solely on theory. The original legislative intention seems to be to protect tenants (renters), support landlords (property owners), and crack down on subletting (sub-landlords), so that the due interests of all three parties can be taken into account. This legislative spirit is fair and reasonable, and we believe it should be elaborated upon:

First, the purpose of formulating this ordinance seems to be to regulate the supply and demand of housing. "For houses that can be lived in, but are currently not for self-use or rent, the government may order them to be rented out within a limited period of one month. For houses for self-use that exceed actual needs, according to the provisions of Article 96 of the Land Law, the government may order the excess houses to be rented out within a limited period." The main purpose of its second article is to restrict the possession of houses as private property; all houses should serve the public to regulate supply and demand and solve the housing shortage. The so-called "actual needs" are difficult to have a clear standard, which can easily lead to disturbances. With the protection of the people's interests as the premise, it seems that the provincial and municipal governments should provide reasonable remedies when formulating supplementary measures.

Second, to determine the rental deposit system. Rent is the legal income of the landlord. "When a house is rented, a deposit may be collected in addition to the rent. The maximum amount of the deposit shall not exceed the total amount of two months' rent." Article 3 stipulates that rent shall be "paid monthly" in principle, and the "maximum amount" of rent "may be restricted by the government in charge with the consent of the public opinion organ, according to the local economic situation." It also stipulates that "the lessor (landlord) shall not collect tips or any other fees in any name other than the rent deposit." Violators will be fined according to law. The main purpose is to determine the amount and payment of rent, the ratio and amount of the deposit; and to determine the housing rental relationship, except for the rent deposit as the legal rights and interests of the landlord, no extra extortion or unreasonable demands shall be made. This has protective significance for both lessors and lessees.

Third, to restrict the subletting of houses. Subletting is a bad system. The so-called "sub-landlord" is produced by subletting; the fees charged for subletting, that is, the so-called "transfer fee," are also unreasonable and illegal malpractices. This ordinance adopts a restrictive approach to subletting, stipulating that "the lessee shall not sublet the entire house to others. If a part of the house is sublet, if the contract has an opposing stipulation, the lessor shall first give written consent, or the sublet contract shall be sent to the lessor for signature. The sublet rent shall be calculated according to the ratio of the sublet part of the house to the original rent, and shall not exceed one time the original rent. If there is an original deposit, the calculation of the deposit shall be the same, and half of the part of the rent deposit exceeding the original amount shall be paid to the lessor. No transfer fee, tips or any other fees in any name shall be collected for subletting the house." The main purpose of this at least contains three key points: The house shall not be sublet in its entirety. If the original contract between the lessee and the lessor allows it, only part of it can be sublet, but the lessor has the right to agree. This is to prevent the free transfer of the house; There are certain restrictions on sublet rent and deposit, and the lessor can enjoy the income from subletting. This is to eliminate the intermediate exploitation of subletting; Abolish transfer fees, tips or other disguised extortion. Therefore, it can be said that this ordinance is a special law to strictly crack down on transfer and protect the property rights of landlords.

Fourth, to protect the stability of the tenant's residence. The tenant rents a house from the landlord according to law, which is the tenant's right to reside and shall not be interfered with unless otherwise provided by law. Therefore, this article is to protect the rights and interests of tenants; to avoid extortion by landlords, it stipulates that the lessor shall not terminate the contractual relationship unless one of the following circumstances exists: The lessee uses the house for purposes that violate laws and regulations; The lessee owes more than two months' rent in addition to offsetting the deposit; Intentionally or negligently damages the house without repairing it or providing considerable compensation; Sublets the house to others without the lessor's consent; The lessor submits conclusive proof of recovering the house for self-use upon expiration of the contract; The agreed lease term has expired; The lessee closes the house and does not use it for six months; The house must be rebuilt. However, "if the house is still rented out after reconstruction, the original tenant has the priority to rent it." In addition, "if the house is recovered for self-use; if it is left idle for more than three months, or is rented to others within one year, the original tenant has the right to request continued rent and may request compensation for damages." If the lessor "forces the lessee to move out without reason during the continuation of the lease relationship, the lessee may ask the judicial organ to provide effective protection." The main purpose of these regulations is to protect the tenant's right to residence. The legislation is comprehensive, taking into account human relations, and at the same time restricting the lessor from using high pressure against the tenant or changing the lease relationship without following the law.

In addition to this, this ordinance has two major characteristics: one is that in the areas where this ordinance is implemented, the regulations stipulate that "agencies that provide dormitories for their staff shall not collect rent. Those who do not provide dormitories shall be given a considerable amount of subsidy." This has special preferential meaning for personnel serving in public affairs agencies. Secondly, in order to seek urban social welfare, this ordinance also stipulates that people should be encouraged to build houses.

Therefore, the "Housing Rental Ordinance" is two progressive social legislations. The realization of this progressive and social nature depends on the effective implementation of the law. First of all, local governments must enforce it effectively, without favoritism or personal feelings, so that it can become popular; secondly, people of all classes must abide by the law and obey all the provisions of the law. If the people do not abide by the law, even if the government and the courts enforce the law strictly, the progressiveness and social nature of the law will disappear. Therefore, we believe that in order to reasonably solve the housing shortage and balance the rental relationship, the government should implement this ordinance well, so that the current bad atmosphere can be reversed.

### Director Dong and Deputy Minister Ye Answer Reporters' Questions

[Our newspaper Nanjing, 3rd] Director Dong Xian Guang and Deputy Foreign Minister Ye Gong Chao answered questions at the press conference of the Executive Yuan News Bureau on the 3rd as follows:

Director Dong's answer: There is nothing particularly surprising about the rumor that the Communist Party plans to establish a Far East International News Agency. The issue of improving the treatment of public officials is being studied by the competent government authorities, and a practical solution will be found soon. According to the information provided by the Ministry of Justice, as of June 36, the total number of corruption cases concluded by courts across the country in the past two and a half years was 16,794. 17,454 civil servants were involved, of which 6,385 have been sentenced, including 1 executed, 32 sentenced to life imprisonment, 671 sentenced to imprisonment for more than 10 years, 2,554 sentenced to imprisonment for more than 5 years but less than 10 years, and 3,127 sentenced to imprisonment for more than 1 year but less than 5 years. There are still some cases that have not been concluded, and the defendants include Chu Xin, the former mayor of Nanchang, Zhou Yanming, the former director of the Pearl River Navigation Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Communications, Lu Shouren, the former director of the Yunnan Civil Affairs Department, Xu Jizhuang, the former director of the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau, Shen Jing, the former manager of the Shanghai branch of the bureau, Hu Mai, the former director of the Hunan Tianliang Office, Wang Xidiao, the former director of the Tianjin Public Utilities Bureau, Qiu Ruiquan, the former member of the Qingdao Municipal Party Committee, Zhang Legu, the former national senator, Wang Rangqian, the former president of the Jinan Provincial Hospital, and others. After the establishment of the Financial Administration, the bureau will exercise unified authority in cracking down on illegal speculation in the financial control market. The government is determined to prevent speculation and stabilize prices, hence the establishment of the bureau. In recent days, the price stability phenomenon has already occurred in the Shanghai market, and the government will also strengthen the management of cotton yarn and cloth.

Deputy Foreign Minister Ye's answer: The Chinese government is currently studying the Soviet Union's reply to China's proposals regarding the peace conference with Japan.

The Chinese government is still closely watching the development of the internal affairs of Siam. The Chinese government has not withdrawn its recognition of the Siamese ambassador to China.

Since the US China Act is still under discussion in the US Congress, I do not intend to comment on it at this time.

### ### US, Britain, and France Advocate a Peace Conference with Germany, China Should Be Listed as a Convening Nation, Soviet Representative Still Firmly Opposed

[Reuters, London, 2nd] At today's Foreign Ministers' Conference, the Western nations and the Soviet Union were divided over the issue of China's participation in a future German peace conference. Marshall stated that it was agreed in the Potsdam Conference that the Foreign Ministers' Conference dealing with German issues should include the five powers, including China, and he deeply hoped to abide by the stipulations of the Potsdam Conference. Molotov, however, opposed Marshall's interpretation, arguing that China could only be a convening nation for the Japanese peace conference, as China did not sign the German surrender document, and the Potsdam Agreement only referred to member nations of the Foreign Ministers' Conference that signed the surrender document. The foreign ministers of Britain and France both expressed their support for China as a convening nation for the German peace conference. As a result, this point failed to reach an agreement. The discussion of the China issue arose when the Western nations and the Soviet Union clashed over the following two questions: Which of the smaller allied nations should participate in the committee drafting the German peace treaty; Which nations should participate in the information and advisory conference. Although the four powers acknowledged that among the nations that declared war on Germany, the order of declarations, the severity of war losses, and their relationship to the peace treaty were not all the same, they still could not agree on which nations should be listed in which category.

[Reuters, London, 2nd] The four foreign ministers held their seventh meeting today. Britain and the US strongly advocated that smaller allied nations have the right to participate in the four main committees drafting the German peace treaty. Marshall even cited Canada as an example. The Foreign Ministers' Conference still has four points to be decided today: The organization of the main committees of the German peace conference; Whether China should participate in the conference; Which nations should compose the subcommittee; The information committee of the peace conference. Molotov originally suggested that the four main committees of the peace conference should only be attended by the four powers. Later, upon the suggestion of M. Mieuville, representative of French Foreign Minister Bidault, that the four powers invite representatives of smaller allied nations to participate, Molotov abandoned his original suggestion and accepted the French proposal. However, Britain believed that these four main committees should be composed of the four powers together with the previously listed nineteen nations, including Pakistan, while the United States advocated that they should be composed of the four powers together with an appropriate number of other nations. As a result, the opinions of the British-American side and the Soviet-French side could not be reconciled, and no agreement was reached. The Foreign Ministers' Conference then discussed the China issue, but without result. Then they discussed the organization of the information committee. Britain and France advocated that it should be composed of the five powers together with the nineteen allied nations and some other unspecified nations, while the Soviet Union insisted that it could only be composed of the five powers and the other nineteen nations, and agreed to the British-French suggestion that other belligerent nations could provide opinions, but not participate. Marshall, however, advocated that all members of the United Nations that had declared war on Germany should have the right to participate in the information conference.

### ### Four Foreign Ministers Begin to Address the Austrian Peace Treaty Issue, Representatives' Meeting Submits Report for Review

[United Press, London, 3rd] The four foreign ministers are preparing to address the Austrian peace treaty issue today. Austrian Foreign Minister Gruber met with British Foreign Secretary Bevin and US Secretary of State Marshall this morning. Prime Minister Attlee hosted a banquet for the four foreign ministers at Number 10 Downing Street.

[Reuters, London, 2nd] The report of the four powers' representatives reviewing the French compromise proposal on the issue of German assets in Austria was submitted to the Foreign Ministers' Conference on the 2nd and was decided by the Foreign Ministers' Conference to be reviewed on the 3rd. The report recorded the Soviet Union's opposition to the French compromise proposal and the general acceptance of it by the British and American representatives.

[Associated Press, London, 3rd] The Foreign Ministers' Conference is nearing its end today on the matter of drafting the German peace treaty, but no progress has been made on major issues. The Austrian peace treaty issue will be addressed next. Some American representatives believe that the current conference only proves two points: that the Soviet Union and the Western nations cannot find a compromise basis regarding the future of Germany for the time being, and that Molotov is determined to use the conference as a venue for delivering political speeches to the German people. Mr. Molotov has undoubtedly been very successful in this regard.

### ### Four Foreign Ministers Invited to Attend Royal Tea Party

[Associated Press, London, 2nd] Official sources announced today after the adjournment of the Four Power Foreign Ministers' Conference that King George has invited US Secretary of State Marshall and the foreign ministers of Britain, the Soviet Union, and France to a tea party at Buckingham Palace tomorrow evening.

### ### Dulles Goes to France, Bidault Returns to London

[Associated Press, London, 3rd] US Secretary of State Marshall's Republican advisor Dulles plans to go to Paris tomorrow to consult with French leaders on the country's foreign policy concerning the current domestic crisis. According to well-informed responsible sources, Dulles' trip is a "personal on-the-spot investigation" approved by Secretary Marshall.

[United Press, London, 3rd] The French Foreign Minister returned to London this morning after rushing back to Paris and immediately met with Deputy Foreign Minister Mieuville.

[Central News Agency, London, 2nd] Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky arrived in Southampton today aboard the "Queen Mary" from New York. He is going to London to assist Molotov in discussing the German and Austrian peace treaties at the Foreign Ministers' Conference.

### ### Truman Goes on Vacation to Florida

### ### France and Italy's Economies Are Exhausted and Urgently Awaiting American Loans, All Hope the US House of Representatives Will Quickly Pass

[Reuters, Washington, 2nd] State Department officials confirmed today that unless the House of Representatives quickly passes the emergency aid bill for France, Italy, and Austria that has already been passed by the Senate, supplies to these countries will soon be interrupted. Within this week, without the allocation of emergency funds, important factories in France will be forced to shut down at the beginning of next year. France originally planned to use its remaining US$100 million in US currency this month to pay for chemicals, basic materials, and industrial raw materials, but now it may have to change to paying for urgently needed coal and grain. The US Commodity Loan Bank has already purchased 150,000 tons of grain on behalf of Italy, but with Italy's US dollars exhausted, this grain will not be able to be shipped without emergency aid funds.

### ### Republicans Accuse Truman of Misusing Export Control Authority

[United Press, Washington, 12th] The US House International Commerce Committee approved a resolution on the 2nd requesting the Department of Commerce to prepare for Congress a complete list of all important goods and materials exported during the year. The committee approved this resolution at an indefinite meeting. Based on legislation, the committee, using the resolution advocated by Congressman Mett, requested a list limited to exports to the Soviet Union and its satellite countries. Previously, Republican leaders were considering approving legislation to force President Truman to tighten export controls as a measure to prevent currency inflation. Hurlock stated that the Republican Comprehensive Committee had discussed setting up appropriate management to cancel some of the president's management authority regarding export controls, but no resolution was reached. Republicans have criticized Truman for failing to effectively use his export control law, which will expire on January 29.

### ### The Situation in France Is Still Chaotic, Conflicts Between Police and Workers Occur Everywhere, Parliament Passes Two Articles of the Anti-Strike Law

[Associated Press, Paris, 3rd] The French Parliament this morning, with a decisive majority overwhelming the opposition of the Communists, passed the first article of Prime Minister Schumann's anti-strike bill by a vote of 402 to 183, stipulating that current laws be suspended for three months, and those who encourage and carry out strikes may be sentenced to imprisonment for no more than three months and a fine of no more than 180,000 francs. Only the Communist group voted against it. The bill has five articles in total, and the remaining four articles will be submitted for discussion and voting one by one, and then the entire bill will be submitted for a final vote. [Associated Press, Paris, 3rd] The French Parliament received news this morning that a train near Arras had derailed due to striking workers, and immediately passed the second article of Prime Minister Schumann's anti-strike law, and adjourned at 9:00.

[Reuters, Paris, 3rd] The French cabinet is scheduled to meet on the 3rd to discuss the current political and social situation. The meeting will be personally presided over by President Auriol, and the date of the first meeting of the French Federation (including France and its colonies) will also be discussed.

[Reuters, Paris, 2nd] Police today used tear gas to drive out striking workers occupying the Paris Limoges station and garage, and the conflict lasted for several hours before ending. The situation in Marseille is becoming tense, and conflicts between strikers and military police are happening frequently. Workers, in groups of hundreds, rush into various factories and workplaces, forcing them to close. The French labor unrest is threatening to spread to the Principality of Monaco on the Mediterranean coast. The government of that country broadcast to the people, instructing them to refuse to participate in the strike.

### ### Sabotage of Railways, Mail Car Overturns

[United Press, Paris, 3rd] French slowdown workers attempted to violently obstruct the railway workers' return to work by sabotaging the railway between Paris and Arras, causing the mail car to overturn.

### Conveying the Culture of Border Nationalities Xinjiang Song and Dance Troupe Arrives in Shanghai Tides of Welcoming Crowds Hu Die and Ye Meng Present Flowers Stars Joyfully Shake Hands

[Report from our newspaper] The Xinjiang Youth Song and Dance Visiting Troupe, including Kangbarhan, Pufeng, Minawa, Shuyida, Tursunhan, Nazhiye, and others, totaling fifty-three people, led by Deputy Head Yifu, arrived in Shanghai yesterday via the Qiantang PC603 train from Beijing. Representatives from various circles, including Xie Renjian, Yu Wen, Tan Yimin, Liu Ming, representatives from the Xinjiang Shanghai Association, including Yitongkan, Duoshan, Abudoukelimu, Mamuti, representatives from the Shanghai branch of the Islamic Association, including Haibin, Hiali, representatives from the Fudan Islamic Students Association, Fan Ruyu, Yu Zhiping, and more than ten representatives from the Seamen's Party Department, the Central Training Corps Shanghai branch, the Fine Arts Association, the Cultural Movement Committee, and the Chinese Academy of Music and Dance, all went to the station to welcome them, creating an unprecedentedly enthusiastic atmosphere.

At two forty-five, when the train entered the station, the audience rushed into the station, vying to catch a glimpse of the brilliance of the border stars. Their excitement was so overwhelming that order was disrupted, and the platform was packed with people. The song and dance troupe was unable to get off the train for a long time. At that moment, movie star Hu Die arrived at the station and was immediately surrounded by the crowd. All planned ceremonies could not be carried out. The Northwest Film Company originally planned to shoot a documentary, but the recording and photography equipment was pushed around by the crowd and could not be used.

Amidst the noise, Dai Ailian's nine-year-old daughter, Ye Meng, squeezed into the carriage, presented flowers to Kangbarhan, and attached a short letter from Su to the troupe, expressing the welcome of the city's song and dance community. Kang then pinned a carnation in Ye Meng's hair, and they smiled at each other with their arms around each other's necks, their hearts connected. Subsequently, the troupe broke through the crowd to the sound of military music, and went to the Youth Center on Huashan Road to rest. After arriving, Hu Die re-performed the flower presentation ceremony, and Kang accepted with a smile. The two members met in the same hall and shook hands warmly, creating a very pleasant atmosphere.

Kangbarhan, the flower of the Uyghur people, attracted the most attention from the crowd yesterday. Kang wore a "Toba" felt hat, with her braids hanging low, thick eyebrows and piercing eyes, red flowers in her temples, and large gold ornaments inlaid on her wrists and ears. She was robust, simple, agile, and graceful, and her profound artistic cultivation was evident in her humble and sincere demeanor. The other members of the troupe were also healthy and beautiful. Yesterday, Kangbarhan's young daughter and Director Aisha's young son came to Shanghai on the same train. They could already speak Mandarin and were very excited about the frenzied welcome.

To Perform More Than Forty Types of Dance Programs

According to Mr. He Guangli, the Xinjiang Provincial Government Councilor who accompanied the visiting troupe, he told reporters, "The purpose of this song and dance troupe's visit is to express the culture of the border ethnic groups and to observe the arts of the mainland. It is not for profit. The current plan is to stay in Shanghai for a month. If time permits, they may go to other parts of Jiangsu and Zhejiang. The song and dance troupe has prepared forty dance programs, some of which have been performed in Beijing, but the rest have not been performed in the mainland and may refresh the audience."

[Another report] Yesterday, when the Xinjiang Youth Song and Dance Visiting Troupe arrived at the Youth Center on Huashan Road by train from the North Station, reporters from various newspapers competed to capture this precious moment when Hu Die presented flowers to Kangbarhan. However, He Feiguang, director of Northwest Film Company, blocked the camera with his body and said sternly, "What are you filming?" Later, when reporters from various newspapers went upstairs to interview, they were also firmly rejected by the reception staff, which aroused the indignation of all the reporters. The order was chaotic yesterday, and the audience and reporters were squeezed beyond recognition. It is hoped that the reception staff will pay attention to improvements in the future, and carefully arrange in advance to avoid being unable to maintain order.

### Year-End Bonus Issue Three Hours of Heated Debate Labor and Management Representatives Express Their Hardships Research Committee to Re-discuss

[Report from our newspaper] The Social Bureau's Year-End Bonus Research Committee invited representatives from the Industrial Association, the City Chamber of Commerce, and the General Labor Union to hold a symposium at the Social Bureau's conference room at 3 pm yesterday to seek opinions. Chairman Lu Jingshi elaborated on the significance and process of establishing the Year-End Bonus Research Committee and reported on last year's year-end bonus method, and then invited representatives from all attendees to express their opinions. Wang Xianqing, a representative of the City Chamber of Commerce, first stated that the year-end bonus method set by the government last year was very fair and was successfully implemented. He hoped that the government would use this policy to achieve a satisfactory result for this year's year-end bonus. Shui Xiangyunyan, representing the labor sector, spoke, hoping for two points: The minimum year-end bonus for this year should not be less than one month, but it should be scaled according to the prosperity and decline of various industries. Temporary workers and piece-rate workers should also receive year-end bonuses. Jin Runxiang of the Chamber of Commerce hoped that there would be no rigid regulations for universal rewards. Xia Enlin of Fangjian Company said: This year, all yarn factories have not made money, and it is hoped that the year-end bonus can be lower than last year. Moreover, the total number of year-end bonuses for all industries in the city is huge, and the year-end credit is tight. It is imperative for the National Bank to issue more large notes to cope with it. The consequences are worth considering. Pan Shihao of the City Chamber of Commerce stated that this year's industry and commerce is extremely difficult and it is feared that they cannot afford the year-end bonus. Zhang Zhusan of the General Labor Union believes that workers are living in hardship. The living index for November is 53,100 times, which needs to be calculated with a discount, while the price index has reached more than 84,000 times. The year-end bonus is the hope of workers for the year. If it is not properly resolved, the problem will be serious. Zhou Xuexiang believes that the saying that year-end bonuses stimulate prices is not true. Capitalists have difficulties, and workers also have difficulties. It is hoped that this year's year-end bonus can be based on last year with one month as the principle. If there are difficulties, labor and management can openly discuss and negotiate. Xie Fukang of the Industrial Association said that in order to avoid situations such as last year's strikes, even if they can afford the year-end bonus, they also hope to issue it in a stable manner. Other speakers included Liang Yongzhang, Liu Qingyi, Liu Jingji, Li Kaidi, and others. After three hours of heated debate, Chairman Lu Jingshi summarized the opinions of all parties into three points: We must consider the actual situation and be realistic. During this period of mobilizing to suppress the rebellion, the year-end bonus issue should be resolved reasonably and legally, and how to prevent the year-end bonus from stimulating prices. At the same time, in terms of public security, attention should be paid to preventing it from being used by the Communist Party or other unfortunate events from occurring. In addition, efforts should be made to resolve year-end bonus disputes quickly. If the Social Bureau cannot resolve it, it will be sent to the Evaluation Committee for processing. The difficulties of both labor and management are all facts. This responsibility cannot be borne by the government. We should recognize the goal and be entirely caused by the Communist Party.

Lu Jingshi concluded by saying: The task of the Research Committee is to study methods and provide them for the government's reference when making decisions. After seeking opinions from all parties this time, the Research Committee will hold a meeting to discuss them. It is not convenient to announce it before the meeting is held or even if a method has been decided but has not been submitted to Mayor Wu for approval. However, Lu assured the representatives from the General Labor Union, the Industrial Association, and the City Chamber of Commerce that he was responsible for drafting a method in a very short period of time and providing it to the government for a decision as soon as possible. The symposium did not end until after 6 pm.

### Coal Gas Consumption Reaches Peak Municipal Public Utilities Bureau Discusses Countermeasures Decides to Adopt the Principle of Average Distribution Electric Power for Schools Decided to be Given Preference

[Report from our newspaper] According to Zhao Zengjue, director of the Public Utilities Bureau, he told reporters yesterday that the city's coal gas consumption has reached its peak. Due to the recent cold weather, the consumption of various users has increased. If this continues, the supply of coal gas may become a problem. Moreover, the city's gas plants have decided to carry out repairs simultaneously in the coming spring, which may slightly affect the coal gas supply. To this end, the Public Utilities Bureau specially invited relevant parties to discuss countermeasures yesterday, and resolved that all users applying for coal gas should strive for the principle of average distribution. From now on, the user's application form should be sent to the Public Utilities Bureau for review, and the bureau will implement average distribution based on its consumption.

In addition, the Public Utilities Bureau convened a power supply review committee at 3 pm yesterday, and the following resolutions were made on the application of various schools in the city to the Public Utilities Bureau for preferential electricity use: In the past, the applications of various schools in the city to increase the amount of electricity used were all in the name of the school principal, so the Public Utilities Bureau regarded them as ordinary private electricity use applications and did not approve them. In the future, schools applying should use the name of the school, and the Public Utilities Bureau can find a way as soon as possible. The standard for school electricity use is determined to be calculated at 80% of the highest amount in the three months of March, April, and May of this year to give preferential treatment. If schools still have difficulties, they can report them truthfully, and the Public Utilities Bureau will increase them appropriately according to actual needs.

### Chen Chunpu Spared from Death Penalty, Resentenced to Life Imprisonment; Remained Calm and Expressionless While Hearing the Verdict

[Our Own Correspondent] Chen Chunpu, who formerly served as the Secretary-General of the puppet Executive Yuan, puppet Minister of Construction, puppet Minister of Organization of the puppet Central Party Headquarters, puppet Governor of Guangdong Province, and Director of the Guangdong Pacification Headquarters, was previously sentenced to death by the High Court. Chen refused to accept the verdict and filed an appeal for retrial to the Supreme Court, which remanded the case for further review. Yesterday morning at 9:30 AM, the High Court, presided over by Judge Liu Yugui, commuted his death sentence to life imprisonment. The verdict stated: "Chen Chunpu, having colluded with an enemy state and plotted to resist this country, is sentenced to life imprisonment, deprived of civil rights for life, and all property, except for what is deemed necessary to support his family, is to be confiscated." Yesterday, Chen was still wearing a blue cloth robe, had short graying hair, wore glasses on his nose, and wore black straight-grain woolen, shallow round-mouth shoes. He remained calm while hearing the verdict and showed no sign of joy, as if he had already anticipated the outcome.

Four Reasons for Reducing the Sentence

The reasons for reducing the sentence are roughly as follows: Although Chen held important positions in the puppet government, the motive for his participation in the puppet Wang Jingwei regime stemmed from escorting Wang's children to Hong Kong for their studies, as evidenced by Mr. Chen's own letter. This differs from those who intentionally defected to the puppet regime. During his tenure in the puppet Guangdong Provincial Government, Chen achieved definite results in implementing anti-smoking and anti-drug measures. Evidence includes reports from the enemy regarding the puppet Guangdong Provincial Government's anti-smoking efforts, a signed report from the puppet Finance Department regarding the implementation of anti-drug and anti-smoking measures, Guangdong Provincial Government's anti-drug and anti-smoking document archives, and various books and newspapers documenting the "Situation of Eradicating Opium Seedlings in Guangdong." This point was significantly beneficial to the people's health. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs was consulted regarding the "Sino-Japanese Basic Treaty" and other humiliating treaties concluded by the puppet government. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs replied that the defendant's name was not found to be involved. The Guangdong High Court Prosecutor's Office and the two High Courts stated that the defendant had not engaged in any behavior unfavorable to the people in Guangdong. Based on the facts investigated above, while not entitling him to complete acquittal, when weighing the gravity of the crimes, it is not impossible to spare him from the death penalty. Therefore, within the legally prescribed punishment, the sentence is changed to life imprisonment. Based on the above conclusions, according to Article 1, Article 2, Section 1, Item 1, Article 8, Section 1, and Article 9 of the Regulations for Punishing Traitors, Article 2, Section 1, Paragraph 1, and Article 37, Section 1 of the Criminal Code, the verdict is as stated in the main text.

### Land Prosecutor's Office Orders Review of Case Files for Lu Wenying's Drug Trafficking

### Case of Ma Shurong's Supplying the Enemy Concluded

[Our Own Correspondent] The case of Ma Shurong, General Manager of Zhenhua Timber Company, accused of serving as "Director of the Japan-China Timber Industry Association" and forcibly requisitioning timber in this city to supply the enemy, was concluded yesterday in the High Court. The verdict will be announced at 10:00 AM on the 10th of this month. Ma denied colluding with the enemy and claimed to be an underground worker who had participated in the Anti-Japanese Traitor Elimination Corps. Judge Liu questioned him, "If you are a member of the Anti-Japanese Traitor Elimination Corps, why is it that the person who reported you is also a person in charge of the Anti-Japanese Traitor Elimination Corps?" Ma was speechless.

### Barge Freight Rates Automatically Adjusted: Loading and Unloading Rates Increase by 10%; Decision Passed by Port Affairs Consolidation Committee

[Our Own Correspondent] The Shanghai Port Affairs Consolidation Committee held its 42nd meeting yesterday in the City Government Conference Room. The resolutions are as follows: (A) The automatic adjustment method for barge freight rates is approved as follows: For boatmen's wages, the wages approved in July will be used as the base. Each time the freight rates are adjusted, they will be increased or decreased proportionally according to the cost of living index. Regarding the automatic adjustment calculation formula for barging fees, the boatmen's wage portion should be revised according to the first point of the resolution. In the future, freight rates may be adjusted once a month, but if the increase or decrease is less than 20 percent, no adjustment may be made. In the future, when adjusting freight rates according to this automatic adjustment calculation formula, the guild should first prepare a detailed report according to the formula and submit it to the Public Utilities Bureau for approval before implementation. (B) Regarding the request from the Municipal Wharf Commercial Guild to adjust labor prices, the following three resolutions were made: Loading and unloading rates will be increased by 50 percent. The payment of wages to workers at each wharf should be related to the R.S.D. (presumably, Rate Standardization Division), and the Wharf Industry Guild should draft measures within half a month and submit them to the Public Utilities Bureau to convene the Loading and Unloading Rate Review Committee for review. The berthing fees collected by each wharf should be clearly stated on the loading and unloading labor fee receipts issued to the cargo owners to avoid confusion with sticking fees. (C) A proposal by the Inspection and Security Team to require merchants to issue guarantee letters for goods transported to Dinghai, Chongming, and Shazikou, was approved in principle. The Customs will work with the Inspection Team to draft detailed implementation measures.

### On the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Border Line

[Our Own Correspondent's Speedy Dispatch from Shangrao, 2nd] Departing Jinhua by train, we arrived at the Jinhua River Bridge. This bridge was destroyed by enemy artillery fire, and is now being rebuilt. However, because the import of steel is difficult, it has been rebuilt using a wooden arch frame created by domestic engineers. The bridge is 282.954 meters long. I asked Mr. Hou Jiayuan, director of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Bureau, who was traveling with me, how many years this bridge could last. He said: It can last at least five years. If it is inspected regularly and decaying wooden planks are replaced, it can last for a considerable period of time. Continuing forward, we arrived at Lingshan Port, which is within the territory of Longyou. There is also a large bridge at Lingshan Port, built using wooden trusses invented by foreigners. These wooden trusses are connected by steel rings, making them extremely strong. I saw several rows of bamboo rafts on Lingshan Port. Boatmen were wading through the water, dragging the bamboo rafts across the shallows. I asked them where they came from. They said they had come to the city yesterday to sell "yellow paper." It turned out that this place produces paper used for burning to ghosts and deities, which is sold in the Subei area.

The Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway's History Has Been Full of Twists and Turns

While in the train, Mr. Hou Jiayuan told us the history of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway: "In the 16th year of the Republic (1927), the Zhejiang Provincial Government surveyed Tonglu and built the Guanxi Railway Line. However, it cost 150,000 yuan per mile. Later, with a grant of 300,000 yuan, they resolutely wanted to build the railway. Because they did not obtain central government approval to build a railway, they changed it to the Xiaoshan-Changshan Highway. Zhejiang Province then used its own financial resources to rebuild the Xiaoshan-Changshan Light Railway. Because standard steel rails were expensive, light rails were cheaper. At that time, Germany was promoting foreign trade, so it sold light rails to Zhejiang Province on credit. Thus, a standard gauge and light railway were built. Because the Quzhou-Changshan project was difficult to do, it was changed to Jiangshan, and thus named the Hangzhou-Jiang Railway, which is now the roadbed of the Zhejiang section of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway. However, at that time, the section between Xiaoshan and Zhuji was being converted from a highway to a railway, so there were many curved paths, which is still the case today. Later, Zhejiang Province issued construction bonds, sold the Hangzhou Power Plant, and built the railway to Lanxi. In the 20th year of the Republic (1931), they borrowed money from the British Boxer Indemnity Fund to buy steel rails, and in the 21st year of the Republic (1932), they borrowed money from construction bonds to complete the section to Wangshan. In the 22nd year of the Republic (1933), the Fujian Incident occurred, and the central government relied on this railway to quickly put down the incident, thus emphasizing the importance of this railway. This prompted the Ministry of Railways to allocate a portion of the construction bonds it issued to build it. Jiangxi also issued construction bonds. Zhang Gongquan also introduced a loan from Germany for steel rails, guaranteed by the Bank of China, so that the Yushan section could be completed with heavy rails and renamed the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway. After 18 months of work, it was opened to traffic in Nanchang in January of the 25th year of the Republic (1936), and in August of the 26th year of the Republic (1937), it was opened to traffic to Pingxiang. The section from Zhuzhou to Pingxiang was also handed over to the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway for management.

Full Line to Open to Traffic Next Autumn

With the railway completed, the War of Resistance broke out, and military transport was frequent. It was originally planned to replace the heavy rails on the section from Hangzhou to Wangshan, but when the War of Resistance began, the section from Hangzhou to Zhuji was demolished first, then the section from Zhuji to Jinhua, then the section from Nanchang to Pingxiang, and finally the section from Zhuzhou to Pingxiang. The Japanese enemy, in order to transport Jiangxi grain, rebuilt the railway from Hangzhou to Jinhua, and before the victory, they dismantled the section to Zhuji again. Immediately after this dismantling, the Japanese surrendered and only the section from Hangzhou to Zhuji was not dismantled. Before the victory, the Third War Zone had requested military traffic between Shangrao and Quzhou. At the time of the Japanese surrender the sections between Quzhou and Shangrao and between Hangzhou and Zhuji were opened to traffic, but the sections between Zhuji and Jinhua, between Jinhua and Quzhou and between Quzhou and Shangrao were difficult to restore due to the excessive number of bridges. Now our department is striving with all its strength to achieve full line operation. It can be said that we will be able to get through to Nanchang by the end of next month or the beginning of January, and the full line will be open to traffic in August or September of next year.” We understand that this difficult Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway is truly a valuable page in the history of the engineering world. We believe that the more difficult it is, the stronger it will become, and it will surely have a different kind of brilliance under a thousand hammers and refinements.

Two Statues Carved in Three Years at Lu's Tomb

While we were talking, we arrived in Yuzhou. While the car was stopped briefly, it let us enter the city for a visit. We arrived at the official residence of the Confucius Officiant, and requested the Kong family to bring out the Confucius statue for viewing. They immediately brought it out. Confucius and his wife were both carved from wood, each statue five inches wide and one foot three inches long. According to the old lady of the Kong family, "As far back as the Southern Song Dynasty, Duan Yougong, a direct descendant of the 46th generation, brought these two statues from Qufu when he crossed south. These statues were made of *kaimu* wood. There is *kaimu* wood between the tombs of Confucius. In those days, Zigong guarded the tomb for three years, and carved these statues from *kaimu* wood. The Kong family is now in the 75th generation. The Officiant is Kong Fanhao. After Fanhao's death, his younger brother Fan Ying's son Xiangkai inherited the position." She told us that the Kong family in Qufu, Shandong, wanted them to return, but because they had lived here for several generations, and in the situation of "preferring relatives over honor," they were willing to stay where they were. As for the current Officiant, before the war, his salary was 430 yuan per month. As for who is the direct descendant between him and the one in Qufu now, this can only be decided and verified by studying the Kong family tree and the research of archaeologists.

Yuzhou has several uneven roads. The Pacification Headquarters is located here, and there are quite a few shops. The local produce is oranges and winter bamboo shoots. Oranges cost 1,000 yuan each, and winter bamboo shoots cost 16,000 yuan per catty.

The Land Is Barren and the Population Is Increasingly Sparse

Returning to the station, we boarded the train to continue our journey. The pine trees on both sides of the land are about to become a forest, which is pleasing to the eye. However, in many places, there is no one cultivating the land. Once we entered the territory of Jiangxi, it became even more apparent that there was more wasteland and a sparser population. When the train arrived in Shangrao, the platform was woven into a shed with bamboo leaves and bamboo strips, which can also be said to be a difficult undertaking. This place produces jujubes, pears, rice, oil, etc. A large amount of goods were piled up at the station. According to transportation personnel, 3,000 tons of goods travel on the road between Hangzhou and Shangrao every day.

The train continued forward, revealing a more desolate scene. The mountains on both sides undulated. Passing Jieyan Mountain, we saw a giant cave running through the mountains, looking much like an elephant's trunk. When the train arrived at Fenglingtou, we got off to see the coal mine at Kangkou. This coal seam extends from Shangrao in the west to Hengfeng, with reserves of 200 million tons. The mine is excavated manually, producing about 30 tons of bituminous coal per day, and 1,000 tons per month. There are more than 600 workers. There is a light railway between the mine and the railway, but the coal is transported by manpower pushing carts.

Industrial Power Quickly Recovering

It is said that the Pingxiang coal mine produced 3,000 tons of coal per day before the war, but now it only produces 3,000 tons per month. In order to revitalize Zhejiang's industry, coal is extremely important. We hope that idle capital will be invested here to quickly develop and restore the raw materials for this industrial power.

Boarding the train again, we arrived at Bingfeng Station, which is in the county. Because of the years of war and chaos, there are only a hundred households in the county town. The local produce is rice, but after all, because the land is vast and the population is sparse, there is not a large output. Proceeding further, we arrived at Yiyang Station, which is two kilometers from the county town. I asked a passerby how many people there were in the county. They replied that there were only two or three hundred households. The local produce is also rice.

Compared to Zhejiang and Jiangxi, Zhejiang can naturally be considered to be relatively well-off. Jiangxi, especially the places we passed through, the scene after the disaster, is nakedly presented before your eyes, causing you to think of the disaster of that year. At the same time, it inspires a fervent admiration for those who are now working hard to rebuild. (Special Correspondent Chu Yusheng)

### Discovery of "Xiantian Dao" Den in Wuxi Huishan Wenchang Pavilion; Buddhist Hall Used as Cover for Resurgence; Secrets Leaked Due to Discord Between Master and Disciples

[Report from Our Wuxi Bureau, 2nd] During the period of enemy occupation in Xiyi (Wuxi), the "Xiantian Dao" (Way of Former Heaven) cult was discovered in the four rural districts. It used claims of invulnerability to knives and guns to deceive the ignorant masses. For a time, hundreds of thousands of people blindly followed it. Later, the enemy army shot and killed Jiang Mingbi, a man from Anhui who claimed to be the leader of the "Xiantian Dao," and the cult disappeared. Since the victory, however, the cult has shown signs of resurgence. The authorities have repeatedly issued strict orders to ban it in various places. Recently, the county police bureau received a tip-off that Ma Zhengrun, an old Taoist priest at the Wenchang Pavilion in Huishan, was the leader of the Xiantian Dao cult. He usually spread rumors to confuse the public and was suspected of instigating illegal activities such as robbery and abduction of women. Upon receiving the report, the police bureau ordered the criminal investigation team to go to the address yesterday and arrest the suspect, who confessed to being the leader of the Xiantian Dao without hesitation.

A Grand Title

The suspect, Ma, is 54 years old and originally from Jingjiang. He has resided in the Fudetan (Assisting Virtue Altar) at Daixi Bridge in Wujin for a long time. Since the 29th year of the Republic of China (1940), Ma has been using the Wenchang Pavilion in Huishan to promote Buddhism and performing rituals as a cover for his evil activities. He has misled the ignorant masses, who flocked to him, and the incense was flourishing, shining brightly along with the Buddhist hall set up by the famous Three Old Ladies on a nearby mountain. He usually pretended to teach Buddhist scriptures and recruited young women to live in the hall. Over the years, he has established a foundation in the local area, organized groups, and called himself "Director of Propaganda for the Wuxi Kangjian (Health) Society," "Director of the Xiantian Buddhist Gate Persuasion Society," "Director of the Huishan Geliu (Lane) Association," "Chief Supervisor of the Huishan Buddhist Health Association," and "Instructor and Manager of the Zhonghua (China) Buddhist Society." He had various titles and numerous designations, and also used aliases such as Ma Zhengxiang, Ma Zhengren, Ma Yuting, and also styled himself Defeng (Virtue Wind). When Ma preached in Houteng, Jiangyin, he was given the honorable title of "Ma Changxian" (Flourishing Virtue of Ma) by the local community, demonstrating his influence.

Flower-Picking Master

In September of this year, the Jiangyin County government arrested a robber named Zhu Zhangsheng, who was a local murderer and expert in abducting women. It turned out that he was also a disciple of Ma. At that time, letters addressed to Ma's two mistresses in Wuxi were found on Zhu. One was a female cultivator in Ma's Buddhist hall, who was of marriageable age, and the other was a nun. The letters not only revealed the intimate relationship between Zhu and the two women, but also involved Ma's adulterous affairs. In a letter to Yulian, he wrote: "She is a wealthy lady. Ma Changxian is a flower-picking master and would do such shameless things. I was in Houcheng and saw his every move, and it was exactly as I suspected. Later, I heard in Chenggougang that you and Lingmei had also suffered from his actions. Also, a monk in the Jingjie (Respecting Chastity) Hall in Xiyangqiao told me that he had also harassed them. This is the true feeling of a Taoist friend of Taibai who confesses without being forced." In a letter to Ruiqin, he wrote: "I lightly stepped into your esteemed hall, and I am deeply grateful for your love and affection, which has left a mark on my spine… You are also a clever intellectual, but you probably understand that Ma is a slippery character. Miss, why does Ma Changxian often come to your hall, and he is a Taoist friend who picks flowers." Ma's affairs with the two women were fully revealed on paper.

Resurrection of the Dead

Recently, Ma used a large sum of 600 shi (about 60,000 kg) of white rice to build another Buddhist hall on the side of the mountain. He has already paid 100 shi for materials, and is raising the remaining funds from the nearby villagers. However, he was reported and arrested. The criminal investigation team seized propaganda materials of the Xiantian Dao called "Bitter Sea Compassionate Voyage" and "Thunder Gate Ascending to Heaven Scripture." When asked about their meaning, he claimed that they were to encourage people to do good deeds. In the Thunder Gate Ascending to Heaven Scripture, there was also a "method for understanding the resurrection of the dead." The text read: "When a person dies, do not cry. Quickly find a quiet place and have someone watch over them until twelve o'clock without speaking. Gently call out with joy and wash the face with cold water." When asked if the dead could be resurrected, he claimed he did not know. When asked to explain the meaning of the two characters "Xiantian" (Former Heaven), he said, "It is said in the medical books about the theory of Xiantian and Houtian (Later Heaven). We understood it ourselves and used the name Xiantian." Ma has a vulgar and wretched appearance. He wears a felt hat and a homespun cloth garment, looking like a country bumpkin. He murmurs Buddhist chants in his mouth. The criminal investigation team has already presented Ma to the headquarters for interrogation last night. If he is found to be a demon engaging in activities under a false name, he will be sent to the military law office of the county government for strict punishment.

### Regulations on Academic and Written Examination Rewards for Civil Servants Established by the Executive Yuan; Full Text of Six Articles Has Been Communicated to the Ministry of Education

[Report from Our Nanjing Bureau, 3rd] The Ministry of Education has received an order from the Executive Yuan regarding the six articles of the Regulations on Academic and Written Examination Rewards for Civil Servants. The main points are as follows: The Examination Yuan has specially formulated reward measures to improve the effectiveness of academic and written examinations for civil servants. Those who achieve a first-class or higher ranking in the examinations will be exempted from the corresponding subjects when participating in higher or ordinary qualification examinations. At the end of the year, the service unit's performance evaluation committee will increase the academic score of the examinee based on the following grades, but the total academic score after the increase shall not exceed the statutory maximum academic score. If the examinee's service unit fails to increase the academic score, the Ministry of Personnel will notify the original service unit to provide the increase. (A) Super-grade: 5 points; (B) Special grade: 4 points; (C) First grade: 3 points. The increased academic score should be specified in the remarks column of the performance evaluation form. If the increase in academic score results in the examinee being ranked first-class, causing the number of personnel ranked first-class to exceed the limit stipulated in Article 5, Paragraph 2 of the Civil Servant Performance Evaluation Regulations, the head of the service unit should reduce the score of the personnel with the lower total score. If the total scores are the same, the academic score of the personnel with the lower academic score should be reduced. If the total scores of the examinee and other personnel are the same, the head of the unit should rank the examinee higher when determining the ranking. After the results of the annual academic and written examinations are announced, the Examination Committee should send the grade results of the examinees from each unit to the respective service units for processing in accordance with Articles 3 and 4 of these regulations. It should also prepare a general roster of the examinees from each unit, detailing the rank and grade of the examinee's position in the service unit, and submit it to the Ministry of Personnel for registration.

[Report from Our Taiyuan Bureau, 2nd] Professors at Shanxi University hosted reporters at 2:00 PM on the 2nd and issued a declaration. The words were sad and sincere. The declaration included: "Prices are soaring, which is the case throughout the country. The situation in Taiyuan is particularly severe. Not to mention goods from other places, flour has risen to 1.1 million yuan, which is more than twice the price in Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, and other places. The salary income is not enough to feed a family of three. We have repeatedly requested the precedent of allocations in Tianjin and other universities, but have not been granted. Under the pressure of the situation, the entire faculty has resolved to collectively request leave starting from the 1st. Although we are willing to teach, we cannot bear the hunger and cold. If we can get enough to eat, who would be willing to beg for a few dou (pecks) of rice? Although the students' classes will be suspended during the leave period, we are still willing to provide guidance at any time to prevent them from being wasted."

### Zhonghua Xueyi (Arts and Sciences) Society Held Annual Meeting Yesterday; Resolved to Strengthen Japanese Studies; and Actively Promote Electrified Education

[Report from Our Bureau] The Zhonghua Xueyi Society held its 30th-anniversary celebration yesterday. Branches across the country held celebrations in nine districts simultaneously. The first postwar annual meeting of the Beijing-Shanghai-Hangzhou District was held at the society's address on Shaoxing Road in the city yesterday morning. Seventy members including Luo Zonglu and Li Yutian attended. Representatives from various branches also participated. Chairman Cheng Shizhen said in his speech that when the Zhonghua Xueyi Society was first founded in Japan, there were only a few dozen members. Since then, it has grown to more than 2,200 members. Today, on the 30th anniversary, the country is divided into nine districts, and celebrations are held on the same day. We should silently remember the hard work of the late Director He Bingsong in founding the society. (There was a three-minute silence). He then put forward three points: Each should use his expertise to develop research capabilities; As the Society was founded in Japan, we should conduct special research on Japanese issues; Our country should follow the path of democracy and peace and take on the mission of promoting East Asian culture. Then, Director Zhou Shouchang reported on the preparations for the annual meeting. Li Ximou, the acting director of the Education Bureau, said in his speech that the establishment of world academic institutions often starts with the efforts of private groups and then becomes national academic institutions, such as the Royal Society of the United Kingdom. He hoped that the Zhonghua Xueyi Society would devote more effort to promoting academic research. Ren Hongjun, the representative of the Zhonghua Natural Science Society, said in his speech that when the Zhonghua Xueyi Society was first established in Japan, many Chinese students in Japan were active in politics and ideology. Later, they realized that academics were more important and engaged in scientific research. Zhang Jusheng, an honorary member of the Society, delivered a speech with painful words. He said that Japan's construction in Taiwan and Northeast China over the past decades has achieved amazing results, but after our country took over, we failed to utilize them and allowed them to be abandoned and destroyed. In the future, we should be vigilant and seek academic self-reliance. Then, representatives from various branches and the Society's Secretary-General Li Yutian reported on the Society's affairs and the tasks of the annual meeting. The meeting adjourned at 12:00 noon. All members attended a luncheon hosted by Mayor Wu, who delivered a speech and expressed his admiration for the Society's emphasis on both science and morality. The general meeting was resumed at 2:00 PM in the afternoon, presided over by Luo Zonglu, who announced eight papers. Gao Zhongqin demonstrated the Chinese electric typewriter. Mr. Gao said that he has now manufactured four typewriters at a cost of 400,000 US dollars. If mass production is possible, the cost can be reduced. The training time for Chinese typists is six months, which is the same as the time required to learn English typing. Then, the discussion of the proposals began and the following were passed: Hiring special researchers; Holding academic lectures; Actively promoting electrified education; Strengthening Japanese studies; Raising funds; Revising the Society's charter, to be handled by the board of directors. At 7:00 PM, there was a dinner, as well as performances such as Ouyang Yuqian's "Extra Performance" and movies.

### Malayan Chinese Achieves Opening Success in the Philippines

Big Win Against Manila, Then Victory Against Philippines United Team

[United Press, Manila, 3rd] The Lianhua Team, the strong Malayan Overseas Chinese football team, played against the Manila Team here on the 2nd. The Lianhua Team easily defeated the Philippine team 6-0. For the first 25 minutes after the start of the game, both sides played cautiously and achieved nothing.

Three minutes later, Xie Wenliang received a pass from the left wing and scored another goal. Then, right forward Huang Guo added icing on the cake and scored two more goals. The visiting team defended with all its strength in the second half. Ten minutes later, left forward Hu Wenxiang scored a goal. Five minutes later, Hu scored another goal, winning the game 6-0.

### Analysis of Shantou Team's Victory: Unleashing the Peak Era Speed

[Special dispatch from this newspaper] Last night at the Municipal Gymnasium, over two thousand fans watched intently a rare, exciting, and intense basketball game. The score was also unprecedentedly high.

The Oil Team endured great hardship to win the final victory. Through the entire fierce battle, there was a deeper understanding of the strength of the American military's Topeka team. The American team aimed to exchange skills and did not focus on winning or losing. In the first half, the score was 22 to 23. The American team's elite players were replaced by entirely new forces, resulting in a loss of six or seven points. The inability to catch up in the second half was one of the reasons for Topeka's defeat last night.

Given that the China United team defeated the Topeka team by three points last week, and that Da Li did not participate in that game, the Shantou team gained some confidence psychologically. The change in strategy, unleashing the peak era's combat speed, was truly the only condition for the Shantou team's victory. In the first half, Chen Qingjiang's lively scoring entirely depended on fast dribbling, thus leading from afar. In the second half, Chen Qingjiang was exhausted and injured, and Ji Nankang replaced him, greatly reducing the team's speed. If it weren't for Lin Weiting's forty-five-degree mid-range sharpshooting, the Topeka team would undoubtedly have surpassed them. Cai Yanxiong's command of the offense, and Ma Zai and Li De's defense, all exerted their greatest effort.

For the Topeka team, Meyer and Hui Pei were still the best, and Pei Han also had a better performance than last week. Black player Bowser only focused on offense and ignored defense last night, allowing Chen Qingjiang to repeatedly receive passes and score with ease. Of course, the merits did not outweigh the demerits.

Comparing Lato of Topeka with "Columbus," who came to Shanghai this spring, the former appeared weaker, while Columbus's center, Ash, was more agile, which Meyer could not match. (Chang Nian)

Final Half Minute Decides the Outcome: Shantou Team Wins by One Point Against the American Military Team: Topeka Loses 72 to 73

[Report from this newspaper] A spirited and tense basketball friendly match was held at the Municipal Gymnasium at seven o'clock last night. The Shantou team defeated the American Navy's Topeka team by one point. There were over two thousand spectators. In the first half, Shantou team's Chen Qingjiang scored 19 points alone. Meyer was the most dynamic player for the Topeka team. Initially, the Shantou team seemed to have difficulty coordinating due to excessive nervousness. The team only found its normal state after five minutes. After that, the Shantou team took the advantage and led in score. The first half score was 36 to 29. The second half became even more intense. The Shantou team fought hard and ultimately won by a precious one point, 73 to 72, against the Topeka team. The game situation was as follows:

First Half

At the beginning of the game, Shantou team's Cai Yanxiong was noticeably shorter than Meyer. Within a second, Topeka's Pei Han scored, showing off his skills. Shantou team's attempted shot missed, but the ball was seen hovering on the hoop. Li De and Wei Ting fought hard, narrowing the score to 7 to 4. The sailors made major personnel adjustments, tying the score at 11 points. Both sides displayed excellent shooting skills. The Shantou team led by two points at 17 to 15. The situation changed, and the Shantou team exceeded by one point again at 23 to 22. The sailors then made a complete change of personnel. The Shantou team maintained its advantage. The Shantou team led with 36 to 29 in the first half.

Second Half

The Topeka team had many substitute players. In the second half, they still fought with the same five players, waiting at ease. The sailors quickly caught up, tying the score at 40 points. At 46 to 41, Lin Weiting replaced Chen Qingjiang, and the score became 55 to 55 again. The Shantou team took the lead at 61 to 51, and the audience cheered. The foreign team substituted four players, tying the score again at 62 to 71. Lin Weiting shot from long distance, exceeding the score to 73 to 71. Cai committed a foul and was replaced by He Lide. Topeka's Meyer scored a free throw. As the clock rang, the score was 73 to 72, with the Shantou team winning by only one point.

### President Zhang of the Central Bank Discusses the Mission of the Financial Administration

Emphasizing the Review of Commercial Bank Loans

[Report from this newspaper] When this reporter inquired about the establishment of the Financial Administration, President Zhang of the Central Bank replied: The Financial Administration's duties are broadly twofold. On the positive side, it assists various industries and businesses in obtaining legitimate working capital. For example, it supports cotton mills in purchasing raw cotton, weaving factories in purchasing cotton yarn, and other industries in purchasing raw materials, so that they can promptly engage in production and lower product prices, thus effectively reducing the burden on consumers. On the negative side, it prevents funds from being used for hoarding or speculation, so that goods are not exploited layer by layer, unreasonably raising prices and increasing the burden on consumers. During wartime, all bank loans in the United States and Britain had to be reviewed by the national banks of both countries, such as the Federal Reserve Bank and the Bank of England, for this very reason. It is hoped that the Financial Administration will carry out this important task with the most fair and reasonable spirit. He also said: Loans from national banks will be difficult to restore before the market stabilizes. The Financial Administration focuses on reviewing loans to commercial banks and companies.

### Li Lixia Summoned to Beijing

[Report from this newspaper] After the candidates for the director and deputy director of the Shanghai Financial Administration were finalized in Nanjing by telegraph, with Li Lixia and Bi Delin being internally appointed, this reporter met with Mr. Li yesterday.

He said: He was summoned to Beijing by telegram from the Ministry of Finance today (the 3rd), and is scheduled to go to Beijing tonight (the 2nd), and will return to Shanghai in a day or two, at which time there will be a formal new statement. According to reports, Mr. Li is currently the director of the Audit Department of the Central Bank, and the deputy director, Bi Delin, is currently an assistant in the Currency Department of the Ministry of Finance.

### Comprehensive Control of Cotton Yarn and Cloth; Silk and Weaving Association Reportedly to be Abolished; New Organizational Regulations Currently Being Drafted

[Report from this newspaper] The principle of comprehensive control of cotton yarn and cloth has been approved by the central authorities. It is reported that the Textile Industry Adjustment Committee will be abolished and a cotton yarn and cloth control agency will be established. Its organizational regulations, responsibilities, and control plans are currently being drafted in detail. The general principles are nothing more than the centralized procurement and allocation of raw cotton, and the complete entrusted spinning and weaving of cotton yarn and cloth, in order to rationalize the acquisition, distribution, production, transportation, sales, and supply of cotton yarn and cloth in three stages, and to achieve long-term stability in the price of cotton yarn and cloth. If the comprehensive control situation is realized, the pilot plan for joint distribution of cotton yarn, which has been discussed for a long time, will be virtually cancelled.

[Another report] Yuan Liang, chairman of the Silk and Weaving Association, has returned to Shanghai yesterday after completing his official duties in Beijing.

### Cotton Yarn Negotiated Prices Unchanged Yesterday

[Report from this newspaper] The negotiated price of cotton yarn at the Silk and Weaving Association remained unchanged yesterday, with 20-count yarn still maintaining the original price of 28.11 million yuan. Yesterday, Fangjian Company and the Silk and Weaving Association still sold yarn separately, all according to the purchase orders. Fangjian Company sold a total of 975 pieces, equivalent to 1,563 pieces of 20-count yarn, with a total of 319 purchase orders.

In addition, the Silk and Weaving Association sold yarn at the Yarn Merchants Association yesterday, selling a total of 1,934 pieces, equivalent to 2,190 pieces of 20-count yarn, with a total of 359 purchase orders. In total, 2,909 pieces of yarn were sold, equivalent to 3,753 pieces of 20-count yarn.

Coarse Yarn Prices Firm

Yesterday, in the cotton yarn market, the sales of fine yarn turned sluggish, and prices fell. Coarse yarn was firmer, but trading was very light. Only 20-count and 16-count coarse yarns sold slightly better, with robust demand from various regions. As a result, 42-count Lanfeng fine yarn dropped by 600,000 to 47.4 million yuan, 40-count yarn dropped by 900,000 to 1.15 million yuan, while coarse yarn prices rose slightly by 100,000 to 400,000 yuan.

Cloth Slightly Better

Yesterday, in the cotton cloth market, the local market absorbed some at the opening, and merchants also came to purchase. Later, due to unfavorable news, buyers were cautious, and off-market participants were rarely active, and the market appeared lackluster. As a result, 12-pound Longtou and other fine cloths improved by 5,000 to 22,000-23,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Serge, straight bleached cloth, and Shilin cloth were firmer, while other cloths were stable.

Spot Cotton Slightly Rises

Yesterday, the spot cotton market was mixed, with both rises and falls. Local cotton remained firm, but trading was limited. Lingbao stock delivery was trading at 4.547 million yuan, 70,000-80,000 yuan higher than the previous day. Shashi was at 4.63 million yuan, up 50,000 yuan, with 490 bales traded. Factory delivery was trading at 5.125 million yuan for Lingbin (arrears), with 100 bales traded. Stock delivery was trading at 4.63 million yuan for Shashi, 4.547 million yuan for sub-standard goods, 4.547 million yuan for Lingbin, 4.381 million yuan for Hanxi, 3.72 million yuan for Tongzhou, and 910,000 yuan for Zhoupu seed cotton, up 50,000 yuan.

### Rayon Prices Firm; Factory Transactions Sparse

Although rayon transactions were sparse, prices were firm. Yesterday, 120-count Asahi A grade glossy rayon opened at 96 million yuan, rose to 70 million yuan at noon, remained unchanged in the afternoon, and finally rose to 80 million yuan. 4A Peacock Globe glossy rayon was trading at around 89 million yuan.

Yesterday, factory sentiments were quite stable. Factories did not sell cheaply due to high costs, so transactions were very sparse. Asking prices at all levels were similar to the previous day, and prices for individual transactions were also similar to the previous day. Ordinary individual transactions were still priced at around 62 million yuan.

Yesterday, the silk market was slightly higher. Dasheng and Huaqiang silk bedding opened at around 9 million yuan and gradually rose. At the close, they were trading at 9.7 million yuan. In the afternoon, they were offered for sale at 30 million yuan. Dasheng checkered crepe remained at around 120,000 yuan. High-end Hua brocade crepe had transactions at 68,000 yuan. Other goods were stable as on the previous day.

Domestic Tea Firm

Yesterday, domestic tea sales continued in local shops and stores, and prices were consistently firm. As for the foreign tea market, English merchants resumed their focus on this year's Qimen black tea, and trading was acceptable, with little fluctuation in the market. As for green tea varieties, export firms were still hesitant due to the distant shipping dates, while sellers continued to defend prices, so the process was still characterized by scarce supply and demand, and transactions were sluggish, with the situation revolving.

### National Bank Discount and Loan Committee Approved Loan Amounts Last Month

[Report from this newspaper] The Discount and Loan Committee of the Central Bank released its loan statistics for November yesterday. The total number of loan applications approved for the month was 108, and the total amount of loans approved was 31.97 billion yuan, including one rediscount case with an amount of 50 million yuan, and 107 refinancing and mortgage cases with an amount of 31.92 billion yuan.

### National Bank Audit Department Intensifies Investigation of Returned Checks

The National Bank Audit Department is continuing its investigation of returned checks. In recent days, the department has sent personnel to the check clearing house, along with personnel stationed in Shanghai by the Ministry of Finance, to investigate the situation of returned checks. The reasons for the returned checks are being thoroughly investigated. If banks return checks due to their own lack of funds, they will be severely punished according to law.

### Unified Bonds and Foreign Shares Stable

Yesterday, public bonds were bought by foreign firms and Room 552, with some supply from Room 500. The process was mediocre and slightly stable, with minimal fluctuations. Unified Bond C opened in the morning at 22,700 yuan, reached a high of no more than 23,500 yuan, and lingered around 23,100 yuan at the close. The volume was no more than 4 million, with Unified Bonds A, B, D, and E each rising by 100-200 yuan compared to the previous close. Unified Bond C rose by 500 yuan.

Yesterday, foreign shares appeared stable, with local merchants buying and foreign merchants selling. Foreign commodity prices also appeared stable, and buying interest was still strong. However, paper and telephone shares were weaker. Yisha opened in the morning at 335,000 yuan, rose to 350,000 yuan in the forenoon and then consolidated. In the afternoon, the consolidation rose to 360,000 yuan at the close. As a result, Yisha, Shipping, English, and Hua each rose by half a percent compared to the previous close. Paper and Xiangtai fell by more than ten percent, telephone and tramway shares fell slightly, and the rest rose slightly.

### Buying Interest Slightly Active; Chinese Shares Initially Lower, Then Recovered

Yesterday, the news that Li Lixia would concurrently head the Shanghai Financial Administration stabilized various markets. The stock market also reflected this very well. Exchange at the National Bank was still not as tight as desired. Buyers gradually became active, initially lower, then recovered.

At the opening, Yongsasha was uniquely high, while the rest were flat. Yongsasha immediately traded at 357 yuan for immediate delivery and 360 yuan for forward delivery. After opening, No. 173 and others sold slightly, causing a slight decline to 355 yuan and 358 yuan. No. 103 and others bought cheap Yongsasha, and No. 84 and others bought spot Yongsasha, causing a rebound to a high of 364 yuan for immediate delivery and 367 yuan for forward delivery. No. 202 and others sold, and No. 155 sold immediate delivery. After the Guangdong merchants sold, sentiment turned weak again. Off-market interest rates opened at 22 cents and 27 original prices, and still fell to around 355 yuan, and spot declined. No. 56 and others sold again, still appearing weak. After 11 o'clock, No. 65 and others had bought up to 360 yuan. No. 224 and others came to close out, and at noon, they had fallen to a low of 352 yuan for immediate delivery and a low of 353 yuan for forward delivery. No. 117 was still maintaining, and spot and forward Yongsasha both closed at a price of 358 yuan. After the close, off-market bids rose again and recovered. As a result, compared to the previous close for immediate delivery shares, Neiyi rose by half a percent, Zhabei fell by half a percent, and Yongsasha, Yonggong, Zhongfang, Zhongs, Zhongni, Zhongxing, Xinya, and Wei rose slightly. Xinnuo, Huaxin, Xinguang, Jingfu, Qinxing, Sino-French, Xinhua, Rongfeng, Tongyi, and Guohuo fell slightly. Meiya, Match, and Jinglun were flat. Forward delivery shares saw Yongsasha rise slightly, Qinxing was flat, and the rest fell slightly.

After-market forward delivery was suspended as usual. After opening for immediate delivery Yongsasha, No. 207 and others sold from 362 yuan to 360 yuan. No. 65 and others came to buy. The exchange situation at the National Bank did not improve much. Prices had risen to 368 yuan. No. 224 and others sold, and it was rumored that a certain firm was unstable, falling back to 362 yuan. No. 220 and others still bought, and then closed at a price of 366 yuan. As a result, compared to the morning close, Zhabei Match recovered half a percent, Neiyi Jinglun was still flat, and the rest of the shares rose slightly. Off-market old shares generally showed some weakness and fatigue.

### Rice Turns from Weak to Firm; Coarse Grains and Oil Markets Rise Slightly

Yesterday, over 10,600 shi of rice and grains arrived in the north and south markets. Sales in stores were active, and market transactions were lively. The situation turned from weak to firm. Japonica and indica rice both recovered by more than 10,000 yuan, and early rice rose by more than 20,000 yuan. White yuan and yin yuan were sold as soon as they arrived, and prices did not fluctuate. Flour arrived continuously. Factories supplied as usual. Digestion was normal, and sentiment softened, falling by 3,000-5,000 yuan. The situation fluctuated and then entered a consolidation phase. There was not much bran in stock, and prices rose by 2,000-3,000 yuan.

Bean cake and oil residue were purchased in Taiwan, rising by 2,000-3,000 yuan. Local merchants were active in purchasing soybeans, and oil factories absorbed them at low prices. The market was stable. Soybean dregs were actively sold, rising by 10,000 yuan. Mung beans were still lackluster, with a slight recovery in weakness. Red beans were dull, red beans were still not traded, and soy beans were also lackluster.

Red sorghum rose completely by 3,000-5,000 yuan. Corn was re-adopted by the northern ocean, and the surge began again, soaring by 30,000-50,000 yuan. Sesame oil factories and local merchants opportunistically absorbed them, while foreign merchants were inactive. The market was stable and tight. Raw peanuts were quiet among Guangdong merchants, but sales in the local market were good, with firm prices. Merchants from Ningbo slightly increased their purchases of the oil market. Raw oil continued to rise by 60,000-70,000 yuan. Rapeseed oil rose by another 50,000-60,000 yuan. Refined oil and bean oil rose slightly by 20,000-30,000 yuan.

Publishing World Weekly

### The Editor's Hopes

— Traditional First

This weekly will be expanding its content and scope starting in December. On the one hand, this shows the spirit of promoting academics by the editorial department of this newspaper, and on the other hand, it is also due to the enthusiastic support of our readers. At a time when labor and paper are expensive, we book-loving friends feel burdened by the high cost of buying books. Some people may go to bookstores to browse briefly, but if you read for too long, the bookstore clerks may "look at you differently," so it is not convenient to stay long. Even readers who have some ability to buy books cannot buy all the books to read. Therefore, this weekly has two missions: introducing content; criticizing strengths and weaknesses. When we introduce the content of a book, first, we must of course choose good books; second, we must refine the essence of the whole book; third, our own introduction should also be a good essay or short story. When we criticize the strengths and weaknesses of a book, first, we must strive to eliminate personal grievances; second, we must not only promote the good but also eliminate the bad; third, we must have some expertise in the field we are criticizing, and our criticism must be based on correct academic principles.

The above are some points of self-encouragement for the editor and the contributors. We are confident that although we have not reached our ideal, we are moving in that direction. Recently, the manuscripts we have received are quite good, and the writers also have expertise. The editor's selection is also very strict. The authors of 90% of the manuscripts published in this weekly before were unknown to the editor. But we also do not bury the works of young writers. We encourage young people to read, encourage them to write down their experiences, and submit them to this weekly. We always publish the best.

The content of this weekly is hoped to be developed in a multi-faceted and balanced way. We receive the most manuscripts on the review of novels. This type of manuscript is the easiest to write, but the most difficult to write beautifully. In the future, we hope to publish more of this type of manuscript in each issue, because readers also prefer to read this type of article. We receive relatively few manuscripts on the introduction of natural science books, but most of them are useful. However, we hope that the teachers who write this type of manuscript will introduce more advanced scientific theories and popular practical science books, and make the writing slightly more literary. The strangest thing is that we receive the fewest manuscripts on social sciences or humanities. I think this may be because too few famous works in this area have been published recently. But we also welcome introductions to famous Chinese and Western works in philosophy and sociology throughout history.

In short, we very much hope that this weekly is not just a "book primer," but a publication with academic value. Our interests are advanced and multi-faceted; our attitude is cautious and objective; our academic stance is to advocate rigorous critical dialectics, but we absolutely despise personal grievances mixed in. Finally, we hope that writers will give us more manuscripts and readers will continue to encourage and guide us.

### Children's Drawing Psychology

— Wen Zhaotong

Authored by Helga Eng, translated by Gong Qichang, published by The Commercial Press

Generally, teachers of children's drawing often use adult standards to judge children's work, which stifles the lively and active ability of children to express themselves through drawing. If teachers can pay attention to the psychology of children's drawing and study it, this kind of anti-educational method will naturally disappear.

Regarding the study of children's drawing psychology, we can often find some short articles and fragments in domestic educational publications. However, systematic and specialized research results include only Huang’s "Psychology of Children's Drawing" (Commercial Press edition) and the one I am introducing now. The former is a research report using group methods, which I plan to introduce next time. The latter is the result of the author's biographical study of her niece Margaret's drawing psychology, combined with the translator's personal research achievements in the children's drawing studies at the Central University Experimental School. It is not a complete translation.

I also obtained a Japanese translation elsewhere, co-translated by Otomo Kazumi and the International Bookstore Editorial Department, which is complete. According to the Japanese translation, Eng's original work is divided into four chapters: 1. From the first stroke to eight years old - color. 2. An overview of the psychological development of children's drawings. 3. Children's realistic paintings expressing spiritual development. 4. Children and primitive art.

However, in Gong’s translated book, he only translated her second chapter and incorporated his own research, resulting in the following items:

Introduction. Scribbling. From Scribbling to Pictorial Drawing. Pictorial Drawing. Automatism. Direction. Perspective or Background. Proportion. Action. Color. Decoration.

Under the name "Scribbling," it is found that children's expression uses only three kinds of lines: undulating scribbles, circular scribbles, and chaotic scribbles.

During the period "From Scribbling to Pictorial Drawing," children will inevitably give names to the things they draw, or announce what they are going to draw before starting.

The "Pictorial Drawing" section describes the developmental order of drawing people, which is to draw the head first, then the body, feet, and finally the arms, as well as the order of drawing animals, plants, houses, etc.

The so-called "Automatism" means that after the number of repetitions of drawing reaches a considerable number, the drawing process becomes very mechanical, which becomes a kind of "automatism." It also refers to the phenomenon when drawing is transitioning to a new format but still does not depart from the old format. For example, children often draw two eyes on a profile portrait, which is what this means.

The "Direction" section points out the phenomenon and causes of position reversal errors in children's drawings. Because children's observation of the structure of the world is slightly less habitual than adults, this phenomenon roughly occurs in new forms that children do not know.

"Perspective and Background" cannot be expressed in children's drawings, and the expression of perspective depends on the degree of development of abstract feeling and complex natural synthesis ability. Therefore, children may not be able to use perspective methods and comprehensive expression of complex scenes until they are fourteen years old.

The lack of correct proportions in children's drawings is common in the relationship between various parts of a certain shape, or in the combination relationship between people and objects. The "Proportion" section explains that children cannot obtain the concept of the whole because they do not have sufficient comprehensive ability.

Regarding the behavior of "Action," we can clearly distinguish it, and it will probably be found in the drawings of sixteen-year-old children.

Children's use of "Color" in drawing is possible at about eight years old. At five or six years old, they always like to use colorless outlines to draw the general forms of things. In this section, the translator further incorporates the research results of children's preferences for colors: yellow is the most frequently chosen, followed by blue, then green, and the number of choices for other colors. (The author also has similar research, which is included in my book "Research on Color Science" — Commercial Press edition)

In the "Decoration" section, it is explained that early children's drawings do not have exquisite original decorations, because descriptive drawing was discovered early on, and decorative drawing has a place at least after the age of six.

When conducting research, the author adopted many experts' opinions and results for reference. Although the translator did not translate the entire book, he carefully permeated his own research results into it, which is also worthy of praise. The author, Ms. Eng, is a Norwegian and a renowned psychologist who has not only conducted in-depth research on children's drawing but also has rich research on children's language and emotions.

### An Introduction to Post-War Transportation Construction

— Peng

Authored by Zhao Zengjue, published by The Commercial Press

The most important thing for China after the war is construction. Regarding construction policies, many contemporary scholars have discussed them: some advocate national defense first, and national defense should be constructed first; some advocate people's livelihood first, and people's livelihood should be constructed first; some advocate that industry is more important than agriculture, and industrialization should be implemented, or advocate that agriculture is more important than industry, and the country should be established on agriculture. Which is right and which is wrong, I am not prepared to discuss here, but one point must be raised, that is, no matter what is constructed, transportation is indispensable. With transportation, everything can be constructed quickly and smoothly. To give an example before our eyes, the millions of tons of industrial equipment that Japan is now compensating us require an appropriate number of ships to transport them back, and this is a problem for us. Therefore, we can say that transportation construction is the foundation of all construction and is more important than all construction in the construction process.

During the Anti-Japanese War, the Ministry of Communications had already mobilized many experts and spent a lot of time preparing a draft outline of transportation construction, which was submitted to the Central Design Bureau for review and approval for implementation. Mr. Zhao Zengjue, the author of this book, was then the Director of the Postal and Telecommunications Department of the Ministry of Communications and a member of the Central Design Bureau, and participated in the preparation of this outline. Therefore, he now compiles this outline together with his personal works and other relevant important documents into this book. According to what he said in the foreword of the book, in view of the importance of transportation construction, he compiled this book while post-war construction is about to begin, to provide academic circles with materials for continued research, which is indeed very meaningful.

The entire book consists of nine parts and fifty-one chapters. The first part includes the construction outline, implementation principles, and a general explanation of the outline and principles, making a comprehensive and principled plan for the six major constructions of railways, highways, shipping, civil aviation, telecommunications, and post offices; the second part makes concrete plans for the above six constructions in the five years after the war; the following parts discuss each construction separately. Some of the claims are the same as the outline, which can be used as a supplementary explanation of the outline; some are different, but they are enough for comparative research. It can be seen from the above that the compiler has spent some deliberation when compiling the data.

That draft outline is the most important part of the whole book. It is a kind of improved, progressive, and complete plan that is indeed based on theory and takes into account reality. The following is an introduction to several of its key points:

Transportation undertakings should be coordinated with national economic construction. Since transportation construction is the foundation of all construction, it should be coordinated with all construction to promote its development. The reason is very simple. Now, according to the first article of the outline, "Transportation construction aims to provide safe, convenient, and affordable transportation and communication equipment to serve the public, promote national industrialization, improve people's welfare, and assist the development of national culture." It has indeed taken into account the people's livelihood and national defense that urgently need to be constructed after the war, because the premise of people's livelihood and national defense construction is industrialization. Now that the goal of transportation construction is to promote national industrialization, it is to promote people's livelihood and national defense construction. Moreover, in the past, our transportation construction was biased and uneven, focusing on cities and ignoring rural areas, focusing on the southeast region and ignoring the rear; and even in the same transportation undertaking, such as railways, water transport, highways, and air transport, and telecommunications and post offices, there was a lack of due coordination and connection. However, in the new plan, these shortcomings have been corrected.

Administrative and business operations should be divided, and business operations should be enterprise-oriented. In the past, our highest administrative organs for transportation were executing national transportation policies on the one hand and also handling transportation business on the other hand, which was really unreasonable. Now the outline divides administration and business operations, so that the highest administrative organs specialize in administration, while separate business management organs are set up to supervise and manage business operations, in order to maintain the unity of administration. As for business organs, it is advocated to be as enterprise-oriented as possible to increase efficiency. These are all progressive methods.

Specify the boundaries between state-owned, publicly-owned, and privately-owned transportation undertakings. What kind of business model a country's transportation undertaking should adopt depends on its political system, economic capacity, and national defense status. In the past, our transportation undertakings were sometimes state-owned and sometimes privately-owned, without a fixed standard, so that conflicts often occurred between the central and local governments, or between the government and the people, and even conflicts occurred between central and local agencies, which affected the development of transportation undertakings. Now this outline makes rigid regulations on which transportation undertakings should be state-owned, which should be publicly-owned, which should be privately-owned, or which should be allowed to be privately-owned in addition to state-owned and publicly-owned. In this way, not only will it be convenient to execute in the future because there is a standard to follow, but these regulations are fundamentally reasonable.

Specify the methods of absorbing foreign capital. We must use foreign capital for construction after the war, and the reason need not be repeated. However, we need foreign capital, and there should be certain conditions and certain methods, otherwise it is no different from drinking poison to quench thirst. It is foreign capital that is using us, not us using foreign capital. The methods of absorbing foreign capital specified in this outline are divided into: (A) issuing bonds, (B) general credit or material loans, (C) joint ventures, and (D) franchise operations. The essence is to plan and control in a unified way and manage according to law. Compared with the past style of individual loans and individual responsibilities for each transportation undertaking, only paying attention to the present and not the future, it is indeed much more progressive. In the past, when borrowing money to build railways, whoever's money was borrowed, whose locomotives, engineers, and engineering specifications were used. As a result, our railways became a world railway exposition, causing major difficulties in transportation and management. In the future, if we follow the new regulations, this phenomenon will not happen again. Moreover, the new outline stipulates that past transportation debts should be uniformly reorganized and repaid by the central government to establish credit, which is also the wisest way.

Other provisions, such as unified engineering specifications and unified management systems, are briefly specified, and will not be repeated here. We believe that after reading this book, we can get a clear outline of the prospects for our post-war transportation construction. To this day, this book is still the first specialized work in the country that discusses transportation construction with correct theories and concrete plans!

### Mr. Ma Discusses Mathematics

— Zhonghuan

(One of the Kai Ming Youth Series, authored by Liu Xunyu.)

This "Mr. Ma Discusses Mathematics," like many other books by Mr. Liu, uses a "storytelling approach" to explain principles. It clearly expresses the attitude of learning mathematics, the path of thinking about problems, and the method of exploring the relationship and changes between topics. It is definitely not a detailed explanation of difficult problems. If someone is looking for a solution to a certain problem by flipping through it, this may disappoint them, although it collects more than one hundred problems and explains them.

However, the reason why the author is willing to sincerely introduce this book is because of its unique solution method. From beginning to end, this book uses graphical methods to calculate any problem. This is something that ordinary mathematics books do not cover, and it is also the most fascinating part of this book. Using graphical methods to solve mathematical problems is not only easy to observe but also makes arithmetic more practical. Graphical methods have already connected algebra and geometry to create analytic geometry. Now the author uses it in arithmetic, which not only helps to improve mathematics but is also quite beneficial for learning science, engineering, and even statistics.

This book is divided into thirty chapters, including clock problems, flowing water problems, age problems, and four arithmetic problems such as bird and animal groups. It also explains why ratios and fractions are suitable for first-year students because they are reviewing arithmetic at this time. In addition, those who are new to analytic geometry can improve their interest in analytic geometry by reading it.

Arithmetic is the foundation of all higher mathematics, algebra, trigonometry, analytic geometry, and even calculus. We cannot ignore it. I hope that young people can make more use of this rare good book.

### Reading Bing Xin's "Divorce"

— Ji Ping

One of the Untitled Collection of Novels, published by Chenguang Company

Life is painful, it is always struggling with itself, with family, with society, and with the entire human race under overlapping hardships. Especially women, and especially women with sincere love and clear rationality, will bear a thousand times more pain than ordinary people have ever endured.

Ms. Xie Bingxin reveals the suffering of women in "Divorce" in a diary style, which further proves its reality.

It was by chance that I found this beautifully bound untitled collection on a friend's bookshelf. "Divorce" is one of the novellas in it. The entire collection contains twelve creations written recently by twelve female writers, and is edited by Ms. Zhao Qingge. Several female writers stopped writing for a long time, and specially rewrote for this "Modern Chinese Women Writers, Novel Special Collection." From here, we can very clearly admire the recent heroic posture of Chinese female writers.

The first article I opened and read was "Divorce," also because I hadn't seen Mr. Bingxin's short sword work for a long time, and also because the current Chinese society is also performing this tragedy.

The story is like this: Wang Manyin, a heroine who graduated from middle school and has been working hard at home for her children for nearly ten years, resolutely and painstakingly takes care of three children in the rear and struggles with life because she does not want to hinder the work of her husband Wu Guoqiang, who is fighting on the front line. She believes that the husband who combined in love is always faithful to her and spends all day painstakingly waiting for the reunion after victory. However, the fact did not make her wish come true because of her perseverance, and the tragedy began here. The news that Guoqiang was living with a dancer on the front line forced her to rush to the front line, and the good dreams she had on the way were ruthlessly shattered by the facts. Manyin was abandoned! And very tragically. Guoqiang gave her endless mental harm and oppression. For the sake of "face," he resolutely refused Manyin's last request in painful despair, "divorce." He not only wanted Manyin to maintain a superficial husband and wife relationship but also used force to prevent her from approaching any man. Manyin's self-esteem prompted her to strive for a new life. She demanded freedom, independence, and a happy life. Although her feet were tied by her children, she struggled to enter "Accounting School" because the prerequisite for economic independence is the enrichment of knowledge. Mr. Yin, who taught accounting, a young man in his twenties with good knowledge and character, was initially concerned about Manyin, and then expressed his love in a letter and wanted to be Manyin's younger brother. However, Guoqiang did not go through the divorce procedures with her, and society did not give her the right to freedom. Women who have been suppressed by traditional forces for thousands of years dare not and cannot accept new love even if they struggle in a desperate and bitter life. Moreover, Manyin's perseverance was still humiliated by Guoqiang, and she almost lost her life under Guoqiang's gun. Because of Guoqiang's repeated oppression, because of Guoqiang's excessive cold and indifference, Manyin, this abandoned and stubborn woman, resolutely published a separate announcement stating that she was officially divorced from Wu Guoqiang, and led her children to a new road extending in front of her for her own freedom. For her safety, for Yin's future happiness, and for Manyin's love for Yin, she endured all the grief and quietly left, and struggled with life alone.

Indeed, Manyin is just one of the unfortunate women with a fighting spirit. At the same time and in the same space, I really don't know how many thousands of women are enduring the same suffering, no, enduring suffering even greater than Manyin's.

This is a problem, a serious social problem belonging to the happiness of all mankind. Mr. Bingxin has more concretely analyzed it in front of us.

Undeniably, this is still a deformed society, a male-centered society. Although the calls for "anti-feudalism" and "anti-ethics" have long been regarded as old historical relics by those who call themselves progressive, the ethics that grew out of feudal society are still ruthlessly "eating people," but they are eating more civilized and cleverly.

If there is still something truly fair and universal in the world, it is sunshine and emotion. Whether it is a giant merchant with billions of wealth or a penniless beggar, they are all illuminated by the sun in the same way. Emotion is also like this, it will never have any snobbery or class distinction, anyone has his or her true emotions, and the reason why they are expressed differently is naturally the effect of the various creeds bound by this civilized society.

Unfortunately, in the same objective environment, one scale is used to measure men, and another scale from the hands of men is used to measure women.

Therefore, the inner contradictions and pain suffered by Manyin are even deeper. She still cannot transcend the world, and like a criminal, she does not even have the courage to read a "love letter." After being abandoned, she still remembers her wife's natural talent fixed by "traditional forces," and sadly and fearfully speaks to her husband's photo.

"Isn't Guoqiang standing on the wall? He is staring at me angrily, as if he wants to swallow me in one bite. I am afraid, I tremble..."

In the end, she didn't dare to accept true love.

But history is always moving forward, and the footsteps of mankind are always moving towards the light. There is no eternal night of darkness, and naturally there will be no muddy path that cannot be walked to the end.

As Mr. Bingxin pointed out in the end, the warning to all women shouted by Manyin's pen:

"I understand that a woman's reason must overcome emotion so that she will not be a prisoner of love; a woman must have thought and be able to be economically independent so that she will not be oppressed by men; she should always think of a road that she must take, not relying on others, but taking it with my own strength!"

Look at your own health! In one's life, only pain and suffering are truly real, and everything else is just illusion.

But, because only pain and suffering are truly real, we redouble our efforts to train ourselves so that we have more perseverance to trek the road ahead that is full of suffering.

"What is placed in front is a new road, whether it is a flat road or a small road full of thorns, I must boldly and bravely go..."

Yes, you must boldly and bravely go!

Rely on yourself! Rely on your own beliefs and efforts, and the road will always be walked out.

May thousands of unfortunate women get endless deep sympathy and the perseverance to fight hard under Mr. Bingxin's pen!

Bless the unfortunate women,

Bless the unfortunate mankind!

### Talking about Faith

— Wujiu

"There is no greater sorrow than the death of the heart." What is "death of the heart"? It is losing the courage to struggle, that is, losing faith in one's own goals.

Individuals who have lost self-confidence generally exhibit two major types of behavior: one is utter defeatism, shrinking back everywhere, and always feeling that others are bullying them; those who sigh "nine out of ten people are worthy of contempt, and a hundred uses are not as good as a scholar" belong to this category; the other is manifested in the sadistic tendencies of tyrannical and arbitrary behavior—using violence against the weak to cover up their own hesitation and wandering. Take the Japanese soldiers as an example. When defeats were frequently reported, they were particularly suspicious and cruel to the people in the occupied areas, which is a clear example.

Last winter, the author talked with an old American judge who had lived in China for a long time about China's future. The old judge said with emotion: "I don't think there is anything particularly sad or worrying. The United States also went through the Civil War, and the result was that after the war ended, the United States was still the United States!"

Recently, seeing the various measures taken by the British government made people feel even more ashamed. In this war, the British Empire can be said to have lost all its colonies in one fell swoop, and the people are suffering from widespread poverty and hunger, but the government has always been unwavering, honoring the principle of "not worrying about scarcity but worrying about inequality," and leading the indomitable British people forward step by step. The food ration has been reduced repeatedly, and Cripps, the executor of economic policies, called on the people of the whole country, saying: "The output of various basic industries in Britain has created new records. Britain has passed the most dangerous stage, and the time of prosperity after adversity is coming."

If we now urgently need to be self-reliant, then Britain is really a good model. We must trust ourselves in order to truly control our own destiny. As long as we can use facts to show that we are truly willing to help ourselves, we will never be alone.

### Dream Roaming

— Nong Ni

Since last autumn, Mr. Yu has written to me inviting me to take a short trip to West Lake at least five or six times. However, due to my lack of leisurely days and grand feelings, I have been too lazy to go out, constantly delaying it. I don't know when I can finally settle this green dust.

It's not that I don't have a love for lakes and mountains. On the contrary, Mr. Yu's invitations have added so many dreams to me. I only feel that although I am separated from West Lake, West Lake is not separated from me. During my reclining travel, I silently memorized:

"West Lake is always present in my ignorance, and the West Lake in my dreams has never left me for a day."

Not only that, but sometimes I have the right to sing aloud or softly:

"What I have in my dreams, does West Lake lack?"

Who says Leifeng Pagoda is a collapsed relic? I believe it is complete as ever in my dreams, without the need for reconstruction. Even though winter is not yet deep, I have seen "Broken Bridge Remaining Snow" in my dreams. "Orioles Singing in the Willows," "Autumn Moon over the Calm Lake," etc... As for now, these seem to be out-of-season beautiful scenes, but in my dreams, they are still clearly audible, illuminated by bright sunshine. Yes, the West Lake in dreams is truly, let me tell you: it appears the most complete, the most vivid, the most magnificent, and the most beautiful.

Childhood has long gone far away, left behind me. However, the imprints left on the lakes and mountains during childhood should never be erased, right? The warm invitations from friends over the past year must also be deeply engraved, right?

Then, why don't I continue reclining travel? I might as well hum: "From now on, I will only seek solitude in the Butterfly Hermitage, lying comfortably on my beautiful couch, cherishing my old dreams: a scene of West Lake, still perfectly motionless."

However, with the country in turmoil, is West Lake truly motionless? I write this "Dream Roaming" to repay Mr. Yu, hoping he can tell me new news.

### Talking About Snakes

— Li Li

Biologists tell us that snakes have no ears. So, how do they detect the movements and dangers around them?

We often see a snake, when it stops moving, immediately sticking out two thread-like whiskers from its mouth, about three inches long. They extend and retract, retract and extend, constantly moving in three directions in front of the snake's head - left, right, and straight ahead. When it resumes moving forward, these two thread-like whiskers are hidden in its mouth, and cannot be seen. At the same time, when it is pursued and feels threatened and panicked, these two thread-like whiskers contract and extend more frequently, and the movements are faster, seemingly playing a very important role.

According to the research results of biologists, these thread-like whiskers are the snake's tongue. When it is still or in panic, it constantly contracts and extends to probe. This is using the tongue as ears because there are many sensitive nerve endings on their tongue. These small protrusions can detect sound waves and all other vibrations in the surroundings, thereby knowing the actual situation and finding a relatively safe direction to escape.

### The Greatness of the World

The latest trick of American magicians is using a "guillotine." The magician asks his assistant to lie under the knife, and with a "bang," the shiny blade of the guillotine comes down on his neck—of course, this knife will not really cut off his "head," but it looks very realistic. Even a cob of corn placed under the assistant's chin is cut into two pieces.

A few years ago, a psychology professor at Harvard University conducted a test. A total of 1,484 people were tested. The professor played two recordings of a certain symphony to them and asked them to judge which one was better. He also explained that critics generally felt that the second recording was better. As a result, 59 percent of the people felt that the second recording was indeed better—only 4 percent of the people told the truth: the two recordings were actually exactly the same.

### Random Notes from the Studio with Mice - Prince Chun's Illness and Death

— Yu Shou

According to Huang Ren's research: Empress Dowager Cixi was born in Ya'an (formerly belonging to Sichuan, now belonging to Xikang). Therefore, she possessed the wild nature of the southwest border area, which is similar to Wu Zetian, who was born in Guangyuan, Sichuan. This old woman intervened in state affairs for as long as 47 years during the late Qing Dynasty, and her influence on the changes in Chinese history cannot be said to be insignificant. However, to this day, no one has written a fair and complete critical biography for her, which is also a dereliction of duty by historians of this era.

If you want to write about Empress Dowager Cixi, you must not forget that there is also a small, upright but weak figure who attached himself to the hem of this old woman's skirt and completed his life. This is the so-called Prince Chun Yixuan.

Emperor Daoguang of the Qing Dynasty had nine sons, and he passed the throne to his fourth son, Yizhu, who was Emperor Xianfeng. After Xianfeng ascended the throne, among his surviving brothers, there were only the fifth brother, Yicong (Prince Dun), the sixth brother, Yixin (Prince Gong), and the seventh brother, Yixuan (Prince Chun). These three people had different personalities, and none of them were liked by Xianfeng. Prince Dun was impulsive and had no interest in politics. His life was completely that of a flag bearer without progress. Prince Gong was more clever and profound, had political ambitions, and loved wealth. Prince Chun was honest and emotional, with a "semi-hysterical" personality. Compared to his brothers, he had the most humanity. Therefore, when Empress Dowager Cixi adopted his son Zaitian (Emperor Guangxu) as emperor, he knelt down, kowtowed, and cried bitterly. This was not necessarily a pretense, but truly the love of a father for his son that could not be severed.

After Empress Dowager Cixi took power, due to conflicts of interest, she hated Prince Gong the most. However, she treated Prince Chun's wife as her own sister and had a special personal relationship with her. She always wanted to elevate Prince Chun to belittle Prince Gong. Obviously, after Emperor Tongzhi died and Emperor Guangxu ascended the throne, Prince Chun was quite afraid of things and did not dare to come forward, and he was also short of talent and strategy, so he could not exert himself in politics. In the tenth year of Guangxu, Empress Dowager Cixi ordered Prince Gong to withdraw from the Grand Council, and all his party members, Bin Jun and Li Hongzao, were expelled. She separately instructed the Grand Council that when encountering major events, they should first consult with Prince Chun, directly entrusting Prince Chun with the duties of Prince Gong. However, in the following years, until his death in the sixteenth year of Guangxu, he was never able to accomplish anything. The only things that could be勉强commended were "encouraging naval construction" and "supporting Zuo Zongtang in personnel matters."

Although Empress Dowager Cixi initially liked Prince Chun, after discovering that Emperor Guangxu had different ideas from her, she began to hate Prince Chun because of Guangxu. Thus, Prince Chun gradually became known for his illness. This old man's illness and death became a mystery in the political history of the late Qing Dynasty. My late grandfather, Mr. Ming San, was skilled in medical theory. In the thirteenth year of Guangxu, after he was relieved of his duties in Hubei, he was in Nanjing. He received a telegram from Li Hongzhang in Tianjin, summoning him to Beijing to examine Prince Chun's illness. Upon arriving, he stayed at Prince Chun's residence and tried to verify the prescriptions of the Imperial Hospital, but he was confused and did not know what to do. One day, as he was taking the pulse, Emperor Guangxu suddenly arrived with Empress Dowager Cixi. After the Empress Dowager asked my grandfather's name, she said, "Dr. Zhang's prescription should be sent to the former physicians of the Imperial Household Department for review." My grandfather understood the meaning, and the next day, he excused himself with illness and resigned. Passing through Tianjin, he visited Li Hongzhang and said, "The prescription of the Imperial Hospital is not compatible with Prince Chun's illness, what should be done!" Li Hongzhang was dismayed. However, Prince Chun's illness recovered that year, and he did not die until three years later. Weng Tonghe's diary on November 21st of the sixteenth year of Guangxu states: "Hearing of Prince Chun's death, I rushed in to pay my respects. The Emperor wailed loudly, and the ministers also burst into tears. I faced the mourning clothes for four hours, and revised the draft of the Ministry of Rites twelve times with Laishan, and then finalized the purchase."

### Starting from Foot Binding

— Feng Yunzhuang

Today, the issue of women seems to be conceived and raised by men. For thousands of years, women themselves have become accustomed to the so-called female virtue of "following is right". Therefore, when men wanted them to bind their feet, they bound their feet. Now that men want them to use their brains to think about women's issues, they are of course still "not disobeying their husbands".

Why do men think of women's issues? Because they first thought of "social issues." They thought that the whole society needs to be rationalized, and the whole of mankind should be "equal" and "free." Thank them for not forgetting that women are also human, so they advocate that women should stand up and fight for freedom and equality. In other words, women should be liberated.

If every man believes that women should be free, equal, and liberated, then the issue of women will no longer be an issue. The problem lies in the old system, old concepts, and old habits that cannot be completely reformed or broken. Therefore, some believe that they should fight for it, and some believe that they should not fight for it and should be maintained. As for what women themselves really think? I think most uneducated or undereducated women probably have only one thought, that is, how to marry a husband, and a good husband, then all women's problems will be solved.

Even educated women may not necessarily think otherwise, but they may not dare to say it out loud because the idea of ​​relying on a husband is outdated, and they want to become modern. So, upper-class concubines consider themselves happy. The issue of women simply does not arise in them. Moreover, it would be worse for them if the issue of women were resolved. Ask who would be willing to get up in the cold morning, leave the Simmons bed, and work hard to seek independence?

Even other kinds of educated women are relatively happy. At least they already have the opportunity to seek knowledge. That is to say, their parents are relatively wealthy and open-minded. They are never subjected to very serious oppression. The truly oppressed women, like the truly oppressed poor people, only hope to survive. How can they think about whether it is an issue or not, what is called freedom, equality, independence, liberation, etc.?

Therefore, this issue of women, like other social issues, is raised on behalf of people who are not very in need of a solution by those who think they are very in need of a solution. Do women who are considered should-be-needy really need to solve the problem? At least based on the current phenomena, there are only a few types of women who talk about this issue themselves: first, modern women who blindly follow men's opinions; second, middle-aged women who have suffered marital pain or have lost their spouses; third, educated women who have no life experience and only love to be unconventional; fourth, female scholars who specialize in studying social issues, etc. In short, the women who talk about women's issues are only a part of the whole, and among these people, those who truly have free, equal, independent, and liberated thoughts and actions are even less than one in a hundred.

This is why the "issue of women" remains an issue.

Father: "Did you pass your history exam?"

Son: "Of course not. Think about it, the events they asked about all happened before I was born. How can I answer them?"

Someone launched a competition to see who dressed most like Charlie Chaplin, and there would be a big prize. Charlie Chaplin himself also joined, but only a third prize was announced.

Einstein once sighed to the sky:

"In any case, this is something that atomic bombs cannot destroy."

### Wandering Flower

— Chen Shenyan

Chapter One: Joyfully Meeting a Soulmate (4)

Around 7:30 in the evening, Zhu Zhai took a rickshaw to the radio station. As the rickshaw passed through the Three Arches Gate, in the dim twilight, a tricycle suddenly caught up from behind, with two bright headlights on. The female passenger on the tricycle raised her hand to Zhu Zhai and said, "Are you Mr. Xu? My house is number twelve." As she spoke, the tricycle sped forward. In a hurry, Zhu Zhai felt that the person speaking to him seemed to be Qi Wan, but unfortunately he didn't have time to reply, and his rickshaw had already sped away. After arriving at the radio station, he sang a section of "Yu Tang Chun" in the broadcast room. It wasn't until 8:30 after he finished singing. Thinking that it was still early, he thought it would be better to visit Qi Wan's house. She must have listened to the broadcast tonight and asked her how he sang. They could study and research together and see if her impression of him was not bad.

Thinking this, he left the radio station and hired a rickshaw straight to the Second Alley of the School Field. At this time, the sky was very dark, and there were no street lights in the alley. After Zhu Zhai got out of the rickshaw, he checked several houses, but they were all wrong. Finally, at a small door on the east side, there was a child standing. Zhu Zhai asked him, "Little brother, let me ask you, where is number twelve?" The child said, "I don't know." Zhu Zhai said, "Is there anyone named Gu here?" The child said, "Isn't that the Gu family across the street?" Zhu Zhai hurriedly walked to the opposite door and saw that the words "Gu Residence" seemed to be vaguely written on the doorpost. In the darkness, he couldn't see clearly. He gently knocked on the door, and a servant came out. Zhu Zhai told him that he wanted to see Boss Gu Qi Wan. The servant said, "This is the residence of Boss Gu Da. Boss Gu Qi Wan lives across the street." As he spoke, he slammed the door shut.

Zhu Zhai returned to the opposite side, but the child was gone. At this time, he felt a little anxious. Regardless of whether it was Qi Wan's residence or not, he knocked on the door several times in a row. An old woman opened the door from inside. Zhu Zhai said that he was looking for Gu Qi Wan. The old woman turned around and went inside, shouting, "Boss Gu, someone is looking for you." Immediately, a young lady walked out from inside. As soon as Zhu Zhai saw her, she was the one he had seen in the park in the morning. The young lady looked at Zhu Zhai carefully and asked him, "What is your surname?" Zhu Zhai said, "My surname is Xu. Is Boss Gu at home?" The young lady said, "Boss Gu is not at home." Upon hearing this, Zhu Zhai was very disappointed, thinking to himself that Qi Wan was not at home, and he had come for nothing. Standing at the door, he hesitated. The young lady said again, "Boss Gu has a phone call saying: when a Mr. Xu comes, please ask him to sit inside. Boss Gu will be back in a while." Upon hearing this, Zhu Zhai felt as if he had been given a stimulant injection and immediately became excited again. Following the young lady, he said, "My surname is Xu, my surname is Xu!" The young lady smiled and led him inside. Zhu Zhai looked around, and the courtyard was a quadrangle house. There were no lights in the east and west rooms. Although there were lights in the south room, they were covered by curtains, giving off a dim light. Only the north room had electric lights, which were brightly lit. The young lady opened the door curtain and let Zhu Zhai in. He looked around and saw that the two rooms of the main room were connected, arranged as a small living room, with several sofas, a bookshelf, and a desk. The arrangement was very simple. The young lady brought tea and looked at Zhu Zhai a few times, then went inside again. After a while, she brought out cigarettes and handed one to Zhu Zhai. Zhu Zhai shook his head and said, "I don't smoke." The young lady smiled and stood aside. Zhu Zhai looked at her carefully. She had an oval face, curved eyebrows, and a small mouth. Her facial features were very well-proportioned. Her face was not made up, and she had naturally fair skin. He felt that such a sweet and pretty young lady was rare in the north.

### Viewpoint

— Ping Zhai

The day before yesterday, I went to visit Old Li, whom I hadn't seen for a long time. Old Li wasn't home yet, so I chatted with Old Li's wife.

The topic changed from the weather to the new clothes of the ladies. Mrs. Li laughed and asked me, "Did you see that velvet jacket on the sofa? Ah, you men's tempers are really strange!"

Of course, I quickly asked what relationship the velvet shirt had with men's tempers.

Mrs. Li found it more and more funny. She said, "Two weeks ago, I went to see a night show with our Mr. Li. The weather was strangely cool, so we slowly walked home. Just as we were walking across a quiet road, I saw a young man under the street lamp who kept looking at my new velvet jacket—Mr. Li seemed to have noticed it too. That night, I had a big red flower in my hair, which went well with this light blue shirt, so it was really a bit eye-catching, wasn't it? Unexpectedly, that ignorant big kid actually walked up and tugged on Mr. Li's sleeve, saying that he wanted to borrow a light to smoke. Mr. Li really lost his temper. He pushed the person away and picked up a brick, and with a bang, he knocked the person unconscious!"

I said, "Old Li's jealousy is really powerful! Did he drink too much?"

She shrugged her shoulders: "Old Li hasn't been drinking for a long time. Mr. Zhou, don't be angry, but I think you men's tempers are really strange."

After waiting for a long time, Old Li didn't come, so I said goodbye. Just as I walked to the corner of the road, I bumped into Old Li.

"Hey, Old Li, why do you like to hit people with bricks lately?"

He laughed loudly. "You must have met my wife. It was really lucky to find that brick on the road that day! Think about it, I had more than two million in cash with me that night, which is still a small matter. Look at the Elgin gold watch on my arm, 18k, which I brought back from the United States myself last year. My wife was also wearing a three-carat diamond ring!"

"In that case, that guy had bad intentions and wanted to rob something."

"Of course! Think about it, in the middle of the night, that road is so remote, and suddenly a person jumps out and grabs your arm and asks you for matches. What good intentions would he have!"

I felt that his words made some sense, so we parted…

"Old Zhou, don't run!" Suddenly someone behind me called me. Looking back, it was my old classmate Xiao Wang, whom I hadn't seen for more than half a month.

"Oh, Xiao Wang, why is your head beaten up like this! I told you a long time ago: when you reach our age, you should be content and enjoy your life at home. But you just love to play soccer. This time you must have lost the game and got beaten up again, right?"

Xiao Wang glared at me and said, "I went to drink."

In the hotel, Xiao Wang sighed and said, "Speaking of this matter, it is also related to you, old friend. Half a month ago, I came out of a relative's house after drinking wedding wine. I looked at the high sky and the bright moon hanging high in the sky. It was very interesting, and I was a little reluctant to go home to sleep. When I got into a good mood, I thought you were a person who worked late at night. Why not go to the newspaper office to talk to you. I wanted to smoke along the way, but I just forgot my lighter at home. Just as I was helpless, I suddenly saw a well-dressed man with an extremely ugly and vulgar woman swaying and coming. That man was also holding a cigarette in his mouth. I went forward and politely asked him for a match. Unexpectedly, that guy suddenly had a mental breakdown and picked up a brick and hit me on the head!"

He drank a cup in one gulp, shook his head and said, "I also blame myself for being too careless. That place turned out to be in front of an insane asylum. This couple is undoubtedly a madman who just escaped from the insane asylum!"

Back in the newspaper office, I immediately looked for the old newspaper from half a month ago. There was a short message in the local news: "Yesterday morning, a drunken young man lost his footing and fell at the corner of XX Road, and his head was injured by touching a brick on the side of the road. He was helped up by the police, and the young man hired a car to return home for treatment. It is heard that the police found from the young man's identity card that the young man is the son of a certain important person. His parents are extremely doting and let him indulge in opium, which led to this accident."
