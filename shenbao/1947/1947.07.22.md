### Five-Year Economic Recovery Plan: Chairman Approves and Orders Implementation; Economic Council Revises and Passes Reform Proposals

[Our Tokyo Dispatch, 21st] Our nation's first five-year plan for economic recovery after the war has been drafted. Based on pre-war values, it is estimated to require funds of 21,937,000,000 yuan and the involvement of 4,968,093 personnel. The plan has been approved by Chairman Chiang, who has instructed the National Economic Council to adopt and implement it.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 21st] The economic reform proposal was revised and passed by the National Economic Council at its eighth meeting on the 21st and will be submitted to the Executive Yuan for onward presentation. It awaits review and approval by the State Council, and implementation measures will be drafted for its execution. This economic reform proposal, which has garnered widespread attention, consists of fifteen chapters, totaling over 5,000 words. After multiple discussions and comprehensive reviews, it was finally passed today. The political sections have been entirely removed, and both in terms of content and style, it is much more thorough than the original draft. It can be described as the culmination of the efforts of national economic experts. The proposal is divided into three main parts: the first is a preface, briefly describing the current economic crisis and the areas where efforts should be focused on finance, production, and fiscal policy, with particular attention to revitalizing agriculture, stabilizing prices, and currency value. The second part is the proposal itself, divided into three sections: A, Finance, comprising thirteen items including banking; B, Production and Construction, including: (1) Agriculture, divided into four items, (2) Industry, divided into fourteen items, (3) Commerce, five items, (4) Transportation, eight items, (5) Increasing production of goods and stabilizing prices, eight items; C, Fiscal Policy, divided into: (1) Reorganizing public finance, with nine sub-items, (2) Stabilizing currency value. The final part is the conclusion. During today's discussion of the proposal, the most significant amendment concerned the import-export linkage system. Some committee members felt that the amount should not be specified, while others argued that it should be. Ultimately, it was decided to designate certain goods for implementation of the import-export linkage system. Additionally, the issue of requisitioning overseas deposits of Chinese citizens was raised. (3) Items originally under the commerce section have been moved under currency value stabilization. The committee also discussed the issue of foreign investment in China. Members offered valuable suggestions, and some were appointed to review them. Today's meeting began at 3 PM and adjourned at approximately 7 PM. Chairman Chen Lifu and committee members He Haoruo, Shi Kuiling, Yu Hongjun, Pan Xulun, Deng Feihuang, Yu Feipeng, Zuo Shunsheng, Wang Xiaolai, Qi Tongsun, Huang Yuanbin, Xue Dubi, Liu Jianqun, Chen Qitian, Weng Wenhao, and others were present.

Content of the Proposal Preface

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 21st] The preface to the economic reform proposal elaborates in great detail on the efforts that should be made in the future regarding finance, production, and fiscal policy. It states that the current economic crisis is becoming increasingly severe and that the root causes should be explored for reform. Based on the factors of production, namely land, capital, and labor, rural areas lack only capital. How financial institutions themselves can be strengthened and enriched, and how their funds can be properly coordinated with land and labor to achieve rural prosperity, increase farmers' purchasing power, and lay the foundation for and develop the domestic light industry. As for the operations of various banks, there should be a clear division of labor, each with its own specialty and mission, mutually contributing to economic development. This is what urgently needs reform in the financial sector. Secondly, how to transform an agricultural country into an industrialized one is the most important task for national construction in the future. How to use state capital to guide the flexible use of private capital, with state-owned enterprises undertaking difficult tasks and assisting private enterprises in easier ones, and welcoming foreign capital and technical personnel to achieve industrialization, is what needs reform in production and construction. Furthermore, fiscal policy should start with the development of various productive industries to increase the proportion of income. How to increase revenue and reduce expenditure, improve the collection policy, and make the fiscal foundation grow thicker with the development of various productive industries, using tens of billions of yuan in production capacity and its total income to support the entire country's finances.

Another important section of the proposal is the conclusion, which points out that financial policy, economic policy, and fiscal policy are mutually causal and complementary. The matters described in this proposal that are being implemented by the government but have not yet taken effect should be strengthened by the responsible departments, and those awaiting implementation should be formulated into detailed plans. Three points should be noted: (1) Reasonably resolve the issues of compensation for officials, soldiers, civil servants, and workers to ensure they can maintain a minimum necessary standard of living, thereby improving administrative efficiency. (2) State-owned enterprises and private enterprises should be placed on an equal footing. (3) A broad economic construction movement should be launched in society to increase public understanding and interest in the economy.

### Our Traders Should Form a Japan-Trade Company; Remarks by the Deputy Head of the Economic Section of the Delegation to Japan

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 21st] As Japan's external trade recovery approaches, Lin Siyi, Deputy Head of the Economic Section of our Delegation to Japan, urges domestic traders to promptly establish import-export trade companies targeting Japan. Mr. Lin emphasized that the Far Eastern Commission is currently allowing Japan to resume foreign trade, and what is being encouraged is private trade, not government trade. He continued, "Of the 400 trade representatives, China will have 64." According to Mr. Lin, before the signing of the peace treaty with Japan, Japan's foreign trade is still under the control of the Allied Headquarters. Traders coming to Japan must be approved by the Allied Headquarters. Foreign traders in Japan can directly contact Japanese traders, but any commercial contract must be approved by the Allied Headquarters before it can be concluded. For example, if a Chinese trader and a Japanese trader agree to enter into a contract, the Chinese trader should report this to the Chinese Delegation to Japan for submission to the Allied Headquarters for approval. Mr. Lin stated that all prices are set by the Allied Headquarters according to world market prices, and all transactions are calculated in US dollars. Exported goods will be divided into two categories: one is government trade, and the other is private trade. Raw silk, cotton textiles, and tea belong to government trade. Goods can be picked up locally or in China. In the former case, Chinese traders are responsible for freight, while in the latter case, the Allied Headquarters and the Japanese side assist with freight. Mr. Lin continued that methods will be established to allow Chinese traders to use Chinese ships. When asked whether overseas Chinese in Japan can engage in import-export trade between China and Japan, Mr. Lin replied that it requires the approval of the Chinese government. Mr. Lin further explained that Chinese traders who wish to trade in Japan must first apply to the Ministry of Economic Affairs for approval, and then the Ministry of Economic Affairs will send a letter to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to instruct the Chinese Delegation to Japan to apply to the Allied Headquarters for the trader's exit permit. Mr. Lin also announced that our country will soon send a trade delegation to Japan. (The "Legislators Xiao Zheng and Huang Yuanbin Discuss Opening Trade with Japan" reported on page two of yesterday's newspaper. Note that Xiao Zheng is a member of the National Economic Council, not a legislator. This correction is attached.)

### Mo Dehui Speaks: Plans to Request Funds to Resettle Northeast Volunteer Army

[Our Report] Government member Mo Dehui told reporters: "This entire matter regarding the Volunteer Army has brought me to Shanghai, and I plan to return to Nanjing on the 23rd. Regarding the resettlement of the Volunteer Army after their return to their hometowns, I plan to request 1 billion circulation coupons from the central government as resettlement funds. After they return to the Northeast, most will engage in military reclamation, some will enter factories, and the old, weak, and disabled will be provided with relief and accommodation. Every effort will be made to prevent them from becoming displaced. The state's preferential treatment of this group of soldiers who were the first to resist Japan will naturally benefit future resistance against foreign aggression. The Northeast has now become a flashpoint in the world, and its future development is related to the safety of the world. The Northwest is also our country's border, and its importance cannot be separated from that of the Northeast. General Wedemeyer's visit to China will enhance Sino-American friendship. China's current situation requires either the United States and the Soviet Union to withdraw together and allow China to decide its own future, or the United States to support our country in dealing with the expansion of communism. One of these two must be the case." When asked whether the rumor that Zhang Xueliang was at Mogan Mountain was reliable, Mr. Mo replied, "Zhang Xueliang has not left Taiwan."

### Zhang Xueliang Still in Taiwan: Recently Sent a Letter to His Brother Zhang Xueming

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 21st] Sources in the know say that Zhang Xueliang is still in Taiwan and the rumor of him flying to Zhejiang is not true. Zhang recently sent a letter to his brother Zhang Xueming, saying that the Northeast has been lost for too long, and it is not necessary to ask the Disposal Bureau to return old properties. Zhang Xueming is currently the Chief Advisor of the Northeast Security Commander Department and has come to Beiping on business. Before General Chen left Beiping, he summoned him for a meeting.

### Popular Armed Forces Create Peace in Chahar, Suiyuan, and Northern Shanxi; Fu Zuoyi Speaks to Our Reporter

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 21st] Fu Zuoyi, Director of the Zhangjiakou Pacification Headquarters, met with our reporter on the morning of the 21st. According to him, Chahar, Suiyuan, and northern Shanxi are generally peaceful at present. This peace is created by the people's armed forces. For example, a village eight kilometers from Yongning recently used its self-defense force of more than twenty rifles to fight against 1,200 communist bandits, sixty times their number, for more than four hours. After the national army arrived, they finally eliminated the communist bandits. If the people receive support from the government, they will devote themselves to defending their hometowns, and the communist bandits will have no place to survive. Chahar Province had a good wheat harvest this year, and military and civilian food supplies are generally not a concern. As for the issue of the grain department's requisitioning, Chahar Province, due to the large price difference, adopts the principle of purchasing surplus grain and does not use quota purchases to avoid unfair burdens on small and medium-sized farmers and embezzlement by unscrupulous elements. Chahar Province's industry and commerce have been severely damaged by the communist army and are difficult to restore, but they are now much better than before August and September. Regarding the invasion of Suiyuan by Mongolian troops, Mr. Fu said, "I have heard nothing about it," but he did not deny the possibility. Regarding whether the border defense forces can cope with emergencies in the future, he said that from the current point of view, this does not seem to be a major concern. As for the future, military changes are very rapid and cannot be predicted. Mr. Fu is as robust as ever, and his conversation shows that he is quite optimistic about the future of the provinces in Inner Mongolia. It is reported that this trip to Nanjing is to discuss and seek instructions on some business matters and that he will return to his defense post soon.

### Qinghai Provincial Assembly Members Support Mobilization to Suppress Rebellion

[Our Xining Dispatch, 20th] The Qinghai Provincial Assembly, representing two million people, met on July 18, deeply hating the communist bandits' treason, and resolved to send a telegram to Chairman Chiang, expressing support for the National General Mobilization Order. The telegram stated: "The Communist Party, relying on foreign forces, has launched large-scale rebellions everywhere, seized cities, and massacred people. Wherever they go, towns and villages are left in ruins. Negotiations have already failed, and the people are trapped in fire and water. Fortunately, Your Excellency has complied with the people's wishes and resolutely suppressed the rebellion, which is an opportunity for our country to turn danger into safety. This assembly unanimously supports it and represents the two million people of this province, vowing to be the rearguard."

Wang Yunwu, Vice President of the Executive Yuan, Weng Wenhao, Chairman of the Resources Committee, Yu Hongjun, Minister of Finance, Wang Shijie, Minister of Foreign Affairs, and Zhang Jia'ao, Governor of the Central Bank, will all exchange views with Mr. Wedemeyer on matters within their respective departments, in the hope that the United States will provide economic assistance to China.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, Twenty-first] Wedemeyer's visit to China will involve in-depth research on our country's economy to serve as a reference for assisting China. It is learned that the economic reform plan proposed by Zhang Qun and passed by the National Economic Council will also be submitted to Mr. Wedemeyer for discussion.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 20th] General Wedemeyer graduated from the US Military Academy in 1918, served as a Second Lieutenant in the Army, and was sent to Europe the following year to inspect the battlefields of France, Belgium, and Germany. After returning to the country, he re-entered the famous Fort Benning Military School in Georgia. After graduating, he entered the 29th Infantry Regiment. In 1923, he was sent to serve in the Philippines for two years. From 1925 to 1930, he returned to the United States to work. In 1930, he was sent to China to serve in the US 15th Infantry Regiment stationed in Tianjin for two years, and then went to the Philippines again. In 1934, he went to the Fort Leavenworth Command and Staff School in Kansas. After graduating in 1936, he went to the Berlin Military Academy. In 1938, he returned to the United States and served in the infantry and defensive tank corps. In September 1940, he served in the Infantry Training Department. In May 1941, he was appointed as a Planning Committee Member of the Operations Planning Bureau of the Army General Staff Headquarters. In June 1942, he was promoted to Assistant Deputy Chief of Staff of the Operations Command. Mr. Wedemeyer was promoted to Lieutenant General on January 1, 1943.

[United Press, Nanjing, Twenty-first] Foreign observers hope that Wedemeyer's visit will end the ambiguous policy implemented by the United States after the end of Marshall's mission to China. No one in the capital can predict the true nature of the Wedemeyer delegation. Its so-called "fact-finding" mission is considered a vague term. Well-informed sources say that the dispatch of this delegation with such high authority is unlikely to be merely for "finding facts."

### Comprehensive Planning to Strengthen Local Armed Forces in Rehe Province

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 21st] Liu Duoquan, Chairman of Rehe Province, came to Beiping a few days ago for treatment of chronic hemorrhoids and will not leave Beiping in the short term. Liu told reporters today that he had asked General Chen to instruct on strengthening local armed forces. When the Chairman first came to Beiping, he approved the establishment of five security battalions in Rehe Province. Due to funding issues, the number of battalions established is insufficient, the equipment is poor, and it is difficult to cooperate with the national army in combat. General Chen has promised to comprehensively plan and improve the situation after arriving in Nanjing. Western Rehe has been generally peaceful recently, but the military strength is still weak. Due to military relations, public administration is difficult to promote. This year's budget for Rehe Province is 17.2 billion, of which 4 billion is raised by the province itself. The communist bandits in Rehe have five infantry brigades, one cavalry brigade, six independent regiments, and twelve county detachments. If the national army had three armies, they could be completely annihilated.

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 21st] According to intelligence obtained by Rehe officials, more than 100 cars driven by nationals of a certain country are frequently traveling between Chifeng and Yebaishou to transport supplies for the communist army. The relevant authorities have reported this matter to General Chen in Beiping.

### The US Is Intensifying Research on Using Molybdenum Instead of Tungsten; May Affect Our Country's Tungsten Ore Exports

[Central News Agency, New York, 20th] The US "Business Week" reported that molybdenum is now being fully utilized as an important substitute for tungsten in high-speed tools in the US steel industry. Of all metals other than tungsten, molybdenum produces the greatest power at high temperatures, but tungsten is more expensive than molybdenum, and its importance is twice that of the latter, and there are limitations in size and shape. Currently, Westinghouse Electric Corporation in the United States is intensifying its research and development of peacetime uses for molybdenum. From China's perspective, the improvement of molybdenum may severely hit its exports of tungsten to the United States, as China is the world's largest supplier of tungsten and the United States is the largest consumer of tungsten.

[Our Ji Nan Correspondent, 21st] The war situation in Yan, Zou, Teng, Wen Shang, and Ji Ning has become缓和d. The Communist bandits, after being attacked from both east and west by the National Army, have felt unable to sustain themselves and appear to be attempting to break through and flee back along their original route to the northeast. The National Army is stepping up its encirclement.

[Our Qing Dao Correspondent, 21st] Chen Yi has currently set up a command post in Gao Mi. This information has been confirmed in the military's press releases.

[Our Xu Zhou Correspondent, 21st] The National Army in western Shandong retook Ning Yang at 2:00 PM on the 21st. The remaining Communist bandits fled west to Yang Shan Ji. The National Army launched a counterattack and achieved an unprecedented great victory. On the 20th, the National Army encircled and suppressed the Communist bandits northwest of Yang Shan Ji.

### General Election Office Completes National Election Budget of 90 Billion, Submitted to National Government for Approval

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 21st] The national election expenses have been budgeted by the General Election Office and submitted to the National Government for approval, along with a request for instructions on the source of funds for subsequent payments. The total cost is estimated at 90 billion yuan. According to the principles for raising election funds established by the General Election Office in 1946, each province and municipality should primarily raise its own funds, supplemented by central government subsidies. However, since the elections for the National Assembly and the Legislative Yuan are being held simultaneously this year, the costs are enormous. The central government is currently carefully considering the principles for allocating funds. Before the full budget is approved and announced, the election expenses for each province, municipality, county, and district will be temporarily advanced by the local governments. The budget will be announced after it is finalized.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 21st] Regarding the handling of election fraud cases, a spokesperson for the General Election Office told reporters on the 21st: Detailed regulations for handling election law violations are clearly stipulated in our country's criminal law. If a lawsuit is filed during the election period, it should be processed according to legal procedures. However, with regard to election fraud cases, the courts may expedite the processing, and since the circumstances of such lawsuits are often simple, judgments are easier to make. Furthermore, the re-elections after judgments have a definite deadline. The re-election for National Assembly representatives should be held within fifteen days of the judgment, and the re-election for Legislative Yuan members should not exceed thirty days after the judgment is finalized. Therefore, due to the time constraints, unless the courts expedite the trials, the election results will not be completed. As for those who resume campaigning through improper means or illegal actions, the Legislative Yuan has also decided on handling measures. Except for cases that are resolved by the courts due to litigation, all other circumstances will be strictly prohibited and suppressed by the governments of each election district.

[Our Dispatch] According to Wang Shi Zeng, a standing committee member of the China Youth Party, proportional representation was proposed by the Democratic Socialist Party, and the China Youth Party expresses its agreement with this.

The China Youth Party has always advocated for participation in local governments, but the negotiations are not as fruitful as reported by the outside world and are still in the negotiation stage. Furthermore, the China Youth Party is scheduled to hold a national congress next month, also in Shanghai. Wang denied the external reports that party members participating in the government cannot inquire about party affairs.

### Li Wei Guo Reports on KMT Propaganda Plan at Weekly Memorial Service: Mobilizing National Strength is the Only Way to Achieve Great Results

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 21st] The Kuomintang (KMT) Central Headquarters held the weekly memorial service for Dr. Sun Yat-sen at 9:00 AM on the 21st in the headquarters' auditorium. After Committee Member Zou and Chairman Lu performed the rituals, the newly appointed Minister of Propaganda, Li Wei Guo, was invited to report. Li said that since he had only been in office for less than a week and was not yet fully familiar with the work of the ministry, he would first present a report on the propaganda plan drafted according to the instructions of the Director-General (Chiang Kai-shek). The draft plan will be submitted to the Central Standing Committee for discussion. According to Li's report, in his personal view, the KMT's propaganda work should adhere to the following principles: (1) Propaganda cannot be divorced from the environment, especially the international environment; (2) Propaganda is equivalent to combat, so it is necessary to take the initiative, use offense as defense, and have both advances and retreats; (3) Propaganda is a kind of psychological warfare, so winning hearts is paramount, persuasion is paramount, and truth and facts come first; (4) The KMT is a grand political party, and its propaganda should have the grandeur of a grand political party. Regarding propaganda policy, in a passive aspect, we must protect the freedom of speech in society. In an active aspect, we must pay attention to the following points: (1) The propaganda of doctrine and theory must be adapted to the times; (2) To establish the foundation of the country, there must be a sound basis of public opinion; (3) For the country to be prosperous and happy, the Principle of People's Livelihood must be implemented. Other good measures for general mobilization and various agencies should also be widely promoted. As for propaganda techniques, the most important are unified command and close cooperation among various agencies. At the same time, propaganda must be carried out through organizations and the strength of the whole country should be mobilized in order to achieve great results. Finally, Li explained his hopes after arriving at the ministry, saying: I hope that the work of the Ministry of Propaganda can be pragmatic, that propagandists can be as "vigorous as dragons and tigers," and that our party can be "vibrant and colorful."

### After Feng Qing Ship Runs Aground: 30 Injured, 2 Dead

Shipping Company Denies Exceeding Passenger Limit

[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 20th] The Feng Qing, a 6,167-ton passenger and cargo ship of the Gang He Feng Company, which sailed from Hong Kong to Shantou on the 18th, ran aground near Zhi Ling Jiao in Mirs Bay (22.39N, 115.34E) en route. The ship's hull was severed. Fortunately, the 1,800 passengers were rescued by ships that came to their aid and returned to Hong Kong. Only 30 people were injured and 2 died. The ships that came to their aid included the American ships Hawkins and Fox, the British ship Hartal, the Chinese ship Shan Xi, the Soviet ship Nomid, the British ship Hunan, and rescue tugboats.

[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 21st] One hundred of the passengers of the Feng Qing, who were rescued and returned to Hong Kong, were transported back to Shantou on the Wan Fu Shi ship on the 21st. The remaining passengers are still staying in relief shelters, awaiting transport back to Shantou and Xiamen. It is reported that some of the passengers rescued by another ship had not yet arrived in Hong Kong by the morning of the 21st.

[Central News Agency, Singapore, 21st] The He Feng Shipping Company told the Central News Agency reporter today that the company's passenger ship Yu Qing, which was sailing between Hong Kong and Shantou, sank. All 1,800 passengers were rescued. The company's only remaining ship, Feng Xiang, will still sail to Hong Kong tomorrow as scheduled. Approximately one thousand passengers have registered for the ship so far, which is much lower than usual. This may be due to the accident in Hong Kong. Today, company officials met with the Central News Agency reporter and denied the Associated Press report that the Feng Qing was only approved to carry one thousand and fifty passengers. They said that the ship's license allowed it to carry 2,400 passengers. They also said that the sinking of the Feng Qing was the company's greatest loss. He Feng is the only shipping company purely capitalized by Chinese investors. It used to have five ships. Strangely, the Feng Mo and Feng Ming ships also sank in the same location as the Feng Qing. The Feng Ping ship sank in the Indian Ocean during this war. The company estimates that the Feng Qing and Feng Xiang ships had a turnover of nearly ten million US dollars in the past two years.

### Zhao Shuhua, a Woman from the Old Capital, Arrested for Using an Alias to Defraud, Fabricating a Company Name to Recruit Employees, Advertising Extensively and Illegally Collecting Application Fees

[This Newspaper, Beiping, 21st] The Beiping Garrison Command arrested a woman on the 19th who flaunted her wealth and used the alias Xu Liyuan to recruit employees in the name of "Fuzhong Company" and defraud them of application fees. Although the amount defrauded was only 2 million yuan, more than 600 people were deceived. This woman's real name is Zhao Shuhua, 30 years old. Before the Anti-Japanese War, she graduated from Beiman Girls' High School. In 1939, she worked undercover for the Military Statistics Bureau in Beiping. In the spring of 1940, she was imprisoned by the Japanese military police for one year and two months. Her husband, Yu, was a colonel and chief of staff in a certain garrison district in Guizhou. He is now in his hometown of Heishan County, Northeast China. They separated during the Anti-Japanese War. In Beiping, she had no means of living and had cohabited with seven men. Recently, she cohabited with a man named Zhang. They often sold everything they owned. Recently, Yu sent a letter asking her to quickly return to her hometown in Northeast China with her twelve-year-old daughter. Because she had no money for the trip, she devised a plan to defraud money. She continuously placed advertisements in various newspapers, fabricating "Fuzhong Company" to recruit employees at all levels, publishing attractive salary figures. Until the day of her arrest, applicants were still flocking to her, each charged 3,000 yuan. Before the incident, she had held an examination once in the two humble rooms where she lived and was discovered to have loopholes. She claimed to be the personnel director of "Fuzhong Company." When applicants raised questions, she would order her lover, Zhang, to entertain them, while she claimed to go to the manager's house of a certain company to discuss funds, taking a pre-arranged car and driving around outside to show off her wealth and make it seem real. She also claimed that this company was related to the Joint Logistics Headquarters, with the head office in Tianjin and a branch in Haidian, a western suburb of Beiping, in order to collect enough application fees to secretly return to her hometown in Northeast China, leaving her lover behind. Later, she was recognized and arrested by the Baojia chief. At first, she stubbornly refused to confess, but later, because her statements were full of loopholes, she wrote a long confession of thousands of words, fluent and coherent, in one stroke. The main idea was: Because she wanted to return home and see her husband, she tried every means to raise travel expenses but could not. She borrowed the name of recruiting employees to defraud application fees. Because train tickets were difficult to buy, she did not make the trip. She knew that everything she did was outside the law and that she should bear the responsibility for her actions alone.

[This Newspaper, Suzhou, 21st] The Lichang Rice Mill in Xiangcheng Town, under the jurisdiction of the county, was previously found by the Suzhou County Government to have hoarded over a thousand shi of rice, both rough and polished. Considering that the factory's business was not the buying and selling of grain, but only processing on behalf of customers, and that it had purchased and hoarded a large quantity of grain, which was a clear violation of the grain control regulations, the hoarded grain was sealed up, and the manager, Wang Shengchu, was arrested and transferred to the Wujiang District Court for legal action. The trial has now concluded. Yesterday, Judge Zhang Xiyong announced the verdict: Wang Shengchu was sentenced to six months in prison, which, in accordance with Article 41 of the Criminal Law, can be commuted to a fine of one thousand yuan per day. The seized grain, excluding the amount stored for customers, which included one hundred and fifty market stones of purchased and hoarded rough and polished rice, and eighty-seven dan and ninety market jin of japonica rice, were all confiscated. This case is the first case in Suzhou of grain merchants being punished for violating grain control regulations.

### Editorial: Congratulating India's Rebirth

At 10:40 AM (Greenwich Mean Time) on July 18, 1947, the British House of Lords, the upper house of the British Parliament, was holding a solemn ceremony: the King's Privy Council was meeting there, and the Lord Chancellor, dressed in formal attire and wearing something resembling hair, was presiding over the meeting. The Clerk of the Parliament, using 11th-century Norman French, declared: "The King wills it thus." In this historically significant setting, the Indian Independence Act, which had been passed by the British Parliament with extreme speed, was approved by the King and came into effect. From that moment on, King George VI was no longer the Emperor of India. The rebirth of India and the birth of the Indian Union and Pakistan were announced to the world at that time. It was truly a historically significant day: the British Empire withdrew from India from that moment on. Although the formal birth of Pakistan and the Indian Union would have to wait until August 15, the fate of these two new nations was sealed on July 18. As a neighboring country with contiguous land, we cannot help but express our heartfelt congratulations on the rebirth of India. Now that Britain is withdrawing from India, the independence and autonomy that the Indian people have demanded is about to become a reality; we wish the Indian Union and Pakistan prosperous national fortunes in the future, even though, strictly speaking, these two newborn countries have not yet been formally born. However, due to the formal completion of this Indian Independence Act, July 18 can undoubtedly be said to be the birthday of these two new nations.

This meeting of the House of Lords ended 200 years of British rule in India. There is no need for us to reiterate this 200-year history here. The world already has a public opinion on this. Especially since 1877, when Queen Victoria was crowned Empress of India, the situation in India has been somewhat stable in these seventy years, and various constructions in transportation, mining, and water conservancy have been undertaken. We cannot but express our admiration for the achievements of the British in governing India. Just as people cannot live on bread alone, the material construction of the British in India ultimately could not suppress the super-material demands of the Indian people. The Indian people's independence movement surged under these circumstances. The unmet aspirations after the First World War were realized after the Second World War, and we cannot but express our infinite admiration for the Prime Minister of Britain, Clement Attlee. It is due to his foresight that India has been reborn today. The withdrawal of the British Empire from India has become a reality, and Winston Churchill, the former prime minister who was unwilling to settle the affairs of the British Empire, must be feeling a thousand emotions. No wonder this old man was not seen at this meeting of the House of Lords.

It is true that the India after Britain's withdrawal from India will not be a unified India, but rather two Indias: the Indian Union and Pakistan. We do not find the birth of these two new nations surprising. India is a continent second only to a continent, and since the beginning of history, there has never been political unification on this subcontinent. The Mauryan Dynasty and the later Mughal Empire, which are famous in history, did not achieve the unification of India politically. According to the epic Gilgit-Baltistan and Shakuntala, etc., during the Vedic period before the Mauryan Dynasty, Indian culture was also limited to a corner. A unified India is an ideal. This rebirth of India, dividing India into the Indian Union and Pakistan, can be said to be a necessary stage in achieving the unification of India. There must be division before there can be union. The accumulation of irreconcilable feelings between India and Islam has been around for a long time; this division of India and Islam can be said to allow each to get what they want. We cannot but admire the British's high-mindedness in its policy towards India, but the various difficulties that the newborn Pakistan may encounter are probably ten or a hundred times greater than those of the newborn Indian Union. In terms of economics, not to mention, this will be a situation of industrial Indian Union and agricultural Pakistan. The industrialization of Pakistan will certainly not be achieved in the short term; however, the Indian Union already has its industrial base. Seeing that the national flag of the modern Indian Union has abandoned the hand-operated spinning wheel representing Gandhism and replaced it with a turbine, one can see that the Indian Union is advancing in the direction of industry. However, the position of Pakistan is truly important. Beyond the Hindu Kush Mountains to the north is the Soviet Union. It is situated at the crossroads of the East and West: it is not only the vanguard of the Indian Union, but has also become the outpost of the Western world. Britain has politically withdrawn from India, but its moral responsibility does not seem to be easily shrugged off for the time being.

Although India has gained a new life due to the birth of these two new nations, there are still many problems facing India. The status of the princely states is a noteworthy issue. According to the intentions of the British government, the various princely states in India seem to have to "choose one to serve" between the Indian Union and Pakistan. The Indian National Congress also claims that it will not allow the independence of the princely states; however, there are rumors of organizing a "Rajikistan" on the side of the princely states. Although the latter is not entirely reliable, the British will not allow the brewing of this movement. However, since there is this rumor, it is quite noteworthy. There are two or three hundred princely states in India, among which Kashmir in the northwest, Hyderabad in the center, and Mysore and Travancore in the south are particularly well-known. The majority of the population of Kashmir are believers in Islam, and there are fewer problems with its transferring to Pakistan. However, even in Kashmir, it is questionable whether the Hindu prince is willing to join Pakistan. How the status of the Indian princely states evolves is an important key to the situation in India thereafter. In addition, in India, there is also Portuguese India, and there is also French India. Now that India has encountered a new life, these problems will inevitably be resolved one day. We hope that the newborn India can take good care of itself in the current turbulent international situation!

### The Outbreak of War in Indonesia

The war in Indonesia has now officially broken out! Dutch troops, including the Marine Corps trained by the U.S. military, began an offensive against the Republic of Indonesia yesterday, using blitzkrieg tactics to occupy various organs of the Republican government and arrest 200 "rebellious" figures, including Indonesian Republic Deputy Prime Minister Gani and other government officials. At the same time, battles are raging in various parts of Java and Sumatra, especially in Surabaya, Bandung, and Palembang. In the turbulent world situation, the outbreak of the Indonesian war is truly regrettable!

Since the surrender of Japan, the situation in Indonesia has been one of armed conflict, and bloody events have occurred from time to time. Dutch East Indies Deputy Governor-General Van Mook himself is an Indonesian native and is trusted by the Dutch government. He should have been able to reconcile the views of both Indonesia and the Netherlands; however, it was this Van Mook, born in the Dutch East Indies and of Indonesian descent, who launched the war against Indonesia and ordered the use of troops. What a kind of irony this is for Van Mook!

The direct cause of this war in Indonesia is due to Indonesia's refusal to the Dutch request to jointly establish a constitution and police with the Republican government in Indonesia. We believe that the Indonesian government cannot be said to have no reason for this. Because of this request, it aroused popular dissatisfaction, which ultimately led the Netherlands to use force in an attempt to suppress the national aspirations of the Indonesian people with military force. The Netherlands has truly revealed its imperialist face. We believe that this is not a wise move. Needless to say, the sympathy of the world belongs very clearly to that side.

However, it is worth noting that the political struggle among the Indonesians for their independence movement is quite fierce. Indonesian Prime Minister Sjahrir resigned two months ago because he could not stand the coercion of the "left-wing political groups," and Indonesian politics was thus manipulated by radicals, which led to the failure of the negotiations between Indonesia and the Netherlands to proceed smoothly in the past two months. Now that the war has broken out, it is undoubtedly the inevitable result of the rise of left-wing radicals. Precisely because of this, we hope that the Dutch government can act with caution and patience, and strive to end the combat operations as soon as possible in the shortest possible time, without further expansion, in order to restore peace and order. The current international situation is too turbulent, and we cannot allow the creation of events that would increase turbulence!

### The Indo-Dutch Conflict Inevitably Escalates; The US Closely Monitors the Situation; The British Government Also Declares Willingness to Mediate; Fierce Fighting in Semarang, Dutch Air Force Attacks Successfully

[Our Own Dispatch] San Francisco, 21st. Broadcast: The US State Department has just issued a statement regarding the Indonesian conflict, stating that the US is closely monitoring the development of the situation, as the US has significant interests in the area. It is reported that the US has established automobile factories, shipyards, and oil fields in Indonesia. The newly appointed US Consul General to Indonesia is scheduled to take office on Friday. If possible, he will take active mediation measures. However, unless the US receives an invitation from both sides, it may be difficult to mediate, it is said.

Furthermore, news: Success Lake [Lake Success, NY, location of the UN HQ at the time] sources believe that the United Nations is highly likely to intervene in the Indonesian conflict. Indonesia will be represented by the Soviet Union in accusing the Netherlands.

[Reuters, London, 21st] The British Foreign Office issued a statement this morning, declaring that it has made it clear to the Dutch government that the British government is ready to serve as a mediator at the request of the Netherlands or the Republic of Indonesia, and that the British government has fully exchanged views with the US government in advance regarding its actions.

[Our Own Dispatch] London, 21st. Broadcast: The Dutch Foreign Ministry issued a memorandum stating that the Dutch government was forced to use force against Indonesia in order to fulfill the agreement to grant independence to the Dutch East Indies, and accused Indonesian President Sukarno of being a "totalitarian."

[Our Own Dispatch] London, 21st. Broadcast: Dutch authorities stated that if the UK and the US act as mediators, the war can be ended, but the Dutch side must first obtain a guarantee that Indonesia accepts all Dutch demands.

[Our Own Dispatch] San Francisco, 21st. Broadcast: Indonesian President Sukarno delivered a radio address on the night of the 21st, stating that 120,000 Dutch troops are currently attacking the Republic of Indonesia by land, sea, and air. He appealed to the world to urge the United Nations Security Council to address the Dutch-Indonesian dispute.

[Our Own Dispatch] San Francisco Broadcast: The Netherlands released its first battle report, stating that P-51 aircraft began to take a "self-defense" action against the Indonesian air force, shooting down one Japanese-style aircraft on the Indonesian side and destroying gasoline depots, airfields, etc. The Indonesian side has admitted to the Dutch air superiority.

Furthermore, news: The Indonesian President broadcast to the nation today and appealed to the United Nations to intervene in the Dutch-Indonesian conflict, saying: "I deeply believe that justice is on our side. I ask that this issue be brought before the United Nations so that justice may be upheld."

Furthermore, news: The Dutch government today sent a memorandum to the consuls of China, the UK, the US, and other countries stationed in The Hague, stating that the Dutch side has not yet determined the extent to which it must advance, but believes that it will not affect the entire territory of Indonesia. A semi-official statement also said that the Dutch side will accept British mediation when the opportunity arises.

[Reuters, Batavia, 21st] Indonesian Prime Minister Sjahrir broadcast to the nation from the Yogyakarta radio station this afternoon, urging the people of the country to rise up and resist the Dutch invaders. He pointed out that the Dutch "restrictive tactics" indicate that the Dutch are conducting a colonial war to enslave Indonesia again. Sjahrir said that Indonesians should meet the Dutch army in the valleys.

[Reuters, Batavia, 21st] Fifty Dutch Air Force planes and seven army divisions have been deployed on various lines in Java. The Dutch raided Indonesian airfields near Madiun in Java and Surakarta in Central Java. The Indonesian news agency said that the Dutch army attacked in western Java at dawn, and the two sides were exchanging fire with machine guns and artillery when the electricity was cut off. There was fierce fighting near Semarang. Dutch aircraft also attacked the Yogyakarta airfield. Commerce in Batavia has come to a standstill. The Republican rupiah is worthless on the black market. The Dutch East Indies guilder once fell in price, but rebounded after news of the Dutch advance.

[United Press, Batavia, 21st] Dutch troops, including US-trained marines, launched an offensive, seizing various agencies of the Republican government in a lightning attack before midnight and arresting about 200 key rebels. The Dutch cup [a misprint of 'chief'] Van Mook also formally announced that the Dutch army's attack on the Republic had begun at midnight. He also said: If the situation does not escalate, we will only engage in local warfare. Van Mook also stated the Dutch position, saying: If Indian leaders change their attitude, we will still consider it.

[United Press, The Hague, 20th] Dutch Prime Minister Beel today addressed the nation in a radio broadcast, saying that the government has now authorized Dutch East Indies Acting Governor-General Van Mook to mobilize troops at midnight today, Java time, to begin vigilance operations.

### The Plight of a Million Overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies Uncertain

[Central News Agency, Batavia, 21st] Although Dutch East Indies Deputy Governor-General Van Mook has announced that military operations will be limited to local areas as much as possible, the course of events is very likely to force the Dutch army to take comprehensive action. Whether the Republic of Indonesia will soften at the last moment or fight to the end is still difficult to predict. However, judging from the basic facts, the Indonesian army will definitely launch large-scale scorched earth activities in some areas, especially those far from the seaports and demarcation lines. The areas currently controlled by the Dutch army include Batavia, Bandung, Surabaya, Palembang, Semarang, Medan, and Padang. It is estimated that there are about one million overseas Chinese in Java and Sumatra, most of whom reside in areas controlled by Indonesia. Now that the situation has deteriorated, the future of the overseas Chinese will depend on the actions of both the Dutch and Indonesians. The Dutch army's military operations and the artillery, coastal artillery, and air force's shelling will inevitably cause losses to the overseas Chinese. As for the Indonesian side, the overseas Chinese will inevitably suffer arson, robbery, and extortion. This will especially be the case in the outposts of Java and Sumatra.

### British Far East Commissioner to Visit India on Official Business, Related to the Indonesian Situation

### Britain's Policy Towards Burma Remains Unchanged; Indian Troops to be Dispatched to Burma When Necessary; Political Assassination Case Being Intensified

[Our Own Dispatch] London, 21st Broadcast: British Prime Minister Attlee stated in the House of Commons that the political assassination case in Burma cannot change the British government's established policy of granting independence to Burma.

[Our Own Dispatch] London, 21st Broadcast: British Prime Minister Attlee announced today in response to a question from Eden that Indian troops will be dispatched to Burma when necessary.

[Reuters, London, 20th] Authorities here said that the shocking assassination case in Burma will not change the British government's determination to implement the constitution agreed to by the Burmese Constituent Assembly. The British side also hopes that the Burmese authorities can prevent all sections of the people involved in the constitutional work from being intimidated by this tragedy. Officials here are very pleased with the swearing-in of the new Burmese government and hope that Burmese politicians will continue to cooperate in drafting the constitution, and especially hope that the new government will take measures to prevent the recurrence of similar incidents.

[Reuters, Rangoon, 21st] The new Burmese government led by Thakin Nu held its first meeting today, but the work of government agencies in various places has not returned to normal, and rumors have spread that riots have occurred in northern Burma.

Police also took away some documents and two licensed firearms from his residence. The British Burmese Affairs Department also said that police found a jeep, several rifles, and a submachine gun in U Saw's courtyard.

[Reuters, Rangoon, 20th] It is learned that the criminal suspects arrested by the authorities, in addition to U Saw and Thakin Ba Sein, also include Ba Gyan, son-in-law of Ba Maw, the puppet prime minister under Japanese rule, U Saw, leader of the Greater Burma Party, and Lin Wan, who has close ties with the "Red Flag" Communist Party.

The Left and Right Wings Plan to Join Hands

The Communist Party also participated in the mourning and held sympathetic demonstrations. After the Communist Party was expelled from the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League in November last year, it opposed the League's policies, but recently there have been reports that the Communist Party and the League may reach a compromise. Communist leader Thakin Than Tun also condemned political terrorism today, saying that the negotiations between the Communist Party and the League are progressing smoothly and that it is now time to join hands. However, the Communist Party issued a declaration, saying that the Burmese people should now recognize that the real enemy is British bureaucrats and their lackeys. Aung San, etc., can be said to have died at their hands. The British must know that when Aung San, etc., led Burma, the British could not continue to rule Burma.

Aung San's Remains to Receive State Funeral Next Month

Victims of the Burmese Coup: On the right is Deputy Prime Minister Aung San, and on the left is Finance Minister Thakin Mya.

### Truman Submits Economic Report Outlining US Ability to Aid Europe; The United States Must Continue to Assist Those Who Can Help Themselves

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 21st] President Truman has submitted an economic report for the first half of the year to Congress, stating that the United States may not be able to maintain the amount of aid to Europe this year next year. Judging from the current domestic economic situation, although efforts are increased and the national economy responds to the government's call and orders, the scope of assistance we have promised may still not be fulfilled. Therefore, Europe should first allocate and use all its resources before considering the assistance that the United States can provide under the Marshall Plan.

Secondly, the United States' surplus materials may no longer be able to supply foreign countries as in the past six months. However, the United States should still intensify its efforts to help Europe, because this policy has long-term and permanent benefits. It should be known that the United States spends only a small portion of its war expenses on economic assistance. In fact, this assistance is even a prerequisite for achieving peace. The United States has abundant resources and should be able to improve the people's living standards and continue to produce goods for export. The three special committees appointed by the government are responsible for studying the issue of US aid to foreign countries, and are currently compiling a catalog of European needs and estimating the materials that the United States can supply within its capacity. US aid to foreign countries should focus on one condition, that is, the United States is now prepared to discuss the issue of aid to European economic recovery, but the countries concerned must first submit their own plans before obtaining this aid. The United States must continue to assist those who can help themselves. To handle this new plan for aiding foreign countries, it is also necessary to study the economic impact that large-scale US export trade will have. If the export plan is balanced, countries whose living standards are already higher than before the war will not aggravate their poverty. This plan is also the center of American foreign policy. However, the current domestic economic situation still needs to be adjusted one by one. For example, the accumulation of monetary reserves needs to prevent speculation. Raising wages needs to not cause a rise in the cost of living. Only then can the living standards of the whole be guaranteed.

### Wallace Analyzes US Economic Trends

[Reuters, New York, 21st] Former US Vice President Wallace met with the New York correspondent of the Yugoslav official news agency Tanjug and said that he believed that the Marshall Plan could delay the occurrence of an economic depression in the United States. He also said: If the Marshall Plan divides the world into two, or if its primary purpose is to revive Germany to confront the Soviet Union, then he opposes this plan. Wallace said: US production has reached an extremely high level, and the number of employed people has broken the record for peacetime. The cost of living has increased by one-third last year, so there may be widespread dissatisfaction with high prices by 1948, and at the same time, there may be a trend towards entering an economic recession. But if the Marshall Plan's aid loan plan is passed by Congress, the economic depression is expected to be delayed until 1950 or 1951.

### Since the United States Eliminated Communists, the Department of the Army Has Dismissed More Than 800 People

[United Press, Washington, 20th] The Department of the Army announced on the 20th that since the General Staff began its work to eliminate communists, more than 800 military and political personnel have been dismissed for disloyalty. This is the number of dismissals from July of last year to April of this year, while only 61 people were dismissed for the same reason from the beginning of the war to July of last year.

### Western Countries Fail to Reach Consensus; The United States is Working Hard to Salvage the Situation

[United Press, Washington, 20th] US foreign policy officials, who were worried a week ago about the East and West sides breaking down, have now begun to draft the Marshall Plan to prevent the Western countries themselves from tending to split. This is because France has stated that if the revival of Germany cannot satisfy France's security requirements, France cannot promote the Marshall Plan with it. According to France's demands, the Rhineland should be separated from Germany, and the Ruhr area should be internationalized, etc. Germany's future industrial potential is its main problem, and Western Europe seems to be close to breaking down over this. At the same time, British Foreign Secretary Bevin's speech at the miners' picnic last Saturday seems to be a symbol of changing Britain's diplomatic style.

### France Will Do Its Best to Ease US-Soviet Confrontation

French Prime Minister Ramadier Said

[United Press, Perpignan, France, 21st] French Prime Minister Ramadier declared at a party meeting today that France will do its best to prevent the United States and the Soviet Union from confronting each other, and try to make the the two [Germany] countries return to unity to prevent the East and West from splitting. The Soviet Union's refusal to participate in the European conference to discuss the Marshall Plan cannot be regarded as the final decision.

### Internal Rifts Become More Apparent; Katayama Cabinet Wavering; Socialist Party Still Insists on Nationalizing Coal Mines

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 21st] Prime Minister Katayama invited reporters to give a speech because the Diet was scheduled to reconvene on the 25th, briefly stating: At the upcoming peace conference, in order for Japan to increase its international credibility, it hopes to create a government united by the whole country, that is, to strengthen the unity of the three factions in the cabinet and further hope that the Liberal Party, the central force of the opposition party, will give sincere assistance. If various bills of this Diet fail to be submitted on time, it is due to the dereliction of duty of responsible officials. However, after investigation, if it is true, it is planned to cancel the half-day work system of summer committees and strictly supervise them.

There are also criticisms of the new price decisions and emergency economic countermeasures as policies that force laborers to endure hardships. However, the current cabinet has not forgotten that it is a cabinet backed by laborers, so it hopes that those who criticize can understand and assist it. As for the issue of national management of coal, it is the Socialist Party's promise to the people, and it absolutely hopes to realize it. Although there are opposing opinions among the three parties in the ruling coalition, the result has been decided within the agreement of the four-party policy, so it is believed that it can be submitted to the Diet this time. If it cannot be realized, it is absolutely not planned to resign en masse. In addition, this cabinet will not fail to prepare for corporate reorganization due to difficulties. Recently, after establishing unemployment countermeasures, it will use reasonable and common-sense means to reduce the number of unemployed people as much as possible.

[United Press, Tokyo, 20th] Political circles here predict that the Katayama cabinet seems to have encountered serious difficulties and may be reorganized or resign. It is said that regarding state affairs, the rift between Foreign Minister Hitoshi Ashida and Cabinet Secretary-General Suehiro Nishio has become increasingly wider. The internal conflicts in the Katayama cabinet include the following factors: (1) The Democratic Party is very angry about Nishio discussing national affairs directly with the Allied General Headquarters regardless of Ashida's duties or through the normal channels of the Central Liaison Office (headed by Sata). (2) The delayed progress of coal mine nationalization and other social bills. (3) The appointment of Kurusu as Minister of Finance and Hiroo Wada, a leftist member of the Socialist Party, as Minister of Economic Stabilization.

[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 21st] It is learned that the House of Representatives will soon discuss the government's proposed "Political Parties Qualification Act," the purpose of which is to exclude small parties, including the Communist Party, from the parliament. The bill is currently being studied by the caucus of each party in the House of Representatives.

### Soviet Union Plans to Weaken US Influence; Reportedly Promises to Ship Grain to Britain; British-Soviet Trade Negotiations Communique to be Released Soon

[Central News Agency, Chongqing, 20th, United Press] The "Sunday News" diplomatic correspondent said today: Stalin has given Britain 6.5 million tons of grain, which will restore Britain's balance of power among European powers and help us get rid of the shackles of the dollar. According to Mr. Shi's proposal, a special person can obtain 1 million tons of grain this year, 1.5 million tons next year, and 2 million tons each year in 1949 and 1950. The purpose of this move by the Soviet Union is to weaken the United States' influence in European affairs.

[Agence France-Presse, London, 20th] Regarding British-Soviet trade negotiations, according to reliable sources, the British and Soviet governments will simultaneously announce the results of these negotiations in London and Moscow in the near future. Although the British Ministry of Commerce has not yet received any reports on the exact results of the negotiations, the Soviet Union is expected to export timber to Britain. The goods that the Soviet Union may supply to Britain are grains and canned fish.

### MacArthur Approves Japan to Establish Weather Ship Station

[United Press, Tokyo, 21st] Allied Headquarters announced on the 21st that the Department has authorized the Japanese government to establish a weather ship station in the North Pacific, 600 miles east of northern Honshu. The Department has also notified the Japanese government that if it has ships, it can establish three more weather ship stations in the East China Sea, the Sea of Japan, and the East Pacific off the southern tip of Kyushu.

### Australian Deputy Prime Minister to Visit Japan; MacArthur Sends Special Plane to Meet Him

[United Press, Tokyo, 21st] MacArthur will send his personal plane, the Bataan, to meet Australian Deputy Prime Minister Evatt, who is expected to arrive at Kure Port in Japan around July 25. The plane will meet Evatt in Osaka because there is no suitable airfield near Kure Port, and will take Evatt and his wife and four members of the Australian Foreign Ministry to Haneda Airport, where MacArthur will personally welcome them. Before flying to Tokyo, Allied Council for Japan representative Ball and British occupation forces commander Lieutenant General Robertson will welcome Evatt at Kure Port. Before taking the train to Osaka, Evatt will visit Hiroshima, where an Australian infantry battalion is currently stationed.

### European Economic Conference Closes; East-West Rift Becomes More Apparent

[United Press, Geneva, 21st] The second meeting of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe has ended. After ten days of discussion, the rift between the two major forces in the East and West has become more apparent, but at the same time, there have been some achievements that can promote self-help in European economic recovery. The committee is composed of seventeen European countries and the United States, and has now established several specialized committees to consider ways to solve Europe's post-war economic problems. The division of opinions between the East and the West has deep roots.

### Request for Increased Movie Ticket Prices: Rejected by the Social Affairs Bureau

Decision Pending Submission of Accounts

[Report from this Newspaper] Liang Qitian, Chairman of the Shanghai Cinema Commercial Association, visited Gu Bingyuan, Director of the Economic Administration Department of the Social Affairs Bureau, yesterday afternoon to discuss the request to increase ticket prices by 100% starting from the 24th of this month. According to Social Affairs Bureau Director Wu Kaixian, the request to double prices has been rejected. The department in charge submitted a proposal to allow a 50% increase, but it has been indicated that the proposal lacked a basis. An increase must have a reason and cannot be based solely on insufficient expenses. If there are claims of losses, then accounts must be submitted to determine if the losses are genuine, how much is lost each month, and how much the increase must be to maintain income and expenses. Daily necessities during the July price surge have already been suppressed by the authorities, and rice prices have fallen to over 300,000, so entertainment businesses cannot arbitrarily increase prices to increase the burden on the people. Therefore, the matter of increasing movie ticket prices will be decided after the submission and review of accounts.

Yuan Jinfang, a coppersmith, was deeply impressed by it and was curious. He verbally expressed his intention to become Wei's apprentice and learn magic. On the morning of the 11th of this month, Wei drew a talisman for Yuan, burned it into ashes, wrapped it in yellow paper, and said that the talisman could ward off evil spirits, but it needed gold items to suppress it, otherwise the talisman would escape. Yuan believed it to be true and took off two gold rings and gave them to Wei. At this time, Wei chanted incantations and moved his hands, wrapping the gold rings in the talisman ashes and putting them into the belly of a crucian carp. He instructed Yuan to take it home and hang the fish at the door to suppress evil spirits. However, because the weather was too hot, the crucian carp gradually rotted and smelled bad after 30 hours. Yuan took the fish down and checked the paper wrapping in the fish's belly. The gold rings had disappeared, and there was only a copper ring and a copper hoop. Only then did he realize that he had been scammed. On the afternoon of the 19th of this month, Yuan encountered Wei in front of the Chunjiang Hotel on Ninghai Road and took Wei to the Songshan Road Police Station, transferring him to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation on charges of fraud.

### Implicated in a Traitor Case: Three Victims Accuse Zhang Shuping and Others of Extortion

[Report from this Newspaper] Zhang Shuping (resident of No. 23, Bobo Lane, Luban Road), Yang Yusheng, and Shen Jiamin were recently sued in the District Court by Zhang Jiyuan (manager of Hongxing Timber Company in Yangjing West Town, Pudong), Jin Jusheng (manager of Yuanshengtai Timber Company in Yangjing West Town, Pudong), and Shen Abao (manager of Shen Baoji Shipyard in Pudong), accusing them of extortion. According to the plaintiffs' complaint, because Wang Qingfu accused Xu Chengen of being a traitor, the Commercial Inspection Office summoned Zhang Jiyuan and others to court to testify. Zhang Shuping, who claimed to be a staff officer of the Ministry of National Defense, learned of this matter. On the morning of May 7, Zhang sent Shen Jiamin to meet with Yang Yusheng at Zhang Jiyuan and others' places, claiming that Zhang Shuping saw an official document from the High Prosecutor's Office at the garrison headquarters last night, entrusting the police department to arrest Zhang Jiyuan, Jin Jusheng, Shen Abao, and Yang Yusheng, and that there were fifty seals to seal up the four people's properties. They also claimed that Zhang Shuping was an old friend of Commander Xuan and was familiar with Director Tao and Deputy Director Zheng. To eliminate the matter, 400 million yuan was needed. At the very least, more than 100 million yuan was needed. At that time, Yang Yusheng also pretended to be on the side of the victims, proving that it was true, and helped with the intimidation, causing Zhang Jiyuan and the other two to believe it was true. However, because the demanded amount was too large and they could not raise the money, Zhang Shuping voluntarily reduced the amount to 30 million yuan on the 27th. At 9:00 AM on the 30th, Zhang Jiyuan, Jin Dexi (Jin Jusheng's son), and Xi Zuguang (Shen Abao's representative) met with Yang Yusheng and Shen Jiamin at Zhang Shuping's home at Dashijie Da Sanyuan. Xi only brought 6 million yuan, and Zhang and Jin brought 7 million yuan each. The three of them brought a total of 13 million yuan in cash. The remaining 17 million yuan was promised to be paid in the afternoon. Zhang Shuping then took out a confession statement, saying that if the garrison headquarters summoned them for questioning, they should answer according to the confession statement, and he would take care of everything for them. While they were talking, the inspection office of the garrison headquarters had already received a confidential report that someone was impersonating the name of the department to swindle money, so the department sent detectives to Zhang's place to search, and seized the confession statement and 13 million yuan in cash on the spot, apprehending both the people and the goods. They were initially investigated by the military law office of the garrison headquarters, and then transferred to the district prosecutor's office for questioning. Recently, the victims Zhang Jiyuan, Jin Jusheng, and Shen Abao sued Zhang Shuping and others to the District Court, requesting the District Prosecutor's Office to stop the investigation. The District Prosecutor's Office has approved the request and transferred the entire case file to the Criminal Division of the District Court for handling yesterday.

Liu claimed that the gold bar was purchased from a gold shop for 6 million yuan.

### 舞女方珍安葬　黃土一坏長眠地下　捧花臨穴恩客神傷

Dancing Girl Fang Zhen Buried; A Mound of Yellow Earth, Sleeping Underground Forever; A Pained Regular Customer Lays Flowers on the Grave

[Our Dispatch] The body of Fang Zhen, the dancing girl who committed suicide in full dress at Fuxing Park on the 6th of this month, having pre-arranged a burial plot and sent out suicide notes before calmly taking poison, was moved from the Anle Funeral Home to the Hongqiao Cemetery at 10:00 AM yesterday morning. The only person who came to send her off was Zeng Yongxiang, a regular customer during her lifetime. Fang's relatives, her uncle Zhu Chunbao and cousin Zhu Fangju, did not attend, so the cemetery was quiet and desolate.

Zeng Yongxiang held two bouquets of fresh flowers and placed them on Fang Zhen's coffin, looking melancholy for a long time. The coffin was made of cedar wood, with dragon and phoenix patterns and the words "Longevity Pavilion for Ms. Fang Zhen of Zhongshan, Guangdong" carved on the front, which was pre-ordered by Fang Zhen from the China Funeral Equipment Company. The burial plot was on the west side of Hongqiao Cemetery, on lower ground, quite a distance from the group of graves, alone, with water filling half of it. The funeral workers first removed the accumulated water, sprinkled a large amount of lime, and then lowered the coffin into the ground. The stone tablet (with a small bird engraved on it and flowers inlaid on both sides), which Fang had ordered from Jianhua Marble Company, had not been carved yet, so the grave was only covered with yellow earth. A man named Wang from Jianhua Company, who knew Fang well, also came to take care of things yesterday. When Fang ordered the tablet from him, she falsely claimed that her sister had lung disease and was about to die, so she was setting up a tablet for her. The day before her suicide, she went to Wang again, claiming that she was going to another place, and if her sister died, please arrange for the tablet to be properly placed. At that time, Wang did not know that the so-called sister was Fang Zhen herself. After Fang's coffin was put into the ground, Zeng Yongxiang quietly left. He was still full of praise for Fang's character during her lifetime, and said that he would bring fresh flowers to Fang's grave in the future. It is enough comfort to the deceased that a beauty with a tragic fate has a guest who understands her. One more thing worth mentioning is that several funeral workers, after hearing about Fang's suicide, were deeply touched by her actions of arranging her own affairs before death, so they were willing to bury her voluntarily without accepting any tips.

Fang's mother died of illness three years ago and was also buried in Hongqiao Cemetery. Fang personally set up a monument for her. Her grave is on the east side of the cemetery, about a hundred yards from Fang's current grave. Mother and daughter are neighbors and can lean on each other underground.

The coffin is lowered into the grave for burial. On the right is the regular customer Zeng Yong (photo by this newspaper).

### 好萊塢名攝影師　黃宗霑準備歸來　獻身於祖國影壇

Hollywood Renowned Cinematographer Huang Zongzhan Prepares to Return; Dedicating Himself to the Motherland's Film Industry; Currently Planning in the US to Film the Lives of Overseas Chinese

[Our Dispatch] Huang Zongzhan, a Chinese citizen, is a highly regarded cinematographer in Hollywood, having served for over thirty years. Almost all the beautiful actresses of Hollywood's major studios have passed through his lens. Huang recently vowed to shoot a film in the United States or China that introduces the Chinese way of life and reflects Chinese problems. The first film in his plan is about the life and problems of overseas Chinese in the United States. Huang believes that the cost of filming is about US$250,000 to US$300,000, and it will be welcomed by audiences in both China and the United States when it is released. The female lead of this new film will be Lili Zhou Ren, a Chinese actress living in the United States. Zhou has been in the United States for two years, specializing in English and acoustics. Huang has discussed this plan in detail with Chinese researchers studying cinematography in the United States. Copies are being prepared, and Huang hopes to start filming this year after another film is completed. In addition to making a film about the lives of Chinese overseas in the United States, this renowned cinematographer also hopes to make a series of educational films in his motherland in the next few years to complement a large-scale literacy and public health program. These films will all be in Chinese and will feature the 1,300-character basic vocabulary created by Yan Yangchu. Yan's vocabulary has taught 60 million Chinese to speak and write within 96 hours. Huang also stated that he has prepared a fund of US$500,000 for making these educational films, most of which are donations.

Huang was born in Panyu, Guangdong, but grew up in Washington State, USA. Huang's father was a farmer. Huang was a professional boxer when he first entered the film industry, but in 1916, he decided to switch careers and become a cinematographer. After living in the United States for more than 30 years, Huang recently stated: I would like to point out the difficulties and advantages of Chinese people living in the United States. As for the former, Chinese people inevitably suffer discrimination. For example, in San Francisco, overseas Chinese form groups and live in the center of this big city, symbolizing the two cultures of China and the United States, which, although close to each other, have a distance. However, on the other hand, the United States is doing its best to train talents for China to help China's construction.

### 護士助產職業教育　關係民族保健工作　教部再提示注意要點四項

Nursing and Midwifery Vocational Education Relates to National Healthcare; The Ministry of Education Further Reminds to Pay Attention to Four Key Points

[Our Dispatch from Nanjing on the 21st] The Ministry of Education believes that nursing and midwifery vocational education are related to national healthcare. It has repeatedly ordered schools to promote improvements. In order to further improve and promote these efforts, it has issued four key points for attention: (1) Internship work for students in nursing and midwifery vocational schools is extremely important. In the future, when establishing new nursing or midwifery vocational schools, it is necessary to ensure that there is a sound affiliated teaching hospital (for nursing schools) or maternity hospital (for midwifery schools) before they can be approved for establishment. Those already established but without affiliated hospitals or maternity hospitals should immediately set up such facilities within a limited time, or quickly establish cooperative internship methods with local public and private hospitals for remediation. (2) When nursing and midwifery vocational schools are unable to find qualified nurses or midwives with suitable qualifications to serve as principals, the Chinese hospital directors or other senior technical personnel in the hospitals may be temporarily allowed to serve concurrently. However, all actual teaching and guidance work should still be the responsibility of nurses or midwives. (3) There is currently a severe shortage of nursing and midwifery teachers in the country. All factories and bureaus should pay attention to cultivating reserves in accordance with previously issued methods. The originally stipulated proportion of part-time teachers in each school may be temporarily adjusted, but it should still be based on the principle that it does not exceed a ratio of two to one. (4) When private nursing or midwifery vocational schools apply for registration, the standards for their operating expenses and start-up costs should be handled in accordance with the amount for "home economics schools."

### Dong Shouyi Reports on Attending the World Games Committee Meeting; Seven Major European and American Cities Eagerly Compete to Host the World Games

Dong Shouyi, Director-General of the China National Sports Association, held a tea party at the Kangle Restaurant yesterday at 4:00 PM to entertain sports and media circles and report on his attendance at the International Olympic Committee meeting in Sweden. Shao Rugan, Director-General of the Sports Association, executive directors Jin Zhaojun, Wu Bangwei, and Shen Kunnan, Lu Xiangqian, Le Xiurong, Shen Huichun, Peng Wenyu, and sports journalists, totaling over 30 people, attended. In addition to his report, Mr. Dong publicly exhibited a large number of photos he brought back. The following is a transcript of Mr. Dong's speech:

The Circumstances Before and After Going Abroad

Originally, China had only one member of the International Olympic Committee. Later, the number was increased to two, namely Wang Zhengting and Kong Xiangxi. It was not until 1945 that the number was increased to three. Because I was also approved as a member of the committee, I received a telegram from the committee inviting me to attend. I repeatedly consulted with Mr. Wang, Mr. Kong, and Chairman Zhang Boling of the YMCA. Mr. Wang and Mr. Kong were unable to attend due to busy schedules, so I attended alone. After requesting instructions from Minister Zhu of the Ministry of Education, I was granted a subsidy for travel expenses and a passport. After a week of rushing around, I left Beijing on June 3rd and arrived in Sweden on the 16th.

The International Olympic Committee has a total of 43 member countries. Representatives from 23 countries and 28 committee members attended this time. However, including the directors-general and staff of the sports associations of various countries and the representatives requesting to host the World Games, the total number reached 124. The conference lasted for four days (from the 18th to the 21st), and more than 20 resolutions were passed. However, the original text is in French. After someone translates it, it will be announced. Therefore, I will provide a summary report as follows:

(1) Approved new committee members from various countries, approved North Korea as a member country, and approved its participation in the next World Games, but the committee member was not approved.

(2) Approved amateur rules.

(3) Approved the 1952 Summer Olympics to be held in Helsinki, the capital of Finland, and the Winter Olympics to be held in Oslo, the capital of Norway.

Competing to Host the World Games

The competition among various countries to host the next World Games in 1952 can be described as extremely intense and enthusiastic. A total of seven major cities applied this time, including Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Detroit, Chicago, Minneapolis in the United States, as well as Amsterdam and Helsinki. Three places applied for the Winter Games: the United States, Italy, and Norway. Finland received 14 votes first, and after two rounds of voting, it was approved with 15 votes, more than half.

Each of the major cities applying to host the Games has formed a representative group, and even the mayors have personally come forward. They especially value publicity. The key points of competition for each country are listed below for our country to learn from:

(1) Apply through the sports association or Olympic committee of each country, with the government as a backing.

(2) Carry a formal official letter.

(3) Representatives attend to explain the reasons for hosting the Games in detail.

(4) The city's sports history and sports atmosphere.

(5) Experience in hosting sports games.

(6) Understanding of the meaning and spirit of the Olympics.

(7) Fundraising, food and accommodation, and transportation issues.

(8) Climate and the characteristics of the city, especially the beauty of the scenery and cultural contributions.

(9) In addition to photos and promotional materials, there are also models, maps, and movies.

(10) Extracurricular activities and close ties with committee members.

After the closing of the conference, on the 23rd, I went to London to contact the World Games Organizing Committee about the accommodation and food expenses for our country's athletes in the future, the date of the meeting, and the issues of the inspection team. I stayed for two weeks and left the UK on July 7th to return home.

Finally, I must state that: (1) Although the two executive directors of the Sports Association of China, Hao and Wu, were notified of the attendance at the Olympic Committee, it is regrettable that I did not have the opportunity to meet with them. (2) The request to host the 1956 World Games in Beijing is purely a rumor.

### In the Sino-US Swimming Match, the Chinese Youth Team Loses to the US Navy

To prepare for representing China in the swimming competition between China, the United States, and the United Kingdom, the Chinese Youth Swimming Team had a friendly prelude with the US Navy yesterday at the Shanghai Race Club swimming pool. The audience was not open to the public due to the small size of the pool, with only about a hundred people present. The competition was originally scheduled for 11 events, but the 800-yard freestyle was canceled due to the illness of Chinese Youth Team member Yao Jianmin. A total of 10 events were held. Three places were awarded for each event. As a result of the competition, the US Navy won by a large margin with 14 points against 17 points. The top spots in each event, except for the 100-yard backstroke and the 100-yard individual medley, which were won by Chinese Youth Team member Wang Zhongcheng, were taken by the US military. In addition, the first place in the 100-yard breaststroke was originally Chinese Youth Team member Chen Jingzhong, but unfortunately, he was disqualified due to an incorrect posture. The results of the 260-yard relay and the 100-yard individual medley relay were very close, with a difference of only half a second to one second. The results of each event are recorded below:

### The Four Banks Joint Treasury Establishes a Traveling Audit Team to Assess Loan Effectiveness

Work is expected to be completed within two months

[Our Newspaper] The Four Banks Joint Treasury Traveling Audit Team held its inaugural meeting at the Four Banks Branch in this city at 4:00 PM yesterday. Xu Baiyuan, Secretary-General of the Joint Treasury, and Diao Minren, Deputy Secretary-General, along with ten others, attended. Xu Baiyuan delivered a speech on behalf of the Chairman of the Joint Treasury and discussed the direction of the audit based on the Traveling Audit Work Procedures.

The team has one director, Diao Minren, and two deputy directors, Qiang and Jiang Jiannong. The remaining 16 auditors are transferred from existing staff of the Four Banks Joint Branches and the Four Banks and Two Bureaus. The office is located at the Four Banks Branch in this city. It is planned to complete the initial investigation of more than 100 important manufacturers within one month, and then expand to other regions. The work is expected to be completed within two months. This report will be submitted to the government as an important reference. The content of Xu Baiyuan's speech and the Traveling Audit Work Procedures are recorded below:

The purpose of the loans organized by the Joint Treasury is to assist production and revive the economy. Before the loans are approved, the investigation and review must be thorough. After the funds are disbursed, the use of the loans and the production achievements of the manufacturers after obtaining the loans must be strictly audited and assessed to prevent malpractices.

Shanghai is the area where industry and commerce are concentrated in our country. After the victory, the Joint Treasury approved nearly a thousand loans in Shanghai, with a cumulative total of four or five hundred billion. The number of loans and the amount are the highest in all regions. Therefore, the current traveling audit work will begin in Shanghai.

The economic situation after the war has changed greatly. This traveling audit will be conducted by industry group so that the staff can have a full understanding of the latest situation in each industry they are responsible for. The business and financial performance of each factory in the same industry can be compared to assess their strengths and weaknesses. The report of the audit team will be an important reference for determining the loan policy and reviewing loan applications in the future.

Audit Procedures

Article 1: In order to effectively assess the use of funds by each borrowing institution and to fully realize the effectiveness of the loans, the Joint Treasury will jointly appoint traveling auditors with various banks and bureaus to go to each borrowing institution to check accounts.

Article 2: The main points of the traveling audit are as follows: (1) Whether the loan contract is effectively implemented and whether the use of the loan is appropriate. (2) Whether the production and sales costs of the borrowing institution are reasonable and whether the quality of the products meets the standards. (3) Whether the storage of raw materials is appropriate and whether the quantity of collateral meets the requirements. (4) Whether the accounting system is sound and whether the figures in each asset-liability account are accurate. (5) Whether the personnel organization of the borrowing institution is sound. (6) Other relevant financial and business matters and general matters.

Article 3: After checking the accounts, the traveling auditors shall, within one week, prepare an audit report detailing the audit process, along with suggestions for improvement or matters that should be corrected, and submit it to the Four Banks Joint Treasury for review.

Article 4: When performing the audit, if the traveling auditors have any questions, they may inquire in detail from the person in charge of the borrowing institution and consult their account books, statements, and related files. If necessary, they may ask the person in charge of the borrowing institution to provide a written explanation.

Article 5: When traveling auditors are on duty, the Joint Treasury will issue traveling audit credentials for proof.

Article 6: These procedures shall be implemented after being approved by the Four Banks Joint Treasury.

### The Textile Construction Company Decides to Assist in the Export of Native Cloth to Southeast Asia

[Our Newspaper] Mr. Wu Weijing, Deputy General Manager of the China Textile Construction Company, believes that there is a great need for our country's native cloth in Southeast Asia and plans to open up a path for our country's native cloth to be exported to Southeast Asia in the near future. In order to encourage native cloth merchants to actively produce, Mr. Wu plans to exchange cotton yarn for cloth through the Textile Construction Company and then export it through the company. According to Mr. Wu, he plans to start in the Nantong area. Because the domestic production of native cloth has been declining due to sluggish sales, if the native cloth energy can be continuously exported in the future, the production volume of native cloth will definitely increase, thereby saving our country's endangered native cloth industry. At the same time, the government will also be able to obtain some foreign exchange, which is truly a win-win situation. Finally, Mr. Wu hopes that the quality of native cloth can be actively improved.

### The Textile Construction Company Pays Cash for Warehouse Receipts to Manufacturers Who Have Not Yet Paid for Cotton Yarn

[Our Newspaper] The Provisional Joint Distribution of Cotton Yarn by the Textile Adjustment Committee originally stipulated that private yarn factories should provide 10,000 pieces, but as of yesterday, only 8,032 pieces that had been received earlier. It is understood that in order to avoid unexpected problems that may arise during future price negotiations, the committee has paid cash to manufacturers who have not yet paid for cotton yarn to purchase warehouse receipts. In addition, Mr. Wu Weijing, the person in charge of the Joint Distribution Office, said that the cotton yarn paid by yarn factories in other cities totaled more than 2,000 pieces. Last Wednesday, 1,009 pieces were distributed to practical cotton yarn manufacturers in 14 counties, including Hangzhou, Wuxi, Changzhou, Jiangyin, and Suzhou. Approximately 800 pieces are still stored in Nantong, more than 100 pieces in Changzhou, more than 300 pieces in Wuxi, and more than 80 pieces in Hangzhou. The office still plans to distribute them to practical users on the spot according to the original plan. The 800 pieces in Nantong are mostly from Dasheng Factory No. 1 and No. 3. The office has decided to distribute part of it to the Jiangsu Provincial Cooperative Supply and Marketing Agency for redistribution to practical users.

### With a Strong Selling Atmosphere, Chinese Stocks Trend Lower

The news that General Marshall's visit to China was on another mission yesterday further dampened market sentiment. The bulls in the industry collapsed again, and outside speculative funds remained on the sidelines. The market lacked support, and a pessimistic atmosphere prevailed. Various small stocks were dim, and the over-the-counter Yongsha market was intermittent and trending lower. At noon, Yonggong, matches, Zhongsi, Xinhua, and Huafeng fell to their limits. In the morning, due to the easing of silver, all immediate delivery stocks rose except for Zhongfa, which fell. However, all deferred delivery stocks opened lower, and market sentiment was weak. After deferred delivery of Meiya opened, it was sold to 500 yuan. The current price of Meiya has fallen to 497 yuan. Xinnuo was also sold from 160 to 85 to 60 to 84 to 85, and deferred delivery fell to 62,940 yuan. There were not many immediate delivery transactions, but they were only limited to 2,950 yuan. 71, 77, 42, 89, 154, and 219 took advantage of the low prices to buy in. Deferred delivery of Meiya rose to 518 yuan. Xinnuo was also bought back from 157, 19, etc., rising back to over 3,100 yuan. 185, 77, 85, 54, 1x5, and 219 sold to deferred delivery of Meiya at 502 yuan, followed by a long period of hovering. From 10:15 AM to 11:30 AM, 218, 61, 223, and 76 bought in, while 94, 35, and 152 sold, and the market price fluctuated around 510 yuan. After 11:40 AM, retail investors were shaken by the interruption of over-the-counter bidding for Yongsha. 152, 155, 83, 4, 231, 112, 215, and 232 closed their positions together. After deferred delivery of Meiya broke through the 500 yuan mark, the situation changed completely starting at 12:00 PM. Immediate delivery of Yonggong fell to its limit by 67, and deferred delivery by 126, and deferred delivery of Xinguang first fell to its limit by 84. Deferred delivery of Huafeng and Zhongsi matches also approached their limits, and deferred delivery of Meiya fell to 469 yuan. Immediate delivery fell to 463 yuan. 85, 106, 219, and 84 supplied, very close to the limit down. Near the close, although 186, 154, and 23 sold, 85, etc. continued to buy in, and deferred delivery of Meiya rose to 484 yuan. Deferred delivery of Xinnuo was bought by 85 and also rose to 2,950 yuan at the close. After the close, deferred delivery of Meiya was sold by 231 and struggled around 480 yuan. As a result, compared to last Saturday, immediate delivery stocks Yonggong fell to its limit, Xinnuo, Huaman, Xinguang, Meiya, and Zhongfa each fell by about 15%, Jingfu and Qinxing fell by 10%, Xinhua fell by 5%, Rongfeng Cement and Xinya Underwear each fell by 10%, Tongyi Datong, Wuhe, and Jinglun fell by about 5%, Business, Guohuo, and Li'an slightly decreased, and matches fell to their limit at the close. Deferred delivery stocks Yonggong fell to its limit, Huafeng and Xinguang fell to their limits and then rebounded, Qazuo fell by about 5%, Xinnuo fell by 10%, and Meiya, Jingfu, Qinxing, and Huafeng each fell by about 15%. Among the over-the-counter old stocks, Huashang, Zhabei, and Dasheng fell by 5%, and the rest were flat.

Over-the-counter dark market bidding for Yongsha was interrupted from time to time, initially trading at 197 yuan to 200 yuan, falling to 176 yuan and 179 yuan, and finally at 179 yuan to 182 yuan. Interest was 1 jiao 9 fen and a half to 2 jiao 4 fen.

### Government Bonds and Foreign Stocks Continue to Fall

Government bonds were sluggish again yesterday. Tongbing opened at 6,800 yuan and retreated from 6,900 yuan to 6,500 yuan before stabilizing slightly. Room 550 bought in, and Room 360 supplied. As a result, compared to last Saturday, Jia and Yi fell by 300 yuan, Bing and Ding fell by 400 yuan, and Tongwu also fell by 600 yuan. The turnover was only about one million.

Foreign stocks were also affected yesterday. Buying interest was weak, supported only by retail investors. Securities firms and foreign merchants closed their positions. Qingmiao opened at 67,000 yuan and fell to 64,000 yuan before stabilizing slightly. As a result, compared to last Saturday, the telephone stock was still stable, and Shanghai Yarn, British Union, and Shipping all fell by 10%. The rest of the stocks fell by 5% or so, and only rubber stocks were relatively stable.

### Bond Sales Statistics Reach Over 30 Million US Dollars

It was also learned that the committee initiated a patriotic movement to solicit one million citizens to subscribe for treasury bills. Various procedures have been prepared, and the first batch of solicitation letters from various community organizations, approximately 80 or more, will be issued today (the 22nd).

### Key Responsibilities of the Oil Allocation Committee: Six Items Including Distribution, Pricing, Verification, and Registration

[Report from this newspaper] To handle the allocation and supply of imported oil, the Transportation Control Committee (輸管會) has established Gasoline and Diesel Allocation Committees under its Import Quota Allocation Department. These two committees were formed and established on the 8th of this month. The Oil Allocation Committee will have one chairman, to be held by Deng Hui, Deputy Director of the Quota Allocation Department. There will be five members, with one representative each from Mobil, Texaco, Asiatic Petroleum, and China Petroleum companies. One additional member will be jointly nominated by other registered oil importers. In addition, there will be approximately ten secretaries and staff.

The Oil Allocation Committee will also establish branches in major cities throughout the country as needed, to manage the allocation of imported oil within their respective jurisdictions.

The main responsibilities of the committee are six items, summarized as follows:

(1) The Oil Allocation Committee will hold weekly meetings convened by the chairman to discuss the allocation and pricing of various oil products. In case of emergency, the chairman may convene ad hoc meetings to resolve issues.

(2) Registered oil importers should send a copy of each approved import license to the Oil Allocation Committee for record-keeping. They should also report the name, specifications, packaging, ship name, and estimated quantity of each imported oil shipment to the Oil Allocation Committee three days before the ship arrives, pending allocation by the committee at its meeting. Afterwards, a list of the actual quantity received and the actual foreign exchange amount should be submitted to the committee for registration and statistics within a specified period.

(3) Registered oil importers should promptly report the name, specifications, packaging, mode of transportation, ship or railway/highway line name, estimated departure date, and destination of oil products being transshipped from the port of entry to other locations to the Oil Allocation Committee for registration and verification. These transshipped oil products shall still be subject to allocation by the relevant branch committee.

(4) Under the following circumstances, registered oil importers may submit a written request to the Import Quota Allocation Department, stating the reasons for adjusting the oil sales price. The department will forward the request to the committee for review, and then submit it to the Transportation Control Committee for approval and implementation:

1. When the exchange rate quoted by the Central Bank changes.

2. When the price of oil or freight changes overseas.

3. When local labor costs change significantly (with reference to the official local cost of living index).

4. When transshipment costs change (with reference to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and railway freight rates).

5. When domestic and foreign tariffs change (with reference to the official tariffs at the port of export and import).

All pricing matters will be handled centrally in Shanghai.

(5) Various government agencies requiring oil can register with the Oil Allocation Committee or its local branches by completing an application form according to their actual needs, requesting allocation based on the following priority and registration order. The Oil Allocation Committees will investigate and decide which companies should supply the oil. If necessary, a purchase permit system may be implemented.

A. Gasoline: PA for public utilities, PB for transportation vehicles or ships, PC for production machinery, PD for industrial raw materials, PE for military vehicles, PF for other uses.

B. Diesel Fuel Oil: PA for public utilities, PB for ships, PC for diesel engines or vehicles, PD for boiler fuel for industries related to exports, PE for factory boiler fuel where it is difficult to switch to coal, PF for public oil furnaces. (Note: P = Priority)

(6) Registered oil importers should report their sales surplus in various locations to the Oil Allocation Committee at the end of each month for reallocation in the following month. If necessary, the Oil Allocation Committee may reserve quotas for emergency or expedient measures.

(1) Shipping companies must be registered with the Maritime Bureau and the Shipping Association, and only for ships that are regularly operating (those already registered and investigated by China Petroleum Corporation do not need to register again).

(2) Diesel engine users who have not been registered and investigated by China Petroleum Corporation.

(3) Factories using boilers as a substitute for coal (limited to those who have completed company registration, business registration, and factory registration, and have not been allocated coal by the Shanghai Fuel Management Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs).

Areas: Shanghai, Pudong, Baoshan, Jiading, Kunshan, Nanxiang, Suzhou, Wuxi, Changshu, Changzhou, Jiangyin, Taicang, Songjiang, Jinshan, Qingpu, Wujiang, Yixing, Jintan, Liyang, Chongming, Nantong, Jingjiang, Zhoupu, Shengze, Nanxun, Lanxi, Hangjiahu area, Ningbo, Zhenhai, Fenghua, Deqing, Wenzhou, Wenling, Yuyao, Huangyan, Xiangshan, Shaoxing, Dinghai.

Users applying for registration who have industry association organizations should have members of these associations contact the Diesel Allocation Committee of this organization to discuss relevant matters. This is hereby announced.

### Sparse Transactions in the Tea Market

Green tea varieties such as Chou Chen, Chen, and Pearl Tea are mostly sold to French Morocco, but exports have remained sluggish since production costs exceeded overseas prices. Yongxing Foreign Firm in this city, regardless of cost, intends to promote sales there, resulting in an increase of inquiries regarding the product. Unfortunately, inventories in the market are low, and sellers are simply raising prices, thus the trend has a shortfall of supply. The transactions are only scattered, and prices are going higher. Moreover, the year 35 Yuanda brand and Pearl Tea have increased about 40,000 to 50,000 yuan per dan compared to last week. As for other varieties, there are still only old black tea. Wuchang Tea Company has a good demand, and the market remains stable. Local tea shops on this street continue to purchase domestic tea, and customers in various places also consume it well, and the entire process is consistent.

### Oil Business Association Sets Buying and Selling Terms

[Report from this newspaper] The Oil Business Association of this city has noted that disputes often arise from transactions between oil market peers. The main reason is due to a lack of credibility. Therefore, following the recommendation of the Oil Industry Mediation Committee, the association's board of directors and supervisors revised and approved four terms, as follows:

(1) Buyers and sellers must absolutely abide by their credit.

(2) The delivery period for both parties should not exceed the third day after the transaction. If the buyer requests more than three days, the warehouse rent shall be borne by the buyer.

(3) The check paid by the buyer must be dated on the day after the transaction and must not be intentionally returned. If such a situation occurs, the transaction will be suspended on the market.

(4) The seller must not mix in inferior goods. If there is a dispute about inferior goods, the parties should jointly assess it within three days after the transaction at the same price as at the purchase, and the profits and losses will be calculated accordingly. The inferior goods mentioned above must be determined by a fair person before it can be confirmed.

### Sharp Drop in Rice Prices at Production Areas: Both Japonica and Indica Rice Decline

Yesterday, more than 3,400 piculs of rice arrived in the North and South markets. Prices in the mainland fell sharply, causing sluggish digestion. The first batch of new Zhejiang Indica rice to arrive in Shanghai led to a market slump. People are shaken, and Japonica and Indica rice prices are chaotic, falling by 2,000,000, 3,000,000, or 4,000,000 yuan, etc.

Wheat flour, due to the strong market in the mainland, stabilized accordingly, rising slightly by 1,000 yuan. Wheat bran was stable, bean cake sales were still practical, rising slightly by 1,000 yuan. Yingkou cake fell by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan, and soybean digestion was also weak, falling by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan. The situation in Hankou was the most stagnant, falling sharply by 10,000 yuan. Mung bean prices plummeted severely. Secondary products were difficult to find buyers and fell sharply by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan. High-interest Nanyang moved to handle the sale, and prices rose by 10,000 yuan.

Red bean sales were not good, dropping by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan, and barley was also weak, dropping by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Broad beans have been continuously weak and unresponsive, arrivals are connected, digestion is cold and loose, and prices fell by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan. Red sorghum was slightly taken by wineries, up slightly by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Corn distilleries made a move, and the market rose by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Sesame foreign firms also made inquiries, and the market turned stable. Raw peanuts moved slightly in South China, rising by 10,000 yuan.

### Slack Cotton Yarn Market

Yesterday, the cotton yarn market was slack because the monitoring team's yarn and cloth group will be established. It is said that personnel will be regularly stationed in the market to monitor the transactions, resulting in a somewhat fragile market sentiment. Long positions liquidated considerably, but the industry did not absorb intentions strongly, and customer groups also lacked the initiative. In addition, as construction projects sold off, the market was sufficient, and sentiment reversed. Finally, the 42-count Blue Phoenix price made a low of 17,600,000 yuan, down 400,000 yuan compared to last Saturday. The 20-count Special Double Horse also fell by 300,000 yuan to 12,700,000 yuan. Double Yarn Horse was 10,700,000 yuan, down 200,000 yuan. The 16-count Guangming dropped by 500,000 yuan, and the unique price was 9,500,000 yuan. Other yarns fell by 100,000 to 200,000 yuan or 300,000 to 400,000 yuan, etc.

### Weak Cotton Cloth Prices

Yesterday, in the cotton cloth market, due to the still tight funds for the industry, the rate of sell-off was high. Customer groups in Guangdong sold off due to transportation difficulties, and large accounts in the market sold even more, making the market even weaker. As a result, the price of 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth was as low as 43,600,000 yuan, down 17,000 to 18,000 yuan compared to Saturday. Fine cloths of various grades such as Five Blessings, Color Ball, Blue Chicken, and Yanghe also fell by about 15,000 to 20,000 yuan. The markets for other white, grey, bleached and dyed cloths, coarse cloths, and serge plain cloths all fell across the board, but the markets for blue cloth and Shilin cloth showed uneven performance.

### Raw Cotton Slightly Weak

Yesterday, the spot cotton and national yarn cloth markets declined, and the prices were weak. Yarn factories absorbed when prices were low, so trading was still busy. The prices opened for various grades for delivery to factories: Zhengzhou fine lint was 2,180,000, Lingbao was 2,200,000, Shashi was 2,150,000, Han fine was 1,970,000 to 2,040,000, Chongtong was 1,950,000 to 1,980,000, and Huoji was 1,730,000. Also, the warehouse delivery prices L.S.S. were 2,275,000 to 2,285,000, Lingbao was 2,100,000, 2,190,000, 2,200,000, Han fine was 1,970,000, 2,040,000, 2,100,000, Shashi was 2,100,000, 2,180,000, Chongtong was 1,800,000, and Zhoupu seed cotton was 325,000 per bundle.

### Banks Ordered to Suspend Business Gradually Completing Liquidation

[Report from this newspaper] According to Li Lixia, Director of the Audit Department of the Central Bank, the financial institutions ordered to suspend business by the Ministry of Finance in the past six months include Jianguo Bank, Chengda Yinpu, Jianghai Bank, and Datong Commercial Bank. The Ministry of Finance entrusted the Central Bank to assign auditors to supervise the liquidation of these banks. Jianguo and Chengda have already completed liquidation. Jianghai is also nearing completion, and Datong has a small amount of deposits, so liquidation should not be a problem.

Most of the deposits of Jianguo and Chengda have been repaid. A small number of Zhu Tiqing's funds remain; those belonging to Jianguo can be withdrawn from the Kunming branch, and those belonging to Chengda can be withdrawn from the Chongqing headquarters. Datong has very few deposits, and the reserve funds it has deposited with the Central Bank and the Clearing House are sufficient to repay all deposits. The savings deposits of Jianghai Bank's Shanghai Savings Department have already been repaid. There are still a small number of deposits in the business sector, which should not be a problem. The next step is to assign auditors to supervise the liquidation.

Moreover, the deposits and reserve funds of various clearing firms in the national banks are proportionally returned by the national banks according to the number of deposits they return. All of these are allocated in a separate liquidation account.

Mr. Li finally said that the key point of this inspection of financial firms is to ban black market gold, banknotes, and foreign exchange, and the goal is to help financial firms move toward a standardized path, not to passively promote closing and liquidation. The establishment of a financial firm must go through a long period of planning, concentrating capital and manpower, and then it can be completed. Therefore, active support is especially needed.

### Traffic Bank's Operation in Assisting Traffic, Public Works and Other Operations.
Branch Restructuring

In April of this year, the Bank's repatriation work was gradually completed, and the head office returned to the east with the government. Regarding the branches in the reclaimed areas, after examining the environment, the preparations for resuming operations were made separately. Those in the rear areas that no longer needed to exist due to changes in the economic situation were appropriately adjusted. In total, sixteen units were rescued and withdrawn this year.

As for the number of branches approved for establishment this year, there are 84 units domestically, including Wuxi, Nantong, Changshu, Wujin, Yangzhou, Danyang, Rugao, Taixing, Jiangyin, Huaiyin, Baoying, Liyang, Gaoyou, Taicang, Haimen, Taixian, Dongtai, Pukou in Jiangsu, Yuyao, Wuxing, Quxian, Jiaxing in Zhejiang, Anqing, Tianjia'an in Anhui, Zhangshuzhen, Linchuan in Jiangxi, Zaozhuang, Licheng, Weixian, Zhangdian, Boshan in Shandong, Daye, Shihuiyao, Wuxue in Hubei, Xiangtan, Zhuzhou in Hunan, Tanggu, Baoding, Qinhuangdao, Mentougou in Hebei, Xuchang, Luohe, Lingbao, Xinxiang, Xinyang, Luoyang in Henan, Haikou, Zhanjiang, Chao'an in Guangdong, Guixian, Jinchengjiang in Guangxi, Zhangjiakou in Chahar, Yingkou, Jinzhou, Siping, Fushun, Anshan, Huludao, Kaiyuan, Benxihu, Jilin Andong in the nine northeastern provinces, which are located in all provinces of the reclaimed areas, especially in the northeast and northern Jiangsu.

There are 2 units overseas, namely Hanoi and Saigon in Vietnam. As of the end of this year, the Bank had a total of 223 branch units, an increase of 70 units compared with the end of 1945.

Savings Business Situation

The Bank has been working hard to promote the savings business in the spirit of the past, so as to promote savings and absorb market capital. This year, we also paid attention to the water quota savings of industrial and mining employees, and improved education savings to achieve great results. With the turbulent prices and high market dismantling, the environment was originally extremely difficult for attracting savings. However, the Bank's savings amount can still increase year by year. This year, the original savings growth target was 4 billion yuan. As of the end of the year, excluding prize-winning savings bonds, US dollar savings bonds, gold-denominated deposits, and township public welfare savings bonds, it increased by 5.2 billion yuan compared with the end of 1945, exceeding the target by more than 1 billion yuan. If the domestic economic situation can tend to stabilize in the future, it can be predicted that the long history and good reputation of the Bank, as well as the further development of the savings business, can be predicted.

Promote Trust Business

This year, the Bank has actively promoted general trust business. To cite the most important examples, it assisted in the establishment of the Shanghai Securities Market and stationed in the market to handle settlement matters, so as to guide securities transactions into the right track. It undertook the fundraising for the Shanghai Ferry Company to assist the important public utilities in Shanghai, invested in the Shanghai-Minhang long-distance car wash company, and entrusted the collection of shares by various production business institutions. It also tried its best to restore or increase warehouses in various reclaimed areas to facilitate the exchange of materials and cooperate with import and export mortgage business. As of the end of the year, self-built warehouses included Shanghai, Nanjing, Hankou, Changsha, Shashi, Chongqing, Xi'an, Jiangmen, Qingdao, Tianjin, Nanchang, Luxian, Chengdu, Baoji, Jinhua, Lanzhou, Guilin, Zhengzhou, Jiaxing, Bengbu, and Haiphong, etc. As for trust deposits, the original target for this year was 1.5 billion yuan. As of the end of the year, it increased by more than 15.8 billion yuan compared with the previous year, exceeding the expected target by more than 14.3 billion yuan. (End)

Gui Sui, Twelfth Day Air Dispatch

Madame Guo Zengxiang, the wife of Suimileng Sulong, along with her second son, Da Jin-yi, escorted by funeral troops, cattle, sheep, and horses, escaped from the "Xi-Cha Military Region" of the Mongolian communist separatist area in East Sunit Banner, Chahar Province, and after four days and nights of marching through the desert, returned to Twelve Sumu, near Ji Ning County in Eastern Suiyuan. This time, Madame Da and her son's return to the motherland not only demonstrates the Mongolians' internal leaning and their longing for the Han people, but she also recounted to us, based on her own experience, the miserable lives of the Mongolians imprisoned on the border between Inner and Outer Mongolia. The following is a depiction of the plight of a small, displaced ethnic group, as described to the reporter by Madame Da in her delicate tone.

Outer Mongolian Army Enters Suiyuan

On August 10th of the year before last, when Japan announced its surrender, the Outer Mongolian army entered Suiyuan territory by truck. On the twentieth day of the seventh lunar month, they arrived at Twelve Sumu and immediately disarmed the defense divisions of the Eastern Four Banners. At that time, Damiling Sulong was the chief administrator of the Zhenghuang Banner and commander of the pseudo-Mongolian 7th Division. His troops were transferred to Donggong Banner, west of Baotou, for garrison duty. De Wang feared that Damiling Sulong would contact Chief Fu, so he sent him to Xinming County in northern Chahar for house arrest. Because Damiling Sulong was the most prominent figure in the Chahar tribe. In the early years of the Republic of China, when he served as the Zhenghuang Banner's Lieutenant Commander, he went to Outer Mongolia and rescued De Wang from the bandit camp of Jebtsundamba. Later, he served as the garrison commander of Pangiang, preventing Mongolian bandits from entering Chahar and Suiyuan. In the twenty-fifth year [of the Republic], when Li Shou-hsin and Wang Ying invaded Honggertu, Damiling Sulong led cavalry to assist the National Army in combat. Therefore, Outer Mongolia attached great importance to him. On the twentieth day of the seventh lunar month, they went to Twelve Sumu but found no one. On the tenth day of the eighth lunar month, they finally found Damiling Sulong in Xinming County and escorted him to Shangdu County for surveillance.

That time, the Outer Mongolian army entered Chahar and Suiyuan not to fight the Japanese army, but entirely to take advantage of the chaos, looting strong men and supplies, and seeking puppets for Inner Mongolian autonomy. They detained Damiling Sulong, forced him to order the troops to return from Donggong Banner, and claimed to equip the Inner Mongolian army with new Russian-style guns, completely equipping the temporarily assembled troops of Uleji Aosu'er, the commander of the pseudo-Mongolian 9th Division, with Damiling Sulong's weapons. Outer Mongolia was not satisfied with detaining Damiling Sulong, so on the twenty-first day of the eighth lunar month, they went to Twelve Sumu again, and Damiling Sulong's eldest son, Da Jingang, was also taken to Shangdu. Da Jingang graduated from the Central Military Academy and followed Chief Fu during the War of Resistance, serving as a special operations commander in Zhang Lisheng's unit. He was ordered to return to Zhenghuang Banner to receive the officers and soldiers of the pseudo-7th Division who had escaped from Shangdu. Unfortunately, his ordinary rifle could not withstand the Outer Mongolian army's automatic weapons, and as a result, he was tied onto a car and imprisoned with his father. Finally, he was escorted to Kulun with Uleji Aosu'er, and his whereabouts are still unknown. According to what Uleji Aosu'er told Da Tianren, he was undergoing training in a secret location.

After Japan surrendered, officials and civilians in the various Inner Mongolian banners felt very surprised and happy. They were happy to be free from the oppression of the enemy and puppets, and to see the light of day in their motherland again. They were afraid that the Han people would raise their heads and take revenge on the Mongolians. The Outer Mongolian side and Uleji Aosu'er took advantage of the latter mentality to incite the Mongolian people to take their families and livestock and flee to Outer Mongolia. There are no accurate statistics for the detailed numbers, but the cattle and horses alone filled both sides of the Zhangku Highway. Unexpectedly, the troops and people gathered at De Wang's residence

A Perspective on Inner Mongolian "Independence"

"The Mongolian compatriots in Chahar and Suiyuan provinces have followed De Wang and experienced a period of independent suffering. Now, when they recall the events of the past eight years, they still feel lingering sadness. Therefore, today, they do not feel any interest in Yun Ze's advocacy of autonomy." Madame Damiling Sulong used this passage as her initial confession when discussing the current Inner Mongolian autonomy. She said that on August 10th of the thirty-fourth year [of the Republic], when De Wang left Zhangjiakou, over seven hundred Mongolian compatriots automatically organized a Mongolian fellow-villagers association to maintain the safety of the lives and property of the Mongolians. On August 23rd, Yun Ze entered Zhangyuan with the communist army and, under the orders of the communist army headquarters, went to the Mongolian fellow-villagers association to carry out activities, incite young people, and win over princes. On November 21st, he convened the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Movement Joint Conference, which established an executive committee and a standing committee, with five departments under its jurisdiction: organization, military affairs, propaganda, women, and youth, as well as a secretariat. Attached to it were the Mongolian Newspaper Office, the Mongolian Health Bureau, the Mongolian Industrial Company, and the Mongolian Academy. Each league, banner, and military district had branches and sub-branches. The chairman of the standing committee, the minister of military affairs, the chairman of the board of directors of the industrial company, and the president of the Mongolian Academy were all held by Yun Ze alone. Other organizations were also controlled by communist party members: (1) Secretary-General Liu Chun (communist), Director of the Secretariat Liu Jingping (communist), Chief of Staff Changdu Guleng, Minister of Organization Kui Bi (communist), Deputy Minister Gao Buzhabu (communist), Minister of Propaganda Huang Jing (communist), Minister of Women Min Zhong (communist), Director of the Health Bureau Hu Erqin Bilige, President of the Mongolian Newspaper Yong Fu (communist), Manager of the Industrial Company Zhao Yunshi (communist), Deputy Manager Guan Qiyi (communist). (2) Education Director of the Mongolian Academy Zhu Rong (communist), Director of the Administrative Department Su Jing (communist), Director of the Military Department Han Feng (communist). (3) Commander of the First Detachment Li Xiushan, Political Commissar Han Feng (communist), stationed in Habuga. Commander of the Second Detachment Li You-tong, approximately four divisions, in the Wangye Temple Hailar area of ​​the Northeast. Commander of the Third Detachment Hai Fulong, Commander of the Fourth Detachment in northern Chahar Uleji Aosu'er, roaming in eastern Suiyuan and northern Chahar. (4) League Leader of the Chahar League Chen Bingyu (communist), Deputy League Leader Haswazir, Director of the Branch Su Jianxiao (communist). League Leader of the Ulanqab League Moergen Batu, Deputy League Leader and Director of the Branch Yun Yili (communist). League Leader of the Bayannur League and Director of the Branch Kui Bi (communist). League Leader of the Xilingol League Song Wang, Deputy League Leader and Director of the Branch Hao Xin (communist). Among these people, after something, the Mongolians took all their carts, horses, cattle, sheep, and tents with them, leaving behind only women, children, and old men. Therefore, Uleji Aosu'er abducted more than 10,000 strong men to Inner Mongolia, but only over two hundred soldiers were equipped with Russian-style equipment and returned to Inner Mongolia with him. The rest all ran away along the way, and the remaining ones were opening mines in the deep mountains west of Kulun. The family members left behind in De Wang's mansion were separated from their wives and children and spent their days begging. Many froze to death on the grasslands in the winter before last and last year. Many Han people, their work did not extend to all places, because the National Army recovered Zhangjiakou in October last year, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Joint Conference was disintegrated.

On May 20th of this year, the red elements in the eastern and western parts of Inner Mongolia, after obtaining a combined attack with Outer Mongolia, convened a national congress in Wangye Temple, Liaobei Province, and decided to establish the Inner Mongolia People's Autonomous Government, with Yun Ze recommended by Mao Zedong as chairman and concurrently Minister of Foreign Affairs, Boyan Mandu as vice chairman, Ha Fengga as secretary-general, Qi Monan as minister of youth training, Kui Bi as minister of people's organization, Li Youtong as minister of military affairs, Asi Gen as minister of internal affairs, Temur Bagen as minister of economic affairs, and Namus Lai Zabu as minister of justice. The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Government currently has three corps. The commander of the Eastern Mongolian Corps is Qi Wenlin, who claims to have ten divisions, but the actual strength is 40,000 to 50,000 men, but weapons are supplied by a certain party. The Xicha Ba-U two corps were commanded by Uleji Aosu, with more than 5,000 people organized into seven divisions. Uleji Aosu'er himself concurrently served as the commander of the 11th Division, Ba Haiming as the commander of the 12th Division, Nao Ben Dalai as the commander of the 13th Division, Li Sheng as the commander of the 14th Division, Yun Jizhen as the commander of the 15th Division, Li Xiushan as the commander of the 16th Division, and Hai Fulong as the commander of the 17th Division. The troops in Eastern Mongolia were all pseudo-troops of the "Manchukuo", and the troops in Western Mongolia were all pseudo-troops of the "Mengjiang Government". Although they are united on the surface, the boundary between east and west is distinct, and within Western Mongolia, there are also rifts between Xicha and Bayannur. It is said that Eastern Mongolia is directly commanded and supplied by a certain party, while Western Mongolia is commanded and supplied by the CCP. Within the pseudo-government, Ha Fengga has the greatest power. Since Qi Daofu's death, he has led the Inner Mongolia Youth Revolutionary Party. Guo Hannan, Li Youtong, Guo Wenlin, and others are all his cadres. Yun Ze is just serving as a puppet. He is often not in Wangye Temple, but is now in Beizi Temple. The young people in Western Mongolia are drifting with him, very discouraged and disappointed. Many have recently escaped to Zhangjiakou.

Madame Damiling Sulong and her second son, Da Jinyi, went to northern Chahar from Twelve Sumu in July last year because they feared that the communist army in eastern Suiyuan would settle accounts, and they took refuge in Ulan Naori, East Sunit Banner, for over a year. In order to win over Damiling Sulong, their property had not suffered any major losses. However, the Mongolian rich in the vicinity were all impoverished by the communist army, and the poor were generally plunged into famine because no one hired them to graze cattle and sheep. The princes of the various banners of the Xilingol League were either taken to Outer Mongolia or fled to Zhangjiakou, and the area was in a state of anarchy. Anyone with thirty or fifty guns could roam around. The communist army in Western Mongolia, who had been accustomed to living in cities and villages during De Wang's time, felt very awkward returning to the ancient grasslands. People from the Chahar and Xilingol Leagues went to Jehol to find Li Shou-hsin, while people from the Bayannur and Urat Leagues returned home one after another. This time, Chief Fu sent a motorized regiment and Ouyou San's cavalry from the Suiyuan Security Division to suppress the bandits in northern Chahar, and they have already defeated the Bayannur-Urat military region. Yun Jizhen, the commander of the 15th Division, was captured, and Hai Chenglong was left with more than 100 people. Uleji Aosu'er and Kang Jianmin's brigade from the Suiyuan Military Region of the communist army had jointly established a base in Hugermiao, West Sunit Banner. Since the year before last, they have not received assistance from Outer Mongolia, and since Kang Jianmin withdrew to Shanxi, he has not come to northern Chahar for more than three months. Therefore, Uleji Aosu'er saw that he could not gain a foothold near De Wang's mansion, and went to Abaga Left Banner to find Yun Ze in early June. Da Jinyi also told the reporter that Western Mongolia was Inner Mongolia under the former Qing Dynasty. In the second year of the Republic of China, when Outer Mongolia declared independence, Western Mongolia stood on the side of the country and fought against Jebtsundamba. Especially the Mongolian compatriots in Suiyuan Province were deeply influenced by Chief Fu. In the twenty-fifth year [of the Republic], they shattered De Wang's Mongolian Political Council in Bailingmiao with the Chahar-Suiyuan division. During the War of Resistance against Japan and the suppression of bandits, the people of Suiyuan and Mongolia mostly supported the government. Therefore, Western Mongolia did not gain the trust of a certain party and Outer Mongolia. If Chief Fu often sent troops to garrison in northern Chahar, the treasonous flames of the Mongolian bandits would definitely be limited to Eastern Mongolia and could not spread to Western Mongolia. In fact, Suiyuan and Mongolia have already been stabilized, and the banditry in Chahar and Mongolia is also nearing its end. Madame Guo Zengxiang, the wife of Damiling Sulong, came from a noble family in Manchuria. Her son, Da Jinyi, graduated from junior high school and has excellent Chinese skills.

Escaped from the Tiger's Mouth

Madame Damiling Sulong and her son entered the communist area of ​​northern Chahar from Twelve Sumu, partly because they feared that the communist army in eastern Suiyuan would settle accounts, and partly because they wanted to inquire about Damiling Sulong's whereabouts and also attempted to preserve the weapons of their eighty-odd guards. They lived in East Sunit Banner for eight or nine months. Uleji Aosu'er never told them the correct news in a roundabout way, and planned to confiscate their guns. After despairing, they conceived the idea of ​​escaping. On the eighteenth day of the third lunar month of this year, Da Jinyi secretly returned to Guisui first to express his attitude to Chairman Dong, and then returned to Ulan Naori to gather cattle and sheep. On the seventeenth day of last month, taking advantage of the opportunity that Chief Fu sent a motorized regiment to eliminate the Mongolian communists in northern Chahar, they were taken to Xinmin County, near Shangdu, by the support troops of the Zhenghuang Banner. Along with them, more than fifty Mongolian households from East Sunit Banner also escaped. The Zhenghuang Banner has allocated grasslands to allow these people who have lost their tents to graze cattle and sheep.

Welcoming Madame Da and her son's return was the anti-civil-disorder vanguard team of the Zhenghuang Banner. Such troops exist in all eighteen Mongolian banners in Suiyuan, and their aim is to eliminate sporadic communist bandits. In the recent two or three months, the food supply for Madame Da's people and horses has entirely depended on the secret transportation of the anti-civil-disorder vanguard team of the Zhenghuang Banner. Because the Mongolians in the communist area deeply hate the treacherous bandits, they never reported Madame Da's dealings with eastern Suiyuan to Uleji Aosu'er. The commander of the anti-civil-disorder vanguard team of the Zhenghuang Banner, with the Chinese name Ren Desheng, served as a company commander under Damiling Sulong. This time, he led more than forty soldiers, not only escorting Madame Da and the refugees from East Sunit Banner to eastern Suiyuan, but also, on the way to Ulan Naori, passing through Abgaitushan in West Sunit Banner, killed Monk Jileger, the chairman of the communist army's Bayannur-Urat working committee. That person had studied in the Soviet Union and served as the pseudo-Zhenghong Banner chief administrator when the communist army occupied eastern Suiyuan.

The Mongolians originally thought that the CCP rebellion was an internal affair of the Han people. In the recent two years, they have realized that the communists of the whole world are one family. Although the Mongolian communists have not yet implemented a liquidation policy, they know that as long as they are militarily successful, the local bullies and ruffians will immediately rise up to overthrow and struggle, just as Outer Mongolia only declared independence and did not implement communism. After Jebtsundamba was assassinated, the people's misfortune followed. Madame Damiling Sulong's original departure from eastern Suiyuan was not necessarily to escape the war between the Kuomintang and the communists, but later she felt that the quagmire was getting deeper and deeper, and her husband and eldest son had been captured. Her second son also had the possibility of following in his father and brother's footsteps. So she quickly escaped from the sea of ​​suffering. Now, Madame Da turns pale at the mention of the Communist Party. She told the reporter that she plans to send her second son to Peiping to continue his studies in the second half of the year. She also does not dare to return to Twelve Sumu and plans to live in Jining County to manage her family affairs. Now, the Mongolians near the Outer Mongolian border are moving to the vicinity of Daqingshan. Wu of the Siziwang Banner, Shabei Zi of the Darhan Banner, and Qi Qingkang, the recorded Jasak of the Zangmengan Banner, have been living in Guisui as absentee landlords since the Japanese surrendered.

### The Vigilance That Labor Unions Should Have Against the Communist Party

— Original work by D. Dubinsky, President of the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union of America, specially translated by this newspaper's translation department

In any country, the activities of the Communist Party within labor unions not only affect the organized labor movement but also cause significant harm to the welfare and tranquility of the people.

The Communist Party is omnipresent. Under central command, they infiltrate church groups, educational institutions, women's clubs, scientific societies, and even merchant associations. However, labor unions have always been their special target. If they cannot control labor unions, the Communist Party will fail. Labor unions are their economic cornerstone; if they cannot command worker groups, all other connections will lose their effectiveness. Labor organizations are the largest and most important non-governmental groups in society. They are an integral part of the intricate mechanism of modern life.

The House of Labor

The Communist Party's activities within labor unions are of great significance. They bore into the "house of labor" like termites. However, due to the discrepancy between their totalitarian spirit and aims and the ideals and policies of free unionism, they have not yet become the main part of labor organizations.

Free unionism may have its shortcomings, but these shortcomings can be remedied because the procedures of labor unions, although sometimes not entirely in line with ideals, are democratic in spirit.

However, the Communism that infiltrates labor unions and other organizations is conspiratorial. Its basic policy is to eliminate the rule of majority and aims to establish a one-party dictatorship, with labor unions serving as stepping stones to achieving this goal.

Special Agents

The Communist Party's method of seizing control of labor unions is simple: Party special agents first identify a union member they intend to seize, engage with them, and then gradually win over a small number of like-minded members. With the assistance of the special agents, they devise a plan suitable for the Communist Party's platform.

Initially, the party representative singles out a union member who has some knowledge of procedural matters, and then sets the stage to introduce the unknowing member to an important official or a well-known party spokesperson, and takes them to various cocktail parties and dances.

Next comes the activity during labor union meetings. Before the meeting has officially started, the Communist Party "elements" begin to act. An unknowing member first proposes a motion, followed by debate, often extending late into the night. Members who want to go to bed early gradually slip out of the meeting, and the Communists gain an advantage. As a result of the vote, they finally achieve victory.

The Communist Party cannot act alone and must be assisted. They must become a crowd, a part of a "united front" or a "people's front." Because they are skilled in meeting techniques and because they do not hesitate to use any means or avoid any deception, they are always able to rush ahead.

However, the Communist Party "elements" do not necessarily nominate party members to occupy the position of union chairman. They can find a non-Communist with potential who is amenable and gentle to serve as the nominal chairman, as a cover for actually controlling the labor union. Of course, practical positions such as secretary, accountant, and organization minister must belong to Communist Party members.

A Smokescreen

The entire structure of the Communist Party is highly centralized, the so-called "democratic centralism." But this is just a smokescreen. Their organization is prepared for rapid action because when the party's policies are handed down, blind military discipline must be followed absolutely, without room for debate, only "discussion and approval."

The Communist Party boasts of being the "vanguard" of labor, which is completely deceptive. In reality, they often destroy many labor unions through factional struggles. They call themselves "progressives," but in fact, they are "violent reactionaries," as some have called them.

In their view, ethics and morality are merely "bourgeois" virtues. Therefore, within the labor union, even a conservative or reactionary element will be supported as long as they can approve of pro-Soviet or pro-Communist policies.

Totalitarian Color

It is clear that pro-Communist elements have been able to make progress among the labor masses due to the vanity and lack of integrity of non-Communist labor union members. And opportunism is a common trait.

Even in our international union, any local official, no matter how conservative or incompetent, can avoid criticism from the Communist Party and even gain their support as long as they support resolutions favorable to Soviet foreign policy or Communist Party policies.

In the Communist Party's view, the measure of a labor union leader's "progressive color" is not whether his labor policies are sound, but whether he is willing to agree with Soviet policies. This is why I consider the Communist Party to be totalitarian reactionaries.

In fact, truly progressive labor leaders are most often attacked by these leftist elements, while conservative labor leaders remain unscathed. The reason is simple: Liberal unionists understand the history and conspiracies of the Communist Party and cannot be deceived by them. The International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union has been under attack by the Communist Party for many years for this very reason.

Control Methods

The Communist Party often works day and night, desperately trying to control progressive labor unions. With these labor unions as their base, they can launch offensives against more conservative union strongholds. Once they control a number of progressive unions, their power extends into the core and decision-making bodies of the entire labor movement. This means that the Communist Party has representatives participating in various committees and groups, can meet with the President, have access to important government departments, and approach secret intelligence and deliver it to party committees.

I do not deny that the Communist Party sometimes struggles to improve the status of labor. But they are only willing to do so when such policies do not conflict with the interests of the Soviet rulers. If they believe that abandoning demands on employers, ignoring the suffering of workers, or engaging in maximum "class cooperation" is beneficial to them, they will do so.

Various Consequences

What would be the consequences if the Communist Party were to control the American labor union movement?

Let us cite the words of the famous Soviet labor union leader Tomsky to answer this question: "If there is a time we can imagine that all the labor unions in Germany will march shoulder to shoulder with the German Communist Party tomorrow, then we can determine that within five minutes of the combination of these two major forces, a Soviet government will be established... If there is a time we can imagine that the British labor unions and the Communist Party combine, then a Soviet government will also be quickly established in Britain."

It is clear that the success of the Communist Party in seizing various positions and gaining control of labor unions is not only related to the labor organization itself but also has a close relationship with the entire country.

Today's France is a prominent and tragic example. The French Communist Party now dominates the General Confederation of Labor. Undoubtedly, the French Communist Party's appeal to voters is mostly due to their control over the metal industry, coal industry, transportation industry, and other major labor organizations.

If one day the Communist Party has the same control over the American labor union movement and thus obtains the same decisive political position, then the United States, at the mercy of a ruthless foreign totalitarian dictatorship, will feel the same unease and danger, and the independence of the country will be severely threatened.

Need for Vigilance

Some believe that the Communist Party is skilled in organizational skills, which is completely absurd. The strong will of progressive and democratic forces within labor unions can defeat them. Our experience in the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union has repeatedly proven this point.

In a recent election held by a branch of the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union with 25,000 members, there were fewer than 500 self-identified or known Communist Party members. However, due to their activities, propaganda, and rumor-mongering tactics, they surprisingly obtained more than 5,000 votes as a result of the voting. Assuming that only 9,000 members actually participated in the voting, then fewer than 500 Communist Party members could control a branch with such a large membership. Fortunately, the progressive forces were vigilant, led effectively, and were able to mobilize 80% of the members to participate in the voting, enabling them to defeat the forces led by the Communist Party by a ratio of three to one.

Work Guidelines

Therefore, progressive elements of labor unions, in order to deal with this situation, must do the following:

(1) We should work as hard to organize the majority of members within the labor union as the Communist Party does to organize the minority of members.

(2) Enlightened unionists do not need to prevent Communist Party infiltration by prohibiting Communist Party propaganda. Eliminating the Communist Party's position on the political stage or prohibiting Communist Party members from joining the labor union is not an effective way to compete with the Communist Party. We must rely on education and discuss various labor issues daily.

(3) We must do our best to make the labor masses fully understand the importance of attending meetings and taking on responsibilities. We must take the lead in solving the pain in stores and factories. Because if progressive union members do not participate in these tasks, the Communist Party will take over to achieve their goals.

(4) In order to ensure that the resolutions of the labor union truly reflect the will of the majority, each branch should require its members to attend all meetings and participate in all elections, thereby preventing the Communist Party from controlling the labor union with a minority.

(5) As labor union leaders, we must lead by example, work hard, and strive to solve daily labor problems, such as improving working conditions, raising living standards, and protecting political rights.

(6) Active labor leaders should not engage in empty rhetoric and compete with the Communist Party.

If we follow these guidelines, we will not find it difficult to defeat the forces occupied by the Communist Party in the labor union each time we compete with them. These Communist Party bacteria, like other germs, are most likely to grow in darkness and ignorance. They will not breed in labor unions where leaders and members are vigilant, loyal, and capable.

In central Shaanxi, at the Xuan Yuan Yellow Emperor Temple, there is an ancient cypress tree, tall and strong beyond measure, said to have been planted by King Jing of Zhou. Its circumference can be embraced by eight people, standing out as unique. It is a pity that the inscription on the stele has been eroded by the wind for a long time, and this ancient tree cannot be identified or verified. (Reported by our reporter Zhang Xianzhou)

### Island of Fiber - A Glimpse into the Paper Industry

— Ling Feng

Aeronautical report from Taipei, 12th

Accompanying the decline of Chinese culture, the paper industry in China has also been underdeveloped. The Northeast paper industry, which was relatively large-scale under Japanese management, was ruthlessly destroyed after the war. The Tianjin paper mill is said to be about to be auctioned off. Currently, the most promising paper industry is probably the Taiwan Paper Industry Corporation, which is jointly operated by the Assets Committee and the Taiwan Provincial Government. This cannot be denied.

Taiwan has always been very developed in papermaking because of its abundant raw materials. In the past, during the Japanese era, the emphasis was on sugarcane pulp production because Taiwan's sugar industry was unparalleled in the Far East, with an inexhaustible supply of bagasse that could be utilized. Among them, the Tainan factory (formerly Yanshuigang Pulp Company) had the largest output, producing 100 tons of sugarcane pulp per day. The Taipei factory (formerly Luodong Taiwan Xingye Co., Ltd.) mainly produced Western paper, with a daily output of 48 tons. The Shilin factory (formerly Taiwan Paper Manufacturing Co., Ltd.) produced 20 tons of paperboard per day. The above output far exceeded the needs of the province, and the surplus of paper relied mostly on foreign exports for adjustment. For example, pulp was mostly transported back to Japan for paper processing in the past, some Western paper was transported to coastal areas of our country, and paperboard was mainly transported to Nanyang, Northeast China, and North China, which had gained a very good reputation. After the restoration, the paper industry company's various paper mills continued to operate under the separate supervision of the receiving personnel, but during the war, the factories were destroyed, raw materials were scarce, and machinery and equipment could not be replenished, so the output was drastically reduced, and it could not be measured in terms of distance compared with the past.

Last May, the paper industry company was officially established, and it took over the various factories, buried itself in restoration work, repaired and purchased, and tried to increase production in every way. However, the most difficult thing was the lack of felt and copper wire mesh. The old ones were full of holes and were really unbearable for reuse, while the new ones ordered from abroad were slow to arrive, which affected production significantly. At present, a batch of the ordered equipment has finally been delivered one after another, and all five factories under its jurisdiction have been able to resume production. In the future, the increase in Taiwan's paper industry is really a very promising industry in China. The following is the recent production and sales situation of each factory of the company:

From January to May: The Taipei factory produced a total of 1,091 tons of Western paper (including newsprint and printing paper) and sold 909 tons.

The Shilin factory produced a total of 1,751 tons of paperboard and sold 1,263 tons.

The Taichung factory produced a total of 626 tons of Western paper and sold 446 tons.

The Tainan factory produced a total of 70,988 sheets of sugarcane board and sold 13,180 sheets.

The Kaohsiung factory produced a total of 13 tons of Western paper.

The total sales proceeds of the above amounted to more than 200 million legal tender dollars, and the paperboard and woodfree printing paper shipped to Shanghai were worth approximately 2 billion dollars.

In order to increase production and expand sales, the paper industry company has formulated a plan for the future. It is estimated that the monthly production of newsprint will be 200 tons, printing paper 750 tons, wrapping paper 100 tons, bag paper 200 tons, yellow paperboard 400 tons, white paperboard 200 tons, and pulp 1,250 tons. In addition to sales within the province, it is planned to sell 425 tons of printing paper, 80 tons of bag paper, and 30 tons of wrapping paper to the Beijing-Shanghai area. 150 tons each of yellow and white paperboard, 900 tons of pulp; sell 100 tons of printing paper and 50 tons of yellow paperboard to South China; and sell 100 tons of yellow paperboard to Nanyang. If this plan can be completed, Taiwan's paper industry will naturally exert a greater force in contributing to China's cultural cause. The general manager of the paper industry company is Dr. Xie Hui, an old professor from Jiaotong University. His hair is already gray, but he is biting a pipe, and his spirit is as vigorous as a young man. He said that he will do everything possible to promote the realization of this plan.

### Guangzhou's Progress on the Road to Rebirth After the System Change

— Liang Feng, Special Correspondent of This Newspaper

Aeronautical report from the 17th

Due to the severity of the floods throughout the province, an atmosphere of gloom is shrouding the entire city of Guangzhou. Almost every one of the million-plus citizens has a heavy weight on their hearts because this unprecedented disaster in the past 30 years has directly or indirectly affected every citizen! At this time, there is only one piece of exciting news, and that is that Guangzhou has been approved to be restored as a municipality directly under the Executive Yuan. Although this is only an administrative system change, the city has been upgraded, the city government officials have also been promoted, and the status of the citizens seems to have been upgraded accordingly. Although being a citizen of a special municipality is not necessarily more prestigious than being an ordinary citizen, everyone always thinks that Guangzhou will have slightly more adequate government funds in the future after the system change, and it can also hope for direct subsidies from the central government to carry out various constructions that benefit the citizens. Everyone is looking forward to a vision of building a new Guangzhou, which is so beautiful and brilliant. Therefore, everyone is focusing their efforts on providing disaster relief to the victims on the one hand and enthusiastically celebrating the success of Guangzhou's system change on the other hand, making this gloomy atmosphere suddenly clear.

Citizens' Expectations - Guangzhou's Rebirth

Originally, Guangzhou was the largest city in South China, occupying an important position in the economy, culture, society, and internationally. The population has also exceeded one million, and it is also the revolutionary base with a glorious history. It already has all the conditions of a special municipality. However, after the restoration, because it was a provincial-level city, the city treasury's income was limited, and the subsidy for restoration and construction costs was far from that of a special municipality, making it difficult to carry out all municipal facilities. In the past two years, although the authorities have made careful plans, it is probably due to economic reasons that many plans cannot be implemented or cannot be thoroughly implemented. This is like a person who is malnourished, showing an unhealthy state everywhere. Objectively speaking, to this day, all municipal facilities have really failed to meet the demands of the citizens. Let's see: prices continue to rise, now catching up with the Beijing-Shanghai area, the housing shortage is still a serious problem, the number of armed robberies has not decreased compared to before, electric lights are dim, telephones are not working, roads are uneven, and unclean tap water are still the same, and there is no improvement. In particular, the so-called "shuxing" (meaning bribes) atmosphere left over from the enemy-puppet era has always been impossible to eliminate. The police can openly collect "shuxing" fees from vendors, and even when citizens report to the Public Works Bureau to build houses, they deliberately create difficulties. The existence of all these stains naturally has many factors. The authorities naturally have considerable difficulties. Therefore, the general public can only hope that these unsatisfactory realities will become a thing of the past from now on, and everyone will sincerely wait for the rebirth of Guangzhou to arrive!

The Mayor's Handling of Matters - Stable and Serious

The mayor of Guangzhou after the system change is still the original mayor, Ouyang Ju, and there has not been much change in personnel, which is something that the citizens are happy about. Because this way, all the original plans can be thoroughly implemented, without hindering the implementation due to personnel changes. Mayor Ouyang is from Zhongshan, Guangdong, and graduated from the 6th term of the Baoding Military Academy. He participated in the revolution in his early years and served as deputy commander of the Independent 1st Division of the National Revolutionary Army, commander of the 17th Division, commander of the Humen Fortress, director of the Guangdong Provincial Capital Police Bureau, deputy commander-in-chief of the Guangdong-Jiangxi-Fujian Border Area, and member and secretary-general of the Guangdong Provincial Government. He naturally has considerable experience in doing things, especially his excellent construction of Guangzhou's police affairs during his tenure as police chief, which is still praised by the general public. Probably because he is a military man, his temper is a bit impatient, but he is kind and friendly to people, and he is very serious about things and does not allow for any carelessness. Moreover, he emphasizes practicality and does not like empty talk. Therefore, on the day of Guangzhou's system change, he specifically stated to reporters that he is a pragmatist and that his future administration will prioritize what the citizens urgently need, and he will never be afraid of difficulties, let alone shirk responsibility. The meaning is that everything will be expressed through facts, and there is no need to announce any great plans in advance, so as to avoid becoming an empty check that cannot be cashed out in the future if it cannot be realized, and instead be criticized by everyone. From this point alone, it can be seen that he is stable and serious in handling matters!

The City Government's New Initiatives - Main Content

In fact, although Mayor Ouyang has never announced his new plan, according to the reporter's investigation from all sides, all municipal construction is indeed actively underway. The important contents are roughly the following:

(1) Reorganizing the Disaster Area and Restoring Construction: Because Guangzhou has experienced eight years of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the disaster area is vast, resulting in a more serious housing shortage. Now the Land Administration Bureau has a complete plan to thoroughly reorganize, remeasure the disaster area, delineate boundaries, and submit it to the Urban Construction Committee for review and approval within a short period of time, and then announce it to each original owner for claiming and reconstruction. If the owners are unable to build, the government will first raise funds for construction, and after the disaster area is restored and prosperous, the owners will share the reimbursement. After this plan is successful, not only will the housing shortage problem be solved, but the prosperity of the city will be increased a hundredfold.

(2) Developing the Xicun and Henan Industrial Zones: Since the restoration, Guangzhou's industry has been in a slump due to foreign goods dumping, lack of raw material sources, and high wages, and the number of unemployed people is increasing day by day. Therefore, the authorities are now formulating a plan to designate Xicun as a heavy industrial zone and Henan as a light industrial zone, and encourage overseas Chinese to invest and set up businesses, and will give them considerable protection. If it is realized, the city's production and construction can be increased, and the unemployed people can also be relieved, and society will be more stable.

(3) Developing Shipping and Opening the Inner Port: Guangzhou is a transportation port in South China, and there are more and more ships coming and going. It is now actively carrying out the opening of the inner port to facilitate the development of shipping on various rivers, and it is estimated that it will be completed within six months.

(4) Separately Reorganizing Public Utilities: Public utilities in Guangzhou, such as electric lights, telephones, and tap water, have never been perfect, as mentioned above. Now, because the city government's application to the Central Bank for a loan of 10 billion has been successful, and 4 billion yuan has been allocated to improve water and electricity, it is now being actively reorganized separately. At the same time, transportation is also being improved. The promotion of tricycles has also received considerable results, and the continued construction of roads and the improvement of streets are all being actively planned.

Overseas Chinese's Large Investment in Guangdong

In addition to the above, there is also better news, that is, recently, overseas Chinese in the Nanyang archipelago and Singapore have voluntarily invested heavily in Guangzhou's construction projects. Initiated and raised by overseas Chinese leaders in Singapore, the initial estimated amount is 150 billion yuan. Their plans have also been formulated, preparing to build 26 of the latest model large markets with equipment in various districts of the city, and to build three wharves in the Henan Inner Port that can berth 10,000 to 15,000-ton ships, and three new-style large warehouses. The drawings of the various buildings are now being actively prepared. If this plan can be realized, these 26 markets alone are estimated to be able to solve the business and livelihood problems of more than 100,000 street vendors, and the appearance of the city will also be renewed at that time!

Indeed, all municipal construction after Guangzhou's system change is being actively planned and carried out! Because Mayor Ouyang is a practical person. We should believe that building a new Guangzhou will not just be a slogan!

### Reader Consultation

Legal Clarification

Lovers are cousins but cannot be married

This newspaper's reader, Mr. Zhen Shayun, wrote in a letter. His friend, Mr. Huang, is very loyal and usually taciturn. He is now approaching the age of thirty, but recently, he has been frowning all day long. After inquiring again and again, he learned that Mr. Huang fell in love with his cousin during last year's summer vacation. The seeds of love were deeply buried, and they discussed marriage with each other. However, due to traditional teachings, it is almost impossible for the two to get married. Therefore, he is depressed and unhappy. Mr. Zhen also raised several legal questions as follows: (1) Is there any explicit legal provision on marriage between cousins? Mr. Huang and his cousin are cousins of the same lineage. Can they be allowed to marry as an exception? (2) Suppose they proceed with the marriage regardless of legal restrictions, is it illegal? Can others accuse Mr. Huang of inducement or other crimes? (3) If both parties are adults and get married, can others hinder them? (4) Cousins and relatives by marriage have the same bloodline. Why do people today support marriage between relatives by marriage but oppose marriage between cousins?

[Lawyer Chuan Kuanglin's answer] (1) Article 983 of the Civil Code stipulates that direct relatives by marriage and collateral relatives by blood shall not marry. (2) The marriage is legally invalid, and the legal representative may file a lawsuit with the court to revoke the marriage if it violates Article 980 of the Civil Code. (3) Others have no right to interfere. (4) The law also restricts marriage between collateral blood relatives of the same generation within eight degrees of kinship, except for cousins.

### Four Suggestions for Maritime Safety

Editor: I am a reader of your newspaper who travels between Shanghai and Chongming Island and must take ships. Seeing the sinking of the Datat Transportation ship, I feel a sense of danger and cannot remain silent. I have a few suggestions that I hope the authorities will adopt: (1) The competent authorities should regularly inspect machinery. If it does not meet navigation standards, the business should be ordered to suspend operations immediately and resume only after improvements are made. (2) The number of tickets sold should be based on the ship's tonnage and must not be exceeded. Violators should be prosecuted according to the law. (3) More life-saving equipment should be provided. (4) Crew members must be tested, as the Datong ship crew's failure to recognize warning flags led to the disaster. The lesson of the past is not far off, and misfortunes are frequent. Please pay attention. (Chen Zhi Chang, Yangshupu Road)

### A Letter Answering Readers: On the New Literary Thought Trend of China

— Zhao Qing Ge

Mr. Rong:

Shen Zhan forwarded your letter and another letter from Mr. Rangzhe. Your contents are similar. You are not only concerned about me but also about the dynamics of China's new literary thought trend. This moves me very much because you are so enthusiastic about literature! In order not to disappoint your enthusiasm, I am willing to correspond with you even in this humid and hot weather. But this is not my laziness. To avoid writing separate letters to you, I am hereby responding publicly in a comprehensive way. It may seem disorganized, but the theme will not go beyond the realm of "literature."

You said that the development history of China's new literary thought trend in the past thirty years seems to have been lifted and carried by European and American literary thought trends, from Oscar Wilde's aestheticism to Emile Zola, Guy de Maupassant, Honore de Balzac's naturalism and realism, to the new romanticism and new realism of recent New Russia. I do not deny that this series of changes in literary thought trends has indirectly and successively influenced the evolution of China's new literary thought trend; but I can deny that they are the authority that "lifted and carried" the evolution of China's new literary thought trend. We know that the changes in European and American literary thought trends are also driven by the mainstream of global thought. China's new literary thought trend is also directly driven and evolved under such a law, adapting to the needs of the times. How can the influence of European and American literary thought trends alone be effective? From this, we should understand that the new literary thought movement in China in the past thirty years is independent and not promoted by European and American literary thought trends. To speak more broadly, Don Quixote, a famous European work of the early 18th century, is still a literary masterpiece, as you said, and the Yuan dynasty Chinese writer Shi Nai'an had already written the masterpiece "Water Margin," which reflects the social conditions and people's thoughts of the time, and has been circulating to this day. At that time, it could not be said to be influenced by European and American literary thought trends! It was a product of that era, proving that China's literary thought trend had independently laid the foundation for evolution hundreds of years ago. Therefore, I must ask you to recognize that China's literary thought trend has its own splendid history and its evolution is natural and not opened up or even "lifted and carried" by European and American literary thought trends. Especially after World War II, the entire world's thought evolved from capitalism and powerism to democracy, and the literary thought trend also leaped to democracy. The credit for promoting the awakening of the world lies in China's War of Resistance against Japan. Therefore, we can say that the latest historical page in the evolution of world literary thought trends was revealed by China.

As for what you said about the quantity and quality of Chinese literary works expressing literary thought trends, it is still only an "infant less than a month old," I admit that, especially today when the world war has just ended and is still catching its breath. Chinese literature is waiting to be revived and constructed, and it is also in the midst of domestic turmoil. It has never been easy for Chinese literary writers to write in a difficult living environment. Now the living environment is even more difficult, with double oppression of material and spirit, unlike European and American literary writers, whose countries provide them with life security and the right to freely express their thoughts. Then, I ask, what conditions can a poor Chinese literary writer rely on to produce literary works that satisfy themselves and others? I am not trying to protect or quibble for Chinese literary writers, this is a fact! I dare say that if Upton Sinclair and Romain Rolland were born in China, no matter how talented they were, they would probably not be able to produce works like those they produced in Europe and America. Therefore, most Chinese literary writers are now passive; although there are a few who are still struggling and fighting with reality, they are ultimately weak and insufficient to accomplish the great cause of revival and construction. Naturally, this should be sad, but this is by no means the fault of literary writers. At present, literary writers have become sentimental and melancholy and cannot write good works. In order to make a living, they have to write, so they only write about things that are far from reality, such as drawing materials from history (like the performance of today's dramas, almost all of which are historical remakes), or tracing back some personal memories. I am such a literary writer. Therefore, three months ago, I received a letter from a reader in Peiping, who questioned why I only write sentimental works and advised me to write more articles that people need, that is, the voice representing the suffering of the people, and inject a cardiotonic into the people. I have not replied to this letter to this day. I know that he will misunderstand that I do not accept his good intentions and care, and he will be even more disappointed. But, how could he know how ashamed and mixed up I felt after reading his letter! How can I reply to him? Can I lie that I am not sentimental? I am sentimental! Can I promise him that I can write works that the people demand? But the environment will not allow me to write. So I can only not reply to the letter. I always remember the kindness of that reader. Although the things I write now have no content and are not active enough to express the evolution of literary thought trends, I am willing to swear to the readers who care about me that I will be loyal to literature and never be sloppy or crude in writing skills; I will never relax the pursuit of truth in the theme consciousness; and I will never abandon the banner of justice. Am I a purely literary worker of humanistic thought and liberalism? I would never dare to deceive myself or deceive the readers who care about me; because I admire literature, I live for literature! Not only me, many literary writers today are working and living in this state!

Now let us return to the topic and talk about the brief history of the development of China's new literary thought trend in the past thirty years and the trend of China's new literary thought trend today. But first, I would like you to establish a sense of self-esteem for Chinese literature and believe that the history of Chinese literary thought trend has its own evolving historical background and its own independent life. It was like this in the past, and it will still be like this in the future. It will never be simply transferred by the influence of European and American literary thought trends!

From the "May Fourth" Movement in 1919; to the "September 18th" Incident in 1925; to the "July 7th" War of Resistance in 1937; to the "September 3rd" victory in 1945, in this not short twenty-six years, Chinese new literature was influenced by internal and external politics, economy, society, and culture; literary thought trends have gone through these epoch-making historical evolutions, and have generated an undeniable driving force for the country and the people.

We can roughly divide the new Chinese literature of the past thirty years into three stages:

(1) The first stage - the "emerging literature" stage of anti-feudalism. The time is during the "May Fourth" Movement. Representative figures who advocated emerging literature were Mr. Hu Shi, Mr. Chen Duxiu, and Mr. Cai Yuanpei.

(2) The second stage - the "revolutionary literature" stage of anti-imperialism. The time is around the "September 18th" Incident. Representative figures who led the "revolutionary literature" were Mr. Lu Xun, Mr. Guo Moruo, Mr. Mao Dun, and Mr. Lao She.

(3) The third stage - the "national defense literature" stage of resisting the enemy and saving the nation, also known as the "national literature" stage. The time is during the "July 7th" War of Resistance. Representative figures who led the "national defense literature" were the national literary writers who participated in the War of Resistance.

These three stages have never left the door of struggle. Chinese literature has blossomed, borne fruit, and shone brilliantly in the process of these historical struggles! Literature lacking struggle has no vitality, that is, no center of gravity. Literature progresses and grows in struggle, and it is still like this now. The nature of this struggle, whether it is subjective - for the literary cause itself; or objective - for human society; its motivation belongs to a sense of justice. The worship of justice in literature is almost natural! Therefore, struggle becomes a necessary condition for literature. (The so-called "sense of justice" is just a pure and kind spiritual sense, not any political means. Some people say that a sense of justice is "left-leaning," which is really absurd. In fact, it is a moderate and upright attitude towards life that is neither left nor right.)

Under this general principle of struggle for "justice," literary thought trends are superficially "unified," but due to the different individual positions and concepts and the understanding of the times, there are constantly narrow and fragmented divisions and factions. This phenomenon is very obvious in each of the above three stages, and there is no special development. After the War of Resistance, various factions and gangs automatically disappeared. Under the call of the truth of resisting the enemy and saving the nation in the national literary circles, they unanimously united on one front. For eight years, literary writers have been shedding blood like armed comrades - their heart's blood. Coupled with the attack of poverty and disease, many lives have been sacrificed (whether they died in battle, in bombing, or from lung disease). But this is not enough to make literary writers depressed. Everyone is willing to vomit the last drop of their blood, and no one will be threatened by thousands of germs! Why? Because everyone has only one concept: that is, the country is supreme and the nation is supreme!

Thank God, the war is finally over. Literature and the world, like China, have been destroyed by the flames of war, and everyone is calling for revival! The trend of this great era guides the world and China together towards a peaceful construction mainstream. What is the peaceful construction mainstream? It is democracy! Democracy is a progressive strategy through the collective consciousness of all mankind! Its philosophical basis is the generosity of benevolence, righteousness, and morality. Selflessness is to synthesize the opinions of the majority, objectively identify them, and take their essence to replace them. Its ideology is transcendent, free, and only good and beautiful. Today, the world and China need unity, and democracy produces unity. Without unity, there is no way to be democratic. Conversely, without democracy, there is naturally no way to unite.

Literary thought trends change with today's political, economic, social, and cultural background. Under the driving force of a progressive world view, they undoubtedly tend towards transcendence and freedom. Whether it is for the literary cause itself or for human society, literature needs to promote a truly free ideological emotion. Express the basic spirit of democracy from the cultivation of learning and morality. The highest ideal of this basic spirit is the maintenance of justice and humanity. Therefore, democratic literature does not allow its thought trends to have fragmented phenomena again. Any existence of literary factions and the establishment of portals should be swallowed by the waves of the new era! Otherwise, literature will not be able to set off the power of its new life, nor will it be able to reflect objective reality, and generate a role in promoting the future evolution of politics, economy, society, and culture! Therefore, today's new literary thought trend can be called the "democratic literature" stage of peaceful construction.

Democratic literature should be the sign of the consciousness of today's literary writers. Literary writers should hold transcendent integrity and regard the free and democratic literary cause as the peaceful construction cause of the whole world and all mankind; and express the highest theme of their works from the wise pen of the writer. However, at this stage, literary writers must abandon the concept of position, grasp objective reality, truth is discovered, literature can get a new evaluation, literary revival will inevitably succeed, and the literary cause will inevitably radiate the most brilliant light eternally in history!

Dear reader, I don't know if you are satisfied with this reply to your question about the brief history of the development of China's new literary thought trend and the future direction of China's new literary thought trend? Simplicity may be inevitable, but please believe that I am very objective and sincere! I hope this letter can help you understand the natural formation of the evolution of China's new literary thought trend and its relationship with European and American literary thought trends more deeply. As for whether my personal views and analysis are correct, I am willing to discuss them again. I have absolutely no prejudice.

I will stop here. Thank you to all readers for your love and concern! (Night of 15th, July, 36th Year)

### Psyche

— Edward John Poynter

Edward John Poynter (1836-1919) specialized in watercolor paintings and murals, and served as the curator of major British art galleries. In 1896, he was appointed as the President of the Royal Academy.

The background and facial expressions of Psyche in this painting are captivating. Legend has it that Psyche was the wife of Cupid, the son of the goddess Venus. She loved Cupid, but was unwilling to obey him. Eventually, she could not bear the pain and reconciled with him. This picture depicts Psyche's psychology. (Xu Junmo)

### The Book Market in America

— Zhao Jingshen

The number of literary publications published in the United States every month is countless, and we really have no way to introduce them all, because most of them are still authors and works that have not been eliminated by time. Rather than talking about them, I would rather introduce some recent literary histories, literary theories, and reprints and analyses of literary masterpieces.

Sheed & Ward bookstore is preparing to publish a set of "Great Writers of the World." Each book will have a biography, textual evidence (including new translations), the era in which the writer lived, and his influence on the future. The first two types, "Horace" of Rome and "Boccaccio" of Italy, have been published, and "Rabelais," "Dante," and "Maupassant" will be published soon.

Freud's "Leonardo da Vinci" is now available in English translation. "The Selected Works of Stevenson" contains 1,200 pages, including short and long novels, essays, and poems, and each piece has no abridgments. These two books are published by Random House.

The University of Chicago Press has published a new translation of Pindar's short songs, and also published Richard M. Kain's "Fabulons Voyager." The latter specializes in explaining James Joyce's "Ulysses." We should not regard "Ulysses" as a mysterious work, it is just a human experience. Some critics scold this book for being obscene, and some praise his style, but neither can truly understand this modern "Divine Comedy." Kain pointed out symbols in the book that have never been pointed out before, and found that the author was actually attacking the failure of civilized morality.

Sidney Cox wrote a book "Indirections," which is a book about writing. The author has rich experience and knowledge, penetrating humanity, and the writing is also profound. The book has received unanimous praise after it was published. Published by Alfred A. Knopf bookstore.

Northrop Frye wrote a book "Fearful Symmetry," published by Princeton University Press. This is a monograph on William Blake, which can answer the author's poems. The author describes Blake's thoughts and poetry, and describes his religious views, views on life, and artistic views, the complex symbols in his poems, his relationship with contemporary British literature, and the true meaning of his poems.

John Gassner's "Best Plays of Modern American Theatre" has released its second collection, with seventeen complete scripts, beginning with an introduction that describes the development of American drama from 1939 to 1946, and each writer also has a biography and reference materials.

The Library Association has recently released several books: (1) Emerson's Essays. Apart from the Bible and Shakespeare, Emerson's words are quoted by the most people in ancient and modern times. (2) Bible Lost Texts, two volumes, 562 pages. (3) Chaucer's "Canterbury Tales", translated into modern language. (4) Joyce's "Ulysses", unabridged version. (5) Lawrence's "The First Lady Chatterley", this book is "Lady Chatterley's Lover". (5) The Complete Works of Shakespeare, including poetry and sonnets, a total of 1,527 pages, with 40 full pictures. (6) The most noteworthy is "The Complete Translation of One Thousand and One Nights", translated by Burton, with all his annotations and essays. There is also a complete index and 1,001 illustrations by Valenti Angelo. Three volumes, sold for US$17.48. The address of The Union Library Association is 121-123 East 24th Street, New York 10 N.Y..

### Two Topics in Essays

— Shi Jimei

Backstage

The embroidered curtain is slowly falling, and the touching music is sending the audience away.

A good show ended like this.

A friend invited me to visit the back together, and I happily agreed.

The carved railings and jade砌 buildings were originally these unshaped blocks and pieces of cloth? The magnificent flowers, trees, mountains, and forests were originally these colored papers and powder paintings? And that face with the greasepaint not yet wiped off, under the lights of the dressing room, is so ugly! Just now, the stage was also lit up, how beautiful and solemn it was?

Everything is different, but is it just these?

Look: that couple in love is now arguing about the "grabbing of words" just now, arguing until their faces are red; the filial son and loving mother in the play are also sulking for some reason; the good old man is scolding people; the naive girl is secretly flirting with the robber who robbed her in the play...

——So this is the backstage, how different!

I never thought that what was so beautiful in the front was so ugly in the back! I never thought...

Butterflies and Bees

Do you remember?

On a sunny day when birds sing and flowers are fragrant, bees are flying among the flowers, and butterflies are also flying among the flowers...

The butterfly said to the bee: "Play, take advantage of this golden spring."

The bee replied: "Because it is a golden spring, I cannot forget to brew honey."

"Good times don't last long, and good scenery is hard to repeat. You should remember to enjoy yourself in time."

"Good times don't last long, and good scenery is hard to repeat. I only know to work hard in time."

"One day, spring will be gone, and you will regret it."

"One day, spring will be gone, and you will regret it."

Truly one day: they met in another world.

"I wasted my youth." The bee regretted it.

"I wasted my youth." The butterfly also regretted it.

Dear, whether it is a butterfly or a bee, you can choose, you can arrange, but remember, in the future, don't regret it! Don't ever.

### An Inch of Mountain, An Inch of Blood 355

— Ye Jingfeng

Everyone at my level at the time had tried this "Zen skill," but no one had succeeded. Others had different experiences; in short, each person had a unique approach and explanation. As for me, I tried three times and twice ended up in a deep sleep, losing half a day in the blink of an eye, almost delaying my exams and catching the night train.

However, after taking on a position, I often felt mentally exhausted. Occasionally, I remembered this trick and practiced it with determination for some time, indeed gaining some insight. Since collaborating with Tsurumi, this method has become my unfailing remedy for chapped hands, a small skill with great use (?), truly achieving some effect. I even taught this method to Tsurumi, who reportedly also experienced "scattered benefits."

However, since the day I moved to Shanxi to begin drawing up plans, until I reached Changping, I was so busy and distracted that I couldn't even practice this "Zen skill" on time. Therefore, that night, Ding Yuan and Big Fool persuaded me to rest, and I had no choice but to accept. But as soon as I closed my eyes, I heard Liu Wu come in and say, "It's broad daylight, a young guest has arrived and is waiting to see you."

I opened my eyes and asked if it was really broad daylight. However, I felt like I had only just closed my eyes, realizing I had slept so soundly that I didn't even notice how quickly time had passed.

"A young guest?" I immediately thought it must be Little Tiger. "Quick, show him in!" I waved to Liu Wu and jumped out of bed.

"Uncle!" Little Tiger didn't wait for Liu Wu to leave before running into the inner room. "Uncle, I'm here!"

Not seeing this child for a few days felt like years. I looked him up and down and thought he seemed a bit taller. Immediately, I realized this was just a perceptual illusion; because I constantly thought of him as a child of only twelve or thirteen years old, and children naturally can't be too tall—according to the average child's height—with this preconception, seeing him again after a few days made me feel like he had grown taller.

He was still wearing the same outfit—a short-sleeved, open-necked shirt and Western-style long trousers—the shirt was off-white, and quite dirty, likely having not been changed in days, making it appear quite ragged. The trousers, though Western-style, had no visible straight seams, and if it weren't for the few buttons, two pockets, and turned-up cuffs, no one would recognize them as suit trousers.

As for the shoes he wore, they had a sense of "Minar flaps" and "kick-a-cow" described in old novels. Although these were Minar flaps, they were indeed a pair of imitation imported basketball high-top boots. Because they were old and he had run so much, the laces had stretched and torn the holes, and he was too lazy to re-lace them, giving the top of the boot a flapped appearance. The "kick-a-cow" description also had some truth to it; the soles and toes of the shoes had been patched several times, nailed with thick leather; this savage look certainly seemed capable of kicking a cow to death.

Logically, as an officer in the city, even a minor lieutenant, he should have a "salary," rations, and equipment. Why couldn't he get a pair of military leather shoes? This is a valid question. Little Tiger had grown up in the north and never cared about his clothing. Furthermore, he simply didn't like leather shoes; "Too stiff, too slippery; simply doesn't feel right." I remember the night he first met Mr. W, he wore a pair of new leather shoes.

Shanghai Ramblings

### The Soldiers' Complaints

Once, on the tram, I bumped into a soldier due to the crowd. He reacted as if he had been electrocuted, his face turning red, clenching his fists, appearing ready to challenge me. He was very sturdy, and if he had started a fight, I would have immediately tasted his "leather fist," maybe even a couple of ear slaps. But I was versed in the "Confucian and Buddhist" ways of tolerance, and despite his repeated glares, I endured it to avoid trouble, and ultimately, a major disaster was averted.

Afterwards, when I discussed it with others, many said, "A hero doesn't suffer immediate losses," and it's best not to argue with them.

Another time, on the bus, when getting off, the pushing from behind caused me to accidentally bump into two well-dressed soldiers in front of me. After getting off the bus, they also had angry faces. One of them looked me up and down, as if trying to assess my status, clearly intending to start a fight. At that moment, I thought, "Status can actually deflect someone's fist?" This was unexpected.

After these two lessons, I became especially deferential to soldiers, because they are quick-tempered and easily angered. Although I don't intentionally offend them, even a slight carelessness turns me into their punching bag, which is a significant loss for me.

But later, after calming down and thinking about it, they have too many "complaints" in their lives, so I can't blame their rudeness. Especially in Shanghai's extravagant environment, it is a constant mockery and provocation to them. The dazzling and colorful nightlife of the city is truly irritating to them.

Moreover, many of them are brave warriors who have endured bloody battles. How can they not be angry when they see Shanghai's prosperity and wealth?

It's just like what Remarque wrote in "The Road Back," the returning soldiers are psychologically abnormal and unhealthy. They hate everything and complain about everything.

Therefore, when you encounter their hateful gaze or angry demeanor on the streetcar, you should be 100% calm and handle the situation accordingly.

### Anecdotes About Wedemeyer's Visit to China

— Jiamu

During World War II, the highest-ranking American generals stationed in the Eastern and Western theaters were often more military organizers than battlefield commanders, and also military diplomats. Eisenhower in the West was such a figure, and General Wedemeyer, who came to China again, was also of this type.

General Wedemeyer's current position is due to his service in the China theater during the war. However, Churchill had an indirect role in sending General Wedemeyer to China, which is a very interesting historical anecdote.

Wedemeyer had studied in Germany and was an expert in German tactics. He was a valued member of Marshall's inner circle and originally an important staff member at Eisenhower's headquarters. During the Quebec Conference, Roosevelt and Churchill convened a meeting of senior generals to discuss the issue of opening up the Western theater. Churchill initially strongly opposed landing in France, saying that the risk of failure was too great, and that the strength of the British and American air forces would reach its peak in 1944. He argued that strategic bombing for a year would destroy all of Germany's industrial cities, and the war would inevitably end, but the cost of massive bloodshed could be avoided. Roosevelt and Marshall both opposed this view, and ultimately decided to discuss the technical problems of opening a second theater. Churchill, because his opinion was not adopted, insisted that if a landing in Western Europe were to happen, the United States would need to contribute 70% of the troops, while Britain could only contribute 30%, and angrily said: "I cannot waste the seed of the British Empire." At the time, Wedemeyer was present and opposed, arguing from the standpoint of "military science" that the ratio of British and American landing forces should be fifty-fifty, so that the second front could be opened in 1943. Otherwise, if the United States were to transport a large army to the British Isles, the losses due to submarine activity would be significant, and coupled with rest and training, the end of the war would be delayed by a year. Wedemeyer's views were supported by the American side, but Churchill stubbornly refused to budge. Finally, Roosevelt, for the sake of preserving the British-American alliance, accepted the British view. From then on, Churchill was quite wary of Wedemeyer, believing that having such a person at the Western European headquarters would be detrimental to the interests of the British Empire. Therefore, he chose an extremely appropriate opportunity to cleverly suggest to Roosevelt that Wedemeyer be sent to Mountbatten's headquarters as Deputy Chief of Staff. Churchill's intention was: the Southeast Asia theater was mainly a naval and air war, and Wedemeyer was an expert in German tactics, so sending him there would render him useless and prevent him from hindering Mountbatten's actions. However, things in the world are too changeable and unpredictable. After Stilwell left, due to Marshall's recommendation, Wedemeyer, based on his dual qualifications of having served in China in his youth and having diplomatic skills, was sent to China to take on a major responsibility on his own.

Wedemeyer's contributions during and after the war are well known. Here, I will briefly mention a couple of small matters to illustrate his ability to handle people. As soon as he arrived in China, he reversed Stilwell's arrogant attitude and strived to establish friendship with the Chinese authorities. Whenever he met with the Chairman, his tone and manner were always that of a Chinese Chief of Staff, rather than the Commander of the American Army. It is said that when he made suggestions to the Chairman, in addition to detailing the reasons and hoping for adoption, he also humbly said: "If you make a contrary decision, I will certainly obey." This good attitude preserved the self-esteem of the head of state, making it easier to promote all events. Chairman Chiang rarely attended private receptions for foreigners, but General Wedemeyer, while in Chongqing, actually managed to get the Chairman to make an exception and attend his evening meal, which he repeatedly declared to be his personal great honor. He had a high degree of sympathy for the Chinese people and leaders. On the eve of victory, he wrote an article published in the American Collier's magazine, objectively pointing out China's difficulties and ways to overcome them, and explaining to the outside world any misunderstandings of China. He was extremely dissatisfied with China's military supply system, advocating that American officers should handle supplies for China during the major counter-offensive. However, at the same time, he greatly praised the integrity and efforts of Chen Cheng, Yu Dawei, Lin Kesheng, and others, hoping that American criticism of China would not negate everything. These small actions, accumulated, made a considerable contribution to Sino-American friendship.

Here, I will end this article with a quote from a diplomatic figure: "Marshall's work in China needed someone to tidy up and finish it. Munitions and reinforcements are only a signal, and now Wedemeyer has finally come to tidy things up. In the Far East, the United States uses strategy to guide diplomacy; in Marshall, strategy and diplomacy are integrated, while Wedemeyer is in fact Marshall's representative."

### Reduced Printing Technique

— Anyuan

The 24 massive volumes of the Encyclopedia Britannica are only two inches thick.

The entire collection of the Harvard Library can be viewed in remote small places.

American scientists can request various books from the government for free when they need them, regardless of the language. This is envied by anyone who likes to study science but cannot afford books, but when you see the books they receive, you must be greatly surprised, because they are not ordinary books, but rather collections bound with cardstock, densely arranged with many black rectangles, the original twenty-seven thousand pages of the Encyclopedia Britannica are only two inches thick in one volume. At that time, you will definitely have the impression of "Can this be considered a book?" Do not be surprised! This is an important factor that has helped American science develop particularly rapidly during the war - reduced printing technique.

The reduced printing technique was invented by the American publisher Albert Boni after five years of effort. Each page of his medical prints requires many black blocks that are three-quarters of an inch long and half an inch wide, each black block is equivalent to a page of an ordinary book. To adapt to this kind of book, he also invented a reading machine called Readea, which looks like a typewriter. It is extremely convenient to read reduced books on the reading machine. Just pull out the narrow drawer at the bottom of the machine, insert the book, then turn the machine button, turn on the light inside the machine, and correct the focus. Then you can see a book the same size as an ordinary book on the transparent sheet on the top. You only need to raise your hand to turn the book page by page, or ten pages, or a hundred pages at a time.

This reading machine costs about one hundred and twenty US dollars, which is the biggest expense in reading reduced books. After that, you only need to pay five cents to buy an encyclopedia, and you can buy a complete collection of Greek and Roman classical literature for very little cost, while the market only has its fragments and excerpts. Lawyers, engineers, doctors, scholars, and specialists can see rare and precious works on their desks without going to the library. The world's largest Harvard Library, which contains almost all the knowledge in the world, can appear in every remote small town by using reduced printing technique. Therefore, people who have used reduced books all praise it as the greatest invention in printing.

### Miscellanea from America

— Xu Shuyuan

America's Honored Veterans

Where there is a country, there is war; where there is war, there are wounded soldiers. No, they should be called honored veterans. Honored veterans have contributed to the war of resistance and should be given preferential treatment by society, but society is cold and human feelings are snobbish. Honored veterans have become soldiers without weapons. Having lost a leg, they go door-to-door with crutches to solicit donations, even filing lawsuits. Where is the honor in that? The experience of American honored veterans is different. The death benefit is ten thousand dollars, and the disabled receive additional compensation. Veterans who are not injured or have recovered are welcomed back by the local people, and the government has stipulated several measures. Those who wish to study receive a monthly allowance of fifty dollars for tuition and fees, regardless of their previous rank. Those who wish to open farms or factories only need to submit detailed plans, and the government will provide start-up funds in unlimited amounts. Those who wish to purchase real estate can prepare drawings and 5% of the cash, while the remaining 95% can be borrowed from banks with extremely low interest rates through government guarantees. Those who wish to study abroad can be listed as exchange students and sent abroad. Those who do not wish to retire can serve for another three years. With the government treating honored veterans so well, who would not be loyal and patriotic, preparing for a third world war to stage another heroic scene? The government treats them as national heroes, and the soldiers repay the country as national heroes. Therefore, very few people desert in the American army. Think about it, to be a basic soldier, you have a base salary of fifty dollars, a family allowance of twenty-five dollars, a thirty-dollar allowance for the first child, and thirty-dollar allowances for the second and third children, plus meal allowances, housing allowances, and overseas allowances. You can earn more than two hundred US dollars a month. Where can you find such a good position? To be an honored veteran, you are guaranteed food and clothing at the very least. The American army is elite and not numerous. Training a soldier who can fight costs about 30,000 rounds of bullets alone. Adding the equipment and all the expenses during the training period, a soldier is worth about 100,000 US dollars. The fifty-dollar-a-month salary is just a drop in the bucket. The ten thousand dollar death benefit is just a small contribution. (25)

### The Prince of Fu's "Old Immortal Doctrine" – Recollections of a Chaotic Era, Part Two

— Ying

Wu Meicun said a few words about the Prince of Fu (who was also the Hongguang Emperor at the time) who ascended the throne in Nanjing in the "Lu Zhi Jibun":

"The world may say that the Prince of Fu read little, and could not personally decide on decrees, so that the inner eunuchs and outer retainers could rely on each other to commit fraud. In his usual eating, drinking, and feasting, he would run wildly in the palace gardens, as if he had lost his mind. As for male prostitutes, young girls, and using medicines to indulge in lust, all of these are exaggerations of hearsay. These words may be true. In short, he is like Liu Adou of the Han Dynasty. Even if Shi (Kefa) and Gao (Hongtu) and other gentlemen were in court, it would be difficult to assist him; let alone Ma (Shiying) and Ruan (Dacheng)?"

On New Year's Eve of the year Yi Si, the Prince of Fu was in the Xingning Palace, and was unhappily happy. The eunuch Han Zanzhou entered the room and said, "The new palace should be joyful, but the emperor seems to be somewhat unhappy, does he miss his late father?" The Prince of Fu did not respond, and then said, "There are too few good actors in the pear garden." Before this time, there was a rumor in Nanjing that "There are secretaries everywhere, governors are walking all over the streets, censors are as many as sheep, and officials are as cheap as dogs. The legacy of a thousand years is unearthed, and a tribute student presents his head, sweeping away the threads of Jiangnan to fill the mouths of the Ma family." On the one hand, the Qing soldiers were pressing forward, and the four garrisons were fighting among themselves. Zuo Liangyu stationed troops in Jiangzuo, and fought with Ma Shiying endlessly. In addition, there was a severe drought in Jiangnan, and it did not rain for several months. Gentlemen like Gao Antu had all resigned from politics. Everywhere one looked, there was an atmosphere of national demise. However, on the other hand, "The prime minister only loves money, and the emperor only drinks wine." What is even worse is that "Grand Secretary Gao Hongtu was dismissed, and Ma Shiying replaced him as the chief grand secretary. The Prince of Fu listened with his hands clasped in front of him, and lived in the forbidden palace, taking pleasure only in performing miscellaneous dramas, drinking spirits, and ravishing young girls. The people called him the Old Immortal." And the overlord believed in it so thoroughly that on that New Year's Eve, he was still a little "unhappily happy", leaving behind the humorous and witty saying: "There are too few good actors in the pear garden."

Wu Meicun said that the Prince of Fu was a Liu Adou, and his mediocrity was real. However, the licentiousness and lust were too exaggerated by hearsay. However, the historical records contain a memorial from the official Chen Zilong:

"Recently, eunuchs have been sent out in all directions. If a woman in the folk has any beauty, she is selected into the palace with a yellow paper pasted on her forehead, causing a disturbance in the neighborhoods. Please issue a prohibition."

When the Qing army had broken Haozhou and Dorgon led his troops to Huai'an, the situation became increasingly urgent. However, the Southern Capital was still busy with the selection of beautiful women.

"A woman surnamed Ruan was selected from seventy people, a niece of Dacheng. In addition, fifty beautiful women were sent from Zhejiang, and one surnamed Wang and one surnamed Zhou were selected, and all were sent to the palace prison."

In such a year, unexpectedly, Grand Marshal Ruan Dacheng still wanted to be the emperor's father-in-law. Although this was one of the means by which courtiers flattered and pleased, it is likely not an "inaccurate rumor" that the Fu Lord was quite interested in "ravishing young girls" amidst the sound of cannons.

What made the Prince of Fu dare to face the Qing soldiers without moving was his "Old Immortal Doctrine" – performing miscellaneous dramas, drinking spirits, and ravishing young girls, after all, were more interesting than handling state affairs.

However, the good times did not last long. Finally, the false prince case occurred. The Prince of Fu was naturally more anxious than anyone else, so he moved the false prince to Nanjing and imprisoned him, determined to put him to death! Otherwise, "How can I deal with myself?" The Jiangshan was already only this much under the swords of the Qing soldiers, and could not be divided, nor was it willing to be divided again. Moreover, if the other party was really the prince, he would have to abdicate. Being able to divide the family would still be a great blessing. Therefore, on other political struggles, "he only loved to drink wine", and was inevitably confused. He had his "Old Immortal Doctrine". When it came to the life-and-death moment of fighting for the throne, he seemed very shrewd and became a thorough man of the world. He was afraid that a real prince would suddenly appear, similar to the situation after the Southern Song Dynasty, when Gaozong did not want the two emperors to return south.

However, although he tremblingly did a few years as an emperor who "only loved to drink wine", with the support of Ma Shiying, Ruan Dacheng and others, he was still able to taste the flavor of the life of a surrendered lord of the "dynasty". After being captured, he was interrogated by Dorgon, and then ended in loneliness. It seems that it was because he lost the conditions of life that he could not adhere to his "Old Immortal Doctrine".

### Illusions of the End of the World

— Binzhi

Two years ago, the first atomic bomb landed in Hiroshima, showing its great power. Scientists have been discussing its consequences; in particular, many astronomers worry that it will hinder the safety of the Earth and cause the world to tend towards destruction. What is this illusion of the end of the world like? In their imagination, one day the solar system will be destroyed by atomic energy, and the Earth will undergo drastic changes. It will be cremated in high heat, frozen by ice currents, or lose its balance of power with other planets, causing chaotic collisions that will destroy the Earth.

Fire has the greatest destructive power, and the devastation after the war is mostly a manifestation of fire. The Earth may be destroyed by the violence of the god of fire. The sun is affected by atomic energy, and its volume slowly expands due to internal changes. It will be three times larger than the current sun, and its heat will also increase. The temperature on Earth will also rise to a point where it can melt metal, and everything will be destroyed by melting under the torment of high heat.

The firepower of meteorites may also destroy the Earth. Although there have been meteorites in the past, they were not very serious. Atomic energy may allow meteorites to increase in size and firepower, and fall in urban areas like New York. Millions of people, countless buildings, and everything else are surrounded by flames, and everything turns to ashes in an instant. If several meteorites fell in several major cities at the same time, wouldn't the world be destroyed in this way?

Although firepower has supreme power, the Earth cannot be without fire for a moment. If the Earth is shaken by atomic energy and goes out of orbit, leaving the sun a little further away. At that time, the Earth will be surrounded by glaciers and cold currents because it cannot get the sun's warmth, and it will be several times colder than the current Arctic or Antarctic. Everything is frozen, stiff, and the Earth is destroyed by depression.

After the solar system is destroyed, many planets have no orbits to follow, so they fly aimlessly in the vacuum of the universe. If a planet larger than the Earth flies close to the Earth, the people, objects, and everything that can be moved on Earth will be attracted by that planet and ascend to the sky during the day, dancing in the sky. This is not an illusion of the fairy world, but a prelude to a tragedy. They collide, destroy, and eventually tend towards destruction in mid-air.

If a planet smaller than the Earth approaches, there will also be terrible things happening. For example, if the moon intrudes within 8,000 miles of the Earth's orbit, the moon will be split by the Earth's gravity. When these countless fragments fall to the ground, everything on Earth will be destroyed. What remains are just fragments of the moon, like new moons.

Are the astronomer's words terrible? Miserable? But whether this scene will happen, let's see the facts in the future. (Illustration of a scene of the end of the world)
