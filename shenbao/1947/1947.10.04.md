### Widespread Warfare in the Northeast　National Army Deploys Properly, People’s Hearts Are Calm　Shenyang Strengthens City Defenses, Martial Law Begins Today

[Our Shenyang Dispatch, 3rd] The Northeastern Communist bandits have launched a full-scale offensive, adopting tactics of small groups of forces attacking various transportation stations and strongholds in cities large and small, with flames of war raging everywhere. The National Army has adopted countermeasures in response to the bandits' actions. The bandits' six offensives first absorbed the majority of the National Army's forces in the Liaoxi Corridor, and then began their attacks. Jinzhou, Siping, and Yingkou are all targets the bandits cannot forget, but judging from the bandits' strength in Liaoxi, they are already exhausted and can only cause trouble by fleeing; they are not strong enough to engage the National Army in direct combat. Moreover, after the Battle of Siping, the military authorities made effective deployments early on, so even if the bandits have a major conspiracy, it is beyond their capabilities. Currently, traffic is disrupted to Pan's outer areas, west to Xingcheng, south to Liaoyang, and north to Kaiyuan. However, with Chen Cheng stationed in the Northeast, people's hearts are as calm as usual.

[Another Dispatch] The Air Force is dispatched in all directions, and the sound of aircraft is heard above Shenyang. Military agencies are working intensely, and public places are strengthening their guard. Shenyang has decided to declare temporary martial law starting from the 4th, with martial law hours from 9:30 PM to 5:30 AM the following morning. Prices have suddenly risen, with cigarettes, rice, and flour, etc., increasing by about one-tenth. Garrison Commander Chu Xichun convened his subordinates on the 3rd to discuss strengthening city defenses and public security. Zheng Dongguo flew back to Pan from Jinzhou on the 2nd to report to Chen on the course of the battle in Liaoxi and to jointly discuss ways to deal with the current situation.

[Another Dispatch] A bandit force in the northern section of the China Changchun Railway suddenly attacked Zhonggu Station between Tieling and Kaiyuan on the morning of the 2nd, and vehicles heading north were stopped at Tieling. The National Army at Kaiyuan retreated to Qinghe, and bandits from the Dabao area invaded Mazhonghe Station south of Changtu. A bandit force on the western route suddenly attacked the Xinminliuliu Station and Dabao on the Beining Road at 6:30 PM on the 2nd. Traffic police joined the National Army in a fierce battle with the bandits overnight, and the bandits retreated at dawn. In the southern section, bandits invaded Dashiqiao, and the National Army retreated to defend Yingkou. Furthermore, there were battles at Anshanbei Yuanyangnanshoushan and Lishan Stations. Shoushan and Lishan were occupied by bandits overnight, and the bandits were repelled at dawn on the 2nd. After Dashiqiao fell into the hands of the bandits, the Anshan Iron and Steel Plant's location was isolated.

### Fierce Fighting Around Changchun　Yitong, Huaide, and Other Places Abandoned

[Our Changchun Dispatch, 3rd] The fighting south of Changchun is increasingly approaching the city. Datun, south of Mengjiatun in Changchun, fell last night at 10:00 PM, and Fanjiatun also fell into the hands of the bandits. [Another Dispatch] The fighting in the Changji area has now unfolded separately. Princess Ling, Liufangzi, Taojiatun, and Fanjiatun, on the China Changchun Railway line, all experienced fierce fighting last night. Liufangzi has become a seesaw battle, Taojiatun was abandoned by the National Army, and Fanjiatun experienced a cannon battle all night. The Changchun telephone line was cut off at 9:00 AM on the 3rd. Lao Kaiyuan was invaded by the Communist bandits last night, and Princess Ling was still in fierce battle this afternoon. Yitong was captured by the bandits last night, and the Secretary-General of the county party headquarters was kidnapped. Bandit forces split into groups at 4:00 PM on the 3rd, one group fleeing to Danantun, and another Princess Ling. The Xian bandit forces are moving south towards Panyang. Xi'an is reporting urgency. Sanjiang, west of Siping, has also seen fighting. The National Army at Danantun, 60 li south of Changchun, withdrew after achieving its combat results. Huaide, west of the China Changchun Railway, was again invaded by the bandits, and the National Army in Jiangmifeng, north of Jilin, also withdrew from its strongholds near Tangfang (6 kilometers west of Jiangmifeng), controlling the high ground west of Jiangmifeng. [Another Dispatch] Both Jilin cities experienced a power outage from 9:25 PM last night for a period of one and a half hours. Although the fighting on the periphery has spread and expanded, and prices in the city have soared due to the interruption of transportation, the general public is still very calm.

### Soviet Artillery Batteries in Lushun　Bombard Our Chinese Merchant Ship

The above stations are being repaired under the supervision of railway engineer corps. However, because the destruction was severe, it will take until next Wednesday or Thursday at the earliest to repair. The Headquarters of the Communist Bandit's Jidong Military Region is currently stationed in Qianhua City. Two of the four brigades in Jidong have exited the pass to provide aid. The National Army is conducting extensive sweeps in various parts of Jidong.

Following the victory in Chahar North, Chahar East has also achieved combat results. The National Army in Huailai engaged in a fierce battle with the Bandit's Independent 4th Brigade and other units, totaling more than 4,000, south of Fanshanbao for three days. The bandits suffered heavy losses, and by September 30th, the bandits fled south across the Great Wall via Zifokou. The National Army is currently tracking and suppressing them along the Great Wall.

[Our Weixian Dispatch, 3rd] The National Army, which recovered Yantai, continued to advance eastward along the Weihai Highway on the 3rd. The vanguard reached the outskirts of Muping City after passing Xin'an on the 3rd and is currently engaged in fierce fighting with the bandits. The navy and air force have destroyed most of the Communist bandits' main fortifications between Muping and Weihaiwei. The remaining main force of the Communist Bandit's Ninth Column and a part of the Thirteenth Column, totaling about 10,000, who crossed the Wei River west have been surrounded by the National Army in the area south of Changyi and north of the Jiaoji Railway. A part of them, about two or three thousand, once harassed the outskirts of Weifang but have been repelled by the National Army.

[Our Bengbu Dispatch, 3rd] The bandits in Suxian captured Mengcheng at 11:00 PM on the 2nd. The bandits in Haoxian suffered heavy casualties after being bombed by the air force. Military transport in Bengbu is frequent, and the air force has returned north to assist in the battle, with the train station presenting a wartime scene.

[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 3rd] Chen's bandits attempted to cross the Jinpu Railway eastward towards northern Jiangsu, but their attempt was foiled by the strong resistance of the National Army in Suxian.

They have merged with Liu's bandits, and the National Army is using a pincer movement to encircle Chen and Liu's bandits together. Fierce fighting is expected to break out on both banks of the upper reaches of the Huai River.

### Bandit Areas Are Actually Hell　Filled with Hypocrisy and Cruelty　Realization of a Left-Leaning Foreign Reporter

[Central News Agency, Yantai, 3rd] Australian left-leaning reporter Kaine has now realized that "the CCP is indeed an enemy of mankind." Kaine arrived at Shijiusuo from Shanghai on a UN relief ship last year and entered the Shandong bandit area. He stayed in the Communist area for seven months. As a result, he realized that the "human paradise" promoted by the Communist bandits was actually a human hell. He was completely deprived of freedom of information in the bandit area. The Communist bandits used strict methods to "entertain" him, but he still found that everything the Communist bandits did was hypocritical, deceptive, and cruel. When the Jiaodong Communist bandits collapsed, a ship was sent to "kidnap" him to Dalian. He was intercepted by our Shui Tai warship on the way and was able to meet with reporters on the ship. Kaine thought he was going to the bandit area to report on the "Communist Party's benevolent governance," but the facts told him that there was only tyranny and no "benevolent governance" in the bandit area. Afterwards, he said that what Snow had seen in the past was only the situation in Yan'an, the capital of the CCP. That was a false model made by the Communist Party for foreigners to see. This time, he went to various places in the Shandong Communist area and truly saw the true face of the Communist bandits.

### Huo Baoshu Dispels Intention to Resign

[Our Report] Huo Baoshu, the head of the Xingzheng Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, strongly requested to resign due to illness, but his request was not approved.

### Sir Grantham Issues Statement　Resolves to Help Us Prevent Smuggling　Does Not Express Opinion on the Return of Hong Kong

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 3rd] Hong Kong Governor Sir Grantham hosted reporters at the British Ambassador's residence this morning. After being introduced by Ambassador Stevenson and Secretary Geng Si, Mr. Grantham answered the questions raised by the reporters in detail. He stated that the trip was purely a friendly visit and that there was no task involving other commercial or financial technical matters. He had established good friendships with General Zhang Fakui and others soon after taking office and hoped to have the opportunity to meet with Mr. Song Ziwen soon. He also believed that mid- and lower-level officials in Hong Kong and Guangdong should also have frequent contact. Regarding the Hong Kong smuggling problem, the Customs has broken more than 500 cases this year and seized smuggled goods worth US$500,000. The Hong Kong government is determined to do everything possible to assist China in dealing with this serious problem. In addition, regarding financial and economic matters, the Central Bank has agreed on some measures with the Hong Kong government. He emphasized that he is willing to strengthen Hong Kong's indispensable cooperation with China under any circumstances. The housing shortage in Hong Kong after the war is serious, and the Hong Kong government is fully engaged in the reconstruction work to meet these livelihood needs. The British post-war policy of governing Hong Kong is much more relaxed than before in the political field. Two-thirds of the City Council are elected by the people, with 30 councilors, half Chinese and half foreign. In the economic field, agriculture has been planned in the reconstruction. Engineering projects in Hong Kong are waiting to be repaired, and the Hong Kong government is also planning to open a tunnel between Hong Kong and Kowloon to strengthen transportation. As for the progress and timing of the negotiations between China and Britain on the return of Hong Kong, administrative officials have not expressed their opinions. In the evening, Mr. Grantham attended a banquet hosted by Ambassador Dai Weishi. At 5:30 PM, Vice Minister (Acting Minister) Liu Shiwu hosted a cocktail party, and at 8:00 PM, British Ambassador Stevenson held a farewell dinner for him. Mr. Grantham is scheduled to leave Beijing with his entourage at 9:00 AM on the 4th to return to Hong Kong to welcome the arrival of Lord Amon, a member of the British Parliamentary Delegation to China.

### Inflation in Hong Kong　Salaried Class Suffers

[United Press, Hong Kong, 3rd] The situation regarding suppressing inflation in Hong Kong is obviously worse than it was a year ago. Chinese and foreign salaried employees feel increasingly distressed, and the Hong Kong dollar has also depreciated. In February of this year, a reporter exchanged US dollars for Hong Kong dollars at a rate of HK$4.10 per dollar, which was only HK$0.20 higher than the official rate (equivalent to US$0.05), and there was no trouble. However, when exchanging US dollars yesterday, the rate was HK$5.50 per dollar, which was HK$1.50 higher than the official rate, and there was a lot of trouble. Hong Kong still appears stable and clean on the surface, but prices are out of control, and the press is openly denouncing speculators, saying that this situation cannot be tolerated. Recently, the telephone company applied to the Hong Kong government to increase telephone charges, which has aroused public indignation.

### British Delegation to China Arrives in Bangkok

[Central News Agency, Bangkok, 3rd] The British Parliamentary Delegation to China will arrive in Bangkok on the afternoon of the 4th and fly to Hong Kong on the morning of the 5th.

### Dong Xianguang's Speech　Refuting the China Democratic League's Defense

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 3rd] Dong Xianguang, Director of the Information Bureau of the Executive Yuan, pointed out the facts that members of the China Democratic League colluded with the Communist bandits and participated in the rebellion at a press conference a few days ago. Luo Longji and Huang Yanpei have made some defenses on this matter. A reporter recently inquired with Director Dong about this matter, and he delivered a speech, listing three facts and refuting the defenses of Luo and Huang. (The full text of the speech can be found in the first column of the second page)

### The Reformist Faction of the Social Democratic Party　Denies Joining the China Democratic League

[Our Report] A certain important member of the reformist faction of the Social Democratic Party recently solemnly stated that the rumor that the Reform Committee of the Social Democratic Party had joined the China Democratic League was completely unfounded.

### Land Administration Conference Concludes　Zhang Qun Attends and Addresses the Meeting　More Than 200 Proposals Approved

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 3rd] The National Land Administration Conference convened its fourth and fifth plenary sessions on the 3rd, both in the morning and afternoon, concluding all the agenda items and holding a closing ceremony at 4:00 PM in the afternoon. President Zhang Qun attended the closing ceremony and addressed the meeting. Zhang pointed out that the main principles of the People's Livelihood in the Three Principles of the People, such as "land to the tillers," "equalization of land ownership," and "regulation of capital," are still just slogans, so the problem of people's livelihood has not yet been solved. He encouraged those who implement land policies to not be afraid of wealthy gentry and to strictly implement various established programs. According to reports, the conference lasted for five days and approved more than 200 proposals.

### Our Proposal to Limit the Veto Power　Aims to Avoid Creating a Stalemate　All Parties in the Capital Pay Attention to China's Independent Diplomacy

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 3rd] A spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs told our reporter in the afternoon of the 3rd regarding China's formal proposal to the United Nations to impose procedural restrictions on the exercise of veto power by the five permanent members of the Security Council: "China's action aims to break the stalemate caused by the abuse of the veto power in the past, but it does not mean that China intends to give up the veto power. This point is very important and should be correctly understood by the national debate and the people." The reporter noted that the measures taken by our representative and the independent stance taken on the peace treaty with Japan were both decided before Foreign Minister Wang and his party went abroad. The original intention was to make active provisions for the restrictions on the use of veto power, which could only be used when it involved the sovereignty and major interests of a country. Now, the proposal is to adopt passive provisions. By comparison, it is more feasible. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is unwilling to speculate on which countries will approve or oppose the proposal, but believes that it is a beneficial tool for world peace and international cooperation based on experience and common sense, and can help the United Nations solve the difficult problems that are currently entangled. All parties in the capital only learned about the outline of the matter from the newspapers on the 3rd. Although there was no strong reaction, they are all paying attention to this important and independent diplomatic action of our country. (Our proposal can be found in the third column of the second page)

### The Resident Committee of the Political Participation Council Approves Proposals　Requesting Improvement of the Exchange Rate Between Taiwan and Shanghai　Suggesting the Government Provide Relief to Students Out of School

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 3rd] The Resident Committee of the Political Participation Council held a regular meeting on the 3rd. After Chairman Mo Dehui and the Secretariat reported, Shao Lizi read the written report from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which was roughly divided into three points: 1. We agreed with the US proposal to include the Korean issue on the agenda of the Second General Assembly of the United Nations, which has been announced by the delegation. 2. The British parliamentary delegation to China is coming to China. 3. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent a note to the French side in Vietnam, requesting them to stop the election of "Bangzhang." Then, Minister Yu of the Ministry of Food reported on the administrative situation of the 36th year. Subsequently, the proposals were discussed, and three proposals were passed: 1. The proposal by Wang Puhan and two others requesting the government to quickly provide relief to students out of school was resolved to be submitted to the government for prompt action. 2. The proposal by Lu Qian and eight others requesting the government to improve and expand the methods of local councils was resolved to be submitted to the government for serious consideration. 3. The proposal by Lin Zhong and five others requesting the government to improve the exchange rate between Taiwan and Shanghai in order to stabilize Taiwan's economy was resolved to be submitted to the government for adoption. (The original proposal for improving and expanding local council methods can be found in the fourth column of the second page)

### Yu Feipeng Reports on Food Administration　And Frankly Explains Cases of Malfeasance

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 3rd] Food Minister Yu Feipeng attended the Standing Committee of the Political Participation Council on the 3rd to report on the administrative situation in the 36th year, which was roughly divided into three points: 1. The procurement of military rations, the supply of public grain and civilian food, and 2. The improvements that should be made in various businesses of the Ministry of Food. 3. The burden of food in Siping, plus a 10% reserve, totals 44 million dan. However, although this year's harvest in the Yangtze River area is good, it can only be counted at 80%, so the actual grain requisition is based on 80%, with 36 million dan plus 10%, which is 39.6 million dan, which is the military grain. Secondly, the public grain and a part of the civilian food in Beijing and Shanghai are estimated as follows: Shanghai issues 220,000 bags of rice and 10,000 tons of flour every month. Beijing issues more than 50,000 dan of rice and more than 60,000 tons of flour every month. By the end of the month, the China Farmers' Bank has completed the purchase, and the rest needs 10 million dan. The first phase of 5 million dan is also purchased by the Agricultural Bank. Secondly, attention should be paid to storage. Minister Yu also frankly reported on the cases of malfeasance by the staff of the institutions under the ministry. From January to September of this year, a total of 508 cases were reviewed and compiled.

Editorial

### 中韓貿易恢復問題

Regarding the resumption of trade between China and Korea, the government is considering it at the request of overseas Chinese in Korea and has decided on the principle of open trade. The Executive Yuan has issued a directive to the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission to inform the various overseas Chinese organizations in Korea to comply. A portion of the members of the Control Yuan, in order to prevent the crisis of disguised Sino-Japanese trade, suggested to the government on September 29 that if China-Korea trade is opened, the relevant departments should carefully revise the measures in advance and strictly control them afterward, paying attention to the requests of both sides and identifying the original place of origin and final destination of the goods to nip problems in the bud. The Control Yuan members are acting with caution, fearing that the resumption of Sino-Korean trade will become a disguised form of opening up Sino-Japanese trade. In reality, Sino-Japanese trade is one matter, and Sino-Korean trade is another. We do not fully endorse the opening of Sino-Japanese trade, but regarding the restoration of Sino-Korean trade, we take the position of safeguarding the interests of overseas Chinese and believe it is currently necessary.

China and Korea are fraternal countries with adjacent lands and somewhat similar customs, so the relationship of mutual need and assistance in economic terms is extremely close. Before the war, there were approximately 300,000 overseas Chinese merchants in Korea, with more than 5,000 shops. Including their dependents who depended on this for a living, there were no fewer than one million people. During the war, normal Sino-Korean economic activity was interrupted, and the entire Korean market was monopolized by Japan. With trade stagnation, overseas Chinese merchants were left with no income and were in dire straits. After the war, Korea was divided between the United States and the Soviet Union, which implemented different control policies. In South Korea, Koreans urgently needed Chinese goods, and the US military government proposed trade requests. Initially, our government insisted on settling in US dollars, but the interim measures were not accepted by the US side. Subsequently, following the example of the Sino-Japanese barter trade method, the Central Trust Bureau was designated to preside over it. On November 21 of last year, the Executive Yuan also issued an order to the customs authorities that Sino-Korean trade was being discussed with General MacArthur's headquarters. Before an agreement was reached, all applications for goods to be shipped to Korea were prohibited from export. As a result of this active restriction, the Central Trust Bureau never started the process because Sino-Korean trade was trivial and unprofitable, while the customs authorities used the ban as an excuse to seize all goods shipped back from Korea, forcing overseas Chinese compatriots who had no means of livelihood to sell their assets and convert them into goods for shipment. Regardless of the risks at sea, they risked their lives to return to their home country, only to have their goods seized and confiscated without any recourse. This is a significant harm to overseas Chinese merchants caused by strict government controls. In North Korea, the Soviet army completely locked down the external relations of Koreans and our overseas Chinese compatriots. Only the communist-occupied areas of Shandong, Liaoning, and Andong vigorously encouraged overseas Chinese merchants to go to Korea to barter, and exchange for marine products to be transported to our areas to extract legal currency. Under these circumstances of procrastination and indecision, the government not only failed to help the affected overseas Chinese compatriots, but also indirectly drove overseas Chinese merchants onto the path of supporting the communists. This mistake is harmful to both China and Korea and even more detrimental to hundreds of thousands of overseas Chinese compatriots.

Before the war, Korea was a colony monopolized by Japan and was economically dependent on Japan. After the war, although Korea was nominally independent, the north and south were not unified, but the will of the Korean people was for independence, and their spirit was unified. Economically, Korea had long broken free from Japanese domination and became a commodity market for the United States and the Soviet Union. Koreans eagerly hoped for the resumption of Sino-Korean trade, and our overseas Chinese compatriots in Korea regarded the opening of Sino-Korean trade as essential to their survival. They repeatedly appealed, hoping that the government would have a clear understanding of this issue and reconsider it. In March of this year, the Third Plenary Session of the Kuomintang was held, and Central Committee members Fan Yuyu and others requested the restoration of Sino-Korean trade, stating the advantages and disadvantages. A resolution was made to submit it to the government for handling. Zhou Shenjiu, chairman of the China-Korea Trade Association, and others repeatedly petitioned the government in November and December of last year and April of this year to lift the ban on trade with Korea and proposed the principle of interim Sino-Korean trade measures before the establishment of a formal government in Korea, in order to restore normal relations as soon as possible. The Executive Yuan, following the requests of overseas Chinese merchants and weighing the advantages and disadvantages, recently decided on the following three principles: It is indeed necessary to consider opening up Sino-Korean trade. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs should, in the short term, first ascertain the attitudes and policies of the United States and Korea, and then formulate detailed measures for navigation and trade. All confiscated goods belonging to overseas Chinese in Korea that fall under the category of temporarily suspended imports should be released after supplementary tax payments. Before Sino-Korean trade is officially opened, overseas Chinese in Korea who continue to apply for importing goods will be allowed to declare and pay taxes for release, except for prohibited imports; exports will be postponed. Based on these three principles, the government is allowing a partial, not full, resumption of Sino-Korean trade. The order prohibiting overseas Chinese merchants from exporting goods, issued last November, has been partially revised, but the ban has not been abandoned. According to this principle, Sino-Korean trade is only allowed with limited imports and unconditional non-exports. This is a trade policy of closing rather than opening, which is still far from the demands of overseas Chinese merchants and the barter trade between China and Korea. Under these circumstances, if strict controls are maintained, the so-called resumption of Sino-Korean trade will only be nominal rather than substantive, and how can we even talk about establishing Sino-Korean economic relations?

There are theoretical and factual problems with opening up trade. The restoration of Sino-Korean trade should not be equated with it or confused with it. We agree with the requests of overseas Chinese merchants in Korea: 1. Abolish the ban on imports and exports to Korea. All applications for exports or imports to Korea by overseas Chinese merchants certified by the China-Korea Trade Association, who comply with customs regulations and complete the procedures, should be approved for release to open up a path for overseas Chinese merchants. 2. Based on historical Sino-Korean trade records and with reference to current import and export trade measures, separately determine the types of goods allowed for import and export to Korea to meet the needs. Imports such as ginseng and seafood seem permissible, while coarsely made ramie cloth, mats, and large peppers seem permissible for export, so that they can be exchanged and both sides can benefit.

Currently, Koreans are eagerly hoping for the opening of Sino-Korean trade, and the situation of hundreds of thousands of overseas Chinese in Korea is even more precarious. In order to strengthen Sino-Korean economic relations, to relieve overseas Chinese compatriots, to safeguard their interests, and to restore Sino-Korean trade, it is indeed a current necessity!

### 宋子文談話
### Song Ziwen's Speech

In his address at the handover ceremony, Song Ziwen stated: "Twenty years have passed since I left Guangdong for the Northern Expedition. I am extremely pleased to return to my hometown to serve. My future policy will focus on strengthening post-flood relief, maintaining law and order, and restoring transportation. At the same time, we will strengthen local self-defense forces and absolutely will not allow bandits to spread again. In terms of governance, we will strive to establish a clean and honest atmosphere. This time, upon returning to Guangdong, all parties have placed great expectations on the province's agricultural and industrial construction. Therefore, I sincerely hope for the joint assistance of local individuals. I welcome frank opinions on political reforms and will wholeheartedly accept them." He concluded by stating that he would "strive to ensure that compatriots in Guangdong Province can live and work in peace and contentment in the short term." The ceremony lasted fifty minutes and was completed. On this day, there were no extravagant displays inside or outside Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall, nor were any firecrackers lit. Only white paper notices were posted in front of the Provincial Government, not red paper. This may be a sign of eliminating bureaucratic practices. Mr. Song did not bring anyone to Guangdong and requested that all section chiefs of the Secretariat remain in their positions. At 5 PM, Mr. Song held his first press conference after taking office in the Provincial Government Conference Room. The atmosphere was relaxed and harmonious. Mr. Song answered various questions from reporters, stating that: The Provincial Government's personnel matters were not decided in Nanjing or Shanghai, but rather he intended to seek out talented individuals locally and then recommend them to the central government for appointment. Maintaining law and order and restoring transportation are the current urgent tasks, otherwise economic construction cannot be discussed. He will study the five-year construction plan set by former Chairman Luo in detail before expressing his opinion. Regarding the issue of Hainan Island becoming a province, he has no preconceived notions and plans to study the matter with his fellow villagers in the future. Developing Hainan Island is indeed an important task, and the central government has already had concrete measures. Regarding the news of the Min[zhu] and Qing[nian] parties participating in local government, he had only seen it in the regulations and knew nothing else. He discovered that the economic crisis in Guangdong Province was more serious than before his military service. It will take ten days to break through the difficulties, and he will do his best. At the same time, he hopes for the assistance of the entire province's people.

### 董顯光談話內容
### Dong XianGuang's Speech Content

The following is the long speech by Mr. Dong: "The situation of the Democratic League colluding with the Communist bandits, which I pointed out in my previous press conference, only mentioned some examples. Of course, they all have factual basis. For example: Zi, the weight of the words of evasiveness will not be trusted by anyone. Guoshi joined the Democratic League during the Democratic Political Group Alliance era, as the representative of the Northeast National Salvation General Association, and was a member of the Central Standing Committee at the same time as Zhou Enlai. Luo has already admitted this, and Zhou's appointment as a member of the administrative committee of the Northeast Communist pseudo-organization was officially announced by the bandits, which is an undeniable fact. Details can be found in the September 12th Shanghai Wenhui Daily last year. If it is not accurate, the Democratic League should have denied it long ago. Why wait until today? As for whether Zhou Jingwen is still in the Northeast now, or is traveling between Shanghai and Hong Kong to run errands and liaise for the bandits, it has nothing to do with the plants he is in charge of. The government once captured a so-called 'Northeast People's Autonomous Committee' key member Luo Ziji in the Northeast, and also found a conspiracy document to organize the 'Northeast People's Autonomous Government'. Luo confessed that he was instructed by Zhou Jingwen to carry out activities in the Northeast. The examples of key members of the Democratic League holding positions in the bandit side that I cited a few days ago numbered as many as seven, and Luo Longji could only deny one, while the rest were silent. This is indeed trying to cover up the truth."

### 民開與匪沆一氣
### The Democratic League Colludes with the Bandits

Luo Longji admitted that the Democratic League has organizations in the bandit areas, and that members of the Democratic League also hold positions in the bandit areas. It is common knowledge to the world that the people in the bandit areas have no freedom to speak of, and that they do not allow any individuals or political organizations other than the Communist Party and its affiliates to exist. If the Democratic League does not have a special collusion with the Communist bandits, then I really do not know how the members of the Democratic League can survive in the bandit areas. As for what Luo said that the Democratic League members who hold positions in the bandit side were all before the promulgation of the Suppression of Rebellion Mobilization Order, then after the order was issued, it has neither been heard that these Democratic League members have left the work of the bandit side, nor has the headquarters of the Democratic League announced their expulsion. And Luo and Huang both admitted that "the activities of any political party are based on the guidelines formulated by its central organ", then the Democratic League can hardly escape its responsibility for participating in the bandit side's rebellion organization. The reason is very clear.

### 所謂中立徒托空言
### The So-Called Neutrality is Empty Talk

Luo Longji and Huang Yanpei have both mentioned that the Southern General Branch of the Democratic League openly called for actions to resist the government's Suppression of Rebellion General Mobilization. It is said that the headquarters of the Democratic League, according to the guidelines formulated by the Central Committee of the Democratic League, telegraphed instructions that the written conversation of Mr. Zhang BiaoFang, chairman of the Democratic League, should be the position of the Democratic League. The conversation he referred to by Zhang BiaoFang expressed his dissatisfaction with the government's Suppression of Rebellion Mobilization Order, which was not enough to show a position of transcendence and neutrality. As for this empty and meaningless grumble, I really do not understand how it can cover up the actual actions of the Southern Branch of the Democratic League to secretly organize troops to instigate rebellion. Also, as Huang Yanpei said, the Democratic League does not help the Communist Party to fight the Kuomintang, then there are so many Democratic League members participating in the pseudo-organizations of the Northeast bandits. If they are not helping the Communist bandits to fight the government, who can believe it?

### 此後申辯不再答覆
### No Further Response to Future Defenses

Since the Democratic League participated in the Political Consultative Conference, it has had no independent political opinions. All it has done is follow the Communist Party step by step, which is obvious to the world. It is evident that on the eve of the National Assembly, the Democratic League once participated in the third party to put forward a more neutral peace proposal, but Luo Longji immediately withdrew it after being reprimanded by Zhou Enlai. As the Communist Party representatives withdrew from Beijing and Shanghai, the Democratic League not only inherited the industry that the CCP had left behind, but also the underground work of the CCP was entrusted to the Democratic League, which is also very obvious. The government has obtained conclusive evidence of the Democratic League's agitation of student unrest in various places and other conspiracies. In short, this matter is no longer a problem of written debate, but a question of fact. I do not intend to waste any more words on Luo's subsequent rebuttals, but will publish the facts as a response when necessary."

### 限制使用否決權　我國建議案內容
### Limiting the Use of Veto Power: Content of Our Country's Proposal

[Central News Agency, Chenggong Lake, 2nd] The Chinese delegation to the United Nations General Assembly has formally submitted a draft resolution to impose procedural restrictions on the use of veto power by the five permanent members of the Security Council. Our country's proposal has been listed as an official document of the General Assembly today and distributed to all delegations for reference. Although the language is measured and attempts to avoid amending the rules of procedure of the Security Council stipulated in the Charter, the proposals listed are the most profound suggestions made so far by the five permanent members of the Security Council holding the veto power. Our proposal is divided into three parts: 1. It is recommended that the Security Council determine that certain types of resolutions are procedural matters and that the veto power cannot be used according to the Charter. 2. The five powers are urged to abandon the use of the veto power on matters of peaceful settlement of disputes. 3. The General Assembly is requested to declare that the veto power of a single country cannot cancel the obligations of the members of the Security Council to the Charter, and it is recommended that the majority of countries in the Security Council may negotiate on the implementation of such obligations, or exercise their right to convene a special session of the General Assembly when the veto power of a single country hinders the action of the Security Council. Our country's proposal is expected to be opposed by the Soviet Union, because the Soviet Union firmly refuses to consider "changes in the veto power." The other three powers have not yet made any official comments. According to reliable sources, the US delegation may advocate that the Chinese proposal be submitted to a special committee for study and that a report be submitted to the General Assembly next year. Other non-official comments believe that our country's proposal may coordinate the two major extreme opinions on the veto power issue and seek a solution (one of the extreme opinions is to convene a special General Assembly to amend the Charter and abolish the veto power). Our country's proposal will not be discussed in the near future, because the veto power issue is currently being handled by the Political and Security Subcommittee. The subcommittee has many pending cases, and the relevant sections on the veto power are placed at the end of the agenda.

### Expanding Local Public Opinion Institutions: Senate Standing Committee Proposes Improvement Measures, Opposing Government Selection of Senate Members

[This newspaper, Nanjing, 3rd] After the State Council approved the plan for members of the Min[zhu] and Qing[nian] parties to participate in local public opinion institutions, the Shanghai Municipal Senate raised objections, and the Nanjing Municipal Senate responded. The National Political Council Standing Committee held a meeting on the 3rd. Senators Yu Qian, Yu Nanqiu, Yin Shuxian, Wang Puhan, Wu Chunwu, Xue Mingjian, Lin Zhong, Jin Weixi, and Li Qiajiu jointly submitted a case "Requesting the Government to Improve the Measures for Expanding the Local Senate," which was unanimously considered extremely important after discussion and a resolution was made to "submit it to the government for serious attention." The case is roughly as follows: "Local public opinion institutions in various provinces and cities, except for the current Provisional Senate, have mostly established elected senates. The selection of senators did not initially pay attention to whether they were members of a party. Now, at the request of the Min and Qing parties, the National Government suddenly allows the use of selection methods to allow members of the two parties to participate. This is extremely inconsiderate. If the government discriminates against 'citizens with party affiliation' and 'citizens without party affiliation,' then the so-called public opinion is limited to citizens with party affiliation. At present, the local public opinion institutions are organized by directly elected members of the people. If selected members are inserted midway, it is equivalent to the government undermining the right of senators to recall members in the producing area. Who will recall the selected personnel? This is a laughing stock of democratic politics. It is proposed that the government formulate other appropriate measures."

### French Authorities in Northern Vietnam Attempt to Restore the Bangzhang System: Our Ministry of Foreign Affairs Has Lodged a Protest

[This newspaper, Nanjing, 3rd] Ministry of Foreign Affairs News: The French authorities in Northern Vietnam have recently sought to restore the bangzhang system. Our Ministry of Foreign Affairs believes that the bangzhang system has many long-standing problems and is hated by overseas Chinese. Ambassador Qian was ordered to negotiate with the French side. The French side agreed to order the French authorities in Vietnam to temporarily postpone the election of bangzhang during the negotiations between the two sides. However, the French military commander in Ruomei Street still forced overseas Chinese to change the Chinese Association into a Bang Public Office and elected bangzhang. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs recently summoned the French Ambassador to China to discuss this matter and lodged a protest. The counselor urgently telegraphed to the West to stop the compulsory restoration of the bangzhang system during the Sino-French negotiations. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs re-sent a note to the French ambassador on the 30th of last month, requesting that the French authorities in Vietnam strictly abide by their promise, wait for a diplomatic solution, and urgently telegraphed to stop the compulsory implementation of the bangzhang system in Ruomei Street.

[United Press, Hong Kong, 3rd] The Chinese Textile Merchants Association here has submitted a letter to the Hong Kong government, in view of the current business recession, requesting the restoration of the imperial priority for Hong Kong Chinese textile products to be sold in various parts of the United Kingdom before the war, and requesting it to forward it to the London Colonial Office authorities for review. According to the letter, before the war, Hong Kong's textile industry employed more than 75,000 workers, and it was one of the most important export industries. Today, production has been greatly limited due to the high cost of machinery and raw materials, and the fierce competition from American and Japanese textiles has also made the industry suffer unfavorably.

### Engineers' Annual Meeting

This morning's special topic discussion was divided into seven points and discussed one by one in order to focus the discussion, as the scope was too broad. The first topic raised was: "Under the current situation, what is the focus of industrial construction? How should it be coordinated with agricultural construction to save the social and economic crisis in a timely manner?" Yang Zhaoceng, Xia Guangyu, Xu Enzeng, and others spoke, emphasizing that industrial construction should maintain close ties with agricultural construction, and that the focus should be on power and water conservancy. They also pointed out that the machinery that Japan compensated China should be rationally distributed throughout the country and should be regarded as the lifeline for China's industrial revival. Members from border areas hoped that when engaging in agricultural and industrial construction, the border areas should not be ignored. They solemnly pointed out that there are many reasons for the troubles in the border areas, but the main reason is that we have no construction in these areas, which has caused the people in the border areas to develop centrifugal force due to their inclination towards the culture of other countries. Some even advocated not giving up the TVA plan.

The discussion then turned to the unreasonable problem of the financial sector's current policy of tightening loans to industry and mining under the pretext of preventing inflation. Xu Enzeng and others agreed with the "fixed currency method" proposed in the economic reform plan, that is, the state should lend to industry and mining and recover its finished products. In this way, on the one hand, it would support industry, and on the other hand, it would prevent loans from flowing into non-productive avenues. Shen Yi pointed out that the current economy has reached a most serious juncture, and the authorities should grant loans that are beneficial to society and sufficient to reverse the economic crisis, even if the loans may deepen inflation. Shen believes that the only goal of current construction should be to solve unemployment, so that those who are unemployed can find employment, and those who are employed can enjoy their work. This engineering expert, who is now the mayor of Nanjing, also used his own experience to criticize the tax law, saying: "It is a tragedy of the times that young people seek a way out by entering the officialdom." Gu Yuzhen put forward four points: 1. The economic crisis should not be remedied by patching up, but should be reformed. 2. Economic views should be centered on materials, not measured by legal tender. 3. Economic strongholds are military strongholds, and the military authorities should pay attention to economic strongholds. 4. Production should be coordinated, and consumption should be coordinated. Xia Guangyu further emphasized the importance of transportation in the economy and national defense, hoping that the authorities will pay attention to it.

Regarding the question of whether industrial construction should first select one or two relatively safe locations, concentrate all efforts on development, and then extend to other regions, or whether it should be developed in a decentralized manner, opinions in the meeting were clearly divided into two factions. Those who advocated developing in safe areas cited the destructive power of the atomic bomb as an example. Those who opposed it believed that industrial construction has various necessary conditions such as raw materials, transportation, and sales channels, and should not overemphasize safety and affect production.

The discussion then turned to how to absorb idle capital and overseas Chinese capital to engage in production, and how to use foreign capital. Regarding encouraging overseas investment in industrial construction, it was generally believed that the tendency of capital to hoard and profiteer, the unrest in the situation, the government's lack of a fixed policy for industry, and the lack of guarantees for industry were all related. All of these should be remedied. Xia Guangyu also suggested establishing regional design agencies in various regions to assist the work of the National Economic Commission. Zhong Jin, the inventor of the Chinese typewriter, based on his experience in the United States, proposed three points on the use of foreign capital and cooperation with foreign technology: 1. The use of foreign high-speed machinery technology has economic value. 2. The United States is the world's parts factory. 3. The state should concentrate its purchasing power in the domestic market. When Mr. Gao took the stage, the entire venue responded with warm applause, and the meeting did not end until 12:30.

Capital Construction Discussion

A special topic discussion was held at 2:00 pm, presided over by Shen Yi, titled "Basic Conditions for Promoting Capital Construction." Shen first proposed seven key points and expressed his views on the point "Why has capital construction failed to develop smoothly in the past?" Shen said: Since the city was established as the capital in 1927 and the Capital Construction Commission was established in 1929, it has been 20 years, and its construction has not developed as quickly as desired. Reviewing the reasons, there are three main categories: 1. General, the frequent military affairs in the country since the establishment of the capital, and the recent impact of domestic political economy. 2. Technical, such as the incomplete urban planning and the incomplete determination of construction procedures, which make the entire construction lack a basis for implementation and are limited to treating the symptoms. 3. Political, the lack of funding for construction, the inability of institutions to be dedicated, and the heavy overlap of general administrative procedures, making capital construction proceed amidst various constraints and difficult to achieve great success. Zhao Zukang, Lu Yuzheng, and others then spoke, and Tan Bingxun and four others were appointed to be responsible for the competition, convened by Shen Yi.

[Another dispatch] Various engineering societies held engineering conferences. In addition to the 26 papers from the two professional societies of municipal administration and sanitation, which were announced at 2:00 pm on the 4th, the rest were held on the afternoon of the 3rd, presided over by Wu Chengluo. Each group appointed a person in charge to serve as chairman. The papers included 4 from the Transportation Engineering Society, 22 from the Civil Engineering Society, 8 from the Hydraulic Engineering Society, 1 from the Architectural Engineering Society, 9 from the Mechanical Engineering Society, 10 from the Electrical Engineering Society, 8 from the Aviation Engineering Society, 7 from the Mining and Metallurgical Engineering Society, and 3 from the Textile Engineering Society. After the papers from each professional society were announced, they will select several of the best, and the authors and topics will be announced at the general meeting on the 4th.

At 8:00 pm on the 3rd, an engineering lecture was held, presided over by Gu Yuxian. Chen Zhongzhou, Xu Benchun, and Wu Xuezhou respectively lectured on the electrical, mining, and steel machinery industries in Northeast China. Member Gao Zhongqin lectured on the design and application of the electric Chinese typewriter.

The 4th is the third day. The morning is still for special topics, presided over by Wu Hongxun, titled "Reviewing the Obstacles to Construction Imposed by the Current System." In the afternoon, the two engineering societies of municipal administration and sanitation read papers, and the general meeting began discussing meeting affairs. In the evening, an engineering lecture was given, titled "Destruction and Restoration of National Railways."

### Discussing the Disposition of Former Italian Colonial Territories London Conference Opens Yesterday Egypt Submits Memorandum to the Four Powers

[United Press, London, 3rd] Sir Charles Peake, the British representative, presided over the opening of the Four-Power Conference on Italian Colonies here on the 3rd. He called for the rapid establishment of a Four-Power Commission to determine the wishes of the people of the colonies regarding their future political situation. Peake said that he did not see "any serious difficulty in this matter" and that "it must be easy to reach an agreement on a preliminary detailed plan." Peake did not say that the commission should be able to send representatives to Africa for inspection by November 15.

[Reuters, London, 2nd] Italian diplomats here are pessimistic about an early resolution of the former Italian colonies. They expect that the final resolution of the Italian territories will have to wait two years, with most of the time spent studying the local situation and investigating the opinions of the residents. They also expect that the Italian government's opinion will not be sought in the initial stages of the talks held outside the Four Powers, but they expect Rome to send experts to London to provide temporary opinions.

[Reuters, London, 2nd] On the eve of the start of discussions on Italian territories by the special representatives of the foreign ministers of the Four Powers, the Egyptian government submitted a memorandum to the four countries of the United Kingdom, the United States, the Soviet Union, and France, stating Egypt's views on this issue. In addition to supporting the demands of other Arab League countries to make Libya, with an area of 600,000 square miles, an independent Arab state, it also has some specific demands of its own for North Africa. The content has not yet been revealed. At the same time, Italian diplomatic sources here revealed that Italy hopes to be able to entrust the trusteeship of its former territories to it, so as to protect the lives of the 200,000 Italians who currently live there. The Allied countries can also show that they value Italy's money and manpower spent in developing these virgin lands over the past sixty years.

### Greece, Turkey, and Arab Countries Brewing Mediterranean Alliance Arab Proposes Egyptian Trusteeship of Italian Territories in North Africa

[Reuters, Cairo, 2nd] After returning here today from London and New York, Arab League Secretary-General Azzam received reporters and gave a speech, mentioning the possibility of uniting Greece, Turkey, and Arab League countries, and possibly adding Italy, to form a Mediterranean alliance. He said that the Arab League has not yet considered this proposal, but he personally believes that for the sake of peace, it is in favor of establishing a strong buffer between the two major ideologies. He believes that if this proposal can promote the maintenance of peace and eliminate the threat of new wars, no one will oppose the establishment of the Mediterranean Alliance. When Azzam mentioned the issue of Italian colonies, he expressed his disbelief that the Four Powers could reach an agreement on this matter, and declared that the Arabs would oppose the return of these lands to Italy. The Arabs and Italians have been fighting for twenty years, and allowing the Italians to return to their territories is tantamount to crowding out the Arabs who fought with the Allied countries. He also reiterated the Arab League's policy, which advocates the unification of Tripolitania and Cyrenaica, and entrusts them to Egypt for trusteeship if necessary.

### US Secretary of Defense Responds to Vyshinsky Says US Business Community Does Not Want War

[Associated Press, New York, 2nd] Secretary of Defense Forrestal declared last night that "the American business community does not want war, and neither does American labor." This statement was clearly in response to Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky's accusation at the United Nations General Assembly that a part of the American people were "merchants of war." Forrestal also said that the Marxist idea that industrialists are conspiring to brew a new war is nonsense. In fact, the American business community is investing in peace. In the past twenty months, American businesses have invested more than $20 billion in new factories, new stores, new public utilities, new transportation businesses, and new miners. This kind of production and distribution business specializes in manufacturing peacetime goods, and is intended for supplying the people of the country and exporting them to the world, and is not intended for manufacturing munitions.

### Taft Harshly Condemns US Government's Connivance with Chinese Communists

[Associated Press, Casper, Wyoming, USA, 2nd] Republican Senator Taft delivered his last campaign speech in the western states here today, criticizing the Democratic government's indecisiveness and lack of principles in handling domestic and foreign affairs. The State Department is disorganized and prone to infighting. He also said that he could not believe whether the government's policy was tending towards peace or war. In the past year, the State Department's actions have not followed a consistent line. On the one hand, it connives with the Chinese Communist Party, but on the other hand, it takes strong measures in Greece and Turkey. The State Department is so chaotic and contradictory that it still refuses to announce all the facts to the people or Congress.

[Associated Press, 3rd] Former Vice President Wallace declared here last night, "It is unwise for intelligent people like Taft to oppose the International Relief Plan, and it is even more shocking. Any 20th-century American who believes that it is impossible to maintain and improve the living standards of countries around the world is even more unimaginable."

### UN Committee Debates Greek Issue Ukraine Criticizes Britain and the United States Representatives of Bulgaria and Albania Attend to Defend

[This newspaper dispatch] New York, 4th Radio: Lake Success dispatch, The UN Political Committee met today to continue debating the Greek issue. The first speaker was the Ukrainian representative Manuilsky, who said, "The whole world knows that British troops are stationed in Greece, while Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, and Albania do not have a single soldier within Greek territory. The United States' accusations against the above three countries are clearly unfounded and purely lies. It must be known that the Greek civil war occurred because the British army supported the reactionary government and oppressed democratic elements."

[Reuters, Lake Success, 2nd] The UN Political Committee resumed its debate on the Greek issue today. Bulgarian representative Mivra accused the US government of deliberately using UN agencies to conceal its ambition to expand into the Balkans and the Near East. Mivra also criticized the report of the UN Balkan Investigation Committee, denying that Bulgaria had assisted the Greek guerrillas with weapons, money, or armed personnel. The Albanian representative then took the floor, accusing the Greek government of being fully responsible for creating tension between neighboring countries.

### Poland to Propose Abolition of Germ Warfare

[Associated Press, Lake Success, 2nd] It is reported that Poland will soon ask the United Nations to ban germ warfare, which is engaged in mass slaughter, because this war is more terrible and more difficult to control than the atomic bomb. It is said that this move will cause a wide response in the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission, because if the commission meets, the negotiations on this matter will be conducted in the commission.

In addition to making the commission a more intense battlefield than atomic control, germ warfare negotiations have a significant impact on the global balance of power, because this matter is of great importance to the deadlock caused by the issue of atomic energy between the Soviet Union and the Western powers. The United States apparently now has a monopoly on atomic energy and occupies a leading position in atomic negotiations. The situation is different for germ weapons. Every country has this weapon. Only a small bottle is enough to kill half of the world's population. It has long been no secret that the United Kingdom, the United States, France, and other countries had already produced methods of using germs to slaughter humans, livestock, and plants by the end of this war. The Soviet Union is lagging behind in this regard, and it is also a fact.

### Palestine Committee Listens to Jewish Opinions

[Associated Press, Lake Success, 2nd] Jewish Public Council of Palestine Representative Shertok, speaking today at the UN Palestine Committee, stated that the partition of Palestine, which is necessary for the establishment of a Jewish homeland in the region, means that the Jews are prepared to reluctantly accept the partition plan. But this solution requires considerable promotion by UN agencies, and the establishment of a UN international institution to supervise the partition of Palestine between the Arabs and Jews for a period of two years. According to an Arab spokesperson, no agreement was reached in the committee regarding any solution to partitioning, and Palestine should establish an independent and democratic Arab state, and the Arabs will fight to the end for their principles. Disputes also broke out at today's meeting, and it seems that there is no compromise on the positions of the Arabs and Jews.

[Reuters, Washington, 2nd] After holding a 35-minute talk with President Truman at the White House, French Foreign Minister Bidault issued a statement saying that France would not have the dollars needed to purchase necessary goods from the United States by November 1 of this year.

France's situation has become extremely critical, and new sources of dollars must be found in November and December, otherwise the French government will have to issue new restrictions to strictly limit the purchase of necessary wheat, coal, and industrial raw materials from the United States. Bidault also said that the 93 million dollars worth of German gold allocated by the Brussels Committee can only be maintained for a very short period of time and is not enough to alleviate the urgency of France's dollar needs.

According to the previous British-Soviet trade talks in Moscow, although the representatives of both sides considered them to be fruitless, the United Kingdom extended them for political reasons.

### Italian Political Situation Eases General Strike in Rome Avoidable

[Associated Press, Rome, 2nd] Undersecretary of the Interior Maraiche tonight declared that the general strike in Rome Province tomorrow can be avoided.

### Obstructing Resumption of Work and Destroying Trams: Ninety-Six Workers Arrested, Thirty-Eight Innocents Released, Four Thugs Handed Over to the Garrison Command, Tram Depot Nearly Attacked but Prevented by Suppression, Armed Protection Restores First Tram

[Report from this Newspaper] The French-owned tram workers' strike has dragged on for a week today. This morning, most employees obeyed orders and went to the tram depot to prepare to resume work. The Labor Union Readjustment Committee dispatched tram No. 17F at 8:00 AM, driven by Sun Jinxiang (Shandong native, 21 years old, residing at No. 23 Wangjia Lane, Daxilu), an unemployed worker of the British-owned tram company assigned by the Social Affairs Bureau, to pick up workers to resume work. Three policemen were assigned on the tram. While passing near the Navy Club at the intersection of Chongqing South Road and Ximen Road, suddenly over a hundred striking workers from Fuxing Park rushed out, armed with iron rulers and stones, and blocked the tram, smashing all the glass windows and severely beating Sun Jinxiang, causing injuries to his face and internal injuries. At that time, workers preparing to go to the depot to resume work were arriving one after another. Seeing the chaotic situation, they panicked and scattered to take cover. Meanwhile, the striking workers who had been lying in wait around the tram depot near Xujiahui Road and the post office on Jianguo West Road took the opportunity to gather and planned to rush to the company and depot. Over a hundred police officers from the 3rd squadron of the 1st police regiment, stationed at the depot for protection, were dispatched to suppress the unrest. At the same time, after receiving the report, the Police Headquarters immediately dispatched Garrison Section Chief Lu Dagong in a garrison vehicle, and twenty mounted patrol officers were also dispatched. Simultaneously, the Songshan and Lujiawan Police Stations also dispatched a large number of police officers to encircle and arrest suspected rioting workers. Ninety-six workers were arrested at the scene. Fifty-two of them were detained by the Songshan Police Station, and forty-four were detained by the Lujiawan Police Station. The surrounding area was placed under martial law, and traffic was cut off. Order was restored around 10:00 AM. Sun Jinxiang, who was injured, was sent to the hospital for treatment and then returned home to recuperate.

In the afternoon, Garrison Commander Xuan Tiewu went to the Lujiawan branch office to inquire about the incident. Branch Chief Chen Zhiqing gave a detailed account of what happened. Commander Xuan advised that, unless absolutely necessary, conciliatory measures should be used first. After a detailed interrogation of the arrestees that afternoon, it was found that eighteen workers detained by the Songshan Police Station and twenty workers detained by the Lujiawan Police Station were innocent. They were all going to the company to resume work and were arrested in the chaos. After the Social Affairs Bureau and the Labor Union provided proof to the police station, they were successively released on bail and ordered to return to the depot to resume work. Among them, four people were identified by the police officers present at the scene as having been involved in the assault. Because the circumstances were more serious, they were transferred to the Garrison Command's military court for investigation. The four people were: Zhao Niangen (17 years old, Shanghai native, Electricity Department). Li Guifu (26 years old, Longhua native, Repair Department). Yao Runquan (31 years old, Wujin native, Repair Department). Yu Guishi (26 years old, Zhenjiang native, Driver). The remaining fifty-four people detained by the police station are still under investigation.

Due to the obstruction, the French-owned trams were unable to leave the depot yesterday morning. The workers who were originally scheduled to resume work scattered in fright and were difficult to reassemble. The Labor Union Readjustment Committee was still actively seeking to restore transportation in the afternoon. At 4:10 PM, the first tram was dispatched, running between the Bund and Xujiahui, driven by an unemployed worker assigned by the Social Affairs Bureau, with armed police protection. Jeeps and motorcycles from the Garrison Command provided protection along the way. Subsequently, a total of thirteen trams on Route 2 were successively dispatched, returning to the depot at 9:00 PM. According to the Labor Union, it is planned to increase the number of operating trams to twenty today, departing from the depot at 5:00 AM. Social Affairs Bureau Director Wu Kaixian explained that the reason for only operating Route 2 was that the section between the Bund and Xujiahui has always been the main artery of the former French Concession, so maintaining transportation on that route was given priority. Other tram and trolleybus routes, as well as buses, will be restored as soon as workers resume work.

Regarding Sun Jinxiang, who was beaten and injured, Director Wu stated yesterday that the government had already sent his family a living allowance of five million yuan, and all medical expenses would also be borne by the government.

### Mayor Angrily Orders: Any Further Obstruction or Assault Will Result in On-the-Spot Execution

[Report from this Newspaper] Mayor Wu met with reporters in the Municipal Government conference room at 5:00 PM yesterday to report on the incident where over a hundred rioters obstructed the French-owned trams yesterday morning. He stated that the company and workers had requested the Social Affairs Bureau to extend the deadline for resuming work, and the municipal government has now approved the extension until 4:00 PM today. Anyone who has not resumed work by 4:00 PM this afternoon will be unconditionally dismissed. The French-owned tram company has scheduled to start registering new workers at 10:00 AM this morning. It is sincerely hoped that well-meaning workers will come to their senses in time.

Regarding the incident yesterday of rioters obstructing the tram: Mayor Wu was extremely angry and issued another order yesterday: "From now on, anyone who obstructs vehicles or assaults drivers will be executed on the spot without exception."

Government Attitude

Mayor Wu finally declared: "The ninety-six people arrested yesterday morning for obstructing the tram are being interrogated separately. Some are colluding with wanted criminals and will be dealt with according to military law. Those who were coerced into participating will also be charged with disrupting transportation and will be sent to court for prosecution. The government's attitude towards this labor strike is that public transportation cannot be disrupted for even a moment, and workers should consider the public interest. If workers have demands, they should formally apply to the authorities for mediation. If mediation fails, then arbitration should be used. Terrorist threats and other behaviors are not allowed. If subversive elements take the opportunity to stir up trouble, they will be dealt with according to the Central Government's measures for dealing with the Communist bandits."

### Worker Registration for Resumption of Work Extended to Today

[Report from this Newspaper] The authorities convened another important meeting at the Social Affairs Bureau conference room at 3:00 PM yesterday to address the French-owned tram worker strike. Mayor Wu, Wu Kaixian, Zhao Zengjue, Xun Shuping, Lu Jingshi, Zhao Banfu, Shen Ding, and the French manager of the company attended. After the meeting, Director Wu met with reporters, detailing the conflict this morning where striking workers obstructed trams from leaving the depot, and stated that those workers who have been arrested and proven to have committed assault will be severely punished. Director Wu continued to state several points: 1. Most workers have expressed to the company their willingness to resume work and have requested an extension of the deadline for resuming work (originally scheduled to end on the 3rd). This has now been approved and extended to 4:00 PM on the afternoon of the 4th. Anyone who fails to resume work by the deadline will be dismissed and replaced with new employees. All dismissed employees will be treated as voluntarily resigning, and all preferential treatment such as dismissal and retirement benefits will be canceled.

### Deploying Military Police to Protect Workers

In response to inquiries from workers' families about whether there would be effective guarantees after the workers resumed work, Mayor Wu resolutely stated that in order to maintain transportation and protect the jobs of well-meaning workers, the police will do their best to protect the workers who resume work and their families. If necessary, they will also be authorized to open fire on those who endanger the resumption of work. In addition, Commander Xuan has been requested to order the army and all military and police in the city to be deployed to provide protection.

### Registration and Recruitment of New Workers

The company will begin registering new workers starting at 10:00 AM on the 4th, with the assistance of the labor union and the protection of the government. Registration for recruiting new workers will continue until the quota is filled. The company raised the question of who would be responsible for the medical expenses and family living expenses of injured workers. It was decided to handle the workers in two categories. The first category is workers who resume work for the company. If they are injured, their medical expenses will be borne by the company. The living expenses of their families during the recovery period will also be borne by the company. The second category is workers assigned by the government who have not yet completed hiring procedures. If they are injured, their medical expenses and family living expenses will be borne by the government. In addition, both the government and the company are willing to provide appropriate subsidies to injured workers.

### Supervisor Yan from Jiangsu Returns from Northern Jiangsu with Great Emotion: The Performance of the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration is Not Even as Good as a Pancake Shop

Supervisor Yan Zhuang of Jiangsu Province, after inspecting Zhenjiang and Yangzhou counties, met with reporters yesterday and said: "The latent crisis of public security in northern Jiangsu is still extremely serious. If it is not overcome as soon as possible, the consequences will be dire. Currently, Communist bandits are as rampant as ever in the rural areas of northern Jiangsu, and order has not yet been stabilized. The military and political authorities should pay close attention. Regarding the corruption cases of the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, Yan expressed great emotion. He hopes that the government will take responsibility, make a firm decision, and severely punish corruption, and must not condone it out of favoritism. Yan pointed out that there are two points that are most heartbreaking about this case: 1. The Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration is such a large organization with such heavy responsibilities, it should be organized strictly and in an orderly manner. However, everything inside is as chaotic as [character unclear]. Almost all internal and external correspondence has not been registered and cannot be checked. How many electric fans were obtained from UNRRA has not yet been fully clarified. The management performance is not even as good as a pancake shop. 2. Most of the senior staff of the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration are medical students, and the middle-level staff are all university students. It is a great waste that such talented people have not been able to contribute to the country, and all have been misled and sacrificed by the corrupt and extravagant habits accumulated by the heads of the agency. This is a huge loss for China."

[Report from this Newspaper] According to sources from the Public Utilities Bureau, the gas price will definitely be adjusted within ten days, and the estimated increase will be approximately 100 percent.

[Report from this Newspaper] After taking over various branches, the Readjustment Committee of the Third District Department Store Workers' Union has been carrying out readjustment work very actively, which was initially very smooth. However, at 4:15 PM yesterday, a group of employees of the China National Goods Company on Nanjing Road suddenly closed the iron gates and put up slogans demanding the release of ten arrested workers and refusing to change the crude labor union, and went on strike.

### Unprecedented Great Structure: Monument to Victory in the War of Resistance: Symbolizes Our Country's Infinite Bright Future. Grand Opening Ceremony Scheduled for Double Tenth Day

[Reported from Chongqing, September 30th, by our newspaper] Chongqing – this wartime capital – is not only a strategically important city in southwestern China but also the command post that accomplished the great historical mission of leading eight years of bloody resistance to achieve victory. It was once honored as the "World Peace Lighthouse." The Monument to Victory in the War of Resistance on Minquan Road (formerly Duyou Street) is the only structure of historical significance. Its predecessor – the spiritual fortress of wartime – represents the spirit of the Chinese nation's inevitable victory in the war of resistance. Now, it symbolizes our country's great and bright future in building the nation after victory.

Preparation Process

The preliminary preparations were as follows: On October 31st of the year before the victory of the War of Resistance, in honor of President Chiang Kai-shek's 60th birthday, all sectors of the wartime capital initiated a monetary gift. Mayor Zhang Rui-lun, considering that our leader led the entire nation through eight years of arduous resistance to achieve victory and complete a monumental achievement, proposed, in order to commemorate this tragic history of national rejuvenation and to honor the soldiers and civilians who sacrificed their lives for the country, to use all the monetary gifts to build this "Monument to Merit" and establish the Victory Merit Monument Construction Committee, based on President Chiang's instructions in December of the 34th year of the Republic for a ten-year construction plan for the wartime capital. The project's budget was set at 500 million yuan for construction costs and 50 million yuan for equipment. Huang Bin-xun, Standing Committee Member of the Urban Construction Planning Committee, and specialist Liu Da-ren were responsible for planning. Architect Li Lun-jie from the committee designed the monument, and civil engineers Li Ji-fen, architects Tang Ben-shan, Zhang Zhi-fan, Guo Min-zhan, and others assisted. Electrical engineer Li Zong-yue handled the electrical equipment. The Tianfu Construction Factory won the bid for the construction project. Mayor Zhang presided over the groundbreaking ceremony on October 31st of the 35th year of the Republic, with the entire project scheduled for completion in eight months. The arduous work was carried out under conditions of scarcity of materials in the mountainous city. In order to economize due to economic constraints, the actual construction cost amounted to 188.3 million yuan and equipment costs totaled 19 million yuan. The entire project is expected to be completed by the end of this month. It is reported that it has been decided to hold the grand opening ceremony on Double Tenth Day this year. It is also learned that at the beginning of the ceremony, the municipal government will borrow 200 homing pigeons from the Central Police Academy in Chongqing, with colored paper strips tied to their feet, flying into the sky to create a magnificent spectacle. This initiative is also an unheard-of anecdote.

Great Appearance

The design of the Victory Monument is a high-rise octagonal tower, divided into a base, a pedestal, a body, and an observation deck. The entire monument is built on Duyou Street Square. Excluding the median strip and sidewalks, the area is a circle with a diameter of 20 meters. The base of the monument, with its granite and stone steps, forms a circle with a radius of 10.5 meters. The green stone platform is 1.6 meters high and includes flower beds on the steps. Pedestal: There are eight stone tablets made of high-quality Gorges stone produced in Beibei, inscribed with President Chiang's magnificent achievements and the epic of the eight-year War of Resistance. Eight cylindrical stone-carved pillars form the pedestal, with the stone tablets embedded on the outside. Body: The height is 24 meters, consisting of a cylindrical structure with a diameter of 4 meters. The interior is circular, and the exterior is octagonal. Each corner is paved with beige facing bricks. Inside, a cantilevered spiral staircase of 140 steps leads directly to the observation deck. Along the spiral staircase is the Victory Corridor of the War of Resistance, adorned with oil paintings of war heroes, great battles, and the Japanese surrender. Below, memorial stones donated by various cities and stone tablets donated by social celebrities are embedded. Observation Deck: Wider than the base, with a diameter of 4.5 meters, it can accommodate 20 visitors. The monument features a standard clock visible from all four sides, with four relief sculptures around the clock depicting the meritorious deeds of soldiers, sailors, airmen, and electrical engineers who contributed to the war effort and the productive labor of farmers and workers in the rear. The relief sculptures are made of reinforced concrete with a bronze color. The top of the observation deck is equipped with a weather vane, anemometer, compass, and related meteorological instruments. A large bell is suspended at the top for citywide celebrations, gatherings, or alarms.

Solid Construction

The entire structure is built with steel-reinforced concrete, with the exterior finished with white cement terrazzo. Each side has five windows, all with steel-reinforced concrete window grilles that have undergone air-raid protection treatment. As for the electrical equipment, it is divided into internal and external lighting. The internal lighting includes eight mercury solar lamps surrounding the top of the monument and one mercury lamp in each section. The external lighting consists of eight powerful searchlights projecting onto the monument from all directions, revealing the entire structure in eight soft beams of light. According to architect Tang Lun-jie, the monument, barring major external damage, should last for at least 300 years. Its solidity is comparable to that of a fortress, impervious to 500-pound bombs. The monument is bulletproof. The main door on the front of the monument is made of specially selected fine camphor wood. The entire monument used 25 tons of steel and over 900 barrels of cement. The architectural design is purely modern and mixed, making it China's only great memorial building of this scale, an unparalleled spectacle even for emerging buildings in the future.

Beacon of Light

In the fundraising for the construction, there were donations ranging from as little as 2,000 yuan to as much as hundreds of thousands of yuan, but they represented the hearts of millions of citizens and the collective crystallization of the arduous and unyielding struggle of the entire nation for eight years. It is the vanguard against aggression, the bastion against fascism. It has engraved for us the humiliation China has endured throughout its history, leading to a complete removal of this humiliation and leaping to become one of the nations leading the world towards peace. From afar, its solemn and dignified exterior and the grandeur of its architecture, with the soft yellow color reflecting the blue of the sky, demonstrate the sincerity, perseverance, and indomitable spirit of this nation with over 5,000 years of history. Finally, justice triumphed over might, and the dawn of peace arrived. Democracy could be maintained, and human justice could be upheld. It leaves an indelible impression on people. This Chongqing, known as the "World Peace Lighthouse," with its only historically significant Monument to Victory in the War of Resistance, will always stand so solemnly, like a giant standing tall, recounting to the nation a glorious history page of blood and tears. It has blown the horn of harmony that resonates with world peace and justice, calling on compatriots across the country to "Advance! Advance!" towards the great road of democracy and light!

### Ministry of Education Improves Comic Strips - Adopts Eight Steps Based on Research by the National Institute for Compilation and Translation - Coordinates with the Central Cultural Movement Committee to Promote Improvements in a Planned Manner

[Report from our newspaper, Nanjing, 3rd] In order to improve comic strips as social education material, the Ministry of Education instructed the National Institute for Compilation and Translation to formulate measures for improving comic strips. Currently, based on the institute's research results, the following steps are being adopted: There must be a dedicated editorial and review organization to handle the matter with full effort and seriousness. The prohibition measures should be greatly relaxed, and only the most harmful content should be deleted or prohibited. Stories of gods and heroes should not be rashly prohibited simply because they are considered superstitious. Select famous works that are more interesting to serve as the basis for comic strips. Establish contact with the original comic strip artists and provide them with the newly selected source material for their reference. Utilize existing distribution channels. Provide assistance to publishers, such as allocating paper and providing revolving funds. Encourage new artists to participate in this work. Once a large quantity of new, high-quality comics are published, the old, poorly made comics will naturally disappear without the need for prohibition. Items 4, 5, and 6 above are currently being piloted by the Institute for Compilation and Translation, and results are expected in the short term. Because the Central Cultural Movement Committee is also very concerned about this matter, the Ministry of Education has sent a letter requesting the institute to coordinate with them to promote improvements in a planned manner, in order to achieve effective results.

### Chinese Stocks Turn from Weak to Stable, Yongsha Rises Near Closing

The exchange of national banks was very high, and people's hearts suddenly improved. Then, the legend of the Securities Finance Company arose again, and the buying boom continued, gradually increasing. Near the closing, Yongsha even ended at a high price.

Morning

Slightly stable. Yongsha was sold to 266 yuan in deferred delivery after opening. At this time, Yongsha for immediate delivery was quite firm and rose back to 262 yuan for immediate delivery and 271 yuan for deferred delivery. The cloth market reported good sales, and the offshore interest rate opened low to 2 jiao, 2 and a half jiao, and 2 jiao 7. After 11:00 AM, it was even lower to 264 and a half yuan. As there were separate settlements, the existing delivery of Yongsha slightly recovered, but the pressure from large investors was high, and small and miscellaneous stocks were doubly weak. Near the closing, the price was forced down to 252 yuan for immediate delivery and 261 yuan for deferred delivery, and the market closed at prices of 252 and a half yuan and 262 yuan. Xinhua Zhongfang fell a lot, and Xin'a fell to the limit. As a result, compared with the previous closing price of immediate delivery stocks, Yongsha, Xinhuo, Huafeng, Xinguang, Zhongfa, Zhabei, Zhongsi, and Liana were slightly lower, Meiya, Jingfu, Qinxing, Innerwear, Rongfeng, Tongyi, and Hengfeng were half a percent lower, Xinhua Zhongfang fell 10%, Xin'a fell to the limit, and Commerce and Match, and Zhongxing were flat.

It was rumored that the Securities Finance Company would improve from the next period onwards. The market rose continuously. Yongsha closed at a high price of 269 yuan for immediate delivery and 274 and a half yuan for deferred delivery. The bidding was slightly higher after the closing.

### Foreign Stocks Steady, Unified Bonds Suspended Yesterday

Securities banks had supply, and Guang banks bought slightly. Jardine opened at 129,000 in the morning and closed at a high price of 130,500 yuan in the afternoon. Compared with the previous closing, Wheelock and Hong Kong & Kowloon Wharf fell slightly, Telephone was flat, and the remaining stocks rose slightly.

Public bonds were suspended yesterday because there were problems with the 500,000 notes of Unified B at Room 550, and industry is working to resolve it.

Chinese stocks in the previous market were still turbulent amidst the labor unrest. There was little trading, and the market remained depressed, continuing to show low prices. Yarn and cloth were popular again, so the Guang bank and a certain foreign bank suspended trading for one day. The black market price of Unified B was still around 16,000 yuan.

### Stable Rice Prices

Yesterday, a total of over 12,600 shi of rice arrived at the North and South markets combined.

The North market was initially weak but then strengthened, with indica rice showing strength and japonica rice softening, and white glutinous rice remaining average.

Flour was initially weak but then tightened. Factory flour remained similar, but both standard flour and mixed-brand flour decreased by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Imported flour was scarce and easy to sell, and the market remained strong. Flour allocation needs to be decided today. Bran sales were average and uneventful, with a slight decrease of 300 to 500 yuan. Soybean cakes and soybean oil showed no movement, gradually declining downstream, with a sharp drop of 4,000 to 5,000 yuan. Both yellow soybeans and soybean cakes fell in price, and factories showed no interest in buying. Retail sales were average, and the market trend softened.

Mung beans had low supply and demand, and the situation was mediocre. Broad beans saw slow sales and remained unchanged for now. Field peas from Southeast Asia were slightly sought after, and the market remained firm. Wheat remained firm, while red sorghum saw weak demand, with prices apparently steady but secretly weakening. Corn digestion was sluggish, and prices fell by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Sesame seeds had abundant supply but slow sales, with prices decreasing by 10,000 yuan. New and old sesame kernels moved in opposite directions. New goods from out-of-town merchants were still acceptable, with prices remaining firm at 10,000 yuan, while old goods saw weak demand.

The oil market had both firm and weak aspects. Crude oil remained firm due to high prices in production areas. Soybean oil and refined oil both saw a slight rebound of 10,000 yuan, while rapeseed oil was short of buyers, with a sharp drop of 30,000 to 40,000 yuan. Sesame oil also fell by 20,000 to 30,000 yuan.

Chinese Medicine Rises

Chinese medicine was affected by the high foreign exchange rates. Goods from Southeast Asian islands became more expensive, leading to an increase in the price of pepper to 85,000 yuan per jin, crude Shanxi fennel to 8,000 yuan, old-grade frankincense to 120,000 yuan, and Indian-grade frankincense also rising to 50,000 yuan.

### China Farmers Bank Allocates Autumn Cocoon Funds; Over 94 Billion Reached

The autumn cocoon loan arranged by the China Farmers Bank under orders has reached 94.855 billion yuan in remittances from the bank to date. This includes 59.287 billion yuan for Jiangsu Province and 35.568 billion yuan for Zhejiang Province. The actual loan amounts disbursed in the cocoon-producing areas of the two provinces are currently being compiled, and although not yet fully sent to Shanghai, it is expected that the total loan amount disbursed will be less than the amount remitted. The main reason for this is that the autumn weather this year has been hot and dry, resulting in sparse moisture in the mulberry leaves, and the active grasshoppers have affected the autumn cocoon harvest. In addition, rising rice prices have made it easier for silkworm farmers to turn their fresh cocoons into homemade silk. According to government regulations, the purchase price of fresh cocoons is 1.08 million yuan per dan (based on a standard of 460 jin for reeling quality and 300 jin for drying quality). Manufacturers add an additional 340,000 yuan per dan for expenses, for a total of 1.42 million yuan, while the purchase price for manufacturing homemade silk is much higher than this amount. It is reported that before the government had approved the purchase price, manufacturers were paying high prices to snap up cocoons in order to save time, and the government will not recognize this difference. To compensate for the factory's losses, the Design Committee under the Silk Production and Marketing Coordination Council previously discussed the matter, and it is expected that this issue will be decided at the Coordination Council meeting this morning (the 4th).

### Taiwan Dollar Weak; Black Market Exchange Rate Lower Than Official Rate

The exchange rate of the Taiwan dollar against the legal tender has been adjusted several times in the past three months, from 40 yuan to 44 yuan, 51 yuan, 65 yuan, and finally 72 yuan. However, despite repeated adjustments, the local demand for legal tender has increased, and there is still a shortage of cash, so the black market exchange rate is lower than the official rate. This is because local merchants are absorbing legal tender to purchase smuggled imports from South China, and they also need legal tender to apply for foreign exchange to order goods from abroad, which once caused remittances between Shanghai and Taiwan to be suspended. Recently, the Taiwan Industrial and Commercial Bank of Changhua, started accepting remittances at 80% of the official rate. One Taiwan dollar is converted into 57.6 jiao of legal tender, but it is said that there are still not many remitters.

In the afternoon, due to the increase in yarn prices, out-of-town manufacturers showed some interest in buying, causing prices to rise, and the final selling price was 6.2 million yuan.

Factory Silk

Due to oversupply, the listed prices of all grades in yesterday's market were cut by about 500,000 yuan. Grade 5 silk still lacked trading, with a bid price of 45 million yuan for C-grade, but a counter-offer of 4.5 million yuan was not successful. Retail prices ranged from 3 million to 4 million yuan.

[Our Report] The Cotton Yarn Adjustment Committee raised the negotiated price of cotton yarn again yesterday, with 20-count yarn listed at 15.2 million yuan, an increase of 700,000 yuan compared to the previous price. The prices of other counts of yarn were determined by referring to market conditions and proportional calculations.

Yesterday's cotton yarn market opened steadily, but later, due to the loosening of the money market and increased demand from local and Tianjin merchants, and especially because the Cotton Yarn Adjustment Committee raised the price of 20-count coarse yarn by 700,000 yuan and 42-count fine yarn by 1.3 million yuan, the market sentiment was strengthened, and the desire to buy was strong, with prices rising across the board.

Cotton Cloth Skyrockets

Yesterday's cotton cloth market suddenly skyrocketed again, with all types of cloth reaching new highs. It is reported that Tianjin merchants are heavily buying Sunshine Fine Cloth, because the price in that area is 100,000 yuan higher per bolt than in Shanghai, and there is also an exchange rate difference that can be exploited. It is also rumored that transportation to the north may be opened up, and the negotiated price of cotton yarn has also increased. The industry has not opened goods from China Textile Construction for two periods, the market has insufficient supply, and the buying interest is very strong, with the market sentiment boosted, and the prices are strong.

### China Trust Stops Purchasing 1947 Tea

[Our Report] According to China Trust Bureau news: Regarding the 1947 tea, tea merchants previously requested the government to purchase it. However, due to changes in foreign exchange measures and improved export difficulties, and the Agricultural Bank has relaxed the amount of tea pledge loans, the government has decided to stop purchasing the 1947 tea. The Central Trust Bureau has received an order from the Four Banks Joint Office to stop purchasing.

### Rediscovering the True Meaning of Love for Those Who Have Lost Love

Xu Yijun: Your letter has been received. We, of course, express our deepest sympathy for your situation. Judging from your letter, your love seems to be the type of "love at first sight." Young men and women often easily fall in love due to temporary emotional impulses, without mutual understanding or knowledge. The foundation of this kind of "love" is often very unstable. In the second month after you entered university, you started a "friendship" with her, and soon you both swore "to grow old together." This kind of "lightning-fast" love often does not have good results.

She wrote to you saying that her parents opposed this marriage, and therefore she became indifferent to you. If she truly loved you, things would never be so simple.

Love is a part of the process of life, not the whole of life. Success in love is certainly gratifying, but losing love is not necessarily tragic. The vast world will never be without a place for you. You should expand your "love" to the vast number of people, and entrust your spirit to your future career. We believe you will definitely be able to let it go. Wishing you progress (Editor) (Letters to the editor are published in this column on Sundays)

Spring and Autumn

### Recent Portuguese Theatre

— Zhao Jingshen

The background of Portuguese theatre is existentialism. The so-called existentialism (Existentialism) is nothing more than the meaning of "living to survive," enthusiastic, clamorous, and forward-rushing. Merchants are cautious and have few illusions, and they cannot understand abstract theories. They call art coquettish, a demand for beauty. So-called survival is "bullfighting, women, and wine." Most recently, the national drama is about wandering singers. They sing heartbreaking ballads, and the Portuguese sit around and listen all night.

Like every capital on the European continent, Lisbon boasts a national theatre. Its Corinthian architectural facade is a lifeless imitation of Paris and London. Occasionally, it performs a Greek classical play "Antigone" or a Portuguese classical ethical play, otherwise it performs the outdated "Lady Windermere's Fan."

Compared to popular entertainment, so-called international drama can only be considered barren. However, there is one comedian, Francisco Ribeiro, who is worth mentioning. He believes that Portugal's real drama can be powerful and universal. He sincerely believes in the theatrical tastes of his countrymen. Several years ago, he organized a troupe called the People's Theatre, with two one-act plays by Pirandello and Maeterlinck's "Interior." These dramas were very successful, more effective than any domestic comedy. The farmers opened their mouths in surprise and watched until the end.

Three years ago, Ribeiro ran the Trinidad Theatre in Lisbon, revealing the sign of "the voice of freedom." Immediately, half a dozen of the best actors from the National Theatre ran to his camp. At that time, people in the city had rarely heard of Ibsen and Pirandello, "A Midsummer Night's Dream" had just been discovered, and he continued to perform Shaw, Hauptmann, Giraudoux, and Sartre with redoubled efforts. The plays currently being prepared include dramas from England, Russia, the United States, and Spain.

For small countries wanting to perform international dramas, the biggest problem is translation. The situation in Lisbon is complicated, and most intellectuals are not free. Ribeiro had to do the translation himself.

Ribeiro calls his theatre "the comedians of Lisbon." He calls all the theatre troupes in Latin-speaking countries "comedians," and actors from different troupes can exchange with each other. For example, the comedians of Madrid, the theatre actors of Rome, etc. In this way, it can soon become a vast international theatrical union.

There is also a small theatre, crowded with audiences, making people feel suffocated, and the order is chaotic. This is Lisbon's standard performance of Portuguese plays. People from the wrestling arena sit in the front row, throwing kisses to friends on stage. It is almost equal to a performance for art lovers.

The Portuguese popular theatre, which is also standard, recently had a successful opera called "The Washerwoman." The stables, hay, harnesses, and two skinny donkeys are all real. The skills of Portuguese farmers will be close to the art of Moscow.

### Literary Quotes - Eastern Haze

Generally, in my opinion, the task placed before writers of our time is this: we must learn to write works that can be understood by the majority of mankind. We must guide the public to develop an interest in literature.

Therefore, we must write clear, concise, and as simple as possible works. — Zuo Qinke

### Under the Five Pavilion Bridge - Twenty-One Continuing the Yangzhou Dream

— Hong Weifa

The things that Yangzhou people who love to visit Slender West Lake love about it will vary depending on their temperament, learning, and age. Take the author as an example: when I was studying in elementary school, after school in the afternoon, I would often gather three or five classmates and run and jump all the way to the opposite bank of Little Golden Hill. Spending one or two copper coins, we could all cross the river and climb straight up to the Fengting Pavilion on the back hill. Looking around at the vastness, we would sing a song loudly or shout a few times wildly, and then hurry back. At that time, the Fengting Pavilion on Little Golden Hill should have been the thing that I loved the most. Later, I occasionally dabbled in writing, seeming to have a fondness for literature and art, but in reality, I only tried things superficially. However, I did acquire quite a few literati habits because of this. Therefore, when visiting Slender West Lake, I would prefer to steer a small boat alone, forlornly heading towards the misty waters. To put it more elegantly, it was to search for poetic inspiration, but in reality, it was just to satisfy my secluded thoughts and give free rein to my imagination. Also, because I don't like crowds, I am too lazy to mingle with the many tour boats, and I especially dislike seeing the vulgar monks in the mountain temples who say "Please come in and sit" and "Have some good tea." Therefore, I would never hold a banquet at Little Golden Hill, Xu Garden, or Fahaizi Temple to show my boldness. But regardless of how it is, the area under the Five Pavilion Bridge in Slender West Lake is always a place that everyone loves very much. It seems that it does not vary depending on temperament, learning, or age.

The "Yangzhou Painting Boat Records" says: "Four Bridges Misty Rain, also known as Huang Garden, is Huang's villa." It also says: "Four Bridges Misty Rain is the name of the garden. The four bridges are: Rainbow Bridge, Changchun Bridge, Chunbo Bridge, and Lotus Bridge. The Rainbow, Changchun, and Chunbo Bridges are all of the usual design. The Flower Bridge has five pavilions built on it, supported by four wings. Each wing has three gates, which together with the main gate make fifteen gates. The gazetteer says that there is a Wang Ban among the four bridges, but there is no Rainbow Bridge. Today's Jade Tablet Bridge is a small bridge next to Changchun Ridge, and is not within the four bridges." I was born late, and have not seen the Jade Tablet Bridge and Chunbo Bridge mentioned in the Painting Boat Records. I have only seen the Rainbow Bridge, Changchun Bridge, and Lotus Bridge. This Lotus Bridge is what is commonly called the Five Pavilion Bridge, because it "has five pavilions built on top." However, before 1933, it had been in disrepair for many years, and the five pavilions on the bridge had collapsed one after another, to the point that there were no pavilions at all. For a time, tourists jokingly called it the No Pavilion Bridge. In 1933, local people such as Wang Boling advocated repairing the bridge, and organized the Rebuilding Yangzhou Five Pavilion Bridge Committee. They raised several thousand yuan, and also moved bricks, tiles, and timber from the imperial palace in the city, and only then were the five pavilions on the bridge rebuilt. To this day, there is still a stone inscription written by Wang commemorating the rebuilding of the Five Pavilion Bridge, placed on the bridge.

Because there are five pavilions on this bridge, it is quite interesting to occasionally stand at the head of the bridge and look at the surrounding scenery, the tour boats under the bridge, unafraid of the scorching sun and unconcerned about sudden rain. But in the end, it is not as good as the hidden paradise inside the bridge opening. The "supported by four wings, each wing has three gates" mentioned in the Painting Boat Records means that in each of the three gates in each wing, which is the bridge opening, two small tour boats, or one large tour boat, can fit. In reality, not many large tour boats enter, because at most they can only enter halfway, and the stern of the boat must be left outside. Therefore, this hidden paradise is mostly exclusively occupied by small tour boats.

After the tourists have steered their small tour boats inside, they can lie on rattan chairs and take a nap. Good wind blows in from the three gates. No matter how scorching the sun is outside, it is always a cool world inside. The main gate of the bridge is the necessary path for visiting Ping Shan Tang. Intentionally or unintentionally greeting the passing boats inside is also a good place to enjoy the scenery and express one's feelings. Furthermore, the rising and falling of the songs played on water and the swaying of the willows along the river are particularly pleasing to the ear and delightful to the eye.

However, although these bridge openings can accommodate two small tour boats, if one has already entered, taking the early advantage, then the latecomers will mostly stop outside, or just look from afar and leave. Therefore, the so-called "four wings" under the Five Pavilion Bridge do not become too noisy. Anyway, those who steer their boats into the bridge openings do so to avoid the noise, to enjoy the coolness, and perhaps to talk about love. Those who are determined to tour the lake or want to join in the fun do not want to steer inside. Even if they do go in and stop, they will leave after a very short period of time.

I have lived an unsettled life. The older I get, the less time I spend in Yangzhou. Whenever I recall the scenery of my hometown, I always think of the area under the Five Pavilion Bridge first. But how can I have more free time to allow my small boat to avoid the dust and enjoy the coolness under it again!

### Precipice and Valley

— Qian Jinxi

Have you ever picnicked with your friends under the emerald green shade of trees on a misty mountain? Have you ever stood between mountain peaks, opening your mouth wide to listen to your echo? Perhaps you, like a geologist, explored the rocks, or perhaps you were a hunter searching for the burrows of porcupines and rabbits. If you were a mischievous child, you would climb to the treetops and gaze into the distance.

I also love to wander among the misty ridges. I love those old pines, which remind me of ancient old men playing chess on stones beneath the pines, savoring life. I love those flowing springs, which remind me of a platinum necklace on the chest of a girl in a green cheongsam. I love the treacherous passes, the places where brave soldiers defend the territory with machine guns. Listening to the myriad songs of the orioles, I feel as if I am in an opera house; watching the thousand kinds of flowers dancing, I suspect that I am in the Jade Bamboo Garden overseas.

And today, along that winding path, constantly pulling my clothes from the thorns, I came to a peculiar cliff.

This is precisely the precipice, looking down upon a thousand-foot sheer wall, a deep valley of loss, full of thorny jujubes and hazelnuts, like an ancient well.

Let's call it a thousand-foot sheer wall; yet on the mountain wall, there are still some rocky corners that can be grasped, but the eroded stones seem as if they will fall with just a gust of wind and rain. Who would dare climb down the mountain to explore the secluded and strange valley?

But no, children who love stories, timid children, brave people fear nothing.

Let me weave a story for you! I don't know what era it was, but in these mountains, a beautiful princess and a valiant knight were hunting side by side.

The knight was brave because he had love in his heart. Love encouraged him, love guided him, love made him unafraid of all difficulties.

They hunted many wild rabbits, pheasants, and turtledoves. A peacock dancing with seven-colored feathers attracted them. They chased after it, chased after it, all the way to the edge of the cliff.

At the edge of the cliff, the princess shot it with a feathered arrow, and the magnificent bird fell straight into the valley, hanging on the branch of a small tree, the mountain wind fluttering its colorful feathers.

"What a beautiful peacock," the princess sighed, "We chased it for so long! But we can't get it, can we?"

"No, we can get it." The knight's reply was very brave.

"Unless it flies up again." A humorous, almost sad smile.

The dead peacock would certainly not fly up again, but the living knight would fly down! Disregarding the princess's dissuasion, he jumped off his horse and climbed down into the valley. He was as agile as a startled eagle, as swift as a swallow, his golden armor flashing with sparkling light. He finally obtained the peacock.

Coming up, presenting the peacock to the princess, the princess smiled, a gentle smile. She discovered that the most beautiful thing in the world was not the peacock's colorful feathers, but the knight's heroic posture.

Oh! You might be eager to speak, ... Is it that the princess wanted to admire that precious heroic figure again, and threw the peacock back into the valley.

And... the knight thus became a perpetual guest of the valley!

Oh! Child, don't think that way! Isn't that too tragic? Don't be so melancholic! I tell you, that princess had a kind heart. She happily accompanied the knight back, vowing never to come to this cliff again to look down, nor to allow the knight to explore the secluded traces of the valley again.

Thus, this cliff became even more desolate—look, haven't I turned around because I felt too lonely?

### An Inch of Mountain, A River of Blood

— Ye Jingfeng

"Miss Ji...!" A sharp yet turbid voice shouted loudly behind Yaoqun at this moment.

Yaoqun was startled and quickly stopped and turned around. At the same time, this strange voice struck her eardrums, triggering her memory – that half-man, half-woman transvestite!

"Miss Ji, you don't need to look for them. I know their 'nest'! Turning around…"

"Hmm? Oh... Oh!..." Yaoqun was even more surprised: How could this fellow suddenly greet her like this? …And how could he guess what was on her mind?

"Sorry... 'You, this one'!" Yaoqun paused at this point. She seemed unwilling to call him "Miss" or "Madam," judging by the monster's voice, like an amateur opera singer playing a female role, squeezing his vocal cords and pinching his nose to produce that sharp voice. Beneath the sharp sound, a trailing note.

"Have we met somewhere?" Although Yaoqun hesitated, she still completed this challenging sentence, and straightened her eyebrows, and opened wide her eyes, clear and shining. In other words, she wanted to say, "Who do you think you are?" or "Do you know who your ancestors are?" This Northeast daughter was showing her temper.

"Where we've met, I'll tell you later..." My name is Mai Shafu, surname Mai, given name Shafu..." Saying this, he cracked open two thick, wide lips in a smile, revealing several large, crooked front teeth and half-exposed purple-black gums. Because his lips and gums were purple-black, it was necessary to describe them truthfully, otherwise one could borrow the phrase "blood basin mouth" to describe them, wouldn't that save ink?

After introducing himself, this fellow flashed to the outside of the gate, brushed past Yaoqun, stepped down a step, and without waiting for Yaoqun to speak, he put away that smile, worth a thousand gold pieces and scaring people to death, and with a taut face, said immediately: "I still have to hurry up and say a few words to them! At most three to five minutes, I'll come back and ask you about something... Please wait a moment, we're all on the same line, don't be afraid!..." While speaking, he stepped back down the steps; after speaking, he turned to leave, but after taking two or three steps, he seemed to remember something again, twisted his tiger neck, raised his hand and waved to Yaoqun, his fingers, like carrot sticks, were imitating the style of a beauty's orchid fingers; just as he was waving, two delicate words slipped out from his teeth: "Bye-bye!" After "Bye-bye," he smiled again.

An ancient song says: "A smile back turns a hundred graces born, the six palaces of powdered faces pale!" But this fellow's smile simply shook the mountains and moved the seas, changing the color of heaven and earth.

It stands to reason that Yaoqun should have taken this opportunity to use her skills to sneak and hide, follow him, and hang on his tail to see what he was up to, because in the current situation, the other party's actions were hidden, while she was in plain sight; every move was in their eyes. This is the biggest taboo in secret operations. But Yaoqun didn't do that. She knew that when you meet a strong enemy, the most important thing is to reverse "light" and "dark"; at least, to investigate the other party's background and actions clearly in order to respond. But in these short three to five minutes, how easy is it to investigate this fellow's actions!
