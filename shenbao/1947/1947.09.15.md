### Government Publishes Document Sent to Special Envoy Willkie: Explaining Steps Taken to Stabilize Politics and Economy, Determined to Overcome Crisis and Complete Constitutional Governance

[This City News] Our government submitted a memorandum to Special Envoy Wendell Willkie on August 16, explaining the steps taken to stabilize politics and the economy, and its determination to overcome the current crisis and promote constitutional governance. (1) The armed forces of the Communist Party must be eliminated. (2) Controlling inflation is imperative and cannot be delayed any longer. (3) In provinces not affected by Communist disaster, economic recovery should be accelerated, and local governments should simultaneously implement necessary reforms. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs simultaneously released the document in Nanjing and Shanghai yesterday (the 14th). The original text is as follows:

After General Albert Wedemeyer arrived in China, he submitted a memorandum to our government, stating: Based on past events, the Chinese government implemented various constructive measures in politics, economy, education, and social welfare between 1927 and 1937. Had it not been for the obstruction of the war, the aforementioned measures would have surely enabled China to become a strong and unified nation. To facilitate his mission, he deeply wished that the Chinese government would provide a memorandum explaining the steps taken to restore political and economic stability after the victory. Therefore, the Chinese government submitted the following memorandum to General Wedemeyer on August 16.

General Statement Regarding Measures and Policies of the Chinese Government

1. On the day of the victory, the Chinese government faced the following problems:

(1) The problem of the Chinese Communist Party. In addition to possessing a regular army of 310,000 men, they also had so-called "people's militias," whose numbers were even greater. A large number of un-surrendered and un-disarmed Japanese and puppet troops existed in the Northeast, providing the Chinese Communists with the opportunity to acquire more sophisticated equipment.

(2) The inflation caused by the long-term war of resistance endangered the economic life of the entire country.

(3) More than 90 percent of China's railways were completely shut down, and inland river shipping was extremely scarce. As a result, the work of repatriation and restoring order in the Japanese-occupied areas was very difficult. Many of the pre-war industrial and mining factories had been recovered, but many were unable to resume operation as a result.

(4) After eight years of neglect and destruction by the enemy and puppets, the rural economy suffered from a widespread shortage of labor, livestock, and fertilizer, resulting in a sharp decline in agricultural production that urgently needed to be restored. For example, annual cotton production fell from 16,180,000 piculs in 1937 to 5,320,000 piculs, only one-third of pre-war production.

(5) There were more than one million Japanese troops in mainland China, and approximately the same number in the Northeast. Six hundred thousand puppet troops were distributed throughout mainland China, and another 330,000 lived in the Northeast. Due to the Soviet Union's participation in the Far Eastern War, the Soviet Union also had 600,000 to 700,000 troops stationed throughout the Northeast.

(6) Finally, there was the issue of fulfilling the government's pre-war and wartime political promises: the convening of the National Assembly, the drafting of a constitution, the Kuomintang's return of power to the people, the end of one-party rule, and the abolition of the press censorship system were all major promises that the government urgently needed to fulfill.

The above-mentioned difficult problems were all issues that the government had to address simultaneously on the day of Japan's surrender. The magnitude of the responsibility was beyond the capacity of the government's existing institutions at the time. These problems were not only important and complex in themselves, but many were also things that the government had never experienced before.

### Resistance to Both Hinders, Reconstruction Difficult

2. When the Chinese government sent Japanese soldiers and expatriates back home, and transported troops by sea and air to various places to expedite the takeover work, it received assistance from the US military stationed in China. The United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration and the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration made significant contributions to the repatriation of refugees and other urgent relief and rehabilitation matters. At the same time, the Chinese government itself had done its best within the limits of what the environment allowed to seek solutions to various problems. First, it began to reorganize the army and tighten finances. Second, it sought to restore transportation, such as railways, highways, waterways, public utilities, and water conservancy projects. Third, it devoted itself to the resumption of industrial and mining operations and steel plants (including those dismantled by the Communist army or destroyed by the Communist Party in the Northeast), and to the rescue of the textile industry and other industries on the verge of collapse. Fourth, it devoted itself to the establishment of grassroots political organizations, such as the organization of local villages and towns, and the restoration and reconstruction of schools at all levels. Fifth, the government had also done its best to help the rural economy recover. As far as cotton is concerned, the government's promotional work over the past year and a half is expected to increase cotton production to 11 million piculs this year, doubling the year of victory in the War of Resistance. All these efforts require a lot of talent, management and economics.

If we judge the government's work during this period, we must remember that the foundation of Chinese society was not sound, and most of its land had been occupied for many years. The initial new economic foundation established before the war, that is, since 1927, was also destroyed by the enemy. After the victory, its recovery work was very difficult and complex.

If the government's efforts in repatriation and construction were not hindered by the existence of the following two major obstacles, it would have achieved greater results, and China's current political and economic situation would have been brighter. The so-called two major obstacles are the long-standing and unresolved issue of the Communist Party and the inflation left over from the war.

The Chinese Communist Party's participation in the Northeast during and after the Soviet occupation of the Northeast constituted a major factor in the stalemate of the Communist Party issue after the victory. The Communist Party's armed hostility was the biggest obstacle to the government's repatriation work and the restoration of public order, especially in the recovered areas. For example, while the government tried to restore major transportation lines in many ways, the Communist Party's army tried its best to carry out sabotage, demolishing newly repaired railways, cutting telegraph and telephone lines, and ravaging the countryside.

The Communist Party's attitude became increasingly tougher because the government failed to receive the surrender and disarm the Japanese and puppet troops in the Northeast. After the National Assembly was convened at the end of last year, the Communist Party openly opposed the constitution passed by the assembly, and the path to a political solution was clearly hopeless. At this time, the Communist Party had decided to launch a large-scale military offensive immediately. At a time when various construction projects required the government to concentrate its attention and start quickly, it encountered this situation, and the government's difficulties and disappointments were beyond description.

Since the Communist Party issue was unresolved, the military reorganization plan could not be realized because the Communist Party refused to implement it. The downsizing of the army could not but be hit, and as a result, the fiscal austerity policy could not be implemented, and inflation continued to rise, endangering the entire political and economic life of China. The government's administrative efficiency was reduced, and the morale of the army was affected. The salaries of most civil servants could not even maintain the minimum standard of living. Some government personnel were forced to take on other jobs to maintain their livelihood, while others simply abandoned their positions and switched to other positions with higher incomes. To this day, the treatment of civil servants who have been impoverished for a long time has not been effectively improved. However, the vast majority of civil servants still diligently perform their duties despite such difficult living conditions, which is truly amazing. The loyalty of these civil servants is comparable to the perseverance of the Chinese people in enduring suffering during the war of resistance.

### Establishing a Constitutional System, the Government Has Never Interrupted or Slacked Off, In Terms of Method, There May Be Some Shortcomings

3. The National Government can be criticized in various ways, but it cannot be accused of not having done its best to prepare for the democratic politics planned by Dr. Sun Yat-sen. All responsible people in the Kuomintang have always believed that if the Kuomintang cannot establish a government representing the entire people and allow the existence of multiple parties, it cannot be said that it has implemented the Kuomintang's basic party platform. Everyone who has a slight position in the party believes that once the basic conditions indicated by Dr. Sun Yat-sen are met, "political tutelage" must end. The entire Kuomintang has never deviated from this basic political belief.

When the Sino-Japanese War broke out in 1937, the entire country, from top to bottom, not only resolutely resisted the enemy, but also did its best to preserve the foundation established in politics and economy since 1927. The general opinion in the Kuomintang was that although the war existed, the Kuomintang's previous preparations for constitutional governance could not be destroyed by the war. Therefore, in 1938, the government convened the National Political Council to obtain more opinions to help promote national policies. Except for those related to military strategy, the council became the national public opinion organ during the war. At a time when the nation was struggling for life and death, the Kuomintang opened up the government in advance and accepted external public inquiries and criticisms. To this day, this system of making public affairs known to public opinion continues to develop. Although the 200 members of the first National Political Council were selected by the National Government based on occupation and geographic distribution principles, the general public recognized that they could truly represent all politically conscious strata of the country. When the second National Political Council convened in early 1940, there were 240 councilors, more than 90 of whom were elected for the first time by the provisional provincial and municipal councils based on geographic and occupational foundations. When the third National Political Council convened in 1942, 164 of the 240 members were elected by the provinces and cities. Currently, as the council is about to end, there are 362 councilors, of which 227 were elected by the provincial and municipal councils.

In September 1938, two months after the opening of the first National Political Council, the National Government promulgated the Provisional Provincial Council Regulations. These councils have now been established in almost all provinces, and the number of their elected members has been increasing in each session. Currently, the councilors of some provinces are entirely elected by the people. Municipal and county councils have also been established according to similar methods. Therefore, when the country was at war and military affairs were paramount, the government continued to do its best to establish and promote the constitutional system, without ever interrupting or slacking off.

After Japan surrendered, although there were many reasons for the continued existence of the press censorship system, the government resolutely abolished it. In November 1946, it convened the National Assembly again and passed the draft constitution. Although the Kuomintang was still the majority party in the government, the one-party government came to an end. The Youth Party and the Democratic Socialist Party have joined the government. In today's China, the expression of national public opinion has many organizations, which is unprecedented. Observers who are familiar with China's past situation will be able to notice this. This phenomenon is due to the abolition of press censorship, the convening of the National Assembly, the participation of other parties in the government, the implementation of the Executive Yuan's responsibilities, and the public discussions of the National Political Council. At the same time, the government's love for its policies and administration is sufficient to promote the development of public opinion and bring the government and the people closer together.

Since the Kuomintang came to power, in order to achieve its political goals, there may be some shortcomings in the method, but the Kuomintang has never deviated from its consistent political direction. The progress of its work may inevitably be delayed due to the difficulties of the environment, but in the 20 years of the Kuomintang's rule, every step forward is counted as a step forward, and there has never been a case of advancing and then retreating.

### Vast Territory, Weak Foundation

Critics Cannot Ignore

4. People who criticize China often ignore the vastness of China, the weakness of its political, economic, and social organization, and the complexity of its internal problems. Their observations and judgments are often dominated by the phenomena of a particular period, forgetting its background.

1927 to 1937 was the period when the power of the National Government was first tested. During this period, the government never had more than six months of peace. Let us briefly review the situation during these ten years. When the government was still in Guangzhou in 1926, it sent troops to conquer the northern warlords. After the National Government established its capital in Nanjing in 1927, the warlords were not yet eliminated, and the remnants of the old forces and the Communists were constantly conspiring to make trouble. In Chongqing, the wartime capital, open shops selling opium were all over the streets. Not only Chongqing, but also most other provinces and cities throughout the country were almost like this. Extraterritoriality for foreigners continued to exist. Major countries, even the United States, still held a cold and suspicious attitude towards the National Government. Since Japan openly invaded on September 18, 1931, the government had to resist the invasion while suppressing the Communist Party's armed rebellion in various parts of the south. However, in these ten years of internal and external attacks and numerous difficulties, the government was still able to carry out national construction work. By the time before the war, that is, in 1937, nearly 5,000 kilometers of new railways and nearly 100,000 kilometers of new highways had been built, and schools, parks, hospitals, and municipal central districts had been added in various places. The number of middle schools increased threefold, and the number of colleges and universities increased twofold. In 1936, the number of students in middle schools and vocational schools was nearly 600,000. The illiteracy rate was reduced by about 20 percent in ten years. The manufacturing of new-style arsenals also began in 1926. By the time of the Marco Polo Bridge Incident, China's arsenals were able to supply all the rifles, hand grenades, machine guns, mortars, and various accessories needed by the troops. The anti-drug movement was also widely launched during this period, and the number of drug offenders decreased rapidly. By the end of 1938, there were no open opium dens in the areas under the control of the Kuomintang government.

When the all-out war broke out in 1937, Japanese financial experts predicted that China's finances would collapse within a few months. The financial problems China encountered during the eight-year war of resistance were indeed difficult and complex. However, the government was able to survive the initial stage of the war (that is, the most dangerous stage of the war) without any serious financial crisis because it had taken a number of strong measures before the war, such as creating legal tender, concentrating cash reserves, and reforming the tax and banking systems.

In short, from the establishment of the National Government's capital in Nanjing in 1927 to the beginning of the Anti-Japanese War in 1937, this stage was a period when the Kuomintang suffered a serious test. During this period, although the government was constantly threatened and faced with difficulties both internally and externally, its goal was very simple, that is, to internally suppress the Communist Party, which was harming the country and the people, and to externally resist the aggression of Japanese imperialism. The will was unified, the strength was concentrated, and the relationship between China and its neighboring countries was not as complex as it is today. Therefore, it was ultimately able to make this period a period of construction. Industry and commerce developed, and the people in cities and villages were able to plan for their future and place their hopes. Industrial production in 1936 was higher than at any time before, and the general society felt prosperous.

### Closing Ceremony of the Youth League's Central Committee Held, Chairman Chiang Delivers Instructions in Person, Instructions on Working and Conducting Oneself

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 14th] The closing ceremony of the Second Plenary Session of the Youth League and the Joint Meeting of the Executive and Supervisory Committees was held at 9:00 a.m. on the 14th. Chairman Chiang presided over the ceremony in person and delivered a speech for about an hour. Chairman Chiang first said: Our party has a long history of revolution and excellent cadres, but in recent years it has been threatened by the Communist Party, which is very painful. When the Youth League was established, I had great hopes, but the League failed to make up for all the shortcomings within the party. Now, in order to unify the organization and concentrate forces, the party and the League must merge. Chairman Chiang then encouraged the attendees to act and conduct themselves properly, and said: In addition to the fundamental conflict of life with the Communist Party, our party should cooperate with other parties as much as possible, otherwise it will be the failure of our party. The principles of being a person should be based on respecting the old, loving the young, being pragmatic, self-denying, diligent, and thrifty, working together in harmony, and making joint efforts. After the merger of the party and the League, if there are any uncoordinated situations, the League should be responsible. Chairman Chiang continued to explain the issues after the merger of the party and the League, saying: If both sides still have doubts, it is unnecessary, and quoting the Bible as proof that "You will not grow unless you are buried," saying that if the seeds of the League are not buried in the party, they cannot undergo metabolism. The party needs the League's efforts to improve very much. Chairman Chiang also emphasized: (1) In the future, we must strengthen organization and training, and pay special attention to cadre training and self-training. (2) The principles of doing things should pay attention to the spirit and methods of science, and conduct practical research. (3) Cadres should lead by example in order to lead comrades. Finally, he said: In the past, our party comrades often made the mistake of failing to implement resolutions and plans, not checking the results, and not asking about the effects. In the future, we should pay attention to improvement.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 14th] President Chiang hosted a tea party at the Lixingshe Club on the afternoon of the 14th to entertain the executive and supervisory members, executive and supervisory officers, and attendees from various places of the party and the League, totaling more than 400 people.

### Eliminating Communist Armed Forces, Maintaining Peace in the Far East, Inflation Must Be Controlled

The various problems the government is encountering today are more complex than before the War of Resistance, but their sinister and difficult situation is similar to the period from 1937 to 1942 when China was forced to resist Japan alone. Whether the current government led by the Kuomintang can still overcome various new dangers and difficulties as it did before and during the war remains to be seen.

However, it is very clear that the Kuomintang and the current government's determination to overcome this new crisis has not weakened. As for the policies prepared to deal with this crisis, here is a brief description of what the government is paying special attention to: First, the armed forces of the Communist Party must be eliminated. The government's decision and its success or failure are not only related to the fate of the government itself, but also to whether China can achieve peace and security in the entire Far East. Therefore, the government is unwilling to consider any incomplete solution. Second, inflation must be controlled. Even if effective control methods need to be implemented step by step, the start of implementation should not be delayed any longer, as this is the root of various political, economic, and social pathologies. Third, in the provinces not harmed by the Communist Party, the government should do its best to accelerate economic recovery, and local governments will also implement necessary reforms at the same time. Finally, the government will move towards the goal of establishing constitutional governance with unyielding spirit. No matter what difficulties the Communist rebellion and other political factors can create for the achievement of this goal, the government is still prepared to implement the law passed last year. An ideal democratic constitutional government cannot be created overnight, but the general opinion within the government is that the best policy to achieve this goal is to start constitutional governance as soon as possible.

### Lei Zhen Discusses My Stance on the Peace Conference: Efforts Should Be Made to Urge the Soviet Union to Participate So That the Purpose of the Peace Conference Can Be Realized.

[Central News Agency, this city dispatch] Political Affairs Committee Member and Director of the Asia-East Association, Mr. Lei Zhen, spoke with reporters yesterday regarding the Japanese peace treaty. He believes that the procedures and content of the peace conference should be decided upon by the Four Powers Conference first, and then submitted to the Eleven-Nation Conference of the Far Eastern Commission for discussion. Regarding the peace conference, Mr. Lei stated that our country should make every effort to urge the Soviet Union to participate. If the Soviet Union refuses to participate, our country will also find it difficult to attend. If the Soviet Union does not participate in the peace conference, issues such as the Northeast problem and the Korean problem will be difficult to resolve, and the purpose of the peace conference will not be realized.

[This newspaper dispatch] Sources in diplomatic circles reveal that our country has requested the Far Eastern Commission that, in the total amount of reparations from Japan in the future, our country should receive 40 percent. However, this has not yet been approved. The United States, in principle, agrees that our country should receive more reparations, but hopes to slightly reduce the percentage. The United Kingdom has expressed opposition, because if this request is approved, the British Empire has many autonomous territories, and the percentage received by each unit will be very small. The Soviet Union also does not express agreement, the key being the issue of overseas assets. China, the United Kingdom, and the United States all advocate that the assets of Japan's overseas territories and investments in occupied areas should be listed as reparations, while the Soviet Union insists that such materials should be interpreted as war booty and obtained by the occupying forces. This dispute has not yet been resolved.

### Eastern Hubei Continuously Captures Luotian and Qishui; Chinese Troops in Anhui Continue to Advance, Surrounding Shucheng; One Brigade of Bandits Annihilated Between Lihuang and Shangcheng

[This newspaper dispatch, Xuzhou, 14th dispatch] The National Army in eastern Hubei is advancing like splitting bamboo. On the afternoon of the 13th, they captured the county seats of Luotian and Qishui in succession. The remnants of the 26th Column of bandits fled eastward, and the National Army on both the north and south routes are pursuing and annihilating them, and also encircling Yingshan.

[This newspaper dispatch, Bengbu, 14th dispatch] The war in central Anhui is intensifying. Zhao Fujian, the puppet county magistrate of Shucheng, has not dared to convene meetings of the people due to aerial reconnaissance and bombing. Powerful units of the Shangcheng-Hefei National Army are advancing towards Lihuang and Shucheng, holding a dominant position on the Shu-He highway. Shucheng has fallen into a major encirclement.

[This newspaper dispatch, Hefei, 14th dispatch] On the 13th, the bandit army in Lihuang launched a counterattack towards Shangcheng, engaging in fierce battles with the National Army in the Suxianshi, Xindianzi, and Yuzidian triangle area. The main force of the bandit army's Second Column, the Fifth Brigade, was completely annihilated, and another brigade suffered more than half casualties. Abandoned heavy and light machine guns, rifles, and ammunition were scattered everywhere.

[Another dispatch] South and southwest of Hefei's outer suburbs, since the bandit army was defeated at Taoxi Town on the 13th, there has been no change in the situation today. Order within Hefei city is still stable, but fuel prices have skyrocketed, with firewood selling for 80,000 yuan per load. The price of cigarettes has increased the most. The bandits in Lu'an are the 19th, 20th, 25th, and 27th Regiments of Liu Bocheng's Third Column, while those entrenched in Shucheng are the 23rd Regiment of the Third Column, all of whom are trapped. The movements of over 10,000 bandits who fled to various places in Lujiang and Tongcheng are still unclear. It is reported that 70,000 to 80,000 bandits who fled to western and central Anhui have been battered by the National Army on all sides in the past ten days and are now in a difficult situation. According to a military official here, the bandits have three options for finding a way out: crossing the Yangtze River, fleeing to northern Jiangsu, or entrenching themselves in the Dabie Mountains. However, the current situation makes all of these impossible.

[Another dispatch] Sixty bandits captured from Taoxi Town are in a wretched state like beggars, all of whom are strong young men in their twenties who were coerced from Shandong, Henan and Hebei. They expressed that they were unwilling to fight and would scatter like birds and beasts upon encountering the National Army's fierce artillery fire. Furthermore, the bandit army's designations are kept extremely secret, with soldiers only knowing the faces of their company and platoon leaders but not their names.

[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 14th dispatch] Within the 6th Column of bandits who fled to Yingshan, there are over 500 Sha people, all equipped with Japanese weapons.

[Central News Agency, Zhengzhou, 14th dispatch] Over 2,000 bandits raided Qianshan on the 12th, and the situation there remains unclear as of late this evening.

### Major Victory on the Northern Section of the Ping-Han Railway: Doudian Recaptured, Fangshan Also Relieved; Total Retreat of Communist Bandits, Casualties Reaching Over 10,000

[This newspaper dispatch, Beiping, 14th dispatch] The Communist bandits' offensive on the northern section of the Ping-Han Railway has suffered a major setback. Last night, there were fierce battles in Fangshan, Zhoukoudian, Liulihe, and Baodian. The Saidian station was temporarily evacuated. This morning, the National Army launched a counteroffensive from Zhuoxian and Changxindian simultaneously. The Communist bandits were unable to withstand it and retreated in disarray. Saidian was recaptured, and Fangshan was relieved. In the afternoon, there was still fighting south of Liulihe. The National Army intercepted the retreating Communist bandits at Yongle. The southward army had reached Liulihe by the afternoon.

[This newspaper dispatch, Beiping, 14th dispatch] A concerned general told reporters today with an excited tone: "The Communist bandits suffered heavy losses in this operation in the Pingjinbao triangle area, and the National Army achieved unprecedented results. The Communist bandits secretly crossed the Daqing River on the 6th of this month, and launched a fierce attack on Xiongxian and Ba counties on the 9th, deploying a force of 26 regiments, totaling over 45,000 men. The intensity of the fighting was unprecedented in Hebei Province. In Jiugang Town alone, the two armies fought over dozens of times, with countless casualties. Although Xiongxian was lost, by the 12th, the National Army's reinforcements had completed their deployment, and the counteroffensive began on the morning of the 13th. After only three hours of fierce fighting, the Communist bandits began a general retreat. The National Army took advantage of the situation to pursue, with land and air coordination, annihilating a large number of Communist bandits. Combining the results of the four days and nights of fighting, the Communist bandits' casualties have reached 15,000, and their brigade commander Sheng Zhihua and 55 regimental commanders were killed.

### State-Owned Transportation Enterprises Still Difficult to Be Self-Sufficient, Ministry of Communications Believes Continued Subsidies Are Necessary

[This newspaper dispatch, Nanjing, 14th dispatch] The Executive Yuan previously ordered the Ministry of Communications and relevant ministries to cancel subsidies for state-owned enterprises starting in October, hoping that they could seek self-sufficiency. After receiving the order, the Ministry of Communications convened relevant parties for consultations. They generally believed that increasing revenue, reducing expenditure, and reducing staff within their own scope were urgent matters. However, under the current circumstances, subsidies seemed necessary to continue. Taking the postal service as an example, according to current market prices, a plain letter needs to cost 2,500 yuan to maintain costs. However, if the price is quadrupled, the number of letter senders will inevitably decrease, and the goal of self-sufficiency cannot be achieved. The postal service still hopes for subsidies. The post office also plans to reduce staff and wages, and adopt a zone-based pricing method to reduce the burden on the people. In terms of telecommunications, ordinary commercial telegrams need to be doubled, i.e., increased from 1,000 yuan per word to 2,000 yuan to maintain operations. Railways, except for the Jinghu Railway, are losing heavily. If they are to be self-sufficient, passenger and freight rates need to be increased by more than three times. As for highways, none of the lines across the country can maintain the current state. Self-sufficiency is almost impossible, and continued subsidies are necessary.

### Qingdao American Military Pilot's Forced Landing in Bandit Area and Dangerous Experience: The United States Exchanged Some Materials to Get Him Back

[This newspaper dispatch, Qingdao, 13th dispatch] U.S. Marine Corps Captain Winters, who was piloting a plane, was forced to land on the sea off the Shandong Peninsula because he ran out of gasoline and returned to Qingdao on the 11th after staying in the bandit area for two weeks. According to his account: On the 27th, while practicing flying, he made a forced landing on the coast about 130 kilometers northeast of Qingdao. The place is now known to be Rushankou east of Haiyang County. He was immediately detained by the local guerrillas and sent to live in Xiacun, about five kilometers from the coast. He was not mistreated. He was then sent to Wendeng. The person he contacted daily was a Communist Party member who could speak English, claiming to be Lieutenant Colonel Wang, who gave him political propaganda talks. Winters relied entirely on walking on foot in the Communist area, covering hundreds of li. According to reporters, the Communist side had asked the U.S. military liaison officer for US$80,000 in exchange for Winters, but the result was likely unsuccessful. The U.S. military authorities did not deny that some materials were given to the Communist side. In the Communist area, Winters was surrounded by curious people who were very interested in his thick golden hair.

(II) Education System: An excellent military officer training system is fundamental to building a strong army. Since its establishment, the Ministry of National Defense has paid special attention to improving the education system. The formulated education system and key implementation points are described as follows: 1. The principles for establishing a military officer education system are to enhance officers' scientific literacy and cultivate unified commanders and staff officers for the army, navy, and air force. Other key considerations include strengthening joint logistics training, specialized technical training, and cultivating reserve officers. 2. The levels of military officer education are divided into four categories: basic officer education, advanced education, specialized staff education, and higher national defense education. One, the basic officer education level includes the establishment of a unified army, navy, and air force joint training military academy, the establishment of an officer training center, and the creation of reserve officer training groups to cultivate basic cadres for the national defense forces. Two, advanced education is provided by branch schools established by each service. Three, advanced staff officer education is provided by the Staff College, which is under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of National Defense. Four, higher national defense education is provided by the National Defense University, which trains outstanding military officers and civilians to become senior military talents and national defense economic and technical experts, under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of National Defense. In addition, special schools are established as needed to provide specialized training, and a Military Science Research Institute is established, hiring scientific experts to conduct research. 3. Regarding the implementation: The Military Academy and Officer Training Corps are currently being prepared for establishment. Primary classes of the Army Combined Arms Schools will be established this autumn (the 36th year of the Republic), and advanced classes are scheduled to be established next year (the 37th year of the Republic). Naval and Air Force schools are also under preparation. Planning for the Staff College has begun, and it is expected to be established this winter (the 36th year of the Republic). The National Defense University is scheduled to be established in the 39th year of the Republic. The Military Science Academy has been discussed with the Ministry of Education, and the Ministry has entrusted various ordinary universities to handle it first.

(III) Supply System: The quality of the supply system directly affects the well-being of officers and soldiers and is indirectly related to the combat effectiveness of the front lines. It is also an important part of the military system. The Ministry of National Defense has carefully designed it to establish a good supply system, as described below: One, separate finance and management. In the past, financial and material matters were managed by quartermaster personnel. Now, following the spirit of establishing laws and regulations, finance and management are separated into two systems, with clear divisions of personnel and institutions, each responsible for their own duties. Two, separate budget and finance. Following the principle of separating budget and accounting responsibilities, the Ministry and all subordinate agencies and units have separate budget personnel to handle budget preparation, review, allocation, supervision, pre-expenditure verification and certification, and periodic post-expenditure reporting, so that the Ministry can fully control the budget. Accounting revenue and expenditure matters are managed by the finance department, and independent military expenditure is implemented, so that business units do not handle cash receipts and disbursements, and the public treasury system is strictly enforced to bring the accounting system into order. Three, promote in-kind supply. This system has been implemented for a long time, and efforts are still being made to thoroughly improve it. Military equipment, food, clothing, equipment, fuel, etc., are all supplied in-kind to avoid entrusting units, causing inconvenience, or creating corruption. Its implementation is based on the principle of the supervisor implementing the supply according to the prescribed plan without waiting for requests from all parties. Four, strive to verify the number of soldiers. The deep-rooted problem of ghost soldiers has been corrected repeatedly, but it is still difficult to eliminate. In order to completely correct this problem, the Ministry of National Defense has recently developed a daily personnel report form. In the future, all allowances and supplies will be based on the figures in the daily report form. If it can be implemented smoothly, the problem of ghost soldiers can be eradicated. At the same time, a method of personnel and horse verification is being drafted and implemented to complement the reporting method.

D. General Overview of Bandit Suppression

(I) General Situation of the Communist Bandits: The Communist bandits' conspiracy to subvert the government and divide the country has aroused public indignation and needs no further explanation. During the War of Resistance, they specialized in attacking friendly forces. After Japan's surrender, they relied on foreign aid to obtain Japanese equipment and coerced the people into becoming bandits. Their current situation is as follows: Total force of approximately 860,150 people, with 613,150 in field units and 247,000 in military region units. Approximately 444,000 are located outside the passes, and approximately 416,150 are located inside the passes.

(II) General Situation of Operations in the Past Six Months: Since the Third Plenary Session, the Ministry of National Defense has continued to suppress the bandits under political guidance. In the past six months, our loyal and brave officers and soldiers have fought bravely, first occupying the bandit's Yan'an, and then suppressing the bandit's stubborn resistance in the Yimeng Mountain area, capturing their base areas. They have also launched strong attacks on the bandit army in the Northeast, which colludes with Korean and Mongolian Communist bandits and uses Japanese surrendered soldiers, repelled multiple invasions by bandits in Shanxi, and are now preparing to counterattack the bandits who have crossed the Luo River. The bandit forces of Liu Bocheng in northern Henan have been attacked multiple times, and their main force has been cut off from their retreat north, so they have fled to the vicinity of the Dabie Mountains and are being encircled and annihilated. Since the government issued the general mobilization order and improved allowances, morale has been revived, and officers and soldiers are deeply grateful. The general situation of operations in the past six months is described as follows: One, Northeast: The bandits crossed the Songhua River and invaded five times. In late February, the bandits invaded Changchun in three routes. After being repelled by our forces, in late May, the bandits launched a large-scale operation to attack Sipingjie. The bandits, colluding with Korean and Mongolian Communist bandits and Japanese prisoners of war, numbered approximately 200,000 and attacked in five routes. The defending troops of Chen Mingren, who bravely defended Sipingjie, cooperated with north and south pincers after defending for 19 days, and met at Sipingjie on June 20, annihilating approximately 150,000 bandits. We have now adjusted our troops, reorganized our posture, completed all preparations, and formulated a resolution to annihilate the bandits again. Two, Northern Hebei: In the past six months, there have been two major operations in northern Hebei. In April, the bandit Nie Rongzhen attacked Shijiazhuang without success, and then used his main force to attack Niangziguan along the Zhengtai Road, attempting to join forces with the Shanxi bandits Chen Geng and He Long to attack Taiyuan. We annihilated more than 10,000 of them between Chouyang and Yuci. The bandit Nie still fled back to central Hebei. In late June, the Hebei bandits attacked Baoding again. In early July, our reinforcements lifted the siege of Baoding and took advantage of the victory to recover nine counties, including Zhengding and Wangdu. The bandits fled to the Fuping Mountain area. Three, Northern Shaanxi: In mid-March, the National Army advanced from Luochuan and Yichuan to suppress the bandits in Yan'an. On the 19th, Yan'an was recovered. Most of the bandits fled to Shanxi, and a portion fled to the Gansu border. In early May, in the Battle of Heshui, the bandits on the Gansu border were defeated. The remnants fled back to Huanxian. In early August, the bandits attacked Yulin. After fierce fighting by our defending troops and the northbound reinforcements, the bandits suffered 30,000 casualties by the 20th, and the remnants were scattered and are being mopped up. Four, Northern Henan: The bandits in northern Henan launched three operations in the past six months. First, in mid-March, they attacked Xinxiang and Jixian. After suffering losses, they fell into Tangyin and Anchang. After defending for two months, they were repelled. Secondly, in June, Liu Bocheng launched the western Shandong operation, attempting to assist the bandit Chen Yi in central Shandong. We defended Heze and Quanxiang, cut off the bandit Liu Bocheng's retreat, and launched a counterattack. A portion of the bandits fled to the border between Henan and Anhui. The Shanxi bandit Chen Geng attacked western Henan to support Liu Bocheng. We are currently blocking them in the vicinity of Luoning. Five, Shandong: In the past six months, there have been multiple operations in Shandong, and the results achieved have been the greatest, including the suppression of the bandits in the Yimeng Mountain area, the opening of the Jiaoji Railway, and the dismemberment of the bandit Chen Yi's forces. The main points are described as follows: One, Linqu Operation. In early February, our north and south army groups advanced to suppress the bandits in southern Shandong. On February 15, Linqu was recovered. Because the northern army group was defeated at Laiwu Tusi Pass, the deployment was readjusted. Two, Operation in the Yimeng Mountain Area. In April, our southern army group continued to advance to suppress the bandits in the Yimeng Mountain area, first occupying Xintai and Laiwu. In mid-July, their main force was defeated in Nanma and Linqu, annihilating more than 50,000 bandits. It is reported that approximately 20,000 bandits remain after the encirclement and annihilation of those who fled to western Shandong. The Jiaoji Railway was also completely recovered on August 24. Except for a portion of the bandit army in Jiaodong, the entire territory of Shandong is now under our control. Those in the Rizhao coastal area are currently being encircled and annihilated.

Editorial

### Put Yourself in China's Shoes and Think!

After General Wedemeyer left China, he sorted out the data in Honolulu and will report the results of this trip to the US President. In order for the US Special Envoy to easily understand the actual situation in China, the Chinese government presented a memorandum to the Special Envoy before he left China. Director Dong of the News Bureau, Xian Guang, came to Shanghai from Beijing yesterday to publish this memorandum from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to the press.

In this memorandum, the Chinese government frankly pointed out the various difficulties encountered after the war, and frankly admitted the difficulty of national construction and reconstruction after the war, but also expressed the government's unwavering determination to revive and build the country.

We want our American friends to put themselves in China's shoes and think. China is an agricultural country, and a backward agricultural country. During the War of Resistance, the agricultural areas with the richest production were all occupied by the Japanese army, and suffered the enemy's destruction and damage. For eight years, China's agricultural economy has been on the verge of bankruptcy. Whether it is manpower, livestock, or fertilizer, there is a shortage. The improvement of agricultural production methods is even more out of the question. Therefore, after the victory, even if there was no Communist Party problem that deepened the decline of the rural economy, China's agricultural production could not be restored for a while. The severity of China's food problem after the war is by no means accidental. What's more, after the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, before we had a chance to catch our breath, the Communist Party problem arose. In addition to possessing more than 300,000 regular troops, the Communist bandits also have many so-called "people's armies." They not only rebelled and attempted to expand their territory, but also had their followers disrupt and destroy in various parts of the country, so that the people could not live and work in peace, in an attempt to seize power. The Communist bandits knew that transportation was the lifeline of the country, so they destroyed railway transportation in various places. Ninety percent of the country's railways were at a standstill. Inland river shipping was also unable to run smoothly due to the lack of transport ships and local unrest. The Communist bandits also knew that mineral products and rural areas were the country's only resources, so they did their best to disrupt and destroy them in various places, so that mineral products could not be mined and farmers could not cultivate the land with peace of mind. Under such circumstances, how could China not feel the panic of material shortage?

In terms of China's current national economy, the biggest difficulty is the endless currency inflation. The creation of this phenomenon cannot but be said to be the result of the eight-year War of Resistance and the two-year civil war. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, China fought alone, without foreign aid. Economically, it had to rely entirely on issuing banknotes to maintain itself. During these eight years, other expenses aside, the military expenditure alone was really considerable. In order to implement the national policy of resisting Japan, China caused currency inflation. Although the lives of the people across the country were directly threatened, they had no complaints. After the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the government could have started to reorganize or reform the currency system to stabilize the domestic financial situation. Unexpectedly, the Communist Party deliberately created a two-year civil war. Because of the existence of the Communist bandits, the troop reorganization plan could not be implemented, so the austerity policy was just empty talk, and the continued inflation of the currency caused the current situation. On the surface, the government seems to be fully responsible for the creation of the current situation; but in reality, it should be blamed on the Japanese invaders and the Communist bandits. Now that the Japanese invaders have been defeated, they should compensate China for its losses; but the peace conference with Japan is far away, and the compensation problem cannot be solved for a while, so we cannot get compensation. At the same time, the Communist bandit problem cannot be solved in the short term because of the previous "peace talks." Therefore, those who do not know the truth inevitably express pessimistic views on China's economic future.

The United States is located in the Western Hemisphere. Although it once participated in the war and sacrificed a lot of manpower and material resources, its country did not directly suffer the catastrophe of war. Therefore, after the war, it is still a paradise on earth. "The well-fed do not know the hunger of the starving." Anyone who cannot put themselves in China's shoes and think will not deeply appreciate the difficulties and pain that China has suffered. We do not want to say more, nor do we want to have the mentality of relying solely on foreign aid, but we still believe that China and the United States have a long history of good relations, and the United States has a moral responsibility for the creation of peace in the Far East. Therefore, we hope that the United States, after reading our memorandum, can put themselves in China's shoes and think: Is China's difficulty something that a war-weary country can easily overcome?

### The Kuomintang's New Life Exam

The Fourth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang and the Joint Meeting of the Central Party and the Party Group closed on the 13th. From now on, members of the Three People's Principles Youth League will jointly devote themselves to the work of revolutionary construction in the name of Kuomintang members. The Kuomintang President has already instructed the tasks and reform points of the Kuomintang in the conference. Central Committee Member Song Ziwen and others suggested organizing a Comrades Mutual Aid Association to raise funds to donate to the families of party members who died for the War of Resistance Against Japan and the suppression of bandits. Mr. Song took the lead in donating private property, donating all his shares in the China Construction Bank Company for this fund. This cannot but be regarded as a symbol of the Kuomintang's new life. The conference declaration said: "We are willing to promote the new life of the party with the unity and struggle of the party, to create the driving force of the revolution with the new life of the party, and to achieve a comprehensive reform of politics and economy with the driving force of the revolution." We are extremely looking forward to these beautiful words, starting from Mr. Zhu's wise move of donating private property, all Kuomintang members can truly "answer expectations with facts and prove determination with actions." For the sake of China's future, we are very much looking forward to the Kuomintang's new life.

The Kuomintang's leaders made a realistic and frank self-examination in the joint meeting of the party and the group, explaining where the party's success was in the past, and where its failure was. When it came to the most painful part, they felt deeply ashamed of Mr. Sun Yat-sen, the Premier. Some foreign reporters heard the word "failure" and spread it in surprise, thinking that no politicians in the world had ever publicly admitted "failure" like the Kuomintang President this time. In fact, this is precisely the traditional virtue of the Chinese teaching "blaming oneself and lightly blaming others," and it is also the spiritual foundation for the Kuomintang to overcome every obstacle. Moreover, there is a Western proverb that "failure is the mother of success," so even if there is failure, it is not enough to worry about. What's more, today the Kuomintang members are united and invigorated. During the national suppression of bandits and rebellion, if they can always be the vanguard of the people, then the Kuomintang's new life will be 100% guaranteed. What "failure" is there?

Today's situation in China is indeed very difficult. All reforms seem to be urgent, and in fact, the key to turning danger into safety and turning chaos into order lies only in a thought in the minds of the people across the country. The so-called "Han Nian" means "publicly hating selfishness and forgetting the family for the sake of the country." To make such a big shift in the psychology of the people across the country, the government must first have this ambition. The Kuomintang is still the largest party in power today. Therefore, only the self-denial and dedication of the Kuomintang members can promote the new life of the Kuomintang, and the new life of the Kuomintang is in fact the cornerstone of the new life of the whole of China. The fate of the Kuomintang and the fate of China are already inseparable. Very simply, we would like to first take this matter—whether all Kuomintang members with financial resources can follow Mr. Zhu Ziwen and donate all or part of their private property to repay the party and the country—as an exam to see whether the Kuomintang can thoroughly start a new life.

[United Press New York, 14th] US Secretary of State Marshall delivered an important speech tonight at the American United Nations Association, clarifying the US's overall policy toward the upcoming UN General Assembly on the 16th, reiterating the US's determination to support UN organizations, urging the General Assembly to take immediate action to remove the direct threat to Greek independence from the Soviet Balkan satellite states, and to conclude peace treaties with Japan, Germany, Austria and other countries as soon as possible. It is said that the aid of the three countries of Southern Bao'a to the Greek guerrillas directly threatens the territorial integrity and political independence of that country, and we express our deep concern, and will work with other member states to resist such aggression. The United States has no other intention than to pacify the Balkan riots, and hopes that the General Assembly can find a way to achieve this goal. The United States will support the United Nations in two ways: (1) to strive to complete the peace treaties of other countries and restore the normal environment in which UN organizations can perform their duties. Another (1) is to cooperate with various countries to promote the world's economic situation and achieve the economic conditions necessary for international stability. However, it is a serious mistake to say that every international issue should be handled by UN organizations. (Note that this statement may refer to its European Recovery Program, which the Soviet Union has previously criticized for disregarding UN organizations). The US delegation will propose many items at the General Assembly, hoping to help solve some of the issues that are currently disrupting normal international relations, among which we pay special attention to the Greek and Palestinian issues. However, when UN organizations find ways to overcome various obstacles to reaching agreements on common issues, they have not exhausted their potential in the Charter. The United States does not believe that the veto provisions of the UN Charter need to be significantly revised. In addition, the United States hopes to admit various countries that have reached the time for membership as soon as possible to join the UN organizations.

### The Current UN General Assembly is Closely Related to the Far East, and the US May Raise Issues Such as Korea for Discussion

[United Press Washington, 14th] Diplomatic sources here predict that the current UN General Assembly will be more important to the people of the Far East than last year's General Assembly. Important topics currently on the agenda focus on European and Middle Eastern events, but according to the opinions of test diplomats, many believe that before the end of the General Assembly, several matters closely related to the Far East will be raised. These matters involve Korea, Vietnam, India, Indonesia, and may even include Japan.

[Central News Agency New York, 13th] According to authoritative sources today, the United States is very likely to suggest that the Korean issue be submitted to the upcoming United Nations General Assembly for discussion. According to people close to the US delegation who told Central News Agency reporters this morning, we can say that the Jiang delegation is currently considering whether it is possible to first propose to include the Korean issue on the agenda of matters that have already been fully submitted for discussion.

### Strict Security at the UN General Assembly Venue

[United Press Flushing, New York, 14th] Due to the recent three demonstrations that shocked the Security Council, the United Nations hired special guards on the 14th and summoned the New York City Police to provide strict protection for the United Nations General Assembly. The US Federal Bureau of Investigation and the secret agents of the British Police General Alliance will closely protect the representatives of various countries. Among them, at least ten delegations, including the five Arab delegations, will reportedly dispatch special guards to protect them. The representatives of the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and Saudi Arabia will bring their own guards.

### Lai Speaks and Reviews the World Situation

[United Press Baltimore, 14th] United Nations Secretary-General Lai Yi delivered a speech at the Maryland United Nations Association banquet today, entitled "A Personal Review of the World Situation." It is said that the liberation movement of various nations in the former colonies may pose a greater threat to world peace than disputes between major countries. The failure to conclude peace treaties on weekdays has hindered the work of UN organizations and delayed the world's economic recovery. Major countries are significantly closer to each other than in 1920 to 1930. Some issues are being replaced by the national liberation movements of former colonies, which may cause major conflicts. So far, purely military disputes have been rare, at least not in the form of open warfare. He hopes that the next meeting of foreign ministers will make positive progress on the peace treaty. The so-called failure of UN organizations is not so much a failure of UN organizations themselves as it is a failure of countries to live in harmony. If you carefully analyze the situation, you will find that every negotiation and every meeting has made some progress in mutual understanding between countries.

### Representatives from Various Countries Gather in New York

[United Press Lake Success, 13th] According to estimates by the United Nations Headquarters, nearly a thousand representatives from various countries attending the second UN General Assembly have arrived here, and it is expected that another 1,800 representatives and consultants will arrive here before the 16th. French Prime Minister Lai Madi will arrive within 48 hours, and Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky will arrive after the 16th.

### The French-Occupied Zone of Germany Must Be Merged with the British and American Zones

[Reuters Paris, 13th] "The World Daily," which reflects the views of the French Foreign Ministry, stated today that the merger of the French military zone in Germany with the British and American zones is inevitable, so it is very likely that Germany will be divided into two major zones, east and west. However, France will not decide the future of the French military zone in Germany before the four-power foreign ministers' meeting is held in London in November. "The World Daily" pointed out that the French military zone has a population of 6 million, while the British and American zones have a population of 40 million, so the French military zone cannot be separated from the British and American zones.

### The Soviet Union Celebrates Tank Day

[United Press London, 13th] Moscow Radio broadcast that today is Tank Day, and Soviet Defense Minister Bulganin ordered the capitals of the Soviet republics to fire 20 artillery salvos on the 14th to celebrate. Mr. Bulganin also called on workers in tank factories to concentrate their efforts and awareness to gloriously complete the work assigned by Comrade Stalin in order to enhance the strength of the armed mechanized army.

### The British Military Delegation to Hungary is Scheduled to End Today

### American Aid to Europe Unlikely to be Advanced; Hope for Special Congressional Session Dwindles

[Reuters, Washington, 14th] Hopes for an early special session of the U.S. Congress to vote on an emergency interim aid package for Europe suddenly dwindled today. Three developments indicate that Secretary of State Marshall and his experts' plans for early aid to Europe do not have the full support of Congress or other parts of the Cabinet:

(1) Accompanying reporters on President Truman's flagship, the USS "Missouri," returning from South America, all stated that the President had not changed his opinion expressed at a press conference before his trip to Brazil, namely that "there is currently no sufficient reason to convene members of the Senate and House of Representatives from their recess to return to Washington;" (2) A responsible source close to Senator Vandenberg, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, also stated that Vandenberg was very pessimistic about the possibility of convening a special session of Congress; (3) Several respected members of Congress agreed with President Truman's assertion that there was no need to convene a special session of Congress. Senator Millikin of Colorado, a Republican financial authority, declined to express support for the idea of ​​calling a special session. Senate Republican Leader Lucas and several other Democratic senators also expressed similar views. The high hopes of European countries' diplomatic representatives in the U.S., after hearing Marshall strongly advocate for early aid due to the grave and urgent situation in Europe last week, have plummeted due to the clear conclusions drawn from the aforementioned reports.

[United Press, Washington, 13th] It was learned today that government officials will await President Truman's return to Washington on the 20th before detailing the facts to explain the extent of the European economic crisis, so that the President can consider whether the situation is serious and promptly decide within a few days whether there is reason to convene a special session of Congress.

### France and Italy Form Joint Committee to Discuss Customs Union

[Reuters, Paris, 13th] France and Italy signed a declaration at the French Foreign Ministry today expressing their willingness to begin studying the possibility of establishing a Franco-Italian customs union. The two sides have appointed a joint committee to conduct the study and submit a report to their respective governments before the end of the year. The declaration was signed by French Foreign Minister Bidault and the head of the Italian delegation to the European Economic Conference, Campilli, on behalf of their respective governments. The joint committee will also study the possibility of France and Italy joining a European customs union.

### U.S. Considers Making All Military Forces Available for Dispatch by UN Agencies in Effort to Restore the Agency's Reputation

[Reuters, New York, 14th] It is reported that the United States is considering making its entire army, navy, and air force available for dispatch by UN agencies to restore peace and security in troubled areas around the world, including Greece, Palestine, and Indonesia. This plan is part of the overall strategy of the U.S. delegation at the current UN General Assembly. Secretary of State Marshall briefly explained this plan to the Cabinet and the U.S. delegation to the UN General Assembly in Washington today. Observers believe that the reputation of the UN agency depends on this General Assembly session. The startling nature of this U.S. military plan clearly indicates that the United States is prepared to use its full force to restore the reputation of the UN agency, if necessary, at the cost of the lives of the American people to restore the reputation and position of the UN agency.

### U.S. Establishes Radar Station in Greenland; Danish Government Confirms

[United Press, Copenhagen, 13th] Official confirmation has been obtained today regarding the establishment of a test station of unknown purpose by the U.S. military within Danish territory. According to Greenland Affairs Minister Oldenburg, he told reporters that he had received reports similar to those in the communist newspapers stating that the United States had established a radar station in Greenland in an attempt to bolster U.S. air defenses. To date, the U.S. side has not notified the Danish government of its activities, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will investigate whether this action violates the 1941 Danish agreement.

### South Slavs Detain British and American Soldiers; Britain and the U.S. Lodging Strong Protests

[Reuters, London, 13th] A British Foreign Office spokesman stated: The British Ambassador to Yugoslavia, Peake, has lodged a note with the Yugoslav government strongly protesting the illegal detention and mistreatment of active British and American military personnel by the South Slav authorities on the Italo-Yugoslav border. The United States also lodged a strong protest with the South Slav Foreign Ministry on Thursday night regarding the same incident.

### Italian Left-Wing Parties Encourage General Strike

[United Press, Rome, 13th] Italian labor leaders have ordered 850,000 metalworkers to strike starting on the 15th, as part of a movement to force the Gasperi government to resign. If the strike is implemented, it will paralyze the heavy industries of Milan, Turin, and Terni. Over one million farmers and 200,000 other workers are also on strike. The strike echoes the communist parties' second motion of no confidence in the current government, submitted to the National Assembly within three days.

### Anglo-American Involvement in Iranian Oil Dispute; Iran in Extremely Difficult Position; Iran May Ultimately Be Forced to Make Concessions to the Soviets

[Reuters, Tehran, 14th] Iranian Prime Minister Sultanah declared: The rumors that the British Ambassador to Iran, Sir Reader Bullard, advised the Iranian government to keep the door open for negotiations even if the Iranian Parliament rejected the Soviet-Iranian oil agreement are completely unfounded. Sultanah said that Ambassador Bullard had strongly stated that Britain firmly opposes interference in Iranian affairs, especially regarding oil rights.

[Reuters, London, 13th] A British Foreign Office spokesman stated: Britain and the United States share the same basic objective in Iran, namely to maintain the country's territorial integrity. The methods of British and American policy may differ, but the goal is the same. The spokesman also denied reports that the United States had protested to Britain about British Ambassador Bullard's advice to the Iranian government to keep the door open for negotiations after the Iranian Parliament rejected the Soviet-Iranian oil agreement signed in April 1946. Dispatches from Washington stated that the United States hoped Iran could adopt a firmer policy and believed that the British ambassador's advice to the Iranian government was out of fear that the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company's oil rights in Iran would also be revoked if the Soviet-Iranian oil agreement was rejected.

[United Press, London, 13th] Diplomatic observers say Iran will sooner or later make concessions to the Soviet Union on oil and political issues. London believes that Iran's inability to permanently adopt an unfriendly attitude towards the Soviet Union is a foregone conclusion. Well-informed diplomatic sources say that if the Soviet Union cannot obtain economic concessions from Iran, it may take military and political steps, so Britain is prepared to consider economic concessions.

### American Church Leader Predicts Communist Party Will Fail

[United Press, Washington, 13th] Dr. Cadman, a leader of the American Council of Churches, stated in a formal report to Secretary of the Army Royall that he had the impression from his travels in Europe this summer that the Soviet Union's desire to gradually encompass Europe and the world would ultimately destroy the Communist Party. Cadman said: "Everyone is holding their breath waiting for the first shot in the final conflict between the communist aggressors and the democratic countries, and the U.S. military is no exception. The Soviet Union is currently obstructing the construction of Europe and creating chaos, hoping to create a 'revolutionary environment.' The oppressed people of Europe know that the Soviet Union is the root cause of their suffering and may rise up to overthrow the communists. Even if the people do not rise up and resist, God will avenge them." Royall had sent fourteen clergymen to Europe for observation, and this was the fourth report he received.

### Fire at Japanese Finance Ministry Destroys Important Documents

[United Press, Tokyo, 14th] A major fire broke out at the Ministry of Finance building last night, destroying the building and important documents such as the budget proposal, but there were no casualties. More than 30 fire trucks rushed to the scene to provide assistance, and Finance Minister Kurusu also personally visited the fire site. According to the police department, the fire may have been caused by excessive heat from an electric stove. "Tokyo Shimbun" quoted neighbors and junior officials of the Ministry of Finance as saying that officials often drank and made merry after meetings, and that this carelessness was self-inflicted.

### Doihara and Other War Criminals Refuse to Testify

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 13th] A person returning from the International War Crimes Tribunal told our reporter that Kenji Doihara, the famous Japanese spy (the "Lawrence of Manchuria"), and sixteen other Class A war criminals, are expected to refuse to testify, as they fear that their testimonies may be flawed under rigorous questioning.

### China Will Continue to Send Military and Political Officials to Assist Chiang Chia-tung's Investigation; The Netherlands is Willing to Provide Chiang with All Kinds of Convenience

[Reuters, Batavia, 13th] The Dutch Embassy in Nanjing announced today: The Dutch government has informed the Chinese government that it is willing to provide any convenience to Chiang Chia-tung, the Chinese Consul-General in Batavia, so that he can conduct investigations into the implementation of the ceasefire order as a member of the consular corps, in accordance with the resolution of the Security Council. China will continue to send military and political officials to assist Chiang's investigation.

[Central News Agency, Batavia, 13th] Our Consul-General Chiang Chia-tung and the Belgian Consul-General returned this morning from an aerial trip to Tjiseuk Maraja, about 100 kilometers southeast of Kolontong. It is said that the situation around the area is not peaceful. The Indonesian army burned two houses during the few hours they occupied the area. On their way back, they landed in Bandung and then took a car from there to Tjiwidej and Pengalengan, 40 kilometers south of Bandung.

### Japanese Parliament Reconvenes Today; Katayama Faces Difficulties; Opposition Party Attempts to Seize Power

[United Press, Tokyo, 14th] The Social Democratic Cabinet led by Katayama will face what Japanese politicians regard as the most serious test since its establishment when the Japanese Parliament reconvenes today. After the parliament reconvenes, there are still many unresolved and highly contentious issues on its agenda, giving the lone opposition party, the Liberal Party, an opportunity to overthrow the Katayama Cabinet. Yoshida, the president of the Liberal Party and former prime minister, recently said in a speech in Hokkaido that the current coalition cabinet is "a mixed family of monkeys in hats."

When Katayama and Nishio hosted domestic and foreign journalists yesterday, they strongly asserted that the current cabinet is fully qualified to represent Japan in the upcoming peace conference, and therefore there is no need for any cabinet changes. According to the English-language Japan Times' prediction on the 14th: "The Katayama Cabinet will encounter major difficulties during the upcoming parliamentary session due to strong opposition from non-government parties attempting to control important legislation." All of this legislation is focused on the Japanese economic reconstruction plan, including the nationalization of coal mines, budget subsidies, and the distribution of industrial and commercial enterprises to oppose monopolies. Of the current 466 members of the House of Representatives, the Social Democratic Party and the Democratic Party, which support the Katayama Cabinet, account for more than 270 seats, while the opposition Liberal Party accounts for 123 seats. It has recently been repeatedly rumored that Yoshida and others are attempting to form another powerful conservative opposition party in order to lay the foundation for overthrowing Katayama and reorganizing a powerful and unified cabinet that is more fully qualified to represent Japan at the peace conference.

### Minister Bai's Military Report at the Fourth Plenary Session; Hah Wen (Continued from above) (Second Edition)

(3) Operational achievements in the past six months: (A) Strategic achievements: (1) The bandits originally planned to copy the National Army's strategy of resisting Japan, attempting to win by exhaustion and attrition. The National Army had already seen through their plot. After repeated suppression campaigns, the bandits lost Yan'an and then Central Shandong in the past six months. Their occupied areas are shrinking daily, especially with the depletion of troops and the lack of resources. With the military setbacks, they are trapped in poor and crowded mountainous areas, and it is difficult for military production to supply the consumption of large armies. It is absolutely difficult to compensate for their long-term losses in manpower replenishment. The objective conditions for the so-called protracted war have been eliminated. (2) The bandits' base areas have been repeatedly destroyed, and most of their elite troops have been lost. The morale of the army is declining day by day. Chen Yi, the bandit leader, is known to be strong, and the soldiers of Qi and Lu are known to be brave. They had been operating in the Yimeng Mountain area for ten years, with deep roots. However, when the National Army launched a suppression campaign, they first occupied Linyi and repeatedly defeated Nanma and Linqu. Their base area was destroyed, and the number of people who surrendered and returned increased daily. The bandits have always regarded materialism as their doctrine, and their military thinking is also materialistic. Now, after being hit by this factual blow, the spiritual conditions for their protracted war have been lost. (3) The bandits' external sources have been cut off. Since the rapid recovery of the Central Plains Military Region, the bandits' supply has become increasingly difficult. They can only rely on the Liaodong Peninsula as the only supply route to the interior. Their military supplies often depend on this. Now that we have recovered Shandong and are advancing into Jiaodong, intending to cut off their external aid, the source of supply will be cut off, which is also a clear sign that the bandits' final doomsday is approaching. (4) Yan'an was the bandits' political center and the location for issuing orders. After the National Army recovered it, their leadership was lost, and morale was obviously shaken. (5) Ensuring the results of the victory in the War of Resistance. The purpose of our War of Resistance was entirely to recover sovereignty over the Northeast. The communist bandits colluded with foreign forces, originally attempting to take advantage of the War of Resistance to reap the benefits of others' labor. When the National Army took over, the bandits were very disappointed, so they did not hesitate to cross the river five times to invade, but they were all defeated by our army. The recent Battle of Siping was a particularly severe blow. Ensuring sovereignty over the Northeast is not only what the people of the whole country hope for, but also where the lifeline of the country lies. In the operations of the past six months, the bandits concentrated their forces and colluded with Korean and Mongolian bandits, but they were still helpless, which is also one of our strategic gains. (B) Cities and towns recovered, transportation lines, and the number of communist bandits captured, wounded, and killed: The above describes the bandits' strategic losses, which are also spiritual defects that cannot be compensated for. Now, the material losses are briefly listed as follows: (1) 117 cities and towns were recovered, covering an area of ​​approximately 228,778 square kilometers. (2) 950,893 bandits were killed or wounded, 92,336 were captured, and 52,504 bandits surrendered. (3) Major transportation lines recovered include the middle section of the Longhai Line, the Beining Line, the northern section of the Pinghan Line, the PingSui Line, the Jiaoji Line, the Zhongchang Line and its branches, and the Jinre Line. The communist bandits destroyed 3,164 kilometers, and 1,826 kilometers have now been repaired and opened to traffic. (4) The situation of the National Army's progress in suppressing the bandits in the past six months is compared as shown in the attached figure. (C) The above describes the losses of the bandit army. As for the casualties of the National Army in the past six months, they were 346,537, with greater losses in the Shandong battlefield.

E. Conclusion

The policy guidelines of this Ministry for the 36th year of the Republic were originally to continue the reorganization and demobilization of the army as the biggest goal, and they are being gradually implemented according to plan. Now the communist bandits are intensifying their military expansion and expanding the rebellion, and are even leading Korean and Mongolian communist bandits and Japanese prisoners of war into the Northeast, with weapons supplied by a certain party, to attack the National Army. They have also colluded with Outer Mongolia and blatantly encroached on the Western borders. Half of the country is being destroyed horizontally. Wherever the bandits go, they destroy factories, railways, river dikes, and mining areas, trying to completely destroy the country's vitality and the national economy. They slaughter the innocent and do everything to the extreme. All the cruel acts that foreign enemies cannot bear to do, the communists can do willingly and without scruples, causing the people to suffer deeply and the fate of the country to be shaken. The government, with its responsibilities, had no choice but to resolve to quell the chaos and remove the obstacles to national construction in order to protect the country's foundation and the people's lives. As long as the communist bandits exist for one day, the country's peace, social order, and people's lives will be harmed for one day, and the country's finances and the national economy will be destroyed. National construction and army building cannot be started. Looking at the overall situation of the world, the conflicts between countries due to boundary concepts, economic interests, and conflicts of ideas are becoming increasingly sharp. It is not possible to guarantee peace with empty words. In view of the serious losses and tragic sacrifices of the eight-year War of Resistance, we should have a deeper understanding and more adequate preparation for national defense in the future in order to protect our country's independence, freedom, and security. The great cause of national construction and army building must be completed with a unified situation and a considerable amount of time for preparation and implementation. If the communist bandits are not eliminated for one day, the country will not only be unable to unify, but will also directly invite foreign disasters. National construction and army building cannot be implemented. Therefore, to build the country and build the army, we must first eliminate the communist bandits, otherwise the country's future and the nation's destiny will be unimaginable. This is indeed the primary national policy for the country to overcome its difficulties and move towards prosperity and strength. (End)

### Adjust Tax Revenue, Solve Housing Shortage; Inventory and Valuation of Building Improvements; Old French Concession Area to be Handled First This Year

[Reported by this newspaper] The land general registration and land valuation in the four districts of Huangpu, Zhabei, Hubei South, and Fahua in the central area of ​​this city have been carried out in order. However, the valuation and registration of building improvements (houses) could not be carried out at the same time due to time, manpower, material resources, and other limitations. Although the former Bureau of Public Works had investigated a part of the houses in the old public concession area, most of the existing data is incomplete. The Municipal Finance Bureau had once planned to investigate the old French concession area, but it was not realized. Therefore, there is a lack of reliable basis for adjusting tax revenue and solving the housing shortage, which has a great impact on municipal construction. For this reason, the Municipal Land Administration Bureau intends to conduct a general survey and valuation of building improvements in the above-mentioned areas in order to understand the status of building improvements, the situation of convenient use, and their current value, as the basis for adjusting tax revenue and solving the housing shortage. Also, because the past cadastral and household registration systems have not been linked, it is very inconvenient for general administrative facilities. It is also planned to pay attention to the numbering of households and land in this survey to facilitate verification. This work is scheduled to be completed within one year. The old French Concession area will be handled first this year, and then it will be extended to other areas in the future.

Once Approved, It Can Be Started

The Land Administration Bureau has now drafted a plan for conducting a survey and valuation of building improvements in the old French Concession area and submitted it to the Municipal Government for approval. Once approved, the work can be started. The entire old French Concession area is calculated as one household per single room, one building (apartments, office buildings, residences, factories, and other large buildings are calculated proportionally), totaling approximately 48,000 households. The work process is divided into nine items: (1) Survey: In accordance with the land section, household-by-household surveys are conducted on the area of ​​the construction land, the area or volume of the building, the structure, the types of materials, the cost, the equipment, the owner of the land and buildings, the name of the user, the numbering of the land number and household registration number, and the general situation of its use, etc. A flat sketch is measured and drawn at any time, and a survey form is filled out as the basis for assessment.

If There is Discrepancy, Re-check at Any Time

(2) Drawing and Calculation: (A) Before the implementation of the survey, a fish scale map will be copied for use in the actual survey of sections. (B) According to the survey and mapping sketch, a 1/500 or 1/600 building plan sub-map will be drawn, and at the same time, the cadastral number will be checked, and a sub-map will be drawn. If there is any discrepancy, it must be re-checked at any time. After the re-check is completed, it will be handled according to the re-check results. (3) Assessment: (A) Collect the construction material sales index of building improvements over the years, the service life (depreciation rate) of various buildings, and the residual value of buildings after they are discarded, etc. (B) Based on the survey chart and the collected data, the current value will be meticulously assessed. If there is any doubt, a re-check will be conducted. (C) After the assessment is completed, each item will be numbered (it should be coordinated with the household land map).

Assessment Completed, Public Announcement Notification

(4) Re-check: If there is any doubt about the survey results or assessment, or if there is any discrepancy in the household land, or if the owner raises an objection, a staff member will be dispatched to re-check it in order to ensure accuracy. (5) Publication and Notification: After the assessment of each section of building improvements is completed, it will be published and notified in accordance with the law. (6) Evaluation: If the owner raises an objection after publication and notification, it will be evaluated by the Standard Land Price Evaluation Committee. (7) Registration: After publication and notification, if the owner has not raised an objection, or if the objection has been raised and the Standard Land Price Evaluation Committee has evaluated it, it will be the statutory value. A list of building improvement prices will be compiled, and at the same time, it will be compiled into the land registration book and the land price book.

### Seeking Revenge; Dancer Disfigured; Acid Thrown, Old Zhengxing a Scene of Groans; Old Grudge Not Resolved, Jin Lina Suffers Again

[Reported by this newspaper] Jin Lina (original name Du Juying, see Gang), a 24-year-old dancer at the Dahu Ballroom, is from Changzhou. She met a dancer named Lu Tingfang, 31 years old, in March this spring. They fell in love over time and finally lived together in the Longgong Hotel. However, Lu had no proper occupation and gradually squandered all of the woman's private savings. The woman, in a difficult situation, agreed to divorce, which happened in June of this year. At that time, the woman paid the man 4.3 million yuan in one lump sum, stating that they would not have any contact from then on.

After the divorce, the woman returned to the Dahu Ballroom and went back to sea. Lu still harassed her from time to time. On July 12, he took advantage of Jin's return home from dancing at night and attempted to harm her with acid in the Central Apartment on Jinling Road, but he did not achieve his purpose. Lu himself was arrested for being injured instead. Since then, Lu has harbored even more resentment. At about 7 o'clock last night, Lu learned that Jin and another dancer, Wu Lanfang, and four dancers were having dinner at the Lao Zhengxing Restaurant on Sanma Road, so he rushed there with a bottle of acid. When Jin was talking and laughing with the dancers, she was splashed with acid all over her face. The dancers at the scene rose up to block him, so they were also splashed with acid. Lu Tingfang panicked and injured his own head and hands.

The murderer was eventually caught by the dancers at the scene. At that time, groans were heard all over the second floor. During the confusion, in addition to Jin Lina's serious injuries to her face, another dancer, Wu Lanfang, and dancers Zhang Zhenyuan, Chen Jiangang, Wang Yongfu, Wang Yiming, and the waiter Zhu Chunhai were also burned, either on their faces or on their hands. After the incident, the owner of Lao Zhengxing reported to the police. The injured were first sent to Renji Hospital.

Executive Yuan President Zhang Qun, Legislative Yuan President Sun Ke, Examination Yuan President Dai Chuanxian, Control Yuan President Yu Youren, and Mr. Liu Yazi, among others, all sent elegies. Leaders from all circles of the city's party, government, and culture also came to express their condolences. The Jing'an Temple was filled with hundreds of white paper scrolls with elegiac couplets written in ink, creating a solemn and respectful atmosphere. More than 500 people attended the memorial service, including Mr. Hu's friends during his lifetime, Pan Gongzhan, Xu Jiqing, Wang Xiaolai, Feng Youzhen, Zhai Yifu, Xu Weinan, Zhang Yi, and Hu's relatives, friends, and disciples. At 3 PM, the memorial ceremony began. Mr. Pan Gongzhan presided over the ceremony. After playing mourning music, the presiding officer offered incense and flowers, and presented libations. Then, representatives from the National University Alumni Association, the Chih Tze University Alumni Association, and the Anhui Fellow-Provincials Association read memorial orations successively. All the mourners bowed three times to Mr. Hu's portrait. Mr. Pan Gongzhan first delivered a speech, stating that Mr. Hu Puan's character, learning, morality, thought, belief, and spirit were all worthy of the highest respect. Mr. Hu devoted himself to writing behind closed doors during the period when Shanghai was occupied, and his strong national consciousness and national concept, and his noble integrity and spirit, could not be achieved by those without cultivation. Therefore, Mr. Hu's greatness lies not only in his scholarship but also in his personality. Mr. Hu's expectations for young people were particularly earnest. He once said, "I hope that our young people will not be ancient Chinese, nor will they be modern foreigners." Although only a few words, the meaning is profound and can indeed serve as an indicator for our young people. Therefore, when we remember Mr. Hu today, we should inherit his immortal spirit and make it shine brightly. Afterwards, Mr. Zhai Yifu reported on Mr. Hu's life story, and Mr. Yan Duhe delivered a speech on behalf of the guests. Finally, after the Hu family expressed their gratitude, the memorial ceremony concluded in mourning music.

When the memorial service was held yesterday, there were many elegiac couplets from all walks of life. Mayor Wu Guozhen's elegiac couplet read: "Accumulating morality and capable of writing, his longstanding reputation weighs heavily in the Southeast; his conduct far surpasses Hu Anguo; encouraging Confucianism and valuing integrity, his high name will last throughout the universe; his life was similar to Gu Ningren."

### Li Ximou's Broadcast: Today's Education in Shanghai; Cultural Construction is a Manifestation of National Spirit; Hoping that Education Funding Can Be Appropriately Increased

[Our Dispatch] This newspaper held the 24th Sunday Special Broadcast at the Yuanchang Heming Radio Station yesterday, inviting Acting Director of the Education Bureau Li Ximou to broadcast on "Today's Education in Shanghai." The main points of his speech are recorded below:

The education in our city was severely damaged by the enemy and puppet regime during the period of occupation. At the beginning of the victory, the work done was restoration work. Not only did we have to remedy the past defects in material terms, but we also had to have new achievements in spiritual terms. Last year, we began to enter the stage of consolidation. Speaking of today's education in Shanghai, it can be divided into three categories: (1) secondary education, (2) national education, and (3) social education. In terms of secondary education, there are also higher vocational schools. There are currently three municipal vocational schools: A, Industrial Vocational School, which is divided into civil engineering, mechanical, and electrical engineering departments; B, Normal Vocational School, which trains teachers for primary and junior high schools; C, Physical Education Vocational School.

Preparing to Establish an Aquatic Vocational School

In addition, the municipal authorities are preparing to establish an aquatic vocational school because Shanghai has superior conditions for aquaculture and fisheries. The Executive Yuan Fisheries Administration Office, the Shanghai Fish Market, and the China Aquatic Products Company of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry are all concentrated in talent, making it very convenient to hold. The Education Bureau has submitted a request to the Ministry of Education for its establishment. There are sixteen municipal secondary schools and two hundred and sixty-seven private secondary schools. In terms of the number of students, municipal schools account for one-third, and private schools account for two-thirds. This is because although the number of municipal schools is small, the scale is larger, while the number of private schools is large, but the school buildings are smaller and can accommodate fewer students. There are more than two hundred and sixty municipal national schools and more than nine hundred private schools. The number of students in municipal schools is about 110,000, and the number of students in private schools is about 250,000, which is also a ratio of one to two. Judging from the above situation, private secondary schools and national schools have fulfilled considerable responsibilities for education in Shanghai. Without the existence of so many private schools, the problem of dropping out of school would be more serious.

Social Education Prioritizes Literacy

As for the difficulties in running schools, the funding is insufficient, the teachers' salaries are too low, which is lower than those of employees in the industrial and commercial sectors, and the equipment is inadequate. All physics and chemistry experimental equipment is missing, or although a few schools such as Gezhi and Yucai have better equipment, the equipment is old and needs to be supplemented and added. As for social education, the important issue is literacy. The Education Bureau has held more than 120 people's schools, ranging from three classes to five or six classes per school. However, I feel a little difficulty, that is, the number of people is very large when school starts, and then it gradually decreases, because most of the people who come to people's schools to study are adults. They have to work during the day to make a living, and they feel tired after a long time. How to improve their interest so that they can follow through to the end is an urgent issue for public education.

Funding is the Biggest Difficulty

As for public education centers, libraries, museums, art galleries, etc., they are necessary cultural constructions for a big city. Shanghai is the largest city in China. Foreigners come to China and take the first step into Shanghai. If they only see tall buildings but not national culture and art, wouldn't it be a shame for the people of Shanghai? Therefore, the municipal authorities plan to devote themselves to the cultural construction of Shanghai in the next few years. However, the biggest difficult problem in China today is the economic problem. The city's education expenses account for 20% of the city's budget. The number is not too small, but at a time when prices are high, it is still not enough. It is hoped that after the constitution is implemented in the future, education expenses can be appropriately increased. Cultural construction is a manifestation of national spirit, and the Municipal Education Bureau will do its best to make Shanghai not only the economic and industrial center of the country, but also the cultural and educational center of the country.

### Former Manager of the Savings and Remittance Bureau Accused of Embezzlement Reaching 100 Billion

[Our Dispatch] Shen Jing, the former manager of the Shanghai Branch of the Postal Savings and Remittances Bureau, was previously secretly reported to have falsely used account names to privately release exchange mortgages for profit, with embezzlement reaching 100 billion yuan. The case is currently under thorough investigation by the judicial authorities.

### Improved Cotton Seed Results: Taicang Area is the Best; Cotton Plants Can Be as Tall as a Person; Cotton Bolls are Solid and Plentiful

[Our Dispatch] The Cotton Production Improvement Office of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry yesterday hosted various circles in Shanghai to visit the American cotton promotion work done by the office in the counties near Shanghai. More than 30 people attended, including Mr. Shu Yunzhang, General Manager of China Textile Construction Company, Mr. Wu Weijing, Deputy General Manager, Mr. Doug, Agricultural Attache of the American Embassy, representatives of major yarn factories, and reporters from various newspapers. Around 9 AM in the morning, Director Hu Jingliang of the office took the bus together. Due to time constraints, only the main promotion areas of Jiangwan, Dachang, Zhenru, and Taicang were visited. Minister of Agriculture and Forestry Zuo Shunsheng arrived in Shanghai from Beijing yesterday morning and also took a special train to Taicang to participate in the inspection.

This year, the Cotton Production Improvement Office promoted cotton in the areas near Shanghai, including Fengxian, Nanhui, Chuansha, Taicang, Baoshan, Shanghai City, Changshu, Jiading, Kunshan, Jiangyin, Shanghai County, and Songjiang, totaling 12 counties and cities. Among them, Shanghai City, Taicang, Jiading, Baoshan, Fengxian, and Nanhui had the largest promotion area. The total promotion area in the entire area reached 64,991.4 mu.

There are three types of American cotton varieties promoted: Texas Cotton No. 531, Cole Cotton Hundred Series No. 1, and Dai Cotton. Farmers in Shanghai and Taicang areas used to grow Chinese cotton, which has short and coarse fibers and can only spin coarse yarns below 12 counts, and the yield is low. The yield of seed cotton per mu of cotton field is only about 100 jin. American cotton has large cotton bolls, long and abundant lint. The best-growing cotton field in this area is estimated to have a yield of seed cotton of up to 200 jin per mu. The ginning outturn is estimated to be from 32% to 40%.

Registering Cotton Fields; Issuing Seeds on Loan

According to the report of the Cotton Production Improvement Office: The implementation process of the office's promotion work: (1) Conducting cotton field registration, which was completed before the end of March. (2) Issuing seeds on loan: Each cotton farmer is lent 8 jin of seeds for each mu of cotton planted. This work was completed at the end of April. (3) Guiding sowing, thinning, and setting seedlings: Sowing started successively at the end of April, and the work above the thinning stage was completed at the end of May. Seedling setting work was carried out in early June. (4) Guiding mid-cultivation and weeding: The first work was carried out in May, and the second, third, and fourth works were carried out in June and July. (5) Setting up cotton seed management areas, actively managing cotton seeds. A cotton seed management area must be set up for all promotion cotton fields with more than 500 mu to maintain pure seeds for promotion next year. (6) Preventing and controlling diseases and insect pests. In the early seedling stage of cotton this year, a small number of aphids occurred. After autumn, leaf roller insects occurred again, and medicines and machinery were used to eliminate them with all efforts.

Farmers Bank Providing Loans

In order to solve the various production expenses required by cotton farmers when planting cotton, the office specially negotiated with the China Farmers Bank to provide production and in-kind loans. A loan of 15,000 yuan is given for each mu of cotton planted, which is collected by cotton farmer organizations such as cooperatives, farmers' associations, or association. Regarding the in-kind loan, there are three types of bean cake, ammonium nitrate, and calcium phosphate. The total amount of loans is approximately 2 billion yuan.

Yesterday's visit to the districts showed that the Taicang area is a demonstration area, so the improved cotton varieties planted have excellent results. The cotton plants can be as tall as a person, and the distance between each plant is moderate. The cotton bolls produced by each plant are particularly abundant and spectacular. Compared with the Chinese cotton planted next to it, the difference is obvious. The Sixth District Cotton Spinning Association specially set up a cotton breeding field in Zhenru, which has two-row trials, five-row trials, ten-row trials, and breeding areas of Texas cotton, etc., and the results are also not weak. According to the survey, the total output of lint cotton from American cotton in the first cotton production figures in various counties and cities in Shanghai this year is approximately more than 20,000 dan.

### The Fifth Army's Recruitment Exam Confirmed; Female Heroes Travel Together Across the River

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 14th] Peng Bolun of the Fifth Army's Information Office and 27 female political workers recruited in Shanghai and Hangzhou left Nanjing at about 5 AM on the 14th and crossed the river to Pukou to go to Xuzhou. They arrived in Nanjing on the 13th. After strict inquiries by the military police, they were deemed suspicious and were temporarily detained at the Dahua Hotel in Xiaguan. Later, after the military police inquired about the facts from Shanghai and Xuzhou, they learned that the recruitment of political workers was indeed the case. However, the procedures were not fully completed when they left Shanghai, which led to misunderstandings. After the military police learned the truth, they were allowed to leave for Xuzhou that day. The Information Office of the army had also set up a recruitment agency in Nanjing, but it had taken the recruited female personnel to Xuzhou a few days ago.

### China Trust Bureau Warehouse Fire Suspicious

[Our Dispatch] At about 7 AM yesterday morning, thick smoke suddenly billowed from the Central Trust Bureau warehouse office on the fifth floor of the Baomei Foreign Company at the intersection of Dongda Ming Road and Gaoyang Road. Fortunately, the gatekeeper Li Hanbin discovered it and urgently called the fire department to send a car to extinguish the fire. The fire was extinguished at 8:10 AM. The loss of miscellaneous items was still light. However, the Yangshupu Police Sub-Bureau believed that no one was originally on duty on the fifth floor, and the carelessness was suspicious. The gatekeeper was taken to the bureau for questioning.

### Cargo Ship Catches Fire at Pudong Merchants Wharf

[Our Dispatch] Cargo ship No. 105, which was docked at the fourth quay of the Pudong Merchants Bureau, caught fire at about 1 AM yesterday morning. The cargo in the cabin was mostly miscellaneous goods. It took two hours to extinguish the fire, and the loss was still light.

### Preparing to Host Christian Education Representatives; A Record of Inspecting the Exhibition Venue

[Special Feature by Our Newspaper] In order to educate the next generation and popularize scientific culture, the United Nations Far East Regional Fundamental Education Research Conference was held in Nanjing for ten days. After exchanging information on the implementation of fundamental education in various countries, it was determined that education has supreme potential for international cultural communication; representatives from Australia, India, Myanmar, Egypt, and Nepal, who came from afar, arrived in Shanghai last night to stay for one and a half days to visit the city's fundamental education institutions. The Municipal Government Education Bureau and the education and cultural circles had established a reception committee several weeks ago to prepare for the reception. Yesterday, various exhibitions and performances were arranged. The reception committee specially invited relevant parties to inspect the exhibition venues for the final beautification.

At 9 AM, more than 20 reception committee members, including Acting Director Li, Director Zhu Junti, Chen Yunqin, Huang Renjian, Hu Shuyi, Shu Xincheng, and Lu Guanliu, gathered at Wanzhu Primary School in Luxiang Garden, Nanshi, to appreciate the achievements of children's labor and art in the large classroom at the west end of the spacious playground. The four walls were covered with watercolor paintings, charcoal paintings, carvings, embroidery, etc. made by elementary school students. The tables were full of agricultural tools, furniture, textile machines, and transportation vehicles, from wooden plows, benches, hand-cranked spinning wheels, and wheelbarrows from the "primitive" era to threshing machines, sofas, spindle iron spinning wheels, trains, steamers, and airplanes from the "atomic" era, showing the daily renewal of science and the monthly change of culture. The most eye-catching thing in the room was the three-dimensional model of the ideal Pujiang Iron Bridge. The bridge was crowded with vehicles, and the river surface was full of boats. It really met the ideal. The plan to build a bridge across the river is a model in the design

### Teaching Aids

Two "Language Subject Spoken Composition Achievement Rooms" display literacy tools, such as square characters, phonetic symbol usage, new word card boxes, public literacy signs, pronunciation illustrations, etc., which are simple, eye-catching, and orderly. "Quadrilateral Character Checking Pen Shape and Number Identification Board" in a corner of the room is a new invention. The board is divided into two parts, one for pen shape and one for number. There are electric button holes at the upper end of each pen shape and number, and there are small light bulbs at the rear. To know which number a certain pen shape belongs to, just insert the electric plug in the center of the board into the electric button hole at the upper end of that pen shape, and the number to be found on the number board on the left will be illuminated by the light bulb behind it, which is very convenient. The next room is the "Language Subject Composition Achievement Exhibition." A "Ten-Usage Language Teaching Tool" in the center is another novel teaching aid, invented by Xu Ziling of the 19th District Central National School, to simplify the steps of learning to make sentences and write compositions. Its "ten uses" are: (1) serial stories, (2) jigsaw puzzles, (3) couplet boards, (4) filling sentence boards, (5) homophone flipping boards, (6) contrasting character flipping boards, (7) radical character insertion, (8) adding stroke character insertion, (9) poem riddle character insertion, (10) model character board. "To do a good job, one must first sharpen one's tools." To popularize education, there must be more "sharp tools," but the cost of this kind of teaching aid is not small. One piece cannot be done without more than 3 million yuan, which is really not something that our country after eight years of the War of Resistance can mass-produce. In the "Language Subject Writing Achievement Room," the calligraphy exhibition of elementary school students fully demonstrates the talents of some excellent children. Wang characters with iron strokes and silver hooks, Yan characters with dignity and fullness, and Su characters with dragons flying and phoenixes dancing indicate where the artistic traces of the Chinese nation lie.

A Three-and-a-Half-Year-Old Band Conductor

Leaving Wanzhu, the whole group went to the First Central National School in the Fifth District. After inspecting the orange-walled and green-windowed, bright, clean, and quiet building for a week, they hurriedly boarded the bus and drove straight to the Female Normal School Affiliated Primary School on Yuyuan Road to watch a children's music performance. At the stage, more than a dozen girls were performing "Neon Clothes Feather Dress Song." Then came "Rhythm Music." A group of kindergarten students sat in rows, playing bronze instruments following the piano. The little conductor (three and a half years old) holding a baton, actually has the demeanor of a musician. Other programs include chorus, national music, etc.

### The Vast Sea of Chinese Collection

At noon, the group rushed to the Editorial Department of Zhonghua Book Company to watch the literacy film produced by Shu Xincheng and Jin Zhaozhi, and visit more than 7,400 books on various fundamental education aspects displayed by Zhonghua, including enlightenment, Chinese, writing, arithmetic, common sense, civics, history, geography, etc., more than 30 types, with many titles, it can be said that from astronomy to geography, nothing is not "available." The "Zhonghua" collection room has more than 660,000 books, especially many famous ancient books. They also have the first issue of this newspaper, which was published 75 years ago. In addition, the education toys, animal specimens, and physical and chemical experimental instruments made by the bureau itself are displayed on the fourth floor, which can be regarded as representative works of domestic products, competing with imported products. Finally, Shu Xincheng, the editor-in-chief of Zhonghua, hosted a lunch for the whole group. On the way back, the reporter seemed to see thousands of innocent and happy elementary school children, regardless of wealth or poverty, receiving scientific and progressive education, showing a new China without internal strife, unified, democratic, and strong!

### Shen Bao Scholarship; Deadline Approaching; Impoverished Students Urgently Need Assistance; Appealing to All Circles to Give Compassion

As the days go by, the deadline for the special fundraising for the "Reader Scholarship" is also approaching day by day. The total amount of donations is still a long way from the expected goal. For the sake of countless impoverished students' studies and the future of countless promising young people, we shouted and appealed with all our might, but this cruel society did not give us much sympathy and assistance. Countless students are still eagerly looking forward to assistance and relief.

Providing assistance to a person who is suffering may be more meaningful than praising a person who is in a happy environment! So, dear readers, why don't you give these impoverished young people more practical benefits and more assistance?

The "Reader Scholarship" will close for donations on the 22nd of this month. The short seven days will pass like a meteor. We hope that dear readers can provide urgent assistance to those who need it within the seven days.

Yesterday, we received a donation of 2 million yuan from reader Rao Zhongyang's banquet savings. Other people from Wufu Advertising Company have also put in a lot of effort for us. We would like to thank you here.

### Our First Aid Ship; Jianji, Has Perfect Equipment; A Record of Rescuing the Hai Zhe and a Visit

[Our Dispatch] The Jianji, the rescue ship of China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, was converted from the Min 118. It set off for the first time on August 7 to rescue the Hai Zhe, which ran aground in Jinmen. After being rescued and sent to Keelung for repairs, it returned to Shanghai on the 6th of this month. The round trip took one month, and the results of the initial rescue project were satisfactory. The captain of the ship is Fan Lun, the head of the maritime section of the company's shipping department. Lin Jinxin is the chief mate, both of whom have rich navigation experience. The conversion of rescue equipment was also designed by Captain Fan and supervised by Chief Mate Lin, so all the equipment is complete.

Yesterday, the ship hosted reporters to visit. Captain Fan led the boarding and Chief Mate Lin led the tour, explaining everything in detail. The ship has a total tonnage of 800 tons, a diesel engine, a total of 1,200 horsepower, a speed of 13 nautical miles per hour, and can tow a 10,000-ton giant ship. All the equipment is no less than a warship. According to Captain Fan, this rescue ship is the first of its kind in our country. He is very happy with the success of rescuing the Hai Zhe this time. He will continue to add rescue tools to make it a perfect rescue ship. In the future, it will not only be convenient for the company itself, but also happy to assist other companies when ships have maritime accidents.

### Lifting of Grain Restrictions in Hunan – Unimaginable Consequences

[Special Dispatch from Changsha, 10th] Hunan is the "granary" of the nation, yet paradoxically, the price of grain has skyrocketed during storage. This rapid price surge has created chaos in the market and widespread anxiety. The common people haven't forgotten that just over a month ago, the highest price for top-quality early rice was only around 100,000 yuan per dan. However, even with the new late rice from the lake region fully on the market and the rest of the region "harvesting in full swing," the price has surged to over 180,000 yuan per dan in the past month. The common people also clearly understand the inside story of this price surge: it's not due to a poor harvest or lack of supply; it's simply that the government shouldn't have "lifted restrictions" and allowed rice merchants from Nanjing, Shanghai, Hankou, and Guangdong to come to Hunan and carry away the yellow, glistening grain that sustains the 30 million people of Hunan.

The Grain Price Surge

began after the resolution to "lift grain restrictions" was passed at the Provincial Government Committee meeting on July 16th. This resolution was passed with the prior consent of the Provincial Senate and adopted a recommendation from the Provincial Education Association: for every dan of grain transported out of the province, a donation of 5,000 yuan would be collected for education to assist in the recovery of education. This measure by the Provincial Government is very "democratic." As for the reasons for passing this resolution, it was stated that: given the current (mid-July) transportation capacity on all lines, the maximum amount of grain transported out of the province each month would not exceed 500,000 dan (referring to unhusked rice), which would total 2.5 million dan in the remaining five months of the year. Furthermore, considering the surplus grain in the province: in a normal year, the yield of staple grains is approximately 120 million dan, and miscellaneous grains are 28 million dan; the actual grain requirement of the province is 115 million dan, leaving a surplus of over 30 million dan; however, this year is a bumper harvest, with an estimated yield of staple grains reaching 150 million dan, which means there is a surplus of over 30 million dan compared to a normal year. Since there is no fear of grain shortage in the province, a "grain famine" is unlikely to occur, and therefore, grain is unlikely to become the target of manipulation or speculation.

Based on this so-called "accurate estimate," Hunan grain was very easily "deregulated"!

On July 21st, the "Grain Export Registration Office" was established in Changsha to handle registration and collection of donations. Inspection points were set up in Changsha, Jinggang, Xiangyin, Lulin Tan, Chenglingji in Yueyang, Zhucikou, Meitianhu, Dianjiaoxu in Huarong, Sanxianhu in Nanxian, Meijingyao in Anxiang, Huangshahe in Siqi Southeast, and Bailing in Yizhang.

The next day, the Provincial Government held a meeting and passed a proposal to allocate 50,000 dan of rice to Guangdong.

From then on, abnormal phenomena gradually unfolded in the Hunan grain market: rice merchants from this province desperately transported grain out, while rice merchants from other provinces poured into the lake region to purchase grain. Especially in the past half-month, an average of about 25,000 dan of grain was transported out daily through registration procedures, and it is unknown how much was smuggled out. As of August 29th, the education donations collected had reached over 3.3 billion yuan. Based on this figure, the amount of grain transported out in the forty days from July 21st to August 29th reached over 700,000 dan. This exceeded the official original estimate by more than one-third. Therefore, the price of grain soared endlessly!

The lake region produces approximately 16 million dan of grain annually, while the local demand is approximately 13 million dan. Judging from the current situation, the surplus grain is insufficient for three months of transportation. A poor harvest in the lake region would certainly cause a grain shortage throughout the province. Moreover, selling out all the grain from the lake region may not necessarily satisfy the rice merchants' greed. Therefore, the fertile fields on both banks of the Xiang River and the Zi River are constantly in danger of being devoured by rice weevils.

At the same time, to support the suppression of the rebellion, half of the one million dan of military grain must be delivered by the end of September. The Provincial Government has already dispatched senior officials to the eleven counties in the lake region to supervise the requisition. The people of Hunan have survived many calamities. They have suffered from war and natural disasters, and they will never forget the taste of white clay, tree bark, and grass roots. Therefore, they all predict what unfortunate consequences will arise from the constant outflow of grain.

Changsha is the nerve center of Hunan, so the soaring grain prices are particularly sensitive to the stimulation of citizens' lives and emotions. On September 3rd, they petitioned the municipal government, demanding price controls. However, the municipal government, having experienced "price increases after price controls" several times and given the recent frenzy of exporting grain throughout the province, could not "control" anything. Therefore, it pushed the responsibility to the Provincial Government in two sentences, saying: as long as the Provincial Government reinstates the ban, things will be easy to handle. Now, judging from the new trend of the Provincial Government, the reinstatement of the ban on grain exports should not be far off. (Li Yuren)

### Key Figure in Fujian Grain Embezzlement Case, Lin Zipei, Released on Bail, Parades Through the City in a "Romantic" Car

[Special Dispatch from Fuzhou, 11th] Lin Zipei, the deputy director of the Lin Sen County Grain Department, abused his power while in office, extorting grain from various townships, embezzling over 500 million yuan in verifiable cases. This is another grain embezzlement case following the Rongfeng Rice Company case in Fuzhou last year, and it has attracted great attention from all parties. After the Fujian Provincial Grain Department submitted the relevant case files to the Fuzhou District Court for trial last month, he was prosecuted for crimes of embezzlement and dereliction of duty. He was ultimately sentenced to four years of imprisonment and three years of deprivation of civil rights, which was well received by the people. Unexpectedly, the District Court restored his freedom on the second day after the sentence under the pretext of granting him bail due to illness. According to those familiar with the situation: the judge in charge did not open a court hearing to pronounce the sentence but instead had it executed by the District Prosecutor's Office. On the day after his imprisonment, he was released on bail due to illness. Since the offender is a criminal, if he has a serious illness and needs to seek medical treatment outside, it should be certified by a forensic doctor. Lin did not go through this procedure and was released immediately. The court cannot escape responsibility. Yesterday, Lin drove his "romantic" car (i.e., a tricycle) and paraded through the city, which was regarded by all parties as a particularly egregious case of moral decay. People could not help but sigh for the dignity of the judiciary. All newspapers today published this news, emphasizing that judicial administration should be thoroughly reformed. It is reported that the Provincial Government has sent a letter to the Fuzhou District Court to inquire about the reasons for Lin's release on bail.

### The Basic Education of China – Suggestions from Our Delegation to the Basic Education Association

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 14th Dispatch] The Far East Basic Education Research Conference held in our capital, which convened from the 3rd to the 12th of this month, for a total of ten days, our Chinese delegation made suggestions regarding "Basic Education in China," and specially issued the following suggestions in writing after the meeting: (1) The goal of basic education in our country, in addition to earnestly promoting it in accordance with the provisions of current laws and regulations, should especially emphasize the improvement of individual life, the enhancement of social economy, and the increase of international understanding, so as to realize the ideals of people's livelihood, happiness and world harmony. (2) The promotion of basic education in our country must be like two wings working together, with adult literacy education and children's education advancing simultaneously, without any undue emphasis or neglect. (3) The experimental plans for basic education in our country should be coordinated with the domestic political, economic, social, and cultural realities, and the trends of world educational thought, to make choices. (4) Since basic education aims to improve the entire lives of those being educated, agriculture, industry, and various other industries should be important factors. To effectively promote it, it is impossible for educational administrative agencies to complete the task alone. Therefore, the government should have a comprehensive plan, uniting the departments of health, society, agriculture and forestry, water conservancy, economy, internal affairs, and related agencies, to cooperate and promote it in coordination, so as to achieve the effect of division of labor and cooperation. (5) Basic education should be organized by local areas in principle, but the central government should also provide strong technical guidance and sufficient economic subsidies.

Popularizing Basic Education Expected Within No More Than Ten Years

(6) The central government should re-establish a concrete plan for popularizing basic education by year that is practical and feasible. The compulsory education for school-age children should be increased in years, extended to six years (border areas may be tentatively set at four years), and the content of adult literacy education should be enriched and its efficiency increased. The period for popularizing basic education should not exceed ten years from now. (7) In the national education expenditures of famous countries, basic education expenditures account for the vast majority. Currently, only 30 percent of our country's national education expenditure is used for basic education, which is the main reason why basic education is not easy to develop. In the future, the central government should allocate at least 15 percent of the total education expenditure to run and subsidize basic education, and should designate tax revenue as a source of funding for local basic education. When necessary, with the consent of local public opinion organs, a special basic education tax may be levied for special management. (8) In addition to the government establishing a large number of teacher training institutions to cultivate sufficient teachers, private individuals may also establish them to meet the needs, but they must still follow the guidelines of teacher education and the provisions of the training plan. (9) Basic education staff should have reasonable employment and protection, and their treatment must be improved. In addition to a sufficient increase in base salary, living allowances should be paid according to the standards of civil servants, and a system of annual salary increases, old-age pensions, and academic advancement should be implemented. (10) County and city education bureaus should be quickly and universally restored to their full capacity, and their powers should be improved and their treatment improved, so as to professionalize educational administration and increase administrative efficiency.

Current Textbooks Adopt Both Review and Approval System

(11) The curriculum of basic education should be more practical and useful, and leave room for flexibility to adapt to local needs. The current textbooks should be widely collected from experts in all fields, discussed, edited, and improved, and a review and approval system should be adopted to allow for open competition in order to obtain good books. Reading materials for children and the public should be fully edited and improved to be widely available and for long-term supply. New and effective methods and tools should be introduced and encouraged as much as possible, and researched and tested to continuously improve them. (12) In promoting language education, the national phonetic alphabet should be used, the teaching of the national language should be vigorously promoted, the vocabulary and lexicon should be standardized, and the complexity of the characters should be simplified to increase the efficiency of education. (13) In order to provide a demonstration for the promotion of basic education, experimental areas should be selected in accordance with the principles of Article 3, in conjunction with relevant agencies and educational academic groups, to concentrate human and financial resources to study and improve practical and effective methods of education and life, in order to advocate them. And encourage and assist local areas to gradually promote this demonstration design. (14) Encourage private individuals to establish schools, and encourage educational academic groups to study educational methods, in order to improve the quality and quantity of basic education. (15) In order to promote basic education and promote its popularization, the Ministry of Education and local educational administrative agencies should convene experts to determine a plan and work together to realize it quickly.

This gathering of leaders and experts from the national industrial and commercial sectors is a grand event.

### Taiwan Province Representatives Offer Three Suggestions

The delegation of seven representatives from the Taiwan Provincial Federation of Chambers of Commerce attending the National Foreign Trade Conference, led by head Huang Zaisheng, arrived in Shanghai and yesterday released a written statement outlining the difficult situation in Taiwan and making three proposals for the National Foreign Trade Conference:

(1) Taiwan Province has the conditions for a solid industrial base, and its modern cultural and economic organization makes it easy to improve efficiency, so it should have a very important position in China's foreign trade. For the needs of industrial and commercial reconstruction, production equipment should be supplied in a planned manner from Japanese reparations. If this is insufficient, it is requested that the National Foreign Trade Conference suggest that the government relax controls and allow private imports. The implementation guidelines for organizing a business delegation to Japan should stipulate that medicines and medical equipment, fishing gear, raw materials for straw hats, and exported sugar, salt-processed products, and cassava flour (slurry flour) not be included in the list of goods imported and exported to Japan. (2) The Bank of Taiwan has not yet been designated as a bank authorized to handle foreign exchange, which causes many obstacles to trade in Taiwan and makes development impossible. It is requested that the government be advised to designate the Bank of Taiwan as a bank authorized to handle foreign exchange. (3) In order to develop trade and improve economic efficiency, it is requested that the government be advised to sell public enterprises as quickly as possible, and during the transition period, a part of their products should be allocated to private trading companies for management.

### Commander Xuan Orders Strict Prohibition of Rice Exports

The recent surge in rice prices in the city has been a great concern to Commander Xuan. Yesterday, he ordered a strict ban on rice exports and instructed the Water Police Brigade to be responsible for handling the matter. The brigade commander, Feng Zhongda, convened a cadre meeting yesterday morning to discuss countermeasures. It was decided to send personnel to the Pudong River export point to conduct strict patrols. Ships found to be loading rice without unloading and suspected of hoarding, or ships loading rice (including flour and miscellaneous grains) for export, will be detained and submitted for processing.

### Private Yarn Mills Propose Organizing a Joint Yarn Market Export Organization

[Reported by this newspaper] Rong Hongyuan of the cotton textile industry, considering that the export of yarn and cloth is extremely restricted after the war, and the future of the textile industry is greatly affected, proposed a plan for the export of yarn and cloth to the National Trade Conference in order to compete for overseas markets and maintain the survival of private yarn mills. The reasons for his suggestions are summarized as follows:

In order to promote China's export trade, earn foreign exchange, and strengthen the production capacity of the textile industry, it is proposed that private yarn mills organize a joint yarn and cloth export organization. Since the restriction on yarn and cloth exports in China, the effect on suppressing prices has been minimal, while yarn and cloth industry peers are currently threatened by international textile competition and the shortage of foreign exchange, making it impossible to fully prepare raw materials, expand machinery, and increase production. Surrounded by the above-mentioned new environment, if China does not actively establish overseas yarn and cloth markets in the future, the textile industry will have no future. The state-owned Textile Construction Corporation is actively promoting the export of yarn and cloth in order to enrich foreign exchange resources, and has signed sales contracts with overseas Chinese merchants, adopting the principle of importing raw cotton and exporting finished products to expand overseas markets. It is heard that their further plan is to set up warehouses in Hong Kong, Singapore, Siam, Manila, and other places to meet local needs. From this point of view, state-owned yarn and cloth exports have a monopolistic trend. If private yarn and cloth are not opened for export at the same time at this time, it is not enough to talk about the possibility of comprehensive development of the cotton textile industry's foreign trade in the future. Regarding this issue, the economic reform plan passed by the National Economic Commission stipulates that the state-owned sector should provide 20% of its production volume for yarn and cloth exports, and the private sector should provide 10% to 20%. In order to survive, our private textile industry should seize the opportunity and promote yarn and cloth exports. In order to avoid international encroachment and prevent self-competition and the damage of foreign merchants taking advantage of price suppression, it is proposed that the conference put forward a cautious discussion and request the government to support it. The private yarn mills jointly organize a yarn and cloth export organization, unify exports, earn foreign exchange, order foreign cotton, and allocate it to various private yarn mills to increase production. Then, suppressing prices can also be effective, and the improvement of the factory's machinery, equipment, and technology can be gradually perfected.

### Large Batch of Gold Shipped from Philippines to Australia; Value $2 Million

[United Press Manila, 13th] According to the Evening News, a batch of gold valued at US$2 million, weighing 43,760 taels, was transported to Macau by amphibious aircraft on the 12th. The Philippine government previously banned the export of gold in July at the request of the International Monetary Fund, but recently, due to pressure from gold merchants, the Ministry of Finance had to amend the ban, allowing this batch of gold transshipped from Mexico via Manila to reach its destination.

Another report states that President Roxas issued an order on the 12th to relax the ban on the transshipment and export of gold, allowing those who held licenses before July 19 of this year to export the gold that they actually had in the Philippines. The date coincides with the day the International Monetary Fund asked all member countries to ban gold shipments to non-members. The Ministry of Finance stated that if the holder of a transshipment license cannot prove that the gold they want to export is indeed in the Philippines, their license will be revoked. At the same time, the Atok Gold Mining Company has resumed mining. The Big Wedge Mine near Baguio mined gold worth US$203,269 in August. The Mindanao Gold Mining Company will start mining this month, and the produced gold nuggets can be listed on the San Francisco Gold Exchange within one or two months. However, mining industry insiders said that if the gold price is not raised from the current US$35 per tael, it will be difficult for Philippine gold exports to reach pre-war standards.

Increased Gold Production in the United States

[United Press Washington, 13th] The Bureau of Mines announced today that the rate of gold unearthed in the United States in July was the highest since 1942. The net production was 197,148 ounces, an increase of 30,000 ounces compared to June and an increase of 19% compared to the same month last year. The main reason is that large-scale production has resumed in Alaska this season.

### Industrial and Commercial Guidance Office Conducts Factory Surveys in Groups

[Reported by this newspaper] The city's Industrial and Commercial Guidance Office is actively conducting factory surveys. The office has obtained a special fund to hire more than 30 temporary investigators, who have been surveying various factories in groups since the 6th of this month. The investigators are all university graduates or vocational school graduates with service experience. There are also 100 specially appointed investigators, who are students from Shanghai Provincial High School, assisting in everything. It is planned to survey nearly 10,000 factories. The objects of the survey are (1) the general situation of factory personnel, (2) the equipment situation, (3) raw materials and products, (4) the power situation, and (5) the technician situation. It is expected to complete all the work within three months. This year, industrial and commercial guidance offices across the country have launched factory surveys in their respective locations. The scope of the survey will be expanded next year.

### Edible Oil Market Opens Today

The edible oil market was closed for one day last Saturday and is scheduled to open this morning. If the Central Trust Bureau's new method of selling edible oil is not approved by Governor Zhang of the Central Bank this morning, sales may be temporarily suspended for today and tomorrow, and major manufacturers will allocate their oil reserves. The relevant department of the Social Affairs Bureau is revising the trading rules of the edible oil market and will implement them after being reviewed and approved by the competent authorities. The police will send personnel to supervise the market today, and those who violate the market rules will be strictly dealt with.

### China Textile Construction Corporation Valuation Completed

Based on 1937 Prices, Approximately Worth Around 100 Million Yuan

The asset valuation work of the China Textile Construction Corporation has been completed after re-examination. It is reported that the total value of all assets, based on 1937 prices, is approximately worth around 100 million yuan. This figure includes assets in Tianjin and Qingdao, but does not include the Northeast. It is heard that the valuation committee will carefully consider multiplying the total accounted value by an appropriate multiple before reporting it to the Executive Yuan for approval, and then the sales procedures can be handled.

### Bank of China to Establish a Branch in Siam

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 13th] According to diplomatic sources, the Bank of China plans to open a branch in Bangkok, Siam. The Siamese side had previously refused to agree. After active negotiations by our embassy in Siam with the Siamese government, it is now known that the Siamese parliament passed a bill on September 4 allowing the Bank of China to open a branch. The remittance problem of Siamese Chinese will be reasonably resolved in the future.

### Asphalt Autumn Sales Launched; Price Increases Forty Times Compared to Last Year

Although the sales volume of Zhejiang asphalt in this city is not as wide as that produced in Hubei, its position is also quite important. There are three types of products: "Heben, Pingyou, and Lanyou," with "Heben" as the standard, and the price fluctuations in the market are mainly based on Heben. Pingyou and Lanyou are currently out of stock and contain moisture, so they are not as popular as Hubei's "Macheng, Jianma, Chaixue, and Jingbai" oils. Currently, Zhejiang oil is in short supply, and inventories are scarce. The prices in Hubei oil-producing areas are high, and transportation is obstructed. Recently, candle and towel factories have launched autumn sales, and demand is strong. Yesterday, the price of "Heben" oil per market load had floated to 2 million yuan, an increase of up to 40 times compared to the same day last year.

### Textile Industry Requests an Increase in the Number of National Representatives and Legislators

[Reported by this newspaper] In order to request an increase in the number of national representatives and legislators in the textile industry, the National Yarn Mill Federation convened its 23rd joint meeting of directors and supervisors in Shanghai on the 5th and decided to send Wu Weijing, Zhu Zhuyi, and Liu Piji as representatives to Beijing. They requested an increase in the number of national representatives in the textile industry to four and the number of legislators to two. Wu and his party returned to Shanghai a few days ago. According to reports, the Beijing meeting submitted petitions to the Legislative Yuan and the Ministry of Social Affairs, making three requests: (1) Increase the number of representatives. (2) Important industries should be reasonably allocated. (3) The number of seats occupied by the yarn mill industry should be determined. It is heard that the Legislative Yuan stated that the increase in the number of representatives only needs to be passed by the State Council before it can be submitted to the Legislative Yuan to complete the legislative process, and the Ministry of Social Affairs also agreed in principle to all requests.

### Forerunner of the Renaissance – Commemorating the Death of Dante

— Yan Zhewu

— Written for the European Renaissance Festival

The transition from the dark ages of medieval Europe to modern times underwent a period of ideological transformation, which was the Renaissance movement. This movement was a religious innovation, a cultural revival and rebirth, but also a movement to resist theocracy, the Pope, and asceticism; and to establish a "worldly thought" that valued reason, nature, individuality, and freedom.

According to the classification of general art historians, the Renaissance can be roughly divided into three periods:

The first period is the period of natural development.

The second period is the period of antiquity imitation.

The third period is the period of heterodox art.

In the first period, there were three major figures as its representatives, namely Dante, Petrarch, and Boccaccio. Among them, Dante Alighieri, although a medieval poet, was actually the founding ancestor of modern thought and the forerunner of the Renaissance!

Speaking of Dante, he was a tall man, often wearing a gray robe, a red crown on his head, surrounded by laurel leaves. Although he had a melancholic eagle-like face, he was the hero in the world's most bizarre and beautiful love story. He was born in Florence in 1265. At the age of nine, he met the girl Beatrice. Without exchanging a word, he fell in love at first sight, considering her the first joy of his soul. At the age of eighteen, he met the girl again, and both times they remained silent. Later, Beatrice got married, and died at the age of thirty-five. Dante wrote about her death:

"When I lost the 'first joy of my soul', I was pierced by sorrow, and there was nothing to comfort me."

Later, this love story was narrated in Dante's book: "The New Life".

Dante's greatest work in his life is "The Divine Comedy." It contains all the most beautiful and bizarre things in the Catholic Church. In it, you can see the essence of medieval philosophy, theology, and chivalry. The structure is magnificent, the ideas are sublime, the characters are bizarre and complex, the imagination is rich, and the writing is timeless! Some say that Dante is the only Latin who can compete with Shakespeare. In modern times, Dante is the only one who can compete with Homer!

Dante married at the age of thirty-one. In middle age, he was exiled due to political activities and wandered for the rest of his life. His will after his death: "I swear not to return my bones to my hometown." He died on September 14, 1321.

After being expelled from Florence, he traveled around, during which time he completed his great work "The Divine Comedy." Therefore, his own life is often scattered and narrated in the supernatural facts of "The Divine Comedy," including his own sad and moving love story; political struggles, and political affairs related to him.

"The Divine Comedy" is a book depicting "Heaven," "Hell," and "Purgatory." On the surface of the text, it is a fantasy about the state of the soul after death. In terms of allegory, it refers to the need for spiritual illumination and guidance.

The shape of "Hell" is a boundless trap, like an inverted cone, with its apex in the center. There are ten layers in this hell, and the most sinful people are in the lowest layer. Each layer has various bizarre descriptions, written as if it were a living reality.

"Purgatory," in Dante's imagination, is under the open sky. Around the mountain surrounding Purgatory, there are seven circles, each corresponding to one of the seven deadly sins recognized by the medieval church. In the lower layer are the sins of the traced soul, which, after touring the last layer of "Purgatory," enters the "Earthly Paradise" and sees Beatrice sitting in a chariot, surrounded by hundreds of little angels singing and scattering flowers. "Heaven" is the most glorious place in "The Divine Comedy." Dante traveled through the "Nine Heavens," "some fixed and immovable day!" Above the eight "heavens," the ninth heaven is the "crystal heaven," whose movement can guide the daily actions of the heavens. Nature, time, and motion all originate from this; all the divine influences in the world also originate from this. Above this heaven, the apex of that illusion is the infinite and motionless divine "Sea of Love."

This masterpiece of rich imagination is the product of Dante's twenty years of wandering and poverty. Therefore, his "Divine Comedy" opens with the words:

"When I was halfway through my life, I got lost and fell into the dark forest!"

In short, "The Divine Comedy" represents the summary of Dante's thoughts. It is written in Italian "vulgar" language, not in ancient language. Although it is based on the Middle Ages, its spirit and appearance are modern. Therefore, it is said that Dante and his great work "The Divine Comedy" are the founding ancestors and forerunners of the Renaissance!

Editor's Note: Dante, a literary giant who lived 626 years ago, is not only memorable for his beautiful and moving love story, nor is he only memorable for his immortal masterpiece—The Divine Comedy, nor is he only memorable for his participation in political movements; just as medieval commentators did not regard him as a great poet, but as an intelligent prophet. What we should recognize more is the philosopher's philosophy and thought and its influence; he is the bridge between the Middle Ages and the Renaissance. Therefore, general historians use the year of his death (1321) to divide the Middle Ages and the Modern Ages, which is indeed very meaningful. It is a pity that our country still does not have a complete translation of "The Divine Comedy" that can be used for introduction.

This article was originally scheduled to be published on the 14th, but due to temporary space limitations, it has been changed to today. This statement is attached.

### North Sea Painting Exhibition and Cheng Zhu Painting Exhibition

— Yu Jianhua

On the September 18th Memorial Day, there will be two painting exhibitions in Shanghai;

One is the painting exhibition of Mr. Zhu Yingpeng held in the Chinese Art Garden, and the other is the painting exhibition of Ms. Ling Chengzhu held in the Youth Association.

Although these two painting exhibitions are held at the same time, their painting styles are completely different, which can be an interesting contrast. Before seeing their works, if we infer the styles of the two based on general ideals, thinking that the paintings of men are always grand and majestic, and the paintings of women are always graceful and beautiful, then the paintings of these two are quite the opposite. The paintings of men are graceful and beautiful, while the paintings of women are grand and majestic. The paintings of men have a bit of femininity, while the paintings of women have a bit of masculinity.

Mr. Yingpeng, also known as Beihai, is one of the veterans in the Shanghai art world. He originally studied traditional Chinese painting, and then studied Western painting for more than 20 years. After September 18th, he began to specialize in traditional Chinese painting again. He is generous and heroic, and thinks highly of himself, but the paintings he makes are meticulous and meticulous, small and exquisite, without any unrestrained habits. His profound light and light color, a kind of quiet and elegant interest, can make the viewers release their irritability and vanity, and remove their vulgar thoughts. "A hundred refined steels turn into a soft finger" "The extreme of splendor returns to plainness", the high realm of painting is truly admirable. The paintings do not include inscriptions, let alone poems. The inscriptions are written on the poetry hall after the decoration, which is especially in line with the relics of the Tang and Song people. His daughter, Ms. Mingwang, specializes in Tang Dynasty dancers, and also exhibited 30 works this time, all of which are extremely exquisite.

Ms. Chengzhu is from a prominent family in Beiping. She learned painting from Mr. Xiao Qianzhong, Xiao Wuyuan, Tang Dingzhi, Chen Banding, and Wang Mengbai in her childhood. Her brushstrokes are bold and unrestrained, recently drawing on the essence of Bai Shi and Wu Lao, and remotely drawing on the charm of Shi Tao and Bada, and also adding the humor of Bai Yang and Tianchi. There is no feminine air in her works. She has traveled extensively in the north and south provinces, and has a reputation wherever she goes. Although there are many female painters in Shanghai, there are few who can pass on the style of Wu Lao in freehand flowers and plants. The colors and ink are dripping, and the brush is as fast as wind and rain, which can make the viewers excited and excited. She is gentle and elegant, and polite, and is worthy of being a typical female in Beiping.

Some people say: "Painting is like the person." After seeing the paintings of the two, this sentence is probably not very applicable.

### Lotus (One of the Exhibits in the Centennial Painting Exhibition)

Ren Yu, also known as Lifan, was from Xiaoshan. He inherited the family learning of his father, Weichang, and his flowers and birds were very similar to his father, while his landscapes opened up new paths. However, he was of a sparse and casual nature, living a life of wanderer in Shanghai, and whenever he was in a difficult situation, if someone came with money, he would immediately paint for them, otherwise he would not respond. This painting is a work of the late years of Baiyang Shanren, with elegant brushstrokes, made casually, with a deep interest in plainness, and the ink and color are moist and elegant, very similar to Bai Chang.

### Thoughts on the Preview of Dai Qiren's National Painting Exhibition

— Liu Shuyou

Shanghai is a place where talent gathers, encompassing all sorts of wonders. Some compare it to the "Paris of the East," and indeed, that is not far from the truth. There are also particularly more art exhibitions held in Shanghai than in other cities. Among these diverse exhibitions, some are speculative merchants passing off imitations for business gain, some are "begging for contributions" by relying on their political connections, and some are exhibiting genuine achievements in artistic cultivation. However, the former two types constitute the majority, which clearly shows the decline of social culture and the sluggishness of the social economy. Mr. Dai Qiren's painting exhibition had a preview yesterday at the New Life Club and is officially opening today for a two-day public exhibition. People in Shanghai can see the style of this painter who has just come from the rear. My impression and feelings from today's preview are as follows: This painter's style can be said to be entirely for art's sake, creating as an artist entirely for art's sake, burying himself in hard work. His flowers and birds, at the very least, are free from the air of commercialism and the stench of the mundane. Although his painting methods are derived from the ancients, there is no place where he is confined by the old methods of the ancients. In every painting, one can see that he is creating, he is sketching from life. Although creating and sketching from life, his every brushstroke is particularly imbued with ancient charm. Each flower and tree, each branch and leaf, is carefully managed and boldly painted. A kind of simple and profound quality, and a magnificent spirit, overflows onto the paper and hides beneath the ink. For example, in the exhibited works of peony, peony, sunflower, red plum, etc., none are without the elegance of color and ink, and the strength of the brush. The willow warblers, flocks of pigeons, roosters, eagles, and egrets that he paints all conform to natural sentiments and reason, without relying on fiction. Their flight and rest, the chirping of sparrows and the cries of cranes, are all lifelike. As the saying goes, "Responding to objects and depicting their forms, conveying their colors according to their kind," he deeply understands the Six Principles of ancient painting. As for those who often depict flying horses in the sky and swimming dragons in the sea, Mr. Dai does not adopt those. Nor does he emulate those who splash ink and smear dan, being crude and wild, thinking themselves innovative and superior, and then criticizing society for lacking the ability to appreciate, boasting about their own uniqueness. As for those erotic works such as "Consort Yang emerging from the bath" and "Raising Hell in the Grape Arbor," which are charming and moving, and single-mindedly catering to society's degraded psychology, Mr. Dai does not even consider them. Although I don’t dare to say that Mr. Dai's exhibition sweeps away the trend of frivolity, at least it can serve as a lesson for those who are superficial and shallow.

### An Inch of Mountain, an Inch of River, an Inch of White

— Ye Dongfeng

As Yaoqun stepped out of the gate, she paused slightly, then crossed to the opposite side of the street. She strolled back and forth in front of a row of shops, as if she wanted to buy something but couldn't make up her mind. In reality, she was assessing the situation of the restaurant across the street, looking for a suitable place to leave a secret mark for Little Tiger. Among several suitable locations, she settled on a grayish-white brick, about four or five inches square, on the lower left corner of the "China Restaurant" signboard. The surroundings were all obscured, but it perfectly met the conditions for installing a secret mark.

What exactly was this "secret mark"? Because in the old stronghold, small teams often set out to fight guerrillas two or three hundred li away. These small teams of dozens of people could, of course, travel together in the mountains and fields, but sometimes they had to pass through towns and busy cities to stop. With so many people, it was unavoidable to draw attention, so before entering the city, the small team would break up into twos and threes, each finding a place to stay. However, they were afraid of losing contact, so each group's lodging location had a secret mark; their own people could recognize it at a glance. This was somewhat similar to the "notes" used by secret societies all over the country, using red or yellow paper with inexplicable words or phrases like "...Da Ta Descends Altar..." and pasting them diagonally on walls along the way. Those in the know could tell the direction and location of the meeting by the angle.

But the secret marks of the old stronghold, after Yaoqun's improvement, became very hidden and concise. Outsiders would absolutely not be able to discover them easily, but their own people, upon seeing them, would not only understand that comrades from the stronghold were staying there, but also their rank and name. For example, Yaoqun was the captain of the seventh team, so her secret mark was the number "7". The location for leaving this mark was only at the corners of houses, the left and right sides of door frames, around the signboard, etc. However, the location had to have obscuring colors, patterns, or traces on all sides to avoid attracting the attention of outsiders. The tool for making this mark was not fixed; sometimes white chalk, sometimes black lead or other colored items, and sometimes just a small knife or awl for carving. As for the rank, the one marking the very center of the location was definitely the captain, the upper two corners were for squad leaders, and the lower two corners were for team members. But when leaving, the secret mark had to be removed.

This type of secret marking was quite easy to use outside the customs, but it was not as complex and complete as the secret marks of Bai Ren Village (see The Sword Master of the Sea House), which could express the task, direction, time, and meaning, and the lead powder used was mixed with luminous substances like phosphorus and radium, so it was faintly visible even in the dark of night; after a certain amount of time, it could also dissipate and disappear on its own. This, of course, had a much greater effect than the method used by Yaoqun.

Yaoqun did not really need to make any secret mark here, because in the "French Concession" area, there were basically only a few lodges where one could stay, such as Dahua, Yuzhong, Guomin, etc. Other older styles without bedding, such as Weifa, Changchun, etc., seven or eight in total, would certainly not be chosen. Moreover, seeing Yaoqun's number "7" was also a clear indicator; room numbers 7, 17, 27 (6 and 8 also included), etc., as long as there was a "7", and the list of other guests had Miss Ji, wouldn't it be very obvious? Why would she need to put a secret mark outside the door? Under this clear and bright sky, with everything so obvious, doing this would not only be dangerous, but no matter how clever and alert Yaoqun was, it would add a lot of trouble.

However, this step, for the sake of Little Tiger, could not be omitted. Just thinking that the information Little Tiger was going to retrieve might be time-sensitive, or a secret operation that required seizing the moment, and these four or five suitable lodges were not lined up on the same street, calling him to run back and forth a long way, searching one lodge at a time, would not only be exhausting but might also delay important matters. Therefore, under the condition of "weighing the two evils and choosing the lesser," Yaoqun was willing to make things a little more difficult for herself.

### New Wood Products

— Tang Yao

Wood is an important organic raw material. In recent years, its application in aeronautical engineering has achieved surprising results. Through modern technological processing, the mechanical strength and stability of several refined wood products can be compared to mild steel. Impregnated paper, a kind of refined wood product, has tensile strength and lightness exceeding that of the light metal aluminum. In the United States, factories producing over ten thousand gallons of industrial alcohol annually from wood chips and waste have been established. The use of wood as a raw material for manufacturing plastics is also gradually increasing. Therefore, it is no wonder that Americans view their Forest Products Laboratory as the world's greatest magician, or call wood a magical raw material. I have previously introduced several new American wood products, such as urea-plasticized wood (Urea-Plasticized Wood or Uralloy), anti-shrink wood (Impreg), compressed wood (Compreg), lignin plastics, and paper-based plastics (Papreg). (See Sea King, Vol. 17, Nos. 11 and 20). Here, I intend to review the new technologies and important inventions related to wood in the past thirty years, in order to gain a glimpse into the amazing contributions of wood in recent years. If this can further promote the modernization of forest product utilization, it would be my humble intention.

At the beginning of this century, the world had no way to control the drying of wood. When the European War broke out, the United States needed a large amount of dried wood to manufacture aircraft. Mr. Tiemann, an American, pioneered a water-spray kiln that could control relative humidity, allowing wood to dry in a short time with minimal warping. As a result, a large amount of aircraft material was supplied, marking the beginning of artificial drying of wood. This is one. Wood has quite different properties in the axial and transverse directions; therefore, the manufacture of fuselages and wings mostly uses thin sheets of wood with overlapping grains, glued together. This technology also made considerable progress during the First European War, truly opening up the research and manufacture of synthetic resins, and is closely related to modern refined wood products. This is the second.

Germany has made significant achievements in improving the use of wood fibers, enhancing the properties of wood, and solving problems in clothing and food through its knowledge of wood chemistry and applied chemical engineering. Several kinds of refined wood, such as Bakelisiertes Holz, Ligno tone, Panzerhloz, and Metalholz, differ in importance, but it is commendable that they use scientific and industrial technology to compensate for the shortcomings of wood and increase its utilization. In the UK, impregnated laminated, compressed wood is also used in aircraft manufacture. However, the US Forest Products Laboratory is the giant in terms of technological contributions to wood. Here are some of its most important contributions:

(1) Preventing Wood Shrinkage: In 1937, Mr. A.J. Stamm, a chemical expert at the US Forest Products Laboratory, devoted himself to research on the colloidal chemistry of wood, aiming to synthesize artificial resins within the submicroscopic structure of wood cell walls, in order to make the wood itself lose the ability to expand and contract. This is the basic principle of research on anti-shrinkage of wood.

(2) Wood-Based Plastics: Mr. E.E. Harris, an expert in lignin at the US Forest Products Laboratory, made plastics from wood chips seven or eight years ago. His method was to place wood chips in a digester and first subject them to mild hydrolysis. The steam pressure used was usually 135-200 pounds per square inch. After washing and filtering, the chips were ground into powder and made into plastics. Experiments were conducted by adding 25% phenol resin to 75% hydrolyzed wood and pressing it at a temperature of 300 degrees Fahrenheit and a pressure of 3000-4000 pounds per square inch. In recent years, through technical improvements, it has been possible to mold huge objects for engineering applications. This kind of finished product has excellent water resistance, acid resistance, and insulation properties, with a bending strength of 8000-13000 pounds per square inch and absorbing only 0.2-0.3% of moisture after being immersed in water for 48 hours.

(3) Chemical Seasoning: Mr. W.K. Loughborough, a wood drying expert at the US Forest Products Laboratory, observed that when wood is dried, the surface is often dry while the interior is still wet. According to his research, if the moisture in the wood can be dried from the inside out, gradually reaching the surface, many defects caused by improper drying can be avoided. He immersed the wood to be dried in appropriate chemicals, such as salt, penetrating the wood on all sides, preventing the exterior from drying in the early stages of drying, and allowing the moisture inside to slowly move to the surface. This has significantly improved the drying of swamp oak, which is very difficult to dry. (To be continued)

### Artificial Ice-Free Ports

— Ge Ming

Two Swedish scientists—B.O. Persson and E. Forsland—have come up with a way to keep northern ports ice-free all year round, allowing navigation. Their method is to immerse many open pipes underwater in the port, through which a liquid flows from a compressor and pipeline on shore. Warmer water rises from below, melting the ice on the surface or preventing the upper layer from solidifying into ice. The openings of the pipes immersed underwater are curved into arcs, so the hot water released will form waves, spreading in all directions to prevent large areas from freezing. In addition, this newly invented design can also be used to keep the water around hydroelectric power stations and rivers used for transporting wood ice-free.

### Electric Lamp Beetles

— Yu

In the tropical regions of the Americas, there is a beetle that is about one and a half inches long. On both sides of its chest, there are transparent, window-like parts, about the size of bullets, which are the source of bright light.

The light it emits does not flicker like a firefly, but can continue for more than five minutes almost every time, so it seems as if it is always shining and never goes out.

The natives there put these beetles in small boxes as a substitute for flashlights. They can walk in the dark just like with a flashlight.

### Human Life in the Arctic

— Song Liwu

Human activity is greatly influenced by the natural environment. Climate is the most basic element of the natural environment and is closely related to human life. The Antarctic continent, covered in ice and snow, is sparsely populated. Except for the area near the North Pole, which has not been fully explored because no expeditions have ventured there, the Eurasian and North American continents and islands north of 60 degrees north latitude have long been inhabited by humans. The Eskimos of Greenland have a long history, with a current population of about 20,000. The Siberians and Lapps live on the mainland and islands of the Eastern Hemisphere. In recent years, islands in the Arctic Ocean have become the target of competition among various countries, and workers have been flocking there. The United States, the Soviet Union, and other countries have established many Arctic research stations, and have advanced to 82 degrees north latitude. Therefore, the climatic conditions of the Arctic, with a little artificial equipment, are not enough to limit human health and excitement. Various pathogens and vectors of infectious diseases are not easy to grow and develop, so tropical epidemic diseases such as typhoid fever, dysentery, cholera, black fever, and malaria are extremely rare. Respiratory infectious diseases such as influenza, pneumonia, meningitis, measles, smallpox, diphtheria, and scarlet fever are also less common than in the winter of temperate zones. Moreover, the low temperature makes it easier to preserve objects for a longer time. For example, the Soviet Rudolf Island depot sealed the island's houses, armories, food reserves, fuel, and clothing in 1942. When personnel returned there again in May of this year, after five years, the stored materials were still in good condition.

However, certain conditions in the Arctic environment still greatly affect human health. For example, the half-year-long nights in winter have very weak light, with no direct sunlight, lacking ultraviolet rays. All activities are restricted, and physical health is also affected. Arctic plants are not easy to grow, and the local area lacks fresh plant-based foods and fruits. The supply of nutritional vitamins is cut off, so scurvy is very common among residents of the extremely cold zone, and their faces are pale, especially during the winter nights. Therefore, expedition teams or research station personnel must not only prepare canned food and pickled fish and meat, but also frequently airlift fresh fruits and vegetables to supply the workers (Eskimos can avoid this disease because they often eat semi-cooked or raw animal meat, blood, and seafood). Humans who have lived in the polar regions for a long time have very low resistance to infectious diseases, so once external pathogens are introduced, epidemics easily spread. For example, since the Eskimos have interacted with humans in civilized societies, their physical condition has gradually weakened, and their population is not as large as it used to be. The reason is this. In addition, frostbite should be prevented at all times, especially systemic frostbite under extremely low temperatures. Localized frostbite (such as on the hands, feet, and face) is easier to treat and less serious. People with poor health (such as anemia, heart weakness, and malnutrition) and those who are addicted to alcohol should not be sent to work in the Arctic, because alcohol dilates blood vessels, and internal heat is easily dissipated, making it difficult to maintain body temperature. When working outdoors, the strong reflection of light by ice and snow can easily damage eyesight, so amber-colored glasses must be worn at all times to prevent this.

### Sweet, Sour, Bitter, Salty

— Zhao Nan

In ancient China, sweet, sour, bitter, salty, and pungent were classified as the five tastes. However, recent scientific research has proven that pungency is a type of stimulation, a sensation of the skin. Therefore, the tastes currently recognized by physiologists and psychologists are only sweet, sour, bitter, and salty. All other tastes are formed by the combination of these four main tastes.

Sugar is sweet, vinegar is sour, Coptis chinensis is bitter, and salt is salty. What is the principle by which our tongues can distinguish them one by one? The physiological function of this taste is actually a chemical action. Therefore, taste has a certain relationship to the chemical composition of substances. The sweetness of sucrose is due to the presence of eight hydroxyl groups in its molecule; and the strength of the sweetness of alcohols and their derivatives in all organic compounds is also determined by the number of hydroxyl groups in their constituent molecules. Similarly, sourness is due to hydrogen ions, and saltiness is due to the molecules of sodium chloride itself.

Concentration and temperature have significant effects on taste. Taking sweetness as an example, the sweetness that can be perceived at room temperature is a 0.1% solution, but at zero degrees, a 0.4% solution is required. At the same time, the highest temperature at which we can perceive sweetness is 52 degrees Celsius, and it becomes difficult to distinguish beyond that. As for salt, it must weigh more than 0.007 grams for us to be able to feel it.

The sensitivity of our tongues to taste is different in different parts. Generally, the back half of the tongue near the taste organs is the most sensitive, followed by the edge and tip of the tongue. This physiologically mysterious structure unconsciously prompts us to swallow our favorite foods. The reaction speed of the tongue to tastes is also different in different parts; the back of the tongue generally reacts faster than the tip of the tongue. Our reaction to bitterness is generally slower than to sweetness, and the residual effect is stronger. Therefore, when you take bitter medicine mixed with sugar, you will first feel the sweetness, and then the bitterness. By the time the sweetness has gone, the bitterness still remains.

When salty and sweet tastes are used at the same time, they will mutually cancel each other out or even strengthen each other. For example, if you mix sugar and salt in an appropriate ratio and then dissolve them in water, if it is very dilute, there will be no special taste; if it is very concentrated, not only will the two tastes not do anything special, but they will also have a dull salty taste. This phenomenon is very interesting, and readers may want to try it.

Scientific Book Review

### POTASH SODA PROCESS

— Wang Qiande

Although this book is written in English, and the entire book has only fifty pages besides the preface and table of contents, on the surface it seems like it has no value for introduction, but this is not the case. Because the author in this book only writes about the new method of manufacturing soda ash (also known as washing soda, Sodium Carbonate) from potash, which has been patented. However, the author is unwilling to keep it secret and has sincerely and frankly written it out, which can not only provide a reference for people in the chemical industry, but also can be said to be a new development in China's alkali manufacturing industry.

The main point of this book is that the author introduces the new method for manufacturing soda ash that he invented, and the equipment for manufacturing alkali according to the new method, etc. In the past, there were only three methods for manufacturing pure alkali: the Leblanc Process, the Solvay Process, and the Electrolytic Process. The main raw material of the Leblanc Process is mirabilite, which was previously mainly obtained as a by-product of manufacturing hydrochloric acid. However, now most hydrochloric acid is manufactured by direct synthesis (which is no less advanced even in China), so the Leblanc Process has become obsolete. The main raw material of the Solvay Process is ammonia gas. Although this raw material is quite cheap in European and American countries, the situation is different in China. The price of ammonia is quite expensive, and there are very few factories specializing in its manufacture, so it is very clear that the Solvay Process is not suitable for China. Finally, regarding the electrolytic method, it is even less suitable for China, because the main alkali product of the electrolytic method is not pure alkali but sodium hydroxide. Then, sodium hydroxide solution is used to pass in carbon dioxide gas to produce pure alkali. I think there may be no one in China willing to do this! Because the value of sodium hydroxide is several times more expensive than pure alkali from the start.

But the author's new method is completely different. It can indeed meet all the realistic conditions in China. Its raw materials are the most common potash and table salt. The main source of potash is extracted from grass ash, grain ash, wood ash, or tung husk ash, which are discarded or considered garbage by people. Although table salt is more expensive than raw materials such as grass ash, etc., which are considered waste, it is not too alarming.

The interaction of potash solution and salt brine produces crystals of soda ash and potassium chloride. Then, the author's proposed method of Chilling Process separates the soda ash crystals from potassium oxide at low temperatures. After washing with cold water, centrifuging, and recrystallizing, extremely pure soda ash, which is the so-called washing soda, is obtained.

Or, before the mixture of soda ash and potassium chloride is separated, carbon dioxide gas is passed in to convert all the soda ash in the solution into sodium bicarbonate and precipitate it. The precipitated sodium bicarbonate is filtered out and then strongly heated to release the originally absorbed carbon dioxide, becoming very high-quality soda ash. This is also one of the author's methods, the Carbonating Process. This method can not only produce very high-quality soda ash, but also manufacture very pure sodium bicarbonate.

In the last chapter of the book, the author also wrote many methods for manufacturing sodium hydroxide, which are very valuable and not easily found in ordinary textbooks and magazines.

The writing technique can also be said to be well-organized and not at all chaotic. Each chapter begins with some theoretical discussions, followed by the actual working conditions, so that readers will not have a feeling of blindly following without a basis. However, what is lacking is diagrams.

We admire the author's unselfish scientific spirit. His contribution—Potash Sode Process—will have a far-reaching impact on the development of China's chemical industry.

### Reader's Mailbox A Student Apprentice Drifting Alone in a Foreign Land

Mr. Editor: I am very sorry, today I have taken the liberty of writing this letter to you. I hope you can spare a few minutes from your busy schedule to read it and not throw it into the wastepaper basket. I came to Shanghai only four days ago. Before that, I was an apprentice at a sundries store in Changshu. This was the "future" my father chose for me two years ago. In fact, my family was not poor at that time. My father was a "landlord" with more than a hundred acres of land, and the family's financial situation was sufficient for me to continue my studies. However, my father was a true "mercantilist." He believed that studying was useless and that doing business was better, so I was sent to work as an apprentice in a grocery store. I endured it for two whole years. If I had endured another year and a half, I would have "graduated," but I was unwilling to do so. I wanted to pursue my own future. I have my own wishes, I have my own ambitions.

Encouraged by a beautiful vision, I resolutely realized my drifting life. After coming to Shanghai, I lived in the home of a childhood friend. He is very poor and of course cannot give me much help. Every day, I rely on pancakes and fried dough sticks to maintain my life. Since I have come to Shanghai, my only purpose is to continue my studies. However, given my situation, there is absolutely no possibility of entering the school gate. I hope to get help from a "scholarship." In the first two days of arriving in Shanghai, I visited more than a dozen schools in a row, but in the end, I was blocked out of the gates by "academic qualifications," "certificates," "diplomas," and so on. And the ten yuan I brought with me is almost used up. In this vast sea of people in Shanghai, how can I survive the long days to come? I have decided not to go home. I hope to find some work in Shanghai to maintain my life and continue my studies in my spare time. I beg you to give me a clear indication and hope you can give me effective assistance. With best wishes for your well-being, Respectfully, Xiaosheng. Reply to be published tomorrow.
