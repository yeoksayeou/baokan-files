### Northeast Brews Decisive Battle: Fierce Fighting Intensifies Around Changchun; Three Bandit Divisions Crushed Near Changtu

[Our newspaper, Shenyang, 5th dispatch] The war situation in the Northeast has been relatively quiet in the past 24 hours, perhaps a brief respite before a major battle.

The Chairman wore a cyan long robe, a black formal dress woolen vest, a black-brimmed gray top hat, black leather shoes, and carried a cane. He looked relaxed as he gazed at the lake. Mrs. Chiang wore a black-bottomed blue flower cheongsam with a light brown毛背心. She frequently talked to female students along the way and looked very happy. The Chairman and his wife left the city at 12:15 PM, accompanied by Yu Jishi and more than ten guards. There were no guards along the eighteen-li route from Xizhimen to the Summer Palace. Farmers and farmers' wives continued their farming without interruption because they did not know that the car traveling on the road was carrying Chairman and Mrs. Chiang. At 12:55 PM, they arrived at the Summer Palace. Mayor He, along with his French wife and Xu Xinyuan, director of the Summer Palace Office, greeted them respectfully at the entrance. The Chairman and his wife got out of the car and walked hand in hand into the garden, passing southwest of the tomb of Yelü Chucai. Along the way, Mrs. Chiang frequently spoke with Mayor He's wife in French. At the Bronze Bull, the Chairman stopped and looked at it for a long time. Then he went to the Eight-Sided Pavilion. The Chairman walked around and asked Xu Xinyuan in detail about the history of the Eight-Sided Pavilion. At this time, the wife was talking to several female students visiting the garden. The Chairman also asked gently, "Which school are you from?" The girl's face turned red and she looked quite embarrassed. She replied, "I am from the Normal School." After passing the Seventeen-Arch Bridge and arriving at the Dragon King Temple, the Chairman and his wife rested briefly and then went down to the boat to inspect the Dragon King Temple. Then they went ashore and had lunch with Mayor He and his wife at the Yuebingtai Minghu Restaurant. After the meal, they took a boat across Kunming Lake to the Stone Boat. Here, they overlooked the lake and mountains on the Stone Boat, which is a representative work of the Summer Palace. Then, they walked to the Cloud-Dispelling Hall.

[This city report] Spokespersons for the Democratic Socialist Party and the Youth Party yesterday issued written statements on the parties' participation in local assemblies and the nomination of candidates for general elections, stating that participating in local popular opinion institutions by means of selection is not illegal.

(For the content of the written statements from the Democratic Socialist and Youth Parties, see the seventh column on page two.)

### Xinjiang Province Commissioner Elections; Only Kashgar Region Has Not Yet Been Held

[Central News Agency, Dihua, 4th dispatch] The Xinjiang Provincial Government Propaganda Committee held a press conference on the 4th, hosted by Chairman Liu Mengchun, answering inquiries, stating that Usmani is the Commissioner of Altai appointed by the government. The government's attitude towards him is no different from its attitude towards commissioners in other regions. Not a single soldier from the National Army followed Usmani into Altai. The government deeply sympathizes with the suffering of the people of Altai, who have been in war for seven or eight years, and is considering a third round of relief. Regarding the election of commissioners throughout Xinjiang, elections have already been held in the five districts of Aksu, Yanqi, Shache, Hotan, and Dihua. Elections will be held in the Hami district in the short term. Only in the Kashgar district, because malpractices have occurred in the elections of county magistrates and county councilors, can the commissioner election be held only after the county elections are completed, which will require considerable time.

### Promoting Good Neighborliness; Sino-Mongolian Border Tranquil; Rumor Fu Zuoyi Says Yulin is Also Peaceful

[Our newspaper, Beiping, 5th dispatch] The northern border line of Inner Mongolia is peaceful and uneventful. It is rumored that Fu Zuoyi said that the reports of recent intrusions by the Outer Mongolian army are inaccurate. He is promoting a policy of good neighborliness on the border line. Last year, he issued a notice that no matter whether they are Han or Mongolian soldiers and civilians, they are not allowed to carry weapons when traveling to and from the northern border line. If any soldiers or civilians from Outer Mongolia cross the border, they will only be escorted out of the country and will not be punished.

[Our newspaper, Beiping, 5th dispatch] Fu Zuoyi said after inspecting Yulin that Yulin is currently peaceful, but since the Communist bandit base in northern Shaanxi moved to Jia County, Yulin should be more vigilant. In early August, the Communist bandits attacked Yulin with all their strength, suffering more than 10,000 casualties. It is not known whether they have any intention of attacking Yulin again recently. According to senior generals from Yulin who came to Beiping, the outposts outside Yulin have been recovered one after another. Although the strength of the National Army is thin, their morale is extremely high. Shenmu has always been firmly defended by the National Army, but Gaojiazhai is in the hands of the bandit army, so there is still a sense of threat. The National Army in Ningxia is currently in the Sanbian area. In the battle of Yulin a month ago, the bandit army broke in twice. The fierceness of the battle can be compared to the Battle of Longtan. The bandit army is well-equipped. In addition to mountain guns, mortar, and flat-trajectory guns, there are also Soviet-style machine guns, and the sound of artillery fire can be clearly heard.

### Distinguished Guests Fly in from Ten Thousand Miles Across the Sea; The Capital Welcomes the British Delegation to China

Beiping, Shenyang, Tianjin, Qingdao, Shanghai, Tamsui, Hankou, Chongqing, and Guangzhou will also share the friendship and goodwill they bring from the British Isles in the coming month. Recalling the first British Parliamentary Delegation to China, which visited Chongqing, China's wartime capital, on November 10, 1942, it opened a new page in the history of Sino-British relations and laid the foundation for Sino-British joint operations, which achieved brilliant victories. At that time, Chairman Chiang said when welcoming the delegation: "You have taken the trouble of a long journey to visit our country, bringing us the friendship of the great British nation, and will understand the Chinese people's expectations for the people of your country in the future, thereby strengthening the alliance between our two countries in the same boat through thick and thin.". Subsequently, on December 3, 1943, our country's delegation to Britain was invited to visit Britain, further promoting understanding and cooperation between the two countries. Borrowing the words of the British Foreign Minister Wendeng at the time: "Our two peoples have many things in common, and these many, many unlimited commonalities will further promote our cooperation in the important years to come." It also explains the achievements of our country's delegation to Britain. (The itinerary of the delegation to China is in the sixth column on page two)

### Formal Announcement from the Control Yuan: Report on Foreign Exchange Usage

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 5th] The Control Yuan formally announced on the 5th a "Report on Foreign Exchange Usage and Business Reporting of Various Companies," exceeding 15,000 characters. This report provides a detailed and factual account of the use of foreign exchange in our country and the operation of major companies engaged in import and export trade, which has been the focus of national attention, from August 19, 1945, to the end of August this year. According to reports in domestic and foreign newspapers around March of this year, there were continuous reports of "government-run commercial enterprises," such as Yitong Company, Fuzhong Company, and China Construction Bank Company, taking advantage of "privileges" to settle and purchase large amounts of foreign exchange and import large quantities of prohibited goods. This aroused dissatisfaction from Chinese and foreign merchants and criticism from various parties. Subsequently, the Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang and the Central Supervisory Committee sent letters to the Control Yuan requesting a thorough investigation. The Control Yuan dispatched supervisory committee members Du Guang, He Hanwen, Gu Fengxiang, Wang Guanwu, auditor Wan Bin from the Auditing Department, and co-auditor Chen Huayuan to investigate relevant agencies and companies in Nanjing, Shanghai, and other places. After spending more than twenty days, the investigation was largely completed, and a report was drafted and submitted to the Yuan. The Yuan has forwarded the report to the National Government for review. The report first traces the evolution of the government's foreign exchange control and institutions from August 19, 1945, to August 17, 1947. It then reports the amount of foreign exchange used in each period, calculated as follows: From August 19, 1945, to March 3, 1946: US$64,200,845.95 (combined value of various foreign currencies). From March 4, 1946, to February 15, 1947: US$401,663,501.93, £17,635,564, HK$27,874,769.13. From February 16, 1947, to August 30 of the same year: US$150 million.
     Settlement of Foreign Exchange and Business Operations of the Three Companies

The report then individually presents and exposes the circumstances of major public companies settling foreign exchange and engaging in import and export trade. The Fuzhong Company settled US$1,585,086.09, with a foreign exchange income of US$137,817.43, but nearly half of the imported materials were automobiles. It was also noted that the company's responsibilities with its New York branch were unclear, which caused much concern. The Yangzi Company had settled US$2,820,411.03, £21,041, and Swiss Francs 45,333. The unsettled foreign exchange was US$903,684.72 and £1,386. Although most of its imported materials were cotton and medicines, the nominally separate relationship between the company and the American Yangtze Trading Company needs further investigation. The China Construction Bank Company settled foreign exchange of US$877.62, which was indeed used to purchase daily office supplies, and there was no waste of large amounts of foreign exchange. However, an interesting piece of news revealed in the report is that the company's operating loss for the period reached National Currency $142,700,178. Song Ziwen's nominal investment was valued at $250,000 in pre-war currency. Furthermore, the report pointed out that responsible personnel of the above-mentioned companies used diplomatic passports to engage in trade activities in the United States, listing Song Ziliang, general manager of Fuzhong Company, who used the title of special envoy for transportation investigation; Shen Henian, assistant manager of the company, who used the title of accompanying secretary of former Foreign Minister Song; and Song Zi'an, general manager of China Construction Bank Company, who used the title of attendant secretary of the Military Affairs Commission's attendant office, all of whom went abroad one after another and have not yet returned.

Eight Conclusions and Recommendations Provide Basis for Punishment

After detailing the above-mentioned investigation results, this lengthy report puts forward the following eight conclusions and recommendations to provide the government with a basis for punishment and a reference for selection: The government originally had 6 million ounces of gold and US$900 million in reserves, but most of it was consumed in the import of non-construction materials within two years. Since the currency system has not been reformed and prices have not been stabilized, former President Song Ziwen should be held responsible for the inappropriate measures taken. The foreign exchange control agencies and methods have been changed frequently, leaving the people at a loss. In the future, more comprehensive decisions should be made. In the future, imports should expand daily necessities and strictly prohibit consumer goods. The criticisms from foreign countries regarding our import and export trade methods may be due to a lack of understanding of the facts or malicious exaggeration. Based on actual investigations, the so-called exclusion of foreign merchants is unfounded. Industrial and commercial enterprises and individuals should not participate in the Central Supreme Economic Decision-Making Authority, as this could lead to the leakage of national policies. The Ministry of Finance should investigate and deal with the Traffic, Jin Cheng, and China National Goods Banks separately for investing in and operating the China Construction Bank Company, which violates banking regulations. The passports of responsible persons of major companies who engage in trade activities abroad under false pretenses should be revoked. Imported materials that have not been approved for import but have already arrived at the port should be processed promptly. (The full text of the report can be found on page 2, section 1.)

According to reports, the Chinese delegation has proposed to the United Nations General Assembly: "Whenever international disputes are being resolved, the Security Council should automatically waive its veto power, but it does not advocate amending the United Nations Charter, but only requests that the nature of the automatic waiver of veto power be clarified." According to a Central News Agency dispatch, the Chinese proposal is expected to be opposed by the Soviet Union, as the Soviet Union firmly refuses to consider "unauthorized changes" to the Security Council's veto power. The representatives of the other three powers have not yet made any formal comments. The arrival of this news seems somewhat contradictory to our country's request to reserve veto power over the Treaty of Peace with Japan. Our country's advocacy of retaining veto power over the Treaty of Peace with Japan seems to be closer to the Soviet Union's viewpoint, while the proposal submitted to the General Assembly to limit the scope of the use of veto power is contrary to the Soviet Union's policy. Therefore, some political commentators believe that our country does not have a clear foreign policy. We believe that at this time, it is indeed necessary to briefly clarify our country's foreign policy.

First of all, we must point out that the reservation of veto power over the Treaty of Peace with Japan and the restriction on the use of veto power in the General Assembly and Security Council are fundamentally two different matters. The drafting of the Treaty of Peace with Japan is not within the purview of the United Nations organization. Therefore, the reservation of veto power over the Treaty of Peace with Japan and the restriction on the use of veto power in the General Assembly and Security Council cannot be confused. Regarding the Treaty of Peace with Japan, the National Political Council and the Foreign Ministry's Treaty of Peace with Japan Review Committee have both given careful consideration and believe that the Soviet Union must participate in the Treaty of Peace with Japan, and the four powers in the peace conference must retain veto power. Because China and Japan are geographically close and have suffered from the aggression of Japanese warlords for a long time, causing severe harm, in order to ensure its own safety, it cannot allow the resurgence of Japanese aggression. Therefore, it is particularly concerned about the Treaty of Peace with Japan. Furthermore, there are still many issues to be resolved between China and the Soviet Union, so the Soviet Union cannot be excluded from the treaty. Although China's decision-making on the Treaty of Peace with Japan may outwardly resemble that of the Soviet Union, it is entirely based on an independent position, and its significance may not be the same as that of the Soviet Union. As for the issue of veto power, Premier Zhang stated at the Fourth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang Central Committee on September 9 this year: "China believes that the charter should not be fundamentally amended to abolish veto power, but it believes that a reasonable interpretation should be established to restrict its abuse." Foreign Minister Wang, in his statement before attending the United Nations General Assembly in the United States, also pointed out regarding the issue of veto power in the United Nations Security Council: "My government believes that the solution to such an important issue lies in establishing a general and reasonable interpretation of the veto power stipulated in the Charter through agreement among all parties, rather than in the amendment of the Charter itself, and amending the Charter is currently unlikely to be realized." It can be seen that our country does not advocate amending the United Nations Charter, but adopts restrictions on the use of veto power in the Security Council, which has always been a consistent policy. What we want to particularly point out here is that the restriction on the use of veto power in the Security Council and the abolition of veto power in the Security Council are two different things. What we advocate is that the use of veto power by powerful countries in the Security Council should be restricted to prevent its abuse; this does not mean that we advocate abolishing the veto power system in the Security Council, nor does it mean that we advocate abandoning the use of veto power in the Security Council. This is a very important point.

Speaking of our foreign policy, it has its own consistent principles and firm stance. It can be summarized into four characters, which are: impartiality, righteousness, and peace. Foreign Minister Wang pointed out at the Chongqing National Political Council session in February last year, our foreign policy: "To do our best to enhance the unity of the United Nations, especially the unity of the major powers. To achieve this goal, first, we do not follow the traditional diplomatic strategy of allying with any one country or group to confront other countries. Second, we adhere to the position of justice in all matters, right is right, and wrong is wrong." Premier Zhang also pointed out at the Fourth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang Central Committee: "The basic requirement of China's diplomacy is to strive for world peace so that China can obtain stability and opportunities for construction; the government must strive to maintain its friendly relations with its major allies on the one hand and support the United Nations to promote cooperation among the major powers on the other hand." Because our foreign policy is impartial, righteous, and peaceful, we support the United Nations as an international organization, promote cooperation among the major powers to maintain world peace, and strive to maintain our friendly relations with our major allies. Based on this national policy, China's foreign relations are neither pro-Soviet nor pro-American, let alone anti-Soviet or anti-American, and especially not like being pro-American and anti-Soviet today and pro-Soviet and anti-American tomorrow. Recently, some American political commentators have thought that China will use a pro-Soviet stance to "intimidate" or "coerce" the United States. This argument may be due to misunderstandings caused by Vice President Sun's personal remarks, but it can also be seen that they do not yet have a correct understanding of China's foreign policy. At the same time, the Soviet Union's argument is that China is pro-American and anti-Soviet. We are willing to stand on an impartial position to seek world peace. When talking about China's foreign policy, the editorial of this newspaper once pointed out: "We are friends with all nations that are friendly to us. The Confucian tradition of China for two thousand years only knows loyalty, trustworthiness, sincerity, respect, kindness, and neighborliness..." This is our impartial position.

As for safeguarding the integrity of territory and sovereignty, this is a decision that any independent country must have, and it in itself is not enough to constitute the main body of foreign policy. In the past, because of the existence of unequal treaties, one of the purposes of our national movement was to abolish these unequal treaties to ensure the integrity of our territory and sovereignty. Therefore, at the Paris Peace Conference in 1919 and the Washington Conference in 1921, our country's efforts were directed in this direction. Currently, because the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship has not been faithfully implemented, there is still room for our continued efforts in this regard. We have always maintained the dignity of treaties, so we demand the implementation of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship. China is willing to abide by its treaty obligations, but if the Soviet Union does not comply, we will definitely argue on the basis of reason. This is the backbone of our Soviet policy. As for China's policy toward the United States, there is no need to say more that it is willing to consolidate and enhance the traditional friendship between the two countries. The United States fought alongside us during the war, and after the war, it left prisoners of war to accept surrender, which gave us a lot of help. In the future, there will be many opportunities for Sino-American cooperation in international politics, and we have no reason to be easily alienated by others. However, some American allies have quite correct views on the situation in China, which can serve as a medicine for our self-reflection and self-improvement, but regarding the difficulties China has encountered since its victory in the war, they may not fully understand them due to the exaggerated propaganda of those with ulterior motives. Therefore, China must seek mutual understanding between the two countries to strengthen its alliance of cooperation, which goes without saying. On the American side, how its China policy is, whether it will extend the spirit of the Truman Doctrine and the Marshall Plan for European aid to China, is a matter for the United States itself. After the Second World War, the American government and people will definitely be able to make choices based on experience. We do not need to make plans here that exceed our responsibilities.

### Full Text of the Supervisory Yuan Report

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 5th] The Supervisory Yuan released today the "Investigation Report on the Use of Foreign Exchange and the Business Operations of Various Companies" submitted by Supervisory Committee members Du Guangxun and others, together with Wan Rongbin and others from the Audit Department. The full text is as follows:

Since the victory of our country in the War of Resistance, foreign communication and trade relations have been restored, and after the war, everything is waiting to be rebuilt. However, the government's finances are extremely difficult, prices are rising daily, and there is currency inflation. Therefore, the foreign exchange issue has gradually become a major issue in the national economy and financial sector, attracting great attention from all parties. Not only have the financial authorities made repeated changes to the management of foreign exchange facilities, but they have also consistently kept the actual situation and figures of foreign exchange use secret, preventing the outside world from understanding. As a result, rumors abound, and criticisms are increasing daily. In early March of this year, the 223rd Standing Committee Meeting of the National Defense Supreme Committee, based on the proposal of Committee member Zhang Ji and others, resolved that "all foreign exchange cases approved by the government shall be handed over to the Supervisory Yuan to order the Audit Department to investigate in detail and report." The Yuan then ordered the Audit Department and Supervisory Committee member Du Guangxun and others to investigate. However, due to the inability to access banking records, a detailed investigation could not be conducted, resulting in a lack of comprehensive public reporting on the situation of this case. On March 13th of this year, United Press Shanghai reported: "China's state-owned enterprises recently purchased tens of thousands of U.S. dollars worth of import fees, completely ignoring the exchange restrictions and import regulations imposed on private Sino-American individuals since last November. It is understood that Yitong Company, Central Trust Bureau, and China Supplies Bureau are currently importing large quantities of 'luxury goods,' such as high-priced cars, wireless radios, iceboxes, and other items that China should avoid and strictly prohibits importing. Meanwhile, thousands of import permits and exchange requests from private businesses for urgently needed legitimate imports such as heavy industrial equipment are being ignored by the authorities." Furthermore, sources in the shipping industry confirmed that most of these luxury goods were ordered by government-related businesses for supply to private buyers, and it is rumored that they were ordered by government officials to profit from them. Chinese business figures pointed out that Yitong Company is an agent of the Central Trust Bureau, ordering foreign goods at low prices and charging a 1% commission when reselling them to private businesses. As a result, Sino-American businesses make very little profit, insufficient to cover expenses, making it difficult for them to compete with "government-run" businesses. Sino-American businessmen also voiced numerous criticisms of Fuzhong Company, supported by T.V. Soong, China Construction Bank Company of T.A. Soong, and Yangzi Construction Company of H.H. Kung, for being able to use "privileges" to engage in commerce. For example, one representative of Fuzhong Company is currently traveling commercially in the United States using a Chinese diplomat's passport, while experienced Chinese business leaders who wish to go to the United States are often unable to obtain permission. Recently, American businesses in Washington and New York have protested to the State Department about the aforementioned "privileged businesses," accusing them of using political and other pressures to exclude foreign merchants from China. While many American business leaders in China are unwilling to discuss this publicly, most also acknowledge that the situation that prompted the protest a month ago still exists and believe there is very little hope for improvement." On July 1st of this year, the New York Evening Post reprinted a dispatch from the China correspondent of the Associated Press, Ren Earl, which also contained similar criticisms of our country's import trade (see Observation, Volume 2, Issue 22). At the same time, domestic newspapers and magazines competed to publish news about the government's wasteful use of foreign exchange and the use of privileges by import and export trading companies such as Fuzhong and Yangzi to obtain foreign exchange and purchase luxury goods. The committee members were ordered to thoroughly investigate. After consulting relevant files from various Yuan and departments, and going to Shanghai to collect information, audit accounts, and seek opinions from banks, import and export trading companies, and customs, the various situations obtained from the investigation and the conclusions drawn from the analysis and research based on various materials are reported separately as follows:

First, Investigated Facts

(A) Evolution of Foreign Exchange Management Institutions

The National Government's foreign exchange management institutions have undergone numerous changes since the establishment of the Foreign Exchange Examination Department by the Central Bank in March of the 27th year [1938]. In July of the 27th year, the Foreign Exchange Department was established under the Trade Commission of the Ministry of Finance. In April of the 28th year [1939], the Ministry of Finance re-established the Foreign Exchange Examination Committee. In October of the 28th year, the Joint Treasury also established the Exchange Department. In September of the 30th year [1941], the Executive Yuan established the Foreign Exchange Management Committee and the Exchange Equalization Fund Committee. In January of the 32nd year [1943], the Foreign Exchange Management Committee was transferred to the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Finance. On April 16th of the 34th year [1945], the Foreign Exchange Management Committee was ordered to be abolished. The original functions of the committee, except for a portion that remained under the Ministry of Finance, regarding the examination of purchase applications, the handling of export exchange settlements, the control of the foreign exchange market, and the investigation and research of foreign exchange management, were all transferred to the Central Bank. Within the Bureau of Business, the Foreign Exchange Section and the Foreign Exchange Management Section were established. Regarding applications for the purchase of foreign exchange, initially, the President of the Bank, H.H. Kung, personally reviewed them. From May 14th to June 8th of the same year, Kung approved 302 foreign exchange cases via telegram from the United States, totaling US$2,690,104.93. Subsequently, a telegram was presented to the Chairman for approval to establish a Foreign Exchange Examination Committee within the Bank, which was established on June 16th of the 34th year. H.H. Kung and Yu Hongjun served as directors successively. During this period, the examination standards and approval procedures were very strict, so the amount of foreign exchange approved was also very small. After the victory of the War of Resistance, transportation was restored, and international trade was frequent. After T.V. Soong became the President of the Executive Yuan, he promulgated the Provisional Measures for Foreign Exchange Management of the Central Bank and the Provisional Measures for Import and Export Trade on March 4th of the 35th year [1946]. The Foreign Exchange Examination Department was established in the Central Bank, and 29 banks, including Guangdong Bank, were designated as designated banks to engage in foreign exchange business. For government agencies applying for foreign exchange, the Executive Yuan or the Ministry of Finance approved and notified the Central Bank to sell accordingly. All import remittances from overseas Chinese and individual applications were handled by designated banks. The weekly foreign exchange income and expenditure figures and individual applications were handled by the designated banks, who then reported the total amounts along with the applications to the Foreign Exchange Examination Department of the Central Bank. Surplus foreign exchange was sold to the Central Bank, and any shortfall was supplied by the Central Bank at the official price. At that time, international transportation was restored, and the types of imported goods restricted were very few. The Central Bank supplied the difference between foreign exchange inflows and outflows as much as possible, and the power to approve foreign exchange settlements for merchants and individuals was in fact exercised by the designated banks. The Foreign Exchange Examination Department of the Central Bank merely reviewed the weekly reports of these banks afterward. This was the most liberal period for foreign exchange use, and also the period with the highest foreign exchange expenditure (see Appendices 1 and 2). Subsequently, due to excessive imports of foreign goods, the Central Bank's unrestricted supply of foreign exchange to the market was also running low, and the difference between the official foreign exchange rate and the black market foreign exchange rate became increasingly large (see Appendix 3), the losses suffered by the country became greater. The Central Bank then promulgated revised Provisional Measures for Import and Export Trade on November 17th of the 35th year, establishing a Provisional Import Management Committee, adopting an import permit system, and implementing a prior application and examination method for foreign exchange. Import trade was thus subject to certain restrictions (see Appendix 4). By February of this year, due to the gold rush, the foreign exchange black market became even more rampant. The government then announced emergency economic measures, adopting stricter controls on foreign exchange, tightening restrictions on imported goods, and suppressing the foreign exchange black market. Thus, foreign exchange management transitioned from a situation of extreme laissez-faire to one of extreme control. The foreign exchange expenditure has been greatly reduced compared to the amount of foreign exchange used from March 4th to November 17th of the 35th year. However, because the government limited the price of foreign exchange to a fixed official price of 12,000, while the black market flourished, overseas remittances and other foreign exchange income decreased daily, and foreign trade could not be conducted. The foreign exchange held by the government decreased daily, so on August 17th of this year, a method was announced to determine the market price of foreign exchange on a daily basis, in addition to the fixed official price of 12,000, in order to thoroughly eliminate the foreign exchange black market and increase foreign exchange income. Furthermore, on August 18th, the permission to import all goods with self-provided foreign exchange was suspended in order to make even more stringent restrictions. This is a general overview of our government's foreign exchange management since the War of Resistance.

(B) Foreign Exchange Usage

The procedures and situation of foreign exchange usage during the above periods: (1) From August 19th of the 34th year [1945] to March 3rd of the 35th year, was the period of the Central Bank's Foreign Exchange Examination Committee. The standards and regulations for its examination were the Measures for Individuals Applying to Purchase Foreign Exchange, the Measures for Insurance Businesses Applying to Purchase Foreign Exchange, the Measures for Government Agencies and Business Agencies Applying to Purchase Foreign Exchange, and the Measures for Wartime Industrial and Commercial Businesses Purchasing Foreign Exchange. At that time, restrictions were very strict, and transportation was also extremely difficult. Except for cases specially approved by the Chairman and cases approved by the Ministry of Finance and then submitted to the committee for retroactive approval, individual applications for foreign exchange were limited to tuition fees for students studying abroad, medical treatment expenses for those who could not be treated in the country, expenses for purchasing self-use medicines that could not be purchased in the country, travel expenses and living expenses for government personnel going abroad, and life insurance premiums. Industrial and commercial businesses were limited to insurance, film companies, and equipment and raw materials approved by the War Production Bureau. Moreover, there were not many actual applicants, and most of them were applications from government agencies. During this period, a total of US$8,997,082.02, GBP 2,010,374, and INR 23,395,100 were sold, totaling US$64,200,845.95. Among them, applications from agencies accounted for 87%, individual applications accounted for only 2%, and industrial and commercial applications accounted for 11%. This shows that the use of foreign exchange by government agencies was not strictly restricted at that time, while general industrial and commercial businesses and individuals were subject to extreme control (see the Audit Department's report to the Yuan in March of this year). During this period, of all 2,000 foreign exchange application cases, the Audit Department dispatched personnel to review them in March of this year under the order of the Yuan. As a result, it was found that there were eight cases where individual applications did not comply with regulations but were approved as exceptions. There were two cases where the original applications were from private individuals but were listed as applications from government agencies and did not comply with regulations. The total was only over US$33,000 and over INR 10,600 (see the Audit Department's report to this Yuan).

(2) From March 4th to November 16th of the 35th year, was the period of the Central Bank's Foreign Exchange Examination Department. The standards and regulations for its examination were the Provisional Measures for Foreign Exchange Management of the Central Bank and the Provisional Measures for Import and Export Trade. Government agencies applying for foreign exchange were initially approved in part by the Ministry of Finance, and later all were approved by the Executive Yuan. The foreign exchange business operated by designated banks, in addition to export goods, overseas Chinese remittances, and individual applications, was mainly import trade. Moreover, the bank supplied foreign exchange applications as much as possible. At that time, the difference between the black market exchange rate and the official rate was still small, and for some goods for which it was not easy to apply for foreign exchange, manufacturers often purchased and imported them with their own foreign exchange. Therefore, the value of imports was actually much higher than that approved by the designated banks. After September, the Central Bank gradually tightened restrictions on imported goods. As a result, the foreign exchange black market was 50% higher than the official price, and the value of goods for which import approval was applied for increased daily. Therefore, there were strict restrictions on prior examination on November 17th. During this period, according to the Audit Department's review by personnel dispatched in March of this year, in addition to finding that designated banks had sold foreign exchange directly without the approval of the bank in cases of special circumstances, and had sold foreign exchange to those who had not obtained import permits, and the Foreign Exchange Examination Department of the Central Bank had sent letters to correct them, but not all of them had complied. Regarding the investigation of foreign exchange applications from government agencies, because the Executive Yuan's foreign exchange examination work had no fixed examination institution at that time, and there were no detailed regulations, the approval was either done by the Executive Yuan's official documents or decided by former President Soong himself, instructing the bank to allocate and sell foreign exchange. There were many cases where the formal procedures were obviously not followed. Several examples are listed below: 1. The foreign exchange diary account of the Business Bureau of the Central Bank on April 5th of the 35th year, lists a handwritten note from former President Soong saying: "The government allocates US$100,000 to the family of Guo Shi Wu as a reward for the family's donation of the porcelain collection, which has been approved by the Yuan meeting. Please immediately issue ten checks for US$10,000 each from the China Bank in New York, to be collected by Guo Zhaojun" (the original note is kept at the Central Bank). Was the Guo family donating porcelain in the United States? What was it used for? Where was it kept? Inquiries to the Executive Yuan revealed that there were no files to be found. To spend such a large amount of foreign exchange, which was not a military or political emergency, and to not follow normal procedures, is truly perplexing. 2. On April 11th of the 35th year, former President Soong sent an English note to Bei Zuyi stating: "T.V. Soong on behalf of the government purchased three ships from the Canadian government for CAD 5,750,000.00. I have telegraphed Xi Demao (China Bank in New York) to first pay T.A. Soong CAD 1,575,000.00, and pay the full amount when preparing to depart. Please also instruct Xi Demao to reimburse." (The original English note and translation are kept at the Central Bank). The Central Bank immediately contacted Xi Demao, and as a result, on April 23rd, sent a letter to the Treasury Department of the Ministry of Finance, requesting permission to allocate funds for reimbursement, and reported to the Executive Yuan. However, there was no formal document in the file from the Treasury Department approving reimbursement or from the Executive Yuan regarding the entire ship purchase. A total of CAD 1,580,028.78 was paid for the three ships. The advance payment of CAD 310,000.00 was converted to CNY 569,272,723.60, which was requested from the Treasury Department for reimbursement on April 23rd of the 35th year. Another CAD 1,270,028.78 was paid on July 15th, converted to CNY 2,565,458,135.60, which was listed as a debt of the Ministry of Finance on July 20th. 3. From March 4th of the 35th year to February 15th of the 36th year, foreign ships were chartered to transport coal from Qinhuangdao to Shanghai. The freight was paid in foreign exchange, totaling US$8,454,290.00 and GBP 497,431, accounting for almost half of the total US dollars and over half of the total British pounds of individual and non-import foreign exchange during this period. According to the general order issued by the Executive Yuan in August of the 35th year, all expenses within China, regardless of the sale of goods or compensation for work, should be calculated in legal tender, except for those specially approved by the government, and should not be paid in foreign currency. The payment of the aforementioned large amount of foreign exchange, even if specially approved by former President Soong at a time when foreign exchange sources were difficult, is still wasteful. In addition, the import of all kinds of goods, such as canned goods, fruits, and glassware, was too free, so foreign exchange consumption was the highest during this period.

### Content of Talks Between the Democratic Socialist Party and the Youth Party

[Central News Agency, This City] Cui Xin, a spokesperson for the Democratic Socialist Party, stated in a written statement on the 5th that, regarding the nomination of political parties to participate in the general election, a consensus has not yet been reached due to various difficulties. The Democratic Socialist Party believes that if the elections are not nominated by political parties but become a situation of free individual competition, then whether any members of this party are elected, or how many are elected, is not a concern. If this method is adopted, this party does not intend to participate in a coalition government, but will express its views on national affairs as a purely opposition party. As for the minority parties' request to participate in local councils, there seems to be a misunderstanding in the outside world, and some even say that it violates democratic principles. In fact, selecting a small number of members to participate in public opinion institutions not only does not have any undemocratic implications, but also conforms to the deliberative spirit of democracy. This is because one party has been under tutelage for 20 years, and other parties have no other opportunities to express the views of some of the people they represent. Minority parties attach great importance to participating in local councils. If it is not achieved, they will have no way to express their views, and participating in the government is unnecessary.

[Another Dispatch] After the Chinese Youth Party's Central Headquarters held a Central Standing Committee meeting on the 5th, spokesman Wang Shizeng issued a written statement on the issue of the Youth and Democratic Parties participating in provincial, county, and municipal councils and the nomination of political parties for the general election, stating: "The State Council's decision to select representatives from the Youth and Democratic Parties to participate in local public opinion institutions is based on the provisions of the Common Policy Guidelines. The State Council's decision based on the provisions of the Common Policy Guidelines cannot be said to be illegal. China has not yet entered a truly democratic stage, and many of the political orders related to promoting democracy are expedient measures for the transitional period. Taking the provincial, county, and municipal councils as an example, when their term expires and they should be re-elected, the government can also order an extension of one year. The immediate reason for the Youth and Democratic Parties' request to participate in local public opinion institutions is that the term of the provincial, municipal, and county councils has already been extended, and it is impossible to coordinate with the general election to participate in the election of local public opinion organs. Regarding the issue of whether selected representatives can coexist with elected representatives, the facts of the constitutional National Assembly and the National Political Council can answer this question. This party believes that the Kuomintang will be able to uphold the principle of Item 6 of the Constitutional Implementation Preparation Plan passed by its Sixth National Congress, Third Plenary Session, and sincerely support other peaceful and legal political parties to facilitate the rational advancement of constitutionalism," and so on.

### Case of Corruption in the Handling of Enemy Property in Qingdao

[Continued from page one] It is reported that the secret reports include a total of twelve items: (1) From last year to April of this year, a total of 9,000 tons of unsold materials were transported away. Who handled them and how were they disposed of? (2) Over CNY 7 billion in national taxes were owed for the transported materials. (3) How much enemy and puppet property was taken over in Qingdao? Why were different discounts applied when applying to purchase enemy property, reducing them again and again? (4) How much property was transferred by the enemy, how much was auctioned, how much was lost, and how much remains? (5) How much property and enemy property was seized due to secret reports? Were the whistleblowers rewarded in accordance with regulations? (6) How much was the total assets of the enemy naval food factory on Guancheng Road? How were they handled? (7) The base price of the total assets of the enemy exchange was CNY 3 billion. Why was it sold for CNY 200 million? (8) What is the relationship between the Aquatic Products Company and Yizhong Company and the director? (9) How much was the total amount of materials and assets of the enemy North China Fisheries Association? (10) How was the Yinzhong Warehouse on Jiaozhou Road managed and disposed of? (11) Where were the enemy's leftover oak wood from the backyard of No. 23 Chengkou Road transported? (12) The enemy's leftover lumber at No. 19 Jinkou Road was discovered due to a secret report. Why was no reward issued in accordance with regulations? It is said that there is solid evidence for all of the above items. In the midst of the crackdown on corruption, all parties attach great importance to this.

### Typhoon Hits South China Sea, Central Weather Bureau Issues Warning

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 5th] The Central Weather Bureau has issued a typhoon warning and advises those navigating and flying in the South China Sea area to pay attention, stating: The typhoon discovered in the northeast Pacific Ocean off the Philippines on the 3rd reached 17.5 degrees north latitude and 125.3 degrees east longitude at 3:00 pm on the 5th. The wind speed at the center reached 14 on the Beaufort scale, and the wind force within a radius of 350 kilometers reached 7. It is moving west-northwest at a speed of approximately 20 kilometers per hour. On the afternoon of the 6th, it will invade the ocean surface north of Luzon and south and east of Taiwan and Dongsha Island. There will be strong northerly winds, heavy rain, and giant waves in the South China Sea.

### China National Aviation Corporation Adjusts Fares

Full Text of the Chairman's Address

To all members of the 10th National Annual Meeting of the Chinese Institute of Engineers: Your association's annual meeting this time gathers prominent figures from the engineering field nationwide, convening in the capital to discuss major plans for future construction. Its significance is extremely important, and its responsibility is even more arduous. It is hoped that you will, based on the spirit of courageous struggle in the War of Resistance, further promote and expand it, understand the urgent needs of the current people's livelihood, coordinate with the actual situation of resource undertakings in various regions, first seek effective consolidation, and lay a foundation for development. Prioritize the essentials and pay attention to the order of things, be practical and successful step by step, so that rural industrialization will progress day by day, and the modernization of industry will be initiated. Then, land can fully utilize its benefits, and people can fully utilize their talents. With our country's abundant endowment, we will surely overcome economic difficulties and bring the people's livelihood to a realm of prosperity and happiness. It is deeply hoped that this annual meeting will achieve special accomplishments in this regard, and the government will make its best efforts to realize it. I urge you to work harder. Zhongzheng.

[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 5th dispatch] The topic "Intensify Construction to Save the Current Social and Economic Crisis" was passed in the engineers' annual meeting on the 5th. It listed four points regarding the construction that needs to be intensified currently: (1) Focus on increasing material production and employment as the main goals. (2) Under the current situation, industrial construction should prioritize: 1. Projects and industries directly related to increasing agricultural production, such as agricultural water conservancy, agricultural tool manufacturing, and fertilizers. 2. Manufacturing industries for daily necessities for the people's livelihood. 3. Transportation, public works, power, and fuel industries that coordinate with the above two items. (3) For production and construction projects that meet the above conditions, the government's funding and financial institutions' loans should not use inflation as an excuse to adopt the past austerity policies. 1. In areas where military operations are still ongoing, efforts should be made to protect them, treating economic strongholds with the same importance as military strongholds. 2. The recovered areas should immediately restore their economies. 3. Areas not affected by military operations should do their best to develop their economies. During the discussions in the meeting today, the economic strongholds and military strongholds were still carefully researched. The original wording was to treat economic strongholds as military strongholds, but it has now been changed to "equal importance."

Also: The Institute of Engineers believes that there is a need to revise the current auditing system. This was specifically raised in the special discussion on "Review of Obstacles Imposed by the Current System on Construction Undertakings" before, and it was specifically raised again on the 5th. The conclusions of the case are noted as follows: (1) Change from pre-audit to post-audit. Chairman Chiang had ordered this to be done in November 1945 and March 1946, and the Executive Yuan had also discussed implementation methods in May of this year, so the government should be urged to implement it as soon as possible. (2) In the future, when the government creates management regulations related to economic construction undertakings, it should invite various technical experts with experience to participate in the work, so that it is in line with reality.

### Our Country's Stance on the Greek Issue Reaffirmed by Chiang Tingfu; The U.S. is Willing to Consider the Compromise Proposal Submitted by Belgium, but Conditioned on South, Bulgaria, and Albania Implementing the UN General Assembly's Recommendations

[United Press, Lake Success, 4th] Chinese representative Chiang Tingfu strongly defended the United States in the UN Political Committee today, requesting the General Assembly to stop the Soviet Union's satellite states' violence on the Greek border. Chiang directly accused South, Bulgaria, and Albania of being responsible for the recent months of violence on the Greek border, stating that such actions had no justification. If it is said that since Britain is aiding the Greek government, Greece's neighboring countries can provide aid to the opposition, this statement is unacceptable to us. If it is recognized, it will inevitably lead to international anarchy. The Soviet Union and its Balkan satellite states have opposed the Security Council's intervention. In fact, any country that claims to be honest should not oppose international investigation and observation. If the Security Council wants to carry out its mission, it must be able to dispatch observers to any location in the world where peace is threatened. If the Security Council does not have this power, it will inevitably degenerate into a mere debating society, and the entire mechanism of peace will collapse. China has no direct interests in Greece, but because this issue is very important to the future of peace, it supports the U.S. resolution requesting South, Bulgaria, and Albania to stop and not provide further aid to the Greek guerrillas.

[Associated Press, Lake Success, 4th] If South, Bulgaria, and Albania, under Soviet support, accept the large-scale border patrol recommended by the United Nations Committee, the United States will relax its harsh proposals for resolving the Balkan dispute. This condition of the United States was proposed by U.S. representative Johnson in the UN Political Committee today. According to Johnson, if the three Balkan countries agree to this, the United States is willing to accept the compromise proposal submitted by Belgian Prime Minister Spaak on the 3rd. According to this compromise proposal, the United States will no longer directly condemn South, Bulgaria, and Albania for their responsibility for the Greek civil war in the General Assembly. Spaak's suggestion will enable the United States to implement its previous proposal in the Security Council, namely, to establish a semi-permanent United Nations border surveillance to monitor the northern border area of Greece. The debate on the Greek issue is scheduled to continue on Monday.

### International Conference on Freedom of the Press: We Oppose the Participation of Outer Mongolia; The Soviet Representative Criticizes Mrs. Roosevelt's Remarks

[Associated Press, Lake Success, 4th] Chinese representative Zhang Pengchun today opposed the Soviet Union's request for Outer Mongolia to participate in the United Nations Conference on Freedom of the Press and be allowed to vote in the UN Social Committee. Zhang said that this invitation had been repeatedly rejected by the Economic and Social Council, and that "Outer Mongolia is by no means a peace-loving country that can stand among other United Nations countries." Outer Mongolia is clearly not qualified to participate in the Conference on Freedom of the Press.

When the Soviet Union spoke up for Outer Mongolia, it stated that Outer Mongolia had a long history of cooperation with the Soviet Union. Zhang said, "I am delighted that the Soviet Union has so clearly demonstrated the cooperation between Outer Mongolia and the Red Army. I am even more delighted that the Soviet Union has clearly declared that Outer Mongolia is building a new army. This new army has shown its power to neighboring countries in recent weeks. Is this what is meant by Outer Mongolia being peace-loving?" Soviet representative Zorin accused Mrs. Roosevelt of using frivolous and near-reactionary remarks to oppose the Soviet Union's proposal for the United Nations to punish American "merchants of war." Zorin's speech lasted an hour, forcefully stating that Mrs. Roosevelt's views were not in line with the facts. "Why does Mrs. Roosevelt oppose every word in the agenda opposing fascism to protect freedom of the press? Why do we not openly propose the true goal of combating all forms of fascism?" Zorin reiterated his condemnation of American newspapers being manipulated by monopolistic enterprises, and "disregarding social issues." China, Britain, and France echoed the United States in opposing the Soviet Union's proposal, while Indian representative Bannerji agreed that "the abuses of newspapers should be prevented," but warned that achieving this goal should be conditional on not harming the fundamental right to freedom of the press.

### Mrs. Roosevelt Broadcasts the Meaning of Freedom of the Press

[Associated Press, New York, 4th] Philippine Brigadier General Romulo and Mrs. Roosevelt will broadcast the meaning of freedom of the press at noon on the 5th. Mrs. Roosevelt will broadcast first, and then ask Romulo about issues related to freedom of the press and war-mongering raised by the Soviet Union in the United Nations General Assembly. According to reports, Luo has proposed a motion requesting the General Assembly to convene a conference on freedom of the press in Geneva next year.

[Central News Agency, New York, 4th] Mrs. Roosevelt pointed out in her daily column today that the Soviet Union is using Hitler's propaganda tactics. She also said that the Soviet Union's propaganda technique is a "technique of lying." The publication of this article coincided with the time of her debate with the Soviet Union in the General Assembly on the meaning of freedom of the press.

### Disappointing

[Reuters, New York, 5th] The Second United Nations General Assembly has been in session for three weeks, and representatives are generally disappointed with the slow progress of the major issues listed on the agenda, and that the General Assembly may exceed its original six-week deadline. Some officials even predict that the General Assembly may not have ended when the Four Powers Foreign Ministers Conference is convened in London at the end of November. Since the opening of this General Assembly, there have been 16 plenary sessions and over 70 meetings of various committees and subcommittees, but except for procedural matters, no committee has passed a resolution, and the plenary session has not even completed the work of electing members of the Security Council and the Trusteeship Council. The reasons for this are nothing more than the following: 1. Representatives are still trying to make propaganda speeches. 2. Since the election of members of the Security Council and other institutions, directors, and committee members has not been completed, representatives want to use the debate to draw attention to their country. 3. The bloc voting system is the reason for the difficult birth of members of the Security Council and the Trusteeship Council. 4. Small countries are still afraid to rashly adopt a pro-American or pro-Soviet stance on fundamental issues. This is probably due to the excessive mutual attacks by the United States and the Soviet Union at the beginning of the General Assembly.

### Soviet Representative Advocates Expanding the Scope of Membership of the Far East Economic Commission

[Reuters, Lake Success, 4th] The Soviet Union has submitted a resolution in the UN Economic Committee requesting to expand the membership qualifications of the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East. The resolution stated that the original membership qualifications of the committee should be expanded to include all other United Nations member states in the Far East and Asia, and non-self-governing territories in the region should also be invited to participate in the work in a consultative capacity.

### The Iranian Government Obtains a Vote of Confidence

[Associated Press, Tehran, 5th] Iranian Prime Minister Sultana obtained a delayed vote of confidence in a secret parliamentary session on the 5th, after being allowed to explain the entire process of the Soviet-Iranian oil negotiations. The opposition party attacked Sultana's actions over the past nineteen months, arguing that they were illegal because they had not been authorized by Parliament. When the vote of confidence was taken, 93 votes supported the government, 12 voted against, and 11 abstained. The national ballots were blank. When the final results were announced, Sultana's supporters shouted "A good omen" repeatedly.

### The Disappearance of Eight Soviet Technicians in the United States is Not Accurate

[Associated Press, Washington, 5th] The previous false report that eight Soviet technicians who were studying American production methods in Michigan had disappeared is inaccurate. Immigration Commissioner Miller said that the matter was purely a "misunderstanding" and that the Immigration Bureau knew exactly where the eight technicians were.

### U.S. Troops Begin to Withdraw from Italy

[United Press, Rome, 4th] The U.S. Mediterranean Command announced today that the U.S. occupation forces will begin withdrawing from Italy next Monday. The last batch, except for a small number of cleanup units, will depart on December 2. The Italian peace treaty was approved on September 15, and the occupation forces should withdraw from Italy within 90 days.

### The Left-Wing Motion of No Confidence is Rejected; The Italian Government's Position is Stable; The Foreign Minister Announces that the U.S. Agrees to Give Up the Italian Warships Allotted for Reparations

[Associated Press, Rome, 4th] The motion of no confidence in the non-Communist government led by Prime Minister Gasperi, proposed by Left-Wing Socialist Party leader Nanni, was rejected by the Italian Constituent Assembly by a vote of 271 to 179. Communist Party leader Togliatti immediately withdrew his motion of no confidence. In June, the Constituent Assembly passed a vote of confidence in Gasperi by a difference of 43 votes. The difference on the 4th was 93 votes, more than double. With Nanni failing and Togliatti withdrawing his motion, the attempts by the extreme left to join the government have failed.

[United Press, Rome, 4th] Foreign Minister Sforza announced to the Constituent Assembly today that the United States has agreed to give up the Italian fleet allotted under reparations. The entire place cheered unanimously, and even the Communist Party members had to join in. Sforza continued that the Italian delegation will soon go to the Soviet Union to conduct trade negotiations.

### British Cabinet Reshuffle to Be Announced in Days

[Reuters, London, 5th] Prime Minister Attlee will finalize the final plans for the cabinet reshuffle this weekend, and the new lineup will be announced on Monday or Tuesday of next week. So far, those who will be changed remain a closely guarded secret. Among the various speculations, the most valuable ones are as follows: Defence Minister Alexander is the most likely to leave the cabinet. His participation in the cabinet is mostly due to his political leadership in the economic cooperation movement. He is 62 years old, and in terms of age, it is appropriate for him to join the House of Lords. Commonwealth Relations Secretary Lord Addison is 78 years old and has repeatedly expressed his willingness to retire, so his departure from the cabinet in this reshuffle is inevitable. Fuel Minister Shinwell is likely to leave the cabinet due to last winter's fuel crisis and his offense to the middle class who support the government. However, it is said that Shinwell will succeed Addison as Commonwealth Relations Secretary. Supply Minister Wilmot, who is said to be the one who prompted the cabinet's decision to postpone the nationalization of steel, is disliked by the left wing of the Labour Party and is likely to be dismissed. If so, the position may be taken over by Bevin, the current Health Minister who is a leader of the radical faction in the cabinet. However, since Bevin is determined to make the government's housing construction plan a success, he may not want to give up his position as Health Minister. Food Minister Strachey, who handles the most difficult affairs, has surprisingly achieved equal success, so he may be promoted to Defence Minister, which belongs to the inner cabinet.

### Philippine Representative Suggests to the UN General Assembly Launching a New Marshall Plan; Europe and Asia Should Not Be Treated Unfairly

[Reuters, Lake Success, 4th] Philippine representative Quinto suggested in the UN Economic Committee that another "Marshall Aid Plan" be launched to investigate underdeveloped regions such as Asia. He expressed regret that the report on the Marshall Plan only involved Europe and did not involve underdeveloped regions. Because if there is a report on the amount of dollars needed worldwide, the needs of the world can be understood, and global resources can be systematically planned and distributed. Quinto supported the statement of the Indian representative, believing that more attention should be paid to underdeveloped regions.

### Britain Will Build a Supply Base in East Africa

[Reuters, London, 5th] The British Army will establish the largest supply base in Africa in recent years this month. The main base will be located in Mombasa, Kenya, East Africa, just below the equator, halfway between Cairo and Cape Town. The construction cost will reach millions of pounds and will take many years. This base will be the main overseas base of the British Army. The British military supplies currently in Egypt and India, as well as the British military supplies in Palestine after the British army withdraws from there, will be moved to this base.

### The British Princess's Wedding Cake, a Luxurious Four-Layer Cake with Complex Designs and Deep Meanings

[Reuters, London, 5th] The National Confectioners' Association bulletin said that the design of Princess Elizabeth's wedding cake has been approved by the princess. The cake is divided into four layers. The first layer has the badges of the new couple, the Windsor badge, the Borough badge, and the Buckingham Palace pattern; the second layer has the handbag obtained by the princess when she was granted the freedom of the city of Windsor, the princess inspecting troops as the captain of the guards, the Battle of Cape Matapan, various musical symbols, and patterns of various sports; the third layer has a cupid holding a shield with the initials of the new couple, the naval badge of the House of Mountbatten, badges of auxiliary teams and women's teams, and the patterns of the battleship Valiant, drawn by Captain Mountbatten, which participated in the Battle of Cape Matapan; the fourth layer will be the national emblems of the self-governing colonies, namely Australia, Canada, South Africa, New Zealand, India, and Pakistan.

[United Press, Sydney, 4th] The wedding cake sent by the Australian Country Women's Association to Princess Elizabeth and Lieutenant Mountbatten was shipped to London today. The cake is divided into six layers, weighing one hundred and thirty pounds. The bottom layer is decorated with the Australian emblem, and each layer represents a state.

### Churchill Suggests Requesting Money from India and Egypt; The Conservative Party Annual Meeting Announces Its Conclusion

[Associated Press, Brighton, 4th] The Conservative Party Annual Meeting closed here on the evening of the 4th. Amidst the cheers of 5,000 representatives, Churchill demanded that Britain request from India, Egypt, and several other allied countries the expenses for Britain's assistance in defending them from the aggression of Germany, Japan, and Italy. Britain's assistance to other countries during the war resulted in heavy debts, and half of its overseas investments were also sold, so the current economic crisis in Britain is mostly due to this. Britain assisted Egypt, India, and several allied countries in resisting the Axis powers and incurred debts, resulting in the need to pay millions of pounds annually, "Therefore, I think we should raise a counter-claim for assistance, because in fact they are the debtors, not us."

### Wallace Is Scheduled to Go to the Holy Land for Inspection and Will Not Give Public Speeches Abroad

[Reuters, New York, 4th] Former U.S. Vice President Wallace said here that he is scheduled to travel by plane to Palestine on October 17 with Schuyler, the publisher of the "New Republic Magazine" that he edits, to talk with Arab and Jewish groups and to investigate the agricultural resources of the Holy Land. He does not intend to give public speeches abroad, but will publish his findings in his magazine.

### Churchill Is Surrounded; His Beloved Dog Dies

[United Press, Brighton, England, 4th] Crowds followed and surrounded Churchill all day on Saturday, and Churchill's French poodle dog, which left Churchill's entourage on the Brighton beach, was crushed to death by a bus.

### France's Economic Crisis Is Increasingly Urgent; It Plans to Use All Available Dollars

[Reuters, Washington, 4th] French officials revealed that they are discussing the possibility of using the remaining portion of the U.S. Export-Import Bank and World Bank loans to France to purchase necessary U.S. imports.

Of the $250 million in World Bank loans to France, approximately $40 million remains, and approximately $180 million in Export-Import Bank loans also remain. These funds have been designated for the purchase of materials specifically for construction. French officials are doubtful whether the World Bank will allow the funds to be transferred for "emergency" use, but up to $60 million of the Export-Import Bank loans can be transferred to pay for wheat and coal purchased from the U.S. Other funds for France's "emergency" use include: 1. Approximately $93 million, the value of German plundered gold allocated to France by the Brussels Tripartite Commission. 2. A total of approximately $50 million in various wartime compensation fees paid by the United States; 3. Purchasing dollars from the International Monetary Fund again. In the past, France was able to obtain $25 million in dollars from the Fund in exchange for its reserves. French officials expect that the U.S. Congress will not pass any aid funds before the end of December, and France needs a minimum of $120 million per month, so France needs at least $200 million to pay for urgently needed coal and grain.

### South Korean Right-Wing Youth Groups Hold Large-Scale Demonstrations Demanding That U.S. Troops Continue to Be Stationed in Korea Demonstrators Raise Fierce Anti-Soviet Slogans

[Associated Press, Seoul, 5th] Approximately 60,000 members of the right-wing Korean Youth Association gathered at the Seoul Stadium on the 5th to oppose the possibility of U.S. troops withdrawing from Korea. The Korean Youth Association is composed of various far-right youth groups, with the largest unit being the Seobuk Youth Association, originally a group of exiled North Korean youths. The demonstrators entered the stadium in orderly rows from various districts of Seoul. U.S. military police were also fully mobilized and ordered to provide full assistance to the Korean police during the dispersal if necessary. The demonstrators held up banners with slogans such as "Down with the Soviet Union" and "Oppose the withdrawal of U.S. troops." According to a report, the U.S. military police have been ordered to use force to suppress any participants who attempt to cause chaos. At least 30 people were arrested in the fighting, and the number of injured is unknown. The demonstration on the 5th was originally scheduled to be held on the 4th, but was postponed by one day due to rain. U.S. military police closely guarded Stikov's residence to prevent accidents similar to those on the 4th.

### Our Consul General in Seoul Departed for the U.S. by Plane Yesterday

[United Press, Seoul, 4th] Liu Yuwan, Chinese Consul General in Korea, is scheduled to fly to Lake Success on a Northwest Airlines plane on the 5th to provide information to the Chinese delegation attending the UN General Assembly to prepare for discussions on the Korean issue.

### The Chinese General Association of Batavia Issues a Strong Appeal: Indonesian Overseas Chinese Suffer Abuse; Memorandum Submitted to the Security Council and Consular Corps

[Central News Agency, Batavia, 4th] The Chinese General Association here, in its main memorandum submitted to the Security Council and the local Consular Corps, dismisses the "internal causes" usually cited by Indonesian Republican leaders for the abuse of Overseas Chinese in Indonesia. The text and photographs in this document consistently emphasize that Indonesian Overseas Chinese have no political or territorial ambitions.

The memorandum states: Although hundreds of Overseas Chinese have been able to accumulate wealth, it is absurd to say that Overseas Chinese are a generally "wealthy group." This fallacy can be overturned by refuting it with tax statistics. Some Indonesian Republican leaders, unable to distinguish, actually regard the mistakes of a few Overseas Chinese as representative of all Overseas Chinese, and consider Overseas Chinese residing in Allied territories as "not neutral." The memorandum also criticizes the pre-war Dutch economic system, as the Dutch authorities at that time had lowered wages to the minimum to allow exported products to compete in the world market and still generate profits for capitalists and the administration. The existence of this system, coupled with the Indonesian people's own lack of energy and initiative, led to the economic backwardness of the Indonesian people. The memorandum asserts: "It seems unfair to blame the Indonesian predicament on the exploitation of Overseas Chinese." In fact, despite various economic obstacles, such as regulations prohibiting land ownership, Overseas Chinese have been able to make a living mainly through diligence, frugality, and intelligence. The memorandum continues, stating that during the Japanese occupation, Indonesians had ample opportunity to compete economically with Overseas Chinese, and even to seize the economic position of the Overseas Chinese. Although they had assistance from the Japanese side, they ultimately failed. The memorandum concludes by stating that the Overseas Chinese truly do not understand the meaning of the abuse inflicted on Overseas Chinese by the Indonesian Republic with means to confront enemies, both before and after the commencement of the "police action" on July 21st. At the same time, the Indonesian Republic cannot claim to have been completely unaware of this abuse.

### European Communists Establish Anti-American Organization

[This Newspaper] London, 5th (Broadcast): According to news, communist party members from nine European countries, including the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, Poland, France, Italy, and Czechoslovakia, held a meeting in Poland earlier this month and passed a resolution advocating uncompromising opposition to American "imperialism." They also decided to establish an organization in the Yugoslav capital to be responsible for guidance.

### Japan Revises Criminal Law; Abolishes Lèse-Majesté and Adultery Crimes

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 5th] Since its opening, the Japanese House of Representatives Judicial Committee, after three months of deliberation, has completed the revision of the criminal law and has now decided to remove the "lèse-majesté crime" and "adultery crime" from the old criminal law. The so-called lèse-majesté crime was stipulated based on the inviolable right of the Japanese Emperor under the old constitution. The new constitution has removed this provision, so the provision in the criminal law no longer has a basis.

### Hitler Not Dead; More Conclusive Evidence Obtained

### National Defense Ministry Interprets Whether or Not to Postpone Conscription of Drivers and Others of Private Cars of Various Agencies

[This Newspaper] The Civil Affairs Bureau previously requested the Ministry of National Defense to interpret whether or not drivers, cooks, handymen of private cars of various agencies, ticket sellers, ticket signers, ticket inspectors, etc. of public transportation agencies should be included in the National Defense Technical Employees, and whether or not conscription should be postponed, in order to facilitate review. The Ministry of National Defense recently replied to the Civil Affairs Bureau with the following interpretation: Drivers of private cars of various agencies who hold driver's licenses may be deemed as specialized technicians, but their service place is not related to national defense industrial departments, which does not comply with Item 5 of the "Scope of Application for Postponement of Conscription for Specialized Technical Employees Related to National Defense Industry" promulgated by the Executive Yuan. Postponement of conscription should not be granted. Cooks in factories only add coal and are considered handymen, not technicians, and postponement of conscription cannot be granted. Ticket sellers, ticket signers, and ticket inspectors of public transportation agencies, although serving in departments related to national defense industry, are only ordinary employees and not irreplaceable specialized technical employees, and should also not be granted postponement of conscription. The reply concluded by saying: In terms of the Conscription Law, postponement of conscription is not appropriate for the aforementioned employees. In terms of conscription of volunteers, this year can be temporarily handled in accordance with the separate measures formulated by Shanghai. The person in charge of the Civil Affairs Bureau added an explanation to the end of this document, stating that the conscription-age men and those applying for exemption or postponement of military service investigated this year are for conscription use next year. Whether or not the city will universally conscript soldiers next year or only conscript volunteers, and whether or not the separate measures formulated by the city will be revised, cannot be determined at present, so whether or not the aforementioned sections can be applied to next year cannot be determined.

### Ten Thousand Mile Long March; Sudden Report of Disappearance; Two Globe-Trotting Small Aircraft Forced to Land in Xiamen After Encountering Storm on Way North

[This Newspaper] The two single-wing small training aircraft touring the world flew to the Far East this time. Due to unfavorable weather in Japan, they have been stranded in Hong Kong for three days. At 7:20 AM yesterday morning, they finally took off to come to Shanghai. However, one hour after takeoff, they lost contact with the ground. For a time, rumors were rife in Shanghai aviation circles that the two aircraft had disappeared. The estimated time of arrival in Shanghai was around 3:00 PM, but there was no news at all at the three airports in Shanghai: Longhua, Jiangwan, and Hongqiao. Although the Shanghai office of the Civil Aviation Administration repeatedly inquired with radio stations in various coastal areas, the result was still unknown. At that time, weather reports from various places all stated that the coastal climate was bad, and the wind speed would reach a maximum of 28 miles per hour in the afternoon, and even higher to 60 miles per hour by evening. Therefore, as a precautionary measure, the Civil Aviation Administration telegraphed the U.S. military to send a maritime search team to investigate along the coast, hoping to find something.

Until 9:30 PM, just as radio stations in various places were inquiring with each other, assuming the worst, the Civil Aviation Administration suddenly received a telegram from Xiamen stating that the two aircraft had landed in Xiamen and the people and aircraft were safe. At this point, the mystery of the disappearance was finally broken, but the staff of radio stations in various places had been busy all day because of this.

The two single-wing training aircraft touring the world this time each had one pilot, one named Truman and the other Evans. The only empty seat on the aircraft had to carry a large amount of gasoline, prepared for long-distance flight, so there were no assistants accompanying them. When the two aircraft took off from Hong Kong yesterday morning, they each carried enough gasoline to fly for eighteen hours. When flying into Fujian Province, they were forced to land at the Xiamen airport nearby due to the high-speed headwinds.

Whether the aircraft will continue to fly to Shanghai today will depend on the weather. Their "flight plan" this time may contact Shanghai to coordinate. If the weather improves, the estimated time of arrival in Shanghai today is around 2:20 PM.

The main reason why the aircraft lost contact halfway yesterday was, after investigation, that the wireless device installed on the aircraft was a small wireless station weighing only 26 pounds, produced by the American Bendix factory. Its communication range can reach 80 miles in good conditions, but only 50 miles in bad weather. Therefore, one hour after the aircraft flew out yesterday, the radio stations were unable to contact it.

### Madame Wellington Koo Raises Funds in the United States to Support the Reconstruction Service for the Disabled

In addition to the Municipal Health Bureau and various municipal hospitals providing free physical examinations, the service introduces disabled people who can be treated to various municipal hospitals for preferential or free treatment and rehabilitation. The service recently received a letter from Honorary Chairman Madame Wellington Koo from the United States, stating that she has established a special committee in the United States to expand fundraising for the service, intending to use the proceeds to expand the service's operations so that all disabled people in the city have a place to turn to. Madame Koo also said that the work of reconstructing the disabled is still a pioneering effort in our country. She hopes that people in our country who are enthusiastic about social work will provide assistance to enable its operations to develop even further.

### Hou Debang Returns After Negotiating the Recovery of Equipment for Yongli: Seeing the Fearful Reconstruction of Japan from the Needs of Industrial Coal

[Special Article] Hou Debang, the world-renowned Chinese chemist, recently returned to Tianjin from Japan, and then arrived in Shanghai. In two weeks, he will go to India to design a soda ash plant, and then go to the United States to order new machinery for the Xiang Factory. I paid a visit to him yesterday and talked about his experiences in Japan, which evoked many emotions in him.

His trip to Japan this time was to negotiate the recovery of nitric acid manufacturing equipment that had been dismantled by the Japanese during the war for the Yongli Company. After the Japanese obtained this equipment, they transported it back to their own factories for use. Much of it was damaged, but much was also added. Repeated negotiations with the Allied Headquarters were unsuccessful. The crux of the matter was that the Allied Headquarters insisted that wartime losses must be settled within the compensation items, and the equipment added by the Japanese could not be recovered. The Yongli Company did not agree, believing that a complete settlement of the compensation issue was truly far off, and they could not "wait for a rabbit to run into a tree stump." Hou's efforts in Japan this time made the Allied Headquarters relent, allowing the Yongli Company to be an exception, agreeing that they could recover the parts added by the Japanese. However, the Allied Headquarters still refused to change this principle of return. The equipment, worth $500,000, is currently being packed and will be shipped back to the motherland in three months.

Rapid Industrial Recovery in Japan

Hou took the opportunity to visit Japanese industries, and he was surprised by the speed of recovery. Most industries have already recovered one-third or even one-half of pre-war production. The chemical fertilizer industry is moving the fastest and will soon be equal to pre-war levels. Allied countries are surpassing pre-war levels. In general, except for heavy industries, industrial recovery is very fast. We can use industrial coal as a measure to see the fearful reconstruction of Japan. They now produce 2 million tons of coal per month, and the national goal is 30 million tons, but due to the rapid recovery of industry, coal is not enough to meet needs. The Japanese are working hard across the country, and they are doing so in an organized and policy-driven way. Their officials and people are cooperating from top to bottom, and their style is consistent.

United States is Magnanimous on Reparations

I reminded him that he had been very pessimistic about reparations in his conversation with reporters in Tianjin. He smiled and denied it: "This is the truth." He believes that early dismantling is guaranteed, but the allocation time will be extended to a year and a half. What our country can be divided into is 18,000 pieces of scattered machinery, not complete sets of factory equipment. The quality of the reparations machinery is still good, and he hopes that the government can allocate it to private factories. As for total reparations, he believes it is unreliable, because the American point of view dominates everything. US Inspector Stryker's background is American commercial interests. They hope that Japan will recover as soon as possible and trade with the United States on a large scale, so they strongly advocate magnanimity on the reparations issue, but they have not considered how to control Japan to prevent it from becoming an aggressive force in the Far East.

Best to be Self-Sufficient

The future industrial level of Japan, the Far Eastern Commission proposed the standard of 1931 to 1934, but it has not yet been passed. Hou said: "I advocate using 1930 as the standard, which was the year before Japan launched its invasion of China. At the same time, Japan was in a recession that year. In 1934, Japan's production had been raised very high due to military needs."

This industrialist holds a special view on boycotting Japanese goods. He said: "In the future, it will be impossible to distinguish between Japanese and American goods. The United States supplies raw cotton to Japan and collects its finished yarn and cloth, which are sold to various countries under the name of American goods. Therefore, a rigid boycott of Japanese goods is simply impossible. From China's standpoint, it is best to be self-sufficient in production, otherwise, when doing economic calculations, choose to buy what is cheap and cost-effective, regardless of India or Japan, are China's strong competitors, because the inspection volume of Indian yarn and cloth is currently the first in Asia!"

### Woman Falsely Claims Kidnapping Out of Desperation; Insurance Agent Sends Strange Letter Claiming He's Willing to Be Killed

[Report from this newspaper] On the 24th of last month, the city police department's detective division received a kidnapping report. The informant was a Mrs. Hu, a young woman from Jiangsu province, who stated that her live-in boyfriend, He Yucheng, an insurance agent in his twenties from Ningbo, had brought six million yuan in cash from Suzhou to Shanghai to purchase ink and paper. However, he was allegedly abducted by armed men as soon as he arrived at the North Station, who then demanded a ransom of 100 million yuan. He, lacking such wealth, supposedly wrote to Mrs. Hu, saying he was willing to be killed. Police Chief Li, seeing the seriousness of Mrs. Hu's account, immediately launched an investigation and discovered two suspicious points:

According to normal circumstances, a hostage held in a bandit's den, sending out a desperate plea, would never express a willingness to be killed.
After observing the situation from all sides, He was not a wealthy man, and while his disappearance was possible, it was unlikely he was kidnapped. Therefore, Mrs. Hu was questioned again about whether He had any relatives in Shanghai. She stated that he had an older sister, He Li, living at No. 6, Tongxing Lane, Bansongguo Road, in the southern part of the city. Section Chief Zhu Mengwei was dispatched with officers Ma Pei and Mu to investigate at the address. Her brother-in-law, Li Furong, 48, denied that He had come to Shanghai. However, the room contained many items He had brought with him to Shanghai, which Mrs. Hu identified on the spot, realizing He's deliberate plan to sever the relationship and to make her give up hope by faking a kidnapping. Fearing there might be other aspects to the case, Section Chief Zhu took Li Yanrong and Li Genqing, father and son, to the station for questioning while also issuing a warrant for He Yucheng, who falsely claimed to have been kidnapped, to be brought to justice.

### Dr. Ding Wenyan Is Invited to Broadcast "The Path Young People Should Take" Must Abide by the Law and Be a Model for the People to Enjoy Democratic Freedom and Happiness

[Report from this newspaper] This newspaper held its 27th special Sunday broadcast at the Shanghai Radio Station yesterday, inviting Dr. Ding Wenyan, President of National Tongji University, to broadcast "The Path Young People Should Take." The essence of his speech is recorded below: "After eight years of war, all construction in China has been severely damaged. After the victory, the country suffered chaos again, which severely hindered the work of reconstruction. Young students living in this turbulent era cannot avoid the pain of being at a loss and aimless. Therefore, the question of 'the path of young people,' although a cliché, is particularly relevant and needed when raised at this time and place.

[Picture of Dr. Ding Wenyan broadcasting (taken by this newspaper)]

China is now entering an era of democracy and constitutionalism. Young students are often misled by communist propaganda, believing the Communist Party to be a democratic party. The Communist Party also advocates "New Democracy," but the reality is quite different. The Communist Party is an extremely authoritarian and dictatorial party. In areas occupied by the communists, there is no freedom or democracy. Therefore, we believe that the government's general mobilization movement and the policy of suppressing bandits and building the country are extremely correct. We should guide young people to support this policy to realize democracy and constitutionalism.

If young students want to enjoy democratic freedom, an important prerequisite is to have a spirit of abiding by the law. Compared with European and American countries, China lags behind in everything. However, in terms of law, it is in no way inferior to European and American countries. China has a complete code of laws. If the people of the country can abide by the law and value discipline, Chinese society will surely get on the right track. Unfortunately, the intellectual level of most Chinese people does not meet the standards, so even with complete laws, lawbreakers are still everywhere. Young students must be able to be a model for the general public in this regard, using the spirit of abiding by the law to influence the general public and create a good atmosphere. Only then, after leaving school, can they lead the public to transform society.

The basic principle of abiding by laws and regulations is to cultivate moral concepts, develop good habits, emphasize courtesy, and maintain order, so that abiding by the law and valuing discipline will not become empty slogans. Every young person must be able to practice it personally. Recently, young students have become arrogant, violating laws and regulations, so that the atmosphere for academic research is becoming weaker. This is truly an educational crisis in modern China. Having served in the education field for a long time, I feel concerned about this phenomenon and dare not help but loudly call on people in the education field and young students to awaken. At this time, the only way to salvage the educational crisis is for young students to recognize the path they should take and to understand that only those who can abide by the law can enjoy the happiness of democratic freedom. At this time of social disorder, young people must be able to act as role models for the public by abiding by the law and valuing discipline, further cultivating a pure academic atmosphere, and strengthening academic research. In school, they should be good students; in society, they can become good citizens. As China enters a new era of democratic constitutionalism, it is hoped that young people can embark on the path of abiding by the law and work together to build a new China."

### Female Corpse Found in Western Pengpu Town with a Silk Ribbon Around Her Neck

[Report from this newspaper] At around noon yesterday, an unidentified female corpse was discovered on the bank of a river next to the Shanghai Military Factory of the Joint Logistics Command Shanghai Army Factory, North Shanghai Branch, west of the Xinqiao Gujiazhai in Pengpu Town, Zhabei.

### The Power of the Northeast: Three Major Power Generation Bases – Jingpo Lake Isolated in the Remote Frontier, Xiaofengman Enshrouded in Gunsmoke, Shuifeng in a Delicate State

[Our Newspaper, Hangxun, 2nd Day of the Solar Calendar] The Three Gorges hydroelectric project on the Yangtze River has been halted, and the Yellow River hydroelectric project is even more uncertain as to when it will be realized. At a time when we are unable to harness the power bestowed upon us by nature, everyone's longing for the hydroelectric power industry in the Northeast has intensified.

While the Northeast's water resources still await gradual development in terms of navigation and irrigation, the "Shuifeng," "Xiaofengman," and "Jingpo Lake" hydroelectric power projects have already achieved a good scale in terms of hydropower utilization and are known both domestically and internationally.

These three power generation bases are known internationally, but they also carry the flavors of sourness, sweetness, bitterness, and spiciness. Jingpo Lake is isolated in the northern frontier, its waters caught in a delicate relationship between China, Korea, and the Soviet Union. Xiaofengman, furthermore, is enshrouded in gunsmoke, unable to unleash its full power.

The eyes of the Northeast, the light of the Northeast, the power of the Northeast, and the concern of the entire nation are all focused on these three hydroelectric power generation bases in the Northeast.

Jilin, Xiaofengman, is the only one of these three hydroelectric power bases located in a recovered area. It was originally a small village, half rustic and half dawn.

Located in the upper reaches of the Second Songhua River, 24 kilometers from Yongji, it is the site of the largest hydroelectric power plant on the Second Songhua River within the Northeast region. The Second Songhua River originates in the Changbai Mountains on the Sino-Korean border, flowing through deep canyons and towering mountains, winding and twisting. Upon reaching Fengman, it suddenly opens up, forming a large abyss, before flowing north into the plains. Fengman is located at the point where the river's course changes.

The right bank is called Monkey Ridge, which stretches along the river, with an elevation of 900 meters, and a portion rising as high as 700 meters above the river surface. The left bank is the Laga Tower, a branch of the Motian Ridge, with a height of 770 meters, approaching the river flow. It stands opposite Monkey Ridge, forming a natural gateway.

A concrete gravity dam is built across the river at the gateway, cutting off the river flow and creating the world's fourth-largest artificial lake. Today, the renowned Xiaofengman Power Plant utilizes this

artificial lake water

's head and volume to generate abundant and inexpensive electricity.

The original plan was to install eight generators with a total installed capacity of 560,000 kilowatts, a large output of 480,000 kilowatts, and a potential of reaching 2.6 billion KWH. This massive amount of electricity would be used to develop industries throughout the Northeast and provide lighting.

The power distribution plan at the time was roughly as follows: 120,000 kilowatts would be transmitted to the Jilin area for the exploitation of calcium carbide mines (annual production of approximately 300,000 tons), timber harvesting, as well as supplying electricity for the paper industry, synthetic petroleum, and coal mines.

240,000 kilowatts would be transmitted to the Fushun area, supplying power for coal mining in Fushun, Xi'an, and Liaoyang, as well as for the exploration and development of coal and iron in the eastern border region and near the Changbai Mountains, the manufacturing of light metals such as lead and magnesium, and the power needed for heavy industries such as metallurgy and steelmaking in Anshan.

Another 120,000 kilowatts would be transmitted to Changchun and Harbin, supplying electricity for small and medium-sized industries, as well as general lighting. However, the transmission capacity of one of the two circuits was only half of the original plan.

On August 20th, Soviet troops entered, and on September 20th, construction was dismantled, leaving only two of the original eight water turbine generators.

Existing Equipment

There are only two machines remaining, barely functioning. With a maximum capacity of 70,000 KVA per machine, the total is only 140,000 KVA. The highest power generation previously reached 134,000 kilowatts. Restoring Fengman is a prerequisite for solving the Northeast's electricity problem and promoting the resumption of industrial and mining operations in the Northeast. It is also a key to the Northeast's current economic reconstruction.

Xiaofengman, via the Meihekou-Shuanggqian Road, mostly fell into the hands of bandit forces this summer. This high-voltage line, which can transmit 70,000 to 80,000 kilowatts, was cut off, causing a major electricity shortage in Liaoning. To solve the serious electricity problem in Liaoyang and Shuanggqian, the electricity bureau made various efforts to obtain 120,000 kilowatts of electricity from thermal power generation in Fushun and other places. The industrial and mining operations and lighting electricity in Liaoning and Shuanggqian were largely resolved. Now, with the transmission of over 4,000 kilowatts of electricity from Xiaofengman along the China Chang Railway, the situation may improve somewhat.

Since the Beipiao power plant malfunctioned, the electricity supply for industry and mining in southern Liaoning has been entirely dependent on the 8,000 to 11,000 kilowatts generated by the Jinxi Petroleum Company. In the past, the Japanese relied primarily on hydroelectric power, with thermal power playing a supplementary role. Now, it is truly indescribable.

The construction of the Jingpo Lake Hydroelectric Power Plant was one of the five-year industrial development plans of the puppet Manchuria. It was predicted that if the Mudanjiang River system could be

fully utilized,

300,000 kilowatts of electricity could be generated. The Jingpo Lake Power Plant is the first step in utilizing the hydropower of the Mudanjiang River.

Construction began in March of the 28th year of the Republic of China (1939), and after three years, power generation began on August 25th of the 31st year (1942). It is approximately 360 kilometers upstream from the confluence of the two rivers in the Northeast, in Abao Village, Dongjingcheng, Ning'an County. The power plant utilizes the water storage and tunnels of Jingpo Lake throughout the four seasons, obtaining a head of 57 meters. The lake's water area is approximately one-sixth of the artificial lake of Xiaofengman. When the large lake surface freezes, the elevation is 350 meters. During the summer when the water rises, it only increases by about two meters. The lake is approximately 42,000 meters long, and the width varies from 5,000 to 43,000 meters, with a perimeter of 180,000 meters. The deepest part of the lake reaches 50 meters. The famous Diaoshuilou Waterfall in Dongjingcheng is 13 meters high, and the waterfall pit is horseshoe-shaped, with a water depth of approximately 30 meters. Geologically, Jingpo Lake was formed when the lava erupted from the mountains in the west during the geological age, blocking the Mudanjiang River, forming a volcanic natural dam.

The local temperature reaches a maximum of 33 degrees Celsius and a minimum of minus 40 degrees Celsius, with a temperature difference of 73 degrees Celsius. During the four winter months, the lake surface freezes to a thickness of more than three feet. The rainfall during the three summer months of July, August, and September accounts for 70% of the annual rainfall.

Power Generation Project

At the northern end of Jingpo Lake, an intake is set up 18 meters below the water surface, and a circular tunnel, 3,003 meters long, is excavated. This tunnel has a diameter of 5.4 meters and leads north to a point close to the main stream of the Mudanjiang River, connecting to a surge tank. From here, two penstocks, approximately 220 meters long and with an average diameter of 2.3 meters, branch off and lead into the water turbines.

The used water is still discharged into the Mudanjiang River. Inside the power plant, the water forms an umbrella shape, creating a fantastical and magnificent scene that is captivating. After the victory, the power plant was controlled by bandit forces. Because it is far in the cold north, everything is in a state of "unknown situation."

The Yalu River Hydroelectric Power Plant is located in Shuifengdong, Gugokmyeon, Sakju County, North Pyongan Province, Korea. A gravity concrete dam is built across the main stream of the Yalu River from Shuifengdong to Bijiadzi, Kuandian County, Andong Province. It is 10.4 meters high, and the full water level elevation is 122.5 meters, benefiting counties such as Kuandian, Huanren, and Jian'an, as well as counties such as Sakju, Changseong, Pyokdong, Chosan, and Wiwon in Korea.

The Yalu River is the border river between China and Korea. In April of the 26th year of the Republic of China (1937), the puppet Manchuria and Korea exchanged a joint operation agreement for Yalu River hydroelectric power generation. Manchuria and Korea each invested 50 million yuan, organizing the "Joseon Yalu River Hydroelectric Power Co., Ltd." and the "Manzhou Yalu River Hydroelectric Power Co., Ltd." The electricity generated after development was equally divided between Manchuria and Korea.

The entire hydroelectric power plan starts from 17 kilometers upstream of Sinuiju, Korea, on the main stream of the Yalu River and extends to 480 kilometers upstream of Sinuiju. In this middle section, a total of

seven sluice gates

are built, with a total water storage area of 45,535 square kilometers and a total water storage capacity of 20.4 billion cubic meters.

The Yalu River Shuifeng Hydroelectric Power Project began construction in the autumn of the 26th year of the Republic of China (1937), and a portion was completed and began generating electricity in August of the 30th year of the Republic of China (1941). It was fully completed in the autumn of the 32nd year of the Republic of China (1943). It is the largest hydroelectric power project in East Asia.

One-half of the electricity generated by the Yalu River Shuifeng Power Plant should be transmitted to the Northeast region. At that time, "Manchukuo Electric" built two 220KV ultra-high-voltage transmission lines, one from Shuifeng to Anshan and one from Shuifeng via Andong to Dalian.

The Shuifeng power source was jointly used by China and Korea and should not have been a problem. However, this was not the case. The power plant is on Korean soil on the opposite bank of the river, and the dam is on our bank. After the recovery of the Northeast, the Andong area still had electricity. After the recovery of Anshan, a city of steel smelting, the Shuifeng direct line to Anshan was severely damaged. After the recovery of Andong, the electricity in Andong had to be exchanged for grain by the people. Andong is not a rice-producing area, so everyone encountered considerable difficulties.

Last winter, our military authorities in Andong sent personnel across the river to meet with the Soviet military authorities in North Korea. As a result of the negotiations, it was determined that our side

was responsible for dam protection,

and the issues of property rights and power supply would be studied. What is the situation in Andong now? Because the National Army withdrew this summer, it is impossible to know. Although the damaged sections of the Anshan to Shuifeng line have been repaired, where is the electricity?

The Northeast Electricity Bureau of the Resources Commission sent a letter to the North Korean Electricity Bureau in January of the 36th year of the Republic of China (1947), stating that the joint operation agreement for the Yalu River power generation project signed by "Manchukuo" and Korea on April 21st of the 26th year of the Republic of China (1937) remained valid - the original contract was valid for 35 years, and clarifying the issues of property rights and power supply. The response received was waiting!

According to a survey conducted by the Japanese in the past, in addition to Fengman, Shuifeng, and Jingpo Lake, there are more than 50 places in the Northeast region with permanent locations suitable for power generation along the Yalu, Songhua, Liao, Tumen, Longjiang, and other river systems, with a total power generation capacity of over 7 million kilowatts.

Hydroelectric power generation has its unique advantages in both power production and consumption. As long as the political situation is stable and the government develops it in a planned manner, the electrification and industrialization of the entire Northeast will be the day when the Northeast assumes the responsibility of the "general factory" for the national economic construction!

### Liu, Acting Chairman of the Textile Adjustment Committee, Discusses the Reasons for the Recent Rise in Yarn and Cloth Prices, Stating That Increased Production Will Inevitably Lead to Normalization and Hoping That Manufacturers Will Cooperate in Implementing Joint Distribution

Liu Siying, the acting chairman of the Textile Adjustment Committee, recently spoke to reporters about the continuous rise in yarn and cloth prices and the issue of joint yarn distribution, stating that the main reason for the recent increase in cotton yarn prices is the shortage of electricity and fuel, which has greatly affected production. A month ago, each yarn factory only operated for an average of four days a week. If they were to operate fully for the remaining three days, the production of yarn and cloth could be increased by more than one-third. Mr. Liu continued, "The government is paying close attention to this and is determined to find ways to save unnecessary electricity and transfer it to production enterprises. The Municipal Council has also passed a resolution on this matter, and the government is assisting yarn factories in generating their own electricity. The required 3,000 tons of fuel (coal) have also been fully supplied as needed. Therefore, in the future, all existing yarn spindles in yarn factories can be put into operation, and production will be greatly increased." According to his observation, the current rise in yarn and cloth prices is a temporary phenomenon. In the future, as production increases, supply and demand will inevitably tend to normalize. Regarding joint distribution, Acting Chairman Liu stated, "Before implementation, we will first conduct yarn inventory registration. The registration methods are being reviewed by a subcommittee and will be implemented after being approved by the committee." According to Mr. Liu's explanation, joint yarn distribution and yarn inventory registration are established government policies. However, in order to obtain the cooperation of manufacturers and jointly promote this policy, we are determined to solicit opinions from manufacturers in order to ensure smooth implementation.

### The Textile Adjustment Committee Supervises Factories to Purchase Domestic Cotton and Plans to Formulate Unified Purchase Methods, Establishing Price Negotiation Committees in Various Cotton-Producing Areas

The Textile Adjustment Committee has decided to start cotton registration today. All yarn factories or cotton merchants in the city must register their inventory to prevent hoarding and speculation. Those who fail to register before the 15th of this month will be punished according to law once discovered. The registration of yarn and cloth inventory has also been decided in principle and will be announced and implemented once detailed methods are determined. In the future, non-industry merchants will be strictly prohibited from storing or selling cotton yarn, cloth, and other goods, as well as warehouse receipts. Violators will be punished according to law. As new cotton has been listed in various places, the committee has formulated unified purchase methods. State-owned and private yarn factories will be supervised by the committee to purchase domestic cotton, organizing institutions and handling it by region and group in accordance with regulations. The committee will collect opinions from all parties and submit them to the ministry for record before implementation. Regarding the purchase price of domestic cotton, cotton price negotiation committees will be established in important cotton-producing areas, jointly organized by local government representatives, cotton farmer groups, cotton industry associations, and representatives of the committee. The price will be determined through consultation, taking into account the cotton production cost, plus reasonable profits, market cotton prices, and general price levels. The committee will determine the maximum purchase amount for each yarn factory based on its production capacity. If the limit is exceeded, the excess portion should be resold to the committee at the original price for necessary adjustment and distribution. Factories requiring funds to purchase cotton can apply to the committee, which will introduce them to the competent financial institutions for financing. However, the cotton used for financing must be manufactured in accordance with the committee's specified cotton yarn standards. In order to promote cotton seed improvement and improve yarn and cloth quality, and in order to trace the source of raw cotton, the committee may purchase high-quality American varieties for distribution to factories that imitate and produce fine yarn. Each factory's purchase quantity, unit price, and amount should be reported to the committee on a ten-day basis for verification.

### National Money Industry Conference, Thirty Units Have Registered

[Our Newspaper] The National Federation of Money Industry Trade Associations is scheduled to hold a conference on the 16th of this month at the Jieshou Hall in the capital. The program is scheduled for three days. The first day will be the opening ceremony, and officials from relevant agencies will be invited to give instructions.

As of today, thirty-nine units from various regions have registered for the Money Industry Association. More than fifty proposals have been received, with those related to legal issues, amendments to industry regulations, and income tax being the most numerous. These will be preliminarily sorted out at the fourth preparatory meeting on the 8th of this month, and the conference program will be determined. It is also reported that the association has a fixed number of thirty-one directors, nine supervisors, nine alternate directors, and three alternate supervisors.

### Prices Soar, Guangzhou Market in Chaos

[Our Newspaper Yanzhou 5th Telegram] The Hong Kong dollar has soared rapidly here in recent days. Yesterday, it opened at 9,830 and soared throughout the day, closing at 10,400. This morning, it opened at 10,300 yuan, a 50% increase in the past twenty days. Other prices have also risen accordingly, and the market is extremely chaotic. Rice prices have also increased by 10,000 yuan in two days.

### Thirty-Five Silver Shops in Guangzhou Request Registration Approval

[Our Newspaper Guangzhou 5th Telegram] The Guangzhou Money and Silver Industry Association recently applied to the Ministry of Finance for the registration of its fifty-six member silver shops. Only twenty-one have been approved, and the remaining thirty-five have been denied registration and ordered to cease operations within two months. The silver industry has been sending representatives to the provincial and municipal authorities for several days to appeal, requesting that they forward a telegram to the Ministry of Finance to revoke the decision. They have also decided to send representatives such as Guan Nengchuang to Beijing to appeal.

### 300,000 Yards of Japanese Woolen Fabric Still Stored in Warehouses in This City

[Our Newspaper] According to people in the woolen textile industry, "The 300,000 yards of woolen fabric obtained by the China Trust Bureau through barter trade with Japan were previously recommended by the textile industry to the authorities for export, but they are still stored in warehouses in this city. It is reported that Southeast Asia does not need woolen fabric due to the climate, and negotiations with the Near East and Middle East are still pending. This 300,000 yards of woolen fabric was originally surplus material from Japan. There were initially 700,000 yards, but after a portion was used by the United States, this amount remained. The British originally planned to transport it to Hong Kong and import it into our country at an opportune time, but this was prevented after our strong efforts. The quality of the woolen fabric is very good, and the current selling price per yard is probably over 700,000 yuan. Because it has stripes, it is not suitable for military use, but it is very suitable for allocation to public educators."

### Italy Invites Our Country to Participate in the World Commodity Exhibition, to Be Held in Milan Next April

The World Commodity Exhibition, organized by the Italian Ministry of Industry and Commerce, is the only organization in the country to promote the prosperity of commercial markets and develop foreign trade. The first post-war exhibition was held by the association in July of this year, with the participation of as many as forty-four countries. It is now known that the second exhibition of the association has been scheduled for April next year, still to be held in the commercial center of Milan. The Ministry of Industry and Commerce is actively carrying out preparations and will expand its invitation to countries around the world to participate. Our country will also be invited. It is reported that the invitation letter has been sent by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to our ambassador to Italy, who will forward it to the relevant authorities of our government to solicit preparations from domestic manufacturers to go abroad and participate in a timely manner.

### Goods Arriving Without Import Licenses Valued at Approximately 70 Million US Dollars, Concerned Individuals Express Two Opinions

[Our Newspaper] The quantity of goods arriving without import licenses has not yet been determined, but according to relevant individuals, "The goods that are permitted to be imported are worth approximately 40 million US dollars, and the total value, including limited import goods, is approximately 70 million US dollars. Rumors of over 100 million US dollars probably include a portion of automobiles. Regarding the disposal of this batch of materials, the idea of official price acquisition has become a thing of the past. Except for luxury goods, the rest will be replaced by taxes instead of fines. It is hoped that the government can classify the nature of the goods and then handle them separately, giving appropriate preferential treatment to production tools and raw materials."

Another business leader said, "I believe that the government can, in principle, allow this batch of goods because they are, after all, the property of Chinese people. However, due to the drastic changes in prices in recent months, merchants with these materials have already made countless profits. As prices are still fluctuating, merchants are likely to hoard them and not sell them even after obtaining import licenses. Therefore, after allowing imports, the government should force merchants to sell this batch of materials immediately to consumer organizations, such as raw materials being sold to factories and newsprint being sold to newspapers. This will have a good impact on production and price stability."

### National Bank Auditing Office Announces Statistics on Domestic Remittances for August

[Our Newspaper] According to statistics on the total amount of domestic remittances for August by various banks and firms in the city, released by the Auditing Office of the Central Bank, the total amount of remittances received was 1,730,241,455,234.06 yuan. The total amount of remittances sent was 263,168,044,147.09 yuan. The amount of remittances received exceeded the amount of remittances sent by 656%.

### Limited Supply and High Demand Drive Up Fresh Meat Prices

The price of meat in this city has risen sharply in recent days. Economic police officers from the police station have been ordered to investigate various vegetable markets and crack down on illegal activities at any time. It is reported that the biggest reasons for the rise in meat prices are: The severe reduction in pig production due to the floods in northern Jiangsu; Difficult transportation and increased railway freight rates, which have increased costs; Cooler weather, which has led to an increase in the number of people eating meat and a corresponding increase in demand. This has created the current price surge.

### The Announcement of the Thawing of Hong Kong-Guangdong "Through-Heaven Permits" Affects the Rise in Raw Material Prices in This City, and Import and Export Industries Hope for the Opening of Goods Imported Without Permits

Hong Kong-Guangdong trade has been in a state of extreme decline since the Guangdong-Kowloon Customs announced the freezing of "Through-Heaven Permits" on September 22. Because the Kowloon Customs issued the cancellation order too hastily, merchants were unable to prepare in time. It is reported that materials worth more than one million Hong Kong dollars have been declared but have not been able to be taxed and imported into the country. The face value of "Through-Heaven Permits" still in the hands of merchants but not yet declared also exceeds three million Hong Kong dollars. Therefore, Hong Kong-Guangdong merchants have suffered excessive losses and have petitioned the Hong Kong Tax Office and the Kowloon Customs. According to a source from the import and export industry in this city, the Kowloon Customs, in order to alleviate the difficulties of merchants, announced on the 2nd of this month that the "Through-Heaven Permits" issued before September 22 would be restored to use. After the announcement of this news, the market price of "Through-Heaven Permits" in Hong Kong soared from 35% to 57%. As for "Through-Heaven Permits" issued after September 22, because they are still subject to various restrictions on the face value and types of goods, no one is interested in them. At the same time, the prices of industrial raw materials in Hong Kong have also risen with the thawing of "Through-Heaven Permits". For example, the market price of industrial raw material "Moon Brand Caustic Soda" was 890 Hong Kong dollars on the morning of the 2nd, but it rose to 920 Hong Kong dollars in the afternoon. British Caustic Soda also rose from 840 Hong Kong dollars to 870 Hong Kong dollars. British Vulcanized Green rose from 620 Hong Kong dollars to 650 Hong Kong dollars. American Red Bottom Vulcanized Green has even risen to 540 Hong Kong dollars. The intensity of the price surge is unprecedented in recent months. According to a leading figure in the import and export industry in this city, the restoration of the use of Hong Kong-Guangdong "Through-Heaven Permits" can effectively revitalize trade between Hong Kong and Guangdong for a time. However, because the prices of industrial raw materials in Hong Kong have soared, and the inventory of industrial raw materials in this city is extremely empty, prices will inevitably rise accordingly. Therefore, it is urgently hoped that the government can quickly open up imports of goods arriving with self-provided foreign exchange and without permits, which can not only alleviate the panic of industrial raw materials in this city but also suppress market prices.

### Soap and Matches Both Rise in Price

Daily Necessities: In the soap market, the price of caustic soda, a raw material, has soared to 2.9 million yuan per barrel, causing the market to prosper. Rumors of profitable buying are spreading, and the market is rising. At noon, each case of "Guben" soap was 700,000 yuan, and there was still a shortage of supply. Deals were made at 500,000 yuan for "Huang Xiangmao" soap, a further increase of 120,000 yuan compared to the previous day. "Guanghua" and "Henry" soap also rose accordingly. The price of matches also rose by about 10% following the soap market.

### Interest Rates in Various Parts of the Country

### The Japanese Trade Agency Announces Detailed Rules for Trade Procedures

[Tokyo, September 30th, Aviation News] The Japanese Trade Agency announced "Emergency Measures for Private Trade Procedures" as follows: Foreign traders may freely discuss matters such as the quantity, quality, shape, loading time, and packaging form of relevant commodities with Japanese traders, but everything should be reported to the F.O.B., and the price should be calculated according to the US dollar price indicated by the Trade Agency. When starting negotiations, the content should be reported to the Trade Agency by the Trade Corporation as soon as possible. The formal contract of the Trade Agency with foreign traders should only be established after the export preparation application has been approved by the Foreign Trade Section of the Headquarters. Those preparing to export should submit the export preparation application together with the material conversion table and the necessary cost calculation form to the Trade Agency through the Trade Corporation. The corporation and the Trade Agency will then review the trader's ability, quality, etc. If it is deemed excessive, it will be submitted to the Headquarters in the name of trade to request approval. When negotiations are concluded, foreign traders should submit sixteen copies of the sales contract to the Trade Agency through the Trade Corporation. At the same time, Japanese traders should submit an application for concluding a formal contract to the Trade Agency through the Trade Corporation. After the corporation and the Trade Agency have reviewed it and deemed it appropriate, a representative of the Trade Agency and the foreign trader will jointly sign it. The Trade Agency will send ten copies to the Foreign Trade Ankle of the Headquarters to request approval. The contract will only take effect after approval by the Headquarters. After the formal contract is established, foreign traders should issue a confirmed letter of credit within ten days and submit it to the Trade Agency. When Japanese export traders have prepared the goods and are waiting for export, they should submit an export license to the Trade Agency through the Trade Corporation. After the corporation and the Trade Agency have reviewed it and deemed it appropriate, they will sign it and submit it to the Headquarters. When the Trade Agency ships the goods, it must prepare the following documents: 1. Business license, 2. Consular verification license, 3. Bill of lading, 4. Packing certificate, 5. Inspection certificate, 6. Weight and quantity table, 7. Health certificate, food declaration. After shipment, the Trade Agency will review it again, and then the Trade Corporation will submit three copies of the shipping documents, including two copies of the note payable in three months and two copies of the signed circulation shipping bond, to the Foreign Trade Section of the Headquarters. Another copy of the shipping documents and one copy of the export license will be sent to the Eighth Army. After the Foreign Trade Section of the Headquarters inspects the above shipping documents, it will issue them to the bank designated by the Allied Commander-in-Chief together with the check.

### The Velocity of Molecules

— Zeng Shiyu

Our concept of molecules can be determined by Avogadro's Law—that is, under the same conditions, equal volumes of gas contain the same number of molecules (see the first issue of this journal). But do molecules of each gas have the same characteristics? Gaseous molecules cannot be seen by the human eye, but the most enlightening phenomenon regarding the properties of molecules is diffusion. For example, when a colored or fragrant gaseous substance is placed in one location, its color soon fades and eventually disappears, and its fragrance dissipates without a trace. The reason for this is that gaseous molecules possess motion that propels them in all directions. Because of this motion, when colored or fragrant gases are gathered in one location, the gas disperses over time, until its presence is no longer detectable at the original location.

Since molecules possess motion, can the velocity of each molecule be known? Imagine a beautiful lady suddenly arriving at one end of a room. If we are at the other end, it often takes several minutes to faintly detect the scent of her clothing or perfume. Thus, gas diffusion is apparently a very slow process. Is the velocity of gas molecules also this slow? We must remember that the number of gas molecules inside a room is an extremely large and unimaginable value. When a fragrant molecule detaches from the lady’s clothing at one corner of the room and finally reaches the olfactory organ of a person standing in another corner, it undergoes countless collisions with other molecules. These collisions may cause it to move forward or backward, to the right or to the left. When it moves a mere inch in the room, it is subjected to thousands of twists and turns. Therefore, gas diffusion is a slow process, but the speed of diffusion should not be directly equated with the velocity of the gas molecules themselves.

Since molecules in the air experience collisions, do molecules of the same type of gas, under the same conditions (i.e., same temperature and pressure), also have the same velocity? Because of the mutual collisions between molecules, even if we take molecules of the same type and place them under the same conditions, it is not easy to ensure that their velocities are equal. Imagine two oxygen molecules, A and B, moving at the same speed and in nearly the same direction, meeting at a point where a third molecule, C, also with the same speed, approaches from the opposite direction, intending to collide with A and B at the same point. During the collision, A and B together exert twice the momentum on C, while C can only exert one unit of momentum on A and B. According to the law of action and reaction being equal and opposite, the reaction force of C must equal the action force of A and B. Therefore, after the collision, C must retreat in its original direction with more momentum, and its velocity must nearly double its original value. Similarly, the velocity of A and B upon retreating after the collision will be halved compared to their original speed. Therefore, the velocities of gas molecules, even if originally equal, will quickly change and become distinct after repeated collisions. According to the laws of probability, in a large number of gas molecules, the number of molecules with extremely high speeds approaching infinity will be very small; conversely, the number of molecules with extremely low speeds approaching zero will also be very small. Therefore, the velocities of most molecules are distributed between these two extremes. The British physicist Maxwell, based on physical conditions and using mathematical methods, derived a formula for the distribution of molecular velocities. This formula indicates that the probability of any gas molecule in a given amount of gas having a velocity within a certain range is a function that includes temperature, molecular mass, and velocity—though not a simple function.

For a given amount of gas, although each molecule has a nearly different velocity, under given conditions, the molecules of each gas have an average velocity. This is similar to gathering a crowd of people, where heights vary, but there will be an average height. If we accept Maxwell’s formula as accurate, the average velocity of gas molecules can be calculated using mathematics. But if we do not want to immediately trust this formula, which is entirely derived from theory, we must ask whether there are simpler and clearer methods to infer the average velocity. The first person to make this effort was Joule. His starting point was that when a gas is sealed in a container, each surface of the container is subject to equal pressure. This pressure is due to the continuous collisions of gas molecules against the walls of the container and their subsequent rebounding. Based on the magnitude of this pressure and the total mass of the gas inside the container, the average velocity of the gas molecules can be calculated. For example, the average velocity of molecules in ordinary air, as determined by this method, falls between 400 and 500 meters per second. This value is much greater than the speed of gas diffusion and far exceeds the velocities commonly observed by humans.

Since the velocity of molecules, as calculated, is such an extraordinary value, before we can directly measure the velocity of molecules, are there other observed and confirmed phenomena that can be used to verify whether this extremely high velocity is far from reality? Physicists have long known that the speed of sound in air is 340 meters per second. Air is a substance of very low density, which means that there is a large distance between its molecules. The vibration of sound waves is transmitted through the movement of air molecules and the collisions between them. Therefore, we can imagine that the speed of sound waves propagating in the air must be close to the average velocity of air molecules, and should be somewhat smaller, because the speed of sound waves transmitted through molecular collisions cannot be as fast as molecules flying straight without obstruction. Since the speed of sound is 340 meters per second, it is reasonable to believe that the average velocity of air molecules, as previously calculated to be between 400 and 500 meters per second, is correct. Furthermore, those who fire large-caliber shells on the battlefield have long observed a common phenomenon. If the initial velocity of the shell does not exceed 400 meters per second, the shell loses its velocity more slowly due to air resistance. If the initial velocity of the shell exceeds 400 meters per second, the shell loses this excess velocity in a very short time. The explanation for this phenomenon is that when the initial velocity of the shell exceeds 400 meters per second, a vacuum forms at the base of the shell. This vacuum creates suction and drag on the shell, greatly reducing its excessive velocity. The reason a vacuum forms at the base of the shell is that the velocity of the shell exceeds the average velocity of the air molecules, so the air molecules cannot follow the shell to fill the void left behind it as it flies. This fact also shows that the average velocity of air molecules, as calculated earlier, is indeed accurate.

In the last two or three decades, due to advancements in experimental methods, there have also been experiments to verify the law of gas molecule velocity distribution and its average value. The first to conduct these experiments was Stern of Germany. Many others followed suit. The results all sufficiently prove that Maxwell’s formula and the numerical values initially calculated from gas pressure are correct.

### Habits of Desert Animals

— Guanchao

Some animals can adapt to dry environments by regulating the loss of water in their bodies. One of the ways they adapt is through nocturnal habits, because deserts are extremely hot and dry during the day, and temperatures drop sharply at night. Animals such as lions, desert foxes, hyenas, and most insects like scorpions and spiders hide in shady places during the day to reduce body evaporation. They come out to forage at night, which not only reduces water consumption but also allows them to benefit from the moisture of dew. Some animals have particularly thick skin or are covered with a protective layer, protecting them from the strong sunlight, much like plants with very thick cuticles, which also reduces water loss. That is why beetles in the desert can still fly around freely during the day, unafraid of the sunlight, because they have thick elytra to protect them. Similarly, many lizards in the desert have scales, which serve the same purpose. Spiny-tailed lizards, called Agamas, in the deserts of North Africa and Asia, have bodies covered in spiny scales, resembling strong battle armor. In Australia, there is a peculiar lizard whose scales can even absorb water, which is obviously not for protection but for storing water.

Some animals have the habit of hibernation, much like some desert plants that can rely on seeds or dormant buds to hibernate for months or years, surviving unfavorable conditions. Desert snails can also stop moving when dry, as if dead. They revive when exposed to humid air, and their hibernation can often last for several years. Some snails close the opening of their shells with mud to protect their internal organs when they begin to hibernate. This hibernation ability is even more common in aquatic animals in the desert. When pools of water accumulate in the desert, many crustaceans and shellfish appear, living out their short period of activity. They use eggs to survive the dry and food-scarce periods. In some Australian deserts, shrimps and crabs can grow from eggs to animals two and a half inches long in just half a month. This extremely rapid growth is a common phenomenon among simpler animals in the desert, adapting to the dry desert environment.

This makes us think of a question: if these animals living in the desert were to move to another environment with abundant and evenly distributed rainfall, wouldn't they reproduce even faster? Wouldn't they grow even better? Why do these animals always live in harsh environments and cannot spread or proliferate to the neighboring areas of the desert with better living conditions? In actual observation, it is not difficult to see that the animals most suited to the desert environment are the least suitable for living in rainy areas. For example, considering the nature of desert plants, especially their scattered distribution, it is not only due to the direct impact of low rainfall. It is also because the terrain of the desert is simple, without flowing water causing any changes in the topography. Although wind can sometimes move sand dunes or rainwater can form temporary rivers, it is nothing like the complex topography of rainy areas. Therefore, desert plants can be freely distributed across the vast desert, while they are extremely restricted in rainy areas. Higher animals are similarly restricted to a desert life. The most obvious is their extreme speed, because the ground is flat and dry. Animals like the wild donkeys of the Gobi Desert and the wild horses of Mongolia, which are nearly the same color as the sand, often live in groups because they move so quickly that they can sleep in the open without being easily harmed by other fierce predators. Even those birds with developed wings walk more often than they fly in the desert. Birds that are good at walking have very degenerate wings, specifically adapted to the desert environment, such as the African ostrich, which is a good example. Many beetles have lost their ability to fly and can only crawl quickly. Animals that are not good at crawling often adapt to a burrowing life, and their limbs are always adapted to digging loose sand, such as the Spink Lizard of Africa, which is a famous burrowing animal, sometimes called the sand dragon. These habits would not only be unsuitable in rainy and topographically complex areas but would also be detrimental. For example, the camel's long legs and flat toes only allow it to walk quickly on sand, and it has great difficulty moving on muddy ground, and humid air is detrimental to its health. There is also a small burrowing rat in the desert with very long hind legs that moves quickly, as if flying. It has no weapons of self-defense, lives in burrows during the day, comes out to forage at night, and has keen hearing and vision. It uses its short front limbs to bring food to its mouth and sits on its hind legs, so it can see farther and detect enemies. If this animal lived in a place with abundant plants, it would be difficult to detect enemies and would not be able to move freely and quickly to escape danger. The Egyptian burrowing rat can only live in dry places. If it encounters humid air, it will go into hibernation. Another adaptive trait that often prevents animals from living in other environments is that their color is often yellow, similar to the color of the sand, which can be used as camouflage. In places with abundant plants, they are easily detected by enemies and may be killed. However, there are a few exceptions, such as the lion, whose coat color and lack of special food-grabbing abilities are originally adapted to desert life, but its strength and intelligence undoubtedly enable it to survive in other environments. Some animals that eat food have strong adaptability and can live outside the desert, but in fact, their distribution is quite limited due to the prevalence or overabundance of enemies. Animals such as desert locusts or snails can reproduce rapidly when plants are abundant and spread to areas outside the desert, but once they reach new areas, they are caught by many insectivorous animals, and few can survive. This fact can explain why certain types of insects in the desert never proliferate to areas near the desert.

### Words of Fallen Leaves

— Wan Peng

In the tropics, where rainfall is abundant, trees grow without obstruction, so there is no leaf-fall phenomenon. However, in temperate regions, when autumn deepens and the temperature turns cold, most plants cannot fully carry out carbon assimilation and transpiration, but their vitality cannot stop immediately, so there is the phenomenon of leaf fall. After many plants shed their leaves, the part where the petiole detaches is very smooth, such as with the Chinese parasol tree and the fig. This is because before the petiole detaches from the branch, a special tissue forms near the petiole, which is the abscission layer, cutting off the connection between the leaf and the branch.

The ordinary abscission layer grows between the base of the petiole and the trunk of the branch. Leaves that have grown an abscission layer wither due to lack of nutrients, so cutting a part of a branch that is actively living and stopping the supply of water to it will naturally cause the leaves to wither, and thus leaf fall occurs through the abscission layer. In the Virginia creeper of the grape family, the abscission layer grows between the leaf and the petiole itself, and between the base of the petiole and the trunk of the branch.

The abscission layer is composed of several layers of parenchyma cells, with shiny substances inside the cells. This is fat, which turns brown when silver nitrate is added. When the abscission layer has not yet detached, the colors are inconsistent on the two sides near it, especially on the enlarged petiole. To test whether the abscission layer has formed, the starch in the surrounding tissue can be tested. If an abscission layer has formed, the petiole part will not change color when potassium iodide solution is added, which proves that an abscission layer has formed.

These parenchyma cells of the petiole are acicular crystals, so they are very smooth after detachment; the fine granular spots left on the scar after leaf fall are traces of vascular bundles.

Now that the Mid-Autumn Festival has arrived and fallen leaves are flying, we should know why.

### Talking About Cigarettes

— Zhong Kai

A recent report in a London medical journal analyzing cigarette smoke stated, "The poisons contained therein, in addition to nicotine, include carbon monoxide (CO), aldehydes, and furfural." Nicotine in tobacco leaves is usually combined with malic acid and citric acid, but when heated and under reduced pressure (or smoking), it can be decomposed. Carbon monoxide is caused by incomplete combustion, while aldehydes and furfural are produced from the burning of glycerin, licorice extract, and other substances added during cigarette manufacturing to adjust the flavor. We know that a drop of nicotine can cause a cat to convulse and die, and three grams of nicotine can be fatal to humans. In fact, carbon monoxide is no less potent; it immediately interacts with hemoglobin in the blood, rendering it unable to transport oxygen to the body. Acids are the strongest irritants and have an irritating effect on the mucous membrane of the lungs. Trace amounts of aldehydes can cause tremors and convulsions.

Although a cigarette can temporarily soothe the mind of a smoker, it affects their physical health and numbs their spiritual sensibilities. Those who do not smoke should never easily become addicted to smoking.

### Latest Tuberculosis Prevention Vaccine

— Hui Shi

Following BCG, three bacteriologists from the National Institutes of Health of the US Public Health Department, Dr. Picard, Dr. Heber, and Dr. Alpha, recently announced that a new tuberculosis vaccine has been developed. For guinea pigs, this new type of vaccine is as effective as BCG in preventing tuberculosis, and it may replace BCG for widespread application.

This new vaccine is made from the bacteria of deceased tuberculosis patients, taken from a patient with a highly virulent strain of tuberculosis in Tennessee. After extraction, the bacteria are killed using ultraviolet light in a secret method. Because they are dead, doctors are bold enough to use them, but precise and careful research is still required before they can be administered to humans.

In the experiment, guinea pigs were administered a large dose of tuberculosis bacteria one week after receiving a single injection of the vaccine. They all contracted tuberculosis, but their lifespan was twice as long as that of guinea pigs who had not received the vaccine before being exposed to tuberculosis bacteria!

### The Almighty "Pegasus" — Bao Zhongqi

An expert in helicopter research recently wrote a book titled "The Almighty Horse." He believes that the helicopter is like a Pegasus in the sky, with amazing capabilities: it can quickly fly to designated locations with 500 pounds of air express mail; it can perform high-altitude surveying tasks; it can also transport 2,400-pound jeeps elsewhere; and most miraculously, it can replace manpower in laying oil pipelines or guiding water sources. According to American experimental results, helicopters can lay as many as 400 feet of rubber pipe in 25 seconds!

### The Future of Television

— Wan Gongyu

Einstein—now the world's greatest mathematician—is famous for his theory of relativity. This theory accurately indicated the principles of atomic energy. He has another great achievement: a new "eye" for the television camera (similar to the lens of a camera). This new eye is a thousand times more sensitive than before. We know that the main function of a television camera relies on the photoelectric effect of a photocell, and if this photocell is very sensitive, the camera can transmit extremely weak light or extremely subtle movements to the receiver. Einstein said as early as 1905 that the laws of the photoelectric effect are very different from what people generally assumed at the time, and this new invention is a direct result of his 1905 instructions. Einstein's photoelectric effect equation has been applied in practical work for almost forty years, and now television has a new vision, even more sensitive than human vision - its precision has made it possible for photographic equipment to work in the dark.

For a television receiver owner after the war, this is equivalent to a new radio that can report various sports or news in any climate, with candlelight or the weak flash of a match. You can even use it to see floods during rain, raging fires during fires, and even police arresting people under streetlights at night.

There will also be new developments in television entertainment. You no longer have to struggle to see small and tight scenes under the concentrated light of many mercury lamps. You can see the drama on stage as if you were in a theater, with every small movement and scene perfectly displayed. This new "eye" can convey the gentle lighting in a love scene, or the terrifying and dim atmosphere in a secret murder scene; even the light of a cigarette, behind which is the silhouette of a large smoker. In other words, all the subtle human movements - the result is something that Einstein probably never dreamed of forty years ago!
