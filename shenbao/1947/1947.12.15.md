### US Joint Committee of Both Houses Agrees to Include China in Aid Bill, to be Submitted to Both Houses for Discussion Today

[United Press International, Washington, 13th] The joint committee of the Senate and House of Representatives agreed on the 13th on an emergency foreign aid bill, including the full $570 million requested by the government, and including aid to China. Senator Vandenberg, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, stated: This compromise aid bill will be submitted to the Senate for discussion on the 15th, and the House of Representatives may also approve it on the same day. The Senate had previously passed President Truman's requested total aid amount of $570 million, solely for France, Italy, and Austria. The House of Representatives subsequently reduced it by $7 million and stipulated that $60 million of the $590 million should be allocated to China. In addition to agreeing on the total amount to be allocated, the joint committee must also resolve several amendments, most of which were proposed by the House of Representatives. Vandenberg told reporters: After lengthy discussions, the senators agreed to include aid to China, and the allocation of funds to the four countries will be stipulated in a future appropriations bill. Fortunately, any funds received by China will necessarily be taken from the shares of the other three countries. Some senators originally believed that China should not be included in a special bill providing aid to Western Europe, but because the House of Representatives "opened the door," the Senate does not intend to "close it."

[Another dispatch] The joint committee of the Senate and House of Representatives also agreed on the following points: Stipulating the end of March 1948 as the termination date for aid. The United States should preserve 150 million bushels of wheat and flour for the next year, unless President Truman deems it unnecessary on March 1st. Removing direct references to the Communist Party, communism, and the Soviet Union, but assistance may be terminated to any country that comes under the control of the Communist Party. Allowing the Commodity Credit Corporation established by the government to supply any surplus food, such as fruits, tomatoes, and some tobacco, in accordance with the relief plan. Cancelling the House's amendment to establish a special committee to oversee the foreign aid plan. Allowing the Reconstruction Finance Corporation to allocate $150 million before the appropriations bill is passed so that the aid plan can begin.

### US to Sign Bilateral Agreements with Recipient Countries

[Central News Agency, Washington, 13th] The US House Appropriations Committee is currently drafting a bill to obtain funds from the Treasury Department to implement the emergency aid program. Given that there is an unallocated $18 million under the relief bill after the end of UNRRA, it is very likely that this amount will be allocated to China under a future appropriations bill. In effect, this would reduce the amount China receives under the emergency aid bill, and this extra amount deducted would be given to the three European countries. The final bill authorizes the Reconstruction Finance Corporation to advance $150 million before congressional appropriations to implement the bill and stipulates March 31st of next year as the deadline, at which time these funds will no longer be bound by any restrictions. The United States will also sign bilateral agreements with each recipient country, specifically stipulating the conditions under which these countries receive relief and their commitment to abide by the terms of the agreement. These terms will be very similar to the existing terms of the relief agreement after the end of UNRRA. The $27.5 million under the UNRRA relief program for China is only in its initial stage, so it is estimated that this amount can help China through its difficult times before the State Department proposes an aid to China plan. This amount will not be deducted from future appropriations under the emergency aid program.

### Jian Guansan Discusses Impressions of Trip to the US: Rising Prices Will Cause Dollar Value to Decline

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 14th] Legislative member Jian Guansan, who went to the United States in early October for observation, has now returned to the country. He discussed his impressions of his trip to the US with reporters as follows: From 1939 to the end of September of this year, prices in the United States for things like food, clothing, housing, wages, coal, and lumber, have risen by an average of 99.9%. In the last three months of this year, they will rise by 10% compared to the same period last year. Prices for the whole year may rise by 15% to 20%. According to a report by the National Association of Manufacturers, the amount of currency in circulation in the United States is now three times that of 1939, while industrial production has only reached 70%. This difference is the main reason for rising prices in the United States. As for postwar aid to foreign countries, it is over $16.25 billion, and the credit expansion of bank loans totaling over $39 billion by the end of June this year is a secondary factor. Observing the current internal and external situation of the United States, these factors will not be easily eliminated for a while, so US prices will inevitably continue to rise in the future, and the value of the dollar will inevitably decline accordingly. Our country's speculators arbitrarily continue to raise the price of the US dollar, which is tantamount to burying one's head in the sand. Moreover, our country's economic situation is so difficult. If a few wealthy households and merchants remain deluded and still seek endless gain, there will be a time of common ruin. At that time, even those with millions of US dollars and gold will not be able to enjoy the pain of shared misfortune alone. Since US prices continue to rise, the prices of some items are even higher than in China. Moreover, China's light industries, such as shirts, socks, sheets, and handkerchiefs, as well as China's woolen textiles, are not inferior in quality to those of the United States, so why welcome foreign goods and despise domestic goods? In short, the United States has its strengths and its weaknesses. Our country's attitude toward the United States should be from the objective position of a critic, constantly studying its gains and losses, and pointing out its rights and wrongs. This will demonstrate our self-reliance and self-respect and gain the trust of the American people, otherwise it will only lead to the opposite result.

### Will Public Servants' Salaries Based on Indexation Be Implemented? It Is Difficult to Predict

It has recently been heard that the department in charge of finance believes that if salaries are paid according to this method, the burden on the national treasury will be too heavy.

The Standing Committee of the Political Consultative Council will raise it for discussion at this week's regular meeting.

### Soviet Union Postpones Repatriation of Japanese Prisoners; Allied Headquarters to File Protest; Number of Japanese Prisoners Detained by Soviets Reaches 700,000

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 13th, United Press] Allied Headquarters will protest the Soviet Union's excuse of "climatic conditions" to announce that the repatriation of Japanese prisoners of war in northern ports will be temporarily suspended until April next year. Allied Headquarters has also suggested sending icebreakers to clear the waterways so that prisoner repatriation ships can pass. In another protest against the Soviet Union's slow repatriation of Japanese prisoners of war, Allied Headquarters sent a letter to Kesslinko, head of the Soviet delegation, pointing out that in the same months of 1946, the Soviet Union had repatriated 22,000 prisoners of war from the same two ports: Nakhodka in Siberia and Zhengang in Sakhalin. The Allied Headquarters' suggestion to send icebreakers was not accepted, so it suggested that the Soviet side could repatriate prisoners of war from warmer seaports. The letter also stated: "The Supreme Command of the Allied Forces is prepared to provide the Soviet side with all possible assistance to maintain the originally agreed-upon pace of repatriating 50,000 prisoners of war per month from the Soviet-controlled areas." When announcing the temporary suspension of prisoner of war repatriation, the Soviet authorities cited the terms of the original agreement of December 1946, which stated that if unforeseen circumstances occur, both parties reserve the right to suspend prisoner of war repatriation activities. Over the past six months, the prisoner of war repatriation issue has been a major difficulty for the Allied Control Council for Japan, and the Allied Headquarters has been protesting vigorously against the Soviet Union's delaying tactics, as the fact is that prisoners of war held by other Allied countries have long been repatriated to Japan. According to the latest report, the new prisoners of war and civilians held in Soviet-controlled areas still number over 700,000.

Editorial

### Britain Should Not Persist!

At a time when the world is eagerly awaiting the early convening of the peace conference with Japan, the British government notified both China and the Soviet Union on the 13th, refusing the Soviet Union's proposal for a meeting of the foreign ministers of China, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union to be held in China in January of next year to draft the peace treaty with Japan. It also firmly opposed the demand by China and the Soviet Union that the four powers retain veto power at the future peace conference with Japan, thus plunging the Far East into a stalemate again after China had mediated between the United States and the Soviet Union and brought about a turning point. All those who yearn for an early success in establishing peace in the Far East cannot but express disappointment and dismay at the British note to China and the Soviet Union.

More than two years and three months have passed since Japan's surrender; however, the drafting of the peace treaty with Japan has not yet begun. How can the countries concerned with the Far East not feel anxious and uneasy! Although defeated Japan is under the occupation and supervision of the Allied forces, its rapid recovery has made every country feel threatened by the resurgence of Japanese aggression. Even the American authorities, and even General MacArthur himself, are hoping for an early conclusion of the peace treaty with Japan. Therefore, in August of this year, the United States proposed convening a preliminary meeting for the peace treaty with Japan. Whether for its own interests or for the long-term peace of the Far East, our country has always hoped that the peace treaty with Japan can be discussed and concluded as soon as possible. Therefore, we welcome any proposal that can promote the peace treaty with Japan; we are even more willing to see the American proposal realized as soon as possible. However, the American proposal differs from the Soviet Union's opinion on both the procedures for convening the peace conference and the issue of the four powers' veto power. If the opinions of both sides cannot be reconciled and a compromise reached, the stalemate on the Japanese issue will ultimately be impossible to break. Therefore, on November 17, our government put forward a proposal to reconcile the opinions of the United States and the Soviet Union, with two main points: ① The preliminary meeting of the peace treaty with Japan should be composed of all member states of the Far Eastern Commission, but the convening date should be agreed upon by China, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union as soon as possible in order to draft the peace treaty with Japan and to decide on special items related to the convening of the peace conference with Japan. ② The voting at the preliminary meeting of the peace treaty with Japan should be by a majority of all member states (formerly proposed as a two-thirds majority, but now a simple majority), but this majority must include the concurring votes of China, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union.

Our country's proposal not only reconciles the opinions of the United States and the Soviet Union, but also gives great respect to the status of the other eight countries. It is truly a reasonable and constructive proposal. If other countries can all act in a spirit of tolerance and use the Chinese proposal as the basis for negotiations, then the stalemate on the peace treaty with Japan will not be difficult to break, and a rapid turnaround will be achieved. Therefore, from that day on, we have been eagerly awaiting the practical replies from Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union.

The Soviet reply was the first to be delivered to our country on the 28th. Although its content is still quite different from the American opinion, it is closer to our country's proposal, which shows that the Soviet Union is by no means without room for compromise on the Japanese issue. In addition to suggesting that the foreign ministers of the four countries hold a meeting in China in January of next year to draft the peace treaty with Japan, the Soviet reply also firmly demanded that the four powers retain veto power. Whether based on reality or on legal considerations, the Soviet proposal has its full reasons, and it is not a far-fetched argument. Britain and the United States should give it careful consideration, and in particular, seek a compromise between the two sides' opinions under the principle of mutual tolerance and mutual concession.

However, after reading the British reply, we know that the British government not only opposes the four powers' veto power, but also continues to oppose the drafting of the peace treaty with Japan by a meeting of the four foreign ministers, and even expresses indifference to holding the meeting in China. Since Britain's attitude is such, the United States' attitude must also be the same, which goes without saying. It is also obvious that the stalemate on the Japanese issue cannot be broken.

In our opinion, British diplomacy follows the United States and looks to the United States for guidance. While this may be beneficial to Britain itself, if we broaden our horizons and look at the current precarious situation in the Far East, the great powers should no longer cling to their prejudices on the Japanese issue. We want to make it clear to the Foreign Secretary that the divergence of opinions among the four powers is preventing the breaking of the stalemate in the Far East and the convening of the peace conference with Japan. The result of this can only benefit the defeated Japan. A Times of London editorial on the 11th also warned of the hidden danger of Japan. What attitude should the British diplomatic authorities adopt toward the Japanese issue? There is a need for further consideration.

An Observation of Xinjiang from a Historical Perspective (Part Two)

Continued from yesterday's Sunday Forum

III. The Attitude Toward Studying Xinjiang History

Looking at Xinjiang civilization from the overall perspective of world civilization can inspire the profound feeling that human evolution is universally interconnected. It can also make the general public aware of the significance of evolutionary progress and know how to make choices. Today is the era of the atomic energy revolution. Standing at this watershed of evolution, looking around, one's heart is filled with excitement and self-confidence. Not only does the narrow and limited view of Xinjiang history appear outdated, but all so-called emerging civilizations also seem old-fashioned. As a matter of fact, all existing historical views still need to be carefully examined, humbly hoped for, and enthusiastically encouraged. I believe that compiling Xinjiang history must be done in this way, and compiling Chinese history or world history must also be done in this way. Only in this way can sound intellectual power possess a moral and spiritual force in the atomic energy era!

In terms of space, the expansion of world civilization roughly progresses from points to lines to planes to surfaces to spheres. The position of Xinjiang civilization is in this context. In terms of time, we suggest dividing the formation of Xinjiang historical materials into two stages for examination: classical historical materials and modern historical materials. In dealing with the classical historical stage, we should pay attention to the collation and analysis of various historical materials from China, Islamic countries, the West, and the Soviet Union, as well as the results of their mutual comparison. In dealing with the modern historical stage, we should pay attention to the synthesis and deduction of the above-mentioned historical materials, as well as their respective comprehensive outlets. Then, from these foundations, we can build a higher world spirit and give Xinjiang the world status it deserves.

IV. Looking at Xinjiang from Chinese History

Among classical historical materials, Chinese classical historical materials are the most classical. To study the classical history of Xinjiang without understanding Chinese classical historical materials is undoubtedly like a blind man talking in his sleep. This is an undeniable point. However, Chinese classical historical materials are not without their shortcomings. The biggest shortcoming is that the chronological order is often interrupted, with relatively substantial content only during prosperous times, while in times of decline, they become fragmented, intermittent, or even completely blank or disconnected. This is a phenomenon that must be specifically exposed.

Because the Chinese are the nation that attaches the greatest importance to historical records in the world, we can fortunately identify these chronological problems and alert those who pay attention to Chinese classical history in the future: the content of Chinese classical history is determined by the waxing and waning of Chinese dynasties' westward influence, thus clearly forming four centers: Han, Tang, Yuan, and Qing. Between these centers, there are often neglected gaps, discontinuities, or only very subtle connections. Generally speaking, from 126 BC (the third year of Yuanshuo) to 790 AD (the sixth year of Zhenyuan), during the 916 years from Zhang Qian's return to the east to the Tang Dynasty's loss of the Western Regions, although there is a small portion of time when the situation is not very clear (a total of 42 years, namely from 176 AD—the fourth year of Xiping—when Yanqi rebelled and the Eastern Han Dynasty was strong, to 606 AD—the second year of Daye—the year before Pei Ju re-established control over the Western Regions, because at this time most historians had fled to the Yangtze River), various records are generally available, and clues can be found. This is the greatest contribution of Chinese classical history to Xinjiang. Secondly, from 791 AD (the seventh year of Zhenyuan) to 1208 AD (the first year of Jiading during the Song Ningzong reign, when Genghis Khan invaded Xinjiang in the following year and initiated Yuan history), there is a 407-year gap with particularly scarce materials, simply and vaguely. Again, from 1331 AD (when the Chagatai Khanate began internal turmoil and the situation was chaotic) to 1714 AD (one year before the Qing Kangxi army entered Tibet), there is another 383-year gap with not much material. Moreover, among the aforementioned two gaps (i.e., the 121 years from 1209 to 1330), the materials are focused on Yuan history and are not very clear and not regarded by general Chinese historians. Therefore, for the 1023 years from 791 AD to 1714 AD, roughly ten centuries, it can be said that they are all intermittent gaps. In summary, the time with relatively clear records accounts for half (1037 years), while the time that is unclear or completely disconnected also accounts for half. These contents are the main basis for Chinese historians to study the Western Regions.

Secondly, Chinese classical historians, influenced by Zhang Qian's exploration tradition, are almost all most interested in geography, such as the geographical treatises in successive official histories, travelogues of monks and envoys, and works such as "Records of the Western Regions," "Gazetteer of Xinjiang," and "Records of Waterways in the Western Regions." Their focus is on geographical research as the main task, and they describe history from a geographical perspective. Therefore, they lack connected insights and cannot break the isolation of the Xinjiang oases. They seem unable to break away from the traditional concept of the Thirty-Six Kingdoms and lack the ability to classify them culturally. This geographically centered view has led to one of the main reasons why modern Chinese historians cannot understand Xinjiang culture, and it is also one of the reasons why they only pay attention to land and not to people.

On the basis of this incomplete historical data and geographical view, modern Chinese historians attempted to synthesize a system. This academic movement began with the inspiration of Gu Yanwu, Huang Zongxi, and others, and developed into the frontier geography popular after the Daoguang period (such as Xu Song, Fang Qiu, Zhang Shizhou, He Qiutao, and Wei Yuan). Although their efforts have contributed to synthesizing past classical historical data, they cannot exceed their limitations, and errors that naturally occurred due to a lack of understanding of the world were inevitable. Unfortunately, these seemingly correct textual researches are still used today by many people as if they were indisputable truths, and the problems arise from here.

After Western scholars arrived, the work of synthesis was just beginning, and historians with scientific minds and objective attitudes appeared. They translated Western works, researched ethnicity, religion, and culture, and conducted archaeological excavations with Westerners in Gaochang, Loulan, and Beiting. However, their attention was also affected by the limitations of classical history. Most of them only did specialized work in the ancient parts of classical history that had rich content, and have not yet exerted their ability to do large-scale gap-filling work (a thousand years of gaps!). Therefore, the modern Chinese work of synthesis can be said to have not yet begun. The only relatively concrete example is Zeng Wenwu's "History of Chinese Management of the Western Regions."

Based on the above-mentioned situation in China, my conclusion is: If the compilation of a general history of Xinjiang in China is hastily based on the current foundation, it will be difficult to avoid being influenced by tradition. This influence is the traditional concept of geography, national defense, and blind self-confidence in the prosperous eras of the Han and Tang dynasties.

V. The Influence of the Soviet Union

Also very important in this regard is the effort of the Soviet Union.

Although the tradition of Soviet civilization is only a little over a hundred years old, its influence is unprecedented, its scale is global, humanistic, social, and cultural. Therefore, the Soviet Union's historical work, its ambition, its concentration of power, and its close relationship with reality are also incomparable to historical work in other fields. For various reasons, although we cannot fully understand the Soviet Union's study of the history of Xinjiang, and study some of the current phenomena in the Soviet Union, we especially hope to cooperate with scholars from the Soviet Union to solve many historical problems that could not be solved under the early traditional efforts of China, Islamic countries, and the West.

First, we know that the Soviet Union's large-scale excavation work in Central Asia has exceeded the current total achievements in the world. Indirectly, the archaeological investigations in various parts of Xinjiang are not comparable to the sporadic efforts of Western scholars. We know that during the Sheng Shicai era, archaeological work in Central Asia penetrated into the Stone Age. The general investigation of Bronze Age civilization has made new contributions. Therefore, although the Soviet Union is a new country, and Soviet scholars belong to the newest school, the basic work they have built up is very solid. Therefore, if we want to study the history of Xinjiang in the Stone Age and all its ethnic social relations, the Soviet Union's data must be very helpful.

Secondly, in terms of textual historical materials, the Leningrad Academy of Sciences in the Soviet Union inherited the traditions of the efforts of the Tsarist Russian era, and with new perspectives and technologies, its comprehensive analysis and collation of Xinjiang historical materials must have achieved certain results, which we are pleased to hear. Moreover, the Soviet Union's academic point of view is comparatively biased towards sociology, economics, and politics, which is a good contrast to the West's emphasis on anthropology, ethnology, and linguistics.

Again, we have heard that many manuscript copies of original materials in Xinjiang are currently collected in the museum in Tashkent, the capital of Uzbekistan, for public exhibition. According to the magazine "Oriental Truth," published in that country, which specializes in the study of the history and culture of the Uyghur people in Xinjiang, there are as many as tens of thousands of these precious Central Asian manuscripts, among which there must be many achievements of anonymous historians in Xinjiang. Regarding this situation, we can only blame the stupidity, obstinacy, and ignorance of past Chinese officials, and cannot blame Soviet scholars for using them without authorization. Because from the perspective of Xinjiang civilization, which must be viewed from a global perspective, it does not matter who keeps them.

VI. Conclusion

Looking at the evolutionary processes of various historical views in China and the Soviet Union, we can draw a conclusion: The evolution of world civilization has promoted the evolution of various original isolated civilizations themselves. This evolution, in today's scientific era, has also promoted their historical views to embark on the road of modernization and globalization. However, the results are due to the different traditional environments, and the comprehensive achievements of China, Islamic countries, Western countries, and the Soviet Union, which produce different viewpoints and contents, still cannot be reconciled with each other today. Therefore, a general history of Xinjiang is also impossible to talk about, unless we maliciously want to rely only on some conclusions that are still subjective: such as the comprehensive forms of border geography in China, the comprehensive forms of Turkish national history in Islamic countries, the comprehensive forms of Western cultural history, and the comprehensive forms of Soviet social history, or a synthesis that focuses on one form while participating in one or two other forms of materials.

We propose that after the rolling campaigns of the frontier scholars of the Daoguang era in the past, the Turkish ethnological schools, the Western capitalist cultural schools, and the Soviet revolutionary sociological schools, we should launch a final comprehensive movement of Xinjiang history, and unify it with the great road of human civilization evolution. This is the advance of intellectual power singing and dancing. Invisibly, it can eliminate corruption, shift the atmosphere, and reverse the world! I sincerely wish that accomplished scholars at home and abroad can establish it in the spirit of science and democracy and in the mode of international cultural cooperation. I also earnestly ask all ambitious young people in the country to fight in the wind, sand, and scorching sun with the determination of pioneers.

In short, speaking from the current situation of Xinjiang, it is to study the history and culture of Xinjiang from the actual situation. Everyone is guided by the flow, but I trace back to the source. Then, when the source is in hand, the flow will be stronger, and it will eventually become a vast ocean, which can be inclusive and live as long as heaven and earth. According to my understanding, there are not a few people currently walking this path. For example, Li Fanqun spent a year cycling around the Taklamakan Desert, writing a monumental work of 500,000 words, but lacks the ability to publish it. For example, He Guisen, who is proficient in the Kazakh language, went from the Qilian Mountains to the Tianshan Mountains to interview nomadic peoples to collect data. For example, Li Beihai went deep into the pastures to discuss history with Kazakh scholars. For example, Mudiyi has devoted himself to Turkic languages for many years. For example, Haji Yahefu specializes in textual research. For example, Ni Yue holds a scientific attitude toward the history of his own nation (the Kazakh nation). For example, Muhammad, Alimuji, Paul, Liu Xiaoshan, and Di Yabin, etc., are tireless in studying history. The advancements, and then, like the youth historian Liu Kegu, who died in the desert, the scholar Wang Lairan, and the enthusiasm of the scholar Qi Guang, bring a bit of sadness to the lively atmosphere. This bit of sadness, the magnificent scenery, are enough to arouse the spirit of pioneering. (The End)

It is estimated that there are about 3,000 leprosy patients in Fujian Province, scattered in Fuzhou, Putian, Gutian, and other places. Only more than 600 people are currently being accommodated and managed, and they are unable to receive treatment due to a lack of funds.

### Disturbance at the Wuhu Zhongshan Memorial Hall Cinema

Conflict Between Students and Employees, Military Police

[Our newspaper Wuhu, 14th dispatch] During the 6:00 PM screening at the Zhongshan Memorial Hall Cinema in Wuhu on the 13th, a student from Anhui College was pushed out of the gate by a ticket inspector. After being humiliated, dozens of classmates from Anhui College came to question the staff, resulting in a conflict. A staff member was hit on the head, and one student was detained by the military police. Another student went on stage and ordered the students from Anhui College watching the movie to gather. That student was also arrested. Upon hearing the news, the students from Anhui College on Zheshan Mountain gathered at the Zhongshan Memorial Hall. Seeing that four students had been taken away, they shouted that four more had been arrested, believing that three had been arrested first and then four more, totaling seven. The situation became increasingly agitated. They questioned the military police as to why they were only arresting students. Fortunately, Division Commander Lin Zhan heard the news and immediately ordered the release of the four students and instructed the military police present not to use force. Although the students knew that those arrested had been released, they thought that three were still being detained, so they mistakenly destroyed films and other items in the cinema. The military police, having received orders in advance, allowed them to do as they pleased, so there was no bloodshed. Today, Division Commander Lin Zhan and Commissioner Yang Jixun received reporters and stated that although they cherish the students in this chaotic situation, they also hope that university students will set an example for the people, abide by the law, and not resort to violence. The case is currently being handled carefully by Division Commander Lin.

### Stalemate on German Reparations: Fate of Foreign Ministers' Conference Hinges on Soviet Attitude; Molotov Consults Government

[Reuters, London, 14th] After the Foreign Ministers' Conference concluded its Friday session amidst turbulent storms, the fate of this session appears to hang in the balance. Molotov has urgently consulted with Moscow during the extended recess, a crucial preliminary move. Based on developments in recent days, the Kremlin's instructions to Molotov have been distinctly negative. Molotov's demeanor during Friday's meeting forced the conference to seriously consider a brief recess, as proceeding to discuss other items on the agenda would be futile unless Marshall intended to allow Molotov to evade the issue of reparations. However, all indications suggest that Marshall is unwilling to permit Molotov to avoid this significant matter. At Friday's meeting, Marshall reiterated the U.S. position, stating that an agreement on economic unity, including full resolution of reparations and the transfer of German resources from various zones, is a condition for any political settlement. Therefore, unless Molotov can propose a method for handling reparations at Monday's meeting, the Foreign Ministers' Conference will, at least for the present, enter a state of impasse. It is anticipated that after the Foreign Ministers' Conference reaches an impasse, the next step in Germany will be to consolidate the existing economic structures in each zone. Marshall and Bevin indicated at Friday's meeting that under such circumstances, the Anglo-American zone merger agreement will continue to be implemented, but will remain open for other powers to join, with the ultimate goal of establishing German economic unity. Although Molotov's speech on Friday was highly critical, he did not express a willingness to terminate the meeting even before completing discussion of other items on the agenda. If, on Monday, he refuses to move the reparations issue to a more concrete stage or accept the Anglo-American view that continued discussion is futile without resolving the reparations issue, the Foreign Ministers' Conference may inevitably enter a state similar to the final week of the first Foreign Ministers' Conference in 1945. At that time, China and the Western powers firmly rejected the Soviet Union's procedural objections, and Molotov presented new suggestions daily during the final week to show the world that the failure of the conference could not be attributed to the Soviet Union. Recent Soviet propaganda has begun to foreshadow the exoneration of Molotov and his delegation from responsibility for the failure of this session of the Foreign Ministers' Conference. It is noteworthy that the Soviet "Izvestia" newspaper hinted that the outcome of this session of the Foreign Ministers' Conference depends on the policies adopted by the four foreign ministers outside the conference.

### Shadow Deepens on U.S.-Soviet Relations; Difficult to Coordinate on Far East Issues

[Central News Agency, Washington, 14th, United Press] If U.S.-Soviet relations continue on their current trend and undergo a sudden, sharp shift, the "cold war" between the Soviet Union and the United States may intensify further in the coming months. People generally refer to the political, economic, and ideological rivalry between the Soviet Union and the United States worldwide as a "cold war," but this term may not fully describe the actual situation. Recent developments have led responsible officials here to fear that U.S.-Soviet relations may soon become increasingly strained in the three areas of Korea, China, and Japan in the East.

The Soviet side has sharply criticized the United Nations Commission on Korea as a tool of the United States. The Commission is scheduled to fly to Seoul in early January next year. It is rumored that if the Soviet Union refuses it entry into North Korea, the Commission will carry out its mission in South Korea. U.S. officials apparently believe that the government established in South Korea will have the strength to withstand the unification struggle with North Korea in the future. On the other hand, the Soviet Union also apparently believes that the communist forces it has cultivated can govern all of Korea after all U.S. and Soviet troops withdraw, regardless of who is right, who wins, or what the outcome is. Many responsible figures here ultimately fear that U.S.-Soviet relations will worsen. The U.S. Congress, controlled by the Republican Party, intends to ensure that China receives substantial economic aid to help the National Government resist communism. This sentiment can also be expected to be another factor contributing to further strain in U.S.-Soviet relations. As for Japan, the points of contention between the U.S. and the Soviet Union are how to sign a peace treaty with Japan and how to control Japan. In short, as the shadow of the conflict between the two countries on general world issues deepens, the tension in their relations in the Far East will also intensify.

### Anglo-American Agreement on German Territory to Be Announced This Week

[Reuters, Washington, 14th] It is reported that the Anglo-American agreement on financial and economic policies for the Anglo-American merged zone in Germany, which was recently concluded in Washington, may be announced simultaneously in Washington and London on Wednesday or Thursday.

### U.S. Aid to Greece Achieves Results

[United Press, Athens, 13th] The U.S. Aid to Greece mission released its five-month progress report today, stating that the aid plan has saved Greece from disaster, but time is still needed to improve the precarious situation and economic situation.

### U.S. Government Considers Appropriate Measures to Safeguard Italy's Independence and Freedom; Last Batch of U.S. Troops Withdraw from Italy Yesterday

[Our Report] London, 14th Broadcast: Rome Report, the last batch of U.S. troops stationed in Italy returned home today aboard the transport ship "Admiral Sims", nine hours earlier than the withdrawal deadline stipulated in the peace treaty. At present, according to the treaty, only a small number of British and American registration personnel and winding-up personnel remain in Rome, but they are not performing occupation tasks.

[Reuters, Washington, 13th] President Truman issued a statement today regarding the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Italy, stating that although U.S. troops will soon be completely withdrawn from Italy, the United States will still consider appropriate measures to prevent Italy's independence from being threatened in the future and to maintain the country's peace, freedom, and independence.

Truman's statement said, "The United States, in fulfilling its obligations under the Italian peace treaty, has withdrawn its troops stationed in Italy. However, the United States continues to maintain an interest in safeguarding Italy's freedom and independence. If developments indicate that Italy's freedom and independence, as stipulated in the Italian peace treaty, are under direct or indirect threat, the United States, as a signatory to the treaty and a member of the United Nations, will have to consider appropriate steps necessary to maintain peace and security."

### Rumors of Intercepted Secret Moscow Order; Anti-Communist Movement Sweeps Through Turkey

[Central News Agency, Ankara, 13th] As the martial law in the northwestern province of Turkey is about to be lifted and U.S. military assistance is continuously flowing in, the Turkish anti-communist movement has suddenly erupted. This new movement is led by students, intellectuals, and the opposition Democratic Party, but the Turkish government remains silent. The influential non-partisan Turkish newspaper "Fatherland" recently published a report stating that the Turkish government has obtained special instructions from Moscow for its agents in Turkey. It is claimed that the main points are to use money to buy off agitators, hoping to stimulate public sentiment throughout Turkey so that people cannot clearly distinguish right from wrong," and then foment civil war. The newspaper also urged the Turkish government to publish this secret order.

### French Government Takes a Hard Line; Resolutely Rejects Soviet Union's Repeated Protests; Head of Soviet Diaspora Group Also Detained

[Reuters, Paris, 13th] Franco-Soviet relations deteriorated further today. The Soviet Embassy in Paris sent two strong protests to the French government yesterday and today, demanding the immediate release of Soviet citizens arrested in France, but the French Foreign Ministry resolutely rejected them. Since the French authorities took over the Soviet diaspora group near Paris last month, the French authorities have arrested 32 Soviet citizens, who have been or will be deported. Twelve of them are members of the Soviet diaspora group. The French authorities ordered them to leave France on December 9, but seven of the twelve did not comply and were detained by the French authorities along with Colonel Filatov, the head of the diaspora group, and will soon be deported. Abramov, the Soviet Chargé d'Affaires in France, submitted a second protest to the French Foreign Ministry today. After the protest, Starlykov, First Secretary of the Soviet Embassy, said that at least four more Soviet citizens were arrested in the Paris area yesterday, including the former head of the Soviet diaspora group in the United States, Konochenko, a member of the diaspora group, and two drivers. Starlykov also said: The French authorities continue to abuse arrests of Soviet citizens on unreasonable pretexts. These actions can only arouse the deepest indignation of the Soviet Embassy.

### Soviet Union Abolishes Rationing System; Issues New Currency; Extremely Strict Restrictions on Currency Exchange

[Our Report] London, 14th Broadcast: Moscow Radio announced that the Soviet Union has decided to issue new currency to replace the existing currency and will abolish the rationing system. It is said that the reason for issuing the new currency is that during the war, the German army issued many counterfeit ruble currencies, causing prices to rise tenfold to fifteenfold. However, people are subject to various restrictions when exchanging new currency, with the aim of preventing profiteering and strengthening the economic foundation of the Soviet Union.

### Italian Parliament Approves Government's Anti-Strike Measures; Communist Motion Defeated

[United Press, Rome, 13th] The National Assembly approved the government's measures against the Communist-led general strike in Rome on the 13th.

### American Democracy and Freedom Can No Longer Be Fully Guaranteed: Eleanor Roosevelt's Words

[Our Report] London, 14th Broadcast: Geneva Report, Eleanor Roosevelt told a press conference today that the United States is now adopting "some oppressive measures," which indicates that the United States cannot fully guarantee the freedom of democracy. She believes that the United States is not currently focusing its efforts on actively developing its internal strength. Mrs. Roosevelt added that in the past, Americans were free to hold their political views, but were not allowed to advocate the overthrow of the government. She is not sure whether the situation has changed now. She expects that the representatives of the United States and the Soviet Union will be able to reach a consensus here to issue a declaration on the protection of human rights and establish a binding agreement.

### Money Cannot Stop Soviet Aggression

Remarks by a Republican Senator

### Construction of Oil Pool in Donggou Town; Zhong Yuliang Asks for Speedy Demolition and Relocation

[Our Report] During Zhang Qun's tenure as mayor, the area of the oil pool in the city was determined to be Jiangkou Laoshusha after long-term discussions with local gentry. No other areas may build oil pools, and those that have already been built must be ordered to relocate.

### Garbage Contractors Seeking Advantage, Illegally Dumping at Wangjiadu; Shanghai Dredging Bureau Requests Crackdown

The city has a dense population, and daily garbage production is no less than several thousand tons. If not properly disposed of, it will not only affect public health, but also affect the navigation of the Huangpu River. In order to prevent garbage contractors from arbitrarily dumping garbage into the Huangpu River and hindering the current, the Shanghai Dredging Bureau previously obtained the consent of the Health Bureau to set up a garbage dump at Longhua Mouth, Yangsi Port, and erected signs along the dredging line for identification. Since its implementation, it has achieved temporary results. Recently, the Jianghai Customs Port Police Department discovered that all garbage boats did not sail to the above-mentioned designated locations, but gathered near Wangjiadu River Dun Port and Xinjing Port in Shanghai to dump garbage, which has been confirmed by the Dredging Bureau's dispatched personnel. The Bureau believes that garbage contractors are not only failing to move garbage from outside the boundary to inside the boundary, but are deliberately seeking advantage by dumping at Wangjiadu in order to avoid scrutiny. If no action is taken, the garbage will be washed into the center of the river along the coast with the tide, blocking the waterway, affecting water quality and cleanliness, and seriously affecting public health. The Bureau further believes that dredging the Huangpu River is to maintain the waterway, and to achieve this task, it relies on the cooperation of all parties. The Bureau has sent a letter to the Health Bureau at the end of last week regarding the above-mentioned facts.

### Seven Measures for Year-End Bonuses; General Labor Union Requests Maintenance of Original Proposal; Petition to the Municipal Government and Social Bureau Tomorrow

Regarding the issue of year-end bonuses for workers this year, seven measures were passed by the Municipal Government meeting last week, generally stipulating that the bonus amount should be one month's salary, and if the employer cannot afford it, it may be shortened. The labor side agrees with some parts of these measures, but expresses disagreement with the stipulated staggered payment and the measure of being able to reduce it appropriately in January. The General Labor Union is currently holding a meeting to discuss practical measures. However, the Industrial Association also opposes the Municipal Government's resolution, expressing disagreement with the issuance of year-end bonuses, which has caused great indignation among colleagues in the labor community. At the temporary meeting convened by the General Labor Union yesterday morning, it was resolved that the reasons are insufficient, and that at this time of national mobilization to suppress the rebellion, social needs must be stable. Now that a precedent has been set, it cannot be overturned by the opinions of a few people. The following three measures were unanimously adopted: The entire Standing Council will be delegated to go to the Municipal Government and Social Bureau at 10 am on the 16th to request the maintenance and earnest implementation of the original proposal, and the consent of the labor side must be obtained for the staggered payment and reduction measures. Regularly invite reporters. The points made by the Industrial Association are inconsistent with the facts and will be publicly stated on a regular basis. After the case was discussed, and regarding the case of Yang Zhao, Chairman of the Rubber Industry Union in the Fourth District, who was inexplicably threatened by hooligans, it was decided to delegate Standing Council members Gui Fusheng, Qiu Changjiang, and Council member Zhou Yunjiang to investigate the truth and report it to the competent authorities for severe punishment.

The original complaint stated that the plaintiff had worked as an accountant at the Overseas Chinese Company, and due to business relations, she and Nie met day and night. However, the defendant falsely claimed that he had no wife and was willing to marry the plaintiff as his wife. If she did not agree to his request, he threatened to close the business. The plaintiff, a weak woman, was weak-willed and feared losing her job, so she submitted to fornication. The defendant, having achieved his purpose, became tired of her over time and was stingy with living expenses. At around 9 pm on the 9th of last month, when she asked the defendant for living expenses, she was unexpectedly beaten and kicked by the defendant at the entrance of Ciyin Lane, Ximo Road, causing the plaintiff to suffer a concussion, and injuries to her right arm, chest, both legs, etc. Li Shouli and Mrs. Shen can testify.

Please investigate according to the law, it says. The prosecutor has opened the case several times, but the defendant has repeatedly failed to appear despite being summoned.

At 10 am, the Jiangya steamship set sail from the third wharf of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company (Jinlihan Wharf). Pan Gongzhan, Xu Jishun, Xu Xueyu, and others accompanied the ship and warmly received these distant guests from the high mountains and deserts of the Northwest. All the men and women of the song and dance troupe were extremely excited. Most of them had never boarded a steamship before and had no sailing experience, so they expressed great interest in this water trip. The Jiangya steamship is a new and excellent commercial steamship in our country. Yesterday, Xu Xueyu, General Manager of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, personally led the troupe to visit various facilities on the ship and explained them in detail. At around 12 noon, they had lunch on the ship. Senator Zhang Yiqu composed a poem on the spot, with the lines "Meeting by chance like old friends, Wishing Xinjiang well," to express his welcome. After the meal, a song and dance performance was held, with performances by the troupe and the coming reality. At 1 pm, after arriving at the river near Chongming, they stopped briefly. The wind was calm, the sea and sky were the same color. The members of the troupe scrambled to board the deck to look into the distance, and occasionally played musical instruments in the breeze. The Jiangya steamship returned to Shanghai at 1:10 pm and returned to Shanghai at 4 pm. They went with excitement and returned with joy. Kangbarhan, the flower of the Uyghur people, expressed special satisfaction, believing that in terms of personal experience, she gained a new understanding of "riding the wind and waves."

Kangbarhan Talks About Her Impressions of This Trip

[Also reported] Miss Kangbarhan, the "Flower of the Uyghur People," at the request of reporters on the Jiangya steamship, expressed her impressions of this trip, saying that in the past, ethnic minority compatriots in the border areas had little contact with inland culture, and the people in the border areas had mixed good and bad imaginations of the inland. Since the central government cared about Xinjiang and specially sent General Zhang Zhizhong to govern Xinjiang, the relationship between the border province and the central government has been strengthened. General Zhang's wise and resolute governance has further increased the faith of the people in the border areas in the central government. Therefore, we often hope to visit the inland. I am deeply gratified to be able to visit the mainland this time under the leadership of General Zhang Zhizhong. She continued that the troupe has been warmly welcomed by inland compatriots in Beijing and Shanghai, which fully reveals the feelings of inland compatriots, and they feel very happy. As for what she is most interested in in Shanghai, it is movies, singing, and dramas. Finally, she said that the troupe's dance can only represent the life and customs of the ethnic minorities in the border areas. She hopes to have the opportunity to learn more in Shanghai and to reduce the impact.

Xinjiang Song and Dance Troupe Broadcasts on the Air

Also, the New Youth Song and Dance Troupe, at the invitation of the Shanghai Broadcasting Station in this city, will go to the station to broadcast on the air from 7:45 pm to 8:45 pm today.

### Inheritance Tax Dispute After the Death of Xiao Dangui

Shaoxing Direct Tax Branch Sends Letter to Local Court to Investigate Information

[Report from Our Newspaper] After Xiao Dangui's suicide, her inheritance will be subject to inheritance tax by the Direct Tax Bureau. However, both the Shanghai Direct Tax Bureau and the Shaoxing Branch of the Direct Tax Bureau intend to carry out the collection procedures. The Shanghai Direct Tax Bureau has sent personnel to investigate the exact amount of Xiao's inheritance. At the same time, the Shaoxing Branch of the Direct Tax Bureau also sent a letter to the local court of this city, entrusting it to check and reply on relevant information. The official letter from the Shaoxing Branch of the Direct Tax Bureau is recorded as follows: In order to inquire about the quantity of Qian Chunfeng's inheritance in Shanghai and related information, and to determine who is the designated legal administrator, the Jingxian Tax Collection Office reported: "It has been found that Qian Chunfeng (Yueling Xiao Dangui) committed suicide by taking poison in Shanghai on October 23 this year. Qian Chunfeng is a native of Changle Town in the jurisdiction of this office. After her suicide, she left a huge amount of property, which should be declared by the legal heir Qian Boquan in accordance with the law regarding the fact of death and the status of property in order to levy inheritance tax. In addition to the part of the real estate in Changle, he has been ordered to fill out the report. There are many houses, real estate, and movable properties in Shanghai and Hangzhou. Please check with the relevant agencies in the above-mentioned two places for verification and inform them to facilitate simultaneous taxation." According to this, Article 16 of the Inheritance Tax Law stipulates: "If the deceased has property that should be taxed in accordance with this law, the taxpayer, inheritance administrator, or will executor shall report the fact of death and the list of inheritance to the local inheritance tax collection agency within two months from the date of the commencement of the inheritance." Now it has been found that one and a half months have passed since Qian Baifeng's death, and the person receiving the inheritance should be notified to declare in accordance with the law for verification and taxation. However, the case of Zhang Chunfan, a person involved in the case, has been investigated and sued by the Shanghai District Court Prosecutor's Office, and he obviously has no right to inherit the inheritance. Also, the Shanghai newspaper on November 14 carried a piece of news that a part of Qian Chunfeng's inheritance in Shanghai had been taken back to Changle Town, Sheng County, by her brother Qian Boquan, and it was stated that the lawyer Mao Xianren proved it and a contract was signed at that time. As for the actual situation, the Benyi Sheng County Tax Collection Office has been ordered to investigate it. In addition to the part of the inheritance in Hangzhou, which has been sent to the Hangzhou Direct Tax Bureau for verification, the amount of inheritance in Shanghai and related information are available for inspection in your court. Please grant an inquiry and reply.

### Important Institution for Directing Flight - Air Traffic Control Station - Movements of Any Aircraft Completely Clear - Any Kind of Aerial Incident Immediately Detected

[Special Report from this Newspaper] In Nanhua Airport, there is a small bungalow. Inside, there are machines and radio communication tools. The walls are covered with maps and record boards. Ten young men in Air Force uniforms are busy working. This small room, these few dozen workers, control the entire flight traffic in Chinese airspace. They are completely aware of the movement and location of any aircraft. They can immediately detect any possible aerial incident. This small but important institution is the Air Traffic Control Station of the Civil Aviation Administration of the Ministry of Transportation.

Air traffic control is still a nascent field in China, a term unfamiliar to most. However, with the increasing development of the aviation industry, the arrival of the aviation age is rapid and inevitable. Therefore, the importance of air traffic control is as indispensable as traffic lights controlling traffic on Nanjing Road today.

What exactly is air traffic control? Taking Nanhua Airport as an example, any aircraft flying out must first fill out a flight plan form and submit it to the control station for review. The plan should include details such as aircraft type, aircraft number, pilot and radio operator names, radio equipment type, flight route, estimated departure time, estimated flight time, fuel load, alternate airport, and other information.

Observing Weather Conditions in Various Locations - Deciding Whether to Take Off

The control station reviews the plan in detail, paying particular attention to the fuel load and alternate airport. Generally, an aircraft's fuel load must be sufficient to fly to its destination and, in case it cannot land there, to fly to the alternate airport, with an additional hour's worth of fuel as a reserve for unforeseen circumstances.

After all items on the plan have passed inspection, the weather conditions for flying are considered. The control station obtains weather information from two sources: weather reports provided every half hour by central meteorological stations across the country and local meteorological stations of the China National Aviation Corporation; and weather forecasts provided four times a day by the US Naval Meteorological Station (part of which was the former Sino-American Cooperative Organization meteorological station), including wind direction, cloud height, visibility, and other data. The control station conducts a comprehensive observation of the weather conditions along the aircraft's flight route, and decides whether the aircraft can fly according to established standards.

Flight Permit Contains Various Instructions

When everything is "OK", the control station issues a flight permit, and the aircraft can take off. The flight permit also specifies necessary instructions, such as the altitude to fly at or where to pass a certain aircraft. The permit is not given directly to the pilot, but to the control tower at the airport for radio transmission.

The control tower is responsible for flights within a three-mile radius, using radio to instruct aircraft on how to take off, how to avoid danger, and transmit the instructions from the permit to the pilot via radio. The pilot must repeat the instructions to avoid errors.

Once the aircraft has taken off and left the control tower's area of control, it must contact the "Approach Control", located in Jiangwan. Currently, due to temporary measures, it is operated by the US military, and its control area extends to fifty miles. Within this area, all aircraft must be under its direction.

Position Clearly Displayed on Maps and Record Boards

Beyond the fifty-mile radius is the Shanghai Area. The pilot proceeds toward the destination according to the instructions of the control station, sending telegrams to radio stations to report the flight position and weather conditions en route. After passing each station, a telegram must be sent to report the departure time and estimated time of arrival at the next station. Upon receiving this report, the Civil Aviation Bureau's radio station immediately notifies the control station by telegraph or other rapid means. The duty personnel at the control station note this on the record board. If an aircraft exceeds a reasonable amount of time without sending a telegram, it may have encountered an incident. Based on the last reported position, the control station can estimate the approximate location of the accident and take necessary measures.

The above description is based on aircraft flying out of Shanghai. Conversely, the situation is entirely similar for aircraft flying in from various locations. Therefore, the records and maps at the control station can indicate the airspace in which a particular aircraft is flying at any time, and the number of aircraft flying in the airspace over China at any given moment.

Most Staff Members Have Interned in the United States for an Extended Period

Currently, the only established air traffic control station is in Shanghai. The Civil Aviation Administration originally planned to establish eight stations in Shanghai, Hankou, Guangzhou, Beiping, Xi'an, Kunming, Chongqing, and Guiyang, but due to a lack of equipment, the latter four stations had to be temporarily suspended. The control stations in Hankou, Guangzhou, and Beiping are expected to be established within the near future.

The Shanghai station currently has twenty-eight air traffic control personnel, most of whom are Air Force personnel who have interned at the US Civil Aeronautics Administration for an extended period. The rest are engineering graduates from Jiaotong University, Tsinghua University, and other institutions. They are currently establishing an air traffic control training class at Hongqiao Airport to train more specialized personnel to undertake this important task. It is hoped that with their efforts, we will never again hear or see the tragedy of an aerial accident!

[Report from our Wuxi Office, 13th] Sun Jiugui, from Zhangjiazhuang Village, Bazhuang Township, 13th District, Yancheng, Northern Jiangsu, currently serves as the Foreign Affairs Director of the bandit army's cooperative.

However, they were discovered by the treacherous bandit Sun Jiugui and others, who led their troops to attempt to kill them. Fortunately, the Suns were alert and fled in the night, returning to Wuxi. Their mother (who is seventy years old) was unfortunately subjected to brutal torture by the bandit army, leaving her with numerous scars. At the same time, the bandit criminal Sun Jiugui and his brother led their henchmen Zhu Baoyu, Zhu Baocai, Zhu Baoxiang, Ling Fengqi, Zhu Songhua, and others to murder villager Zhu Yindong and extorted 30 dan of rice from Zhu's wife, Sun. On the 12th of this month, the treacherous bandit Sun Jiugui, due to a shortage of military supplies for the bandit army, chartered a boat from Jiangbei, which sailed from Yancheng to Wuxi and docked at the Wuqiao River. This was discovered by the victims Sun Mingzheng and others, who reported it to the criminal police team. They went to arrest him, and on the 13th, he was escorted to the police headquarters. After questioning by Section Chief Zhang of the Judicial Section, Sun confessed to the above atrocities without denial. He was ordered to be detained for strict investigation.

Zhu Mingxun escaped danger and returned to Cheng on the 11th. The police station had already received a report, but fearing for the hostage's life, they did not make it public. They are now devising ways to hunt down the criminals. It is also rumored that the Xicheng Company was extorted for 50 million by bandits. The victim, fearing retaliation, has not made a public statement.

We must have three critical standards when discussing the Renaissance today: 1. National culture must be full of creative vitality and seek its cultural roots; 2. National culture must have the spirit of the times and pay attention to cultural exchange; 3. Select excellent culture as its core value and spread it abroad, as part of the legacy of world culture. Subsequently, Li Ximou, the acting director of the Municipal Education Bureau, and Chief Wu, the representative of the Social Affairs Bureau, delivered speeches.

Matters Resolved

### Ordnance Automobile Fought Vigorously but Lost to Dagon: 67 to 57, a Difference of Ten Points

[Our Newspaper] After arriving in Shanghai, the basketball team of the 16th Ordnance Automobile Regiment won three games, defeating Ren Ji Xu Shan Qingbai. Last night, they encountered their first strong opponent and were defeated by the new army Dagon team by 67 to 57, losing by ten points. In the first half, Dagon led with 29 to 17. Dagon assembled the elite of the crowd and Zheng Han, and its appeal was very strong. The competition between the two sides was extremely fierce, with non-stop fierce battles from beginning to end, but in terms of excitement, it was still difficult to satisfy.

The visiting army was inevitably flustered in the face of a strong enemy. At the beginning of the game, Ti Hang, Cao Zhiji, and Zheng Dagang missed four consecutive free throws, resulting in huge losses. Therefore, Wen Huazhongqiang and Huang Boling scored one after another, taking a 6-2 and 8-3 lead. The visiting army chased to 7-8 and 10-3. Dagon's performance was awkward and lacked tacit understanding. Cai Wenzhang replaced Cai Zhongqiang, and Dagon sent a smooth journey, scoring 16 consecutive points, making it 29-12, which laid the foundation for victory. The first half ended 29-17.

In the second half, the Ordnance Automobile Regiment switched to man-to-man defense, and the defense improved greatly. The strength was still abundant, and they were unyielding. Dagon's vigor was frustrated, and the situation became more balanced, with both sides scoring points. In the last four minutes, Kui Wenhua was fouled out, and the score was 61-50. The Ordnance Automobile Regiment continued its efforts and chased to 63-57, only six points behind. Unfortunately, they fell short of success because time had run out. Zhongqiang and Wenlong scored another four points, resulting in a final score of 67-57. Although the Ordnance Automobile Regiment lost, it was indeed not easy.

In the end, Xinhua won the first victory of the finals by one valuable point, 25 to 24, over Industrial and Mining.

### Basketball Committee Donates 25 Million Yuan to the Sports Reporters Association

[Our Newspaper] Although the ticket prices for last night's basketball game between the 16th Ordnance Automobile Regiment and Dagon were raised to 50,000 yuan and 30,000 yuan, the Municipal Gymnasium was still packed. It is estimated that there were three to four thousand people. However, according to the announcement of the Basketball Committee: only 1,326 tickets for 50,000 yuan downstairs and 500 tickets for 30,000 yuan upstairs were sold, totaling 81.3 million yuan.

### Official Exchange Rate Far from Black Market Rate; Overseas Remittance Income Still Shows No Improvement

[Our Newspaper] Currently, overseas remittance income still shows no improvement due to the large difference between the official exchange rate and the black market rate. According to estimates by relevant sources, before the war, China's annual overseas remittance income could be converted to US$300 million. However, at that time, there were no restrictions on international remittances. The situation has changed dramatically after the war, and many countries have foreign exchange controls. For example, Singapore stipulates that each person's monthly overseas remittance shall not exceed 45 Singapore dollars. Other parts of Southeast Asia also have similar restrictions. According to official estimates, it can still reach approximately US$100 million per year, but due to losses from smuggling, the actual income of the country is far less than this amount.

Sixth District Cotton Spinning Association Hosts Banquet for Director of Textile Adjustment Committee

[Our Newspaper] On the evening of the 13th, the Sixth District Cotton Spinning Association hosted a banquet for Yuan Liang, Director of the Textile Adjustment Committee, and the directors and deputy directors of the committee. All members of the Sixth District Association attended. It is reported that Director Tang Shangyuan briefly reported on the outline of the draft of the flower yarn and cloth management implementation plan that had been completed. The general principle is still to purchase national cotton in a unified manner and distribute it to various factories for processing and weaving, and then sell it in a unified manner. After Director Yuan finished his report, the members of the Sixth District Association expressed their opinions on the main points that had been reported, and Director Yuan expressed his willingness to accept them for consideration. It is said that the draft of the implementation plan will be personally presented to Beijing for review by Yuan himself in the coming days.

Hangzhou's Monetary Market Is Extremely Tight; Commodity Prices Are Expected to Return to Normal

[Our Newspaper, Hangzhou, 14th Dispatch] Since the issuance of the Gold Yuan, commodity prices in Hangzhou have also fluctuated. The list price of No. 1 rice is 780,000 yuan, and 1.36 million yuan for twelve pounds of Longtou fine cloth. However, the monetary market has been extremely tight recently. On the 13th, the China Trust Bureau threw out 14 billion yuan of rayon, totaling about 20 billion yuan including the amount due, and could not balance it out until 9:00 p.m. According to people familiar with the financial community, the monetary market is still extremely tight, so commodity prices in Hangzhou are expected to be slightly lower.

Stopping Remittances to Other Ports Affects the Business of Cigarette Factories

After the government recently issued a new order to stop remittances to other ports, the cigarette factories have suffered a lot of losses as a result. This is because most of the cigarette factories in this city focus on business in other ports, and raw materials must also be transported from other ports. The receipt and payment of goods must rely on remittances. Now that the government wants to stop remittances to other ports, it will inevitably put the factories in a state of contraction or stagnation. The Cigarette Factory Association, keenly aware of the real situation of its members, decided to submit a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce through the board of directors to appeal to the Ministry of Finance to improve this measure.

### The Cigarette Market Is Weak

Yesterday, the cigarette market opened in the morning because the colleagues' monetary market was still tight, and it was rumored that the authorities would inspect the warehouse, and people's minds were weak. There were still many resales in the market, and the market was low. By the time of the midday closing, someone was searching for low prices, and as a result, ten large British and Lao Dao cigarettes were reduced by a small amount of 500,000 yuan each. The remaining Beautiful Golden Mouse Brandy and 20 Big Three Cannon Qianmen, etc., were each reduced by 1,000 to 3,000 yuan. However, after the closing, scattered households outside the market absorbed ten large British cigarettes, and the transaction was completed at a price of 200,000 yuan above the list price. Lao Dao was also 100,000 yuan more expensive, and the owner was willing to sell.

### Japanese Goods in Hong Kong Are Gradually Becoming Active; Woolen Cloth Is the Most Popular; The Price of Glass Is Also Low

[Hong Kong News] Since the United Kingdom and Japan officially resumed trade in November, Hong Kong's trade with Japan, although still controlled by the governments of both places, has recently shown significant development compared to before. Private trade has been widely launched, and some commercial firms have begun to accept contracts for ordering Japanese goods. After the procedures are completed by both parties and approved by the Allied Headquarters stationed in Japan through the Industrial and Commercial Supply Office, Japanese goods can be transported from Japan to Hong Kong. Under this situation, imported Japanese goods can also obtain foreign exchange supply from the government.

Currently, the goods that can be publicly accepted for orders include cotton textiles, woolen fabrics, various woven materials, silk fabrics, Fuji silk, printed silk, paper, various miscellaneous goods and toys, chemical dyes, chemical products, glass, porcelain, stationery, fountain pens, pencils, slide rules, seafood, etc. The types are extremely complex. The samples of the above-mentioned commodities are complete and have fixed prices. Among them, the best-selling goods in Hong Kong recently are various woolen fabrics. There are as many as eighty styles, and the quality is acceptable. The better ones are sold as British goods. The price is only 13 Hong Kong dollars per yard, which is double width, so it is very popular. Those who arrive in time have a profit of three or four cents. The next lowest price and cost-effective is glass. Because the current price of Japanese goods is still stipulated by the Allied Headquarters stationed in Japan in US dollars, and is determined based on market prices around the world, and the Japanese goods that can be ordered for export cannot be suitable for export, and the surge in arrivals has caused the previous orders to be discounted immediately. For example, not long ago, a batch of pencils arrived in Hong Kong. When the order was placed, the price of pencils in Hong Kong was 20 yuan per box. After the batch of Japanese goods arrived in Hong Kong, the price plummeted. Now it has fallen to 5 yuan per box, and it is still difficult to sell. The losses suffered by merchants can be seen from this. Therefore, although various Japanese goods can be ordered at will in Hong Kong, general merchants are unwilling to order in large quantities. Among them, many buy spot goods rather than order futures, because they are afraid that a large number of spot goods may arrive at any time after ordering futures, and there are many doubts about Japanese goods. In order to avoid unexpected losses, they have to adopt this policy.

Recently, Sir Sassoon, who arrived in Hong Kong, expressed his opinions on the future of Hong Kong's foreign trade as a whole: "Hong Kong has taken the place of Shanghai after the war, and China's chaos has also promoted Hong Kong's prosperity. Chinese are constantly coming to Hong Kong from the north, and their attention and investment in Hong Kong are now in full swing. Hong Kong has become the main entrepot port in the Far East, and all opportunities are very unique. In the two years after the war, the progress of Hong Kong's trade with the Far East and the West Pacific has been quite amazing. Just look at the numbers of import and export ships and air traffic to see the proof. Not only that, under the current situation in China, British, American, and overseas Chinese capital will gradually move south, and Guangdong and neighboring provinces will inevitably prosper, and Hong Kong will also benefit a lot."

### 70 Million US Dollar Loan for American Cotton Is Still Under Negotiation; National Bank Advisor Yang Ge Has Flown to the US from Shanghai

[Our Newspaper] It is rumored that the US$70 million US cotton loan is nearing completion. The reporter inquired from relevant parties. It is learned that the cotton loan is still under negotiation and is being handled by the US Export-Import Bank. However, the case still needs to be finally approved by the US State Department before it can be approved. The general perception is that the hope is strong. The term of the loan is not long, and it is stipulated that China will import loaned American cotton. After producing and exporting textiles, the resulting US foreign exchange will be used to repay in installments. It is reported that Dr. Yang Ge, Advisor to the Central Bank, flew to the US from Shanghai on the 12th, which is not unrelated to the negotiation of the US cotton loan.

### Soap Prices Ease Outside the Market

Yesterday, the soap market for daily necessities opened. Sales on this street were still active, and retailers were still interested, so prices were still good. Later, because of the high prices, people took the opportunity to sell, and the market softened. Finally, the listed price of Gu Ben soap was 990,000 yuan, while the market price was 30,000 to 40,000 yuan lower than the previous day. Arrow Knife soap was sold for 1,070,000 yuan, Huang Xiangmao for 750,000 yuan, and Bull Brand Henry for 880,000 yuan. Someone bought it. Guanghua soap traded for 780,000-90,000 yuan. Matches were firm, and foreign candles fell slightly by 10,000 yuan.

### Tax on Xuzhou Cured Tobacco Leaves Adjusted Again

The Shanghai Goods Tax Bureau of the Ministry of Finance received a telegram from the Goods Tax Department that the amount of tobacco leaf tax in the fourth phase of the Henan region has been adjusted for the second time to 1,145,000 yuan for Grade A, 873,000 yuan for Grade B, and 545,000 yuan for Grade C. Subsequently, the Shanghai District Tax Bureau will levy a supplementary tax on Xuzhou tobacco leaves based on the Grade A tax amount of 1,145,000 yuan in the region. It is hereby announced that the second Xuzhou tobacco leaf tax for the fourth phase of this year will be re-levied from December 11. The tax amount for Grade A Xuzhou tobacco leaves will be adjusted from 793,000 yuan to 1,145,000 yuan per 100 market catties. It is noted that the first adjustment of the tax amount for the fourth phase of this year was implemented on November 25. The tax amount for Xuzhou was adjusted from 640,000 yuan to 793,000 yuan per 100 market catties, Xiangyang leaves were adjusted from 315,000 yuan to 429,000 yuan, and Qingzhou was adjusted from 500,000 yuan to 722,000 yuan. Within 15 days, the tax amount for Grade A Xuzhou leaves was adjusted from 640,000 yuan to 1,145,000 yuan, a difference of 500,000 yuan per 100 market catties.

### Expansion of Wool Quota; Notice Has Not Been Issued Yet

[Our Newspaper] It is reported that relevant agencies believe that the current import quota for wool is too small, only accounting for 15% of the actual needs. Therefore, they have decided to take 1.5 million US dollars of wool from the goods arriving at the port with self-provided foreign exchange to add to the original import quota of 2 million US dollars per quarter. However, although this matter has been decided, the official notice has not yet been issued. People in the industry told reporters: The foreign price of wool has not fluctuated at present, because the wool produced in Australia is mainly supplied to the motherland, but the United Kingdom is currently tightening its belt and struggling to overcome difficulties, so the demand is minimal. Moreover, it is currently the wool harvesting season, and the supply is the largest, so the price is stable. However, in the long term, the price will become more expensive because the production of Australian wool is less after the war than before the war.

### Regulations Supplementing the Substitution of Gauze for Printed Cotton

The Textile Export Committee, in the past, stipulated that printed cotton could be substituted for gauze, with a conversion rate of "1130 pounds of printed cotton for one piece of 20-count yarn or 24 bolts of 10-pound fine cloth." This calculation was based on L.S.S. printed cotton as the standard. However, there are many types of printed cotton, and the name is not limited to this one. The quality varies, and from a trade standpoint, it is inconvenient to have rigid regulations. Now, to promote the export of gauze, facilitate international trade, and reduce all difficulties in transactions, a flexible standard is adopted. In the future, if manufacturers use gauze to substitute for printed cotton, and the grade is higher or lower than the L.S.S. standard, the conversion rate can be freely determined by both parties. However, it must be approved by the committee to inform the Export-Import Control Board for the issuance of export-import licenses.

### Sharp Decline in Northeast Coal Production

[Via Yang Hang News] In May of this year, the total monthly coal production from the seven mines in Fushun, Zao Xin, Benxi, Yantai, Beipiao, Yingchengzi, and Xi'an exceeded 400,000 tons. After the Communist bandits launched five offensives, in August, the five mines in Fushun, Fuxin, Benxi, Yantai, and Yingchengzi were still able to maintain a total monthly production of 300,000 tons. Currently, only Fushun, Yantai, and Benxi are producing, with a total monthly production of only about 150,000 tons, a decrease of 250,000 tons compared to May.

### Silk Weaving Industry Orders Italian Rayon Over 4,000 Cases to Arrive in Shanghai Soon as Third Quarter Quota Import Goods

According to sources from the Silk Weaving Industry Association, over 4,000 cases of Italian rayon will arrive in Shanghai soon. This rayon is a quota import commodity for the third quarter and was ordered by the silk weaving industry. The industry will allocate it according to the actual needs of each factory. It is reported that since the war, the industry has largely relied on the allocation of rayon from the China National Trust Corporation's barter trade with Japan, but the supply has been intermittent and the quantity insufficient. The Export-Import Control Board has included rayon in the import quota starting from the third quarter, with a prescribed amount of US$565,000. The remainder is distributed by the industry and rayon merchants. Furthermore, this order of Italian rayon is one of the largest since the war, with only small quantities imported in the past.

Scientific Weekly [L]

### The Improvement and Popularization of Science

— Pingxi

When people talk about the backwardness of Chinese culture or the slow progress of society, they invariably cite the underdevelopment and inadequate level of science in China as a reason. In fact, it should be said that this is because Chinese science has not been improved or popularized.

Regarding the demand for scientific knowledge in the great cause of national reconstruction, improvement and popularization are two broad avenues that cannot be neglected. We cannot only hope for the improvement of science or only expect the popularization of science, but must simultaneously complete this urgent task from both aspects to solve the problem.

The improvement of science emphasizes the cultivation of specialized talent and the training of special skills, while the popularization of science strives to permeate general scientific knowledge into the daily lives of the people. The improvement of science is not only a national honor but also a contribution to global academia. The popularization of science seems to have little connection with other countries, but in order to improve the national knowledge level and understand the indivisible significance of world culture, there are reasons why it must be vigorously pursued. Between these two, there should be no distinction between priority, no comparison of urgency, and no selection of importance. They must both be proposed and given equal attention.

It has been almost thirty years since the May Fourth Movement, and the call for "science" has been shouted loudly, but the results are unsatisfactory. Speaking of improvement, what important inventions or discoveries have we contributed to the world? Speaking of popularization, the majority of our people are still largely unacquainted with science. This is because the Chinese government and society have not put enough effort into science.

Although the improvement and popularization of science each has its own task and field, they are actually two sides of the same coin. Only in a country where science has been popularized can science achieve brilliant results. And only in a country where science has been improved to a considerable extent can their people universally accept the baptism of science, with no risk of disconnection and no trace of any order of priority. Therefore, the popularization and improvement of science are merely a comprehensive issue, and their degree of development is mutually coordinated.

Why can American science reach such heights? Why can they be the first to discover the great creation of "atomic energy?" It is because their level of science is high, there are many talented people, the research is deep, and scientific knowledge is very popular. In the United States, people of almost any profession and any age have a considerable scientific understanding and scientific training, and most are interested in science. Therefore, there are more people engaged in scientific work, and truth is naturally easier to discover and science naturally progresses quickly with the activities of the majority of hands and brains.

This shows that the improvement and popularization of science must go hand in hand. The higher the level, the easier the popularization. Only with popularization can there be improvement. The relationship between the two is mutually reinforcing. In the past, our country's scientific work has failed to plan for both aspects, resulting in slow progress and failure to meet the needs of the times.

In the future, to develop our country's science, improvement and popularization cannot be neglected. To cultivate highly specialized scientific talents, we must first lay a solid foundation of scientific society. To enable science to play a popularizing role among the people, we must raise the floating standard of science to a higher level. The country should spend a large amount of material and financial resources to establish advanced and perfect research institutions, but it cannot ignore the work of instilling science deep into the people. If we use most of our energy to promote the scientific knowledge of the general public, we must not forget to cultivate specialized talents. This is an educational task and even more so a responsibility of scientific workers.

### The Science of Sleep

— Yu

In the process of human life, sleep is of course the most important. A person cannot do without sleep, nor does he want to not sleep, because sleep is of great benefit and help to mankind. It can regulate the spirit, restore brainpower, and make the body and mind healthy. These are the effects of sleep, so sleep is inevitably recognized by people as a necessity.

If you are willing to experiment, you will not go to bed all night. At the time, you may not feel anything, but the next day, you will feel dizzy, sore muscles, weak limbs, and drowsy. The eyes also lose their vitality, as if something is pressing on your head. You will be listless all day long. From this, it can be seen that sleep is indispensable to human beings.

Now, let's first look at the sleep time of each person, which varies in length. Generally, children under two years old usually exceed fifteen hours, three to six years old are over ten hours, and those over six years old are about ten hours. Adults can reduce it to eight hours, and the elderly can reduce it to six hours. Five hours of sleep is sufficient for those over seventy years old. Therefore, we arrive at a conclusion that the amount of sleep time for humans is inversely proportional to age.

But why can you reduce sleep time as you get older? Then why not completely abolish it and not sleep? Theoretically, it can be established. But the reality is not so, so the question comes up: Is sleep necessary for humans?

According to Professor Mass of the University of Washington in the United States, an experiment was conducted with eight male and female students who did not sleep for sixty consecutive hours, but their work efficiency and physical health did not decrease in the slightest.

Although the above experiment cannot determine that sleep can be abolished, it can at least be inferred that sleep is a habit and not necessary for humans. Many other scientists believe that sleep is a habit developed by human ancestors, and later this habit was gradually passed on to us descendants to an unchangeable degree.

However, if we gradually reduce sleep time day by day, then one day we can stay awake all night. This is not impossible, it's just that we don't put it into practice. Above, we already know that the sleep time for adults is eight hours. If we can fall asleep as soon as we go to bed and eliminate all unnecessary wasted time, then sleep time can be reduced to six hours. Wouldn't that be two hours less than usual, but the efficacy is not less than eight hours.

Professor Hollinworth of Columbia University in the United States said that abolishing sleep is very possible. He also has a method, which is that a person who sleeps for eight hours, if they reduce it in short increments of five minutes per month, can completely eliminate it after sixteen years, because such a short time of five minutes per month is not perceived by most people to have any hindrance.

Sleep is really the greatest tragedy of mankind, because it not only deprives you of your freedom, but also wastes your most cherished and precious time. If we calculate it for a forty-year-old person, then he has abandoned ten years of good time in the land of darkness, which is not a pity, even painful.

Then how did our ancestors develop this bad habit? This is because in ancient times, science was certainly out of the question, but there was no discovery of fire, so everything had to rely on sunlight for lighting to start their work. Of course, they could not continue in the dark night, but there was nothing to do, because life was very simple at that time, so they drowsily lay down, and over time, a state of sleep was formed. They continued this state until the discovery of fire, but by that time it had become a habit that could not be changed. They did not change it because people at that time did not know that sleep was a habit, so this bad habit was passed down to the present.

Many other scientists believe that the most important thing to study in order to replace sleep is to restore the activity of brain cells. In this way, people no longer need to use sleep to restore their brainpower.

Brain cells are a complex combination mechanism, and everything in humans is dominated by it, so restoring brain cells is restoring the whole person. If we can invent a machine that, through the action of this machine, or use electric current to change brain cells and restore them to their original state, then sleep will not be needed.

By that time, the word "sleep" will become a historical relic, and life will be lengthened by half out of thin air. A three-year-old child can be sent to school to study, and a ten-year-old person will have the experience of an adult. The bed will become a place for us to rest for a while.

Editor's note: Sleep is a natural physiological phenomenon, and the restoration of fatigue depends entirely on sleep. Whether it can be avoided in the future due to the progress of science is a very interesting question, and there are some factual bases, so it is published here.

### Atomic Dry Battery

— Who

In order to cooperate with wartime applications, allied scientists devoted themselves to improving ultra-small dry batteries. The most glorious and successful is the Mini-Max dry battery of the American Carbon Company, which has extremely small volume and extremely large power.

The structure of this type of dry battery is different from ordinary ones. The positive electrode is an extremely thin carbon sheet, the negative electrode is a zinc sheet, and there is a pure steel square container containing a mixture of electrolyte and depolarizer. A group of Mini-Max batteries are stacked together and then sealed with thick wax paper into a strip, which becomes a 103-volt atomic dry battery sold on the market.

### Color Wireless Movie

— Zheng Zuoqing

Wireless movies can be said to be very common in middle and upper class families in the United States, but color wireless movies have only recently been officially and successfully produced. The American Radio Company (RCA) has therefore specially manufactured a new type of television camera to broadcast full-real natural color wireless movies. The machine is all-electronic tube equipment. The light is first focused on the photo, and then divided into three colors and captured into the lens. Scans the three colors of green at high speed. Therefore, each color can be scanned thirty times per second. The receiver then recombines the three colors into full-real natural colors. Ordinary black and white wireless movie receivers can also receive this future color movie if they are equipped with a converter, but the colors are still only black and white. Therefore, the widespread application of future color wireless movies, according to senior officials of the company, still requires considerable time.

### Talking About Wood

— Tang Yao

Hardwood also has a special type of tubular cell called "Wood Fiber." In most hardwoods, wood fiber is the main part. The function of these fibers is mainly for mechanical support. Its length averages about 1 hao (1/25 inch). The pits of wood fiber have many differences, and there can also be many specialized terms to describe it. Generally speaking, their structure is between the "tracheid" mentioned above and the "wood parenchyma" discussed below.

The wood cells mentioned above are all arranged along the longitudinal axis of the tree. There is also a type of wood cell that is a very short tubular cell called "Wood Ray Parenchyma." Their long axis is arranged along the radial direction of the wood (that is, along the direction of the cross-sectional radius). There are simple pits between their adjacent walls. These cells are still alive and mainly store food. If the cells of the parenchyma are also arranged axially, then it is called wood parenchyma (Wood Parenchyma). These two types of tissues are completely different due to the different direction of cell arrangement, but they must be distinguished clearly.

The structure of various woods can be roughly divided into two types: "softwood," which is mainly composed of tracheids. These cells perform both conduction (earlywood or springwood) and support (latewood or autumnwood). In "hardwood," the division of labor is more precise. Vessels (cross-sectionally called pores) are specially suitable for conduction, and fibers are mainly for mechanical support. As for parenchyma (including wood parenchyma and wood rays), they are mainly used to store food.

The horizontal tissues in the wood are arranged along the radial direction of the wood (that is, along the direction of the diameter on the cross-section), so the symmetry of the wood tissue is only three: 1. Cross section, refers to the surface perpendicular to the main trunk or central axis; 2. Radial section, refers to the section that can contain the pith (Pith) in the center of the wood; 3. Tangential section, refers to the section that is perpendicular to the growth ring or parallel to the pith. Since the various cells in the wood are three-dimensional, in order to observe the structure of any kind of wood and see the longitudinal, transverse, and high aspects of the cell wall, it is necessary to combine the results obtained from the three aspects of the wood, including cross-cutting and longitudinal cutting (including radial cutting and chord cutting), to obtain the whole picture. The wood rays arranged radially, when viewed on the cross-section of the wood, are radial. If the bark is peeled off, you can sometimes see the height of these lines. On the radial cut (that is, sawing open along the center of the wood section), there are many collections of band-like cells (Tibbon-like). When viewed on the cross-section of the tubular cells, only the cross-surface of these tubes is seen, along with the radial wall and tangential wall (because the cut part is different, the size of the same cell can be different on the cross-section). It is necessary to combine the radial and chordal sections to understand the structure of the entire cell wall.

The method of sawing wood sections can be roughly divided into two types: 1. Plain-sawn (Flator slash sawn oi glat grain, refers to sawing the chord surface of the wood section or the direction perpendicular to the radius into a plate shape. 2. Quarter-sawn (Quarter or fift sawn, refers to sawing the wood section along the radial surface, or in a direction close to the wood ray, into a plate shape. These two sawing methods are not completely accurate; because the plates of the plain saw gradually approach the radial from the outside to the inside, and the central part becomes the radial saw. Generally speaking, those on the surface of the plate with a growth ring less than 15 degrees are still called plain-sawn boards, otherwise they are called quarter-sawn boards. The method of sawing wood not only affects labor and materials, but also has a relationship with the same nature and beauty. For example, the wood with very wide wood rays can show a beautiful silver luster on the radially sawn surface. Secondly, the relationship between the method of sawing wood sections and the shrinkage of wood is also very large. For wood panels of the same width, the shrinkage after drying during tangential sawing can be about twice as large as during radial sawing. For example, for a certain wood, the width of the one that has been tangentially sawn is 8.6 cm when wet, and shrinks to 7.9 cm after drying, with a shrinkage rate of 8%; the same width of wood panel, if it is radially sawn, is 8.1 cm after drying, with a shrinkage rate of 5% (the reason is detailed in the shrinkage of wood). In addition, the nature of the wood is also affected by whether it is a chord surface or a radial surface; for example, the force and strength of the wood are also very different in the longitudinal and transverse directions (including the radial and chord surfaces). It can be seen from this that the nature of the wood is greatly related to the direction of cell arrangement.

Conclusion: Wood is an organism that takes decades or hundreds of years to mature. In its long growing season, day after day, year after year, it is constantly affected by the outside world, so the wood of various trees is extremely heterogeneous. For example, the relevant uses, weight, texture, color, etc. are all like this. All kinds of wood are cellular structures. Their composition and arrangement have various differences, so there are various structures for various woods. The good art of a kind of wood mostly depends on its nature. However, the properties of wood are mostly due to the differences in the structure and physical chemistry of wood, so it is better to regard various woods as structures rather than as materials.

### Washington is Scolded

— Zeshi

When Washington retired to his hometown at the end of his second term as president, a newspaper published an article scolding him, saying: "Now is the time to rejoice and clap hands—all those who are closely related to the freedom and happiness of the people should be ecstatic at this moment, because from now on, the name Washington will no longer spread political corruption and publicly recognized incompetence."

Before this, Washington had been scolded to death by the opposition party, and couldn't help but complain: "They scolded me so badly that I was bleeding from the head. Even scolding a rogue, a thief, or a petty thief isn't like this."

Everyone knows that Washington was one of the founding fathers of the American Revolution, and devoted himself to national affairs for many years. Who knew that on the day he retired, a dignified newspaper would celebrate the people's freedom and happiness with his "get out." It can be seen that no matter what kind of person, praise and slander at the moment are inevitable. It is difficult to determine what is right and wrong until after the coffin is closed; no, it is difficult to determine even after the coffin is closed.

Moreover, the bigger the person, the more opportunities to be scolded. For example, when I only had one child and he was only three years old, I was very well received by him. Whenever I asked him "Is Dad good?", his answer must be "Good! Dad is good! Good Dad!" Now this child is thirteen years old and has a group of younger siblings. I dare not ask "Is Dad good?" anymore. Sometimes when I ask, he usually just smiles and doesn't answer. This cannot be blamed on him. First, I can no longer satisfy his desires. Even if prices do not rise and my income does not decrease, he can only get at most one-fifth of a bag of fruit candies, which is not as much as he got all of it when he was three years old; second, I am increasingly concerned about his studies and character, and inevitably have to offer advice from time to time, which he cannot accept, because my earnest words may be seen as nonsense to him. And in fact, not only does he slowly disrespect me, but even the younger children do not consistently support me. This is also understandable for them, because on the one hand, I take it as my responsibility to raise and discipline them, and on the other hand, it is difficult for me to fully fulfill their needs. Therefore, I realized that to be a good father, one must not have too many children, so I deeply feel that it is difficult to manage a family, let alone govern a country.

The second reason why great people are necessarily greatly scolded is that it is difficult for any great person to "live up to everyone's expectations." I would even think that my skills are no different from Hitler or Mussolini, because if I were the leader of the Third Reich, or wore a black shirt and became the prime minister of the Roman Empire today, at worst, I would only end up with the country broken and myself dead. Could there be anything worse than them? Therefore, I look down on great people of the past and present, and of course there are millions of people in the world who do so. However, I have a good temper and am humble, so I don't scold great people, and I certainly don't want to replace them. But if someone looks down on great people as much as I do, but is more ambitious than me, then chaos will inevitably arise.

Therefore, it is inevitable that great people will be scolded. The way to deal with it is: Okay, you scold me fiercely enough, then I'll let you be a great person, and you let people scold you. History says that Washington's unwillingness to run for a third term as president was because he didn't want to be scolded again, and his successor, John Adams, was indeed scolded to death even more.

### Birthday

— Jill

Every morning after getting up, my wife asks me as usual what dishes I want to eat, so that she can make a few palatable dishes at noon for a small meal. This can be considered a little consolation for living a poor civil servant's life, because I can be considered a believer who is particular about eating. Today, my wife suddenly asked me what dishes to use, and then I suddenly realized that my birthday had arrived again.

Really, if my wife didn't remind me, I wouldn't remember my birthday. I don't care about my birthday. I think most people feel the same way now. I don't know what the basis is for having to eat on a birthday. Perhaps people in the south usually eat rice, and eating it for a long time can easily lead to beriberi due to a lack of vitamin B, so they use birthdays to change the taste. This may have the same effect as eating taro, dumplings, or wontons in my hometown on the sixth day of the sixth lunar month every year, but perhaps the latter also contains summer hygiene, taking it easy to digest, it is not necessarily.

I also don't know what the basis is for having to celebrate a birthday according to the lunar calendar. Although the solar calendar has long been designated as the national calendar, it is very convenient for children born now to calculate their birthdays according to the national calendar, but how many children celebrate their birthdays according to the national calendar? On the contrary, many children count both the lunar and solar calendars, so this child is blessed and can celebrate two birthdays.

Whenever it is someone's birthday, there are naturally people who hold banquets to celebrate, wishing them a long life, and having a big celebration, but there are also people who just swallow an egg, counting it as a year "rolling" by. But if you are in a bad mood and life is tight, then just simply forget about it, and the birthday is equal to nothing. Accordingly, I am still lucky to have someone remind me.

Some people eat vegetarian food on their birthdays, such as eating vegetarian noodles, saying that the day is "Mother's Day," and eating vegetarian food is "repaying mother's kindness." Although it is a bit of Buddhist thought, it is also reasonable. The relationship between people and their parents is probably mostly just a financial relationship. If they can remember it once a year and eat vegetarian food for their mother for a day, then that would be very meaningful. When everyone can calculate their birthday according to the national calendar, and everyone can regard their birthday as "Mother's Day," perhaps the world can be at peace.

### Talking About Wine in Yue

— Yicun

Mr. Ping writing about drinking wine (Six-Day Liberty Forum) can be said to be "wine meets a kindred spirit," for which, a big cup! Indeed, wine is a very important factor from the beginning, but Shaoxing after the disaster is not as beautiful as imagined or longed for. Eight years in prison not only resulted in the trees being cut down so that they were no longer "Yin" (shady), but "this" road was also damaged to the point of being difficult to travel; the only thing that is somewhat comforting is that the winemaking business is recovering day by day.

Shaoxing is indeed a wine country. Not only does every village have someone making wine, but also six or seven out of ten farmers have home-brewed wine. Those who brew a lot of wine have thousands of jars, and those who brew little can even brew a bowlful. Yellow wine is not necessarily only brewed in Shaoxing. Places like Suzhou and other places also have many Shaoxing people setting up workshops to brew wine, but it is still not as good as Shaoxing's products. The reason is the natural water. Jian Lake meanders for thirty miles, and its clarity and sweetness are exceptionally good. The water for brewing wine is taken from Jian Lake, but it is limited to a few sections to be useful. According to experiments, taking water from two locations at the same time to weigh it, the weight will differ by a lot. This is probably because certain streams contain minerals.

The famous Shaoxing wine-producing areas are the three "Tai" places, namely Ruanshe (the hometown of Ji Kang), Dongpu, and Hutang. There are countless wineries there. Every time during the early spring winemaking season, the air is filled with the aroma of wine, making people feel a little tipsy just by breathing it in.

Speaking of products, outsiders only know "Beijing-packaged" and "Huadiao." In fact, they cannot be considered the best. In Shaoxing, there are "Bamboo Leaf Green" (pure wine without added color), "Gan Chen" (new wine with added color), "Zhuangyuan Hong" (aged wine), "Jia Fan" (a type with heavier raw materials), etc. These are common; better ones are "Shan Niang" (re-brewing wine using wine instead of water), "Fuqiao Wine," and special brews specifically for non-official use as gifts or commemorative items. Some aged wines have been aged for decades and have become like clear water; there is also a type called "Jiu Xue" (Wine Snow), which is brewed with liquor as water and heavy materials, light green, sweet, and mellow. One small cup will make you drunk, making it an even more rare treasure for people in the wine country.

Speaking of drinking wine, it is not necessarily because it is a producing area that people are good at drinking; it is just more common. Many winery owners only drink a tiny bit, while farmers and workers drink four or five times a day, which has become a medicine for them to recover from fatigue. There are many who only drink wine from morning to night, eat little rice, and are perpetually drunk, who are nicknamed "Drunken Idlers"; as for those who can be called "Bull Drinkers," it is the workers in the wineries. When they feel busy, thirsty, hungry, or tired, they dip their heads into any vat and swallow a mouthful. They don't need any appetizers; they wipe their faces with their sleeves and go back to work. This is called "Looking in the Big Mirror."

Finally, let's talk about buying wine. On the roads of Shanyin, you don't have to worry about finding wine everywhere, and the prices are cheap, but you can't buy good wine because the selling point here depends entirely on added water (people who are used to drinking it don't find it strange). If you want to buy good wine, you have to put in some effort. "Which one is good?" "Which one is newly opened?" People in Shaoxing ask each other like this. Those wealthy people who come to Shanyin Road to "crowd around" even need to "ask about local customs upon entering the area!"

### Hair Identification Method

— Hezhe

Although people's faces are different, it is often difficult to identify them, so someone invented the fingerprints to identify them. The judicial circles are now quite using this method. All the thieves and criminals are called to print a hand mold. According to the type of texture, compiled into the number, recorded in the book, where has committed a crime only need to put his hand mold number on the book to check, let him how to deny, how to disguise, also can not escape.

Hair has the same effect as fingerprints. Experts in criminal science have long adopted this identification method to supplement the lack of fingerprints and increase the effectiveness of identification. According to scientific research, people's hair, under a very strong microscope, has very fine scales, similar to fish scales. The center of the hair is hollow, containing colored substances.

According to scientists, no two people have exactly the same hair structure. The points of hair identification are the thickness of the hair, the size of the central tube, the size of the scales, and the nature of the hair surface. Therefore, the judicial circles have one more tool for dealing with criminals.

### Portrait

— Tian

Female customer: "Who told you to paint me so ugly? Look, this portrait is simply painting a hippopotamus! I can't pay."

Painter: "Madam, why didn't you think about it before you told me to paint it?"

Welcoming the Xinjiang Song and Dance Troupe Zhang Yiqu

Yesterday, the weather was partly cloudy, and I was invited by Mr. Zhan Yuesheng and others to a banquet on the Jiangya Wheel to welcome the Xinjiang Song and Dance Troupe. It was a grand occasion, so I wrote a poem to record it.

Half a day sailing on the Huangpu River,
A grand banquet is extraordinary:
The wind is clear and the clouds are light, the songs are far,
The sea is vast and the sky is wide, the laughter is cool;
Meeting like old friends for the first time,
Wishing Xinjiang safe and sound;
In the future, when we go west of Yangguan,
We will raise our cups together.

### On Minor Disappointments

— Heku

Disappointed people often have an idiom in their minds, called "Things in life are seldom completely satisfactory," which is a bit too pessimistic about life. If more than 80% of things are unsatisfactory, can it still be considered that humans can conquer nature? For example, if there are two roads ahead: one is the road to happiness, and the other is the road to sorrow. When you choose, of course, you won't take the road to sorrow. Also, if there are two bowls of soup in front of you, one is bitter medicine and the other is sweet milk, of course, you like to drink milk. When we start walking or drinking soup, we have already decided to choose the happy and satisfying things to start with. Then the idiom "Things in life are seldom completely satisfactory" is not valid because people will never choose to do unsatisfactory things first, unless that person is an idiot.

However, in your life, you will inevitably encounter some minor disappointments, inevitably chasing after you, making you feel annoyed and worried. Perhaps the fountain pen in your pocket was inadvertently stolen by a thief when you were getting on a public bus; perhaps after happily holding chrysanthemums, you feel that your stomach has been upset and you have diarrhea all night; perhaps when you entrusted someone to send a beloved gift to a distant person, the entrusted person lost it on the way... All of these belong to the category of minor disappointments in life, which are unavoidable. Although they do not cause you to feel intense frustration, the situation is similar to being stung by a wasp, a bit painful and a bit swollen, but it will not harm your overall health.

It is said that this is the twist and turns of life. The ideal state of smooth sailing is often difficult to reach. There must be some twist and turns, and the twist and turns are experience, making your life more complete and satisfactory. You must lose the first fountain pen and buy the second one to understand the true meaning of "cherishing things"; you must have an upset stomach after eating crabs for the first time to know how to chew carefully and eat in moderation. It is regrettable that the accumulation of life experience is indeed a lot, but there are more novel experiences because the complexity of dusty affairs makes it impossible to find a constant "constant" of experience that can be applied to various encounters. Therefore, minor disappointments are seen repeatedly, not just once.

Today, my wife was very happy to have sold two pounds of wool, ready to make a wool shirt for me, but she forgot to bring it back on the rickshaw, so she felt annoyed. I can only use the above meaning to comfort her.

Among the New Year's greetings, there is a sentence "May all your wishes come true". Can all things truly be as one wishes? Therefore, the end of the greeting is just a greeting, alas.

### Carefree Flower

— Chen Shenyan

Chapter 3: Onstage and Offstage (15)

It was not until he got off work at five o'clock that Zhuzhai made a decision. Since he had agreed, he should go. He hired a car to the North China Restaurant. On the way, he thought of many things to say, preparing to deal with the meeting. He didn't expect that when he arrived at the North China Restaurant, Qiyun was already waiting in the private room. When she met him, she only smiled and said, "You are really busy. I've been here for a while. Why didn't you come to my house this morning?" Zhuzhai was about to stammer when Qiyun asked again, "Was the lady sitting on the east side last night your wife?" Zhuzhai's heart was pounding like a drum, afraid that she would question him. He said awkwardly, "Yes, she usually doesn't go out much. She is an old-fashioned wife and doesn't know anything about the outside world. Last night, because you asked her to go, I pulled her out." Qiyun said, "I thought your wife must be very beautiful and very refined. I wanted to take this opportunity to meet her." Zhuzhai said, "What's so beautiful about her? She doesn't even have any common sense and is too ignorant." Zhuzhai said these words to explain Fengsheng's slip of the tongue last night. Unexpectedly, Qiyun frowned when she heard this and shook her head slightly, saying, "Things in the world are never perfect. This is also a regret for you. How did you get to know her in the first place?" Zhuzhai said, "She is the third daughter of my aunt. The one who proposed marriage to me back then was her eldest sister, not her. Her eldest sister was well-educated, very lively, and also beautiful. Later, she went to Shanghai to study and suddenly changed her mind and ran away with someone else. Her father thought that everyone knew about our marriage, and it wouldn't sound good if it got out, so he wanted to marry his third daughter, who is now my wife, to me. I didn't want to, but my father insisted on it. I opposed this matter several times and even hid in Jinan once. My uncle persuaded me to come back, saying that if I opposed it again, I would make my father angry to death. I was forced by family pressure and finally surrendered." Qiyun nodded and said with great emotion, "These old ethical concepts in China, if they are not broken, will really mislead people! Your marital experience is the same as my father's. My father was originally engaged to my maternal aunt. Later, my maternal aunt ran away. To save face, my maternal grandmother had my mother play the role of my maternal aunt and marry him. Later, my father found out and had no good feelings for my mother. He would make an issue out of everything. Even after my mother had children, my father was still constantly angry with my mother because of this problem. The couple could never be harmonious, which made my mother unwilling to be with my father. She hid in Shanghai all year round, believed in Buddhism, and chanted scriptures. Even when she was old, her feelings could not be reconciled. In this way, we children are too difficult in the family!" Zhuzhai listened and felt a sense of mutual sympathy. He felt sad in his heart, holding the remaining brandy in his glass, and didn't know what to say for a while. Then Qiyun said again, "Today, I heard you say these words, and I feel the same. I hope you don't have a temper like my father. My mother's experience is very pitiful!" Zhuzhai listened and remained silent.

### Talking About Shijiazhuang

—

Since the news of the police in Shijiazhuang reached Pingjin, for half a month, the obvious changes in North China have been the soaring prices, the rampant black market for gold banknotes, and many rumors. Generally, people open their mouths "Shimen!" and close their mouths "Shimen!" It's really a bit of panic. What is the status and relationship of Shimen in the overall situation in North China? They have no systematic research, but just unconscious hesitation.

Although Shijiazhuang belongs to Huolu County and is close to Zhengding (less than twenty miles due south of Zhengding, and forty or fifty miles west of Huolu), it used to be quite lively, but it is a large village town in terms of local characteristics. Although it is located on the road from Beijing to Wuhan, it is standing in Zhengding, followed by Luancheng. The distance between "Zheng" and "Le" is only one stop, only sixty miles apart, and Shizhuang is located in between, but a "tea tip" is a small place to stay, and no one pays attention to it. When the Qing Dynasty built the Beijing-Hankou (Pinghan) Railway, it was built along the old post road. Shizhuang is a small station south of Zhengding. However, for the west road, this village is just due east of Niangziguan. Since the formation of the Zhengtai Railway, the face has become important. That is, the section from Zhengding to Shizhuang is still the Pinghan Line, from Shizhuang to the west to Huolu, not Xing, but Niangziguan, to reach Taiyuan, so the so-called "Zhengtai" is actually "Shitai". "Shitai" and "Pinghan" form a "T" shape, and Shizhuang is at the intersection, which is the central station for coal transportation between Jin and Hebei.

The impression of the relationship between Shizhuang and the overall situation occurred in the winter of Xinhai. When the Wuhan Revolutionary Army rose, Wu Luzhen stationed troops here to prevent the Qing army from going south, and echoed with Zhang Shaozeng in Qizhou. He was really so-called "绾　中樞", which was crucial. Yuan Shikai sent someone to assassinate Wu, and then the soldiers of the Third Town were able to drive straight into Niangziguan. At that time, the military importance of Shijiazhuang was unparalleled. The place name is gradually known to the world.

The two major trunk lines south of Beiping, one Tianjin-Pukou and one Pinghan, are winding for thousands of miles, shaped like parallel lines. A transverse connecting line is needed in the middle. Therefore, the Ministry of Posts and Communications of the former Qing Dynasty had a plan to build the "Cangshi Road". (Cangzhou of Jinpu Line travels west to Shizhuang), and then because the Shanghai Sea Road of northern Jiangsu has been Xuzhou Zhengzhou, it has been extended. Until the "September 18th" Incident, the Japanese invaders invaded North China and took holding the railway as the "national policy" to control the five provinces in the north. The Chahar Political Affairs Committee was established, advocating economic cooperation. The first major requirement was to build the Cangyou Railway. Although Song Zheyuan perfunctory in every way, he insisted that it was impossible on this matter and avoided living in Leling. The "July 7th" Incident broke out as a result.

After the fall of North China, the puppet "Provisional Government" was established, and the enemy established the so-called "North China Transportation Co., Ltd.", a monster like its South Manchurian Railway, and immediately began to build the "Deshi Railway". The reason why "Cangshi" was changed to "Deshi" was because Dezhou was on the northeast side of the east and bordering Hebei Province. It is more important to be on the Jinpu Line 380 miles south of Cangzhou, and more than 200 miles south is Jinan, which connects to the Jiaoji Railway to link to the Qingdao port, which is very convenient.

The purpose of the Japanese people in doing this is still mainly economic. The western neighbor of Shizhuang is the famous Jingxing Coal Mine in Hebei. Further west is the Baiyan Coal and Zhazi Coal from the west, and the Zibo Coal Mine and Iron Mine east of Jinan are all connected. The resources of North China are completely in control. The ambition for decades has come true. Unexpectedly, evil is full, and after eight years, it surrendered completely and lost all. After China took over, the people with the "共" brand continued to rise, and their goal was to destroy. In the past two years, it has been dismantled section by section and destroyed segment by segment. The Deshi Road, which the Japanese people had worked hard to build, has no complete country, and even the Pinghan Road, an old trunk line of many years, is in a mess. First, Shijiazhuang and Baoding were not camel-like, and then the planes between Beiping and Baoding were also flying back and forth. The so-called Shimen, which connects the four directions, has long become a "light pole peony" that is exposed and has no support and whose limbs are all broken. Those who guarded it before could not keep it, so how can those who have it now be used as a base for attacking other places!

What's ridiculous is that the "nervous" theorists in the Pingjin area tell each other in a moving way. It's not that the other side has obtained this, can enter Shanxi to the west, can attack Baoding to the north, and can do something to the east and south. That is to say, Baoding has lost its barrier and is in danger. These dull brains and stereotyped arguments can be said to be completely unconscious. This kind of speculation, if it were in the era of Wu Luzhen, would still be possible, because the railway at that time was complete and the war was linear. Wu's occupation of Shizhuang would make it possible to attack Baoding to the north and take Shanxi to the west. But now the other side has always used guerrilla tactics, a scattered and multifaceted formation, and does not need to occupy Shizhuang before attacking Baoding. Moreover, before Shizhuang was lost, Baoding had already been in a battle of offense and defense all around. The car between Ping and Bao has long been out of service. What does it have to do with the gains and losses of Shizhuang's isolated city? Moreover, the north-south and east-west railway and highway in Zhuangzao has been destroyed by them, so at this time, how can there be ready-made transportation tools for them to transport! Therefore, the gains and losses of Shizhuang, in the past two years (that is, after the four-sided traffic has been cut off), are in no way a decisive victory or defeat.

However, the loss of Shizhuang has stimulated the nerves of ordinary people, which has its own reasons. Because Shizhuang has been painstakingly managed by Japan for several years, it has become a modern metropolis. Factories, newspaper offices, shopping malls, airports, theaters, government offices, schools, and banks are all newly built. With the money they squeezed, the streets are wide and tidy, the buildings are magnificent, and merchants from all directions gather, creating a false prosperity. Famous actors from Pingjin also often go to perform, and the major merchants send branches one after another. In the past, the cities in Hebei Province were "Pingjinbao" as the "three major ones", but now with Beiping as the center, Tianjin still ranks first in the east road, followed by Tangshan, and Shizhuang ranks first in the west road, while Baoding is below it. The only large city on the Pinghan Line, once lost, is said to have been baptized by artillery fire and become a ruin. This kind of news stimulates the nerves of the northern masses, which is naturally different from the offense and defense of other cities and towns.

However, in fact, in the other party's strategy, it is only a kind of nervous offensive. If you look at it as Shizhuang in the era of Wu Luzhen and make the routine of historians that you can take a certain place to the north, capture a certain place to the west, how to do something to the east, and how to do something to the south, then it is completely in line with the dull scholars' discussion of the real situation.

Let's take Fu Zuoyi's recovery of Zhangjiakou last year as a counter-evidence. The reason why the right is of great importance in military strategy is that Suichang is advancing eastward from Gui. It has always been "steady and steady", with a linear advancing posture, and it is based on the main strategy of building one step at a time. The value of obtaining Zhangtan lies not in the recovery of this one place, but in stabilizing the Ping Sui Railway, flexing the muscles of the overall northwest, and forming a high-level advantage. In other words, if the army is also scattered guerrillas and scorched earth warfare, then the occupation of this one place is just an isolated city ruin. Can it be like the current dignified new Great Wall wall?

I have received your letter. Our newspaper has limited space and your manuscript cannot be published. I am very sorry! According to the Criminal Procedure Law, if a party is dissatisfied with the judgment of the lower court, they may appeal to the higher court within the time limit. Your son's case can be appealed according to the law to find out the truth.
