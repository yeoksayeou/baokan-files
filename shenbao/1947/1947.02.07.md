[Our Newspaper, Xuzhou, 6th] The National Army advancing north from Tancheng in Southern Shandong is now less than 15 kilometers from Linyi. Linyi is expected to fall imminently.

[Our Newspaper, Xuzhou, 6th] The National Army in Southern Shandong reached the outskirts of Yixian County on the 5th. The Communist troops inside the city were in a state of panic, preparing to retreat. The National Army at Yutai recovered Guting Town on the morning of the 4th.

[Our Newspaper, Jinan, 6th] After the National Army's Huo Shouyi unit recovered Laiwu City on the 4th, the Communist troops who had fled south of the city and to its flanks launched a counterattack from three directions towards the outskirts of the city starting on the 5th. Fighting continued until late at night.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 6th] Fierce battles have been raging for days along the Longhai Railway in areas such as Xiaoba and Liuhe. On the 6th, the Communist troops completely collapsed and are retreating northwest towards Shangqiu, reorganizing around Loulou, seemingly preparing to attack Shangqiu. South of the Yuxinan Railway, there has been considerable movement of Communist troops, but no significant signs of advance as of yet. Yanzhuang, east of Laiwu in Southern Shandong, was recovered on the 6th, and the Communist troops retreated towards Mengyin in Jiawu.

[Our Newspaper, Xuzhou, 6th] The Communist 79th and 2nd Divisions, totaling over 30,000 men, sneaked to Guanqiao and Duweizi, north of Lincheng, on the 4th, threatening to attack Lincheng.

[Our Newspaper, Bengbu, 6th] According to air force reconnaissance, a small number of Communist troops are in Taixian County, planning to transport supplies north, with most troops stationed in the surrounding countryside.

[Our Newspaper, Xuzhou, 5th] The Communist Yang Yong unit, with 4,000 to 5,000 men, captured Zhou, 30 li northeast of Dangshan, on the night of the 4th. Furthermore, the Communist Liu Bocheng unit of over 10,000 men, which captured Hao County on the morning of the 3rd, continued to flee east on the 5th, attempting to attack Xiayi.

[Our Newspaper, Hankou, 6th] The Chief of Staff of the General Headquarters, Wang Ziming, recently told reporters regarding the situation in the Central Plains: Zhengzhou's defense is solid, and the rumors of the fall of Kaifeng are unfounded. Judging from the current situation, it will be extremely difficult for the Communist troops to succeed in attacking Xuzhou.

[Our Newspaper, Jinan, 6th] Because National Army reinforcements have arrived in the outskirts of Jinan, Qihé and Yancheng are secure. From 11 PM on the 5th to dawn on the 6th, the Communist troops attacked the northwestern suburbs of Qihé. After a night of fierce fighting, the Communist troops were finally repelled. The main force of the Communist troops, the 7th and 11th Divisions under Xie, are gathering near the outer Jinan regiment, claiming they will attack Jinan at the end of the first lunar month, but most of them have recently disappeared. It is said that they have gone to Southern Shandong to participate in the war, and the talk of attacking Jinan is just a show of force.

### Pacification Work Completed in Southern Shandong, National Army Set to Converge in Three Routes

[United Press, Nanjing, 6th] The National Army is now advancing directly into Linyi in three routes. The decisive battle in Southern Shandong is imminent. The southern assault force, composed of elite National Army troops, is said to have crossed Lijiazhuang, and its vanguard has reached Xibailinzhuang, six miles south of Linyi. The eastern assault force, led by Hao, has already crossed the Yi River and joined the southern force. The northern force, Wang Yaowu's troops advancing south along the Jiaoji Railway, is making rapid progress and has recently captured Laiwu. Aware of the National Army's urgency, the Communist troops in Linyi are accelerating their withdrawal from the urban area. The vanguard, three miles outside Linyi, is now visible, along with large fires and explosions in the city.

According to frontline reports, the Communist troops in Southern Shandong are still engaging in positional warfare, while retreating into the mountains to implement guerrilla warfare in order to impede the National Army's advance.

[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 6th] The National Army has completed the initial pacification work in Southern Shandong, and the annihilation of Liu Bocheng's three columns on the border of Jiangsu, Shandong, Henan, and Anhui has shattered the Communist troops' attempt to encircle Xuzhou. What will follow is not the Xuzhou battle imagined by Chen Yi and Liu Bocheng, but the Southern Shandong battle. Because Liu Bocheng's 2nd, 6th, and 7th columns were severely attacked by the National Army near Shangqiu and Hao County and are fleeing for reorganization, they are no longer able to support Chen Yi. At the same time, Chen Yi is in a disadvantageous defensive position. How he will struggle is now a matter of close attention from all parties here. Based on reasonable judgment, Chen Yi will choose one of the following paths: (1) lead his troops to surrender to the government; (2) engage in a desperate battle with the National Army in Linyi; (3) flee to the mountains; (4) retreat to Jiaodong; (5) cross the Jinpu Railway and join Liu Bocheng; (6) flee back to Northern Jiangsu. Among these, the third possibility is more likely, and the first possibility has a partial chance of realization. Chen Yi is a well-established figure among the Communist troops (referring to commanders and soldiers). It is widely believed that the National Army's second phase of offensive in Southern Shandong will surely defeat him. The Communist Party's belief in "violence is omnipotent" will also be shaken.

(2) Question: When you write your memoirs in the future, do you think the past year was a waste or did it have its price? Answer: It educated me, and it also educated the people.

### Tani Hisao on Trial in Nanjing; Evading Responsibility for the Nanjing Massacre; Audience Outraged by Screening of Atrocity Films

[Special Dispatch from Nanjing, February 6] Tani Hisao, the main perpetrator of the Nanjing Massacre, has been on public trial at the Lixingshe since 2:00 PM on the 6th. The trial is scheduled to last for three days. In addition to questioning Tani on this day, American witnesses Professor Jin Da, Smith and Pace, Xu Chuanyin, Vice President of the Red Swastika Society, Japanese witness Ogasawara Ao, and victims or their family members were summoned to testify. The trial lasted for four hours. At 6:00 PM, massacre films were shown until 6:20 PM. The court was set up in the auditorium of the Lixingshe, and 1,300 audience passes were issued. Although the audience was very crowded, the order was very good. Mr. and Mrs. Wang Chonghui and Wang Shijie were present as spectators. At 2:00 PM, Court President Shi Meiyu and his party arrived in court. Soon, Tani was escorted to court, wearing a yellow woolen military uniform, yellow leather shoes, a light gray woolen hat, and a black woolen overcoat, carrying a leather bag. He was short and fat, with a sallow complexion and a fleshy face. More than 100 family members of the victims appeared in court. First, the Court President asked Tani about his age and place of origin. Then, Prosecutor Chen Guang read out the indictment, which was then translated into Japanese by the interpreter. Tani listened intently. Then, the prosecutor added the following explanations: (1) In terms of time, the massacre period lasted for several months, and the indictment only listed the 8th and 9th. (2) In terms of area, the massacre range was as wide as inside and outside the city, and the indictment only mentioned a corner of Zhonghua Gate. (3) In terms of numbers, the victims of the massacre numbered more than 400,000, and the indictment only mentioned more than 40,000. His crimes also included: 1. Destruction of property, 2. Robbery, 3. Rape. One woman was raped 37 times and then killed. Some women were killed with more than 30 knives on their faces for refusing to be raped. Some pregnant women were killed, and the fetus was still in their wombs. Secondly, near Hanzhongmen, more than 2,000 people were killed at one time, and 50,000 people were killed in Caoxie Gorge, etc. It is estimated that the victims of collective massacres amounted to 394,508 people, sporadic killings numbered 987 people, and assassinations numbered 719 people, totaling more than 400,000. After the prosecutor's explanation, the Court President said: "The defendant participated in the invasion war and participated in the massacre, which constitutes a war crime in violation of Articles 23, 46, and 47 of the Hague Convention, a crime against humanity, and a crime against peace. The number of massacre crimes committed, as investigated by the Municipal Council, is 2,784 cases." Then, he asked about his experience and participation in the invasion of China. Regarding the Nanjing Massacre, he asked whether the responsibility should be placed on the military headquarters or the Japanese Emperor. Tani sophistically argued: "I am a soldier and only know how to obey orders. I claim to be unaware of national policies." He also falsely claimed that he personally advocated East Asian peace and Sino-Japanese friendship. Regarding the massacre, Tani said: "I can assert that my subordinates would never do such a thing." Then, the Court President instructed to display the skeletons excavated from Yuhuatai in front of the trial stage, and the forensic doctor explained the examination process and provided a list of explanations. Tani argued: "According to the listed burial time, it was December 22 of that year, and my troops had already been transferred." Then, Xu Chuanyin, Vice President of the Red Swastika Society, testified about the situation at the time and said: "The listed 22nd is not the date of the killing, but the date of burial and filling out the form." Then, he explained the situation of corpses all over the city at that time and the situation of his relatives and friends being killed in Xiaohuowa Lane. Tani immediately argued: "It is not within my defense zone and I cannot be held responsible." Then, American witnesses Smith and Pace explained the various atrocities they witnessed in Nanjing that year. Yao Jialong, a family member of the victim, stated that the enemy soldiers killed his wife and three children at the time, and he himself was also shot. Then, the victim Chen Ergu was summoned to the court. The court asked, "Were you raped by the Japanese that year?" Chen angrily replied loudly, "Yes." Asked, "How many people?" Chen replied, "Two people." Asked, "Did both people rape you?" Answered "Yes". And said: "The Japanese used guns to threaten, there was no way to resist." At this point, Tani sophistically claimed: "Where is the location?" The Court President said: "Within your defense zone." Tani had no words. Finally, Japanese man Ogasawara Ao testified for him, using cunning and empty excuses. At 6:00 PM, the trial ended, and the Court President announced that the trial would continue on the 7th. After a short break, a film about the massacre was shown so that Tani could watch it in court. The audience witnessed the horrific scenes and were filled with outrage. When Tani was escorted back, they shouted "Shoot him!" "Shoot him!"

### Editorial: Starting with the Complaints of American Businesses

Since the 2nd of this month, American news agencies have repeatedly reported that American businesses in China are complaining to the State Department about being squeezed out and discriminated against in their business dealings in China. Subsequently, a spokesperson for the U.S. State Department officially stated that the U.S. authorities are considering the complaints raised by American businesses in China, and the U.S. Embassy in China is also closely monitoring the situation. The Shanghai-based "North China Daily News" published an editorial yesterday, also stating that foreign businesses in China are suffering from exclusion and discrimination, and not just American businesses. Merchants from other countries in China also feel deeply uneasy about the current trend of China's trade policy. We believe that this issue is not only related to China's foreign trade, but also has a significant impact on China's financial economy, and we must clarify it to dispel the concerns of merchants from various countries in China, so as to correct international perception.

We cannot oppose the United States' efforts to restore post-war international trade freedom in principle. However, our country is an economically backward country, and all industries cannot be called industrialized. In order to develop our country's industry, we must adopt the so-called "moderate protection" measures. Because economically backward countries cannot stand on an equal footing with economically developed countries. If we insist on freedom, equality, reciprocity, and mutual benefit, it will only benefit economically developed countries. This is the cornerstone of our country's foreign trade policy. I remember that when the United Nations Economic and Social Council held a preparatory meeting on international trade and employment in London on October 15 last year, the Chinese representative, Dr. Jin Wensi, also said this, and hoped that the representatives of all countries attending the meeting could put forward active and specific suggestions so that economically less developed countries can complete their industrialization tasks as soon as possible.

The Chinese government announced the revised import and export trade measures on November 17 last year, which is based on this meaning. The specific measures are five: (1) General control, adopting a licensing system for all imported goods; (2) Prohibiting unnecessary imports; (3) Adopting a quota system for goods allowed to be imported; (4) Allowing priority import for very needed imported goods; (5) Treating importers equally, regardless of whether they are government or private, without discrimination. Therefore, when this method began to be implemented, it was not only unanimously supported by the people of the whole country, but also the kind merchants of various countries in China also expressed sympathy and understanding for the difficulties of the Chinese authorities having to adopt this "moderate protection" method, and were willing to sincerely abide by this method. However, less than three months after this method was implemented, American businessmen in China filed complaints with their government, and the Shanghai-based "North China Daily News" also called this "a bad policy," which makes us feel regret.

According to a dispatch from United Press International in New York on the 2nd, the reasons for the complaints of American businessmen in China to the State Department can be analyzed as follows: (1) American business representatives in China have not been able to obtain import licenses for goods beyond the allotted amount, while general semi-official companies can still obtain import licenses by using their political connections; (2) These semi-official companies use political relations and other pressures to force manufacturers to hand over their agency accounts to them; and pre-empt all production plans set by American companies months or even years ago; (3) Since the revised import and export trade measures were promulgated on November 17 last year, American businessmen have not been able to obtain import licenses for goods worth more than US$5,000, so that the heavy industrial equipment urgently needed for China's reconstruction, even though orders have been placed for eighteen months, cannot be obtained.

Regarding the complaints of American businessmen in China, even before it has been verified, we should adopt the attitude of "correcting mistakes if we have made them and being vigilant if we have not," and first conduct a self-examination to see if there are any facts as stated in the American businessmen's complaints. Because the facts presented by the United States, even if weighed against the revised import and export trade measures promulgated by our government, are a distressing illegal act, and the government should bear the responsibility for thorough investigation and correction! Isn't it clearly stipulated in the measures that government and private merchants should be treated equally? However, we must also point out to the United States and other countries' merchants in China that even if the reasons for the American businessmen's complaints to their government are verified, it is only the mismanagement of the competent authorities, not the irrationality of the revised import and export trade measures. This point must be clarified.

Therefore, standing from the people's position, our attitude towards this issue is very simple: on the one hand, we hope that the Chinese government will strive for fairness in implementing the revised import and export trade measures, especially for industrial and commercial organizations operated or managed by the government. No preferential treatment should be given, and all procedures should be the same as those for private industrial and commercial organizations, so as to ensure equal opportunities and free competition, so as to avoid causing dissatisfaction among the latter. As the saying goes, "If there is injustice, there will be a cry." The American businessmen's complaints to their government are by no means unfounded. At the same time, we also hope that foreign businessmen in China should broaden their horizons, first recognize the goods that China urgently needs at present, and then import the goods that China urgently needs, and never only know how to covet immediate interests and ignore the needs of China's national economy and people's livelihood. We want foreign businessmen to understand that the future of trade with China is entirely based on China's domestic prosperity. If they only know how to come to China to make profits but do not know how to cultivate the purchasing power of the Chinese people, then there is little bright future for trade with China. Frankly speaking, the crisis of foreign trade in China does not lie in being excluded and discriminated against, but in the dumping of foreign goods that make the Chinese people poor and financially exhausted, which is most worthy of concern. It is hoped that all countries' merchants in China can consider this.

Correction: In the seventh line of the third paragraph of the editorial on the 5th of this month, "one hundred and fourteen times" is a mistake for two point one four times, especially corrected.

### The Disaster Situation in Hunan and Guangxi is Tragic: Guilin is Almost a Dead City

[This Newspaper News] A reporter from the Central News Agency traveled south by plane on the 30th of last month and visited Guangzhou, Liuzhou, and Guilin. Post-war South China is no longer what it used to be. In the year and a half since then, due to the impact of economic difficulties, the market is no longer as prosperous as before the war, especially in Liuzhou and Guilin. To this day, only two or three out of ten have been restored. Liuzhou has better conditions due to waterway transportation, and there is a little commercial exchange. Guilin has become almost a dead city due to the loss of transportation connections. Disaster victims in Guangxi are scattered in the countryside. Recently, thanks to the relief efforts of the Administrative Relief Committee, they have勉渡難關勉渡難關勉渡難關勉渡難關勉渡難關勉渡難關勉渡難關勉渡難關勉渡難關 barely survived the difficulties, but there is a feeling that there are too many monks and not enough porridge. It is believed that a major tragic event may be staged again in February and March this year, when the crops are not yet ready for harvest. The disaster situation in Hunan and Guangxi provinces is the most serious, and we cannot ignore it. In Guangzhou, since Mayor Ouyang Ju took office, monthly income and expenditure have been able to offset each other. Recently, he borrowed 10 billion yuan from the four banks to build roads, and construction has begun actively.

[Our Newspaper Kaifeng Dispatch] The Zhongmu Bridge on the Longhai Railway was suddenly destroyed on the evening of January 27 due to the exceptionally cold weather and the freezing of the Yellow River. The ice blocks were as big as mountain peaks. Stations such as Xiaoba and Liuhe on the eastern section were also destroyed by the Communist army, resulting in the suspension of east-west trains. The railway authorities noted that the Bianxin branch line had been dismantled due to the diversion of water from the Yellow River breach. Now, there is not much water in the old course, and the Zhongmu River is turbulent, making the bridge difficult to repair. Therefore, it was decided to build a temporary bridge on the old course of the Yellow River at Damazhuang on the Bianxin branch line and re-lay the rails on the branch line to avoid interrupting the traffic on the western section. Materials are being prepared and construction will begin soon.

### More Than 1,000 American Sheep Will Be Bred in Haining

[Our Newspaper Haining Dispatch] More than 1,000 American sheep allocated to our country by the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration will arrive in Shanghai soon. In order to find a suitable area for breeding, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry designated that it must be within the counties of Jiaxing Prefecture to facilitate production and transportation. Therefore, it sent personnel to Xiaqian a few days ago. The Agricultural Extension Institute immediately sent personnel to accompany them to inspect the vast public lands in this county. A reporter visited after hearing the news and was told that the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry intends to find a field with an area of more than 2,000 mu for long-term sheep breeding, and the expenses and sheep sheds will be directly allocated by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry. This time, it is believed that the people of this county originally used sheep breeding as a sideline, but the poor breed quality resulted in low wool production. In the inspection area in this county, one is the coastal area of Yanguan, Donghu Wengbu, and the other is Dongshan in Xiashi. The former has inconvenient transportation and the area is not suitable. The latter has more green grass, and the environment and transportation are particularly suitable, and the area is vast. It will be reported that the area will be used to prepare for development, and another survey will be conducted in Xiaqian.

Just as he was drinking, gunshots were suddenly heard. The captain saw that the situation was not good and immediately returned to the squadron headquarters, where he saw more than a dozen bandits, each holding long and short weapons, surrounding the area and shouting to stop him from advancing. Unexpectedly, the newly recruited soldier in the team (from Anhui) also joined the bandits, using a machine gun to blindly fire. Captain Gao immediately fought back. For a time, gunshots rang out, and the residents of the entire town were panicked. However, because they were outnumbered, one soldier was killed and two were injured by the bandits. A light machine gun, 16 rifles, and a Mauser pistol were seized, and a Shu Wanhua jewelry store was robbed before they fled in a hurry. At this time, the order was in chaos, and reinforcements could not arrive in time. Captain Gao immediately telegraphed the Jinshan County Government to send a team to assist in the suppression. At the same time, he led the local团警团警团警团警团警团警 village police to track and pursue. The bandits had already fled far away.

### Atomic Control and Disarmament Issues US and USSR Gradually Move Towards Compromise Both Sides Agree to Use the French Proposal as a Basis for Discussion

[Our Newspaper News] San Francisco, 6th Broadcast: The UN Security Council Six-Nation Committee has agreed that the Security Council will immediately and simultaneously study both the general disarmament and atomic energy control proposals. The Six-Nation Committee held a closed-door meeting today to draft disarmament procedures, accepting the first two points of the French compromise proposal.

[Our Newspaper News] San Francisco, 6th Broadcast: There has been a compromise between the US and the USSR, which has begun to break the current deadlock in the Security Council on disarmament procedures. Representatives from the US and the USSR have reached a consensus on all points, causing disagreement among the Six-Nation Committee on the method of handling disarmament. The US representative, Austin, believes that it should be immediately stated that the work of the Disarmament Committee does not conflict with the work of the UN Atomic Control Committee. The Soviet representative opposed, believing that this statement was unnecessary.

[United Press New York, 5th] The UN Security Council Six-Nation Committee held a closed-door meeting today to discuss the disarmament issue. It is reported that representatives from the US and the USSR have abandoned the points of intense debate and accepted the French compromise proposal. France proposed the establishment of a Disarmament Committee to submit various proposals to the Security Council, and suggested that the Security Council should quickly discuss the report of the Atomic Energy Committee to instruct the Atomic Energy Committee to start new work. During the meeting, the US representative, Austin, apparently abandoned the request to establish a subcommittee to draft the rules of procedure for the Disarmament Committee. Austin frequently left the meeting to make phone calls, once making an urgent call to Washington. The Soviet representative, Gromyko, generally accepted the French proposal, only opposing the point that the Security Council should order the Military Staff Committee to submit a report within three months, which France immediately cancelled. The only point that remains to be resolved is the US request for a special provision that the work of the Disarmament Committee should not hinder the work of the Atomic Energy Committee.

### Marshall Submits 27 Proposals to Congress Emphasizes Relief Plan After UNRRA Ends

[United Press Washington, 6th] Secretary of State Marshall has sent a letter to Senate Speaker Vandenberg, listing the continued relief plan after the end of UNRRA as the top priority among the several important matters submitted by the State Department to Congress. President Truman had previously informed Congress that he would request Congress to allocate hundreds of millions of dollars for the continued relief of other countries, especially Italy, Austria, and Greece. Marshall listed the ratification of the peace treaties with the five countries as the second priority, and the US joining the International Refugee Organization as the third priority. The letter lists a total of 27 items, of which 10 are considered important. Important items also include allowing refugees to enter the United States, developing cultural relations outside the Western Hemisphere, donating the UN headquarters site, and exempting it from taxes. Vandenberg told reporters: The United States will take over some of the relief work from UNRRA to avoid famine. Vandenberg also said: He believes that no one is willing to shirk this responsibility.

US Relief Plan is Very Unfavorable to China

[United Press Washington, 5th] A representative from the UNRRA headquarters told this agency this month that some Chinese officials believe that under the European food relief plan led by the United States, China has become the main victim. The plan will be announced by UNRRA Director-General Rooks this week and proposes to allocate 35 million US dollars for the relief of European food after the end of UNRRA. The total amount of funds consists of 4 million US dollars in UNRRA deposits, 6 million dollars taken from the Czech Republic's allocation, and 25 million US dollars in "unused funds" from other countries. The 15 million US dollars under China's name are also within the "unused funds." Therefore, the relief funds for China before the end of June will inevitably be reduced by 15 million US dollars. It is said that this will inevitably cause fierce disputes in the UNRRA Central Committee, so this plan is unlikely to be approved.

Pepper Criticizes Republican Policies Again

The British representative, Strang, said that those who decided to declare war on Germany in 1939 without being attacked should be considered directly related to the German issue.

If there is no Speaker, or if the Speaker is not qualified, the President of the Senate should temporarily act as President until a qualified Speaker of the House is elected.

### Soviet General Headquarters Issues Fifth Demobilization Order Since the War

[United Press Moscow, 5th] The Soviet General Headquarters today issued the fifth demobilization order since the war, which is another step in the Soviet Union's return to peacetime life and providing manpower for agriculture and industry. The new demobilization order will take effect from March to June this year, and the number of demobilized personnel seems to be more than the previous one. The Soviet Union, like other countries, had demobilized older soldiers and conscripted younger ones. But there are now clear signs that a large number of Soviet young people of military age have not been conscripted into the army since the war, but have instead joined factories or engaged in civilian professional work. It is difficult to say how many troops the Soviet Union has left after this demobilization. Premier Stalin announced last October that the Soviet Union had 60 divisions stationed abroad. He also said that after the fourth demobilization, the number of troops stationed in Europe would be reduced to 40 divisions. These figures do not include the number of domestic demobilized personnel and the number of troops stationed in the East. It is expected that if the international situation is calm, this demobilization order is not the last one, because demobilization is not only the wish of the Soviet Union, but also an urgent need.

### Churchill's Anti-Soviet Movement Not Supported by British Labour Party Executive Committee Passes Resolution

[Central News Agency London, 5th Special Dispatch] The British Labour Party Executive Committee has issued instructions to party members not to support the European Federation movement recently launched in London by Churchill. Labour Party Secretary-General Philippe explained this decision, saying that the future and progress of European peace depend on the success of the United Nations, so all depend on strengthening friendly cooperation between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union. Churchill has apparently excluded the Soviet Union from the European Federation plan. This is the policy of the committee led by Churchill. This policy, whether it is justified or not, can be interpreted as aiming to eliminate Soviet influence in Europe.

### Poland Under Soviet Control

— Translated by this newspaper's research department

Recently, the U.S. State Department issued a formal statement condemning the provisional government of Poland, believing that the recent general election held in Poland did not meet the spirit of democracy and freedom as guaranteed by the Yalta and Potsdam agreements. The current Polish government is primarily under the control of the Soviet Union. What exactly is the relationship between the Soviet Union and Poland? The following is a report from Warsaw by a correspondent for the "London Times Weekly," with extremely keen observations.

At the last United Nations General Assembly meeting, Gromyko proposed to investigate the military presence of various countries overseas. If an investigation is carried out, the number of Soviet Red Army troops in Poland should naturally also be included. Not long after the end of the war, the number of Soviet officers in the Polish army was extremely high, but it has gradually decreased. According to the report of the Polish Minister of National Defense and Commander-in-Chief of the Army, Rola-Żymierski, since June 1945, more than 14,000 Soviet officers in the Polish army have been successively withdrawn and returned to their country, including 40 generals. Currently, there are still quite a few Polish officers receiving training from the Soviet side in Moscow and Warsaw. Soviet officers remaining in the Polish army wear Polish uniforms, and in fact, many of them are of Polish descent.

Seaports and Airports

Although the seaports have nominally been returned to Poland, many important strongholds remain in Soviet hands. As for the airports, most are under Soviet control. Passengers taking civilian airlines can only stay in the waiting room and cannot take a single step beyond it. Polish officials admit that due to a shortage of aircraft and flight personnel, the training of Polish military and civilian aviation personnel must rely entirely on the Soviet Union. The aircraft currently used by Poland are also mostly made in the Soviet Union.

Domestic and Foreign Affairs

Under these circumstances, Poland naturally carries a very strong Soviet influence in both domestic and foreign affairs. In foreign affairs, Poland follows the Soviet Union's lead in all diplomatic gatherings. The main decision-makers of foreign policy in its government, namely Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Modzelewski and State Secretary Berman, are extreme communists, and everything naturally follows Molotov and Vyshinsky.

In domestic affairs, the most significant point is the secret police system. In Poland, we often hear accusations that Soviet officers are manipulating the secret police department, and that the director, Radkiewicz, is fundamentally Russian. These accusations are not very well-founded, because in fact, Soviet officers have nothing to do with the Polish secret police department. However, one thing is very clear: the power of this independent secret police system was copied from the Russians.

In purely domestic affairs, the Soviet Union has not interfered much. For example, Marxism is not promoted in schools, and foreign language electives, both Russian and English, are available at will and not compulsory. Railways, post offices, telecommunications, and other institutions are managed by the Poles themselves, and the Soviets do not participate.

Soviet Activities

Soviet embassy personnel and military representatives in Poland are generally very cautious, stay out of the public eye, and do not have much contact with the outside world, even the Soviet journalists in Poland are like this. On the other hand, cultural activities are very bustling, with Soviet films being shown everywhere and Soviet books being sold everywhere. The Red Army in Poland also publishes its own newspaper called "Free Daily," which is widely distributed in Warsaw, and its main goal is to promote the strength of the Soviet Union.

The gradual withdrawal of Soviet troops from Poland is to avoid stimulating Polish sentiments. The general Polish population does not have a favorable impression of the Soviet Union. Due to centuries of historical relations, the memory of Cossack and Tsarist brutality has not been erased. At the same time, Poles consider themselves to be of the "Western" race and look down upon the "Eastern" Russians to some extent. When Red Army officers go to Polish bars, the waiters' attitude towards them is quite indifferent.

Polish Attitudes

The attitudes of Poles towards the Soviet Union can be roughly divided into three categories: The first category is those who are trying their best to be pro-Soviet, which includes government leaders and those sent by the government. They believe that Poland must be closely linked with the Soviet Union, which is beneficial to Poland. The second category is those who recognize the need to unite with the Soviet Union, but do not feel that this is a blessing for Poland. Generally speaking, the middle class, liberal professionals, and upper-class farmers belong to this category. They support Pan-Slavism, but do not agree with the Soviet economic system. The third category is those who are vehemently opposed to the Soviet Union, which includes industrialists, landlords who have been deprived of their land, missionaries, and some armed opponents hiding in the forests. In addition, there is a group of Poles in exile who are also vehemently opposed to the current provisional government.

On the one hand, the Soviet Union is seizing this area and refusing to let go, and on the other hand, it is frequently sending out signals of goodwill, using it as a barrier to its west.

### An Eight-Year Account of Airplane Accidents in the United States, With More Than 440 Fatalities

[United Press International, Washington, 5th] From 1939 to 1946, the death rate of passengers on scheduled airlines in the United States was one passenger death per 3,466,755 miles flown, and one crew member death per 13,452,200 miles flown. This is based on mortality statistics from the Bureau of Safety Regulation and the Civil Aeronautics Administration's flight accident records. Although civil aviation in the United States began in 1930, there were no detailed reports. Domestic air transport only fully transitioned to the modern era after the Civil Aeronautics Act was established in 1938, so these statistics begin in 1939. Up to 1946, there were 36 airline plane crashes in eight years, with 355 passenger deaths and 90 crew member deaths. On average, one passenger died for every 52,120,550 "passenger miles" flown. (One aircraft flying one mile is one "aircraft mile," and one passenger traveling one mile is one "passenger mile." For example, if an aircraft carries 44 passengers and flies 100 miles, the record would be 100 "aircraft miles" and 4,400 "passenger miles." The records of passenger miles and aircraft miles from 1930 to 1938 are unknown, but it is known that a total of 205 passengers and 109 crew members were killed.) The changes in the design of commercial airplanes can be seen from the average number of deaths in each accident. From 1930 to 1938, there was an average of 2.75 passenger deaths and 1.45 crew member deaths per plane crash. From 1939 to 1946, due to the increase in the size of aircraft, the average death rate per accident increased to 8.33 for passengers and 2.43 for crew members. The first accident with more than ten passenger deaths occurred last January, when a plane crashed in Curtis, killing 14 passengers and three crew members. Although airlines represent the majority of passenger travel, they only make up a small part of the entire aviation industry, with their aircraft accounting for only one percent of civil aircraft in the United States. Last year, in addition to airline planes, there were 500 fatal accidents and 6,400 non-fatal accidents. Chartered and irregular flights had a total of eight fatal accidents, with 58 passengers and 23 crew members killed. According to reports from scheduled airlines, there were 22 accidents with no deaths last year.

### The Fire Case Opens the Tip Box: The Captain Brings His Wife to Fight the Fire, and a Woman With a Pockmarked Face Takes a Vase - Two Letters Are Prepared for Submission to the Court for Thorough Investigation

[Reported by this newspaper] The tip box for the Seymour Road fire case was opened publicly yesterday morning at 10:00 a.m. by Ke Kexin, chairman of the five-person investigation committee, and Zhang Nai'er, representative of the Senate. There were only two tip letters in the box, and upon opening and reading them, it was stated that there was a "firefighting wife" on the fire truck, which was truly outrageous. The other letter accused residents of taking advantage of the fire to loot. The investigation committee is prepared to submit them to the court for a thorough investigation. The two letters are listed below:

"When the Yichang Road fire brigade arrived at the scene of the fire, I saw two women in combat fatigues on the fire truck. At the time, I thought they were female firefighters, but later I heard that it was the wife of the fire captain. To this day, the matter is suspicious. I am reporting this matter to ask the authorities to thoroughly investigate what the intention was of the fire brigade bringing a woman. A neighbor surnamed Sun."

"I saw a woman, thirty years old, (living in a wooden house in Lane ____, Wuding Road), with a heavily pockmarked face (from having smallpox). That night, she took a vase and many other things from the fire scene and hurriedly moved east several times. My aunt told me that this woman lived in Qianyi Lane and that they used to run a firewood shop. My aunt often saw her when she went to buy firewood, but it's a pity my aunt can't remember her name, which is a real shame. (Not signed)"

Someone Proves that Two Policemen Helped With the Rescue

[Another report] Regarding the incident of policemen No. 1850 and No. 335 breaking into the fire scene, the investigation committee visited Chen Zhiqing, director of the Changning Road Police Sub-Bureau, his section chief Neng Yixichao, and patrol officer Xiao Zosheng yesterday afternoon. According to them, when a fire occurs, the police station, fearing that villains will take the opportunity to loot, sends officers to the scene to assist in maintaining traffic. However, their activities are limited to outside the fire scene and they cannot enter the fire scene without orders or special circumstances. After receiving the report on that day, the Changning Road Sub-Bureau sent six uniformed police officers and two plainclothes police officers to the fire scene to assist in guarding the area. However, policemen No. 1850 and No. 335 were not among them. Police officer No. 1850 was a patrol officer, and police officer No. 335 was a duty officer. If they were at the fire scene, it would be a clear case of abandoning their posts according to police regulations.

Director Chen said that if someone can prove that the two policemen did indeed enter the fire scene without authorization, they must be severely punished. The bureau has not only sent officers to search the homes of the two policemen, but has also escorted them to the Inspectorate of the Headquarters for investigation. However, according to Inspectorate Chief Zhang Da, who spoke to reporters yesterday, Yang Junshan and Yin Bingquan, who live at No. 3, Lane 660, went to the Headquarters to testify for the two policemen, saying that police officers No. 1850 and No. 335 were acting bravely and helping them rescue their property, and were definitely not "taking advantage of the fire to loot." As for the so-called "suspicious pockets," they were filled with towels for thirst relief. They also said that in addition to the two policemen mentioned above, officers No. 792, No. 1834, and No. 1833 also helped with the carrying. Since the police officers entered the fire scene, the police station must conduct a detailed interrogation. In addition to the first two who are being held, the latter three will also be questioned individually.

### A Citizen Even Submits a Letter

The Senate has also received a letter from a citizen regarding the Wuding Road fire, stating that the police work in this case must have been lacking, because if there were honest and conscientious police officers at the scene, the firefighters would never have been so undisciplined. It also stated that some victims received threatening letters after the incident, which must have been sent by those who participated in looting during the fire, and their handwriting should be compared, etc. Senate representative Zhang Nai'er has now submitted the letter to the investigation committee for investigation and improvement.

### Rumors Abound and Misunderstandings Increase - Firefighters Who Cherish Their Reputation Are All Discouraged - Everyone Is Preparing to Pack Up and Leave

[Reported by this newspaper] Fire Chief Zhou Zhaoxiang said yesterday that since the Seymour Road fire occurred, rumors have been rampant and misunderstandings have increased, causing those who usually cherish their reputation to feel discouraged and their work morale to be extremely low, and most of them are already preparing to "pack up and leave." After being hit by this incident, I have completely lost confidence in my work over the years. After the investigation of this case is over and the truth is revealed, I will resign to take responsibility.

Chen Qian, the district team leader of the Hongkou sub-team, has been involved in firefighting for more than 20 years. The scars on his left cheek are from burns he suffered ten years ago during the fire at the Yangzhou Road Power Company. To this day, his left eyelid is everted and bright red, and his mouth cannot be opened wide, so his voice is low. He was very emotional yesterday and told reporters: "We love this job and enjoy this job, so we have stayed in our posts for decades. However, the accusations from society have made us have to leave our posts." He was filled with emotion. Zhou Zhaoxiang finally stated that in the next session of the Senate, he will urge strict bans on lanes and vendors that do not meet building requirements. He also said that he would welcome local residents to assist in handling firefighting facilities, and he believes that improvements will be faster.

According to Xie Zhiyong, section chief of the Fire Department, the excessively low pay of firefighters is the biggest reason for the low work efficiency. Their current salaries range from 140,000 to 150,000 yuan to 200,000 to 300,000 yuan, making it difficult for them to maintain their personal lives, let alone support their families! Therefore, those who are currently working in the Hongkou District Fire Department are either old or young, and the young and strong have long since switched to other jobs. In the Central District Fire Brigade, there is a large turntable ladder truck, whose ladder can be raised to 150 feet high to put out fires in high-rise buildings. It is said that there are only four of these vehicles in the world, and this city owns two of them. The vehicle is heavy and difficult to maneuver, and only experienced people can drive it. It is pitiful that they have mastered such a unique skill, but their families are still in danger of freezing and starving. Chief Zhou showed reporters his tattered clothes covered with patches yesterday, and then said with a wry smile: "How will we spend the days ahead?"

### U.S. Civil Aeronautics Administration to Establish an Office in Shanghai

### Flying Tiger General Flies From Guangzhou to Shanghai - Well-Received During a Week-Long Trip South

After leaving Shanghai by plane on the 30th of last month for a week-long trip to the south, General Chennault returned to Shanghai by special plane from Guangzhou at 2:30 p.m. yesterday. During the week, he visited Guangzhou twice and inspected Liuzhou and Guilin after the war. The purpose of Chen's trip to the south was to inspect the situation in various areas of South China and the progress of the work of the Air Transport Brigade, and to urge the responsible persons to work actively. When he arrived in Guangzhou and Guilin, he was warmly welcomed by local senior officials and local people. In Guangzhou, Director Zhang [blank], Chairman Luo [blank], Mayor Ouyang [blank], Commander Xiang [blank], and more than 30 people from all walks of life went to the airport to see him off and looked forward to meeting again. The Air Transport Brigade currently has five aircraft, and other aircraft will continue to fly to Shanghai from Manila and [blank] Island. Chen is very concerned about the post-war recovery and relief work in South China and is willing to make the greatest efforts to achieve his goals. After a short stay in Shanghai, Chen may leave Shanghai again for official business.

More than 60 representatives from relevant agencies such as the Health Committee of the Municipal Senate, the Municipal Party Headquarters, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, police sub-bureaus of various districts, and district offices attended. Mayor Wu presided over the meeting, reporting on the significance of convening the Cleanliness Conference, which aims to jointly study the improvement of cleanliness in the city, and the results of the discussion will be promoted separately by the relevant agencies and organizations. The focus of today's discussion is on the removal of garbage. Director of Health Zhang Wei stood up to report on the general situation of garbage removal, saying that the Health Bureau has 12 proposed improvements for discussion. Attendees spoke enthusiastically, and as a result, the improvements were amended and passed. In addition, the Health Bureau will re-draft the various expenses for the year based on actual needs, and the amount of the deficit will be added as requested, and it was resolved in principle to pass it and send it to the Municipal Government for adoption and implementation.

### Work Insults Settled With Apologies

[Reported by this newspaper] After the Seymour Road and Wuding Road fire, citizens have many complaints about it, and the firefighters feel that there are misunderstandings on all sides. Moreover, they say that the media's accusations have had a great impact on their work. According to Team Leader Chen, at 8:00 a.m. on February 1st, a fire broke out at the Zhongnan Can Factory at No. 241 Xinji Road. When the fire truck heard the alarm and rushed to the rescue, the fire had been extinguished, but white smoke was still rising from the roof. At that time, it was determined that the remaining fire was still brewing in the roof mezzanine. Three firefighters and policemen were about to climb onto the roof to try to pry open the tiles and extinguish the fire, but an employee of the factory came out and interfered, preventing the firefighters from climbing onto the roof and using insulting language. Later, the firefighters asked him to go up to the roof with them and pointed out the fire that was still burning. At that time, the firefighters were all enraged. Later, the manager of the factory, Cai, apologized on the spot, and the matter was settled.

Xie Zhiyong, section chief of the Fire Department, also said that a similar incident occurred on Xinzha Road a few days ago. Because the current hoses are mostly old and dilapidated, the hose suddenly burst when the water came out. A young man watching next to it suddenly said: "This way, we can talk about the catty again." The firefighters could not stand the insult, so after the fire was put out, they brought him back to the Fire Department to prepare to send him to the police station for questioning to find out the truth. Later, Fire Chief Zhou Feixiang stopped them. Chief Zhou instructed his subordinates: "The facts are the best proof. There is no need to make a fuss." A storm was finally settled.

### The Rickshaw Puller Stabbing Case - Cheng Rongfang Withdraws the Lawsuit, But His Brother Suddenly Expresses Dissent - Whether or Not the Withdrawal Can Be Allowed Depends on Investigating the Injuries

[Reported by this newspaper] In the case of the American sailor stabbing the rickshaw puller, the District Prosecutor's Office filed a public prosecution in accordance with Article 277, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law for causing serious injury. The District Court had held a hearing, and the defendant, Rogers, had confessed to the crime without denying it, but claimed that it was out of self-defense. The victim, Cheng Rongfang, is still being treated in the Public Hospital, but his injuries are gradually improving. The defendant recently entrusted Yao Yongli and other lawyers to go to the hospital to reconcile with Cheng Yongfang. As a result, Cheng signed the withdrawal of the lawsuit. However, yesterday, Cheng Rongfang's elder brother, Cheng Rongquan, and his lawyers, Chen Zhenzhou and Lian Ze, filed a petition with the court, claiming that the previous withdrawal of the lawsuit was invalid, saying that Cheng Rongfang's signature was caused by coercion and fraud.

According to sources from the District Court, Cheng Rongquan's request to confirm the invalidity of the withdrawal of the lawsuit was delivered to the court at 10:00 a.m. Whether or not the request can be granted depends on whether Cheng Rongfang's signature was obtained through coercion and fraud. At the same time, the withdrawal of the lawsuit also needs to be investigated, and it will only take effect if the victim's injuries have indeed fully recovered. Otherwise, even if the victim himself agrees to a reconciliation, the defendant should still be held criminally responsible.

According to the prosecutor in charge of the case, the victim suffered serious injuries during the investigation of the case, so the prosecution was initiated in accordance with Article 277, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law, which is a non-private offense that cannot be withdrawn. If the victim's injuries improve and he is indeed able to fully recover, the Criminal Court can change the article of prosecution. If it is confirmed to be an ordinary injury case, then it is a private offense, and the victim can withdraw the lawsuit.

### U.S. Navy Club Finds New Location and Moves In

[Reported by this newspaper] The former Japanese Mutual Aid Association on Penglai Road in this city is currently leased by the U.S. Navy Club. The U.S. military authorities said that the lease of the club's address will expire on the 14th of this month. The Central Trust Bureau will allocate it to the Municipal Senate for use, and they have found a new address, the U.S. military club at the Racecourse on Mahou Road, and will gradually move in from today. However, the U.S. Navy Club said that there are many furniture and equipment to be selected, so they sent a letter to the Central Trust Bureau requesting that it forward to the Municipal Senate a request to extend the lease for one week or ten days after the expiration date so that they can completely clear out the address. However, according to the Municipal Senate authorities, the second general meeting of the association is about to be held, and the renovation and layout of the new address will also take considerable time, so they are considering whether to grant the request of the U.S. military authorities or shorten the time limit.

### Previously Arrested for Theft at He Yingqin's Residence, Young Thief Reoffends and is Caught Again; Both Thief and Stolen Goods Recovered in Just Twenty-Four Hours

[Our Newspaper's Report] Zhu Wenxiong, a native of Jiading, resides at 193 Maoming South Road, in a two-story Western-style house with an exquisitely decorated living room on the lower floor. Between 2:00 AM and 6:00 AM on the 5th, almost everything on display in the living room was stolen. This included a green English stone triangular table cover, a pink "Xiangnan" porcelain eagle, a crystal ball with a one-foot-wide red sandalwood base, a brownish-gold Bixi lion statue, ten pairs of ivory chopsticks, a silver fruit platter, two small red sandalwood inlaid ivory screens, four silver flower basket candy dishes, a complete set of scholar's stationery, and three tablecloths. The total value of these items is estimated at seven to eight million yuan.

After discovering the theft around 7:00 AM, a report was filed with the Lujiiawan Police Station at 11:30 AM, requesting an investigation. The Chief of the Zhao Branch immediately ordered Hao Jingyi, the Head of the Criminal Investigation Division, to investigate. He immediately printed missing item notices, and Division members like Dong Yixiang and Police Chief Weng Mingxun were dispatched. They first notified antique dealers, pawnshops, and jewelry stores. Plainclothes officers were stationed in the concentrated antique areas along Tongfu Road, Jing'an Temple Road, Guangdong Road, and Changbang Road. Around 2:00 PM, the branch received a phone call from Ma Afa, who runs an antique stall named after himself at the Guangdong Road Antique Market at number 226. He reported, "Around 10:30 AM today, at the Jincaiji Antique Store owned by my cousin Wang Congyi at number 202 Guangdong Road, I saw two unfamiliar men trying to sell a pink 'Xiangnan' porcelain eagle for three million yuan. After negotiating, I bought it for one and a half million yuan. Seeing that the stolen item notice from your branch listed a similar item, I suspect it might be the stolen one. Please come and identify it." Division member Dong, accompanied by the victim, went to the market and found Ma Afa. After showing the eagle, the victim confirmed that it was indeed the stolen item. Ma Afa was immediately taken to the station for questioning about how he discovered the stolen goods. Ma described the clothing and accents of the two suspects. After discussion, Head Hao and the others believed the thieves likely had other items to sell at the store, so they sent Ma Afa back to the store while officers were stationed there. Around 11:00 AM yesterday morning, two young men arrived – one in Zhongshan suit, the other in Western suit – carrying items to sell. The shop assistant signaled to the officers, who arrested both men and brought them in for questioning. Fingerprint checks revealed both had prior records. One was Zhu Yao, 24 years old, from Shanghai, unemployed, and with no fixed address. The other was Li Jun, 23 years old, from Zhenjiang, residing at 32 Meilan Lane, 598 Huangpi South Road, and running the Beiji Fruit Store at the intersection of Fuxing West Road and Ladu Road. Both confessed to stealing Zhu Wenxiong's belongings and revealed the location of the hidden loot. Officers escorted them to the Guangdong Road Antique Society at number 226, where the gold Bixi lion statue was found. At the Boguzhai store at number 53 Jiangxi Road, the crystal ball was recovered. The remaining items were found upstairs at the Beiji Fruit Store. They also confessed to committing a major theft at the residence of former Minister of Military Administration He Yingqin on Linsen West Road on February 20th of the previous year, for which they were apprehended by the police. From the time of the theft to the recovery of all the stolen goods, the case was solved in less than twenty-four hours, a truly remarkable feat. While Li Jun was in custody, a woman named Xie Jia came to visit him. It is said that Xie and Li are cohabitating, and Xie comes from a prominent family.

### Taikoo Wharf Dispute: Mayor Mediates, Decides Old Workers to be Reinstated; Registration and Review to Begin Today; Disruptions Will Be Strictly Punished

[Our Newspaper's Report] Yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, Mayor Wu met with worker representatives He Changzhi, Zhou Chengxiang, Hou Mengzhi, and worker legal advisor Lawyer Lin Youtong regarding the Taikoo Wharf labor dispute. Mayor Wu first stated that worker Zhou Ruisun's slander and obstruction of official duties have been handed over to the court for swift action and are unrelated to this case. Regarding the handling of this case, he had previously convened all relevant parties for mediation, and it was decided that all old Taikoo Wharf workers who could provide proof would be allowed to join the wharf labor union and work at Taikoo Wharf. The Social Affairs Bureau is responsible for handling the registration. However, in the past two days, workers have hesitated to register because they did not understand the government's good intentions in arranging for old workers to be reinstated. Now, the registration period has been extended, starting today. Failure to register will be considered as a waiver of rights. Lawyer Lin guaranteed full compliance. The Mayor also stated that if there are any doubts about the qualifications of old workers during registration, they can individually petition the municipal government for review. In any case, the cargo handling of Taikoo Company cannot be stalled indefinitely due to the worker issue. Therefore, starting today (the 7th), Taikoo Company must both begin cargo handling and conduct registration. Any continued obstruction or participation in disturbances by non-wharf workers will be strictly punished for inciting workers to violate government laws.

Old Workers Hope for a Reasonable Solution

Also, yesterday at 12:00 PM, representatives of the old worker leader Zhou Ruisun's side, including Zhou Chengxiang, Hou Mengfang, and Sun Wenfu, along with protecting lawyer Lin Youtong, held a reception for reporters on the ninth floor of the YMCA to report on the facts and the government's handling of the situation. Lawyer Lin also issued a three-point statement on behalf of the old workers: (1) Guarantee that all Zhou's workers will demand to return to work within the bounds of the law. (2) Wharf workers are managed by the government and have no employment relationship with Taikoo Company. (3) If a fair and reasonable resolution to this case cannot be obtained in the shortest possible time, all old workers will petition to the central government in Nanjing for relief. Finally, Lin appealed to the Municipal Party Committee and the Municipal Council to participate in the mediation work to seek a fair resolution and avoid making things worse.

### British Electric Tram Workers Dispute Over Wage Increases

[Our Newspaper's Report] The British Electric Tram Company had a labor dispute last March over base salary and year-end wage increases. After mediation by the Social Affairs Bureau, both parties drafted an adjustment form, which was submitted to the Social Affairs Bureau for approval. Now, a year has passed, and the workers have approached the company, claiming they have not seen a wage increase. The company replied that it was already included in the adjusted salary. The workers argued that it was not included, so they requested an explanation from the Social Affairs Bureau. The bureau is currently considering a response.

### Student and Teacher Steal Brother-in-Law's Clothes

[Our Newspaper's Report] Zhang Zhongche, a native of Sichuan, resides at 288 Tiantong Road, Hongkou, and serves as the accounting director at the Western Pacific Enterprise Company. His wife, Wu, has a younger brother, Wu Zhongyun, 15 years old, who lives with Zhang and is funded by Zhang for his education. He previously studied at Zhengbeng Elementary and Middle School at 215 Tangshan Road. A teacher at the school, Shi Ruoyang (32 years old, from Jinhua), got along well with Wu and often went out with him during his free time. Later, Shi was dismissed by the school for some reason, and Wu soon dropped out as well. The other day, at dusk, Zhang Zhongche and his wife went to the Grand Theater to watch a movie. Wu Zhongyun said he had already seen it and did not go. He then tricked the maid into getting the key, opened the door with Shi, entered his sister's room, packed all the valuable ornaments into a suitcase, and hired a car to flee. When Zhang and his wife returned after the movie, they discovered that valuable items such as diamond rings, suits, and fur coats, estimated to be worth fifty to sixty million yuan, had been stolen. Zhang reported the theft to the Hongkou Police Station. Division Head Shi and Division Member Jiang Tianfu investigated and apprehended Shi at the Mingda Cotton Cloth Store on Yalu River Road. Shi confessed that Wu planned to escape to Nanjing on the night train. The original investigating officers followed him to the North Station and arrested Wu, recovering all the stolen goods. Both were taken into custody and interrogated. They confessed to conspiring and stealing, and were handed over to the judicial authorities for prosecution.

### Smuggling Boat Seized, Salt Police Guarding the Boat Strangled to Death; Suspect Transferred to District Attorney's Office Yesterday

[Our Newspaper's Report] Yang Guangzhong, a sergeant in the fourth squad of the Shanghai First District Salt Affairs Office, led several salt police officers to Tangwan Lock and Jiangkou to investigate salt smuggling last December. On the first day, they seized 130 dan and 40 jin of smuggled salt. The next morning, they seized another 35 dan and a small wooden boat. Yang hired a large boat to transport the seized salt back to Shanghai. Because there were few boatmen available, Yang rowed the small boat himself. On the way, he met a man who looked like a villager, claiming to be Sun Qiuquan, who volunteered to row the boat for Yang. Yang happily agreed and let Sun into the small boat. Yang returned to the large boat and assigned second-class officer Yao Dunzuo to guard the small boat. Sun Qiuquan rowed the small boat very slowly, seemingly intentionally lagging behind. At the time, the wind and waves were very strong, so Sun claimed that the small boat could not move forward and anchored at the Jiangkou kiln pier for the night, while the large boat continued to sail. After returning to Shanghai, Yang Guangzhong felt that it was inappropriate to leave the small wooden boat anchored in the river overnight, so that night he sent someone to look for it. To his surprise, the small boat was nowhere to be found at the kiln pier. The villagers nearby were discussing it, with some saying that Yao Dunzuo had deserted and others saying that Yao had been murdered. After much investigation, it was learned that Yao Dunzuo had indeed been strangled to death with bare hands by Sun Qiuquan and his friends Pan Agen, Guo Hesheng, Li Shenghong, and others, who threw his body into the river and divided the smuggled salt on the boat before fleeing. Sun Qiuquan was soon arrested by the police, while the other three were on the run. The suspect was handed over to the District Attorney's Office yesterday. District Attorney Ding Tongjun questioned Sun Qiuquan and deemed that the suspicion of premeditated murder was significant, so he ordered him to be taken into custody.

### Military Officer Labors on the Battlefield, Daughter Almost Forced into Prostitution; Serendipitous Street Encounter Results in Joyful Reunion; Untarnished, She Happily Returns Home

[Our Newspaper's Report] Li Junqing, a 38-year-old young military officer from Tianjin, was originally stationed in Wuhu and recently transferred to Jiangsu. While passing through Shanghai, he took a casual stroll yesterday near the Zhucun Village on Liulin Road, Ba Xianqiao. He suddenly noticed a girl standing at the entrance of the alley. Upon closer inspection, he realized it was his daughter, Mao Mao (16 years old). Surprised, he inquired about the reason and the scene of human joy and sorrow unfolded.

Li Jun and his daughter came to Shanghai from the rear in February after the victory two years ago. They were separated in Songjiang. After asking friends to search in all directions, he finally found her in Suzhou. However, because his mission was not yet completed and he feared a repeat occurrence, he entrusted his beloved daughter to the care of his relative Aunt Hong in Tiaodang Lane, Suzhou. Over the year or so, he traveled to various places and was busy with military affairs. He only relied on letters to communicate with his daughter. Due to the continuous rise in prices, Hong's burden became heavier. On the 29th of last month, she entrusted her neighbor Mrs. Ma to bring Mao Mao to Shanghai to find a job for her with relatives and friends in Shanghai to cover daily expenses.

The day after arriving in Shanghai, Mrs. Ma discussed Hong's original intention with her close friend Zhao Zhang, who is the madam of Hanzhuang at number 39, Zhucun Village, Liulin Road in this city. After the introduction, Zhao saw that Mao Mao was intelligent, quick-witted, beautiful and attractive, and immediately took a liking to her, willing to take her in as an adopted daughter and remit all living expenses to Hong on a monthly basis. Although Mao Mao had only been in Shanghai for a short time, after being embellished by Hong, she was transformed into a modern girl. However, Mao Mao knew how to love herself, and fortunately Zhao Zhang had no unscrupulous intentions, so she has remained untarnished. This is truly commendable.

Yesterday at around 10:00 AM, Mao Mao was wandering around the entrance of the alley when she happened to meet her father, Li Jun. The unexpected encounter in a foreign land filled them with mixed emotions of sadness and joy, and they could not help but burst into tears. The father, unaware of the details, mistakenly believed that she had been abducted by bad guys, so he went to number 39 and dragged Zhao Zhang to the Taishan Police Branch, accusing her of interfering with the family. After an investigation, the whole story was revealed. However, Li Jun still did not believe it and insisted that the police send his daughter to the hospital for examination. The police approved his request and sent personnel to accompany Mao Mao to the Nanyang Hospital, where female doctor Li Zhenyi examined her and confirmed that she was indeed a virgin. Only then was he relieved of his doubts. However, Mao Mao now decided to return home with her father, so Zhao Zhang, although she loved the girl as if she were her own, had no choice but to watch them leave together, talking and laughing.

### Criminal Report on the Great Fire Case Transferred to the Court; Administrative Part Can Also Be Concluded This Week

After days of public investigation by the Investigation Committee on the Great Fire Case, various tasks have come to an end. The five-member Investigation Committee has collected all the most concerning criminal-related information and prepared a report, which was approved by Mayor Wu and ordered the Police Bureau to transfer it to the court for investigation and trial according to law. The administrative part is still under investigation and is expected to be completed within this week. In order to clarify the truth of the case to the public and the government's measures, the full text of the criminal part of the report is disclosed.

Ge Kexin's Remarks

According to Ge Kexin, Chairman of the Wuding Road Fire Investigation Committee, the members of the committee have obtained several pieces of physical evidence and more than sixty copies of transcripts and charts after several days of hard work. In addition, five firefighters and police officers have been sent to the court for trial, and two commanders have been suspended for investigation. Everything is open and there is no concealment. The authorities will quietly wait for the court to continue the investigation and handling. The outside world's concerns about "much ado about nothing" will naturally be dispelled. The remaining administrative part is still under investigation. If there are any weaknesses, we will never avoid treatment for fear of illness. It is expected that the municipal government will be able to work with all citizens to seek the improvement of fire control.

Full Text of the Report

The full text of the first report of the Wuding Road Fire Investigation Committee is as follows: It was found that at 9:30 pm on January 22, 1947 (the first day of the Lunar New Year), a coppersmith at No. 425 Wuding Road was careless, and the fire spread to the wooden house built on the east side of No. 29, Lane 660, Shaanxi North Road (formerly Seymour Road), adjacent to the west, and the Yongqin Rubber Factory at No. 423 Wuding Road, adjacent to the east. After receiving the alarm, the Fire Department first drove from the Jing'an Temple area to the fire scene on Wuding Road for rescue, around 10 o'clock; subsequently, fire brigades from the Central, Xinzha, Hongkou, Yichang Road, and other districts successively dispatched to rescue. Twenty minutes later, the fire at No. 425 and the wooden house at No. 29, Lane 660, adjacent to the west, and the Yongqin Rubber Factory, adjacent to the east, gradually subsided. Half an hour later, the third floor of No. 29, Lane 660, adjacent to the west, reignited, and the fire became uncontrollable. The fire then spread westward, successively burning down eight Western-style houses at No. 27, 23, 21, 15, 11, 5, and 3, Lane 660, Shaanxi North Road. The embers were completely extinguished at 1:00 pm on the 23rd. In total, the fire burned for fifteen hours, causing public uproar and spreading rumors. From January 29 to February 2, 1947, for five days, inquiries were made to the victims, neighboring witnesses, responsible officers of the fire brigade present on the day, and the US military fire brigade. Based on the information obtained, the following facts were determined:

Second Fire Is Highly Suspicious

(1) Outbreak of Fire—It was found that the initial fire started at the coppersmith's shop at No. 452 Wuding Road, and after spreading to the wooden house on the east side of No. 29, Lane 660, Shaanxi North Road, it was extinguished. About half an hour later, the third floor of No. 29 reignited. After on-site inspection, it was observed that the wooden house built by No. 29 only reached the second floor. The number of windows where it was connected to the original house of No. 29 only burned to the wooden frame of the window. There were no traces of burning near the inside of the window. The source of the second fire on the third floor of No. 29 seems to be speculation. Further investigation revealed that Huang Afu (also known as Huang Baogui), the driver of the Wang Yunfu family (i.e., No. 29), and what the neighbors saw, along with the traces of the fire scene, showed that the second fire clearly started on the third floor and then spread downward. According to the testimony of Wang Anai, the nanny of the Wang family, the windows and doors were closed at the time (see the transcript). Therefore, the cause of the fire on the third floor, whether it burned in from the outside or started inside, raises doubts.

Extortion of Gold Bars Not Substantiated

(2) Extortion of Gold Bars—(1) Yongqin Rubber Section: It was found that the rumor that the owner of the Yongqin Rubber Factory paid gold bars, so the firefighters tried their best to put out the fire and were spared from being burned, has been investigated. The owners of the factory, the Tong Keqin and Tong Kede brothers, and the workers in the factory all flatly denied it. Although this is one-sided and not credible, the factory is adjacent to No. 425, the fire point, and its location is slightly to the southeast. The wind direction on that day was from northeast to southwest, and the factory was upwind. The factory also had more than a dozen fire extinguishers, and five workers were applying rescue at that time. After the fire, the flat house at No. 425 collapsed instantly, so the fire was not spreading very fast in that area, and it was easy to extinguish, which is reasonable. It is difficult to immediately determine that the factory bribed with gold bars. (2) Wang Yunfu Section: It was found that the rumor that the firefighters extorted gold bars unsuccessfully, resulting in them letting the fire burn, is difficult to judge except for the victim's voluntary identification. After questioning many of the Wang family's masters and servants one by one, they all denied it.

Theft of Property Undeniable

(3) Robbery of Property—(1) No. 29, Lane 660, Shaanxi North Road Section: It was found that the Wang Yunfu family lost a large amount of gold and silver, and after questioning Wang Yunfu himself, his daughter-in-law Cheng Suying, and his daughter Wang Chuqin one by one, it can be known that Wang's daughter-in-law's jewelry and other items were indeed burned (see Cheng Suying's transcript). Most of Wang's daughter's jewelry was taken out, but three large gold bars are still missing (see Wang Chuqin's transcript). (However, this point still needs to be determined after excavation at the fire site). Wang Yunfu's silverware has been found, so the above rumors are not entirely credible. However, it was found that the three-door rosewood tree in Wang's wife's room was found to have been split after the incident. Zheng Daijian, a resident of No. 27, saw firefighters carrying two thermos bottles from the back door of No. 29 and going to Gordon Road (see the meeting minutes). Although these clues cannot determine what they robbed, their behavior of stealing property is undeniable. (2) No. 27, Lane 660, Shaanxi North Road Section: It was found that in No. 27, in addition to the four firefighters of No. 011, who were identified by Zhou Qihang as opening boxes and robbing towels, handkerchiefs, and other items in No. 27 on the morning of January 23, the firefighters themselves have admitted it and have been detained by the Police Bureau and transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for legal action. According to Zhou Qifang's testimony, there were five silver countertops, and two wooden boxes that originally contained the silver countertops and six wooden clothes racks hanging clothes on the second floor were found in the patio the next morning. Therefore, before the fire spread to No. 27 on the evening of the incident, there was indeed theft of property. (3) No. 11 and 15, Lane 660, Shaanxi North Road Section: Wang Yingjuan, a maid of Tang Ruichien, a resident of No. 11, once said, "A firefighter came to split the closet when the fire was burning at No. 27, and went upstairs to stop us from going up." There is a need to investigate whether it was necessary to enter between No. 27 and No. 11, which is separated by three Western-style houses. Moreover, he immediately cut down the tree with an axe upon entering the door. At that time, the fire had not yet spread, and there was no danger on the upper floor of the house. His illegal attempt is clearly visible when he hurriedly stopped the family from going upstairs. Song Zhipeng, a military policeman of the Foreign Affairs Group of the 23rd Regiment of the Military Police, said: "I saw a firefighter inside No. 15 splitting the closet door. Later I asked him what he was doing? He said nothing." Later I saw him take out candies and other items from the closet and share them with other firefighters." It is doubtful whether they opened other closet doors to steal items since the firefighters were not putting out the fire and were actually moving food inside the trees. Yan Zezhi, a resident of the house, said: "I found a set of uniforms in the garden the next day." In light of the aforementioned facts, it is suspicious whether the firefighters who entered No. 15 robbed property.

Why the Brawl Deserves Attention

(4) Fight in Dakang Lane—It was found that around 1:00 am on the evening of the incident, three or four firefighters initially fought on the roof of the carport at No. 31, Lane 660, Shaanxi North Road. Later, they continued to fight in Dakang Lane on Wuding Road for a quarter of an hour. This point has been consistently stated by witnesses Xue Jinan, Yue Guisen, Sun Chaoqun, Yang Bida, etc., so it is not a fabrication. At this time, they should have been working together to put out the fire, but instead, they were fighting each other. If there was no conflict of interest, it would not have happened, which deserves attention.

Unanimous Criticism of Ineffective Firefighting

(5) Ineffective Firefighting—It was found that the fire on Wuding Road lasted for fifteen hours and destroyed as many as eight Western-style houses. Regardless of the crude equipment and the immature fire-fighting technical training, it is an undeniable fact that the firefighters and officers of all levels on the scene failed to make efforts to put out the fire. The testimony of Wang Yunfu said, "They were not saving the fire but watching the fire," and the statements of other victims and witnesses were almost unanimous in their criticism. In particular, the US military said, "I saw at least twelve people standing by and watching," and the fact that the firefighters were drinking in the Juxing Garden at No. 446 Wuding Road (with wine bottles as evidence) and harassing the nanny at No. 11 (Wang Yingjuan's transcript) were more concrete.

Separate Opinions Formulated

Based on the above conclusions, in addition to the shortcomings in fire administration and technology and the points that should be improved, which will be reported in a separate document, the above facts all involve criminal and administrative punishments. The following opinions are hereby formulated separately: (1) Outbreak of Fire Section—It is proposed to transfer this information to the Shanghai District Prosecutor's Office of the People's Court for reference and special investigation. (2) Gold Bar Case Section—It is proposed to only use it as a type of report material for reference. (3) Robbery of Property Section—In addition to the four firefighters of No. 011, who have been detained and should be transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for legal action, the firefighters of No. 245, 76, 90, 360, 278, 348, 550, 586, 400, 184, 925, 102, and 12 who entered No. 29 on the evening of the incident, the squad leaders Zhu Qinglan and Zhou Yuehuan, the firefighters of No. 70, 164, and 2 who entered No. 27, the squad leader Huang Zhongxi, and three others, a total of seventeen people, are proposed to be transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for interrogation first. It is said that Xu Liren, the Central Squad Leader, has supplied Lian Zeng with access, and had met with Team Leaders Zhou Yue and Li, and also the Section Chief (see the transcript). In addition, the firefighters and their numbers who entered the two houses have not been reported. It is proposed to order the Fire Department to investigate and clarify them before sending them to the District Prosecutor's Office for interrogation. (4) Fight in Dakang Lane Section—It is heard from Director Zhou of the Fire Department that the people who fought in Dakang Lane have been found. It is proposed to order them to issue a list of names and transfer them to the District Prosecutor's Office for interrogation. (5) Ineffective Firefighting Section—It is proposed to hand this point over to the Police Bureau for a thorough and detailed investigation of the ineffective officers and police officers and give them the most severe administrative punishment. As for who did not make an effort? The US military said: The police officer at No. 101, Old Yichang Road, can be asked. Who are these twelve people? Who are the people who drank alcohol? In addition, the palace chiefs on the scene are also difficult to escape their responsibility. The above proposals, whether appropriate or not, should be transcribed into an investigation report together with the dossier and submitted for review. Respectfully submitted to Mayor Wu. Chairman of the Wuding Road Fire Investigation Committee Ge Kexin, members Zhang Da, Hou Junren, Zhang Shizuo, Pan Wenzhen.

### Public Works Bureau Plans to Solve the Housing Shortage; Continues to Build Public Housing; Renews the Previous Proposal to Borrow 100 Billion Yuan from the Central Trust Bureau; Special Letter to the Municipal Council Requesting a Prior Decision on Repayment Method

[Our Newspaper] The Municipal Public Works Bureau stated that the resolution of the Municipal Council's first general meeting on "Building Public Housing in various districts to provide housing for the people" has been studied, but it is difficult to implement due to lack of funds. A reply to the council briefly stated: "There are currently an estimated 60,000 squatter households in this city. To solve their housing problem, assuming that simple public housing is built in phases, the first phase of 10,000 buildings would require 20 billion yuan if each building costs 2 million yuan. Such a large amount of funding is definitely beyond the capacity of the municipal government. In desperation, we consulted with the Central Trust Bureau to allocate half or part of the 40 billion yuan for public school staff housing to build public housing, but the bureau stated that the public school staff housing plan handed over by the Four Allied Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration has not been decided, so it cannot give a definite answer. It has recently been learned that the bureau's plan has been finalized, and the cheapest type of housing is 10 million yuan. Therefore, the bureau's investment that our bureau hoped for has been disappointed." It also stated: "Our bureau is still planning to build this public housing. There are currently two ways to adopt: (1) Renew the previous proposal to the Central Trust Bureau to borrow 10 billion yuan in the form of acceptance to carry out the second phase of public housing construction. (2) Request the municipal government to establish a citizens' village management committee in advance to actively solicit construction funds and hand them over to the Public Works Bureau to build the third or fourth phase of public housing. As for whether the first loan is to be repaid in installments by the municipal government or by the citizens' village management committee, and whether it is to be built as relief, or still sold by building after completion, the council should decide in advance so that there is a basis for adopting the housing style."

### Advocating the Movement to Love and Use Domestic Goods; Council Sends Letters to People's Organizations

The Shanghai Municipal Council previously resolved at the second general meeting of the first session to initiate a movement to love and use domestic goods in order to rescue the city's industrial and commercial collapse crisis and cultivate citizens' thrifty habits. The council has sent telegrams to the Executive Yuan and the councils of various provinces and cities, and has sent letters to the municipal government and the Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters. Council Speaker Pan Gongzhan and Deputy Speaker Xu Jiliang have also taken the lead in sending letters to various people's organizations in Shanghai, requesting unanimous response. The originally set methods are recorded as follows: (1) Telegram to the Executive Yuan to strengthen the management of imported goods, prohibit the import of various luxury consumer goods, and increase the tax rate on various goods that can be made in the country to protect domestic industry and commerce. (2) Send telegrams to the councils of various provinces and cities to unanimously respond to the advocacy. (3) Send letters to the municipal government, the municipal party headquarters, and various people's organizations to formulate propaganda and implementation methods, and earnestly advocate and promote them. (4) Send a letter to the municipal government instructing all sectors of industry and commerce in the city to work together, improve quality, and reduce prices to increase production and sales and recover rights and interests.

From the 15th, the traffic police of the police bureau will check the vehicle licenses on various roads at any time. Once caught, they will still have to complete the formalities and be punished according to regulations.

### Stall Issues: Vendors from the Eleventh District Market Submit Opinions to the Council

[Report from Our Newspaper] Ju Zuyin and Weng Yongqing, representatives of the mutual aid association of stall vendors from the eleventh district market in this city, have submitted a letter to Speaker Pan of the Municipal Council, requesting that the authorities regulate the types of street vendors around the formal markets. Vegetable vendors should be a certain distance away from the market to avoid hindering the market's business. Their reasons are as follows: Open-air vegetable vendors are everywhere around the municipal Shanhai Pass Road market, which not only hinders the business of the formal market but also affects the appearance of the city and traffic. A request for prohibition was previously submitted, and a temporary solution was followed on January 8 of this year, in accordance with the mediation of Municipal Councilors Tang Shichang and Yan Sheng. The authorities have re-regulated the permitted stall areas for street vendors this year. If stalls are also allowed on nearby roads, the business within the market will inevitably be affected. Therefore, a special distinction is requested, such as allowing food stalls and department store stalls that do not interfere with the market's business. In this way, a fundamental solution can be achieved, and everyone can work in peace without disputes.

### Two Section Staff Members of the Municipal Government Suspected of Being Traitors: Rewarded for Informing the Enemy; Claimed to Be Poor and Fooled

[Report from Our Newspaper] The High Court heard the Han traitor suspect case involving Sha Jingchuan and Yu Ruzhong yesterday. Sha and Yu both worked in the accounting section of the Municipal Government before the war. In the 28th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1939], Sha served as a clerk at the Hong Kong Purchasing Office of the Resources Commission. In May of the 30th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1941], Sha returned to Shanghai. In August of the same year, both defendants joined the puppet organization and served as section staff members of the puppet Public Works Bureau. Sha then secretly reported to the enemy that the Resources Commission had secretly established a purchasing agency in Shanghai (i.e., Hengli Company at 515 Cishu Building), and Yu reported the file materials retained by the former Public Works Bureau in Shanghai to the enemy. This led to the seizure of all equipment and funds at the agency. Jiang Zhihua and others, the custodians of public property of the former Public Works Bureau, were also pointed out by Sha Jingchuan, and all forty-two boxes of public property secretly stored in the No. 1 Warehouse of the Shanghai Bank on Suzhou Road were seized by the puppet Public Works Bureau. Sha Jingchuan received a reward of 3,000 yuan in puppet currency, and Yu Ruzhong received a reward of 1,000 yuan in puppet currency. Sha had changed his name to Sha Keliang and was still retained as a section staff member in the Public Works Bureau of the Shanghai Municipal Government after the victory. Yu Ruzhong was still a section staff member in the Municipal Government. They were reported and sent to the High Court for legal action. Both defendants argued that they joined the puppet organization because they were under pressure from life and secretly reported central archives and materials because they were fooled by others. The court adjourned the hearing pending further investigation.

### Only One in China: Small Pocket Airplane; Can Take Off and Land Safely with Just Over 300 Feet of Open Space

[Special Report from Our Newspaper] Science is becoming increasingly developed, and human transportation is gradually trending toward air development. We can make a firm prediction: There will be a day when all kinds of airplanes shuttle back and forth in the air, just like cars and trains on the ground now. At that time, everyone can have the opportunity to own a plane and soar freely, shortening the concept of distance to the extreme. This non-fantastic vision has already begun to appear in aviation advanced countries. In China, it seems still a pipe dream, but at least we can already smell a bit of breath. Why?

Readers should still remember that a few days ago, China Airlines Flight 145 crashed in western Hubei. The only surviving foreign infant, Paul Vick, was transported from the countryside of western Hubei to Shanghai by a small plane sent by the company. What kind of plane is this small plane that doesn't necessarily need an airport and can land as long as there is a slightly larger open space?

Its name is Piper Cub. It is said that there is only one in China, brought by L.K. Taylor, the representative of Piper Company in China, as a sample. This is a single-engine plane with the wings on the upper part of the fuselage, and the rest of the shape is the same as ordinary planes. Its length, width, height and performance are as follows:

Length 22 feet 6 inches

Height 6 feet 10 inches

Wingspan 35 feet 5.5 inches

Net weight 1,000 pounds

Load 750 pounds

Oil storage 38 gallons

Fuel consumption (normal speed) 6.5 gallons per hour

Normal speed 103 kilometers per hour

Maximum speed 115 kilometers per hour

Take-off distance 480 feet

Landing distance 360 feet

The interior of the fuselage can seat two people besides the driver. The machinery in the cockpit is not as complicated as that of a large airplane. The various meters are slightly more than those in a car, and can be seen at a glance, but they are all-inclusive, with radio and blind flying equipment. It is said that this kind of plane is widely used by civilians in the United States, because it only needs an open space about 300 meters long to take off and land, and it is very easy to drive. Taylor said that anyone can fly after two weeks of training. During the war, the US government also used this small plane as a tool for training pilots.

Taylor is an aviation expert who has been in China for half a year, but his negotiations with the Chinese government to promote Piper Cub have not yet yielded results. He frankly admits that selling this plane is a business task, but he sincerely expresses that he really hopes to help the development of China's civil aviation industry. He said that although news of airplane accidents around the world has been frequently reported recently, aviation safety is generally improving. Currently, on average, there is only one accident for every 8 million kilometers flown by each passenger. Aviation in various countries around the world is advancing rapidly. If China does not catch up quickly, it will inevitably lead to its demise. Compared with the current figures, there are 250,000 pilots in the United States, and less than 500 in China. The United States has nearly 10,000 airports, while China currently has only dozens that can be used. Taylor believes that after Piper Cub is introduced to China, it can not only develop civil aviation, but also be very useful for training pilots in case of emergency.

Piper Cub currently costs only $3,500 US dollars per plane, which is cheaper than a car. It is expected that once the government allows imports, small planes like this will be seen everywhere in the skies above China's fields and cities.

### Southern Transport of Yarn and Cloth: February Quota Determined; Textile Control Committee Approves Adjustment of Cotton Yarn Purchase Prices Due to Rising Prices

[Our Newspaper Report] The 23rd regular meeting of the Textile Control Committee was held at 5:00 PM yesterday in the Municipal Government Conference Room. Chairman Wu, Deputy Chairman Li, Committee members Wang Yangxian, Wang Qiyu, Wu Weijing, Tang Xinghai, Guo Dihuo, Rong Yixin, and Liu Wenteng, Director of the committee's business department, were present. Liu Jingji and Tong Runfu were also present. The meeting adjourned at 6:30 PM.

Yesterday's meeting resolved four major issues: (1) The approval of southern transport permits for yarn and cloth in February will continue as before. According to statistics, the cotton yarn balance from January is 2,579 bales, plus the February quota of 2,967 bales, resulting in a February cotton yarn southern transport quota of 5,546 bales. The cloth balance from January is 57,652 bolts, plus the February quota of 75,647 bolts, resulting in a February cloth southern transport quota of 133,299 bolts. In addition, the southern transport of yarn and cloth handled as special cases includes a cotton yarn balance of 400 bales from January, plus the February quota of 2,000 bales, totaling 2,400 bales. The cloth balance from January is 24,679 bolts, plus the February quota of 35,000 bolts, totaling 59,679 bolts. (2) The originally set highest price list for the purchase of cotton yarn of various counts was incomplete, so the following additions were made: (Unit: Thousands of yuan) 8-count: 1,184 yuan; 12-count: 1,496 yuan; 14-count: 1,616 yuan; 20-count double-ply: 2,082 yuan; 21.5-count: 2,098 yuan; 22-count: 2,145 yuan; 26-count: 2,462 yuan; 33-count: 3,003 yuan; 30-count triple-ply: 3,048 yuan; 40-count double-ply: 4,018 yuan; 60-count: 5,691 yuan; 80-count: 7,937 yuan; 84-count: 8,334 yuan. The prices of all the above yarn counts are still calculated based on a ratio of 1,975,000 yuan for 20-count yarn. (3) The packaging standard stipulated in the cotton yarn purchase price is limited to machine-packed large bales. However, some factories also use straw bales for packaging. The labor and material cost for machine-packed large bales is 25,840 yuan per bale, while the labor and material cost for straw bales is only 9,310 yuan per bale. Therefore, the purchase price for straw-packed bales should be reduced by the difference of 16,530 yuan per bale. (4) Due to recent price increases and increased production costs, the original purchase prices are no longer sufficient and will be adjusted. The adjustment percentage will be studied by the evaluation committee of the six district cotton textile associations, and the Textile Control Committee will then discuss and decide on the percentage. (Note: The members of the evaluation committee include Wu Weijing, Jiang Dixian, Liu Jingji, Tong Runfu, and Cheng (name missing).)

### Sharp Rise and Rapid Fall of Bituminous Coal Prices

Public Association's Application for Allocated Coal Approved

The bituminous coal market initially opened with traders who had previously shorted to customers still raising prices to cover their positions, resulting in continued prosperity in the market. The highest transaction price for Kailuan train lump coal reached a peak of 850,000 yuan, and Kailuan No. 1 reached 750,000 yuan. Subsequently, due to the high market price, large traders sold off their holdings. The public association also received news that their application for allocated coal had been approved, totaling 20,000 tons of coal allocated for various private factories. The first batch for flour factories has already been distributed. Coal traders were allocated 8,000 tons of coal, including 2,000 tons of white coal and 6,000 tons of bituminous coal. As a result, buyers adopted a wait-and-see attitude, and the market situation took a sharp turn for the worse. Market prices gradually declined, with Kailuan train screened lump coal at 800,000 yuan and Kailuan No. 1 fines at 680,000 yuan, with no buyers. Very little domestic white coal arrived. Due to foreign exchange and import restrictions, the cost of imported coal was high, and the amount of arrivals was also small. The market situation remained firm.

A total of 6,930 bags of Saigon rice were allocated, with prices remaining unchanged. The situation for silver yuan and shadow yuan is also calm. Little japonica rice is available outside the market, and transactions are rare. The oil market is experiencing severe fluctuations. Telegrams from Qingdao report rising prices, and market sentiment is optimistic. Crude oil is up by 3,000 to 4,000 yuan, and refined rapeseed oil is up by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan. Soybean oil is scarce and in high demand. Northeast soybeans have not yet thawed, and arrivals are scarce. There have been few arrivals along the Longhai Railway recently. Oil factories, both in the city and in other regions, are still actively purchasing, and the market situation is one of demand exceeding supply, with successive peaks and soaring prices of 3,000 to 5,000 yuan. Soybean cake prices are also rising due to the continued increase in raw material prices. The demand from Shantou and Xiamen remains strong, with another jump of 1,200 to 1,300 yuan. The owners of foreign starch are holding firm, with a rebound of over 1,000 yuan. Domestic starch is average. Bran prices continue to fall by 200 to 300 yuan. Mung bean prices are rising by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Very little corn is arriving, and prices are up by 3,000 to 4,000 yuan. Red sorghum is selling well, with prices increasing by 3,000 to 4,000 yuan.

Edible oil prices are rising, with soybean oil at 220,000 yuan on the black market, crude oil at 195,000 yuan, and rapeseed oil at 175,000 yuan.

### Observations on Import and Export Industries After the Implementation of Export Subsidy Measures

Significant Results May Be Achieved in the Short Term, but Gradual Price Increases Will Still Be Insufficient

[Our Newspaper Report] After the announcement of the export subsidy measures, the general public is paying close attention. According to a person in the export industry, the provisions of these measures can be regarded as a great stimulus to China's nearly stagnant export business. The 100% subsidy system may achieve considerable results in the next one or two months. However, the high cost of domestic labor and the rising prices of export goods cannot be ignored. Among China's major export products, such as silk, tea, pig bristles, tung oil, cow and sheep hides, and medicinal materials, the pig bristle industry, due to high labor costs and price cuts by large buyers, had already seen 50% of the industry on the verge of bankruptcy before the export subsidy system was established. After the implementation of the subsidy measures, it is inevitable that workers will take the opportunity to request higher wages. In recent days, pig bristle prices have already risen by about 20%. If this situation cannot be improved, the 100% export subsidy may be gradually offset by the rising prices of export goods. Furthermore, regarding the export of tung oil, previously, due to foreign exchange reasons, transshipment through Hong Kong to foreign countries could yield more than 20% profit. With the current subsidy measures, tung oil seeking a way out through Hong Kong may change course and return to Shanghai. The exports of other silk, tea, and medicinal materials will also flourish. Therefore, the export subsidy measures have both advantages and disadvantages. At present, they are regarded as an emergency measure, and their future effectiveness is unpredictable. According to the Import and Export Association, the provisions of the subsidy measures can currently stimulate China's export business. However, with the unstable domestic situation and gradually rising prices, even if the export subsidy is set at 200%, it may be offset by high prices. Therefore, this measure is only regarded as an emergency measure, and its future cannot be viewed with absolute optimism.

### Central Trust Bureau Meeting Decides on Allocation of Rayon, Temporarily Limited to the Silk Weaving and Ribbon Weaving Industries

[Our Newspaper Report] The Central Trust Bureau, acting as an agent for the government's Materials Committee, convened a meeting yesterday morning at 10:00 AM to discuss the allocation of rayon. Wang Zijian and Yang Pansheng from the bureau were present, along with Liu Qingyi and Song Baolin from the silk weaving industry. Mr. Wang Zijian gave a report stating that after the trade with Japan, the Central Trust Bureau successively received three batches of Japanese rayon: the first batch of 4,150 cases, the second batch of 4,850 cases, and the third batch of 6,000 cases, totaling 15,000 cases. The Central Trust Bureau's allocation situation is as follows: 7,064 cases for the silk weaving industry, 384 cases for the ribbon weaving industry, 108 cases for the knitting industry, and 296 cases for the dyeing and weaving industry. In other regions, 500 cases were allocated to Tianjin, 510 cases to Shengze and Suzhou, 1,225 cases to Hangzhou, 9 cases to Wuxi, and 8 cases to Huzhou. A total of 10,104 cases have been allocated to the city and other regions, with 4,896 cases remaining. Subsequently, Mr. Yang Pansheng reported that the amount of Japanese rayon imported into China in the first half of this year through trade with Japan may decrease because the production of one pound of rayon in Japan requires two pounds of salt, and Japan currently lacks salt. Therefore, the rayon production may decrease. However, it is hoped that production can be increased in the second half of the year. The authorities are currently planning to transport more salt to Japan for trade. The fourth phase of rayon for trade is currently under negotiation. The Central Trust Bureau has now decided to allocate the existing stock to meet the needs. Finally, the silk weaving industry expressed the hope that the Central Trust Bureau would continue to allocate rayon. After discussion, it was decided that the rayon needed by the silk weaving and ribbon weaving industries would still be allocated by the Central Trust Bureau as usual, while the knitting and dyeing and weaving industries would be temporarily suspended. Starting next week, the silk weaving industry will be allocated one-fifth of its requested amount first. The ribbon weaving industry is still under review, and the allocation date will be determined later. The allocation price will remain unchanged. It is reported that the silk weaving industry is willing to guarantee that the allocated goods will not flow into the black market in the future. The industry has also notified all members that those who have not previously completed application forms should submit them to the association by noon today so that they can be compiled and sent to the Central Trust Bureau for application.

### Principal Uses Fire as an Excuse, Lies That Tuition Fees Were Burned

The Municipal Education Bureau is Conducting a Thorough Investigation

[Our Newspaper Report] The Shaanxi North Road National School in this city suffered a fire on the first day of the Lunar New Year, with considerable losses, as reported in previous newspapers. It has now been learned that Chen Suyun, a teacher at the school, revealed the news in the Wenhui and Dagong newspapers the night before, accusing the school principal, Pan Wenzhen, of not making financial matters public on a regular basis.

### Random Jottings on the Sidelines of Basketball

Chun Mao fought the Giants, emboldened by victory and with remaining courage, creating a leading situation all the way. In the second half, they still took the lead by three points with 14 to 11, but the victory ultimately turned into defeat. A pity!

Chun Mao's center Liu Yu-fu was a great hero of yesterday's game. One person was used as two, attacking and defending, never leaving the bottom line. The balls under Chun Mao's basket were not taken away by the "Giants." This was the reason Chun Mao was in the lead in the first half.

Zheng Jia-biao was the culprit for Chun Mao. He repeatedly missed free throws, otherwise Chun Mao would have taken the lead by at least six points, and their morale would have been boosted, leading to a different situation.

I ran into Mr. He Jin-gui before the game. According to him, he had just recovered from a serious illness and still needed to rest. He hopes to be able to play in a month or two. Mr. He lost two pounds of weight during this illness, which is quite a loss.

The Giants have skilled ball-handling and are tall and strong, truly a major concern for our Chinese team. (Changnian)

In the second quarter, Snow White launched a full counterattack, forcing a tie at 14 points. Later, Zhang Xiu-li scored a free throw, and Wang Hui-lin scored under the basket. Snow White came from behind, leading 20 to 16 in the first half. Changing sides and fighting again, Women's Youth Purple's Jian Zhi-guang scored continuously with free throws. Seeing the momentum was fierce, Snow White quickly rose to meet the challenge. Zhang Xiu-li scored with throws and free throws, and Wang Hui-lin added the finishing touch, making it 25 to 18. Women's Youth Purple called a timeout and substituted Chen Hua-xing for Jian Zhi-guang, launching a counterattack. Wang Wu-li shot accurately from long range. At the end of the third quarter, Snow White still led remotely with 31 to 20. In the final quarter, Snow White's Zhang Xiu-li scored two points in a row. Wang Wu-li, in desperation, shot from afar and hit the bullseye. Snow White's Zhang Xiu-li made another record. Women's Youth Purple was at a loss. As the buzzer sounded, Snow White won a great victory over Women's Youth Purple with 43 to 22.

The Game is Tense, Chun Mao Takes the Lead

In the final game, Chun Mao faced the Giants. The battle was quite tense. The man-to-man marking tactics were excellent. Chun Mao took the lead in the first half. Later, the Giants adopted central breakthroughs and mid-range long shots, which inflicted fatal damage on Chun Mao. After the start, both sides' defenses were extremely tight. Five minutes later, the foreign player Funk leaped up and made the first goal. Chun Mao's Liu Fu-shan returned the courtesy. Liu Fu-qiang made a single-handed push but was blocked by Yalong, scoring one of two free throws, leading 7 to 2. The Giants desperately counterattacked. Gu Fu first scored a free throw. Gu Fu held the ball, and Tao Bolinji also made some progress, tying the score at 7. Chun Mao's Zheng Jia-biao entered the game, replacing Huang Tian-lie. Their momentum suddenly increased. Liu Fu-shan and Zheng Jia-biao each made some progress. The foreign player Gu Fu made a long shot. Liu Fu-shan also scored a free throw. Yalong skillfully hit the bullseye. The first half ended with 11 to 12, the Giants trailing by one point.

The Giants Come From Behind and Win

Changing sides and confronting each other, Fu-qiang placed the ball into the basket. Pigu Nai responded in kind, 14 to 14, another tie. Then it became a 17-point tie again. The Sassi brothers each attacked with central breakthroughs. The Giants' momentum greatly increased, and they launched a full-scale attack, 28 to 21. Chun Mao saw that they were falling behind for the first time. Fu-shan tried several long-range attacks without success. Chun Mao's momentum was frustrated. In the last four minutes, 30 to 21, Chun Mao fell further behind. The Giants' Tao Bolinji turned around and supported the ball into the bullseye. Gu Fu scored a free throw. N. Sassi made a mid-range shot. Chun Mao's Liu brothers attacked, but both failed, only scoring one free throw each. As the buzzer sounded, 35 to 23, Chun Mao was miserably defeated by the Giants.

### Aerial Relief to Western Hebei

— Our Newspaper’s Tianjin Reporter Li Shaolin

Tianjin, January 30th (Air Mail)

Due to various difficulties and transportation inconveniences under the Communist army's blockade, the post-war relief work in Western Hebei has not been able to begin. Not only has the continuous war on the northern section of the Pinghan Railway cut off the route for transporting supplies, but also the Communist Party's prejudice against the Executive Relief Administration (行總) is a major reason why relief work cannot be promoted. With the arrival of the cold winter, the need for relief in Western Hebei has become even more urgent. Poverty, which was not created in a day, means that in the desolate and barren Western Hebei, almost every household is struggling without food or clothing. The United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) and the Executive Relief Administration deeply recognize the necessity of relief work in this area. After many days of effort, they finally obtained the understanding of the Communist side and were able to launch relief work in Western Hebei. Regarding the transportation of relief supplies, the Executive Relief Administration signed a contract with the U.S. military to use U.S. aircraft to assist in transportation by aerial dropping. This matter was successfully supported enthusiastically by Commander Howard and U.S. Air Force Commander Sanderson, and was announced on January 28th.

Dropping Supplies

Regarding the implementation of relief work, UNRRA sent five American staff members in advance, namely Dr. Osbeck, Mr. Corbic, Mr. Xie Ling, Ms. Doyle, and Ms. Candell, to Western Hebei to make arrangements in advance. The relief area and the dropping target were selected as Fuping County in the Taihang Mountains, and then transferred to other areas from there. The departure point will be loaded from Beiping after the Tianjin side has completed the transportation of supplies. The U.S. military has allocated three C-46 transport aircraft to assist in completing this task. According to the person in charge of the UNRRA Tianjin office, the relief supplies to be airlifted to Western Hebei this time from Tianjin include 1,800 packages of winter clothing, 1,700 blankets, 700 packages of clothing, 1,781 packages of Chinese-style cotton-padded clothes. From Beiping, there are 828 packages of winter clothing, 1,206 small packages of old winter clothing, 768 original packages of winter clothing, 97 packages of blankets and bedding, 1,000 sets of cotton-padded clothes, and 16 boxes of medicines. Starting from the 28th, three aircraft will be dispatched twice a day, morning and afternoon, and are scheduled to complete the transportation in two weeks. The aircraft transportation fee is 65 U.S. dollars per hour.

First Dispatch

The 28th was the first day of aerial delivery. After one dispatch in the morning, the dropping went very smoothly. For the second flight in the afternoon, Tianjin reporters obtained permission from the U.S. military to accompany the flight and observe from the air. Reporters from various newspapers gathered at the Zhangguizhuang Airport in Tianjin. First, they were led by the Executive Relief Administration staff to visit the temporary warehouse inside the airport. All the supplies to be transported had been concentrated here through the day and night care of the organizers. After the visit, the first transport aircraft dispatched returned successively at around 12:00 noon. They arrived safely over Fuping at 10:20 AM, identified the target and dropped the first batch at 10:45 AM, and completed the dropping at 11:07 AM. When the first dispatch was made, Gu Deming, Deputy Director of the Executive Relief Administration's Pingjin Branch, Yang Jin-kui, person in charge of the UNRRA's Pingjin Office, and General Howard, Commander of the U.S. Marine Corps in China, were all present to take care of it. This dropping was obviously taken seriously by all parties.

Second Dispatch

The second dispatch was at 2:00 PM. After the reporters filled out their names, reported their weight, and signed a waiver, they boarded the plane one after another. The plane then took off and soared westward. The bustling streets of Tianjin disappeared from sight, followed by the picture of the great plains of Hebei unfolding. Looking down, the earth was crisscrossed by fields, and melted snow turned into ice. The dry tree branches stood stiffly on the ground, making it even more calm and lonely. At 2:30 PM, the three aircraft successively flew over the Taihang Mountains. The snow on the shady side of the mountains had not melted, and the peaks were clustered together. Sparse villages were scattered in the valleys, which made people imagine its barrenness and hardship. After arriving at Fuping, the driver quickly discovered the dropping mark indicated by the white flag in the mountains. Then the plane dived down and descended to a low altitude of 250 meters. At this time, the U.S. military personnel on the plane had fastened their bodies with ropes and pushed the packages out of the cabin door. After circling four times, all the items carried were dropped. At that time, from the plane, it could be clearly seen that those packages were falling straight to the ground. There were more than a hundred people dressed as farmers standing there, with more than a dozen mule carts beside them, presumably waiting to collect these relief supplies.

Returning from Western Hebei

At 4:10 PM, everyone flew back to Zhangguizhuang Airport in Tianjin safely, and all breathed a sigh of relief, but could not help but miss the barren Western Hebei. The people of Western Hebei are poor. Judging from the relief work in other Communist-controlled areas, the Communist Party often fails to distribute relief supplies in the manner prescribed by UNRRA and the Executive Relief Administration. Whether these relief supplies, which cost a lot of manpower and material resources from China and abroad, can be reasonably distributed to every person who really needs relief cannot but make people worry.

### Carrying New Hope in the Flames of War, Haimen is Advancing

— Ding Yi

Haimen, Northern Jiangsu, 20th

The victorious and eventful thirty-fifth year has slipped away in the flames of war. Just as the thirty-sixth year is approaching, everyone will have new hopes. Haimen, Northern Jiangsu, located in the Yangtze River Delta and separated from Southern Jiangsu by only a river, has very convenient land and water transportation, and its culture is also considered developed. Although it cannot compare to the wealthy counties in Southern Jiangsu, its population of over 600,000 can generally be self-sufficient with its local products. Apart from a few foods that need to be imported from other ports, an average of 10,000 to 20,000 piculs of miscellaneous grains can be exported each year to supply other counties. Originally, this winter season should have been a long period of rest for them to recover their tired bodies and minds. However, due to years of misfortune, this comfortable paradise has become full of sores and is waiting to be rebuilt. The common people are also gasping for breath. After the victory, everyone eagerly hoped that the government would restore order as soon as possible, so that they could live and work in peace. However, in the past year, due to the rebellion of treacherous bandits, raging flames of war have been ignited in various parts of Northern Jiangsu. Various inhumane struggles, killings, and frame-ups have been launched. Rotten corpses and the pungent smell of blood are everywhere. Haimen has also suffered an unprecedented catastrophe due to the chaos caused by the bandit army. The common people are disappointed, especially those trapped in the bandit areas. Under the intensified oppression of the treacherous bandits' "land redistribution," "rent reversal," "emancipation," "liquidation," and other atrocities, it is truly a dark and hopeless situation. Millions of compatriots are forced to flee to foreign lands, eating wind and dew, crying from hunger and cold, looking at their hometowns from afar, and shedding tears in the wind.

Relieving the People from Suffering, Recovering the Outskirts of the County Seat

The surrounding bandit army still threatens Haimen, keeping Haimen in a state of tension and anxiety. Especially two months ago, when Magistrate Liu was about to be transferred, the bandit army around Haimen became even more restless, seizing territory, destroying property, and constantly threatening. They even gathered thousands of troops on a large scale and captured the outer strongholds of Tianbu and Batou towns, which were only a dozen miles away from the county seat of Haimen, in one fell swoop. Dahong Town also fell one after another. On the one hand, the treacherous bandits plundered the people's blood and sweat, loading them onto large and small boats and carrying them away. At the same time, they forcibly pulled away young and strong men, some of whom were slaughtered, others were used to replenish their ranks, and young women were also abducted to serve as the bandits' "comfort women." At that time, Haimen was already in imminent danger, and the people were in a state of extreme panic. This was the most tense period in Haimen's situation. At this time, the newly appointed Magistrate Xie Tingsheng arrived amidst a warm welcome from all walks of life. As soon as Magistrate Xie took office, he first recovered all the outer towns of Tianbu and Batou on the outskirts of the county seat. The restless hearts of the people of Haimen gradually calmed down. He further strengthened the public security of the county seat of Haimen and gradually restored the turbulent social order of Haimen.

Five Hundred Remnant Bandits Launch an Attack Without Success

On the sixteenth of last month, on a rainy morning, the remnant bandits became restless again, regrouping and launching a large-scale, crazy attack with more than 500 troops on Batou Town, ten miles north of the county seat. The security team and militia stationed there were completely surrounded and were about to break into the stronghold. The situation was extremely critical. When Magistrate Xie received the report, he immediately dispatched the National Army, security teams, and home-returning teams to provide reinforcements. In order to encourage morale and ensure the safety of the people, he personally went to the front line to command, accompanied by Ning Jiayu, the battalion commander of the Second Battalion of the Independent First Regiment of the National Army, and Staff Zhang of the Pacification Command. Under his heroic supervision, after a day of fierce fighting, the invading bandit army was completely defeated. The people rejoiced and celebrated when they heard the news.

The National Army Launches a Surprise Attack, Adding a Barrier to the Eastern Border

The Independent First Regiment of the National Army here has been stationed in Haimen for more than half a year since it entered in mid-May last year. The regiment has a total of three battalions: the first and second battalions were ordered to station in Qidong in November last year, and the first battalion remained to defend Haimen. Battalion Commander Ning Jiayu is a straightforward, brave, and valiant man who is very strict in his instruction and management of his soldiers. Usually, it is almost impossible for us to see their soldiers on the road. Almost some people do not even know that there are National Army troops stationed here. Occasionally, when they see one or two soldiers buying things in the market, they are always kind and friendly to the common people, fully expressing their intimacy. Therefore, none of the people here do not have a special affection for them. However, they are the ones who are active on the front lines during combat. It can be seen that their good military discipline and strong combat power are indeed commendable. Half a month ago, the National Army unit was ordered to cooperate with the Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth District Township Self-Defense Forces and the Guerrilla Team of Haimen to station in Haifeng Town. At that time, the treacherous bandits gathered more than 2,000 troops and completely surrounded them at 10:00 PM. The National Army was forced to defend itself and responded calmly. After a whole night of fierce fighting, until dawn the next morning, the National Army finally bravely broke through and launched a surprise attack, and finally defeated the bandit army. In this way, a majestic barrier has been added to the eastern border of Haimen, opening up the difficulties for the restoration of the entire territory.

Launching County Administration, Hope for the Restoration of the Entire Territory

In order to completely eliminate the bandit army within the territory, ensure the outer strongholds, and consolidate local security, the county government, in addition to strengthening the original strongholds in Tianbu, Sanhe, Batou, and other towns, has successively recovered the important stronghold of Dahong Town and established important strongholds in Changle, Changxing, Samsung, and other towns. They have been supervising and urging the security teams to work with the National Army to sweep away the remaining bandits in the territory and launch a cleanup operation.

Recently, the Haimen County Government, in order to cooperate with military progress and promote the restoration of the entire territory, has successively ordered the administrative personnel of each district, township, and town, as well as the self-defense teams and security teams of each district, to cooperate with the National Army to advance within their respective districts. The areas that have now been stationed in can control the entire county's tens of miles of long coastal area to the south, and the area within 40 miles to the northwest bordering Nantong. They have all advanced, and to the east, they have also advanced to the outer lines of Qilin Town, 50 miles away from the county seat, and Sanyang Town, 70 miles away, building strong fortresses on the outer periphery, and gradually repairing the traffic routes within the controlled area. The highways that have now been repaired and opened to traffic include the Tonghai Highway to Nantong, the Maochao Highway to Erjia Town, and the highway to Sijiaba. These highways can all be unobstructed. Under the strengthened protection of the government army, traffic security is quite stable. The Haiqi Highway can now directly reach Qilin Town, and it will soon be fully opened, and telephones have also been installed along each highway. The common people can now freely walk on the wide roads.

At this time of year when the seasons are renewed, it is expected that the restoration of the entire territory can be expected soon.

### Widespread Vaccination: A Pioneer of Medical Science, The First Step in the Fight Against Germs

— Qian Hui

Reports indicate that since last winter, smallpox has been rampant in Hong Kong, and it has also been seen in Shanghai. Those infected are mostly children, and the number of deaths is in the dozens. The health authorities are planning to compulsorily vaccinate over 3.3 million people within the year. This article will introduce and elaborate on vaccination.

The Origin of Vaccination

Smallpox is one of the most virulent and contagious infectious diseases. It is particularly prevalent in winter when we are more likely to be in close contact with each other. Because there is no prior immunity, both adults and children are highly susceptible, and children are more likely to be infected, leading to a higher mortality rate. This disease has been around for perhaps over two thousand years, with severe outbreaks and high mortality rates both in China and abroad. Experience has shown that if one has had a mild case, one can avoid a severe recurrence. This led to the accidental invention of inoculation methods. According to old Chinese methods, there were water seedlings (smallpox scabies dipped in cotton and inserted into the nose), dry seedlings (scab powder blown into the nose), smallpox clothing (having healthy children wear the inner clothing of children who had smallpox for two or three days), and having a wet nurse who had had smallpox breastfeed another infant. Although mild cases were selected for inoculation, severe transmission and intermediate contact transmission were still unavoidable, and widespread implementation was impossible. Therefore, the disease continued to occur sporadically or remain endemic.

Although we already know that the filtrate of smallpox originates in cows, which suffer from cowpox; and that inoculation of the adapted virus of cowpox into humans prevents smallpox, the relationship between the antibody precursors, serum, and morphology of the two pathogens is still not fully understood. However, the immune relationship between the two was observed as early as 1744. In Gloucestershire, England, milkmaids who came into contact with cows suffering from cowpox developed cowpox on their hands and did not contract smallpox during smallpox outbreaks. From 1768, Dr. Riwaril Jermer in that area made in-depth observations. Finally, in 1796, he inoculated pus from the hand of a milkmaid infected with cowpox into a healthy child. This child developed cowpox, and later, when inoculated with pus from a smallpox patient, did not become ill. This confirmed that cowpox could not only be transmitted from cows to humans and prevent smallpox, but also that pus from someone suffering from cowpox could be inoculated into another person to prevent smallpox. He published his findings in 1798. This discovery was the precursor to modern artificial immunization. Although there were initially skeptics, the facts were quickly accepted by the world. The pustules from cows were called cowpox, and inoculation of humans with cowpox pus was called vaccination. The fact that vaccination could prevent smallpox was universally recognized.

Since then, the method of cowpox vaccination has spread to other countries. It was introduced to China in 1805. All countries should be able to utilize this awareness and implement it effectively. The disease will be nearly eradicated in all areas (for example, in our country, in 1872, there were still 2,585 people who were blinded by it, and in 1904, more than 200 people died. Since 1924, due to free vaccination, there have been no cases). But in our country, because implementation is not effective, the method of scarring with pus has not been eradicated, and the disease is still seen every year. There is no way to count the instances of infection or death, which is truly regrettable.

Implementation by the Health Community

Since the value of vaccination is as described above, the government should implement it widely, and the people should accept it without question. However, how to implement it and what to pay attention to needs to be introduced. The following is a more detailed description:

(1) Age of Vaccination: Because infants are susceptible to infection and based on the recommendations of the military, infants should be vaccinated between four and six months of age. Premature and malnourished infants should be vaccinated later. Before entering school, and again during adolescence, everyone should be vaccinated once. Thereafter, anyone should be re-vaccinated during an epidemic to ensure safety.

(2) Season for Vaccination: Should be determined based on health conditions, climate, and the presence of any systemic infectious diseases or skin diseases. If it is summer and there is excessive sweating, itching, and many skin diseases, or if it is winter and there are many other infectious diseases that affect children's health, which may induce systemic or local complications due to vaccination, then early winter or mid-spring may be more appropriate. Diabetics are prone to skin infections and can also delay vaccination slightly. However, if there is a smallpox epidemic, these small concerns should be abandoned for the sake of overall safety.

(3) Location of Vaccination: Usually, the upper third of the outer side of the upper arm is chosen for boys. For girls, to avoid scarring, the upper third of the outer side of the thigh or the outer side of the middle third of the calf can be chosen. The general principle is to avoid areas that are exposed to sweat or excessive friction.

(4) Vaccination Method: First, use alcohol, ether, or acetone to clean the area to be vaccinated and wait for it to dry. Then, take refrigerated and unexpired vaccine and drip it onto the area. Then, use a sterilized needle to gently scratch one or two lines about one centimeter long, or use a needle to prick the area five or six times vertically, or hold the needle at an angle and scrape it over the area several times. The goal is to get the vaccine into the skin without causing bleeding. Wipe away the excess serum with clean cotton. Do not apply any additional dressings. Do not bathe or wash the area with soap within 24 hours. If pus develops in the area later, cover it with a sterilized dressing and change it daily. Do not remove the dressing after it adheres, and do not bathe until the scab falls off.

(5) Reactions: If the attached vaccine has not expired and the vaccination site has not been washed with strong disinfectants or water, there should be a reaction after vaccination. An early reaction indicates a lack of immunity. Reactions can be of several types: (1) If there is slight redness and itching in the area within one or two days, which soon subsides, it can be considered that there is current immunity. (2) If a red pustule one or two centimeters in size appears in the area within three to five days, with vesicles on top, and there is a fever, it can be considered that there is partial immunity. (3) If a larger area of redness and swelling appears after five days, with vesicles that gradually enlarge and become pustules, and there is fever, pain throughout the body, and swollen local lymph nodes, this is "eruption," which indicates that the person is actually susceptible to smallpox.

After successful vaccination, i.e., after eruption, immunity to smallpox develops within twelve days. Since the incubation period of smallpox is eight to twelve days, if proper vaccination is done immediately after exposure to smallpox and there is a good eruption, there is no risk of developing the disease. Even if vaccination is delayed until a few days before the onset of the disease, it can make the disease milder. If there is no reaction in the area after vaccination, instead of interpreting it as immunity, it should be considered that the vaccine is defective or the vaccination method is flawed, and revaccination should be done every two weeks until there is a reaction, because according to historical records, some people have erupted after being vaccinated thirteen times.

Occasionally, if the area becomes infected and develops an abscess or lymphadenitis after vaccination, it should be treated surgically. Or, if the vaccine is not completely wiped away or the pus from the area contaminates another area, causing self-inoculation, there will be no serious consequences. In very rare cases, serious neurological symptoms may occur due to vaccination, but this is extremely rare, and the risk is insignificant compared to the danger of contracting smallpox without vaccination.

Generally speaking, a single vaccination can provide immunity for about five years, and after contracting the disease once, one can have lifelong immunity, but recurrence is still occasionally seen. Therefore, we say that everyone should be vaccinated during a smallpox epidemic.

### One of the Worries of Northern Jiangsu: Kala-Azar

— Yin Suihe

The name kala-azar is somewhat unfamiliar to people near Shanghai, as it is a regional disease prevalent in northern Jiangsu and northern China. However, with the increasing convenience of transportation in recent years, the number of merchants coming and going from northern Jiangsu is also increasing. Therefore, patients with kala-azar are often seen in Shanghai, and our affiliated hospitals can often find a few. Whether this disease will spread here in the future is uncertain!

The signs of this disease can be partially understood from its name. Because more than half of the people suffering from this disease have slightly black skin, and combined with persistent and recurrent remittent fever, it is named kala-azar. The source of the disease is a type of sandfly that bites people and sucks blood, introducing a protozoan parasite called Leishmania donovani into the human body. After an incubation period of two to four months, it begins to manifest. The fever pattern is similar to typhoid fever. Sometimes there may be alternating chills and fever, similar to malaria. However, it has a characteristic feature, which is that the fever pattern within 24 hours may fluctuate high and low two or three times. After three or four weeks, the body temperature drops to normal. After two or three weeks, this fluctuating fever returns for several weeks. This happens three or four times, lasting for about a year and a half. One month after the onset of the disease, the spleen begins to swell. In six months, it can swell to near the navel. At the same time, the liver also has considerable swelling. The patient becomes increasingly thin and weak, often feeling headaches and dizziness, occasionally experiencing night sweats, and the skin gradually turns black. If left untreated, it will endanger life in two or three years, or as short as one or two years. In the past, before the development of effective treatments, eight or nine out of ten people who contracted this disease died. But now, with scientific advancement, there are effective treatments, and the mortality rate is only one or two out of ten.

In terms of diagnosis, in addition to the above-mentioned signs, there is also blood testing, and puncture examinations of the spleen, liver, and bone marrow can provide positive confirmation. In addition to anemia, a decrease in the total number of white blood cells and a decrease in the percentage of polymorphonuclear leukocytes are also characteristics of kala-azar. The increase in globulin and euglobulin is also unique to it. Of course, these cannot be considered conclusive evidence. If you can perform puncture examinations of the spleen, liver, and bone marrow, you will definitely be able to find those deeply sinful protozoa. These are single-celled, the most basic, lowest-level animals. But it is unknown how many of our fellow citizens in northern Jiangsu they kill each year.

In terms of treatment, in the past, it could be considered that doctors were helpless. Since the invention of drug treatment in 1914 (such as Neostieosan, Neostam-Urea, Stibamine, Solustibosan), eight or nine out of ten patients can be saved. This may be considered the recent good fortune of patients in the last thirty years. However, treatment is not as good as prevention. I hope that the local health administration authorities can pay more attention to prevention to eliminate the root causes. This will greatly benefit our fellow citizens in northern Jiangsu, as well as foreign residents.

### Talking About Measles

— Peng Da'en

Answering Many Questions About Children's Measles

Recently, measles has been prevalent, and it has not subsided from early winter to the present. Parents who have children who have not had measles must be worried day and night, wondering if their children will contract measles? What are some good ways to prevent it? If measles really breaks out, how should they be treated to recover quickly? This article provides a comprehensive answer to questions of this nature.

(1) Who Gets Measles?

According to statistical results, 95% of humans have had measles at some point in their lives, and 50% are children under the age of five. However, young infants from birth to six months are not easily infected with measles, because most mothers have already had measles, and their blood's immune antibodies against measles can be transferred to the fetus through the placenta. However, this passive immunity does not last long and gradually decreases after birth, disappearing almost completely by five or six months. The period from five or six months to school age is the most susceptible to infection. Understanding this, if there are measles cases in the family, infants under six months do not need to be isolated. The rest who have not had measles are at risk of being infected. Especially in Shanghai, where the population has increased dramatically after the war and housing is extremely crowded, this further promotes the spread of measles, causing it to become an epidemic.

(2) How Should Children Who Have Been in Contact with Measles Patients Be Treated?

Logically speaking, everyone will definitely have measles once in their lifetime, and after that, they can be immune for life, saving future troubles. Therefore, generally healthy children of slightly older age are left to their own devices during an epidemic. However, in certain situations, such as very young age (one or two years old), poor nutrition, and various chronic and acute diseases, such as pulmonary tuberculosis, whooping cough, etc., if measles is contracted in addition to these issues, it will add fuel to the fire. The small and weak body will definitely not be able to withstand it and will die young. Therefore, we should prevent these children from contracting measles. If it cannot be avoided, the symptoms must be alleviated. To achieve the above goals, we must use "passive immunization." Currently, there are several commonly used products available for intramuscular injection (see attached table).

The above-mentioned products each have their own advantages and disadvantages. Adult serum and placental globulin are more likely to cause reactions, but they are easier to purchase and obtain. Convalescent measles serum has almost no reactions, but most people are unwilling to have their measles-recovered children's blood drawn to protect others. Human serum globulin is widely used in the United States and has good results.

All of the above products must be injected within the first five or six days after infection (the first half of the incubation period), otherwise they cannot produce a protective effect. Furthermore, the immunity produced by the above methods is passive and can only last for up to eight weeks. If another measles patient is contacted three weeks later, reinfection can occur, and another injection should be administered. As for active immunization methods, after research by Lakka and Savir, there is hope for success soon.

(3) What are the Symptoms of Measles?

During a measles epidemic, whenever children who have not had measles develop cold symptoms, we must carefully observe and be vigilant about the occurrence of measles. Because the symptoms of measles in the first three or four days—the invasion period—are no different from ordinary upper respiratory tract inflammation. The patient begins to feel uncomfortable all over the body, with headache, fever, poor appetite, frequent sneezing, fear of light in the eyes, tearing, coughing, and hoarse crying. If the fever is too high in young infants, they may develop lethargy and convulsions. At this time, the diagnosis cannot be confirmed, but if there is a history of contact with someone who has measles, the possibility is very high. After 24-36 hours, the measles-specific Koplik's spots appear on the buccal mucosa of the child's cheek, near the molars. At this time, the doctor can confirm the diagnosis of measles.

The rash begins to appear on the third or fourth day of fever. It first appears at the hairline, behind the ears, and on the back of the neck, and then quickly spreads to the forehead, cheeks, and then the whole body. The rash is initially sparse, rose-red papules, which then increase, connect with each other, and the color becomes a little darker red. When the rash is at its peak, the fever rises to 104-105 degrees Fahrenheit, and the overall symptoms worsen. The rash subsides after three or four days, first in the areas where it appeared first, and fine, bran-like scales flake off. At this time, the fever gradually decreases, the child feels refreshed, and appetite gradually increases, until recovery, which takes three to four weeks.

(4) How to Take Care of a Child with Measles?

Shanghai lacks infectious disease hospitals, and ordinary pediatric wards cannot accommodate children with measles. Therefore, measles cases are often kept at home, and the doctor visits at most once a day. The rest of the care is entirely the responsibility of the mother or other family members.

(A) Room Equipment: Measles is a disease caused by a highly contagious virus. Therefore, the patient should be isolated from others. The fewer people coming and going in the room, the better, and everyone must wear a mask and wash their hands with disinfectant to reduce the chance of the child being infected with other bacteria.

The room should be simply furnished, with good air circulation and plenty of sunlight. But if the sunlight is too strong, a curtain can be hung to avoid direct sunlight. The indoor temperature should be below 70 degrees Fahrenheit, with suitable humidity. The child should absolutely rest in bed until fully recovered.

(B) Cleanliness First: I really don't understand the popular Chinese belief that "you can't wipe your face when you have measles." What is the basis for this? I really don't understand why parents do this so blindly, and they are not casual about it at all? So we often see children with measles who don't wipe their faces or wash their hands for days and nights, or even weeks, with their faces covered in eye discharge and nasal mucus. Does this really make the measles heal faster? No, definitely not. This only adds to the child's unnecessary suffering. On the contrary, during measles, because of inflammation of the respiratory tract, secretions from the eyes, ears, mouth, and nose increase, so you need to wash your face and rinse your mouth often to reduce bad breath and keep your face and mouth clean to avoid various eye and mouth inflammations, especially the dangerous gangrenous stomatitis. If you wait until the child's breath smells like feces, the cheeks break, and the teeth fall out, it will be too late to find a solution.

(C) Overthrow "Dietary Restrictions": Children with measles should drink more water, especially when the fever is very high and the appetite is poor. Easily digestible foods, especially milk and porridge, should still be provided as usual. Unless there is diarrhea, you can reduce the amount appropriately. When the fever decreases and the appetite increases, the diet should also increase accordingly. Eggs, broth, orange juice, and cod liver oil are especially important. Many ignorant parents often follow the instructions of quack doctors and strictly restrict the child's diet, giving the child nothing but some boiled water and fried rice soup, and some even prolong it for half a month or a month, even though the child has a good appetite. After a long time, the child's eyes can't open. If the treatment is too late, it can lead to blindness. This is xerophthalmia caused by vitamin A deficiency, which is rare in Europe and the United States, but is commonplace in measles cases in China. These are the consequences of "dietary restrictions." Even if the eyes are not affected, the child will only be a bag of bones after the measles is cured. If there is already tuberculosis, the tuberculosis bacteria will take the opportunity to become active and spread rapidly into miliary tuberculosis or tuberculous meningitis, leading to death. Other pyogenic bacteria, such as pneumococcus, hemolytic streptococcus, and staphylococcus, also get a good opportunity to produce various complications, such as laryngitis, otitis media, and bronchopneumonia, which can cause the patient to lose their life. Among them, bronchopneumonia is the greatest.

(D) Medicine Can Only Help a Little: Although there is still no specific medicine for measles, if the patient is healthy and well-cared for, without complications, they often recover on their own without sequelae. The use of medicine is only for symptomatic treatment. For example, if the skin is too itchy, you can apply diluted sodium bicarbonate water. If the fever is too high or there are neurological symptoms, you can use antipyretics and sedatives. If the cough is severe, use cough suppressants. If the throat is inflamed, use steam inhalation, etc. Sulfonamide chemicals, such as sulfathiazole or sulfapyridine (dia-clean), can be given in advance to prevent infections caused by streptococcus and pneumococcus. But these drugs must be taken under the guidance of a doctor. Parents should not be smart and use them arbitrarily.

### Starting from "Youth Psychological Cultivation"

— Youxian

Mr. Ding Zan, the author of "Youth Psychological Cultivation," is one of the leading experts in psychological therapy in China, so I need not introduce him further. The material in this book is entirely based on his years of experience and insights gained from personally listening to the heart-wrenching complaints of young people at psychological clinics. Now, he has published these experiences and insights in simple and vivid language. He is telling us about the trials and tribulations that Chinese youth are encountering. These touching stories frankly point out that Chinese families, schools, society, and even the entire nation, are facing an extremely serious problem – the imbalance of interpersonal relationships! In fact, this not only causes suffering for young people but also leads to the decline of society as a whole, political corruption, factional disputes, and even the spread of civil war, all stemming from the failure to reasonably resolve the "imbalance of interpersonal relationships." It can provoke international disputes and disrupt world peace. Humanity cannot ignore this problem! The day of success may seem distant, but a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step, and climbing high begins from below. "Taking the first step" is essential!

Parents in the home and teachers in schools are, of course, directly responsible for the upbringing of children. However, the popularization of new knowledge and the removal of old habits are obviously difficult and require considerable time. Besides a few enlightened leaders in the cultural world, the most powerful promoters in the future should still be doctors.

Speaking of doctors, it makes one shudder! A careful perusal of the "Medical Q&A" and "Social Services" sections of various newspapers and magazines reveals that seven or eight out of ten people who write in with questions about their illnesses are suffering from the friction of morbid psychology. It is pitiful that these narrow-minded doctors, who are inherently deficient and have suffered maladjustment, are unable to provide correct answers. Is "masturbation" really the main cause of "impotence" and "premature ejaculation"? Experts in psychoanalysis tell us that masturbation itself is not the problem; it is the fantasies that accompany it that are harmful to mental health. The object of these fantasies may be incestuous. The contradictions or sense of guilt in these abnormal fantasies, even the fear of masturbation, or the regret caused by being unable to quit masturbation, are the main causes of impotence. Sexual dysfunction is a common manifestation of many psychological illnesses. The real trauma lies within the soul.

"Neurasthenia" has become a very common diagnosis. But are the nerves of these patients really weak? Many are actually exhibiting signs of nervous hyper-sensitivity. They exaggerate their ailments excessively or find it difficult to tolerate minor discomfort. Their sympathetic nervous systems are affecting the function of their volitional nervous systems. In the subconscious depths of these patients' hearts, emotions that cannot be expressed are suppressed. That is the root of the illness. These unfortunate patients travel to hospitals and clinics of all sizes, spending countless amounts of money in vain, and chewing all kinds of secret remedies advertised, but the illness refuses to let them go. Finally, they turn to "medical advisors" and "social services" for help. See how earnestly and humbly they plead for help! They say, "I am a loyal reader of your newspaper. Since your newspaper added the Social Services section, the answers to various illnesses and treatments have been very detailed, benefiting people greatly and are worthy of admiration." How eagerly they await rescue! But in the end, the answers they receive are either "you must come to the clinic for an examination," or "take more tonics and strengthening agents," "long-term cold water baths," "cold water washing of the lower body," "continuous injections of 'Ciba-Geigy's Coramine' can be effective." Little do they know that they have already tried these wonderful prescriptions and remedies. Not one of the "great doctors" can point them to a clear path. Doctors are too neglectful of the psychological trauma of patients!

Not long ago, the author was talking to a young doctor about the problem of "neurasthenia," and he blurted out, "Ah! There are so many of them. I see two or three every day. It's really annoying, there's nothing I can do!" These doctors, fresh out of medical school, seem not to have studied psychiatry, and seem unaware of the existence of "psychoanalysis." The neglect of medical psychology in medical schools is evident.

According to experts, one-third of patients are suffering from psychological illnesses. Another one-third also have their physical pain aggravated by psychological problems. Therefore, it can be said that seven out of ten patients are suffering from the torment of psychological illnesses. It seems that most doctors are products of "anatomy," "pathology," "injections," and "surgery." They often forget that the patient lying in bed is a human being with emotions. Some medical educators have noticed the relationship between doctors and patients, but the association between emotional states and disease has received very little attention in China. In the United States, in the past decade, "psychosomatic medicine" has made rapid progress and has already laid a solid foundation. In order to catch up, our medical colleagues should no longer cling to old ways and seek answers to diseases solely within pathology. It is not easy to become an expert in psychoanalysis. However, having assumed the responsibility of diagnosing and treating sick "people," one must have considerable common sense about the emotions of these "people." Today's general practitioners should calmly ask themselves, "What is the difference between me and a veterinarian?"

Professor Edward Weiss of the Department of Internal Medicine at Temple University Medical School in the preface to his book "Psychosomatic Medicine" mentions that twenty years ago, when he left the field of pathology and entered the clinic, he encountered a young female patient suffering from headaches of unknown origin. Using his pathological knowledge and scientific spirit, he conducted all sorts of examinations and experiments, but could not find the cause of the headache. During the course of this research, he performed a lumbar puncture. After this simple procedure, the condition worsened. In addition to severe neck pain, she also developed lower back pain and gastrointestinal symptoms. The patient was bedridden for about nine months. During this period, countless examinations and experiments were performed, but the results were all negative. Finally, the patient's family could no longer bear it and decided to consult another old doctor. This old doctor was their family physician and had cared for the patient since childhood. He knew the point that the young scientist had overlooked. It turned out that the patient's brother, who was also the head of the family, had a girlfriend. The two were likely to get married. The sister did not approve of their marriage but could not oppose it. Her illness was a childish expression of resistance to this marriage. Once the cause was explained, she naturally recovered. This valuable lesson taught the young doctor that merely learning pathological knowledge is not enough to become a doctor. It prompted him to work hard to replenish his knowledge and re-educate himself.

Every day in clinical practice, we encounter many patients with unexplained ailments. Doctors either see them as fat sheep who have come to the door to be slaughtered at will or treat them as pathological specimens, focusing solely on research. They neglect that these beings have emotional problems. The "people" who are facing us with worried faces and complaining of various pains have emotions. Psychological trauma is tormenting two-thirds of the patients. Medicine is constantly being reformed. Doctors need to replenish their knowledge and re-educate themselves. Ask yourself: "Am I a veterinarian?"

Spring and Autumn

### Beside the Water Mill

— Bao Yu

All around, are mountains, like screens. A stream flows down from the mountains, flowing very rapidly, making a gurgling sound.

There are no trees on the mountains; the withered yellow weeds grow like manes. Large stones show various strange shapes, scattered on the mountain peaks and at the foot of the mountains. In the mountain hollows, the light is very dim, and it is not easy to see the sunlight. In many deep places, the snow is still very thick.

Wild birds peck at the moss on the mountainside, occasionally uttering one or two cries. Their claws scratch the remaining snow, causing it to fall in a flurry.

The stream is very clear, and you can see many yellow stones at the bottom. The flowing water constantly impacts the stones, and their edges are polished smooth. Small fish dart and swim through the cracks between the rocks.

Beside the water, there is a small stone house. Its walls are made of large stones, and thin stone slabs serve as bricks and tiles. Two doors, front and back, are tightly closed, and weak light seeps in through the cracks in the stone.

On the side of the back door, there is a large wooden gear, a small part of which is immersed in the water. Inside the house, there are four stone mortars arranged. Horizontal beams and wooden wheels are connected tightly. The mortar body is made of wood, and one end is made of stone. In front of them, there are four stone troughs, the trough bodies are in the ground. The rapid current pushes the wooden wheels to rotate, thus connecting the mortars, which pound the rice grains inside in a rhythmic and orderly manner, like horses taking food from a trough.

This "water mill" was built jointly by several mountain villages nearby. They need it to constantly pound rice grains, especially during the winter months when almost every household needs to grind rice flour to make dumplings. Therefore, this mill does not stop day or night.

Xiao-e's mother also sits by the mortar day and night, sifting the flour. This flour is not her own; she is sifting it for others. She is like a tool for sifting rice flour.

In the year Xiao-e was born, Xiao-e's father was drafted by the Baojia chief, trained for a period, and sent to the front lines. From then on, he went farther and farther away, and needless to say, he never returned. After the victory, she received a letter from him saying that he would be home soon, but in fact, he still did not come back.

In these few years, she has been helping others with odd jobs to maintain the lives of herself and Xiao-e. Every winter, people rush back to celebrate the New Year, and every family pounds rice flour to prepare dumplings to eat. She has no rice flour to pound, she just helps others sift flour – filling one dou of flour, obtaining a small reward.

The light coming in from the small holes shines on Xiao-e's mother's dry, sallow face. Seeing her face, you would never believe she is only around thirty years old. She is wearing a pink cotton-padded jacket. This is her wedding dress, which she has been wearing for nine years. There are many holes in the jacket, and the yellow-black cotton protrudes from the holes, like wide-open, unfocused eyes.

She sits on the ground with a large bamboo sieve in front of her and a scoop in her hand. She scoops the crude, coarse flour into the scoop, and her hands shake and pat, letting the fine flour fall through the sieve holes into the bottom.

She has been sifting like this non-stop for three days and three nights. Her legs have long lost feeling, and her arms ache as if they have been sawn off. But she is still sifting, sifting. The rising flour gently climbs onto her hair, climbs onto her eyebrows… Her eyebrows and hair have turned white.

"How many dumplings are you preparing to make this year?"

"My family will make more than a dozen baskets, what about yours?"

"About the same. What kinds of fillings do you have?"

"We have shredded pork, date paste…"

"We have lard and white sugar…"

Xiao-e's mother listened to the conversations of the women next to her about dumplings, feeling a cold despair in her heart.

The wooden wheel is turning, making creaking sounds, as if lamenting, sighing.

Xiao-e jumped in from the door. The child, eight or nine years old, is quite tall, wearing an old blue cotton-padded robe with a very short hem.

"Mom, someone made a boat!" Xiao-e shouted excitedly.

His mother stared at him for a moment. She saw his flat face, flat nose, and thick lips, which were exactly like his father's.

"Mom, come and see!"

"What boat?"

"The boat I made with the wooden basin. I want to sit on it and go find Daddy to come back and eat dumplings! Mom, how many dumplings are we making?"

"Many, many!" Xiao-e's mother answered vaguely.

"I want to eat a hundred, two hundred, Daddy will eat even more! I want to sit on the boat and go find him!"

"Your father is on the other side of the river, far away from here, how can you get there?" Xiao-e became more and more excited.

"Why can't I? Doesn't the water behind us lead to the river? I can just sit on the boat, cross the river, and find him!"

"You don't even recognize your father?" – Two tears rolled down her cheeks and into the rice flour sieve, turning into two rolling flour beads.

"Didn't you say that Daddy's face is just like mine?"

"Your father has a wife and children on the other side of the river, he doesn't want you!" She said deliberately.

"No, it's not peaceful on the other side of the river, he can't come, and you can't go!" Mom couldn't bear the child to cry out loud, and hurriedly changed her words.

…………

Late at night, the water mill has stopped running. Xiao-e's mother, unable to resist fatigue, fell asleep on a pile of straw in the corner, taking a rest.

She saw her husband come back. His clothes were wet.

"How did you come back?" she asked.

"I came back on a small boat!" her husband replied.

She smiled and woke up. The child sleeping beside her was snoring, and the sound of the flowing water outside was still gurgling.

### Congratulations to Mr. Li Shizeng

— Zhang Yiqu

### New Research on Hardy

— Zhao Jingshen

Recently, two books about the British writer Thomas Hardy have been published in the United States, proving that Hardy's works are enduring and that readers still pay great attention to him. Both of these books discuss Hardy's novels. Lord Robert Cecil's "Hardy the Novelist" has already defined its scope. Carl J. Weber's "Hardy in America" also focuses on his prose and does not pay much attention to his poetry.

Some may say that this is biased and incomplete, but Hardy himself shared this opinion, as he despised his own novels and short stories. In 1916, when Harold Child was preparing to write a study of Hardy, he suggested to Child: "Please treat my poem (Dynasts) as my main work, and my novel as my accidental work. The opposite approach is much better. In fact, I write novels only passively, forced to write. Some sharp-eyed critics are also slowly paying attention to my poetry."

How was Hardy forced to write novels? At the age of twenty-seven, he wanted to devote himself to creative writing, feeling that an architect's office could not give him more opportunities. In London, he read Swinburne and Shelley and learned to write some poems himself, but after printing them, no one appreciated them. So, for money, he wrote novels and submitted them to companies such as Macmillan, but they returned his manuscripts, telling him that the trend in novels required complex plots. So, in order to become a novelist, Hardy carefully studied the popular novels of the time, especially those of Wilkie Collins. His sure dramatic sense, his understanding of atmosphere and layout, and his tight structure made his novels extraordinary, and his early works quickly gained a large readership.

Eventually, he was recognized by Leslie Stephen, the editor of "Cornhill," and his novels were published serially in this magazine, one after another, and his income and reputation gradually increased. Except for "Tess" and "Jude," it can be said that Hardy's novels were all written for money. The American "Harper's" magazine published a British edition, and Hardy's novels supported the scene. At that time, Hardy was seriously ill, struggling on the line of death, and still worked hard to write a long introduction for it. This event is also recorded in Weber's book.

One advantage of Tansel's work is that he does not devote much space to Hardy's philosophy and the sources of his works. He also talks about the situation of Hardy studies in American universities, which is surprising. In the past seventy-five years, only one professor in England has mentioned Hardy's works, but in the past forty years, there have already been at least one hundred and twenty-five papers on Hardy in the United States. Unfortunately, these papers mostly focus on Hardy's philosophy and the sources of his works. In fact, Hardy is not a philosopher, he is an artist who develops his views from his personal life experiences. Indeed, he read Schopenhauer and Hartmann in 1880, and twenty-five years earlier he had read the tragedies of Aeschylus and Sophocles, which gave his works a sentimental element, but this did not change his basic views.

Weber has been studying Hardy for many years, and he is very suitable to write "Hardy in America." He describes in detail Hardy's relationship with American publishers, the praise of him by American literary critics, his popularity among American readers, and the enthusiasm of American universities for studying Hardy, all of which are recorded in detail and are very convenient to consult.

### Peasant Figure

— Watteau

Watteau (Watteau) was a talented painter born in 1684 in a small village near the Belgian border, Valenciennes. He became famous at the age of nineteen and was extremely active in the Paris art scene. He was a key figure in the so-called Rococo movement. His early works were influenced by Rubens, and the atmosphere of his works was more serious. His later works, because he was good at dealing with nobles and lived in a high-class environment, reflected luxury, splendor, leisure, and freedom in his works, becoming genre paintings of the time. "Peasant Figure" is a product of the transition from the early to the later period and is a representative work of his fame. The work is now in the Louvre. (Lion)

### Random Talk about Couplets

— Zhan Weng

When Weng Songchan was dying, he wrote a couplet for himself: "If I hear the Tao in the morning, I can die in the evening. From now on, I know I should strive to go!" He asked Zhang Zhidong to write it. Zhidong was Songchan's favorite student. When Weng passed away, he also offered a eulogy couplet: "What can the public do? You could have been Zhu Daxing, but you were not even as good as Li Wenzheng. It is not enough to tell! Why has there been a party to pass down? Perhaps you are expected to be a wild person. Zhu Daxing's name was 筠, Li Wenzheng, Li Hongzao, and Weng were all imperial teachers. In terms of learning, Weng was better than Li, and Weng was Wen Gong and also died earlier than Li. Therefore, Zhidong was calling out to his teacher.

When Sun Jiazao's home was in ruins, a student named Wang wrote a eulogy couplet: "This is true reason, without the name of reason, pitiful is a generation of upright officials, sailing across the East Sea. Only the ancient ministers, the friends of the ministers, recalling the twenty years of sincere people, always accompanied Yushan." The East Sea refers to Xu Tongxuan, and Yushan refers to Weng Songhong. Weng hated Jiazao, so he was sarcastic about his strength.

### An Inch of Mountains and Rivers, An Inch of Blood 171

— Ye Jingfeng

Behind him was the little tiger, with the body of a child and the size of an adult. Because he was half a head taller, he seemed a little afraid that we would see him, so he lowered his head slightly, but from behind Yao Xuan's flowing hair, half a pair of eyes were revealed, blinking for a moment. The third person, standing behind the two people, stood towering, taller than the two by almost half a body, thick and strong, standing straight, somewhat like a pagoda. That was "04," named Shen Youwen; according to him, he was still a branch of the Korean royalty. Looking at his tall cheekbones and strong jaw, I knew it was not easy for him to open his mouth. No wonder he spoke so stutteringly, one word every half day, making people anxious for him.

"Mr. Gu, Mr. Yue, are you two going out? … We came at an awkward time, didn't we?" Yao Xuan's voice was so crisp and sweet, yet rich in charm, unlike the delicate and thin voices of girls; she and Ping Pingzi, one came from the Jing dialect of Japan, and the other was a native of the Northeast sorghum land. Asking two questions, both were interrogative, a typical Northeast accent.

"It's nothing, it's nothing." Gu Jian saw Yao Xuan and also picked up some Northeast accent, "Because I have some free time, I thought of going to Xiehe Hospital to visit Engineer Wu. Please come in and sit down, it's still early anyway."

Yao Xuan hesitated slightly, then turned around, took the little tiger, and stepped into the house together, "Today is Saturday. The hospital is usually open from two to four o'clock, I just came back with my little brother."

"That's right," I hurriedly replied; because just as He Jian and the guests were entering the door, I heard Ping Pingzi's words, and she rolled her eyes at me, meaning I had messed up the hospital's opening hours. "Yes, Xiehe's rules are that Monday to Friday it's 5 p.m.; I didn't expect today to be Saturday, I was almost confused by these two days of big events."

"Is there anything wrong?" He Jian saw that "04" was still standing outside the door, neither advancing nor retreating.

"It's nothing, the doorbell rang just now. …" "04" paused on each word.

"Oh, it's cancelled—originally it was an important matter, now I'm not going out," I explained to "04" on behalf of He Jian.

"Good fellow," He Jian looked at the little tiger as he entered the house, grabbed one of his hands, and examined it repeatedly, sighing like this, "It's even more powerful than an iron fork, sliding in, it can even insert into someone's stomach, … the Japanese wouldn't believe it; they would definitely say it's a myth. … I really want to see you do it sometime to open my eyes!" He Jian's face was full of envy.

"I didn't believe it much until I saw it myself," I thought of that night, when the little tiger took down that Japanese deputy captain and the car driver.

"There are people who are even more powerful than Tiger Brother," Yao Xuan giggled, "There are several people in Tiger Brother's association who can do this, it's not unusual. … The year before last, an old man came to the association, he was so skinny that he looked unlike himself, but his fingers could even poke a hole in a hard rock, it's really unbelievable."

"Ah, the world is so big, there is really no end to wonders!" Gu Jian sighed with some emotion, "Not believing is also 'a summer insect cannot speak of ice' … oh, I remember, Yue Ping Mentioned earlier that Tiger Brother can disarm a gun with his bare hands, what kind of skill is that… come, try it and show me, I want to learn this trick…" Gu Jian said, immediately pulling the little tiger to the middle of the room, a four- or five-foot square open space.

### Post-War Germany: Feminine Ascendancy and Masculine Decline - Seeking Husbands Everywhere

— Translated by the Reuters Duferth Correspondent for this Newspaper's Translation Department

"Marriage is my greatest wish for 1947. I am an attractive young woman, 38 years old. My hobbies are art, music, theater, and movies... I now need a 40-year-old man to hold me in his strong arms, but his height cannot exceed five feet five inches."

In Frankfurt, Germany, love is being mediated through advertisements.

This city is the location of the American occupation forces. On the notice boards at street corners, brightly colored advertisements are posted. Besides advertisements for rentals and employment, there are also advertisements seeking husbands and wives. In Germany, indeed, there are more women than men; the ratio of female to male is six to one. Therefore, there are many seeking husbands, but very few seeking wives. Their conditions focus on the financial status of the other party and their relationship with the Nazis.

A Heart, a Pair of Rings

A small, pink advertisement. On it are drawn two concentric hearts intertwined with wedding rings. The content is as follows: "Marriage is my greatest wish for 1947. I am an attractive young woman, 38 years old. My hobbies are art, music, theater, and movies. I have a lot of money, and also a passionate heart. I now need a 40-year-old man to hold me in his strong arms, but his height cannot exceed five feet five inches."

No Nazis Need Apply

Another more practical woman wrote a short and to-the-point article: "I am not a beauty queen, but I have a hotel and a very well-equipped home. Is there anyone willing to be my business partner and husband there? No Nazis need apply, and those under forty years of age should not try!"

In addition to newspaper-style advertisements, marriage agencies are also advertising extensively. A recent advertisement said: "Do you want to be a lucky wife? We can introduce you to the following: (1) Landowner, 48 years old, (2) Textile merchant, 36 years old, (3) Grocery store owner, 48 years old. Photos available. Please come and see."

Matchmakers do not like marriages to take place in autumn and winter because housing and food are scarce. How can one honeymoon in hunger and cold? In the bright spring weather, although supplies are still lacking, a warm heart will eventually overcome the cold head. (7)

### Lingzhi Mushroom

— Gao Minggui

The other day, Zhejiang University held a Lingzhi mushroom charity exhibition on the second floor of the YMCA at Eight Immortals Bridge. This Lingzhi mushroom was discovered by Professor Qi Guangyu of Zhejiang University near Lover's Bridge on Qinwang Mountain in Hangzhou and transplanted into a crumbling tile pot. The outside of the pot was wrapped with white silk and placed in a glass box. The price was set at 50 million yuan, and it has not yet been purchased. According to reports: "From a distance, the Lingzhi mushroom is no different from ordinary mushrooms, but upon closer inspection, it is different. Its cap is not fully formed, missing about a quarter of the circle. The stem grows on one side and is about three inches long. It has a luster like ancient bronze and no patterns. The stem has cloud patterns, and its color is rusty, like bronze artifacts unearthed from the Shang Dynasty. The bottom of the cap is a layer of iridescent colors, as if it has been growing for a very long time."

The school's "Initiation" contains research on Lingzhi, saying: "芝 (zhi), 木作之 (mu zuo zhi), pictogram depicting the shape of grass growing. 雜說 (Za Shuo) says: '芝 (zhi) is grass, it sprouts three times a year.' Wang Chong's Lunheng says: '芝 (zhi) grows in fertile soil, where the soil's energy is harmonious, hence auspicious Lingzhi grass grows.' Lingzhi's shape and texture are very different; it is fragrant and glossy, without hair. Lingzhi has a stalk and its back has light. Its texture is soft, while Lingzhi is firm and uniquely outstanding..."

According to the author, Lingzhi is also a type of fungus. The difference is that other fungi are parasitic on other plants, while Lingzhi grows independently. Lingzhi does not have much value in biology. Its preciousness lies only in the difficulty of finding it, and that it is rare. According to legend, Lingzhi receives the essence of the sun and moon, and spiritual energy every day. It grows in remote mountains and has been around for a long time. It can bear fruit, shaped like a baby, called "He Shou Wu". Lingzhi that is over a thousand years old can transform into human, horse, and other shapes, producing inspiration, and can move away from its original plant. People who cultivate the Tao, if they eat it, can "increase five hundred years of Taoist practice" and "quickly achieve enlightenment". Ordinary people who eat it can also preserve their longevity and achieve immortality. Emperor Qin Shihuang ordered Xu Fu to go to the "Penglai Immortal Island" in Dongying (Japan) to search for the elixir of immortality, which was this thing. Xu Fu, knowing that he would be killed by the First Emperor if he failed his mission, lived out his days in a foreign land. We often see this kind of bizarre and strange legend in mythical novels.

These kinds of legends are probably just like the stories of Qi Dongye and are not reliable. Otherwise, 50 million yuan would not be expensive. There are many wealthy people in Shanghai who have countless fortunes and are desperate to find a way to avoid death, and they would definitely flock to it and snap it up. Moreover, what Zhejiang University obtained was only a Lingzhi mushroom, not an "He Shou Wu" or "Lingzhi fruit" that had become a spirit. No wonder the price of 50 million yuan is still "unattended".

Tragically, the poor students waiting for relief have had very poor results from this exhibition. The number of charity sales and purchases is also very small, and many people must be very disappointed. Shanghai's wealthy are not interested in academic exhibitions. To hold a charity event, one must trot out women to rally support in order to get them to "generously donate" and "return satisfied", saying, "This money was well spent." The organizers will definitely achieve remarkable results, and both parties will be "delighted" and achieve a satisfactory result. With people's hearts like this, what is the use of fairness!

I think that the authorities at Zhejiang University set the price of the Lingzhi mushroom a bit too high. The wealthy are unwilling to spend 50 million yuan to buy a weed and take it back to study, and scholars of biology cannot afford such a high price, disappointing the auspicious Lingzhi and countless poor students waiting for scholarships, and they have to "return disappointed".

### Ode to Sending Off Candidates

— Forget Myself

This place is:

"Few quotas, many applicants,"

That place is:

"No such rank"—

Look at those

Greeting and sending off with joy

How many people

Sigh and lament!

Who doesn't have children to study?

Where does luck rely on connections?

Connections, connections,

Connections are nothing more than power and profit

### New Defenses Between Men and Women

— Kui Yuan

After reading "The Nanjing Massacre"

People of a certain age may still remember that in small cities, theaters and bookstores used to clearly indicate "Male Seating" and "Female Seating" with red paper to show "civilization," and such decorations were also often included in "civilized wedding" ceremonies. The situation was much the same in Shanghai, the "Ten-Mile Foreign Concession." Ladies and grandmothers of wealthy families would, as a rule, sit in the box seats when going to the theater. As for men and women sitting together indiscriminately on streetcars, it was denounced by moralists as uncouth, or, to put it another way, as being quite vulgar. This is because we have always emphasized the strict separation of men and women, although the blame always falls on women. However, in terms of "Male Seating" and "Female Seating," it seems quite fair to divide them into two camps to avoid "improper contact between the sexes," and to have them each guard their territory.

Ethics aside, "Male Seating" and "Female Seating" only exist in public places. Outside of these places, anything goes. Therefore, this method is not necessarily perfect. However, I had previously wondered what this so-called "strict separation" was all about, until I discovered the boundaries and finally understood: "So that's how it is."

Unfortunately, this system of boundaries has declined considerably over the years. I don't think it exists in Shanghai anymore. Forgive my ignorance, but I don't know what it's like in the countryside or inland areas. This is truly quite dangerous.

Someone once advocated for dividing swimming pools in Shanghai with wooden boards to separate men and women. These boards would, of course, be a defense line. However, the world is not a swimming pool, so how can we put up wooden boards everywhere? As a result, it seems that swimming pools still don't have wooden boards. Although those who worry about the world are well-intentioned, it is difficult to reverse deeply ingrained habits. Seeing the situation today, much effort has already been wasted.

There is also another layer: does this so-called "strict separation" mean that men should guard against women? Or that women should guard against men? Or that both sides should guard against each other? This is also an issue that has been neglected in research over the years.

A Joke

I remember a joke: A strange man and woman were traveling together and stayed at the same inn for the night, but there was only one room with a single bed. The man said, "Let's just sleep in the same bed." The woman said, "How can we do that!" The man said, "It's okay, we'll each sleep under a quilt." After they fell asleep, the man suddenly crossed the line. The woman said, "Didn't you say we would be separated by a quilt?" The man said, "It's okay, we're still separated by clothes."

From this, we can see that the issue of defense is truly too subtle and too difficult to research. However, at this point, if we are talking about strict separation, then women need to be strictly defensive. Considering China's national conditions, the responsibility lies with women, which reminds me of the chastity belts displayed in the Musée de Cluny in Paris. Its opening and closing mechanism is like the shorts worn by strongmen when they show off their skills, except that these are made of metal. To put it more plainly, it is a metal chastity belt that extends all the way to the buttocks, with two holes opened in the front, each with serrated edges. This is a famous artifact from the European Middle Ages. If a patriotic friend encounters Europeans making fun of our bound feet or something else, they can hold up this kind of thing and point it at their noses as revenge.

The advantage of this thing, it is said, is that it is not like ordinary pants, but is locked at the abdomen. This metal contraption is certainly very strong, but the key cannot be held by the woman, otherwise she would be suspected of colluding with the enemy. Once the contraption is still secure, but the defense line has already been lost, as with the principle of "fire prevention," it is truly very unsettling.

If industrialists can design something similar, it would probably not be difficult to design something comparable to this chastity belt, specifically for men. And if all the keys were handed over to people who are respected in society and who have always shaken their heads and sighed, or even if a nationwide committee were elected using China's new methods to take control, then the issue of strict separation between men and women would be solved very practically. If they were to do it even more actively, they could ask this committee to offer a reward to solicit an invention, just like the people of Northeast China in the puppet Manchukuo era had to wear "Concord Uniforms," and put all men and women in an invention—let's call it "Strict Separation Uniform." This uniform would be made of metal or some other material, with steel thorns hidden inside, and perhaps have a magnetic property, so that if a man wearing it touched a woman, the magnetic property would cause steel thorns to emerge all over his body; the same would happen to a woman who touched a man. And the clothes would be locked with a lock, with the keys managed by the committee or someone else. With such double protection, whether it is men guarding against women, women guarding against men, or both sides guarding against each other, it would no longer be an issue.

In today's world of rampant materialism, I cannot avoid being a materialist. As for promoting morals, I always feel it is somewhat subtle and intangible. If we say that men and women should be strictly separated, I think this materialist approach may not be meaningless.

A Matter of Ethics

Reading the Shen Bao of the 26th month, there was a Central News Agency dispatch from Nanjing saying that a "shocking massacre" occurred during the Lunar New Year. If the massacre is great and shocking, how does it compare to the massacres on the battlefield? So I had to continue reading. "...Li was young and lecherous, and had long had improper thoughts about his aunt, who was alone in an empty house. At about 10 p.m. on the night of the incident, Li You was in another room, and Li took the opportunity to enter the deceased's bedroom, intending to rape her. He was rejected by Zhang, and became angry and resentful. He took a kitchen knife and severely injured Zhang. People in the outer room heard the noise and rushed over, and Li was still standing there blankly. He was arrested by the police. After three days of interrogation, he confessed to the crime of attempted rape and murder." And Zhang had already "died of her injuries that night after the incident." "The Central Daily News specifically published an editorial today calling for 'establishing new defenses between men and women' to correct social ethics." It can also be seen that "defenses between men and women"

I don't know how old this Mr. Li Yanchang is this year. I think his life is probably over. He swung his knife at his aunt, and now others will swing their knives at him. This time it's about ethics, and it's not necessarily the woman's fault. Alas, defenses between men and women. What to do? Still morality?

### Foreign Lucky Child, the Second "Wang Didi"

— Feng

The only survivor on the Shen Hang No. 145 passenger plane that crashed in western Hubei was a sixteen-month-old baby, Paul Wick, the child of an American missionary. After China Airlines transported him back to Shanghai by special plane, he was sent to Hong En Hospital for treatment. This news caused a sensation in the Shanghai press, and many reporters went to Hong En Hospital to take photos of Paul. In the end, they all met with closed doors. But finally, An Lisen, a Shanghai-based photojournalist for the New York Times, took the only photo.

In Shanghai, Paul Wick was taken care of by the American United Church office. After recovering, he was sent back to the United States for upbringing according to his grandparents' wishes.

Little Paul and another Wang Didi both survived a great disaster. Their future achievements are quite interesting.

### Differences Between Men and Women

— Renewal

A woman strikes a match outwards, while a man strikes it towards himself. When a woman examines her fingernails, she opens her palm to look at the whole hand, while a man bends his fingers to look specifically at the nails. A woman looks around the room first, then focuses on a particular corner, while a man looks directly at that corner. When a woman drinks water, she always looks at the person standing opposite her, while a man looks at the water in his glass.

Here and Now

### Crossing the Border, Intercourse.

— Zu Ming

As soon as prices reach the "border," they "exit the border," and then "knock on the border"; how hurried!

The lives of ordinary people are passing through a "difficult pass," called "crossing the border"; it is a matter of "intercourse" with life!

Tuition is high, "talking about books is high."

Schools are about to open, and tuition is as high as hundreds of thousands, is it really "all professions are lowly, only studying is high"?
