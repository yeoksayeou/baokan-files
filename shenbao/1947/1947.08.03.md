### Discussion of Peace Treaty Issues with Japan: We Have Expressed Our Position to the US and Made Specific Suggestions Regarding Voting Procedures

[Central News Agency, Washington, 1st] A State Department spokesman announced today that China has responded to the US proposal to "convene a phased consultative conference on a peace treaty with Japan," but the spokesman did not specify when the reply was delivered. He stated that Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Shijie had discussed the matter with US Ambassador to China, Stuart Leavenworth, and Chinese Ambassador to the US, Gu Weijun, had also studied the matter with US State Department officials. Reporters then inquired about the detailed contents of China's reply. The spokesman responded that China's attitude was well known and refused to elaborate. He continued, "Unfortunately, the reporters and I all have the impression that 'China will make a formal reply on the issue of a peace treaty with Japan.'" He stated that the State Department did not anticipate receiving a formal reply from China, or one more formal than what it had received. When asked why China's reply was informal, he replied that he believed the State Department had never made a formal proposal. The US proposal to convene the conference was discussed informally with the Chinese Ambassador to the US when the latter was at the State Department, just as the Assistant Secretary of State for Occupied Areas Administration, Hilldreth, had spoken to other countries about the possibility of convening such a conference. The spokesman also announced that replies had been received from all ten invited countries.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 1st, United Press] US officials stated that the Chinese government, in its "informal" protest against the US proposal regarding voting procedures for the peace treaty with Japan, cited the US argument made when the eleven-nation Far Eastern Commission was established. At that time, the US sought to have resolutions of the Far Eastern Commission passed by a two-thirds majority of the eleven nations, but with the additional provision that the resolution must also be approved by a majority of the four major powers on the Allied Council for Japan in Tokyo. This meant that the consent of three of the four major powers (China, the US, the UK, and the Soviet Union) was required for a resolution to be finally adopted. The US originally intended this as a way to eliminate the veto power of a single nation, but the US and other countries eventually yielded to the Soviet Union's insistence that a simple veto by any one of the major powers could nullify any resolution. When the US proposed the voting procedure for the peace conference with Japan, it stated that a resolution would become final with a two-thirds majority vote of the eleven nations, with no distinction between major and minor powers in voting. However, China's comments on the voting method were only "informal." The Chinese Embassy in the US has not submitted these views to the US State Department to make them official. Some sources suggest that China intends to gauge the opinions of US officials on this issue.

### Mr. Gui Yongqing's Broadcast: The Current Status of Our Navy

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 2nd] Acting Commander-in-Chief of the Navy, General Gui Yongqing, broadcast to the nation from the Broadcasting Headquarters of the First Military Corps of the Ministry of National Defense at 7 p.m. on the 1st, on the topic of "The Current Status of the Chinese Navy." Gui first pointed out that the navy is an integral part of the national defense system, and then cited the Pacific naval battles during the recent World War to prove that a strong Chinese navy is essential to ensure lasting peace in the Pacific. Gui stated, "We sincerely hope for the growth of the new navy, and the allied nations, for the sake of maintaining world peace, are assisting in the construction of our new navy with extremely valuable enthusiasm. The internal and external situations demand this, which is indeed an excellent opportunity for our country to establish a navy."

Regarding the current state and facilities of the navy, Gui made a comprehensive report: (1) After strict rectification of naval administration, naval orders are now absolutely unified and implemented throughout all naval organizations, from Hainan Island and the Nansha Islands in the south to Huludao in the north. (2) Due to orders to tighten the military this spring, the naval personnel quota was limited to 32,000 men. Currently, due to the increase in naval vessels, it has been ordered to expand to 34,500 men. (3) After reorganization, the naval fleet now has the First and Second Coastal Defense Fleets, a River Defense Fleet, and a Transport Fleet, totaling four fleets, along with ten gunboat squadrons, stationed at various coastal and river defense bases, responsible for maintaining order. (4) Naval bases have been established with headquarters in Shanghai-Qingdao, Zuoying, and Yulin Port. Additionally, eleven patrol offices have been established within the military regions of each base headquarters and the Yangtze River Defense Zone, including Huludao, Dagu, Dinghai, Keelung, Magong, Xiamen, Huangpu, Haikou, Nanjing, Hukou, and Xikou. (5) Military supplies are independent, finances are open, and a supply system is established. Personnel of the Fourth Department of the Naval Headquarters are dispatched by the Ministry of National Defense, and military supply personnel of the fleet are dispatched by the Fourth Department of the Headquarters of the Commander-in-Chief. Financial affairs are completely transparent. All naval operations are aimed at enabling the fleet to operate freely. Therefore, five main supply stations have been established within the main bases, and supply substations have been established in the tactical bases of each patrol office for centralized and distributed supply. (6) Consolidation and expansion of the ship repair and manufacturing capacity. Naval construction is primarily based on shipbuilding capacity and the development of light and heavy industries. Currently, there are naval shipyards in Shanghai-Qingdao, Zuoying, Yulin, Magong, Huangpu, and Dagu. Each patrol office has naval factories responsible for the repair and maintenance of existing naval vessels. (7) Unified naval training. Naval officer training is now concentrated at the Qingdao Naval Academy, while soldier training is concentrated at the Naval Petty Officer School. In addition, specialized training in shipbuilding, engine manufacturing, ordnance manufacturing, and electrical engineering is concentrated at the Naval Mechanical School. Regarding enrollment, a quota system based on the population of each province is adopted to avoid repeating factionalism.

Gui also mentioned the improvement of the naval communications network, the establishment of personnel systems, the compilation of regulations, the review of pacification work, and the reception of Japanese and American ships. In conclusion, Gui specifically pointed out that the primary problem encountered in naval construction is the cultivation of technical personnel and cadres. The Naval Headquarters has ordered all naval personnel throughout the country to return to military service. Starting this year, the Central Naval Academy will recruit students nationwide based on provincial quotas. Secondly, naval construction requires advanced industry and sophisticated scientific knowledge and cannot be achieved overnight. Gui also pointed out that China's coastline is approximately 10,000 kilometers, extending from the mouth of the Yalu River in the north to the Beilun River estuary in Guangdong in the south, spanning the territorial waters of seven provinces. To the south are the Nansha and Xisha Islands, and to the east are the Penghu and Taiwan Islands. There are approximately 3,400 islands of varying sizes along the coast, covering an area of over 40,000 square kilometers. Half of the coastline is completely exposed to the ocean. Without strong coastal defense, China will be threatened.

### Mobil Oil Executive, Mr. Mitter, Appeals for Aid to China

[United Press, Los Angeles, 1st] Mobil Oil Company's China branch executive, Mr. Mitter, spoke at the Far East Problems Conference today, stating that financial and technical assistance to China's commercial recovery is an urgent need in the East. It is said that if China's industry and commerce can regain freedom, the country can be stabilized. China's taking over the leadership position lost by Japan in the Far East is beneficial to the entire world. China has the resources and intelligence to become self-sufficient, but it needs assistance at this time.

### The Four Powers' Allocation of Japanese Warships: Unrelated to Reparations Claims; Shang Zhen Cables That It Is Handled as a Special Case

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 2nd] According to naval sources, the allocation of Japanese warships by lottery among the four countries (China, the US, the UK, and the Soviet Union) in Tokyo is a special case and is unrelated to the issue of Japanese reparations to the Allied nations. The head of our delegation to Japan, Shang Zhen, also sent a cable to the Naval Headquarters stating, "The allocation of warships by various countries is a special case and is unrelated to reparations claims. If there are any misrepresentations in domestic newspapers, it is hoped that they will be corrected."

### Envoy Wei Visits Leaders in Beiping, Expresses US Willingness to Help China Achieve Prosperity and Strength; Mission Scheduled to Depart for Tianjin Tomorrow and Transfer to Shenyang for Inspection

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 2nd] Wedemeyer, accompanied by Captain Wu Hanmin, visited the military and political leaders of Beiping on the morning of the 2nd. At 9:30 a.m., he went to Jurenhall to visit Li Zongren, who personally greeted him at the gate and escorted him inside for a cordial conversation lasting one hour. Li gave a concise explanation of the situation in North China. At 10:30 a.m., he departed for the Baoding Pacification Headquarters and the Beiping Command Post on Tieshizi Hutong to visit Deputy Director Sun Lianzhong, with Chen Jicheng also present. Wedemeyer had met Sun in Chongqing when he served as Chief of Staff of the China Theater. They were delighted to meet again after a long separation. In addition to expressing his special welcome from Baoding, Sun also explained the work of the Baoding Pacification Headquarters. Wedemeyer departed at 11:20 a.m. to visit He Siyuan at the Municipal Government, with Deputy Mayor Zhang Bojin also present. Upon learning that He had studied in Germany, Wedemeyer switched to fluent German and conversed with He. During the conversation, he stated: (1) The US has no demands on China, but only hopes that China will become a prosperous and strong country, becoming a stabilizing force in East Asia. Under this principle, the US is willing to provide China with friendship and assistance. At this point, Wedemeyer regretted that after the US donated materials from the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) to several European countries, the "USA" logo was often painted over. He replied, "Please check if this is happening in China," and they both laughed. (2) Wedemeyer hopes that China will embark on the path of democracy, especially hoping that social elites and intellectuals will enthusiastically participate in politics. (3) Wedemeyer stated that he loves Beiping very much, that his mother had lived in Beiping for a long time, and that Beiping's terrain, climate, and all conditions are suitable as a capital. He said that Beiping's urban plan is still being designed according to national needs, but this has not been instructed by the central government. At 12:10 p.m., Wedemeyer returned to the consulate. Li Zongren, Sun Lianzhong, and He Siyuan originally planned to host separate banquets to welcome him. Now, in order to reduce Wedemeyer's social engagements, Li Zongren decided to host a solo banquet for Wedemeyer at 8 p.m. tomorrow, inviting Sun Lianzhong, He Siyuan, Chen Jicheng, Hu Shi, Mei Yi-chi, and others to accompany him.

[United States Information Service, Beiping, 2nd] General Wedemeyer received the leader of the American Church, Pastor White, acting president of Yenching University, Adolf, President of Tsinghua University, Dr. Mei Yi-chi, President of Catholic University, Dr. Hu Shi, and three members of the Democratic Socialist Party this afternoon.

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 2nd] Wedemeyer spoke with Mr. Mei Yi-chi today from 4:10 p.m. for half an hour. Wedemeyer said that the US is very willing to help China, but how should it help? Mei replied, "American help is indispensable to China. Without American aid, China will feel more and greater difficulties. I hope that the United States can help improve people's lives and help China engage in construction." Wedemeyer mentioned the "Dongdan" and "Shen Chong" incidents, saying that rape cases occur in China and foreign countries, and it is not uncommon for them to occur in the military. Why did this cause such a big storm? Before meeting Mei, Wedemeyer had a conversation with the acting president of Yenching University, Lu Zhijing, for one and a half hours. Lu told reporters after departing that he had generally discussed Sino-US relations with Envoy Wei. He expressed what the Chinese people hope for in the development of US policy and what should not be done.

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 2nd] Liang Qiushui of the Democratic Socialist Party Innovation faction told reporters after departing from Envoy Wei's residence that he had said what others dared not say, and had pleaded for the poor who could not survive under corruption and war. Wedemeyer expressed sympathy.

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 2nd] From 8 p.m. to 10 p.m. on the evening of the 2nd, US Consul General Freeman held a cocktail party for Envoy Wei. High-ranking military and political officials, as well as cultural, educational, and social celebrities, were invited. Also, today, an elderly man of 65, Xie Daoan, requested to meet with Envoy Wei but was rejected. It is known that this old man had requested to see President Chiang and Marshall when they came to Beiping, but was rejected. Wedemeyer's economic advisor, Walker, also began an investigation today. At 2:20 p.m. in the afternoon, he met with Ma Shiliang, director of the Beiping office of the Resources Committee, Bao Guobin, general manager of the Hebei Electric Power Company, Chen Dashou, general manager of the North China Iron and Steel Company, and Lu Zongxian, general manager of the North China Cement Company. Ma and the other four brought written materials and explained the unstarted industrial and mining situation in North China. It is known that Walker paid particular attention to heavy industry in North China. In addition, General Wedemeyer's mission held brief meetings with American personnel from the US consulate all day. Each member of the mission discussed various special issues individually.

People Send Letters to the US Consulate Expressing Hopes for Friendly Nations

[United Press, Beiping, 2nd] The US Consulate here received a large number of letters from the people of North China today, all wanting to tell General Wedemeyer how the United States should act toward China. US Consul Freeman has also been extremely busy this week, meeting with people from all walks of life, taking the same views. According to US Consul's talk with people about Miss Willis, the British missionary, hopes that Wedemeyer will make a broadcast to the CCP area to urge them to lay down their arms and stop all kinds of pranks. I am afraid that Wedemeyer cannot use his reserved broadcasting time for this speech.

It is also learned that the US Consul in Changchun, Kreps, flew from the Northeast to here last week to prepare to report on the situation in the Northeast to Envoy Wei.

[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 2nd] Yu Bin and Pan Chaoying will come to Shenyang before Wedemeyer. Also, Mo Dehui, a member of the government committee, will also come to Shenyang in the short term. Zi and others are helping to collect data at Wedemeyer's invitation. It is also rumored that Zhang Qun was ordered by the Chairman to come to the Northeast to inspect the general administrative situation.

[Our Newspaper, Hankou, 2nd] It is reported that Wedemeyer and his party of eleven may come to Hankou on the 18th to collect Wuhan industrial and commercial data. The Hankou Municipal Government and relevant agencies are now preparing to respond.

[Our Newspaper] The four representatives of the Democratic League in Beijing have all returned to Shanghai on the 1st. According to Ji and others, reporters said that they had visited Envoy Wei in Beijing and exchanged views on the situation, but did not submit any documents. The former mission had hoped that the Democratic League could provide some information, so they had prepared for it, but for caution, they will hold a meeting in the next few days to discuss it again. The representatives are very silent about their views on Wedemeyer's mission, saying that everyone has their own views and is unwilling to publish them. However, they believe that the rumor that the government will be reorganized again will not be realized in the short term. Also, the Democratic League will convene a regular meeting in one or two days to discuss it.

### Xi'an Pacification Headquarters Proposes Plan to Establish Border Area Pacification Headquarters

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 2nd] It is learned that 26 counties, including 19 counties such as Yan'an in northern Shaanxi, 6 counties such as Qingyang in Gansu, and Chi in Ningxia, are located at the intersection of the five provinces of Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, Shanxi, and Suiyuan. Because they have been occupied by the Communist bandits for many years, the administrative regions have been divided. In order to strengthen administration in conjunction with military affairs to facilitate governance, the Xi'an Pacification Headquarters has specifically proposed a plan to establish a Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Area Pacification Headquarters in Yan'an to manage all military, political, party, and group affairs. It is requested that all expenses in the listed areas be borne by the central government for one year. At the same time, it is also requested that the central government bear the administrative expenses for the recovered areas in northern Shaanxi for one year. After the two cases were submitted to the Executive Yuan, the Ministries of Interior, Finance, and National Defense jointly reviewed them and submitted them to the Executive Yuan for decision. In terms of organization, the Pacification Headquarters will be changed to the Shaanxi Northern Administrative Office, and the Gansu Provincial Government will strengthen the organization of the Longdong Supervisory District, which has been approved by the Chairman. As for the funding part, the subsidy standards for the recovered counties in the pacification area will be adjusted and increased appropriately. The Executive Yuan then doubled the subsidy fees and emergency relief funds for the recovered counties in the pacification area. However, at the administrative symposium, Chairman Zhu proposed to maintain the original plan, which is that the central government should bear the administrative expenses of 7.145 billion yuan per month for each level of administration in northern Shaanxi for one year. The Budget Review Committee of the Executive Yuan discussed the case in detail at its meeting on the 2nd, which took a long time and has not yet reached a final conclusion.

### Food Department Business Review Meeting Discusses Proposals from Various Units

(D) Questions raised by the Allocation Division (1) Reiterate the precautions for the allocation of military power in the Field Tax Business Review Meeting on May 1 of this year, (2) Adjustment of grain transportation prices in 1947.

(E) Questions raised by the Finance Division (1) The allocation of funds for the purchase of military grain in various provinces in August and September of this year, (2) The case of grain bonds in various provinces in 1931 and 1932, which are due for principal and interest in each year (the case of Hena Province's 1931 treasury bonds not being distributed, and how to pay the principal and interest due in each year from 1933 to 1936, and the case where the field tax in various provinces was exempted or partially exempted after the victory, and all the principal and interest of the treasury bonds due in that year were ordered to be deferred for one year, and how should the treasury bonds to be repaid this year be calculated).

(F) Questions raised by the Accounting Office (1) Regarding institutional expenses, (2) Regarding the settlement of grain accounts and grain funds.

(G) Questions raised by the Control Division Regarding the free flow of controlled rice, wheat, and flour. The free flow of food is of great importance to regulating surpluses and deficiencies, especially rice, wheat, flour, and other grains, which are the main food for the people. How should various provinces make them flow freely and mutually balance surpluses and deficiencies? Those in the producing areas should be transported to the sales areas, and they must not seek local stability, attempt to protect themselves, and close customs and prohibit transportation without authorization.

### Military Aircraft Missing En Route from Dihua to Lanzhou

[United Press, Dihua, 1st] The Dihua Air Force Headquarters announced today that an Air Force C-47 transport plane, carrying 26 passengers, which flew from here to Lanzhou on July 30, has been declared missing today. The plane departed at 6:50 a.m., arrived safely in Hami, and continued to take off. En route, it was turned back due to weather, stayed overnight, and then flew to Lanzhou again at 2:50 p.m. the next day. It contacted ground radio stations along the way using wireless radio. At 4:50 p.m., it flew near Jiayuguan, and the wireless radio contact suddenly broke off. Air Force personnel here said: The weather was clear at the time, and there seemed to be no mechanical obstacles. The plane is believed to have flown the wrong route.

### Mr. Xu Shiying Talks to Our Reporter: Mongolia and Tibet are Generally Peaceful; The Xigong Banner Incident Will Be Handled Quickly and Carefully

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 2nd] Xu Shiying, Chairman of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, met with our reporter on the 2nd and stated: Since taking office two months ago, although one or two minor incidents have occurred in Mongolia and Tibet, the overall situation remains peaceful. The religious and political strife in Tibet is a thing of the past, and the dependents of Reting have been generously compensated. Many newspaper reports regarding military affairs are mostly based on conjecture and are simply old news being presented as new. As for the murder of Queen Qijunfeng of the Xigong Banner in Suimeng and her young son, it is not a particularly serious incident and can be handled based on the principle of emphasizing both the law and the facts. The Queen's family will receive generous compensation, and the guilty subordinates will be punished. Furthermore, the political and personnel affairs of the Xigong Banner will certainly undergo an adjustment that will satisfy the banner's soldiers and civilians. Xu said: Political disputes within Mongolia and Tibet are common occurrences. The murders of Reting and Qijunfeng are sharp manifestations of these disputes. The central government's attitude towards the political affairs of border compatriots has always been lenient and fair, and it will continue to adhere to this principle in the future, actively preventing problems before they arise, so as to avoid the unfortunate recurrence of bloodshed. As for the point that political disputes among border compatriots could affect the defense of the borders, it is indeed a matter that should be given attention. However, as transportation between the interior and the border areas becomes increasingly convenient and misunderstandings between the two sides decrease, from the perspective of our policy of governing the border areas, it does not seem necessary to worry prematurely. Mr. Xu was in high spirits, and after a lengthy and patient conversation, he instructed his subordinates to send another telegram to the Sui Provincial Government, the Mongolian Political Council, and He Xianlin, the director of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission's office in Peiping (currently in Suiyuan), urging them to handle the Xigong Banner incident quickly and carefully.

[Central News Agency, Guisui, 2nd] Chairman Dong sent Ba Jingyuan, the head of the Mongolian Banner Welfare Committee, to the Xigong Banner to investigate the murder case of Qijunfeng and her son. He returned to Guisui on the 1st to report his findings. According to him, the Xigong Banner is currently as peaceful as ever, and the bodies of Qijunfeng and her son have been placed in coffins and are lying in state at the public temple. The Sui Provincial Government's handling of this matter seems to focus on stabilizing the local order of the banner, and the handling methods have not yet been announced. Key officials will be sent to the Xigong Banner again within days. Prince Ba, the head of the Ulanqab League, expressed that the incident in the Xigong Banner should be handled with care. Prince Ba is old and has difficulty moving around, so his son, Prince Lin of the Zhonggong Banner, will come to Guisui within days to pay respects to Chairman Dong, convey Prince Ba's views on the handling of the Xigong Banner incident, and provide them to the Sui Provincial Government for reference (Prince Ba's full name is Ba Shiduorji, and Prince Lin's is Linqinsengge). (Please see page 5 for the details of the murder of Qijunfeng and her son.)

### The National Socialist Party General Assembly Passes Several Proposals

[Our Newspaper] The National Socialist Party General Assembly held a general meeting yesterday morning to discuss proposals. A total of fourteen political proposals and seventy-six party affairs proposals were passed. During the morning session, it was also resolved to retroactively approve the "Political Program of the Chinese Democratic Socialist Party," which was passed by the joint meeting of the National Socialist Party and the Democratic Constitutionalist Party on August 18th of last year.

### We and Pakistan Consider Exchanging Ambassadors

[Reuters, Nanjing, 2nd] According to sources close to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the issue of exchanging diplomatic representatives between China and Pakistan is being seriously considered by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The point to be considered is whether to appoint one ambassador to serve concurrently as ambassador to both India and Pakistan, or to appoint two ambassadors to reside in the two countries separately. As for the fact that China will exchange diplomatic representatives of a certain level with India and Pakistan, there is no doubt about that. The spokesperson also said that exchanging diplomatic representatives between China and Burma is also under consideration.

He is scheduled to fly to Shanghai and then to Peiping next week, and will call on Chairman Chiang again before his departure.

### Rampant Gold Black Market in Macau; Philippine Government Forbids the Continued Transport of Gold

[United Press, Manila, 2nd] Philippine Finance Minister Cuaderno announced today that there is an international gold black market in Macau, involving gold bars and Mexican gold coins worth millions of dollars. Chinese merchants, fearing the devaluation of legal tender, are willing to pay high premiums to buy gold. Although the International Monetary Fund has stipulated that the price of gold is US$35 per ounce, the market price in Macau has reached at least US$51 per ounce. This high premium has led to a large influx of gold into Macau, where Chinese merchants can freely buy gold without fear of it being confiscated by the National Government. The Philippine government has now cooperated with the International Monetary Fund to ban the transport of gold to Macau and other places where the black market is rampant. The Ministry of Finance refused to approve multiple applications for exports to Macau last week, worth more than 5 million pesos, or about 2.5 million US dollars. The amount of gold exports to China has increased sharply since the continuous fluctuations in the value of the Chinese currency in February of this year, which has attracted the attention of the Philippine government.

### Supervisory Committee Suggests Political Reform: Separation of Military and Civilian Affairs, Strict Implementation of One Person, One Position; All Sixteen Items of the Proposal Sent to the National Government for Adoption

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 2nd] Supervisory Committee members Yu Shude, Wang Xuan, and 43 others recently submitted a "Proposal to the National Government on Reforming Politics and Urgent Matters to be Implemented, Consisting of Sixteen Points for Adoption." The proposal has already been sent out, and the contents reportedly include two major parts: politics and economy. In the political aspect, it first mentions severely punishing corruption in order to restore order. It suggests establishing a military officer disciplinary committee as soon as possible, and hopes that the disciplinary cases previously submitted by the Supervisory Yuan will not be shelved. For the takeover and investigation matters, it is hoped that those who have been found guilty will be brought to justice as soon as possible. The proposal also mentioned the gold case that has attracted attention from all parties, hoping that the authorities will severely punish the main culprits in the case. Second, it mentions strictly practicing thrift and strictly prohibiting extravagance. The main points of this item include continuing to implement the wartime thrift measures, strictly prohibiting the import of luxury goods, etc. Other key points in the political part include implementing the separation of military and civilian affairs, local officials not being appointed by military personnel, strictly prohibiting concurrent positions, strictly implementing one person, one position, dividing powers and responsibilities, abolishing special local systems, reducing and merging redundant institutions, improving and unifying the treatment of public and education personnel, so that the treatment of personnel in state-owned enterprises does not exceed that of other personnel, and strictly prohibiting disguised increases in treatment under the guise of employee welfare. The economic part is divided into three major categories, including tightening fiscal expenditures, thoroughly investigating the use of foreign exchange and punishing those who waste it, saving loans, improving the tax system, preventing the widening gap between the rich and the poor, cracking down on bureaucratic capitalism, and strictly supervising financial enterprises.

### Administrative Symposium Successfully Concluded: Strengthening Central-Local Communication

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 2nd] After the grain conference, the Executive Yuan convened four administrative symposia for the chairmen of various provinces in Nanjing, two of which (July 31st and August 1st) were held from 9:00 PM to around 1:00 AM. According to inquiries from the Executive Yuan and several provincial chairmen, the main spirit of these four meetings was to gather the provincial chairmen and the heads of the various ministries and commissions of the central government together. The provincial chairmen took this opportunity to report to the central government on the problems and difficulties encountered locally, as well as their requests to the central government. The Executive Yuan was able to fully listen to the facts and opinions presented by the provincial chairmen, examine, analyze, and instruct them, and put forward the central government's hopes for the local governments, so that the central and local governments could understand each other and jointly plan the way to implement national policies. Before each symposium, the provincial chairmen held preparatory meetings to exchange views and elected Chairman Shen Honglie as the representative in the symposium to speak on their behalf in a concentrated manner. The Executive Yuan side responded separately through the heads of the relevant ministries and commissions. President Zhang also gave instructions at any time. As a result of the discussions, some issues have been specifically decided, some issues have only been decided in principle, and for issues that could not be resolved immediately, the central government will consider and study them. The focus of the discussion was nothing more than the following items: (1) During the constitutional preparation period, the coordination of politics in various provinces with constitutional government. (2) The mobilization of local human, financial, and material resources and the coordination of all economic and political construction with military affairs during the general mobilization period. (3) Ensuring local public order, and rationally adjusting local institutions and finances. In the last symposium on August 1st, President Zhang also gave general instructions to the chairmen of various provinces.

### Overall Victory in Shandong Province is Established: Dongkou and Linpu Gatherings Recaptured, Retreat Routes of Liu's Bandits Cut Off; Communist Bandits on the South Bank of the Yellow River Will Be Completely Annihilated

[Our Newspaper, Jinan, 2nd] The overall victory situation in Shandong Province has been established. Now, with complete preparations, troops are advancing in multiple directions, and the communist army on the south bank of the Yellow River can be completely resolved in the near future. In recent days, the 1st and 4th columns of the communist bandits were encircled and suppressed by the national army's land and air forces in the Jinjiazhuang area west of Teng County, and most of them were annihilated. The remnants crossed the Si River eastward and fled northward.

[Our Newspaper, Xuzhou, 2nd] The remaining troops of Liu Bocheng, four and a half columns and one independent brigade, in Tangjiakou, Dayi Gathering, Songshan Gathering, Huotian Gathering, and other places north of Jixiang City, have partly fled north to the area north of Juye and Jiaxiang. The bandits believe that it is impossible to cross the Yellow River northward due to the rising river water in recent days. In addition, Dongkou and Linpu Gatherings have been recaptured by the national army on the night of the 1st, cutting off the bandits' retreat route. Therefore, this bandit army is already in a state of panic and it will not be difficult to completely annihilate them. Chen Yi's two columns and one division, totaling about 70,000 people, who had fled to Guoliji, Daxiaohucun, and Jinjiazhuang on the east bank of Dushan Lake, broke through and fled north to the area between Wenshang and Shenyang after being encircled and suppressed by the national army for days. After merging with the remnants of the two columns who had originally fled there, they appeared to be continuing to flee northward across the Wen River. The national army is continuing to encircle and suppress them.

[Our Newspaper, Jinan, 2nd] The Battle of Linqu has come to an end. The national army is continuing to pursue the bandits retreating towards Yidu Zhu and Liushanzhai and Fengyu in the southeast of the city. The rumors of bandits counterattacking are not accurate. In addition, the bandits in Yangshan Gathering, Dayi Gathering, and other places in southwestern Shandong are fleeing to the area north of Juye, and the national army is pursuing them. The Linqu situation has achieved results. According to preliminary investigations, more than 2,000 rifles, more than 200 light and heavy machine guns, and 10 artillery pieces have been seized. More than 3,000 prisoners of war and surrendered bandits have been captured. Other war trophies are still being inventoried. All sectors of Shandong Province have recently launched a fundraising campaign of 1 billion yuan to comfort the soldiers who defended the city of Linqu.

[Our Newspaper, Xuzhou, 2nd] Wang Yaowu left Jinan for Tai'an again on the 2nd to supervise the troops.

[Our Newspaper, Xuzhou, 2nd] The Yellow River Delta area on the Jinpu Railway in western Shandong has now returned to normal. The county seat has been fully grasped by the national army, and Juye was recaptured on the night of the 1st.

[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 2nd] The remnants of the 2nd, 3rd, 5th, and 9th columns of the communist bandits who were defeated in Linqu and fled north, and the remnants of the rapid column, are gathered in Yidu. The national army's pursuit troops have approached the outskirts of Yidu, and the recapture of the area is only a matter of time. In addition, the remnants of the 1st and 4th columns and the 13th division of the 5th column of the communist bandits who fled to the area near Guoliji were encircled and suppressed by the national army for days and fled in panic northward. The national army occupied Guoliji on the 1st and captured countless prisoners of war. In particular, the number of weapons seized was large because the bandit army suffered heavy casualties and fled without being able to carry them away, leaving them in Guoliji, which are currently being inventoried. The remnants of the bandits are now gathered in Sunjiadian (in the area between Jining and Ziyang), hoping to get a temporary respite. The national army is intensifying its encirclement and suppression.

[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 2nd] The communist bandits' East China Field Army in Shandong Province has suffered a disastrous defeat in the past month, and its main force has been almost completely lost. It is reported that Mao Zedong and Zhu De, the two bandit chiefs, are extremely dissatisfied with this and intend to completely cancel the serial numbers of the unit and its subordinate units.

[Central News Agency, Baoding, 2nd] Chaotic fighting has broken out on the outskirts of Cang County. Most of the main force of the bandits has withdrawn to the southwest area of the city. Only a small number of militiamen are resisting stubbornly in the urban area. The national army's armored units broke through Cang County this morning and searched southward along the North Canal. Now the national army can be stationed in the county seat at any time.

### Xikang Province Consolidates Land Taxes: Uncovers Land Gentry Arrears

[Our Newspaper, Ya'an, 1st] In order to reduce the burden on the people, the Xikang provincial authorities specially ordered each county to thoroughly consolidate land tax quotas. The consolidation results show that since there has never been a general household registration, the general grain people pay by means of name designation, and there are relatively few who pay taxes above ten yuan. It was also found that these grain people are all local powerful land gentry, and most of them have not paid even a single grain over the years. The general people who pay less than ten yuan have all paid without omission. The so-called "leaked or abused grain quota" is the amount not paid by these land gentry. The Xikang provincial authorities pay special attention to this and will thoroughly handle it to enrich the national tax.

### Overseas Chinese Returning Home with Foreign Currency - No Limit on Amount - Should be Exchanged for National Currency on Day of Entry

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 2nd] Regarding whether there are any restrictions on the amount of foreign currency notes that overseas Chinese compatriots bring back to the country, and what the procedures are for exchanging them into national currency, the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission requested an interpretation from the Ministry of Finance. According to the Ministry of Finance's reply: The "Measures for Prohibiting the Circulation of Foreign Currency Notes" only stipulate that Chinese and foreign people entering the country should declare and register the foreign currency notes they carry with them to the Customs. On the day of entry, they should exchange them for national currency at the official exchange rate at the local Central Bank or other entrusted places. Those who conceal them will have them confiscated. There is no limit to the amount of foreign currency brought in for exchange into national currency. However, at present, the Central Bank has not yet established exchange rates for currencies other than U.S. dollars, British pounds, and Hong Kong dollars, and cannot accept them for exchange. The Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission is still in negotiations. Before a result is obtained, it is hoped that our returning overseas Chinese compatriots will not bring back foreign currencies that cannot be exchanged.

### Wen Yuanning to Go to Nanjing Soon - To Discuss Personnel for Embassy in Greece

It is said that there is only one overseas Chinese in Greece

[This newspaper dispatch] A reporter visited Mr. Wen Yuanning, our country's newly appointed ambassador to Greece, yesterday to inquire about everything.

There is practically no overseas Chinese affairs in Greece, as there is only one overseas Chinese person there (from Ningbo), but Greece is particularly important in terms of politics and diplomacy. Mr. Wen also stated that after taking office, he will work hard in three areas: (1) to increase the understanding of Greece by all sectors of our country, (2) to strengthen Sino-Greek cooperation, and (3) to promote cultural exchange between China and Greece, as both Greece and our country are the birthplaces of world culture. The situation in Greece is currently stable, with only localized conflicts in the north. Due to Greece's importance in politics and military strategy, British and American aid to Greece will increase rather than decrease, and the various developments in the Greek situation will also have an indirect impact on the situation in the East.

### U.S. Military Commits Assault in Nanjing at Midnight - Two of Our Soldiers Thrown into Water and Drowned - U.S. Advisory Group Says Suspects Detained

[This newspaper dispatch, Nanjing, 2nd] At half past midnight on the 2nd, an international tragedy occurred on the Zhonghe Bridge outside Guanghua Gate in Nanjing. Wang Shouben, a driver from our Air Transport Brigade, and Ge Fating, a nurse from the Fifth Air Force Brigade, were "dragged" by two of the four U.S. soldiers driving past while they were relaxing, thrown into the moat, and tragically drowned. According to Tu Zhonghai, an eyewitness who narrowly escaped with his life, the perpetrators laughed wildly after committing the crime and calmly drove away in a jeep. After receiving the report, the Capital Police Department immediately ordered people to retrieve the bodies and sent personnel to investigate the details overnight. The U.S. military police also sent personnel to the scene to investigate.

According to the Capital Police Department, everything will be resolved in accordance with international law, and it is hoped that all parties will remain calm.

### Officialdom's "Conservatism" - Hindering the Development of the U.S. Air Force - Content of Chennault's Speech That Was Banned from Broadcasting

[This newspaper dispatch] Yesterday was U.S. Air Force Day. The Nanjing U.S. military radio station had previously invited Chennault, the former commander of the Fourteenth Air Force, to deliver a speech. The speech criticized the current policies of the U.S. military. General Rooks, the head of the U.S. Military Advisory Group, considered the content of the speech to be inappropriate and ordered the U.S. military radio station to stop broadcasting it. A reporter from the English-language *China Evening News* recently learned the content of the speech from relevant sources. The main points are excerpted and translated as follows:

"I believe that the strength of the U.S. Air Force must be maintained and developed to permanently guarantee that the U.S. doctrine survives in our world. I do not want to make a sensational speech, but I would like to use simple words to point out to the people of the country one of the greatest dangers in the path of developing our country's air force strength. I have seen this danger for a long time, but I have not had a suitable name for it. Let me call it officialdom's conservatism. That is, the conservatism of those politicians at desks and in congress in Washington. These people are short-sighted, saving small amounts of money but suffering great losses, preferring to waste countless sums of money in wartime rather than making limited investments in peacetime to maintain technological progress. The United States cannot allow the technological development of the air force to be too disconnected from the actual application of national defense. We can no longer ignore such new technological developments, as we have done in the past. These are my personal thoughts and hopes for U.S. Air Force Day."

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 2nd] Regarding the Central News Agency's New York dispatch on the 1st, which stated that the *U.S. Commerce Daily* was surprised that our semi-official announcement that this year's cotton production could reach 11 million bales was weak, Mr. Sun Enlin, director of the Cotton Production Improvement Office, stated that the expected increase in cotton production in our country this year is 12.5 million dan. According to the international metric system, each bale is equal to 500 pounds, which should be about 2.755 million bales. The reported number of 11 million bales should be a mistake for 11 million dan.

### Weekly Forum: Several Economic Issues of the Treaty of Peace with Japan

— Ding Zhijin

Two years have passed since the end of the war, but the peace treaty has not yet been signed. This is an unprecedented phenomenon in the history of international wars. However, most countries do not want to sign the treaty of peace as soon as possible. Especially the United States, which hopes to conclude the treaty of peace as soon as possible, is the most urgent. Because after the treaty of peace is signed, not only can the troops stationed in the defeated country be withdrawn, but also trade with the defeated country can be restored, which is enough to reduce the burden on taxpayers. Recently, the United States issued a notice inviting eleven countries in the Far East to hold a preliminary meeting on the treaty of peace with Japan on August 19. This is based on this motive.

The highest purpose of the treaty of peace with Japan is to prevent Japan from launching aggression again. To achieve this goal, of course, efforts must be made in military, political, economic, cultural and educational aspects. But as human civilization has developed to this stage, we believe that the economy is the most fundamental and realistic aspect. Fifty years ago, the teachers in Japanese schools were asking: "Where are the best peaches produced?" The students were answering: "The best peaches are produced in China!" The most fundamental motive for Japan's deliberate launch of aggression against China was to seize China's rich resources. As the technology and scale of warfare have developed today, economics has undoubtedly become the decisive factor. Japan was able to launch the war of aggression against China entirely because of its industrial superiority. And it is undeniable that the United Nations was able to win the final victory because of the vast productivity of the United States. Future wars are entirely "wars of production" and "wars of economic power." Therefore, in the treaty of peace with Japan, the economic part is something that all countries must fight for, especially our country, which must not allow even a trace of negligence.

Here, we put forward several principles to examine:

First, Japan's industry must never be allowed to switch to wartime industry. In the world, only the Soviet Union's several five-year plans have used the blood and sweat of most of the people to build a huge military industry. Other countries rarely produce munitions with all their strength in peacetime. Japan will not boldly produce munitions with all its strength when the treaty of peace is first signed. But the Japanese people are a nation that can endure humiliation and has conspiracies and strategies. They will use various pretexts to establish and expand many industries. Once something happens, they can immediately switch to munitions industries. In today's environment where the conflict between the United States and the Soviet Union is becoming increasingly acute, the United States may condone Japan. But in China's view, this is tantamount to burying the results of the eight-year war of resistance. It is too dangerous for China. We must actively prevent the development in this direction in the treaty of peace, so that Japan's industry will not be allowed to transform into a wartime industry at any time in the future.

Second, Japan's economy must not be allowed to turn into a wartime economy. A country has a peacetime economic system in peacetime and a wartime economic system in wartime. The most important point of the wartime economic system is self-sufficiency. Food must be self-sufficient, and the raw materials, labor, and even machines for the munitions industry and the necessary civil industries must be self-sufficient. The best way is to establish a scale of industry and agriculture in peacetime that can stop imports at any time, and its own production is sufficient to meet the needs of all aspects during wartime. The second is to accumulate a large amount in peacetime for wartime use. In these two ways, neither of them should be allowed to be used by defeated Japan.

Third, Japan's future economic development should not conflict with our country's economic development. A defeated country must re-establish the country after signing a treaty of peace. We cannot hope that Japan's economy will always remain at the current stage. And in fact, Japan's economy has gradually recovered under MacArthur's support. Therefore, we must make its development not conflict with our country's development. China and Japan are both in East Asia, both in the temperate zone, and have many of the same products. For example, China produces silk and Japan also produces silk. China and Japan are both industrially backward countries, and the stages of industrial development are similar. The focus of industry also has many similarities. For example, the more successful industrial development in China at present is the textile industry, and Japan's exports are also mainly textiles. We should impose restrictions on this in the treaty of peace so that it cannot compete against us.

Based on these three principles, we can cite a few practical problems for discussion:

(1) Compensation issue Regarding Japan's compensation, we have heard about the Pauley Plan, the U.S. State Department's plan, the MacArthur Plan, etc. The impression we get is that one is more tolerant than the other, and the amount of compensation is reduced one by one. According to the Central News Agency's telecommunications on July 26, the United States will propose that all countries give up compensation claims. This is tantamount to a threat to China, which has been ravaged by the Japanese army. First, we need factory machines to produce the materials destroyed by the Japanese army during the war, to compensate for the suppression and destruction of China's industrial development during the eight years of war, and to revive industry and the economy after the war. Second, we should designate a batch of complete factories that are needed by our country and stipulate the date for demolition and relocation. Third, we should designate several kinds of Japanese industrial products needed by our country, such as gauze, fertilizer, and rayon, and stipulate the quantity and order them to pay compensation in installments and deliver them every year. Fourth, we should also demand cash compensation. Japan destroyed countless properties and houses in our country during the war. These real capital of Chinese citizens should be compensated by Japanese factories and products. However, Japan's aggression also caused inflation in our country, which has increased to this day. Japan is also responsible for this. We have the right to demand a large amount of cash compensation to stabilize our currency.

(2) Industrial level issue. The United States plans to retain or restore Japan's industry to the production level of 1930 to 1934, which is very terrible. Therefore, we believe that: First, the standard we adopt should be the standard of living rather than the standard of production. We know that from 1931 to 1937, Japan's production index increased three times, while the people's consumption index only increased by 40%. This is because most of Japan's production at that time was stored for war, and part of it became the profits and assets of the chaebols. Therefore, the increase in the level of production is not necessarily good for the general Japanese people. We should stipulate a standard of living for the Japanese people after the war, and then determine the amount of industry to be retained according to their needs. Second, the standard of living we adopt should not be the standard of living of the Japanese people before the war, but the minimum standard of living of the Asian people after the war. In the eyes of Americans who grew up in wealth, the standard of living of the Japanese people is already very low. But in the eyes of Chinese and Indians, the life of the Japanese people can be said to be extremely comfortable. The reason why the life of the Japanese people is superior to other countries in Asia is obviously the result of the aggression and plunder of neighboring countries' land resources and the economic exploitation of neighboring countries in the past 100 years. Today, the various invaded countries in Asia have united and, with the help of other allied countries, have overthrown Japan's aggression, but they still have to let her retain the fruits of aggression. That's a wrong! Today, Japan is shouting "hunger exports", but thousands upon thousands of Chinese are really gnawing on tree bark and grass roots. Therefore, we should first compare the living standards of the people of various countries in Asia, determine the lowest one, and then determine the amount of Japanese industry to be retained according to the needs of this standard.

(3) International trade issues Japan is a country that cannot be self-sufficient. In order to ensure that its peacetime economy cannot be turned into a wartime economy, we have said before that we want to make it so. Then, in order to meet the normal needs of the Japanese people in peacetime, Japan's foreign trade should naturally be opened. However, in the treaty of peace, we should also add a few restrictions on this: First, the types of imported goods must be limited to those that are really needed for people's livelihood. Even though we have dismantled the munitions industry in Japan, if we do not supervise its import trade, it can still import military raw materials from foreign countries for future use. Therefore, the types of goods it imports must be strictly restricted. Second, the quantity of various imported goods each year shall not exceed the difference between the actual consumption of such goods and the domestic production. Many goods can be used as necessities for people's livelihood in peacetime, but they become genuine military supplies in wartime. We cannot let Japan pretend to maintain people's livelihood and secretly store them. Even genuine necessities for people's livelihood that cannot be used for military purposes should not be allowed to be imported beyond the actual consumption gap and stored, because if Japan is to launch a war again, both necessities for people's livelihood and munitions are important. Third, the Chinese government should have the right to intervene in the types and quantities of goods exported by Japan to China at any time. Under today's foreign exchange and trade controls implemented in our country, the dumping of Japanese goods is not worth worrying about, but this kind of control will be abolished sooner or later. We recall the history of Japanese goods dumping and the bitterness of resisting Japanese economic aggression at that time, and we deeply feel that such a regulation is indispensable in the treaty of peace.

### Security Council Takes Drastic Action: Urges Immediate Ceasefire Between Dutch and Indonesians; Dutch Prime Minister Still Hopes for U.S. Mediation

[Special Dispatch] San Francisco, 2nd – United Press reports that the European Manager, to understand the Netherlands' position in the Dutch-Indonesian dispute, sent written questions to Dutch Prime Minister Beel, which Mr. Beel has answered. Question: What preconditions and guarantees does the Netherlands require before mediation can be realized? Answer: I firmly believe that U.S. mediation will facilitate a solution to the problem. Question: Do you think the war can end soon? Answer: I firmly believe that the goals the Netherlands wants to achieve will be achieved soon. Question: Is it true that Dutch troops are causing widespread destruction in various places? Answer: Untrue. On the contrary, Indonesia has implemented a scorched-earth policy, and the losses suffered by overseas Chinese are particularly heavy.

[United Press, Lake Success, 2nd] The United Nations Security Council, after resolving last night to urge an immediate ceasefire between the Dutch and Indonesians and to resolve the dispute through arbitration or other peaceful means, issued a note to the Dutch and Indonesian governments within hours. This is the most drastic action taken since the establishment of the United Nations organization. To implement the resolution, in accordance with the United Nations Charter, the Security Council's last resort is to resort to economic sanctions and sever diplomatic relations with all fifty-five member states. If necessary, it may also take land, sea, and air military action to maintain or restore international peace and security. Although Dutch Ambassador to the United States Kleffens told reporters after the meeting that he had no comment, both the Dutch and Indonesians are expected to comply with the Security Council's instructions.

[United Press, Lake Success, 1st] The Security Council, after discussing the Indonesian issue for only two days, decided tonight that the Netherlands and Indonesia should immediately cease fire and resolve the dispute through arbitration or other means. This unprecedented resolution is the first action taken by the United Nations organization since its establishment to directly stop a war. The vote was eight in favor and zero against, with the United Kingdom, France, and Belgium abstaining. The United Kingdom stated that abstention was not an exercise of the veto power. The French representative, Mr. Parodi, said that he would rather vote against it, but a negative vote would be an exercise of the veto power, which would eliminate the case, so he changed his vote to abstention. After the vote, the chairman, Syrian representative Mr. Gory, immediately ordered the Secretariat to notify the Dutch and Indonesian governments of this resolution. The Security Council then adjourned until next Monday. During today's five-hour discussion, the Soviet representative advocated that both sides' troops withdraw to their original defenses as a precondition for mediation, but this was ultimately rejected. The U.S. proposal, amended and passed by France, allowed the Security Council to recognize the Republic of Indonesia. The Dutch representative argued vehemently against this, saying that Indonesia has not yet become an independent country.

[United Press, Lake Success, 1st] The Security Council discussed the Dutch-Indonesian issue today. The British representative suggested that the issue be temporarily shelved until the United States has facilitated a reconciliation between the warring Dutch and Indonesian parties. Representatives from the United States and the Soviet Union both expressed their opposition. Soviet representative Gromyko also condemned the U.S.'s mediation efforts, ironically stating: "The Netherlands now clearly wants to control the current situation and continue until the Dutch army achieves victory. Therefore, I oppose the Security Council waiting for the results of the U.S. mediation before discussing it again." The Netherlands' current attitude of accepting mediation is clearly to delay the matter so that it can be in a "favorable position" in relation to Indonesia.

[Reuters, Nanjing, 2nd] A Foreign Ministry spokesman could not confirm the rumor circulating in diplomatic circles here that China supports the actions taken by India and Australia on the Indonesian issue in the Security Council. The government, on the other hand, said that the aforementioned rumor was an interesting speculation, but the Chinese Foreign Ministry has decided to wait and see how the situation develops before instructing its representative to the Security Council.

[United Press, The Hague, 2nd] The Dutch cabinet held a special meeting today to discuss the United Nations Security Council's demand for a ceasefire between the Dutch and Indonesians.

### Dutch Army Continues to Advance; Yogyakarta Declares Martial Law

[Central News Agency, Batavia, 2nd] A Dutch communique on the 2nd stated: "Dutch forces have occupied Bojong Wardojo in central Java, which is burning in a large fire." The communique also announced that Indonesian troops have infiltrated Dutch positions in various parts of Java. The communique made no mention of the United Nations Security Council's action yesterday, which decided that the war should cease. The Dutch commander-in-chief apparently has not had time to consider the United Nations' decision.

[United Press, Batavia, 2nd] According to a Dutch military communique, Dutch forces have occupied Kabandjahe, 50 miles south of Medan, the capital of Sumatra. As a result of Indonesia's scorched-earth policy, the city is engulfed in flames.

[Reuters, Batavia, 2nd] Indonesian radio reported that the capital of the Republic, Yogyakarta, has declared martial law. The government of the Republic has appointed Lieutenant General Urip Sumohardjo, Chief of Staff of the Army, as the military commander of Yogyakarta, assisted by ten generals, responsible for the city's defense. A Dutch communique announced that the oil depot at Cilacap port on the south coast of Java was set on fire by the Republic's army and is currently burning. The Republic's army is implementing a widespread scorched-earth strategy in central Java. Sugar factories, cigarette factories, and coconut factories have all been set on fire and destroyed.

### American Newspapers Comment on Dutch-Indonesian Dispute:

Saying it has Created Asian Power Solidarity

[United Press, San Francisco, 1st] The San Francisco Chronicle published a commentary today entitled "Asian Colonialism is Dead," stating that India's appeal to the Security Council on behalf of Indonesia and China's support for Indonesia suggest that, although Japan has been defeated, the results of its war-mongering seem to have won Asia's unity against Western control. Omens are appearing in the Asian sky: "The situation of division and rule for hundreds of years is over. If Asian nations can unite against colonialism, no one country or combination of countries can revive it. This is something that the world should see." Asia may still lag behind in technology and military strength, and one soldier from any Western country may have the power to kill a hundred Asians, but the guerrilla destruction and retaliation by hundreds of millions of Asians will eventually exhaust the resources and nerves of the colonial countries. If Western countries can recognize this inevitable fact, it will not only benefit their own countries but also the well-being of mankind.

### U.S. Mediation of Dutch-Indonesian Incident: State Department Opinions Diverge

[United Press, Washington, 1st] Some officials in the State Department's Far East Division recently stated that they are concerned that the U.S.'s mediation of the Indonesian incident, whether as a mediator or in some other capacity, may affect the U.S.'s friends and goodwill throughout Southeast Asia. It seems that officials within the State Department who are pro-Dutch and anti-Indonesian have been able to manipulate the U.S.'s actions regarding the Indonesian incident. According to "experts" within the State Department, opinions on the Indonesian incident are divided into two factions: those dealing with European affairs are fully supporting the Netherlands, while those responsible for Asian and Pacific affairs believe that Indonesia's reasons are sufficient. This matter is an open secret in Washington.

### Overseas Chinese Leader Huang Enshi Requests Earnest Protection for Overseas Compatriots

300 Refugees Escape to Medan

[Central News Agency, Batavia, 1st] Huang Enshi (brother of Huang Zhenqiu), a local overseas Chinese leader, today telegraphed Chairman Chiang and other ministers, requesting that concrete steps be taken to protect overseas Chinese in Java and Sumatra, and stating that allocating funds for relief may not be an effective way to guarantee the lives and property of overseas Chinese. The telegram stated that the suffering of overseas Chinese in Java and Sumatra from arson, murder, and robbery by Indonesian troops is more widespread and profound than the Tangerang Massacre. If our government does not have concrete protection measures, the 800,000 overseas Chinese in the two regions will face more terrifying and unimaginable dangers.

[Special Dispatch, Nanjing, 2nd] Diplomatic sources report that over 300 refugees who had been trapped in Deli, a large town 12 miles from Medan, by Indonesian troops have been rescued and have arrived in Medan. Our consulate in the area has provided shelter and relief. There are also many refugees in Tanjung Morawa, 40 miles from Medan, and our consulate is currently trying to rescue them. The consulate has also sent personnel to Air Molek to establish a relief branch, responsible for providing relief to the thousand-plus overseas Chinese who have been made homeless by the war.

### Foreign Minister to Attend Pan-American Conference in Person

Opening Date is the 15th of This Month

[U.S. News Service, Washington, 1st] The State Department announced today that Secretary of State Marshall will lead the U.S. delegation to the Pan-American Conference to be held in Rio de Janeiro on August 15. The purpose of the conference is to maintain international peace and security. The delegation announced today that the number of U.S. representatives is 39, including the State Department's Pan-American Defense Bureau and advisors from the U.S. Army. It is generally expected that other individuals will join the conference when it opens. The convening of this conference is based on an agreement reached at the Inter-American Conference on Problems of War and Peace held in Mexico City in February and March 1945. The purpose of this conference is to adjust wartime security measures in the Western Hemisphere to suit peacetime conditions.

### French Prime Minister Ramadier Describes Situation in Vietnam

[Reuters, Paris, 1st] Prime Minister Ramadier stated at a weekly press conference that, after French troops engaged in military activities in Vietnam, they have liberated most areas and important cities. From now on, it will only be necessary to eliminate the remaining resistance in the mountains and forests of the interior, so the French army must understand the tactics of the Viet Minh army and adopt guerrilla strategies. Vietnam has now once again become a French asset, and law and order have been restored in most areas.

### Soviet Union Attempts to Seize the Whole World; The U.S. Must Stop It: House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eaton Issues Warning

[United Press, Geneva, 2nd] House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eaton declared today that the Soviet Union has now "clearly expressed its intention to seize Europe and then seize the whole world." The United States must warn the Soviet Union to stop this plan to conquer the world, otherwise it may lead to war. We do not need to resort to force at present. By relying on the leadership of the major powers and small countries pursuing American democratic ideals, we can prevent the Soviet Union from stepping out of line. If the Soviet Union does not yield and learn the behavior of civilized countries, we should expel the Soviet Union from the United Nations organization and work alone. If we do not stop it now, we will inevitably be forced to use force one day. At that time, the Soviet military may be superior to us in terms of personnel and weapons, which will be a difficult task. However, we have the atomic bomb, and I firmly believe that the Soviet Union does not have it, at least not yet.

### International Trade Conference: Non-UN Member States Will Be Invited to Participate

[Reuters, Lake Success, New York, 1st] The United Nations Economic and Social Council today passed India's resolution inviting the Republic of Indonesia to participate in the International Trade and Employment Conference to be held in Havana, Cuba, in November. The vote was six in favor, four against, and eight abstentions. The resolution stated: "The Economic and Social Council recognizes that the Republic of Indonesia enjoys de facto authority in foreign commercial relations and recognizes that the participation of the Republic of Indonesia would promote the objectives of the conference. Therefore, it decides to invite the government of the Republic of Indonesia to participate in the United Nations Trade and Employment Conference." Those who voted against the resolution were the United Kingdom, the United States, the Netherlands, and France.

[Reuters, Lake Success, 1st] The United Nations Economic and Social Council decided today, by a vote of eight to four, that only United Nations member states would have the right to vote at the International Trade Conference in Havana. Eight members abstained. India and the United Kingdom argued that all participating countries, whether or not they were members of the United Nations, should have the right to vote, but this was rejected. The Council also decided to invite Albania, Bulgaria, Ireland, Finland, Hungary, Italy, Pakistan, Portugal, Romania, Switzerland, Transjordan, and Yemen, who are non-member states, to participate in the conference. In addition, Burma, Ceylon, Northern Rhodesia, and other countries with full autonomy in foreign affairs were also invited by the Council to participate at the invitation of the United Kingdom.

### Burmese New Cabinet Sworn In; Perpetrators of Political Assassination on Trial

[Special Dispatch] London, 2nd – The Burmese new cabinet led by Thakin Nu was sworn in this morning. Thakin Nu continues to serve as Prime Minister.

[Reuters, Rangoon, 2nd] The six perpetrators of the assassination of Aung San and others began a secret trial in the Rangoon court yesterday.

[Reuters, Rangoon, 1st] Ba Maw, the puppet Prime Minister of Burma under the former Japanese rule, was arrested today in connection with the cabinet massacre. He fled to Japan after Japan surrendered and later surrendered to the British authorities in Tokyo. He was returned to Burma, regained his freedom last year, and recently re-entered politics, criticizing Aung San's agreement with Prime Minister Attlee last year and planning to organize an opposition party.

### Two Factories in the U.S. Zone of Germany Manufacture War Materials for a Foreign Country; Five People in Charge Arrested by U.S. Military

[United Press, Berlin, 1st] It is reported that U.S. Army officials said that two factories in the U.S. Zone of Germany were manufacturing war materials for a foreign country without the permission of the U.S. military government. U.S. officials found a large number of hidden materials to avoid inspection, including aircraft, tanks, and gyroscopes for submarines that were half completed, parts for aircraft wings and bodies, theodolites for observing rocket flights, and periscopes for submarines. According to an official statement, Army, Economic Affairs, and Signals Corps officials discovered the above-mentioned hidden military supplies when inspecting two factories of the Askania Company in Mariendorf in the U.S. Zone, but officials did not name the foreign country. Subsequently, the U.S. stationed detectives around the factory, closed the factory gates, sent troops to search the interior, and arrested five people who were being held in custody in accordance with the Allied Control Authority's regulations prohibiting the manufacture, transportation, or possession of war materials.

[United Press, Berlin, 2nd] Colonel Boyle, the American investigator in charge of investigating two factories in the U.S. Zone that manufactured war materials for a "foreign country," said that the products manufactured by the two factories were orders from the Teltow Company in the Soviet-occupied zone. Teltow has close ties to the two factories, but Boyle refused to specify which country was the "foreign country." According to a German journalist, before the end of the European War and before the arrival of the U.S. military in Berlin, Soviet troops had moved much of the equipment from the two factories to the Soviet-occupied zone of Berlin, and several engineers and technicians went with them. After the news of the search of the two factories was released, German newspapers published it in large letters, but the Soviet organ newspaper only mentioned it briefly and omitted the section involving the "foreign country."

### Soviet Union Continues to Dismantle and Ship German Factory Equipment

[United Press, Berlin, 1st] The headquarters of the German Social Democratic Party in Hanover recently announced that the Soviet Union is once again dismantling factory equipment in batches and shipping it to the Soviet Union. Although the Soviet military authorities had previously stated for the third time in the spring that they would no longer dismantle factories as reparations, they are now actively taking this action.

### British Army to Begin Withdrawing from India on August 17; Two Dominions Responsible for Maintaining Law and Order

[Reuters, New Delhi, 2nd] The Indian Army Headquarters officially announced that the British Army will begin withdrawing from India on August 17. The first batch of withdrawing British troops will board ships from Bombay on that day after a commemorative parade. The official statement said: "The British troops stationed in India and Pakistan will not be assigned combat tasks or the responsibility of maintaining law and order. This task will be borne by the Indian Union and Pakistan. Before the withdrawal, all British Army units in the Indian Union and Pakistan will be under the command of Major General Wesseler, who will be the commander of the British Army in India and Pakistan from August 15." It is also learned that the headquarters of General Lockhart, Commander-in-Chief of the Indian Union Army, will be located in the Red Fort in Delhi. It is also learned that the Indian Union government has appointed Menon as High Commissioner to the United Kingdom, who will take office on August 15.

### Establishing a Democratic Japan: Mission Not Yet Accomplished; Australian Foreign Minister Issues Statement Before Leaving Japan

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 2nd] Australian Foreign Minister Evatt departed for home this morning. Before his departure, he stated: "General MacArthur has succeeded in eliminating Japan's war-making capabilities, but it is difficult to say that he has completely achieved his mission in establishing a democratic Japan. As for the U.S.'s proposed preparatory meeting for the peace treaty, it may be convened around the beginning of September, and the formal conference may be held in January or February next year."

The U.S. and Australia Have Similar Views on the Japanese Peace Conference Issue

[United Press, Yokohama, 2nd] Australian Foreign Minister Evatt, accompanied by his wife and Paul, the director of the Australian mission to Japan, left Japan on the Australian warship "Hobart" at midnight on the 1st, concluding his nine-day unofficial inspection tour. Before his departure, Evatt issued a statement saying that he and the U.S. authorities in Japan had reached a wide range of agreements on the main issues that would arise at the Japanese peace conference. Evatt reiterated his optimism about the early convening of the peace conference. Evatt also said that the opinions and advice given by MacArthur and other occupation officials were of utmost value to Australia in its future consideration of the security and well-being of the Pacific. The security and well-being of the Pacific are the goals we must pursue at the Japanese peace conference. This goal is not only related to ourselves but also to international peace and international justice. Australia believes that the Japanese peace conference should be negotiated democratically, granting the eleven countries that participated in the Pacific War full rights to participate in the conference and the future monitoring of the implementation of the treaty. This opinion of Australia has received widespread support here.

In mid-March of this year, 4,220 people resettled on Ie Island, which had been uninhabited for two years. Due to the increase in cultivated area, the estimated food production on the island in May, June, and July can supply two-thirds of the food needed. Politically, the report stated that although no political parties have appeared on the islands, the islanders are discussing the establishment of autonomous governments. The most important thing they are discussing is to make all administrative positions elected by the people.

### U.S. Air Force Day Celebrated Enthusiastically, "Dream Boat" Super Fortress Sets New International Flight Record

[United Press International, Washington, 2nd] To commemorate the 40th anniversary of the founding of the U.S. Air Force, celebrations were held in capitals such as Moscow, Tokyo, Berlin, Santiago, Paris, Nanjing, and major cities across the United States. The U.S. Air Force, which had 2.5 million personnel during wartime, has now been reduced to 310,000. Airfields were opened for public viewing. Air Force officials delivered speeches, urging the nation to pay attention to the continued expansion of the U.S. Air Force program. One of the biggest highlights of Air Force Day was the flight of seven B-29 Superfortress aircraft directly from Tokyo to Washington, covering a distance of 7,000 miles in approximately 30 hours, with only one refueling stop in Alaska. A squadron of P-80 Shooting Star aircraft flew from New York, Chicago, and Miami to Washington, setting an unofficial record of approximately 500 miles per hour on average. The "Dream Boat" Superfortress, famous for dropping the atomic bomb, set an official international record, covering a distance of 10,000 kilometers at an average speed of 277 miles per hour. The old record of 193.6 miles per hour was set by a Frenchman in 1939.

[United Press International, Newark, New Jersey, 1st] U.S. Army Commander Dunphoss, in his address at the Air Force Day commemoration here today, predicted that the atomic bomb may never be used in war, just as poison gas was not used in World War II. It is said that if the atomic bomb were used, both sides would inevitably engage in an atomic arms race, resulting in mutual destruction, with neither side able to achieve a true victory. Dunphoss also stated that U.S. infantry battalions and their artillery units can now be airlifted. In the future, entire U.S. infantry divisions and all their artillery units can be airlifted into combat, which may offer hope for avoiding war.

### Seoul Conference Deadlock Unresolved, U.S. Representative Clarifies Stance, Unwilling to Let Extremists Control Korean Politics

[New Asia News Agency, Seoul, 2nd] U.S. Major General Brown of the U.S.-Soviet Joint Commission issued a written statement refuting the Soviet proposal that only political parties with more than 10,000 members should be eligible for consultation, stating: "Several important political parties will not be able to meet this condition." The statement concluded: "The United States has no prejudice towards Korean political parties. The United States is concerned about the interests of the Korean people and does not want extreme left or extreme right political parties or groups to dominate and control the future political situation in Korea."

Soviet Explanation

[New Asia News Agency, Seoul, 2nd] Soviet representative Stikov held a reception for the press corps at Deoksugung Palace today, explaining in detail the reasons for the deadlock in the Seoul conference. Stikov stated: The Soviet side insists that all Korean political parties must provide a register of members, and only political parties or groups with more than 10,000 members are eligible for consultation. All political parties or groups that oppose the Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference Declaration and anti-trusteeship parties or groups are not eligible for consultation. The Soviet side also proposed that a committee be formed within the first subcommittee to specifically study this issue, but the U.S. side rejected it, which is the main reason for the deadlock in the Joint Commission. However, the Soviet representative will continue to work hard to implement its consistent position in order to promote the early formation of a unified Korean government and not disappoint the Korean people.

### British Statement on Geneva International Tariff Agreement, Declares Temporary Non-Signing, States that Britain Must Implement Discriminatory Import Controls

[Reuters, Geneva, 1st] The British government has informed the United States that it cannot sign the nearly completed multilateral tariff agreement in the Geneva Trade Conference unless the clause prohibiting discriminatory import controls is waived for Britain.

It is believed that British Trade Minister Cripps raised this issue when he met with U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Clayton in Paris yesterday. It is understood that Cripps told Clayton that Britain would not be able to avoid implementing discriminatory import controls for at least a year in order to conserve its foreign exchange reserves. U.S. officials believe that this statement by Britain will not only undermine the tariff agreement in the Geneva negotiations but also hinder the U.S. Congress from taking favorable action on the Marshall Plan for European aid. The establishment of a global trade rules agreement is likely to be shelved due to the lack of British support, in which case the only price the United States hoped to obtain for assisting Britain and European recovery will be in vain. The United States originally hoped to achieve its trade policy goals by completing the financial agreement with Britain and the recent launch of a plan to aid the post-war world. Now that Britain has definitely requested the United States to exempt it from fulfilling the obligation in Article 9 of the Anglo-American financial agreement not to discriminate against imports from the United States, if Britain refuses to sign the tariff agreement or obtains an exemption from the clause prohibiting discriminatory imports, countries in the Western Hemisphere and countries in the dollar area will suffer a major blow.

### Conspiracy to Murder for Money on the Same Car, Arrest of Briton Yetley, Admits to Having Traded with the Deceased, Strong Suspicion, Taken into Custody

[Reported by this newspaper] The Foreign Affairs Section of the Police Headquarters, together with the New City Branch, arrested a Briton named "Yetley" last night. His full name is "Charlie Archer". He is suspected of being the murderer who shot Yu Shengxiao in Qingpu County the night before last.

However, in Yetley Archer's confession at the police station, he flatly denied the charges. Moreover, many of the points he confessed were inconsistent with the testimonies of various witnesses, which raised suspicions. The police station personnel in charge stated that since yesterday was Saturday, they had not yet notified the British Consulate, so the details of the investigation could not be released to the public.

The incident involves a man from Ningbo named Yu Shengxiao, 31 years old, who started by selling steamed buns and other foods. Having accumulated savings, he also engaged in black market trading of gold and currency. One morning, a Westerner came to buy five gold bars and arranged to pay in the afternoon. At that time, the Westerner left in a car together, and when they drove to Wujiaxiang in Qibao Town, Qingpu County, Yu Shengxiao was suddenly shot by the Westerner and pushed into the wilderness. Villagers found him bleeding profusely and barely breathing. When asked what happened, he only said: "My name is Yu Shengxiao, I live at 623 Tiantong Road. The person who killed me is named Yetley." After saying this, he lost consciousness and died on the way to the hospital. He was shot three times, twice in the head and once in the chest.

After receiving the report, the police station went to 623 Tiantong Road to investigate based on the location mentioned. His wife said that her husband had been engaged in black market trading of gold and currency in the Central Road area and had been in contact with a Westerner named Yetley. Yetley had bought five gold bars from her husband that morning, and her husband had not returned since leaving.

After receiving the report, the Police Headquarters went to the Central Road area to investigate Yetley's whereabouts. They learned from Yu's colleagues that Yetley did exist and knew his address. They arrested him that night.

According to Yetley Archer's statement to the police investigators, he had only one transaction with Yu involving 60 U.S. dollars, and there were no other dealings. He did not arrange to meet Yu on the day in question. He returned home around 5:00 p.m. on that day and knew nothing about the shooting of Yu Shengxiao.

Last night, police officers repeatedly questioned Yetley Archer on relevant points, but Yetley Archer insisted that he did not own a vehicle and had never been to the Qingpu area.

Yetley Archer is a Briton, born in Hong Kong, 33 years old. During the enemy-puppet period, he met a Russian woman in a concentration camp. After the victory, they officially married. According to the Russian woman, Yetley Archer is a legitimate businessman and would never commit murder. He runs a business with a Chinese man named Lu on the upper floor of No. 15 Central Road. He left home that morning and returned home between 4:00 and 5:00 p.m. In the evening at 9 pm, they even went to the Jinmen Theater together to watch "Looking Back on the Old Days". At that time, he met a dentist who currently works at the Hongqiao Sanatorium, meaning that this dentist could testify.

When the Russian woman spoke about the above facts, she was very calm, but she was vague about the exact time Yetley Archer returned home and the dentist's name, unable to be precise.

The reporter then asked that if Yetley Archer was a legitimate businessman, he should have friends who could vouch for him. The Russian woman replied that Yetley Archer knew many British and American people, but she feared that they would not be willing to come forward to testify.

When asked where she lived, the Russian woman said: "No. 16 Albert Road," in a small inn run by a Westerner. However, when the reporter went to find it later, there was no such number. However, according to Yetley Archer's statement to the police station, he lived at "No. 4, Lane 186, Albert Road." When the reporter went to ask again, the place was an apartment-style small inn, but the owner insisted that there was no Yetley Archer living there.

It is generally estimated that it takes about one hour to travel by car between Qibao and Shanghai. Therefore, if the shooting occurred around 5:00 p.m., the murderer could have calmly returned to Shanghai before 9:00 p.m. Although his wife said that Yetley Archer returned home between 4:00 and 5:00 p.m., no one can confirm this.

When police officers went to Central Road to investigate with his colleagues, some people pointed out that Yetley Archer did indeed make an appointment with Yu Shengxiao that day to pay at the Fada Tailor Shop at Ningbo Road, Sichuan Road, between 3:00 p.m. and 4:00 p.m., and had witnessed him and Yu Shengxiao driving towards the Bund together. The police station believes that Yetley Archer and his wife are highly suspicious and has ordered them to be detained. An active investigation is underway.

### Young Woman with a Bad Reputation Tragically Killed by Her Husband, Lured to Hongqiao, Strangled and Abandoned, Note Found on Corpse Leads to Successful Case Solved, Garment Maker Arrested and Confesses After Interrogation

[Reported by this newspaper] Gu Fazhang, 28 years old, from Jingjiang, works as a garment maker in the Chengtai Fang No. 1 garment shop opened by Ni Xianhai on Gubal Road. Four years ago, he married a fellow villager Zhang (24 years old) in his hometown. They have no children. She came to Shanghai from the countryside half a month ago. Because it was not easy for Gu to find a house, he had his wife stay at a friend's house at No. 151 Panjiawan, Zhabei. Zhang had a bad reputation in the countryside for promiscuous relationships. Someone came to Shanghai to report this to Gu. Gu was very angry and interrogated her harshly, and there were several conflicts. Therefore, Gu had the idea of killing his wife. He discussed it with a person nicknamed "Bie San," wanting to put her to death. On the evening of July 29th, he made an appointment with "Bie San" somewhere. After Gu finished his work, he returned to the Panjia house and lured her out. They walked to the south of the Suzhou Creek and met "Bie San." They hired a taxi to go to a remote place in Xujiahui, but because there were so many people enjoying the cool air, it was inconvenient to act. They went to the ditch near the Huangjialang on Hongqiao Road. He paid the driver 36,000 yuan and told him to drive away. The three of them sat on the ground and chatted for a while. Unexpectedly, they used a rope to strangle her head and neck, then tied her hands behind her back and abandoned the body in the ditch. Afterwards, the murderer Gu Fazhang paid "Bie San" 150,000 yuan in legal tender as a reward, and they fled one after another. When Zhang was killed, she was wearing a white short shirt, black pants, jade-colored thread stockings, and blue shoes, with a cropped haircut. At 7:00 a.m. on the 31st, someone discovered the body and reported it to the Longhua Police Branch. After Director Xu of the branch ordered Squad Leader Lin to supervise squad members Guo Zhikai, Police Chief Chen Xianfa, Police Officers Zhou Chunfa, Wang Pei, and Zhu En Yan to rush to the scene to investigate, they found a piece of paper in the deceased's pocket with three addresses: (1) No. 84 Qianjiatang, Huanlong Road, (2) Zhao Yongxing Garment Shop, No. 63 Caishi Road, (3) Somewhere in Wuxi. According to the above locations, the police officers sent personnel to wait at No. 84 Qianjiatang. Gu Fazhang arrived at night, and they arrested him.

According to Zhang Xiaosong, the Director of the Civil Affairs Department of the Municipal Government: Recently, workers in various factories in the city have been requesting deferment from military service. However, according to the provisions of Article 26, Paragraph 1 of the Military Service Law, those eligible for deferment are limited to "currently employed professional technical personnel in national defense industries who have been reviewed and approved."

The identification of their status and the scope of deferment shall be determined by the Ministry of National Defense in consultation with the relevant competent authorities." According to the above legal provisions, eligible technical employees must be currently employed in relevant national defense industries and be irreplaceable. In other words, those who are not currently employed, are not involved in national defense industries, or can be replaced are not eligible for deferment.

The review of deferment procedures will be handled by the Municipal Government in conjunction with the Deferment and Exemption Review Committee under the Military Service Association.

### Monks Conscripted into Military Service: Temple Property Should Be Protected

[Our Newspaper's Report] After eligible monks are conscripted into active service, their temple properties are often coveted and encroached upon, which is enough to shake the monks' willingness to comply. The Ministry of National Defense has recently forwarded a consultation to the Ministry of Interior, ordering local governments to strictly prevent and guard against such occurrences and to effectively protect temple properties, so that monks have no worries before conscription and have a place to rest after discharge.

### Exemption/Deferment 慰待金: Stop Imposing It

[Our Newspaper's Report] In order to replenish the慰待金, the Municipal Government previously drafted provisional measures for exempting and deferring conscription and requiring壮丁(strong young men) to pay 慰待金. In the application guidelines for 壮丁 applying for exemption and deferment of conscription in 1947, it was stipulated that the fee would be collected incidentally. Later, the Military Service Association resolved that "the collection procedure is troublesome, and the estimated revenue is not sufficient for the 慰待 families of conscripts, so a new method should be drafted." The Municipal Government's Civil Affairs Department has notified all districts to stop the incidental collection. The Municipal Government is now concerned that the outside world may not be aware of the truth, or that 各保(various 保s) may still collect fees when 壮丁 apply, so it has issued another order to prohibit this. If any personnel collect fees under any pretext, 壮丁 are allowed to report them with evidence for investigation and prosecution.

### Gold Smuggling Case: Bank to Send Documents to Summon the Owners of Two Gold Shops

[Our Newspaper's Report] The major gold smuggling case cracked by the police bureau has shown signs of progress after days of investigation. It is reported that Chen Kechang, who was arrested, is an employee of the "Jiangxi Laowannian Gold Shop" in Wuchang. He was ordered by the shop owner, Zou Fengxiang, to bring 350 taels of gold bars to Shanghai. Through the introduction of Ku Bingyan, he sold them in the black market around South Wuxi Road on the 30th of last month. The proceeds of 800 million yuan were transferred by the Shanghai Trust Company to the Hankou Tongji Trust Company for collection, because the general manager of Tongji is one of the shareholders of Laowannian, named Nuo Jingxuan. Also, Hu Zhengshan and Wu Xingwen are employees of the "Laozou Xiehe Gold Shop" in Hankou. This time, they were ordered by the shop owner, Zou Runzhi, to bring 400 taels of gold by China Airlines to Shanghai. They also sold them in the black market on South Wuxi Road on the 27th of last month, obtaining 900 million yuan, which has been fully remitted. Currently, in order to thoroughly investigate this case, the Police Bureau may send documents to summon all relevant persons to Shanghai. After the Shanghai Trust Company's remittance was stopped by the Central Bank, the funds have been ordered to be handed over to the Central Bank for temporary custody, pending disposal.

### Woman Hides Talisman: Female Worker Loses Consciousness Instantly When Shoulder is Tapped

[Our Newspaper's Report] One day at around 9:00 AM, a local woman named Yan Ada was on her way to work at the Zhongxin No. 1 Factory when she encountered a woman, a stranger, on Hammi Road. The woman followed her closely to the vicinity of the Shunchang Stone Powder Factory on Changning Road. The woman tapped her on the shoulder, and Yan instantly lost consciousness, collapsing on the side of the road, feeling dizzy. Later, a female worker from the same factory, surnamed Yang, arrived and helped Yan up, and she gradually regained consciousness.

### Getting Rich is Not Always a Blessing: Tricycle Driver Faces Jail Time

[Our Newspaper's Report] Two months ago, a tricycle driver named Zhou Debao picked up two passengers, a man and a woman, in front of the Dahai Ballroom on Nanjing West Road and took them to the Lido Ballroom. The two passengers hurriedly got out of the tricycle, leaving behind a package. Zhou found the package, which contained a diamond ring, US$20, and HK$10. Zhou immediately went to the racecourse on Huangpi Road to sell the items quickly, selling them at a low price for more than 4 million yuan. He rented a vacant lot behind the Dafeng Cotton Mill and built a shack. He then sold the shack for 6 million yuan, having received 4 million yuan already, with 2 million yuan still outstanding. Someone reported the matter to the Sixth Inspection Brigade. Zhou Debao was summoned for questioning and confessed to the previous events. However, he refused to reveal who he sold the diamond ring to or where it is currently located. The case was transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office yesterday by the Garrison Command for investigation.

### Setting Up Fake Companies to Defraud: Receiving Deposits Totaling Hundreds of Millions: Avoiding Contact When the Due Date Arrives

[Our Newspaper's Report] A person named Xu Zhongping specializes in setting up fake offices, falsely claiming to buy and sell on behalf of customers, but actually defrauding them of deposits. Many people have been victimized. In May, Xu set up Wanfeng Trading Company at 668 Sichuan Road. Shao Qishun, the owner of Yuansen Hardware Store at 306 Anyuan Road, ordered 140 tons of steel plates and 200 tons of steel pipes, totaling 119.1 million yuan. Shao paid a deposit of 40 million yuan first. After May 18, Xu suddenly disappeared and changed his name to Pan Hanyuan. He then established Huafu Industrial Company at 91 Beijing Road, still engaging in empty trading. Yongsheng Gunny Bag Store ordered 10,000 gunny bags from him and was defrauded of a deposit of 10 million yuan in cash, 144 million yuan in promissory notes, and 126 million yuan in checks. Xinxing Dyeing and Weaving Factory ordered 30 boxes of vulcanized dye and 10 boxes of caustic soda and was defrauded of a deposit of 120 million yuan in checks. A gunny bag store at No. 4, Lane 83, Xizang Road ordered more than 20,000 gunny bags from him and was defrauded of a deposit of 50 million yuan in checks. When the due date arrived, he delayed delivery and avoided contact. The victims reported the matter to the police bureau. When the police went to search the company, they only found a broker named Zhang Kangyan. The police bureau believes that Xu has committed fraudulent acts and transferred the case to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation yesterday.

### Fabricating Information to Swindle Rewards: Zhou Gongquan Detained for Investigation

[Our Newspaper's Report] Zhou Gongquan (also known as Zhu Xuewen, 24 years old), a native of Nanjing, residing at No. 150, Hujiamuqiao Road, specializes in fabricating information and swindling rewards from military and police agencies in the city, totaling several million yuan. Recently, Zhou went to the Second Division of the Yulin Road Police Sub-bureau, claiming that three people, Zhu A'kui (also known as Luo Tao), Cao Guangdou, and Zhang Genlin, had robbed the Hongxiang Jewelry Store on Zhongzheng North Second Road on February 19. However, because they were related to the Inspection Division of the Dajin Garrison Command and a certain aviation unit, they were still at large. At that time, the sub-bureau, considering the case to be significant, urgently reported it to the Investigation Section of the General Bureau. The section chief dispatched staff members Feng Qushan and Zhang Changgui to jointly investigate. The result was that it was not a fact. Zhou was summoned to the bureau, and after detailed questioning, it was learned that it was completely fabricated. He also confessed that he had successively defrauded the Second Brigade of the Garrison Command's Inspection Team, the Water Brigade, the Shanghai West Military Police, and the Tilanqiao, Jiangwan, Hongkou and other police sub-bureaus of rewards amounting to several million yuan in the same way, which have all been spent.

### Placing Northern Henan Refugees in Foster Care: Henan Province Carefully Plans Relief Measures

[Our Newspaper, Kaifeng Dispatch] Recently, the number of refugees crossing south from northern Henan every day, gathering in Zhengzhou, Luoyang, Kaifeng and other places, is too large. To improve relief efforts, the Henan Provincial Government has instructed the Department of Social Affairs to draft measures for placing Northern Henan refugees in foster care. These measures were approved by the Provincial Committee on the 29th. Excerpts of the measures are as follows:

(1) Regarding the Zhengzhou area: (1) The Department of Social Affairs and Zheng County's emergency relief work, which was to end at the end of July, will, from August 1st, focus solely on refugee dispersal. (2) The Department of Social Affairs and Zheng County's emergency relief team, according to the original budget, was to be withdrawn at the end of July. From August 1st, a refugee dispersal station will be established in Zheng County. (3) Of the three porridge kitchens originally operated in Zheng County, the first one will be closed immediately, while the second and third will use existing materials and be closed when the food is depleted. (4) The 100 tons of food allocated by the Relief Sub-Administration will be mainly used to support refugee dispersal. (5) It is planned to transfer a portion of the emergency relief team to handle dispersal matters after the emergency relief work ends. A separate budget will be drafted and submitted to the Provincial Committee for review and approval. Before the central relief funds arrive, it is planned to temporarily borrow two hundred million yuan from the Grain Bureau to meet urgent needs.

(2) Regarding the Luoyang area: (1) In addition to the 100 million yuan already allocated for emergency relief in Luoyang, it is planned to establish a refugee dispersal station in Luoyang and allocate another 100 million yuan for refugee dispersal. (2) The Relief Sub-Administration will allocate 60 tons of food to Luoyang to support refugee dispersal.

(3) Regarding the Kaifeng area: (1) The Zhongmu porridge kitchen will continue to operate for the time being, and a Kaifeng refugee dispersal station will be established. (2) The Sub-Administration will allocate 40 tons of food to Kaifeng to support refugee dispersal, under the direction of the Department of Social Affairs. (July 30)

### External Transportation Suffocated: China Resembles an "Isolated Island"

[Our Newspaper Dispatch] Last year, Fuzhou averaged over two hundred ships entering and leaving its port each month. The situation has severely deteriorated in recent months, with very few ships on various routes. For example, the only passenger ship on the Fuzhou-Shanghai route, the "Zhoushan" has recently stopped running. The Fuzhou-Taiwan route used to have several Taiwan Navigation Company passenger ships regularly sailing, but now there is only one, the "Taiwan Navigation No. 1," with a carrying capacity of just over a hundred tons. The ship is small and overcrowded, with each trip packed beyond capacity. The only regular ship on the Fuzhou-Xiamen route is the Minjiang Downstream Company's "Yalu River" speedboat, which is also a small steamer of only about a hundred tons. Other northern routes have no regular ships and rely solely on occasional cargo ships taking on a few passengers. In terms of air transport, both the China and Central Aviation Companies have intermediate stations in Fuzhou. The former had opened routes to Shanghai, Xiamen, Hong Kong, and Guangzhou, but recently suspended flights to Fuzhou due to disagreements with the air force station managing the airport. The latter only has one weekly round-trip flight between Shanghai, Fuzhou, Nanchang, and Hankou. Since Fuzhou is an intermediate stop with few flights, seating is limited. Moreover, Fuzhou's Yiyu Airport has no runway and lacks proper airport facilities. In rainy weather, the ground becomes muddy and aircraft cannot land. It is easy to imagine how much convenience this semi-crippled aviation base can provide for air transport. As for land transport: to travel from Fuzhou to Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and Guangdong provinces, one can only rely on dilapidated "old cars" struggling on desolate mountain roads, deterring travelers. With sea, land, and air transport all obstructed, Fuzhou's external transportation is in a state of "isolation," leaving people in Fuzhou with a sense of "suffocation." Many travelers, upon arriving in Fuzhou, are trapped and unable to proceed elsewhere, likening it to a "dead port" or "city of sorrow." The smoothness of transportation depends on the attraction of cargo transport. The current semi-stagnant state is a direct result of the decline in cargo transport due to sluggish production and reduced import and export trade. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's refusal to send large ships to Fuzhou is because there is no cargo to transport and no profit to be made. Other shipping companies are abandoning the Fuzhou route for the same reason. According to transportation industry insiders, ships coming to Fuzhou are not filled with cargo, and too many passengers illegally board without tickets, causing losses to the shipping companies, leading them to avoid the route. If this situation can be improved, Fuzhou's shipping may have a chance to turn around. (Special Correspondent Chen Zhengyu from Fuzhou)

Yuan Guochin, the magistrate of Tainan County, where the mountain is located, has specially dispatched mountain youth representative Tang Shouren and mountain instructor Gao Xieshi to accompany and take care of them. A reporter from this newspaper will also participate. Since the Meteorological Bureau has a dedicated radio station on the mountain peak, maintaining regular contact with the outside world, it is expected that this newspaper may receive telegrams from the highest mountain on the West Pacific coast.

### Taiwan Provincial Government Begins Construction on the Jieshou Hall, But Work Has Not Yet Started

[Taipei Dispatch] The construction project of the Jieshou Hall in Taipei has been underway for more than half a year since it began last year. Although various parties have enthusiastically advocated fundraising for the construction, and a construction project committee has been established to plan the construction, the provincial people have donated generously and actively. However, due to the constant rise in prices, the estimated cost from last year has greatly increased to date, resulting in only drawing and designing for several months, and the construction project has barely started. Recently, due to the difficulty in raising funds, the authorities have cancelled the original proposal and disbanded the project committee. The provincial government has decided to use the site as the provincial government's main office, so that authority and management can be centralized. Chairman Wei is very concerned about this. It is understood that the total cost is approximately 30 million New Taiwan Dollars. The provincial government has now approved an allocation of approximately 20 million New Taiwan Dollars and handed it over to the Taiwan Provincial Public Works Bureau for reconstruction, instructing it to complete the project within one year. The bureau has now begun construction. It is noted that the site was originally the Taiwan Governor-General's Office, which was severely damaged in a massive Allied bombing on May 31, 1945.

[Our Newspaper, Bengbu Dispatch] During the flood season, torrential rains are frequent.

### Kunming Scoundrel Youth Swindles and Deceives: Posing as Minister Wang's Nephew, Scams the Public Office for Two Million Travel Expenses; Police Bureau Investigating the Case

[Our Newspaper, Kunming, 2nd] A case of impersonation and fraud involving a person claiming to be Minister of Industry Wang Shijie's nephew recently occurred in Kunming. A man named Wang Minqian, 28 years old from Hubei, came to Kunming from Kaiyuan. He went to the Special Commissioner's Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, claiming to be Minister Wang's nephew and that he had been robbed on the way, requesting assistance to send him to Shanghai and that his uncle would remit the money back. The office, without suspecting anything, spent a total of 2.2 million yuan. Wang Yumei, the special commissioner of the office, then telegraphed Minister Wang, who replied yesterday: "Received the telegram, do not know this person, please do not provide further assistance, and please investigate if there is any incident of him swindling, and investigate immediately." The office then sent Wang Minqian to the police station. Wang Minqian claimed, "Minister Wang is indeed my uncle, he is not recognizing me now, probably because he is not satisfied with my past behavior." He confessed that he graduated from the Foreign Language Department of Central China University, later served as a translator, and taught at Dali Middle School. He came to Kunming to transfer to Shanghai to find a job and was robbed on the way, so he had to seek help. The police station is currently investigating the case and plans to transfer it to the court.

### Mongolian Banner Queen Qijunfeng and Son Murdered

Our Newspaper Reporter Yang Chang, Baotou Airmail, July 27

On the afternoon of July 20, the news of Qijunfeng's murder spread to Guihua and then throughout the city.

The Ulanqab League's thirteen banners have an average of one bloody political struggle every four years. However, neither faction harms the young ruler; each is willing to hold the young king, hold the Zasak's military seal, and command the chanting lamas, idle Taijis, and "black people" who are always slaves. The simultaneous death of the young ruler and the queen this time shows, on the one hand, that hereditary kings are no longer seen as sacred by the people, and on the other hand, that the political struggle is becoming increasingly tragic. The opposition party is cutting the grass to eliminate future troubles. Because the queen and young ruler of the Western Gong Banner were murdered, the banner has become the current focus of the Suiyuan and Mengjiang situation. Today, the representatives of the Western Gong Banner arrived in Guihua from Baotou, and it is unknown how the situation will develop in the future.

The Western Gong Banner is a small country, belonging to the Urad tribe. The Urad and Sizi tribes, the Right Wing Banner of Khalkha (i.e., Darhan Banner), and the Maoming'an Banner are in an alliance, collectively known as the Ulanqab League. The Urad tribe is divided into three banners: the Former Banner is the Western Gong Banner, the Middle Banner is the Middle Gong Banner, and the Rear Banner is the Eastern Gong Banner. Although the Urad tribe, Sizi tribe, Khalkha tribe, and Maoming'an tribe are all descendants of Genghis Khan, they do not belong to the same branch. Since the establishment of the Republic of China, each banner has been independent and autonomous, and the League Leader is now a figurehead. The National Government and the Provincial Government provide many provisions, ammunition, and funds annually to cultivate troops, run schools, and provide disaster relief to the Mongolian banners unconditionally. The rulers of the Mongolian banners only offer a few pieces of colored silk and war horses, but exchange them with the Provincial Government for the National Government's formal appointment orders for positions such as Zasak, Security Commander, and Eastern and Western Co-Directors. The map of the Western Gong Banner looks like an upside-down Ruyi (scepter), occupying the entire Urad Mountain and half of the Lang Mountain. The plains include the Ming'an River of Da Shetai, the Middle Beach in front of the Urad Mountain, and the banks of the Wu Jia River under the Lang Mountain.

The War of Resistance divided the Western Gong Banner into two parts: the Urad Mountain area east of Anbei became the domain of Ebaoqi, and the Lang Mountain area west of Anbei became the world of Qijunfeng. The essence of the Western Gong Banner is in the Urad Mountain area, not in the Lang Mountain area. Qijunfeng recruited Han Chinese from Houtao and Hao Youlong, the son of Selingbu, and barely organized five or six hundred cavalry, but could not compete with Ebaoqi. Therefore, after the victory, he still requested the Suiyuan Provincial Government to restore Ebaoqi's original position. Although Hao Youlong is young, he seized many weapons from the puppet army and the Communist army by taking advantage of the National Army's surrender in Baotou and the Communist Army's siege of Baotou, forming a force to succeed his father. Because Qijunfeng served as acting Zasak and Security Commander, others could not serve as Zasak and Security Commander. As early as last winter, students from the Western Gong Banner publicly arrested Qijunfeng's most trusted chief of staff and imprisoned him in the Twelfth War Zone Military Law Supervision Department. On the 15th of this month, the Western Gong Banner held a "Chugra" (assembly), and the queen announced the dismissal of Hao Youlong and declared that she would detain Ebaoqi. On the 20th, on the way back to Baotou, she met rebel soldiers disguised as bandits who assassinated her.

Qijunfeng and Qifahe were victims of internal strife in the Mongolian banner. The young king was twelve years old this year, like a flash in the pan. The queen was thirty-three years old this year, and her life was full of tragedy. The queen was the granddaughter of the Alashan Prince and the adopted daughter of the Darlagte Prince's daughter-in-law. Her origins were very noble, but she was ill-fated. Her father, Deyichen, and her elder brother, Luo Jingrui, were killed by the former Tawan and the current Dawan in 1931 and 1934, respectively, for assisting General Feng Yuxiang in the National Revolution. At the age of twelve, she left the Princess Mansion in Dingyuanying and fled to her aunt, Old Lady Qi's house. Her original Chinese name was Luo Yulan, but she was later adopted by her aunt and renamed Qijunfeng. Qijunfeng's national fame during the War of Resistance was entirely due to her aunt's planning. Qijunfeng was not as beautiful as the immortals as portrayed in Chongqing newspapers, but she was solemn and gentle. She could speak fluent Mandarin, which was a characteristic of the Alashan Banner aristocracy. Although she graduated from elementary school, she studied diligently after the death of King Shi and could read newspapers, approve official documents, and give public speeches eloquently. She also wore military uniforms in the bedroom, not only to maintain the dignity of the queen but also to show that she wanted to be a Mongolian female hero. Qijunfeng and King Shi only had one son, and there were many rumors about this. Those who opposed her said that his origins were unknown. The child's Mongolian name was Alatan Oqier, the same name as King A of Hangjin Banner, so he was also called Little King A. The reason why Little King A had his mother's Qi surname was that all direct descendants of Genghis Khan had the Qi surname, and there were over a hundred people with the Qi surname among prominent figures in Suiyuan and Mengjiang. When Little King A was three years old, he shouted "Support the Leader" in front of Chairman Chiang. He was a top student in schools in Shanba and Guihua. Qijunfeng originally planned to govern herself and planned to send Qifa Wu to study in the United States, but he died like a comet in a storm. The Urad Mountain and Lang Mountain of the Western Gong Banner are economic treasures, and internationally they are an eight-hundred-mile-long Great Wall. If the Western Gong Banner allowed Qijunfeng to complete unification within ten years and let Qifa Wu return from the United States to build, it could become a fertile border area with coal, iron, fish, and rice. In short, the murder of Qijunfeng and her son is a loss to the Mongolian banner and a misfortune to the country.

### Autumn Semester is Approaching; Book Shortage in the Province Continues to be Severe

A Small Number of Booksellers Seize the Opportunity to Profit by Charging High Prices

[Dahua News Agency, Nanchang Aerial Dispatch] As the autumn semester approaches, the book shortage in this province is quite serious. A small number of schools here, after receiving notices from Shanghai bookstores, remitted money to Shanghai to order national standard textbooks. The original plan stated that the books would be delivered by the end of July at the latest. However, the deadline has passed without any news. Inquiries made through friends in Shanghai revealed that the publication dates for textbooks for senior primary schools and middle schools are still distant and uncertain, and there are only sample books for junior primary schools, making it impossible to deliver the goods for the time being. In addition to their resentment, the schools have reported all the facts to the administrative authorities for verification, requesting that they forward the matter to the Ministry of Education to order the books to be delivered in full and to issue licenses carefully to prevent the continued occurrence of undelivered orders. Furthermore, the selling price of national standard textbooks here, whether new or revised editions from major publishers such as Commercial Press and World Book Company, is 112 times the listed price. However, in addition to the book shortage, the market situation is quite chaotic. It is reported that some small publishers are seizing the opportunity to raise prices, so schools are asking bookstores to request the Ministry of Education to issue an order announcing a price limit to reduce the burden on students.

The fee standards for private schools in the next semester will be determined by referring to two points: the comparison between the price of rice at the beginning of the spring semester and the current price of rice in August, and the comparison of the increase in the salaries of public school teachers since the last semester. The board of directors of the Private Primary and Secondary School Principals Association will meet on the 15th of this month to discuss this issue and draft fee collection standards.

### Guo Zhen Cup Women's Volleyball; Municipal No. 1 and Youlian Win; Men's Group Jiguang and Huayan B Triumph

Youlian Defeats Aiguang (Women)

Youlian and You team both have hopes of winning the women's championship this year. The match against Aiguang yesterday can be said to have been "solved easily." Chen Meizhen, Zhu Jinhe, Zhu Min, and others all had good performances. Zhu Min's serve was quite fierce. The score in the first game was closer, but in the second game, Aiguang's Chen Xian was disorganized and unable to fulfill his duties, so the opponent went with the flow. Lu Xianchun and Li Muzhen of Aiguang also resisted quite strongly.

Municipal No. 1 Defeats Fuhua (Women)

The female players of Municipal No. 1 Middle School can all jump and hit the ball, and they are brave in spirit. It is not difficult to become a good team. In the first game, Fuhua gave a start with a score of 21 to 10, and it was completed in one go. Who would have expected that in the second game, the players of Municipal No. 1 would be extra united, with Xue Yuehua, Wang Qiman, and others cooperating from front to back, and Xue's spike blocking showed skill. Municipal No. 1 managed to pull back one game. The third game was the decisive key. Municipal No. 1 met the attack with falls, not hesitating to sacrifice. "Heaven did not disappoint those who worked hard." At the last moment, it was still a tie at 19 points. Xue Yuehua served powerfully and increased one point. When Peter served again, back and forth across the net, Fuhua carelessly made a big mistake. Municipal No. 1 actually won 2-1 and cheered.

### Important Battle in the Table Tennis Finals; Jingwu vs. Lianxing Tonight

The 27th act of the Second Table Tennis Finals will be held at the Central Auditorium of Hengbo Bridge at 8:00 PM tonight. Jingwu, the champion of the second division, will face Lianxing, the runner-up of the first division. The referees will be Chen Jimao and Shen Bohong, the inspectors will be Dai Yongquan and Wang Yishan, and the recorders will be Hu Shansheng. Jingwu has won five matches in a row and is invincible. The main player Wang Youxin has not returned from Taiwan, which is of great concern to fans. Generals such as Zhang Xuehui, Ouyang Wei, Yang Kaiyun, and Gao Hongxing are participating in the battle, and their momentum is strong and unparalleled. Lianxing is composed of elites and has emerged as a dark horse, breaking the Mail A, defeating Hualian, and winning the Yuan team. These are all outstanding works. Currently, it has only lost to Huxing once. Tonight, they will face the ever-victorious Jingwu. If they can fight bravely and get rid of arrogance, the victory or defeat is still uncertain. When the two heroes meet, a fierce battle is inevitable. The names of both sides are recorded on the left:

(Jingwu) Han Dehui (captain), Ouyang Wei, Zhang Xuewei, Yang Kaiyun, Gao Hongxing, Chen Zengliang, Shui Hangao, Xu Sunjia, Gu Shenghui.

### Basketball Committee Resolution; Pingguang Protest Rejected; Referee Error Not Absolutely Denied; Obstruction by Players Outside the Court Should Result in Forfeiture

The Standing Committee Meeting of the Basketball Committee of the Municipal Sports Association was held in conjunction with the Municipal Gymnasium at the Jing'an Building Clubhouse at 5:00 PM yesterday. In addition to reporting on the various affairs of the association, several important motions were passed. A summary is as follows:

Report Items: (1) The financial settlement of this year's basketball league and the Mayor's Cup, (2) The process of conducting the basketball theory test competition, (3) The circumstances of the Shanghai competition of the Capital Xiang Team Women's Basketball Team.

Discussion Items: (1) A letter from the Chongqing Qi 16th Regiment basketball team stated that it will come to Shanghai for a competition at the end of October. The resolution was passed.

(2) A letter from the Liangguang Flood Relief Association requested that the association host a charity match and invite the Hualian Oil Team and the Capital and ZhengLun basketball teams to compete in two matches. The resolution was passed and submitted to the Standing Council of the Municipal Sports Association for record.

Resolution: Regarding the point of referee error raised by the team, the letter from the refereeing committee did not absolutely deny it. A rematch could have been granted, but the team's players were unwilling to compete repeatedly during the game, and the players outside the court also invaded the court to obstruct the game's progress. This behavior violated the spirit of sports. The referee's decision to forfeit the game was proper, and the team's protest should be rejected.

(4) A letter from referee Wu requested that Xu Shunfu and Rong Chengen of the Xinsheng team be punished for their improper behavior during the game between the Xinsheng team and the Changshu team. Resolution: Xu Shunfu and Rong Chengen of the Xinsheng team should be warned.

### Large Investors Rush to Buy, Boosting Market Confidence: Shanghai Stocks Experience Weekend Rally; Yongxin Silk Ends High, Mei Ya Also Strong

Shanghai stocks suddenly became popular yesterday.

The rally was strong, further fueled by the momentum of foreign stocks. Major investors, such as numbers 235, Da Kangcheng, and 177, Hexing, became increasingly active buyers. Despite a large volume of actual goods being released, Yongxin Silk managed to close on a high note. Active traders also assisted in buying. Among other stocks, only Xinguang showed some vigor and excitement.

The market opened high. After opening, Yongxin Silk rose from 231 yuan. Purchased by numbers 154, 117, 94, 142, 231, 68, 116, 103, 223, and 224, the price was gradually pushed up.

Number 120, Gaoshan Youguang, opened at around 25 million yuan, reaching a high of 5.2 million yuan at the close. In the afternoon, due to a lack of interest, the price was slightly lowered, with the final price being 4.8 million yuan.

### Yarn Prices Retrace Near the Close

Yesterday's cotton yarn market saw increased absorption by customers from the Yangtze River region at the opening. Although it was a Saturday, credit remained loose, and transactions were quite numerous, leading to a rising market. However, as private factories released goods near the close and scattered investors heard the news and rushed to sell, confidence suddenly waned, and prices retraced. As a result, 42-count Blue Phoenix yarn was at 17.15 million yuan, down 100,000 yuan from the previous day. 20-count Double Horse yarn rose slightly by 50,000 yuan to 10.9 million yuan.

### First Batch of 100 Tons of Taiwan Sugar Shipped to Singapore

[Central News Agency, Taipei, 2nd] 100 tons of Taiwan sugar were shipped from Kaohsiung Port to Singapore for sale last month, marking the first time Taiwan sugar has entered the international market after the war. According to the Taiwan Sugar Corporation: "The second batch of 200 tons of sugar has been stored in Kaohsiung Port and will soon be shipped to Singapore by British ships." Since the Dutch East Indies have been mired in long-term war, the Javanese sugar industry has been in decline. The sugar needed by various Southeast Asian regions now also relies on Taiwan. However, Taiwan sugar is still in the restoration period. At the same time, there is a great need for sugar in mainland China. The 300 tons of sugar mentioned above are only for trial sales and are obviously difficult to supply the needs of Southeast Asia in large quantities. As for the shipment of 50,000 tons of Taiwan sugar to Japan, the company said: "The price issue has not yet been agreed upon, and there is no definite date for shipment." It is also heard that the so-called price issue is that the Taiwan Sugar Corporation believes that it should cover costs, while MacArthur's headquarters believes that the selling price is too high, which has not been resolved.

### Export Promotion Committee Approves New Tea Purchase Method in Principle; Detailed Implementation Method to Be Studied by Subcommittee

In addition, tea experts will be invited to jointly discuss the method. It is heard that the subcommittee is scheduled to meet at 3:00 PM tomorrow to discuss and formulate a method, which will be submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval before implementation.

Farmers Bank Handles Boxed Tea Collateral

For 1946 boxed tea that has expired and has not been redeemed or applied for purchase by the China Trust Bureau, the Farmers Bank will handle the collateral in accordance with the decision of the Four Joint Offices and purchase it on behalf of the China Trust Bureau. According to the bank's published statistics on the handling of collateral, there are five types of boxed tea, totaling 58,894 boxes: (1) Qihong 15,049 boxes, (2) Tunlv 186 boxes, (3) Pinglv 42,958 boxes, (4) Wenhong 313 boxes, (5) Wanglv 388 boxes. The collateral amount is more than 13 billion.

New Qi Red Tea Difficult to Sell

The new Qi Red Tea from Qimen, which has been in Shanghai for a long time this year, has seen continuous negotiations.

Other varieties are still being inquired about by local stores and customers, especially low-grade old red tea. The opening prices are consistently firm. As for the foreign tea market, both imports and exports remain rare, and the process is extraordinarily quiet.

### CITC Establishes Taiwan Branch to Facilitate Material Exchange with Taiwan Province

In order to develop its business and facilitate the exchange of materials between Taiwan Province and foreign countries, the China Import and Export Trust Corporation (CITC) has established a branch in Taiwan and appointed Zhou Shaozeng as manager. Zhou recently went to Taiwan under orders, visited Chairman Wei, contacted relevant agencies, and has returned to Shanghai to report the process to the head office. According to him: After the restoration of Taiwan Province, all production industries urgently need to develop and urgently need to import machinery, raw materials, seeds, and other items, and export various products. The CITC head office previously established an office in the province to handle the export and import of important materials. Now, in order to strengthen development, a branch has been established in Taiwan. In the future, the main business will be to handle the import and export of materials and barter trade with foreign countries in accordance with laws and regulations, and will also handle commissioned purchases of materials and property insurance and life insurance for public and private institutions to assist the government in promoting economic construction.

### Soap Supply Exceeds Demand, Prices Fall

Yesterday's soap market saw a decline in prices due to the upcoming distribution of Guguben soap at a price of 460,000 yuan per box, which made buyers hesitant. In addition, Huang Xiangmao soap was still being resold, and the supply in the market exceeded demand. Finally, Guguben soap fell to 473,000 yuan per box, down 7,000 yuan from the previous day. Arrow Knife soap also fell by 5,000 yuan to 470,000 yuan. The prices of other soaps such as Xiangmao, Guanghua, and Riyue also fell by varying amounts, from 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Matches and kerosene remained stable.

### Cigarette Industry Submits Five Suggestions to the Import Control Committee to Obtain Foreign Exchange

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Shanghai Cigarette Industry Association recently sent a letter to the Import Control Committee regarding the issue of foreign exchange allocation for tobacco leaves. The letter stated: In the past two allocations of foreign exchange for tobacco leaves, the committee assigned import firms to purchase tobacco leaves. These import firms should legally supply the various cigarette factories for reasonable orders. However, according to the association, since the previous foreign exchange allocations, few of its member cigarette factories have received reasonable orders. The remaining foreign exchange has been freely disposed of by the import firms or resold by tobacco leaf intermediaries, greatly increasing the selling price of American leaves. The following suggestions are now made for adoption: The suggestions, totaling five items, were decided at the association's recent standing council meeting and are roughly as follows: (1) Please provide the Import Control Committee with records of previous tobacco leaf foreign exchange allocations, including (A) the names of the import firms and the amount of foreign exchange allocated to each; (B) the names of the cigarette factories to which each import firm sold, the amount of foreign exchange, and the transaction price of the tobacco leaves sold. (2) From the third phase onwards, please instruct the import firms to submit the purchase contracts to the association for endorsement before submitting them to the committee for foreign exchange allocation. If there is no endorsement from the association, allocation will not be granted. (3) In the future, foreign exchange allocations for tobacco leaves should be limited to import firms with a history before the war and experience in the tobacco leaf business. (4) Foreign quotas must have rigid proportional regulations when allocating foreign exchange. For example, in the first and second phases of foreign exchange allocation for paper circles, Shanghai cigarette factories received 5/6, and foreign cigarette factories received 1/6. When estimating foreign exchange for tobacco leaves, because the quality of cigarettes produced in foreign factories is lower and requires less American leaves, the proportion can be determined lower. (5) If import firms attempt to make excessive profits when determining prices based on available foreign exchange and manufacturing plants are unwilling to order from them, the import firms' foreign exchange quota should be canceled immediately and reallocated to other import firms.

### Industrial Raw Material Distribution Problems: Various Industrial Trade Associations Attach Great Importance To It; Pan Shih-hao Says Commerce and Industry Should Not Have Friction

Over forty units of various industrial trade associations in this city have compiled a summary of information regarding the distribution of industrial raw materials under import quotas. They are scheduled to send representatives to Beijing on Wednesday to appeal to relevant central authorities. Today (i.e., the 3rd) at 3:00 PM, they will convene a gathering at the Xing Wu Restaurant in the Cishu Building on Nanjing Road, inviting industrial leaders and prominent figures from the press to exchange views and report on developments over the past three months. It is said that the publicly released materials will point out the mistakes of the distribution office, the misunderstandings of the commercial associations, and the excessive concerns of the import industry. During the intervening period, the distribution office ostensibly waited for agreement, but was genuinely open. As a result, the industrial sector believed there was sufficient reason for confidence, while the commercial and import sectors had their own regrets. According to Mr. Pan Shih-hao, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Industrial Association, in order to seek a rational distribution of industrial raw materials, consulted with the allocation office of the Import and Export Control Commission to seek coordination among various industries. Due to the favorable exchange rate settlement, they hoped that the distribution of industrial raw materials could assist the industrial sector. For the commercial sector, they planned to allocate quotas as appropriate for coordination. As for importers, they respected their position as intermediaries. The establishment of the Import Quota Industrial Raw Materials Distribution Review Committee was composed of ten directors each from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Industrial Association. When meetings were held, importers and relevant commercial associations were invited to send representatives to attend, with the intention of avoiding friction among the industrial, commercial, and import sectors. In the end, the authorities only managed to distribute quotas to importers. The large proportions between industry and commerce, except for cotton, wool, tobacco, pulp, and rubber, which are relatively simple in nature and designated to be directly acquired by industry, those with more complex relationships, such as chemical raw materials, dyes, and hardware, have not yet been divided in large quantities. As a result, the heads of the associations cannot help but plan for the members of their own associations, and commercial and industrial agreements have failed. The first quarter quota, when the review committee failed to reach an agreement, was obtained by those who were quick to act. This is inconsistent with national policies and commercial ethics. I advocate that industrial raw materials should be obtained by industry, and if industry and commerce encounter imported goods that should be distributed, the government should clearly specify the proportions to ensure fairness and avoid friction, he said. Mr. Shen also pointed out that legitimate and reasonable importers must have their value of existence and have meaning beneficial to international trade. The industrial sector has never completely denied that.

Fir Wood Stagnation

The market price of fir wood is still difficult to boost, stagnating at 600 yuan. The market price of foreign pine is also stagnant. Due to the stability of general timber prices for many days, it is difficult to decline. If not subject to unexpected stimulation, it will likely hover for many days.

Legal Interpretation

A Traitor Who Acted as an Accomplice to the Enemy During the War of Resistance Plans to Apply for Parole

Editor: A friend, Mr. Jia, was detained in 1945 after the victory for the crime of being a traitor. In April 1946, he was sentenced to two years and six months of imprisonment by the court. The time since his detention has exceeded one year and two months, and he now intends to apply for parole. There are three legal questions, and I pray for answers. (1) According to the provisions of Article 77, Paragraph 1, Proviso of the Criminal Law, this shall not apply to those whose execution of fixed-term imprisonment is less than one year. Now that Mr. Jia has been detained for more than one year, should the detention time be deducted, or should he be able to apply only after another year from the date of the judgment? (2) According to the provisions of Paragraph 2 of the same article, "If the execution period in the preceding paragraph encounters the situation in Article 46, it shall be calculated based on the remaining term of imprisonment." Does the so-called "remaining term of imprisonment" refer to the remaining term of imprisonment at the time of the judgment? Now that Jia has been sentenced to two years and six months, deducting the one year and two months of detention, should he serve half of the remaining term of imprisonment, that is, eight months, before he can be paroled? (3) In summary, what procedures should Mr. Jia use to apply for parole? Sincerely, Shen Junke

[Answer from Lawyer Jiang Pingfan] (1) The provisions of Article 77, Paragraph 1, Proviso of the Criminal Law, "This shall not apply to those whose execution of fixed-term imprisonment is less than one year," refer to the fact that this situation cannot be applied for parole. Jia has been sentenced to two years and six months of imprisonment by the court, so this proviso does not apply. (2) The parole term should be calculated from the date of the judgment. (3) Jia's situation should be executed from the date of the judgment. After one-half of the remaining term has been served, the prison director can submit it to the highest judicial administrative authority for permission for parole.

Chronicle

### Mei Baek-ki Anniversary Ceremony

— You Ting

——『Smart children are often thin, and beautiful daughters are prone to aging.』

For the same reason, great musical geniuses are also prone to die young: Beethoven was deaf at the age of 32, half of his genius was destroyed, Mozart, as well as China's Huang Zi, Xian Xinghai, and Nie Er, were all short-lived geniuses, with such rich musical wisdom, they passed away in middle age.

On this day last year (August 3, 1946), Shanghai lost a Far Eastern musical master. He came to Shanghai in the year the First World War ended and has been serving Shanghai's musical culture ever since. He made many people in Shanghai have the habit of going to concerts, and he had a good influence on many emerging musicians and music school students in Shanghai. Today, the only symphony orchestra in Shanghai is the result of this musical master's efforts for more than 20 years.

This musician who has already returned to another world is Mr. Mei Baek-ki (Maestro Mario Pace), who is most familiar to Shanghai music listeners. He was the bald old conductor who occasionally appeared at the symphony concerts in the Lyceum Theatre after the fall of the Shanghai Concession and was warmly welcomed by the masses. (At that time, Mr. Mei had given up his position as conductor due to the Japanese forced to host the symphony orchestra, just like Toscanini, who refused to cooperate with the fascists and left.)

Although he was not a short-lived genius (he died at the age of 68), in Shanghai, where musical food is so scarce, he did not have the opportunity to give us more artistic achievements, which is regrettable and regrettable!

In 1878, he was born in Italy. At the age of seven, he began to learn piano in a famous musical school, and he began to perform publicly at the age of eleven. This is not surprising in Italy, the land of music, but such precocious success shows his future in any case. However, his father opposed him dedicating himself entirely to music. This is the same difficult experience as many famous musicians.

Therefore, Mei Baek-ki complained in his "Autobiography":

『At the age of fourteen, one day, I sold all my books and only valuables—an old large watch, got some lire (Italian currency), and escaped from Napoli to Rome.』

Going to Rome was to visit Professor Sgambati, one of the last students of Liszt, a famous pianist. He visited the professor, but was blocked by the servant: "The professor does not want to see anyone without a letter of introduction."

After countless blows in Rome, the lonely and poor young Mei Baek-ki finally won the Liszt Prize in the international music competition in 1895.

Soon, with the appreciation of the modern opera composer Puccini (Prcini) and the influence of the modern conductor Toscanini, his skills improved rapidly. His unrestrained personality made him uneasy with "quiet". In 1902, he decided to travel around the world, and at the end of 1918, he arrived in Shanghai. Unexpectedly, the disease kept him here. The following year, he became the conductor of the Shanghai Municipal Council Orchestra, and the orchestra was enriched as a result. Under his strict training and management, the achievements of the orchestra over the past 20 years have been praised by Chinese and foreigners alike. Last year, the municipal symphony orchestra held a memorial concert for Mei Baek-ki. Many enthusiastic listeners missed Mr. Mei's skills and achievements, and tears welled up in their eyes. Several famous musicians who played also showed their inner pain. I will never forget this!

The easiest thing to make people think and chew carefully is Mei's difficult experience, and what Shanghai music listeners yearn for most is his management of the orchestra's affairs and his supervision of skills. This is what friends in the music industry will never forget.

Today, the orchestra is managed by the Conservatory of Music and conducted by Professor Fu Hua. Although the number of performers has decreased a little, we believe that it will definitely be able to inherit the previous achievements and glory!

### Mei Baek-ki's Posture of Conducting the Orchestra

Brother Xian Ou painted a picture for the monthly magazine "Free Talk" edited by Yu, saying "Waiting for the River to Clear" A zhangren (wife's father) leaned on a cane to face the river and wrote this poem to thank him Lü Baihua

Beautiful is this magnificent appearance, It has not been cleared for thousands of years, If an inch of glue can be used to manage it, A smile is not light, Vainly waiting hurts people's lives, Competing currents confuse the world's soldiers, The滔滔(boundless) affairs of the past and present, Leaning on a cane, it is difficult to calm down!

### Two Poems on Zhou Huaimin's Paintings

— Zhang Daqian

One

Spring clouds are so beautiful, Spring water and moon are tinkling, Dragonflies flutter up and down, Idly chasing the fishing line in the wind.

Two

Two guests go to find poetry, Beautiful sentences suddenly fill the scroll; The setting sun fades on the western mountain, I don't realize it's late on the way home.

### A Gift to Painter Zhou Huaimin

— Yang Pingmiao

Yunlin's style originated from the same hometown, Wandering the world, but heartbroken; A painting of the west wind rustling, Everyone says Zhou Lutang. (Huaimin is good at painting Lutang, people at that time called him Zhou Lutang)

### Painting Techniques

— Lu Danlin

When a national painter completes a painting, they often inscribe a title or add poems and prose to the painting. This is called inscription. Originally, painters of the Tang and Song dynasties did not pay much attention to inscription. Some paintings only have a name written in the trees and stones or in the gaps, or even absolutely no name; adding poems and words is even more out of the question. However, later some painters who were good at poetry and prose, especially literati painters, after completing a painting, not only took the title of the day, but also added some poems and prose to set off the meaning of the day. Therefore, later some buyers of paintings actually used the number of inscriptions (including those inscribed by others) to determine the price of the painting, or even its authenticity. Therefore, in recent years, in order to meet the requirements of determining the price of paintings, painters have even included "add five for long inscriptions" in the price list.

Not every painter can create painting titles. Therefore, "Three Friends of Winter", "Dry Wood, Bamboo, and Stone", "Mountain Dwelling Talking", "Autumn Mountain Red Trees", "Layered Peaks and Verdant", "Listening to Pine and Watching Waterfall", "Wealthy and Auspicious Goat", "Lone Fishing in Cold River", "Carrying Qin and Visiting Friends", "Monks Returning Deep in White Clouds", etc. are very common. And the poems and words added are often not newly created by the painter because of the painting, but are copied and used repeatedly. In order to supply and demand, speculative booksellers have even compiled ancient and modern painting poems, categorized and printed them into volumes, to provide those who cannot write poetry with a secret treasure for painting on demand.

Inscription should be precise and appropriate in lightness, not persistent and able to harmonize with the painting materials, and it should also express the author's identity. The title should not contain vulgar elements. I have seen a painter who works in a certain institution paint a painting for his superior, and the inscription is: "× Public Shangshu (Secretary of State) Master Famouly Painted under supervision, subordinate ××× respectfully painted, respectfully seeking grace". Such 背辭(reciting phrases), is equivalent to submitting a formal document, leaving the scope of art. Moreover, taking the Minister of the Republic of China as the Shangshu of the Manchu Qing Dynasty, the times are upside down, which is even more ridiculous. There is also a painter who made a landscape painting and actually inscribed: "The sound of machines and the moon in Meidian, the traces of dogs and the frost on the small bridge", with wrong words everywhere, he should be spanked. There is also a female painter who wrote a plum blossom branch and inscribed: "Occasionally learn Yunlin's stone method, so admire Yu Ke's new style. A piece of green and lush color, actually two 斜　". Using bamboo and stone titles for plum blossoms is really like putting a horse's head to a donkey's mouth. Nothing else, not seeking thorough understanding, thinking about expressing the three excellences of Qingcai, so that Zhang Guan Li Dai has this loss.

Qiu Shizhou was good at painting but not good at poetry. He was self-aware. Most of his paintings were signed with simple titles such as Qiu Yingzhi or Qiu Ying Shifu Hua, and sometimes he added the year and year only. Everyone has their own abilities and inabilities. They should give full play to their strengths and hide their weaknesses. Those who are good at painting do not need to be good at poetry, just as poets do not need to know how to paint. Poetry is already an independent art. If painters cannot recite, why should they squeeze into the ranks of poets? If you don't consider your virtue or ability, and you force yourself to make a rhyme and inscribe it, it will not only be useless, but also harmful.

The ancient masters of inscription often had superb artistic conception. For example, Shitao inscribed a painting axis of plum, stone, and daffodils, saying: "The two gentlemen have the same posture and rhyme, and they are released at the same time, and they are suitable for water. Although Jiangsha pots and stones, chanting and appreciation may be different, a kind of clear fragrance and distant rhyme, far out of the dust, is called a double wall, why be ashamed. Today's people in social interactions often talk about臭味(common interests), alas, how many people can be so飘然标映(outstanding)! This is using the day to talk about life, the meaning is profound, and completely out of the 頭巾氣(pedantry). Jin Dongxin inscribed ink bamboo, saying: "I paint bamboo without painting stones, what is difficult with stones? The color is too ancient, and the snow is used as a feibai, which is good. If you accumulate moss with rain dots, you are not willing to paint it. Painting bamboo is suitable for fatigue, thin and long-lived, and naturally full of wind and frost. Meng Zhuang's ten-circumference bloated tree, I feel lazy to face the drawings, I am afraid that the guests will ridicule me, because I am a meat-eating phase." Using humorous words to explain the principle of painting bamboo and stones is by no means something that people who are ignorant can imitate.

Also, when asking someone to inscribe a poem on a painting, you should consider whether that person can inscribe the painting, because some people who are good at poetry and prose cannot inscribe the painting, so there should be necessary deliberation and selection. Otherwise, a good painting will be inscribed incorrectly, which will detract from the color of the entire painting, and leave a bad impression on the viewers. Putting feces on the Buddha's head is counterproductive. However, the subtleties in it are not easy to explain in detail. Insiders can tell at a glance. Moreover, because of the people who inscribe the paintings and poems, you can also know the relationship between the painters or collectors in the literary and artistic circles. At the same time, you can also know the level of their own choice in the literary and artistic circles. Insiders and outsiders are also distinguished here.

In my opinion, the year of inscription should adopt the Republic of China era, which is suitable for the times. Ye Xia'an has already implemented this point, which is worthy of admiration.

### Cubist Painting

— Liu Shi

Cubism appeared in the history of painting in the 20th century, already 20 or 30 years ago. So Cubism has become a kind of classic, and it is really an interesting thing to start studying it again now.

What I want to talk about here is, what kind of achievements does Cubism have in the history of modern painting? At the same time, I will introduce several writers who are in a leading position in Cubism.

Generally, the origin of Cubism is considered to be Paul Cezanne. This view is naturally not wrong. However, this is only a driving force for the occurrence of Cubism, and it cannot be considered as the origin. Because Cubism is not only an experiment in painting that George Braque first accepted Cezanne's theory, but P. Picasso is a writer who is a precursor. That is to say, Picasso himself has evidence of elements other than Cezanne. He accidentally studied black sculptures and discovered a principle of modeling, and applied the black modeling expression method; therefore, when it comes to the origin of Cubism, on the one hand, it is true that it cannot be ignored that it was inspired by Cezanne's works, and on the other hand, it was greatly influenced by black art, which is more appropriate.

In 1908, this kind of work began to be presented at the Paris Modern Art Exhibition. Braque's cubic expression starting from Cezanne appeared, and Picasso's cubic description learned from black sculptures was also published. At that time, H. Matisse, who saw this cubic style of painting, mocked and said: "Cubist painting! The more you play, the more novel it becomes." Unexpectedly, the Cubist movement has since swept across Paris and even Europe.

After that, they exhibited in various places as a declaration of the Cubist movement to foreigners. At that time, in the preface of the great critic He Bolinai in the publication attached to the exhibition, the title (Cubisme et Cubiste) has been used.

The novel Cubist movement has concentrated the strong attention of people in the new era, and at the same time, it has been greatly oppressed by the old feudal writers. In short, the success of the Cubist movement as a revolutionary of world painting should be attributed to the cooperation and efforts of Braque and Picasso.

Here, I will try to give a brief account of the recent art of Braque, and at the same time discuss the achievements of Cubism in modern painting:

Observing the situation when Cubism started, its object is to explore the outside world, but it is only transforming the form of objects. That is, in the era when it accepted the influence of Cezanneism and black art, Cubism once adopted a cubic deformation description method. Then, with the deepening of research, although the analysis of natural objects is carried out, it gradually deviates from natural objects and seeks objects on the screen itself. At this time, it is no longer about handling the lifelikeness of natural products, but the screen itself is being researched as an object. Therefore, we call it "screen object".

This attitude is to make painting the purest thing. Painting should start from the entire book surface and continue with the composition of the screen. This method, at least, can be said to have been discovered by Braque and gradually purified. Therefore, Braque's cubic expression, which started from Cezanneism, gradually deviated from the initial deformation description and progressed to the formation of theatrical scenes.

After 1930, Braque can be said to be pursuing this kind of composition on the screen to the extreme. And this so-called composition problem in painting has become a central problem in modern painting.

### An Inch of Land, an Inch of Blood 364

— Ye Jingfeng

"Enough!" I was getting annoyed by his rambling.

"I just overheard this while passing by the 'Temporary Office': I heard someone was inquiring about 'Pingming the Monk,' asking why he hadn't registered..." The big fool stopped there, his gaze already shifting to Dingyuan.

I was somewhat baffled, but then I saw Dingyuan already standing up, a wry smile on his face. "I need to go take a walk and come back. If I don't, I'm afraid those bastards might cause trouble and even come here." As he spoke, he picked up his monk's robes and the odds and ends.

Only then did I realize that Dingyuan had taken the name "Pingming" here, but he had to go register every day. The short devils treated him like a "semi-free prisoner," showing how difficult and dangerous his situation was. He probably didn't even know it himself. Seeing him about to leave, and not knowing the actual situation, I didn't want to insist he stay. Suddenly, I remembered the food the big fool had bought, so I immediately gestured for the big fool to open the package.

"It's alright," Dingyuan said to me, knowing I wanted him to eat before leaving. "I still have rations on my side, and I'll be back in an hour at most. Save some of the good stuff for me..." As he spoke, he was already dressed and ready, raising his hand to us in farewell, dragging his heavy steps, swaying as he walked out the door.

The big fool was surprisingly capable. Once the package was opened, inside, besides the food, were cups, plates, chopsticks, and dishes. Among the food were two large braised chickens, twenty or thirty tall steamed buns, many braised eggs, a thermos bottle, probably filled with boiled water, a bottle of wine, and several aged, wrinkled pears.

While eating this spring picnic-style lunch, I finished the story of Tsurumi. I didn't hold back the fact that Tsurumi was being recalled to Tokyo for training. I also explained the top-secret message received last night from Tokyo, which instructed us to prepare to go to , all were explained. I also told Yaoqun and Little Tiger that W. and I had been extremely anxious since receiving their first report, and that W. had specifically sent me to Tianjin. Upon receiving the second report, he had told me to abandon the rescue work I had started in Tianjin and rush here, preparing to risk my life to sneak across the "no man's land" of Nankou and go to Zhangbei to search for their traces. Fortunately, they were still lingering here, and fortunately, we had met again. It could be said that it was half human effort, half luck. I felt immense joy, and W. and Tokyo were undoubtedly relieved after receiving the telegram I had just sent.

"It's all a delay in the telegram!" Yaoqun said, tears in his eyes but a smile on his face. "Just one less communication tool, and no reliable personnel for transportation; it just so happened..." Yaoqun stopped there, glancing at Little Tiger again. "Tiger brother got separated again, otherwise..."

Upon hearing this, Little Tiger's whole body trembled, as if suddenly electrocuted. I couldn't help but laugh. Little Tiger was even more embarrassed when he saw me laughing. I thought about Little Tiger's two reports and his eccentric temperament. After arriving in Beiping, I don't know why he refused to report to headquarters in person. Sneaking around, he produced that slanted "official document" and then ran off here in a puff of smoke. If Yaoqun knew about this, he would scold him severely. I thought Little Tiger definitely wouldn't want me to burst that bubble, so I let it go with a laugh.

### Heatwave Strikes Shanghai

— Haifeng

On July 27th, the temperature in Shanghai reached 99.9 degrees. According to the records of the Central Meteorological Observatory, it reached 104 degrees on July 12th, 1934, so this was far from the hottest weather. The average temperature for the past 73 years is 94.8 degrees, and 99.9 degrees has already broken the highest record of the average Shanghai temperature in 73 years.

Shanghai has been in a heatwave for the past week, and the heatwave has not receded. Although there have been several thunderstorms to wash it away, the intensity has not decreased.

From July 23rd to the 31st, the temperature records in Shanghai are: 23rd: 98.5 degrees, 24th: 98.9 degrees, 25th: 96.4 degrees, 26th: 90 degrees, 27th: 99.9 degrees, 28th: 99 degrees, 29th: 99.8 degrees, 30th: 93 degrees, 31st: 98.8 degrees.

The difference in temperature between these nine days is at most five degrees, and the average temperature is around 98 degrees, which shows that Shanghai has been hit by a heatwave.

According to the Meteorological Observatory, the reason why Shanghai is so hot this year is because the humid and hot air from the North Pacific and the dry and hot air from southwestern China are covering it. Although local thunderstorms are prone to occur, the heatwave will not decrease after the rain, and the hot period will not be too short.

The day before yesterday, everyone had another new hope for the weather, that is, the typhoon would land along the coast of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, and it was expected that Shanghai would be hit by this typhoon around July 31st or August 1st. If the typhoon washes over, the weather may be much cooler, but the Meteorological Observatory announced on the 30th that this typhoon had moved northeast to southern Japan on the afternoon of the 30th, with a small and weak wind rate of only 25 to 30 miles per hour. Therefore, this typhoon has formed a temperate storm, and its activity will disappear after it reaches land.

In other words, Shanghai will no longer be affected by any typhoons.

If you want to make a judgment on the weather in August, then-: the weather in Shanghai will be even hotter, and it will not be cool for a while.

### Curing Insomnia

— Dongfang Jing

Do you still remember that sleepless night, tossing and turning, unable to fall asleep? Maybe you regret eating a bowl of wontons before going to bed, or regret taking a nap during the day, which hindered normal sleep.

But you are wrong. Professor Nathaniel Kleitman of the University of Chicago, with 25 years of experience in studying sleep problems, knows that how much you eat for dinner, a snack before bed, or a nap during the day has no adverse effect on nighttime sleep.

Professor Kleitman, hailed as the person who knows the most about sleep problems in the world, is 52 years old, with a head of black hair, and is also the only person in the world who works 24 hours a day. After he goes to bed, his research work does not stop. His bed is equipped with a set of sensitive recording instruments that record his heartbeat, breathing, brainwave activity, and body movements during sleep.

Professor Kleitman's research achievements over the past 25 years have broken the common misconceptions about sleep.

For example, ordinary people think that everyone should have eight hours of sleep every day. Professor Kleitman's research results show that the amount of sleep needed by each person is different. Some people have to sleep for nine hours, but for some people, five hours is enough.

In Professor Kleitman's experiments, he himself had not slept for 180 consecutive hours. Apart from a decrease in work efficiency, there were no permanent adverse reactions.

People always toss and turn while sleeping. This kind of turning only makes people sleep more soundly. Someone once warned not to sleep on the left side, but it doesn't matter which side you sleep on, because you have to turn at least a dozen times in one night.

Ordinary people feel that they should not eat before going to bed. In fact, after many experiments, eating a sandwich or drinking milk before going to bed has no effect on sleep. As for drinking coffee, Professor Kleitman has three answers. First, many people drink coffee before going to bed and can still sleep well. Second, some people are stimulated by coffee and do not sleep well. The third type of person, they just think in their hearts that they are stimulated by coffee and cannot fall asleep. The reason why they think this way is because they have repeatedly heard people say this.

What is sleep? Professor Kleitman's answer is very simple. He said: "Sleep is everyone's routine, repeated every 24 hours. Because people can't stay awake all the time without sleeping."

An infant wakes up only because he feels too cold or too hot, or the diaper is wet, or he is hungry. Once he is fed. After changing the diaper and feeling comfortable, he falls asleep again. Gradually growing up, he develops the habit of working and playing during the day and sleeping at night.

There is no one-size-fits-all method for treating insomnia. Some people need a little exercise before going to bed, some need to take a hot bath, some need records to hypnotize them, and some need to count numbers or recite the names of the capitals of the world. You should use whichever method works for you. But never take sleeping pills.

According to Professor Kleitman's experiments, to sleep soundly, it is best to go to bed at a fixed time every night and not often be uncertain. At the same time, don't be nervous before going to bed. If you don't sleep well, go to bed earlier. Because people who go to bed early sleep longer and sleep better.

### Customs After Marriage in Europe and America

— Dongfang Mengwu

In Europe and the United States, it is customary to send out invitations to guests for a feast on the same day of the same month of the second year after the wedding, to celebrate the event. For example, the silver wedding of the former British Emperor Edward was once widely circulated. In recent decades, those "the moon is better abroad" people in our country have also followed suit. However, most of them may only know the two wedding customs of gold and silver weddings. The rest may not have heard of it. Here, I will record what I know and publish it for the "chasing foreigners" celebrities and elegant scholars to imitate one by one, so that there will be no more regrets of "pearls left behind in the sea":

The first year is "cotton";

The second year is "paper";

The third year is "leather";

The fifth year is "wood";

The seventh year is "wool";

The tenth year is "tin";

The twelfth is "silk" or "linen";

The fifteenth is "crystal";

The twentieth is "porcelain";

The twenty-fifth year is "silver";

The thirtieth year is "pearl";

The fortieth year is "gem";

The fiftieth year is "gold";

The seventy-fifth year is "diamond".

From cotton to crystal to gold and diamond! - It should be taken to mean that the couple can be of one heart after marriage, and the older they get, the stronger and longer they last.

Prostitute Training Class

The Changsha Municipal Police Department gathered more than two hundred prostitutes in the city and gave them military management and reconnaissance training at the Guangming Grand Theater every morning, and instilled common sense of hygiene. The prostitutes who knew a little about it had a good understanding of the cultivation of this technique. This first prostitute training class has been completed. On the morning of the 25th of last month, a graduation certificate awarding ceremony was held at the Keyuan Lvping Shuchang in the city. The heads of various agencies were invited to perform speeches to show encouragement.

Supplements to the Hunan Disaster

The disaster in Hunan Province is terrible. The villagers take their families to wander around and have no means of living. They sell their wives and children to make a living. On the streets of Lingling County, a villager sold two sons. The price of the older son was three buckets of white rice, and the price of the younger son was two buckets of white rice. Also, in the Yangyang city, a strong man took his wife to sell. A passer-by "traded" for 20,000 yuan in legal tender. However, it was discovered that the woman still had an infant less than two months old. The strong man insisted on selling them together. In desperation, Xingba added 3,000 yuan to buy the infant together.

Unofficial History of Grain Collection

The Sichuan Provincial Grain Administration recently received a report from the grain collection personnel of the four counties of Qiongzui, Dase, Pujiang, and Pengshan, saying that the township chiefs of these four counties embezzled as much as 30,000 to 40,000 shi of grain, and the least was also more than several thousand shi. This batch of Zheng Township Chiefs colluded with local bullies, and their momentum was huge. Before the grain supervision group arrived, they intimidated them. After they arrived, they set up machine guns all over the streets and alleys to show their "welcome", trying to prevent the clearing of grain from previous years. The township chiefs had already avoided seeing them, so the grain collection personnel had no way to contact them, let alone clear the grain.

Seven-Year-Old Addict

The Taiyuan Police Department arrested a petty thief named Wang Gensheng on the 20th of last month.

Trouble Caused by Watching a Play (Guangxu 22nd Year, December 26th)

On the 27th of last month, a misunderstanding occurred between the police and military police in front of the Jindu Grand Theater, causing a conflict. They pointed guns at each other, as if facing a great enemy. Fifty years ago, incidents also occurred in Shanghai theaters where soldiers caused trouble, had verbal altercations with the audience, and even beat people to death.

"Recently, the Sha Ning boats in Nanshi have hired opera students from the Liyuan in Hubai to perform together at the Nanhui Hall. There are crowds of spectators. Although the patrol bureau has sent soldiers to suppress them, there are still inevitable quarrels. The day before yesterday, in the midst of loud gongs and drums, someone from a certain foundry had a verbal altercation with a soldier from a certain camp over a dispute over seats. They disagreed and twisted and beat each other. At that time, there were many soldiers, so the people from the foundry were defeated and suffered heavy losses. They then sent someone back to the foundry to gather sixty or seventy people to question them and block the way outside the hall. They beat people when they saw them, so the soldiers were unable to resist and suffered losses instead. Four soldiers were seriously injured. Someone then went to the camp to report. The camp official ordered the injured soldiers to be carried to the Yuanlai foundry. It was a lot of chaos, and I don't know how it will end."

The Vulgar and Boring "Peach Blossoms Still Smile in the Spring Breeze"

"Peach Blossoms Still Smile in the Spring Breeze" attempts to use the theme of comedy to express the free love and married life of young men and women, but the two main characters, Zhang Ping and Du Shafei, who appear in the story, the former is a frivolous and boring young man, and the latter is just a broad-minded young lady who inexplicably gets angry. The two people are put together by the director in a nonsensical way to perform this "comedy" story. This script is vulgar and boring enough.

Chen Juanjuan's first time acting in such a play, the results are still somewhat satisfactory. When Bai Yun's Zhang Ping appears on the film, wearing a floral tie, a floral suit, and an airplane head, he is a complete rascal, and his twisted state is disgusting. Wang Ban has no chance to perform in the play.

The director's handling of the play is loose and disorganized.

Comedy Film "Champagne Lovebirds"

Also a comedy film, "Champagne Lovebirds" has its success. The whole play connects the whole story with a bottle of champagne. Naturally, a love story is also inserted in the middle, but the screenwriter's skills are commendable. He allows this bottle of champagne to be obtained and lost several times, writing in a meticulous and humorous way. The audience's emotions always shift with the bottle of champagne until the champagne is thrown towards the newly launched aircraft carrier, and only then is it easily satisfied. This cannot but be said to be the success of this play.

Among the actors, Lei Mirun and Olivia Harvard have extremely excellent and sophisticated acting skills.

John Ford's "Blood Sea Flying Thunder"

John Ford is one of Hollywood's excellent directors and also a familiar figure to the audience. This "Blood Sea Flying Thunder" is his work. The content describes the heroic resistance story of a small team of naval patrol boats in the Philippine Islands after the outbreak of the Pacific War. Many wonderful sea battle scenes under the treatment of dehan Ford are extremely moving. It is a pity that there are a few small segments in the middle that are more scattered, but we can still see the director's majestic courage and organizational depiction.

Robert Montgomery, who has returned from retirement, plays a team leader in the film. His calm and sophisticated acting skills are still undiminished. John Wayne is serious and competent in his role.

Singing Film "Lilac Mountain"

"Lilac Mountain" is the first singing film co-starred by the king of singers, Bing Crosby, and Dorothy Lamour. Here, the screenwriter has arranged a relaxed and lively story, several variety-style singing dramas, the scenery behind the small theater, and a not-so-annoying love triangle, all of which bring relaxation and humor to the audience. Especially the singing scene at the end, where the stage and the audience are all in one, is really moving.

As entertainment, then this film is worth watching. Dorothy Lamour's change of style is still commendable, and Marjorie Landeau's Zhen is especially lovely.

The "Human Voice Darling" Is Still Worth a Look

This is a script adapted from a long novel. The story is extremely routine. A jealous husband has a beautiful wife. He murders two people and is finally exposed by another doctor and buried in a fire pit. The director's handling of the entire film focuses on psychological depiction, so the entire play is able to grasp the tense atmosphere.

The female lead, Hedy Lamarr, is famous in the film industry for her beauty. Her acting is still commendable, but her recitation is poor. In addition, Paul Lukas's results are indeed above George Brent. This is a Hollywood hard-core actor.

The photography technology of this film is excellent.

"Night in Paradise" and "A Thousand and One Nights"

These two films both boast to the audience with Western mythological stories and magnificent color films. But apart from some technical tricks in photography, there are really no new tricks. And those colorful colors are also quite vulgar.

It is a pity that the male and female protagonists of "A Song to Remember" are assigned to be the protagonists of the two films "Night in Paradise" and "A Thousand and One Nights".

Other

Abbott and Costello's "Here Come the Co-Eds" is one of the better comedies recently performed. In addition, James Cagney's "The Fighting 69th" and Joan Haig, Jenny Glenn's "Youth Singing" are all re-screened films.
