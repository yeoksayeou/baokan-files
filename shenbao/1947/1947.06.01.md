### The Council Quickly Conducted Discussions; Over a Hundred Proposals Were Passed; Suggested that the Government Revise the Sino-Soviet Treaty

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 31st] The 14th session of the Political Consultative Council was held in the morning of the 31st to begin discussing proposals. The meeting started at 9:30 AM, with 192 council members in attendance, chaired by Lin Hu. The council passed opinions on the review of the national defense report, opinions on the review of foreign affairs and overseas Chinese affairs reports, and 60 proposals. The First Review Committee passed 45 proposals, including 4 on national defense, 4 on military service, 3 on military assessments, 4 on military affairs in North China, 2 on military discipline, 9 on local armed forces, 3 on military personnel treatment, 2 on military education and training, 5 on the placement of surplus military officers and the support of families of war dead, and 9 others. The Second Review Committee passed 14 proposals, including 4 on Japanese reparations, 3 on the Macau, Hong Kong, and Yunnan-Burma issues, 1 on the foreign affairs personnel system, 4 on overseas Chinese affairs, 1 on the Sino-Soviet Treaty, and 2 others. Most of the proposals were sent to the government for reference and handling, followed by those requested to be handled or earnestly handled by the government, and the others were requested to be withdrawn or retained by the original proposers. The discussion proceeded smoothly. In the military and national defense sections, only Council Member Wang Guoyuan and others proposed "Requesting the government to issue a clear order to stop requisitioning in kind," and Council Member Li Peiguo and others proposed "Requesting the central government to fulfill the elimination of guerrilla units and the establishment of people's armed forces." Both proposals were slightly discussed. Regarding the former, Yang Buping explained that the proposal should be revised, suggesting that the government improve the system of conscription in kind instead of retaining it. Subsequently, Wang Zemin, the convener of the group, explained the review process, and it was generally agreed that it should be retained. After a vote, it was still passed by a majority of 117 votes, retaining it according to the review opinion. In the latter proposal, the issue of "guerrilla units" was heatedly discussed, and it was generally believed that the term "guerrilla units" was inappropriate, and they had made considerable contributions to local defense during non-wartime, so they should not be eliminated. It was decided to change it to "Requesting the central government to strictly reorganize the local troops in Rehe and establish people's armed forces," and it was decided to send it to the government for handling. Secondly, in the Second Review Committee, regarding the Japanese reparations section, Lin Zhong proposed that "to control Japan, our country should strive for an active position, dismantle and transport Japanese reparations materials, and conscript technical personnel from Taiwan Province to assist in the dismantling and transportation of Japanese reparations materials," changing "Taiwan Province" to "various provinces." Secondly, regarding the proposal by Council Member Wang Puhan and others to "ensure territorial integrity and maintain domestic order, the government should propose to revise the Sino-Soviet Treaty and quickly recover Lushun and Dalian," the original review team believed that it should be retained because, at a time when Sino-Soviet relations are tense, it is difficult in practice to propose amendments again before the Sino-Soviet Treaty has been implemented. At the same time, if this issue is raised, the reaction may not be ideal, and it may even increase harm to Sino-Soviet relations. Huang Yuren, Xie Bingxin, and others strongly advocated this view, believing that it should be retained. Xie also explained that if this proposal is passed, it would be tantamount to launching a war of nerves against Soviet diplomacy and causing some stimulation. Convener Zhou Qianchong also reiterated the review process, but Wang Yinhun, Pan Chaoying, and others emphasized that a review of the full text of the Sino-Soviet Treaty reveals situations such as the partitioning of our country's territory, the damage to our country's sovereignty, and the restriction of our country's administration. Therefore, they strongly advocated sending it to the government for handling. The atmosphere in the meeting was heated for a while, and speakers were very enthusiastic. Subsequently, the chairman summarized the opinions from all sides as roughly two items: sending it to the government for earnest handling and retaining it. After a vote, out of 164 people present, 123 people agreed to "send it to the government for earnest handling," and it was passed.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 31st] The 15th session of the Political Consultative Council was held at 3:45 PM on the 31st, discussing the reports of various review committees at the fastest rate. 195 council members attended, chaired by Li Huang. The meeting passed 73 cultural and educational proposals, one opinion on the review of the education report, 24 financial and economic proposals, 26 transportation proposals, 21 political proposals, and 7 temporary motions, totaling 151 proposals and one opinion on the review of the education report. Only three proposals were retained. The meeting adjourned at approximately 6:45 PM.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 31st] The Political Consultative Council continued its general meeting on the 1st to discuss the review reports of various groups.

### Suggestion to Reform the Monetary System Sent to the Government for Adoption

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 31st] The proposal by Council Members Yin Lianxian and others to suggest that the government reform the monetary system was passed by the 15th session of the Political Consultative Council on the afternoon of the 31st and sent to the government for earnest study, selection, and implementation. After the proposal was presented at the meeting today, Sun Shengwu and others argued that this proposal could only be sent to the government for reference. If it is passed according to the review opinion and sent to the government for earnest study, selection, and implementation, it may affect the market. Chen Baoyin, the convener of the Fourth Review Committee, stood up to explain that the reasons for this proposal are very substantial, and many of the proposed methods are also applicable. Therefore, the review committee decided to send it to the government for earnest study, selection, and implementation. In fact, the so-called earnest study, selection, and implementation are not much different from the so-called sending it to the government for reference. As for the argument that the passage of this proposal will cause market fluctuations, the review committee has also paid attention to this and believes that it will not have a significant impact. Finally, it was passed according to the review opinion. The four methods recommended in Yin's original proposal are recorded below: (1) Issue new banknotes guaranteed by gold, with reserves not less than 50% and a limited amount of issuance; (2) The issued legal tender should still be used as auxiliary currency, and no more should be issued, and the exchange rate between it and the new currency should be determined; (3) The exchange rate between the new currency and the US dollar or British pound should be determined to ensure its credit stability; (4) The new currency should be issued independently, and an independent issuance system should be established.

In addition, the following important financial proposals passed at the meeting on the 31st: (1) The proposal by Xi Lun and others to request the government to restore the reserve ratio system for the issuance of legal tender in order to rebuild the credit of legal tender and stabilize the value of legal tender. This proposal was sent to the government for selection and implementation; (2) The proposal by Wang Weixin and others that legal tender should be used completely within the territory of China, and all regional currency systems should be abolished immediately, was amended and passed, requesting the government to earnestly handle it; (3) The proposal by Wei Jiqing and others to request the government to stop issuing large amounts of banknotes in order to stabilize prices and save the economic crisis was sent to the government for reference; (4) The proposal by Xi Lun and others to request the government to allow the people to import permitted materials with gold and foreign exchange, so as to use the private sector's own strength to seek material abundance and price stability was passed and sent to the government for selection and implementation.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 31st] Pan Chaoying and 52 others recently submitted a temporary motion to the Political Consultative Council, requesting the government to take the initiative in diplomacy and select September 18th to hold a peace conference with Japan in Shenyang, and requesting the government to immediately notify the relevant governments of various countries and establish an organization to prepare for the reception of international guests.

### The Course of the Social Democratic Party's Dispute

Zhang Junmai Held a Press Conference to Report

[Our Newspaper Report] The Social Democratic Party held a press conference at 3:00 PM yesterday. Zhang Junmai, Xu Fulin, Feng Jinbai, Ji Yiqiao, Yang Yuzi, Jin Houcheng, and others attended. Reporters from various newspapers raised the issue that Zhang Junmai usually avoided seeing reporters, and Mr. Zhang expressed his apologies on the spot and explained his difficulties. He then gave a comprehensive report on the party's internal disputes.

After Zhang's report, reporters asked questions one after another, and the answers were as follows: (1) Expulsion from the party is not permanent in nature. Within the scope of law and reason, it is hoped that it can be restored as soon as possible. Wu Xianzi will not participate in the reform faction, nor will he separate from the Social Democratic Party. (2) Regarding the overseas committee's request for Wu Xianzi to represent 25 votes to attend the organizing committee, and Zhang's firm refusal, Zhang initially denied it, and then said that he could not accept this request. (3) Regarding the student unrest, it was said that persuasion should be used, and arrest is not the best policy. When arrest is implemented, it should be done in accordance with judicial procedures. As for how to quell the student unrest, efforts should be made to resolve the students' dissatisfaction, such as improving teachers' salaries and students' meals. (4) The sealing of newspapers should also be handled in accordance with judicial procedures. (5) Regarding the resumption of peace talks, Zhang believes that the government should extend the hand of peace, regardless of the other party's reaction. Even if the other party does not express anything, it is not a matter of losing face. When asked what contributions the party is prepared to make to state affairs, the answer was that it is still under consideration and cannot be disclosed at this time.

### The Political Consultative Council Passed the Proposal of Jiang Yong and Others; Requested the Government to Borrow from the United States; The Use of Funds to be Supervised by Public Opinion Organs

[Our Agency, Nanjing, 31st] When the Political Consultative Council held its 15th meeting on the afternoon of the 31st, it passed by a majority vote the proposal of Jiang Yong and 80 others to "Request the government to quickly launch economic recovery work and quickly consult with the United States to borrow funds for construction." The meeting decided that the proposal should be sent to the government for quick handling. In order to ensure that the loan is used specifically for construction and does not become bureaucratic capital, it was decided that after the loan is established in the future, public opinion organs will supervise its use. After the proposal was submitted, proposer Jiang Yong briefly explained that after our country has experienced a long war, various construction projects are waiting to be launched, but due to limited financial resources, the work has not been successfully realized. I deeply hope that the United States can lend us huge sums of money. The reason why this proposal was submitted by the Political Consultative Council is to show that this is the public opinion of the people of the whole country, not the will of the government. Subsequently, council members spoke one after another, most of whom expressed their approval. Only Chen Yaodong and others believed that the methods were worth considering. Yin Shuxian supported Jiang's proposal, pointing out that after this proposal is passed, foreign friends who intend to help China will be more forceful when speaking to their own countries. Chen Bosheng also believes that our economic situation is serious, which is known to both China and foreign countries. There is no need to avoid it. Since we are unable to carry out construction on our own, it is indeed acceptable for this public opinion organ to appeal to the United States on behalf of the government. Even in terms of foreign countries, there are many precedents for Congress to propose loan appeals. Chen Yaodong opposed the proposal for loans from public opinion organs. He explained that the US-Turkey and US-Greece loans have no problems, but the reason why our country's loan has not yet been agreed is not the problem of the United States, but the fact that our country has failed to put forward a concrete plan. At the same time, the government has also stated that everything depends on self-reliance. If this council passes the loan proposal, it will indicate that our economy is on the verge of collapse, which is not a glorious thing. He agreed that the government should come forward to borrow from the United States, but did not advocate that the Political Consultative Council overstep its authority. Rong Zhao did not agree with the use of foreign loans to make bureaucratic capital rich. Finally, the vote was announced. Out of 145 people in the audience, it was passed by a majority of 98 votes and sent to the government for quick handling.

[United Press, Nanjing, 31st] According to authoritative sources, the Chinese government has begun consultations with the US government regarding the US Export-Import Bank's loan of 500 million yuan to China. The Chinese government has already sent the plan for the use of the loan to Washington and submitted it to the US government. However, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has not commented on this.

### The Resolution on the Proposal to Postpone the Election was Retained

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 31st] At the meeting of the Political Consultative Council on the afternoon of the 31st, the council members had a heated debate on whether or not the various elections within this year should be held. At that time, some people suggested that due to the turbulent domestic situation, the elections should be postponed. However, the majority argued that if the council passes this proposal, it would infringe on the powers of the National Assembly and affect the implementation of constitutional government. Finally, it was decided that the original proposal would be retained.

In addition, the following other constitutional cases were passed at the meeting on the 21st: The proposal by Zhu Huiqing and others to increase the number of occupational representatives in the Legislative Yuan, and the proposal by Shen Zhijing and others to organize an investigation team for constitutional government preparation work.

### Shanxi Launched a Signature Campaign; Requesting the Implementation of the Principle of People's Livelihood

[Our Newspaper, Taiyuan, 31st] More than 20 leaders from all walks of life in Shanxi, including Wang Huaiming, launched a signature campaign to realize peace, requesting the central government to resolutely implement the Principle of People's Livelihood of regulating capital and land to the tiller, as well as Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings. The telegram sent to the Political Consultative Council for public decision suggested to the government: "If we want to achieve true peace in the country, we must first thoroughly eradicate the source of chaos. The private system has a big gap. Capital and land have become factors for the Communist Party to create chaos. The Communist Party takes advantage of this gap to form an unignorable destructive force and is planning to coerce a million young men and search for tens of billions of property within three months as capital for struggle. If we talk about peace after they grow stronger, it will only make them stronger. If we talk about war, it will be impossible to suppress them. We must fill the social gap and cut off the source of chaos before we can talk about peace or war."

### The Council Members Inquired about Peace and War; The Ministry of National Defense Responded in Writing; The Current Military Actions are Truly Unavoidable

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 31st] The Ministry of National Defense recently responded in writing to the council members' inquiries about peace and war, stating that the duty of the Ministry of National Defense is to ensure peace. The current military actions are completely forced and truly unavoidable. For the sake of the country and the people, the government has repeatedly exercised restraint and strived for peace and stability. If there are effective ways to promote negotiations, it will naturally be greatly welcomed. Regarding the military foundation that has been laid, the Communist army originally occupied 559 county towns. As of early April, 232 county towns have been recovered. The recovered railway lines total 1,165 kilometers within the customs and 5,145 kilometers outside the customs. Huaiyin, Linyi, Zhangjiakou, and Yan'an, all of which were bases of the Communist army, have also been successively recovered, depriving them of their political and military bases. The National Army has achieved great strategic success. The factors for the Communist army's failure are all present. It is hoped that unification and peace can be completed before the implementation of constitutional government, so that the country can embark on the path of construction.

### The Preliminary Review of the Peace Talks Proposal; The Draft Resolution was Submitted for Discussion at the Next Meeting

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 31st] The peace talks proposal, which is the main topic of the Political Consultative Council, was discussed in the plenary review meeting for a whole day, and then it was decided to transfer the entire record to the Special Review Committee for careful study. The committee held its first meeting at 8:30 PM on the 31st, chaired by Convener Hu Lin. First, he explained: (1) Zhang Yishan and others' temporary motion that the Political Consultative Council should, in the name of the general meeting, send a telegram to the whole country to clarify right and wrong, distinguish between benefits and harms, determine national policy, and promote unification, democracy, and peace; (2) The First Review Committee transferred the proposal by Wu Yunchu and others that rural bankruptcy and the people's livelihood are declining, and we should find ways to relieve the rural areas so that farmers can cultivate with peace of mind and increase production; (3) The Third Review Committee transferred the proposal by Li Hongwen and others that the war is expanding, the people in various areas of North China are dying and displaced, and they are suffering greatly. Please the government make a quick decision to save tens of millions of innocent lives. The above proposals were incorporated into the review committee for review.

Subsequently, the council members expressed their opinions. Jiang Hengyuan said: "Everyone should discuss in a harmonious attitude at today's meeting to solve the problem and jointly plan for the country." Therefore, today's meeting was very harmonious. Huang Yanpei, Wu Yifang, Xu Deheng, and others spoke one after another, expressing their opinions. Their opinions were much closer than before. Yang Buping, Wang Zemin, and others put forward the opinions of unconditionally resuming peace talks, the Kuomintang and the Communist Party immediately cease fire, and the Political Consultative Council appeals to both sides.

The council members all hoped for a quick peace talk and an end to the war to relieve the country's current crisis and the people's suffering. They hoped that the Communist Party council members would come to Nanjing to attend the Political Consultative Council as soon as possible. Zhao Xuefeng, Pan Chaoying, and others advocated clarifying right and wrong and recognizing the responsibility for the war. Subsequently, many council members requested to speak, but due to time constraints, some did not have the opportunity to speak. The chairman announced a summary of the opinions put forward by the council members: (1) Merge the proposals for review, (2) Integrate the methods proposed by Council Member Chu Fucheng and others, and elect drafters to draft resolutions and submit them to the next meeting for readers to discuss. It was decided to appoint the convener, Xu Xiaoyan, Hu Qiuyuan, and Yin Shuxian to draft together, and to hold the second review meeting at 8:00 PM on the 1st.

### The Legislative Yuan Began to Mediate the Student Unrest; The Political Consultative Council Put Forward Specific Opinions; Students in Nanjing and Peiping Will Stop Marching Tomorrow

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 31st] The Legislative Yuan passed the student unrest work, which began on the 31st. Lu Fu, Chen Guyuan, Fu Tongxian, Tan Tiwu, Liu Keqiao, Sun Qu, Xia Taosheng, Jiang Shoushi, and other eight people received student representatives twice on the 31st and visited Zhang Qun, Zhu Jiahua, and Zhang Lisheng. They persuaded the students to stop marching and resume classes as soon as possible. They asked Zhang Qun and others to love the youth and not exert pressure. The students who talked with the legislative members at 10:00 were Wang Shide, Deng Hongju, and other ten representatives of the student unions of the five regions of Nanjing, Shanghai, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Henan. They put forward six requirements, including stopping the arrest of students and abolishing the temporary measures for maintaining social order. The legislative members who spoke in reply were Lu, Chen, Fu, and Tan. They all persuaded the students not to march on June 2nd to avoid unfortunate incidents. Wang and others said: Regarding this matter, they are representatives and have no right to decide. Let _ discuss with each other. The talks ended at 12:00. The legislative members went to visit Zhu Jiahua and asked him to love the young students. In the afternoon, at 2:00, they visited Zhang _ to study the abolition of the measures for maintaining order. Zhang said: I also think that this measure is not entirely appropriate, but this is not the government exerting pressure on the students, but it is actually to love the students and prevent them. Since the measure has been announced, it is difficult to abolish it, and it is obvious that there are Communist Party members instigating this student unrest. The legislative members once again applied for the meaning of loving students. Zhang said that he has telegraphed Mayor Wu to inquire about the arrest of students in Shanghai. In the afternoon, at 3:00, the legislative members visited Zhang Lisheng and discussed the issue of loving students for a long time. At 8:00 in the evening, Lu and others received student representatives again, persuading them to stop marching and resume classes.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 31st] The opinions on the review of the education report passed by the Political Consultative Council on the afternoon of the 31st put forward the following specific opinions on eliminating the current student unrest: The causes of this student unrest have various factors, but the authorities' measures have not been perfect, and personnel mismanagement should also be reviewed. For the sake of the present, education should seek progress in stability. Do not make unnecessary changes to avoid giving others an excuse. As for how party and团 factions should withdraw from schools, responsible personnel of each school should be ordered to discuss it from time to time so that it can be realized as soon as possible. Schools should register students who participate in parties, and newspapers should publish them so that they can take responsibility for their words and deeds. At the meeting, Zou Shuwen suggested that educational measures that should be taken, such as the faculty and department issues of some schools, should be resolved immediately. The meeting decided to add them to the original review opinions.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 31st] It is learned that under the guidance of Legislative Yuan members, Political Consultative Council members, security authorities, and principals and professors of various schools, the student unrest in Nanjing has taken a turn for the better. The students, who were originally preparing to march and demonstrate on June 2nd, have now decided to stop the march, and various schools will gradually resume classes.

[Our Newspaper, Peiping, 31st] Peking University President Hu Shi attended a press conference at the invitation of the News Department of the Peiping Headquarters.

[Our Newspaper, Peiping, 31st] Hu Shi and Mei Yiqi separately invited representatives of Peking University and Tsinghua University to speak on the 31st, earnestly advising "June 2nd" not to take any off-campus actions, and stated that all activities on campus can be guaranteed without problems.

### Report on National Defense and Foreign Affairs, Political Council Passes Resolution

National Defense

[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 31st dispatch] The following is the resolution on the report of the Ministry of National Defense passed by the Political Council at its 14th meeting on the morning of the 31st:

This council has reviewed the section on national defense in the work report of the Executive Yuan, and listened to the oral report of Vice Minister Lin of the Ministry of National Defense. It has learned that the national defense authorities are generally able to implement the demobilization and reorganization of the army and national defense construction in a step-by-step manner according to the plan. However, there are still areas that need to be improved. The following is a detailed description of what we have observed:

The Policy of Army Reorganization Should Be Changed

(1) The policy of army reorganization should be changed to meet current needs. The task of the army is to protect the country and defend the people. At a time when border defenses are not yet consolidated and local order is still in turmoil, military affairs are no less important than during the War of Resistance. Therefore, in order to consolidate national defense and stabilize local areas, the policy of army reorganization should be to actively strive for the realization of the principle of elite troops, and to enrich their quality. As for the reorganization process, it is appropriate to enrich and improve the quality of the existing troops, strengthen their training, and strive to mobilize spirit, politics, and materials to coordinate with military strength, so as to achieve the task of protecting the country and defending the people.

(2) Focus on the weaknesses of the army and strive to improve them.

The common weaknesses of today's army are poor military discipline, low quality of officers and soldiers, inaccurate intelligence, and ineffective command. We must earnestly increase military spending, improve treatment, and strive to improve the lives of officers and soldiers. Strengthen education and intelligence training to improve quality. Eliminate long-standing malpractices, rectify military discipline, and enhance the strength of the army. We should pay close attention to the ability and reputation of commanders to ensure the cooperation of generals and marshals. Strict rewards and punishments, combined with reality, are especially important to demonstrate fairness.

(3) Enrich local armed forces and strive for coordination with military administration.

Given the urgency of stabilizing local areas today, in order to promote the widespread advancement of the national army's strength and achieve the effect of quelling the rebellion as soon as possible, it is urgently needed to enrich local armed forces, train them, and replenish their ammunition at any time, so as to assist the national army. The military officers leading the local armed forces should be selected locally to achieve twice the result with half the effort. It is necessary to ensure that the enrichment of local armed forces is closely coordinated with the facilities of military administration, so as to achieve the goal of early local stability.

Various Pensions Should Be Handled Conscientiously

(4) All kinds of pensions should be handled conscientiously.

Soldiers dedicate themselves to the country and go in and out of danger. If the disabled cannot support themselves and the dead cannot be compensated for their families, it is not enough to encourage and reward the capable. Therefore, the handling of pensions should be prompt and reliable, and the amount of pension should also be adjusted and increased. This is all related to the morale of the army and is of utmost importance.

(5) Retired officers should be promptly and properly resettled.

According to the report of the Ministry of National Defense, there are more than 250,000 retired officers. Most of these people are meritorious soldiers in the War of Resistance, and the capable ones should be selected and continue to be employed. Those who have already gone through the transfer procedure should also be guaranteed employment. Retired officers should be promptly assisted in returning to their hometowns, and local governments should be responsible for providing them with job opportunities or production subsidies.

(6) Military academy students should be employed as much as possible.

Military academies are the cradle of military cadres. The country has invested a great deal of effort in education and training, with the aim of enabling them to dedicate their knowledge to the country. It is a pity that some are left idle. Moreover, there is still a lack of cadres in the current army, so it is necessary to find ways to settle them as much as possible.

Foreign Affairs

[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 31st dispatch] The following is the resolution on the report of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Overseas Chinese Affairs passed by the Political Council at its 14th meeting on the morning of the 31st:

After reviewing the written report of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and listening to the oral reports of President Zhang of the Executive Yuan and Minister Wang of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, this council deeply understands that the basic foreign policy of the government is to seek harmony and cooperation between our country and friendly countries, and harmony and cooperation between friendly countries, to uphold the Charter of the United Nations, and to faithfully fulfill treaty obligations, which is our unwavering belief. It is also determined to defend sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity, maintain our international status, and maintain world peace. This council believes that this principle is correct and appropriate, and should be constantly strived for in order to achieve its thorough realization. However, this council cannot but provide opinions for the government, which are roughly as follows:

(1) Regarding the issue of the peace treaty with Germany, our country is a member of the Allied countries. Since we fought side by side during the war, we must jointly draft the peace treaty after the war without any room for objection. Moreover, the Five-Power Foreign Ministers Conference in London in September 1945 had a solemn resolution. Therefore, our country should not only be one of the invited countries for the peace conference with Germany, but also have the right to participate in the meeting to draft the peace treaty with Germany. Therefore, we hope that the government will firmly stand its ground and argue on the basis of reason, so as to achieve success.

Quickly Draft a Draft Peace Treaty with Japan

(2) Regarding the issue of the control of Japan, our country is the country that suffered the most from Japanese aggression. The policy of controlling Japan should be earnestly implemented in accordance with the recommendations of this council over the years. Our country has no intention of revenge against Japan. If Japan can establish a truly democratic and peaceful country and completely abandon its aggressive ideology, our country will not hesitate to give it a chance to regenerate. The representatives of our country attending the Far Eastern Commission in Washington and the representatives participating in the Four-Power Committee on Japan in Tokyo should, at any time and on any matter, clarify our country's position and determination, so that the Allied countries can agree with our country's solemn demands. As for the current issues of determining the amount of compensation, correcting educational thought, and stipulating light industry standards, we should base them on detailed and reasonable plans in order to achieve the goal. Negotiating a peace treaty with Japan is an inevitable stage sooner or later, and it is very important for our country to stand in an active position and quickly draft a concrete draft of a peace treaty with Japan.

(3) Regarding the issue of Sino-Soviet relations, the government has been making efforts to improve diplomatic relations in accordance with the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship. However, it is regrettable that the Soviet Union has not faithfully fulfilled the provisions of the treaty. In the future, the government should continue to use all diplomatic methods to argue on the basis of reason, so as to achieve the goal of earnestly implementing the treaty and recovering the sovereignty of the Northeast as soon as possible. Regarding the transfer of industrial equipment by the Soviet army in the Northeast and the damage caused to the local people, the government should continue to negotiate and demand compensation in order to maintain national rights and appease the anger of the people. As for the recovery of Dalian and Lushun, we should make efforts to negotiate quickly in accordance with the treaty in order to protect the integrity of our territory.

Negotiate the Recovery of Macau and Hong Kong and Kowloon

(4) Regarding the issue of the Sino-British Commercial Treaty, the United Kingdom is one of our country's main allies, and Sino-British relations have always been friendly. In order to enhance Sino-British friendship, we hope that the government will quickly negotiate a Sino-British Commercial Treaty with the United Kingdom in order to promote friendly relations and promote international trade.

(5) Regarding the issue of protecting overseas Chinese, the government should strictly order the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission to instruct all ambassadors and consuls to earnestly implement the policy of protecting overseas Chinese, and to carefully select candidates for ambassadors and consuls, and strengthen the effectiveness of overseas Chinese affairs in embassies and consulates in order to achieve the practical effect of protecting overseas Chinese.

### The Puyang Section of the Jinpu Railway is Open to Traffic, Journalists' Group from Beijing and Shanghai Visits Confucius Temple in Qufu

[Central News Agency, Yanzhou, 31st dispatch] The current popular opinion in China unanimously and urgently requires the restoration of transportation. Journalists have increased their belief in this during the opening of the Puyang section of the Jinpu Railway. Trains had already been running between Pukou and Lincheng on the Jinpu Railway. After the National Army cleared the Communist army between Lincheng and Yanzhou and between Yanzhou and Jinan, the railway rescue team, together with two railway corps, first restored the 87 kilometers and 80 meters of track and bridge engineering between Lincheng and Yanzhou. They successfully completed the project within 56 days at a rate of 1.84 kilometers per day. When they were laying the project, thousands of people would gather spontaneously every time they reached a station, cheering along the road. Even today, when the train that the journalists were riding passed through various places north of Lincheng, many farmers were seen by the roadside stopping their farming and smiling to greet them. The people's sincere support for the restoration of transportation almost moved the journalists to tears. Most of the stations north of Lincheng have become desolate. There are more than 160 carriages destroyed by the Communist army near Lincheng, and there are many piles of steel. The city appearance of Yanzhou is relatively tidy, because the National Army's Wu Huawen Department quickly defeated the Communist army's offensive here. According to the ride, it took six hours to complete the journey between Lincheng and Yanzhou today, averaging 15 kilometers per hour. The track is made up of odds and ends, but the train runs very steadily. Yanzhou is the middle station of the Jinpu Railway. The opening of the Puyang section has only restored half of the total length of the railway. The other half will also be able to be restored as scheduled with the support of popular opinion. The opening of the Puyang section has enabled the people of southwestern Shandong to obtain cheaper goods from Jiangnan, and at the same time, the people of Shandong are also preparing to transport their local products, such as Dezhou melon and Feicheng peach, to the south.

[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 31st dispatch] The journalists' group from Beijing and Shanghai who participated in the opening ceremony of the Puyang section of the Jinpu Railway arrived safely in Yanzhou at 4:30 p.m. on the 30th and will visit the Confucius Temple in Qufu on the 31st.

On July 9 of that year, large-scale arrests were carried out in Shanghai, Taicang, Kunshan, Wujiang, Changshu, Songjiang and other places, involving countless people, most of whom were killed. After the victory, the families of the victims accused him at the Jiangsu High Procuratorate. After investigation and trial, the charges were confirmed, and he was sentenced to life imprisonment.

Editorial

### The Verdicts of Japanese War Criminals Should Be Finalized Soon

On May 28th, Carbanto, Director of the Legal Department of General MacArthur's Headquarters in Tokyo, said: The Japanese are inherently bestial, and although temporarily suppressed, they will revert to their old ways once they are unrestrained. Americans today must not be deceived by the superficial diligence of the Japanese. Mr. Carbanto also said: Punishing Japanese war criminals is the most valuable development, because we can use this to uphold international law. Carbanto is an expert in international law and was the one who prosecuted the top-level Japanese war criminals. He made this argument seventeen months after prosecuting the Japanese war criminals, probably dissatisfied with the war crimes trials of the Far East International Military Tribunal, either because he believed that the trials were proceeding slowly or because the defendants' defense exceeded the scope. Therefore, Carbanto made this cautionary call. We believe that Carbanto's argument is clear and far-sighted, and the war crimes trials being conducted by the Far East International Tribunal also seem to have areas that should be criticized by public opinion.

The China War and the Pacific War launched by Japan were wars of aggression. Those who planned, instigated, or participated in the war were war criminals. This has become an unshakable conclusion for the world. It has been almost two years since Japan surrendered, and we have seen the "Far East International Military Tribunal" organize, with judges and prosecutors from China participating in the trial of Japanese war criminals. Regarding the arrest of war criminals, after the Allied forces entered Japan, on September 12 of the year before last, there was the arrest of 39 people, including Hideki Tojo, and the arrest of 7 people, including Ryohei Uchida, leader of the Black Dragon Society, and Hashimoto Kingoro. On September 21, there was the arrest of Doihara Kenji. On November 17, there was the arrest of 11 people, including Sadao Araki. On December 1, there was the arrest of 59 people, including Kiichiro Hiranuma. On December 6, there was the arrest of 9 people, including Koichi Kido. From January 23 to July 26 last year, there was the arrest of 93 people, including Yuichiro Nagano. The Prosecutor's Office of the Far East International Tribunal submitted the "Indictment of Japanese Class A War Criminals" a year ago, accusing 28 people, including Araki, Doihara, Hirota, Matsui, Tojo, Itagaki, Umezu, Shigemitsu, of crimes against peace, war crimes, crimes against humanity, and joint planning or conspiracy, listing 54 counts of charges. The submission of this indictment was earlier than the Nuremberg International Tribunal's judgment on Nazi war criminals, but the trial of Japanese war criminals only began for the first time on June 3 last year. It has been a year now, and it has only just gone through the stage of questioning witnesses, and now it is in the debate stage. According to Judge Webb, the presiding judge, if the trial is accelerated, it can be completed by the end of this year. In fact, the trial time is increasingly delayed, and the defendants' arguments and evidence are becoming more and more favorable, and the political significance of punishing war criminals is gradually disappearing. Those who are wise are certainly not satisfied with the slow pace of the trial of Japanese war criminals.

The procrastination of the Far East International Tribunal is manifested in the fact that Yosuke Matsuoka and Osami Nagano died of illness while in custody, Koki Hirota escaped prosecution by feigning madness, and the adoption of "cross-examination." The so-called cross-examination, also known as "opposing questioning," means that the lawyers of all levels of the accused can question witnesses, and they will refute the witness based on reason for anything that is beneficial to the accused, in order to seek exoneration from their own crimes. This kind of "cross-examination" is a characteristic of the Anglo-American legal system. When Qin Decun and Powell testified last year, the 54 Japanese and American defense lawyers of the accused did not fail to use "cross-examination" to do their best to confuse black and white and use clever words to evade responsibility. Other things, such as the attitude of the presiding judge, also caused the trial to be full of side issues, which made the prosecutors feel uncomfortable. For example, on August 6 last year, when American prosecutor Morrow presented the indictment of the Japanese invasion of China on behalf of the prosecution team, he accused the 28 war criminals of being fully responsible for the acts of aggression and atrocities. Presiding Judge Webb actually said: "Who can prove that the Chinese army fought against Japan in an unprecedented war?" He also said: "Who can prove that the actions of the Japanese army were more ferocious than those of the Huns?" Because of the attitude of the presiding judge and the severe criticism of the prosecutor's indictment, during a trial on April 22 this year, the American lawyer of Tojo actually said that "what Tojo and others have said for many years is exactly the same as Truman's position," to argue that Japan's aggression was due to fear of the spread of communism. Although the American lawyer's remarks were to protect the interests of the accused, it is inevitable that they went beyond the general rules. All of this is enough to make the trial of Japanese war criminals take a long time. We are really dissatisfied.

Some people think that carefully trying war criminals will be beneficial to the authenticity of history, and that Japan's conspiracy of aggression can be completely and frankly revealed to future generations. This hope is wrong. It is difficult to obtain credible information from the trials of Tojo, Minami Jiro, and others who are cunning and stubborn, and Doihara, Matsui, Umezu, and others who are tricky and sinister. Moreover, the more time is delayed, the more beneficial it will be to the war criminals. Therefore, the long-term trial of the Far East International Tribunal is an unnecessary method and should be revised quickly. Therefore, we advocate that the war crimes trials should be completed as soon as possible, that the verdicts of all important war criminals should be finalized as soon as possible, and that they should be subjected to criminal law, so as not to cause the world to doubt the Allied forces' ruling policies. Moreover, it is even more important that Class A war criminals Doihara, Umezu, Matsui, and others, and "secondary war criminals" such as Kagesa who are in custody, have committed heinous crimes in China. For the convenience of collecting evidence of their crimes, it is necessary to extradite them to China for trial. We make this argument not out of a desire for revenge against Doihara, Matsui, and other criminals, but to establish and consolidate the principle of international law, which is: "Wars of aggression are crimes."

In short, the trial of Japanese war criminals in recent years has not only been slow in terms of time, consuming manpower and financial resources, but also seems to be frequently losing sight of the purpose of the trial. Carbanto pointed out that punishing Japanese war criminals is to uphold international law, which is a clear argument. We believe that in order to safeguard the solemnity of international law and to implement the principle that "wars of aggression are crimes," we have the right to demand that the verdicts of Japanese war criminals be finalized as soon as possible!

### Internal Division in Democratic Party; Shidehara Resigns as Honorary President

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 31st Dispatch] In Prime Minister Katayama's formation of a coalition cabinet, Shidehara consistently advocated the formation of a four-party coalition.

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 31st Dispatch] Democratic Party President Ashida issued a statement on the 31st, emphasizing the reasons why the Democratic Party decided to participate in the three-party coalition cabinet, and said that in such a serious situation, it would be disloyal to our beliefs to only have a small number of parties bear the political responsibility.

### Communists Intending to Usurp Power, Coup d'état Occurs in Hungary, Nagy Resigns, Dinnyés Succeeds as Prime Minister

[Agence France-Presse, Budapest, 31st] The Hungarian cabinet held a special meeting this morning and decided to resign en masse. Prime Minister Nagy had tendered his resignation earlier.

[Agence France-Presse, Budapest, 30th] Hungarian Prime Minister Nagy, leader of the Smallholders Party, who has been vacationing in Bern, Switzerland, submitted his resignation today to the Hungarian legation in Switzerland, which will forward it to the Hungarian government. It is reported that the Soviet Union had accused Prime Minister Nagy of participating in an anti-republican conspiracy in Hungary a few days ago. Therefore, the Hungarian government telegraphed Prime Minister Nagy, instructing him to return to the country immediately. However, well-informed sources here believe that he will remain in Switzerland and does not intend to return.

[Associated Press, Budapest, 31st] The Hungarian cabinet announced today that Army Minister Dinnyés (46 years old) has been appointed Prime Minister, succeeding Nagy's vacancy. Dinnyés is a famous Hungarian soccer player who only held the rank of sergeant during the war. A few months ago, when the Communists expelled Army Chief Bassa and other officials, Dinnyés was appointed Army Chief. The cabinet also announced that Ambassador to Italy Kossa has been transferred to Foreign Minister, replacing Gyöngyösi. Before Kossa returns to the country, the Minister of Information, Mihály, will temporarily replace him. Gyöngyösi advocated for close ties with Western countries, leading to opposition from various left-wing parties. It is reported that Hungary will hold new general elections in September. It is widely rumored that after the Communists forced Nagy to resign, they turned to pressure President Tildy to comply. Until this morning, the Communists had been considering the former president of the National Bank, Ottványi, but at the last minute, a telegram from the Soviet Union rejected him, and Ottványi's hope of becoming Prime Minister vanished. The real reason for the Soviet action is still unclear, but it is rumored in parliamentary circles that this is because Ottványi's ancestors were German and he had worked in the Hungarian Army intelligence unit against the Soviet Union.

[United Press, Budapest, 31st] The Hungarian constitutional police are conducting a new investigation into the rebellion case, and several people have been arrested. It is expected that more people will be arrested. The personal secretary of the resigned Prime Minister Nagy, Kapok, was arrested today. According to the police, they found a letter from Nagy's daughter, Julia, in Kapok's possession, which stated, "Next time, use the code I am sending you now." The letter proves that Nagy continued to contact underground activities from Switzerland using coded letters. The police also stated that the evidence found proves that Nagy regularly used company funds owned by the Smallholders Party to support traitors.

### Political Turmoil in Italy Comes to an End, New Cabinet to Be Announced Within Days, Socialist and Communist Parties Excluded

[Agence France-Presse, Rome, 30th] Officials have just announced that the new Italian Prime Minister, leader of the Christian Democratic Party Gasperi, has formed an all-Christian Democratic cabinet, only recruiting some non-partisan figures as "experts" to participate in the new cabinet. Thus, Gasperi has successfully ended the political turmoil in Italy. The position of Foreign Minister is still held by Sforza. The current new government not only marks the end of the tripartite coalition situation in Italy, but also prevents the cooperation between the Christian Democratic Party, the Socialist Party, and the Communist Party from continuing. Prime Minister Gasperi visited President Nicola at 7:30 PM today and submitted the list of ministers.

[Agence France-Presse, Rome, 30th] Political observers have just commented that the exclusion of the Italian Socialist and Communist parties from the new cabinet may lead to renewed political and social unrest throughout the country. The extreme left-wing parties are actively opposing Christian Democratic Prime Minister Gasperi. The Communist Party has already announced that it will hold meetings in various places.

### U.S. Unlikely to Submit Large-Scale Foreign Aid to Congress Again, Said Democratic Senator George

[Our Newspaper Report] San Francisco, 31st broadcast: Democratic Senator George said that the U.S. foreign aid plan already includes aid to Greece and Turkey, relief to China and various European countries, and aid to various occupied areas, which is already quite considerable. It seems impossible to submit any far-reaching foreign aid plan to Congress again, but it is possible to submit a plan to aid Korea with 78 million to 90 million US dollars.

### Panic in Budapest, People Withdraw Money from Banks

[Reuters, Vienna, 30th] A dispatch from Budapest says: Following the most serious government crisis in Hungary since the end of the war, the situation in Budapest is panicking, with long lines of depositors withdrawing money in front of various banks. It is rumored that Kovacs, the secretary-general of the Hungarian Smallholders Party who was previously arrested by the Soviet army, has confessed that Prime Minister Nagy, Speaker of Parliament Varga, and Foreign Minister Gyöngyösi all participated in treasonous conspiracies. After the Soviet Union revealed this confession, it triggered the outbreak of the political crisis.

French Newspaper Commentary

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 30th] Regarding the political turmoil in Hungary, French political figures commented that this was due to the failure of the four-nation foreign ministers' meeting in Moscow. As the relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union gradually deteriorates, both are trying their best to consolidate their positions in Eastern and Western Europe before autumn. Hungary has now become the center of political means. The Soviet Union's actions are aimed at eliminating the Hungarian Smallholders Party, which currently holds the majority, in order to put the Communist Party in a favorable position.

U.S. and U.K. Pay Attention

[United Press, Washington, 31st] American sources believe that the demise of young Hungarian democracy and its transformation into a communist police state similar to Soviet-affiliated countries in Eastern Europe is due to a Soviet conspiracy coup. Nagy was the only leader who finally opposed the Communist Party. Diplomatic circles say that Hungary has effectively followed the countries of Bulgaria, Poland, Romania, and Albania into the arms of the Soviet Union. U.S. decision-makers have cancelled weekend vacations and are working extra hours, and may lodge a protest with the Soviet Union, urge the United Nations to conduct an investigation, and suspend economic assistance to Hungary when the Communists take over.

[Our Newspaper Report] London, 31st broadcast: A British Foreign Office spokesperson stated that the British government believes that the recent events in Hungary show that the Communist Party does have an attempt to seize power. When asked by a reporter whether the British side would recognize Hungary if a Communist regime were established, the British spokesperson said that this issue is under consideration.

### Truman Approves Foreign Relief Bill

### Iran Requests Loan from U.S., Totaling 55 Million US Dollars, Aiming to Modernize Iranian Army

[United Press, Washington, 30th] It has just been learned from here that Iran has requested a military loan of 30 million US dollars from the United States to modernize its army and gendarmerie. At the same time, Iran is also negotiating with the State Department to borrow a commercial loan of 25 million US dollars to carry out its domestic seven-year reconstruction plan. The leader of the U.S. delegation to Iran, Schwartzkopf, has returned to the United States to discuss the military loan. According to Schwartzkopf, the Iranian army of 100,000 and the gendarmerie of 24,000 now need Chinese equipment, namely motor transport vehicles, trucks, weapons transport vehicles, armored vehicles, tanks, jeeps, etc. In addition, wireless radios, telephones, mobile walkie-talkies, wires, etc., are also needed. Although Iran needs weapons and ammunition, it needs non-military supplies even more. Iran is still worried about the threat from the Soviet Union. Although the Soviet-backed Azerbaijan regime has disintegrated, the problem of the underground fifth column has not been resolved. Regarding Iran's economic situation, Iran is now planning to first borrow 25 million US dollars from the International Bank to support its economic institutions. The roads, railways, and airplanes built by Iran during the war have all been badly damaged and need to be repaired with loans to maintain transportation between major cities. In addition, expanding its irrigation system also requires funds to realize.

Regarding the guidance of the student unrest case, according to the decisions of the special committee organized by Deputy Speaker Xu and other 17 people, the大会修正通过平息学潮所采取之行动决议三点, (见告学生书内) passed the modified resolutions to appease the student unrest (see letter to students) and issued a letter to the students of this city as follows:

Students, when the third meeting of this council opened, you were striking because you were dissatisfied with the current situation and were injured for striking. We are all moved by your spirit of self-sacrifice. At the same time, we also think that the current political corruption, economic downturn, war, and people's lack of livelihood. This unreasonable phenomenon has caused your worries and anger, so that you cannot study with peace of mind. This is the joint responsibility of the government authorities and the opposition parties. But you must know that many current political problems, internal efforts, cannot be successful all at once. So you should stand up to awaken the society and pay attention to these issues and jointly seek solutions, but you should not be too emotional and seek temporary pleasure, causing more complicated disputes, or even causing strikes and strikes, to sacrifice society. This kind of behavior, even if the motivation is very pure, will lose the sympathy of most people. You only need to read the letter to students and the government by 102 professors from Peking University and Tsinghua University, such as Qian Ruisheng and Zhang Xiruo, published in the May 30th newspaper, and you should understand that everyone does not approve of your approach. Now the government has accepted your requirements, and those that cannot be resolved for a while are also considering practical and feasible solutions; you should stop at the right time, immediately resume classes automatically, work hard, and wait for the situation to improve. We believe that the situation will definitely improve. If you continue to strike, or even go out on a large scale on June 2, then when society demands stability, when the government cracks down on demonstrations, and when unscrupulous people want to take the opportunity to cause trouble, you will definitely lose the sympathy of society and reduce your own reputation, and may even unfortunately develop into a bloody tragedy. These are not alarmist and must be seriously noted.

### Three Resolutions

Regarding the actions taken by Mayor Wu Xuansiling on May 30 to quell the student unrest, this council, for the sake of protecting young people, has solemnly resolved as follows:

(1) Notify the government not to implicate and stop all unnecessary educational measures to effectively protect the safety of students. (2) For those arrested students whose circumstances are relatively minor, the government should be asked to promptly entrust their schools or parents to manage and educate them outside of custody. For those whose circumstances are more serious, if there is a need for custody and investigation before the student unrest subsides, the state should still be asked to give them preferential treatment in the spirit of protecting young people, without being harsh. After the student unrest subsides in the future, they should still be entrusted to their schools or parents for management and education and should not be sent to CCP areas. (3) For other young people arrested because of this student unrest, the government should be asked to handle them in the same way, referring to the above-mentioned meaning. Now we represent the good citizens of the whole city, represent your parents who love and discuss you, and earnestly ask you to resume classes as soon as possible, and stop demonstrations and demonstrations, so as not to add to the turmoil, deepen the suffering of this city, and trigger potential crises. Sincerely tell you, please think twice, Shanghai Municipal Council.

### Councilors Go to Jiaotong University to Inspect, Professors Accept Advice

[Our Newspaper Report] Councilors Zhao Junhao and Li Kaidi, members of the special committee for guiding student unrest, and Zhao Zukang, director of the Public Works Bureau, who is also an alumnus of Jiaotong University, went to Jiaotong University at 9:00 a.m. yesterday to inspect the latest situation and requested the professors of the school to take into account that the students have been absent from classes for a long time and that society is eagerly looking forward to the resumption of classes as soon as possible. After Director Zhao and the two councilors arrived at the school, they visited President Wu Baofeng and repeatedly retained President Wu, who had proposed to resign. Then, they met with President Qiu Weiyu, chairman of the Professors' Association, Zhong Weicheng, dean of the Management College and director of training, and more than ten professors, including Professor Zhong Zhaolin, and expressed their condolences. The professors expressed that the occurrence of this incident was very unfortunate, and they have been greatly stimulated in the past few days. They are ashamed of their lack of education, so the professors' meeting talked about striking. The two councilors and Director Zhao expressed deep sympathy for the professors' distress, but still requested them to propose to the professors' meeting that the strike "need not be implemented" and "reconsider it". At that time, the professors at the meeting accepted it. However, the professors also made four demands on the municipal government: (1) The perpetrators who beat the students must be punished. (2) Compensate the injured students for medical expenses. (3) Compensate the school for the destruction caused by this incident. (4) Guarantee that similar situations will not happen again in the future. The representatives replied that they would ask the speaker to convey it to the mayor.

After the councilors left Jiaotong University, they immediately returned to the Municipal Council and reported the above-mentioned points at the third meeting of the committee. At the same time, they also said that according to the inspection, one-third of the students of Jiaotong University have left the school. According to the professors at the meeting, the students whom the government wanted to arrest were no longer on campus. They also said that Jiaotong University students would never participate in the parade on June 2. Now the school needs stability, so please convey to the municipal government that no more personnel should be sent to the school to stimulate it.

### Private Eight University Authorities Meet with Mayor Wu to Discuss

[Our Newspaper's Report] The principals and representatives of the city's eight private universities, Jiang Shenzheng (acting education director), Zhen Qie Hu Wenyao, Guanghua Zhu Jingnong, Datong Hu Dunfu, Shanghai University Lin Li (education director), Daxia Ou Yuanhuai, St. John's Tu Yuqing, and Soochow Zhou Chengen (secretary-general), visited Mayor Wu at the Municipal Council yesterday at 6:00 PM (while the mayor was attending the Council's general meeting) to discuss the handling of the private school strike. The result was quite satisfactory. The mayor also stated that all arrested students would be treated favorably, and those found to have no excessive behavior would be released.

### Mayor and Speaker Hold Tea Party, Invite Jiaotong University Professors, Earnest Discussion on Student Unrest Results in Harmony

[Our Newspaper's Report] Mayor Wu and Speaker Pan held a joint tea party at the mayor's official residence on Anfu Road at 8:00 PM last night, inviting about forty people including the deans and professors of Jiaotong University's various departments to exchange views on the Jiaotong University student unrest and its solution. Also present were Director Fang of the Municipal Party Headquarters, Director Zhao Zukang of the Public Works Bureau (a Jiaotong University alumnus), Municipal Council representatives Tao Baichuan, Li Kaidi, and Zhao Junhao, and Legislative Committee member Sun Jiulu. The conversation lasted until late at 1:00 AM.

The result of the discussion was that both sides expressed regret over the incident, but because they exchanged views with sincerity and frankness, the government authorities and the Jiaotong University professors and alumni present were all deeply moved and gained a deep understanding.

During the tea party, the professors and others felt that the resolutions passed by the Municipal Council yesterday were appropriate. Mayor Wu then stated that the government had to take such measures to maintain local security and hoped that the school authorities could understand the government's difficulties. However, he promised that the Jiaotong University side would not implicate other students except for the eighteen students suspected of being communists (two of whom have already been arrested). At the same time, students who have not yet been arrested will not be arrested at the school. In fact, if the school resumes classes, the military and police will no longer come to the school.

At this time, a professor claimed that several of the students the authorities wanted to arrest usually had excellent grades and were about to graduate, and asked the mayor to be lenient in accordance with his love for young people. The mayor agreed to follow the resolution of the Municipal Council and entrust those with lighter offenses to the school or parents for supervision and education, while those with more serious offenses would be dealt with after the matter was over. As for the students who have already been arrested, they will be treated favorably, and the school and parents can rest assured.

Speaker Pan then stated that the government can provide free and meticulous treatment for the students who were injured in the conflict the day before yesterday (the 30th). As for the punishment of the perpetrators, if the investigation is verified, it will be handled through legal channels to make big things small and small things nothing.

After the meeting, Councilor Shen stated that the meeting that night went well. Generally speaking, Jiaotong University students are unlikely to participate in the parade again on June 2, and classes should resume on the 3rd.

The Jiaotong University professors' association decided to hold a meeting at the school at 10:00 AM today. The mayor and speaker were invited to attend the meeting. It is reported that the mayor has decided to send Director Zhao Zukang of the Public Works Bureau and the speaker has decided to send Councilor Li Kaidi as representatives to participate. The Jiaotong University professors' association will also host a reception for reporters at the International Hotel on the 14th floor at 3:00 PM this afternoon to report on the matter.

Mayor Wu and Speaker Pan are scheduled to hold a tea party at the mayor's official residence on Anfu Road at 10:00 AM this morning to entertain Fudan University professors. Director Fang of the Municipal Party Committee and Council representatives and Fudan alumni Xi Yushu, Zhao Yangxiong, and Yan Yilin will also participate.

(2) The Finance Bureau ordered the replacement of beer and soda banquet tax, which cannot be compensated. It also requested the removal of the words "wine and cold drinks" from the draft of the banquet tax collection rules and regulations in order to be exempted from tax.

### Nine Cases of Petitioners to the Council

[Our Newspaper's Report] There were several more petitioners to the Municipal Council yesterday: (1) The Second Branch of the Municipal Film Industry Trade Union requested justice for an inspector of the Queen's Grand Theater who was kidnapped and beaten by the First Brigade of the Garrison Command's Inspection Team.

### Dai Ruolin's Counterclaim Against Gui Yongqing Rejected for Insufficient Grounds

[Our Newspaper's Report] Dai Ruolin, the captain of the Hai Min steamboat of the China Merchants Bureau, who was accused in the "Fubo Warship Tragedy" of manslaughter, is currently on trial in the District Court. However, during the trial, Dai Ruolin also filed a counterclaim against Gui Yongqing, the acting commander-in-chief of the Navy, claiming that he should be held responsible for negligent collision and demanding compensation for losses. After reviewing the defendant's counterclaim reasons, Judge Wang Weicheng of the District Court determined that they were insufficient to hold Gui Yongqing criminally liable and ruled to dismiss the case. The main text of the ruling was: "The plaintiff's lawsuit is dismissed, and the costs of the lawsuit shall be borne by the plaintiff."

### Party Chief Fang Issues Statement, Hopes for Four Points on Student Unrest

[Central News Agency Report] Municipal Party Chief Fang issued a statement yesterday on the student unrest, stating: The recent arrest of illegal communist elements by the government should not be confused with the student unrest issue. Since the withdrawal of the Chinese Communist Party, many of its underground workers lurking in the city have mixed in schools, relying on their "underground struggle wrinkles" to wantonly disrupt social order and attempt to create social terror and chaos. In order to stabilize the locality and schools, the government should arrest these troublemakers according to law. The student unrest began in early May, originally due to internal problems in various schools, but later merged and evolved into a political movement, and it is not difficult to imagine that it was manipulated and instigated by others. Having engaged in school administration and educational administration for many years, I would like to express my sincere hope to all parties for the peaceful resolution of this student unrest from the standpoint of an educator. (A) On the part of the principals: The government's arrest of the main troublemakers in the various schools is precisely to assist the school authorities in seeking stability. The school authorities should cooperate with the government's measures, seek to restore normalcy as soon as possible, and not be passive, which will only increase the complexity of the problem. (B) On the part of the professors: Even if they have to express sympathy and concern for the arrested students due to the relationship between teachers and students, they cannot only care about a few arrested students and ignore the majority of students who hope for stability and resumption of classes. They should try their best to persuade the students to resume classes as soon as possible, so as to avoid the suffering of prolonged strikes for thousands of pure and studious young people. (C) On the part of the students: The student unrest should be thoroughly reviewed to recognize the conspiracy of the Chinese Communist Party. Now that the horses of the book group have been removed, I hope that the students of the various schools will no longer give the conspirators a chance to take advantage of them and cause long-term chaos. I especially hope that they will resume classes immediately in order to seek the stability of the school. (D) On the part of the parents: I hope that they can sympathize with the government's painful and severe measures and exhort their children to resume classes immediately and work hard in their studies. Finally, Fang said that what we need now is stability, and what the Chinese Communist Party has been creating for months is chaos and terror. Recently, it has attempted to direct a tragedy of "three strikes and one tragedy" on "June 2." All citizens should jointly prevent this conspiracy to disrupt public order. Understanding this, we should also work together to quickly resolve the student unrest in order to achieve the goal of stabilizing Shanghai.

### Council Meeting Discusses Proposals, Single-Person Rickshaw Case Reserved, Request the Executive Yuan to Approve Unified Management of Domestic Telephone Institutions, Intended to Allow Merchants to Build Crematoriums in Appropriate Locations

[Our Newspaper's Report] At yesterday's Municipal Council meeting, various proposals were discussed. Regarding public utilities, the case of "Requesting the Municipal Government to prohibit single-seat rickshaws within a time limit or to widen the dimensions to ensure passenger safety" was discussed quite enthusiastically. In particular, many opinions were raised on the first item of the method: "Before June 20, all single-seat rickshaws should be changed to double-seat, or the standard dimensions that meet safety standards should be widened, otherwise they will be restored to yellow rickshaws." As a result, the majority passed this case to be "reserved." According to Pang Jingzhou: (1) Changing single-seat to double-seat will further hinder traffic. (2) The Council has already resolved to remodel yellow rickshaws, and now wants to restore them, which seems inappropriate. (3) Who will bear the cost of remodeling is still vague. Chen Peide also believes that it is not rickshaws but large trucks that hinder traffic. Fei Shusheng also advocated reservation, and said that from the standpoint of some people, rickshaws are still an important means of transportation, do not hinder traffic, while motor vehicles often do not drive according to the rules, causing many accidents. Regarding the case of "In order to improve the Shanghai domestic telephone system, it is proposed to request the Municipal Government to forward it to the Executive Yuan for speedy approval of a unified management of Shanghai domestic telephones in order to facilitate expansion and meet the needs of the citizens," it was passed to request the Municipal Government to submit it to the Executive Yuan for approval of the unified management institution, and to send it to the Public Utilities Bureau to instruct the telephone company to pay special attention to improvement. There are other public utility cases that will be discussed at tomorrow's meeting.

### Rectify Lane Cleanliness

Regarding hygiene cases: The following were passed by the General Assembly: (1) "In order to change burial and promote cremation, imitating European and American countries," Method: It is intended to allow merchants to build crematoriums in appropriate locations, equipped with electric fire, in order to seek simplicity. (2) "Garbage is everywhere in the city, both Chinese and foreigners complain, in order to prevent the waste of sweeping garbage husband's quota, we should allocate husbands and servants according to the area, and encourage the establishment of private cleaning offices to contract in districts and remove garbage," the case was passed after the method was revised. (3) "Please rectify the cleanliness of the lanes, and strictly prohibit residents from randomly dumping garbage, in order to emphasize hygiene," Method: Please ask the Municipal Police Bureau to regularly send personnel to inspect the cleanliness of the lanes, and post notices in the lanes in advance, not only residents are not allowed to pour feces into the boxes, but also those who urinate everywhere or dump garbage outside the boxes must be strictly prohibited, and investigate the responsibility and strictly enforce penalties on the households that violate the regulations. (4) Feces trucks hinder hygiene, please order the Health Bureau to notify and improve the case. Passed. (5) "It is proposed to build a temporary isolation ward in Nanshi to benefit the sick and prevent infection," Method: 1. Please ask the Health Bureau to do its best to assist, consult with local businesses to proceed, and allocate funds. 2. If there is no hospital site, consult with Shanghai Municipal Second Hospital to allocate a part to serve as a temporary hospital site. 3. The period for handling all businesses is four months.

### Open Pudong Highway

Regarding public works: The passed motions included: (1) "The Pudong Chu Pudong highway wharf should be planned and gradually opened as soon as possible, so that the eastern part of the city can be developed equally with Yongxi," the case was sent to the Municipal Government to handle in accordance with the urgency. (2) The stinking ditch embankment smells bad, which hinders the appearance and hygiene, and endangers the lives of women and children. It is proposed to ask the government to fill it up as soon as possible to shock the public. (3) Please build Kangle Road, Anting Road, and North Xizang Road, etc. as soon as possible. (4) Please ask the Municipal Government to act in accordance with the resolution of the Municipal Council to promote the establishment of a permanent factory area along the Shanghai Northwest Zhai Road, and order the announcement. (5) Please ask the Municipal Government to add funds for dredging the Jiangwan Zoumatang.

### Elementary School Students Have Extraordinary Ambitions, Fly to the United States, Learn Aviation, Seven People Go Out Together Rashly, Fooled by Others, Fortunately Discovered

[Our Newspaper's Report] Tang Zhixiang, a 14-year-old student from Hengmao Elementary School in Zhimao Lane, South Tibet Road, recently heard rumors from passers-by that the United States has a "Sino-American Juvenile Air Force School" that is currently recruiting, etc. Tang immediately believed it to be true, and then vigorously promoted it in the school. His classmates Chen Guirong (14 years old), Xia Zhenze (16 years old), Gao Zhiqiang (13 years old), Lan Jipei (15 years old), Yang Xianghui (12 years old), and Ge Jinkai (13 years old) all expressed their agreement. They agreed to set off the day before yesterday afternoon, planning to go to the Jiangwan Airport to take a plane to the United States to apply for the school. Unexpectedly, when they passed through the Hongkou area, the sky was already late, so the seven children went to the Xinzhengyang Inn, Room 7, on Qiujiang Road to stay overnight. Late at night, a volunteer policeman came to inspect the room and suddenly found these seven children to be suspicious. He immediately inquired about the situation and learned that they had been fooled. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Songshan Police Station for their parents to come to the case to claim them. However, according to Tang Zhixiang: My sister is now working as a waitress in the Dashin Company. She knows an air force man named Zhang Chunming. I plan to go to Jiangwan Airport and ask him to introduce me to learn how to be a pilot in the United States, etc. The other children all claimed that they were fooled by Tang Zhixiang. Before setting off, they all concealed it from their parents. Before leaving, Tang Zhixiang left a letter to his parents, which read: "Dear parents... It has been fourteen years since I have been with you. You gave birth to me and raised me to adulthood, and you are very good to me. I will not forget your parents' kindness. I know that the country is now very strong. Why don't we go and contribute to the country? Now I hear people say that the United States has a self-reliant Air Force Juvenile School. I also want to collect some American characters and English. I hope my parents don't cry. As soon as I arrive in the United States, I will send a telegram back home. Please don't miss me. I wish you good health. Your son Zhixiang pays his respects."

### Shanghai Conscription Begins in July, Number May Be Reduced to 3,000

Commander Chuan Zhengmo of the Shanghai Garrison District went to Beijing to participate in a military officer training class and returned to Shanghai on the morning of the 30th. According to Chuan yesterday, regarding conscription matters, the Ministry of National Defense has ordered all localities to start today. Due to Shanghai's special circumstances, the preparatory work has not been completed as scheduled. Generally, it will be postponed by one month compared to other regions. As for the conscription quota, it is generally determined by the population ratio. According to this standard, Shanghai should originally conscript about 4,000 people, but after requesting a reduction, it may be approved for 3,000 people. In order to handle new recruits' training matters, the Garrison District will establish a replacement corps, but the candidates have not yet been determined.

### Zhan Liansheng's Application for Release on Bail in the Gold Rush Case Rejected

District Court Sends Letter to National Bank to Investigate Accounts

[Our Newspaper's Report] Zhan Liansheng, the director of the Gold Industry Association, has been detained for two months due to the Gold Rush case. Recently, Zhan applied for release on bail on the grounds that he was old and suffered from asthma and stomach problems, and that the defendants Lin Fengbao and Yang Anren in the same case were all released on bail. However, the application was rejected yesterday by Judge Wang Jiazhuo, who was in charge of the case.

Regarding the detailed verification of the accounts related to the Gold Rush case, the District Court sent an official letter to the Central Bank yesterday to investigate the bank's gold, foreign exchange, and cash accounts, the Audit Office's gold review report, and the cashier's office's new accounting books, in order to investigate whether the three defendants Lin Fengbao, Yang Anren, and Zhan Liansheng in the Gold Rush case colluded with officials and engaged in corruption and malpractice.

### Report by the Speaker on His Inspection of District Administration; Twelve Issues Awaiting Resolution Submitted for Assembly Discussion and Reference

[Our Dispatch] City Council Speaker Pan yesterday reported to the Council Assembly on his district administration symposium held from May 2nd to 9th and his inspection of district administration from the 17th to the 25th. He summarized twelve issues in the city that need immediate resolution, providing them for discussion and reference at this assembly. The Speaker's report and suggestions elicited enthusiastic applause from all councilors, who also proposed a motion to express their appreciation to the Speaker. Additionally, a resolution was passed to have the Municipal Government Policy Report Review Committee jointly review the report. The twelve most pressing issues requested by each district, as provided by the Speaker, are listed below:

(1) The powers and status of the District People's Representative Assemblies and the District Public Offices should be clearly and definitively established as soon as possible to lay the foundation for local autonomy. Although the powers of the District People's Representative Assemblies are clearly stipulated in the City Organization Law, they have no financial power, and therefore all resolutions on matters to be promoted or reformed cannot be implemented.

Define the District as a Legal Entity

It seems appropriate to define the district as a legal entity with its own financial power, and to grant the District People's Representative Assembly financial oversight authority. As for the powers and status of the District Public Offices, could the Municipal Government be requested to, in accordance with Article 34 of the City Organization Law, consolidate all branches of the Municipal Government's bureaus in each district into the District Public Offices, enriching each district? It is also hoped that a decision can be made on this. The business related to each bureau will still be directed and supervised by the respective departments.

Allocate Office Space

(2) Office space for the District People's Representative Assemblies, District Public Offices, and various Bao (neighborhood units) should be resolved as soon as possible. In my opinion, the police stations in the former concession areas are all high-rise buildings, are also municipal public property, and are part of the Municipal Government. Could a way be found to readjust them? If the police stations could spare a small portion of their buildings, the office space for the District People's Representative Assemblies and District Public Offices in more than ten districts could be resolved. As for Zhabei, Nanshi, and the suburbs, separate construction should be planned. For Bao offices, it seems that three to six Bao could rent civilian houses or allocate idle public housing to establish a joint Bao office, centralize operations, and simplify the staff.

(3) Boundary demarcation issues should be resolved quickly: In the city's Dachang District, Zhudi Town in the Xinjing District, and Qibao and Xinzhuang in the Longhua District, administrative chaos and disputes arise frequently due to the undefined administrative areas. These issues should be resolved quickly in accordance with the original plan of 1927, in consultation with the Jiangsu Provincial Government.

Planning for Drinking Water for the Poor

(4) The drinking water problem in impoverished areas should be resolved quickly: In the slum areas of western Shanghai and the Yulin District of Yangshupu, as well as in Nanshi, Zhabei, and Pudong, not only is there no tap water for drinking, but it is also difficult to obtain river water, and people are forced to draw water from foul creeks. If an epidemic breaks out, it will inevitably spread throughout the city. The Municipal Government should quickly plan to install tap water pipes, set up public water stations, or drill artesian wells and disinfect the water for the poor to drink.

(5) The problem of water and electricity supply in the suburbs and the determination of main road routes should be planned quickly: The central area of the city is densely populated and can no longer accommodate growth. Experts say that development should be directed towards the suburbs. However, to develop the suburbs, it is necessary to first develop suburban transportation, roads, and water and electricity supply, so that suburban transportation is convenient and living is comfortable, comparable to the city center. Then, people will naturally move to the suburbs without needing to be driven.

Roads Should Be Repaired Quickly

(6) Roads in various districts of the city are severely damaged and should be repaired quickly: The roads in various districts of the city have been damaged over the past eight years. Although repairs have been made since the victory, the roads are over 800 kilometers long, and the city treasury is strained, making it difficult to fully repair even the major thoroughfares. The roads in other districts are simply rugged and impassable. How can public support be mobilized to assist in the repair?

(7) The problem of garbage and excrement in the city should be resolved quickly: In various districts of the city, piles of garbage and excrement are often seen, the air is filled with foul odors, and mosquitoes and flies swarm, which is a source of epidemics. Quick and effective solutions should be sought.

(8) The construction of illegal buildings and shacks should be guided and controlled: Everywhere in the city, houses are being built indiscriminately on public and private land, regardless of property rights. This not only makes fire prevention difficult, but also obstructs traffic and clogs sewers and waterways. The government should be urged to quickly develop effective measures to designate public land to guide the poor in building shacks, and to control shacks that obstruct traffic and public drainage.

Increase Ferry Service

(9) Ferry services should be increased between Puxi and Pudong to improve transportation: Transportation between Puxi and Pudong currently relies solely on ferries. However, there is only one ferry terminal. It seems appropriate to add several ferry terminals at major docks, operating on both sides of the river, to facilitate transportation and promote the prosperity of Pudong.

(10) The occupation of land for the four airports and the civilian land, houses, and warehouses forcibly seized by central government agencies in Shanghai from the enemy and puppets should be cleared up quickly: Land for the airports should be requisitioned and compensated, and other civilian land, houses, and warehouses should be returned to maintain property rights and ensure the safety of the people.

(11) Floating shacks in the suburbs should be cleared up quickly: Floating shacks are all over the suburbs, and the poor build houses next to them. This is not only unhygienic, but also spreads epidemics. The government should quickly develop effective measures to clear them up.

(12) Land for schools in each district that are being dedicated should be allocated quickly: When Chairman Chiang celebrated his 60th birthday last year, this council launched a campaign to dedicate schools to celebrate his birthday, with the aim of popularizing compulsory education as soon as possible. Each district organized committees and raised funds separately. However, land for schools in each district has not yet been allocated, causing work to stagnate. The Municipal Government should quickly allocate public land to be used for schools in order to complete the project.

### Drunken Man Sets Fire Because He Hates His Mistress for Not Coming Home; Seeks Death Regardless of Public Safety, Claiming Life is Meaningless

[Our Dispatch] The District Procuratorate yesterday conducted a preliminary investigation into a bizarre "endangering public safety" crime, which is quite laughable. A certain Huang Qi, about fifty years old, who works as a messenger at the Central Bank, lives at No. 302, Dihua Middle Road. His mistress runs a Meiji cigarette paper store, and Huang is very resentful because she has unchaste behavior outside. Around 11 p.m. on May 26th, Huang returned to the store drunk and, seeing that his mistress had still not returned, conceived the idea of ​​committing suicide. He then set fire to oily paper scraps and cloth, and thick smoke penetrated into the house of Qiao Rujia, a resident of the pavilion. Qiao woke up in fright and woke up the tenants upstairs and downstairs, including Huang Shisu, who opened Huang's door and used water to extinguish the fire, luckily preventing a major disaster. Qiao and others, angry that Huang's personal grievances endangered public safety, took him to the police station, which transferred him to the District Procuratorate on charges of "endangering public safety." Yesterday, Prosecutor Yu Xin summoned the plaintiffs Qiao Rujia, Huang Tulian, Zhu Shenqian, Ma Shaoning, Zhou Datong, Yao Shouqi, Chen Zhihao, Xu Huichuan, Jin Zongpei, Ji Chengan, and others. Huang's mistress did not appear in court. According to the defendant, he had been resentful for a long time because his mistress often went out and did not return, and happened to be drunk that night, so he had the idea of ​​committing suicide. The prosecutor asked why he had to set fire to commit suicide, wouldn't that endanger the safety of others? Huang said that he felt that the world was meaningless, so he might as well set a fire and perish together. Prosecutor Yu said that the case still needed to be investigated and rescheduled for further questioning.

### Nanjing Student Organizations United to Launch Patriotic and School Protection Movement; Sent Representatives to Shanghai Yesterday to Host Reporters Today

[Our Dispatch] Ten representatives from the Nanjing Student Organizations United Patriotic and School Protection Student Association arrived in Shanghai yesterday. These representatives, in order to launch a patriotic and school protection movement, are scheduled to host reporters at the New Life Club at 3 p.m. today to make a report. The association has written to the National Government, explaining that the students of Nanjing Central University and other schools initially demanded that the government increase public funds, but were exploited by the Chinese Communist Party and the Democratic League, triggering a violent student movement, demanding that the government strictly enforce the law and stabilize the people's hearts, and inviting the Chinese Communist Party delegates to come to Nanjing immediately to attend the National Political Council and restore peace talks. The association also has "A Letter to the National Political Council", "A Letter to the Chinese Communist Party", and "A Letter to the Democratic League", urging the Chinese Communist Party to stop all inflammatory and destructive political struggles, and hoping that the Democratic League will truly withdraw from schools.

The Association's Declaration is Explored as Follows:

"After repeated consideration, we can no longer remain silent in the face of the truth; we abandon sentiment, and under the encouragement of justice, we must roar out the voice of our hearts. The current motherland is in extreme hardship. People start from different positions and shout out their own pain from different perspectives of interest and harm. The facts of bitterness and hardship are placed before hearts permeated with fresh blood for judgment, and ugly crimes are heavily eroding the soul of society. With each stimulus and swing, the foundation of the Chinese nation is shaking. But who is supporting this shaken foundation? Who is saving this raging torrent that is running wild? Looking at the countries of the world after the war, the painful lessons of war have forced the people of each country to strengthen their national consciousness, and the people of each country have sacrificed their prejudices and biases, seeking public happiness within the scope of the country. But, looking at our country again, people are displaced everywhere, society is in turmoil everywhere, and high prices and the pain of civil war are heavily pressing on everyone's heart. The recent student movement is undoubtedly a legitimate reform demanded by some students regarding the current situation. At the same time, it is also undeniable that some people are taking the opportunity to incite, seeking to create social chaos and promote the collapse of the government. But legitimate reform must seek progress under stable conditions, and the attempt to create chaos and overthrow the government is really a conspiracy to overturn the country and destroy society. Moreover, under the current difficult situation in the country, is it necessary to resort to strikes and parades to make reasonable demands? We cannot bear to see studies being increasingly abandoned, and we cannot bear to see the form of turmoil increasingly expanding. Our fellow students have formed the Patriotic and School Protection Student Association, adhering to the purpose of loving the country and protecting schools, and sincerely appealing, and we are determined to carry out our purpose with action. We hereby put forward our propositions as follows: (1) Looking at the current situation of the student movement, it seems that students and the government are standing on opposing positions, and this concept must be corrected immediately. We believe that the government should adopt the reasonable demands of students, and the government should guide the excessive demands of students. Students themselves should know the big picture, take care of the overall situation, take studies as the foundation, and take self-love as the priority. (2) All parties should no longer use students as tools for political struggle; at the same time, students should follow reason, distinguish right from wrong, so as not to be exploited by ambitious people in secret. (3) The Communist Party must give the country an opportunity to recuperate and give up the attempt to seize power by force. Other parties must also abandon prejudices and jointly plan for national affairs. (4) People from all walks of life in society must understand the difficulties of the times and avoid social turmoil, so as not to shake the foundation of the country. At the same time, they must stimulate just public opinion and maintain national peace in the process of realizing political democracy. (5) While the international situation still allows China to engage in construction, the people of the whole country should denounce any destructive behavior and mobilize the power of the whole people to actively build the country."

### After the Financial and Economic Departments' Instructions were Revealed, the Shanghai Stock Market Suffered a Great Loss, Brokers Disappointed in the Prospect of Deliveries

[Report from Our Newspaper] Regarding the case of securities exchange brokers paying margin with US dollar bonds, the new instructions from the Financial and Economic Departments have been issued (see yesterday's newspaper). It is stipulated that for the part of the broker's margin that can be substituted, the US dollar bonds that are to be paid must be paid in full at 70% of their face value before the end of May this year. The same shall apply to the margin substitutes for delivery transactions. However, before the US dollar bonds are purchased, cash may be temporarily paid to offset them, but they must still be purchased by June 15th. Those who have not yet purchased them shall be offset with cash from June 1st. In addition, the deadline for purchasing the margin substitutes by the end of May has been extended to June 4th this year because the brokers have not been able to complete the procedure. As for the extension of the delivery transaction, the stock exchange has also received instructions from the departments that it is allowed to be extended for another month from the date of the document (i.e., May 30th).

### Directors of the Brokers Association to Visit Wang Zhixin Today

The Securities Exchange Brokers Association received the official document from the stock exchange regarding this matter at around 5 pm yesterday. Several standing directors of the association immediately held a discussion meeting and planned to visit Wang Zhixin, general manager of the stock exchange, this afternoon for consultations. It is reported that the brokers' opinions are as follows: (1) The new departmental instructions will not have a significant impact on the future of the stock market. The brokers are already prepared and are not as caught off guard as they were when the previous departmental order was suddenly issued. (2) The amount of delivery transactions may decrease as a result. Therefore, US dollar bonds may lack the capacity to be digested in the part of the margin substitutes for delivery transactions. The brokers also stated that it would be better to end the delivery transactions as soon as possible to reduce the pressure from the short side.

### Market Sentiment Scattered, Short Sellers Active

The Chinese stock market suffered another special blow yesterday. Although the exchange did not explicitly state that the announcement of US dollar bond margin had arrived, people were aware that the rumors of the past few days had been partly substantiated and felt a lack of interest. The lineup was scattered and suffered another sharp decline. However, short sellers continued to cover at low prices, and there were frequent rebounds, making the situation extremely volatile. The market opened in the morning with people panicking, and the opening was very low. The delivery of Yongsha even approached the limit of the price drop. After the opening, No. 129 purchased forcefully, and No. 171, No. 219, and retail investors also participated, and the delivery of Yongsha immediately rebounded from the bottom of the price drop to over 7,200 yuan. No. 235, No. 137, and No. 94 took profits at high prices and fell back to 7,050 yuan. No. 152, No. 218, No. 157, No. 102, No. 45, No. 117, No. 224, No. 119, No. 153, No. 155, No. 36, No. 32, and No. 22 all participated. Gangshen Telegraph shrank to 13.5 yuan, and the delivery of Yongsha rebounded sharply to 7,550 yuan. Xin Guang also rose sharply under the forceful purchase of No. 152. No. 85, No. 94, No. 83, No. 199, No. 89, No. 197, No. 63, No. 154, and No. 190 sold off together. After 11 o'clock, it gradually fell to within 7,250 yuan. No. 160, No. 105, No. 180, No. 164, No. 196, and No. 109 took advantage of the low prices to advance to over 7,450 yuan. No. 141, No. 148, No. 65, No. 142, No. 89, No. 112, and No. 32 added to the sell-off, and it once fell back to 7,050 yuan. The buying interest of No. 16, No. 54, No. 106, No. 129, No. 219, and No. 23 suddenly became strong, and Xin Ya announced a limit up, with news of a capital increase, which stimulated buying interest. In addition, the rumor of parallel line banknotes rose again, and the midday close rose to 7,240 yuan. After the close, No. 13, No. 224, and No. 35 all participated, and the asking price rose to over 7,300 yuan. As a result, compared with the previous close, Ji Yongsha, Huafeng, Qinxing, Zhongfa, and Xinhua all fell by about half a percentage point. Xinhe and Yonggong fell by 10%, Xin Guangjingfu rose slightly, Rongfeng, Zhongfang, Tongyi underwear fell by more than half a percentage point, Guohuo fell by 10%, Zhongsi rose by 10%, and Xin Ya was the only one to announce a limit up. The rise and fall of the remaining stocks were minimal. In delivery transactions, Ji Yongsha, Huafeng, Yonggong, Jingfu, and Qinxing all fell by more than half a percentage point, Xinhe fell by 10%, and Xin Guang rose slightly. Outside the market, the old stocks Huashang, Nanyang, and Dasheng Three Factories were flat and tired, and the rest rose slightly.

### Government Bonds Fall Back, Foreign Stocks Still Rise

Government bonds fell back slightly yesterday, and high prices were difficult to sustain. Tong Bing opened at 17,000 yuan in the morning, with a low price of 14,700 yuan, and then stabilized slightly. Room 360 and Room 533 purchased, while Baolong and retail investors sold. About 6.7 million transactions were made. As a result, all bonds fell compared to the previous close.

Yesterday, the securities brokers in foreign stocks still purchased Yisha Jardine Matheson and Huidefeng, while the Guangdong brokers purchased British-American Tobacco. Retail investors sold, and Yisha did not move much. The rise was far less than that of British-American Tobacco. Yisha opened at 75,000 yuan in the morning, with a high price of 79,000 yuan, and hovered around 77,000 yuan near noon. As a result, compared with the previous close, British-American Tobacco alone rose by 10%, and Huide, Guang Paper, Shipping, and Steel each rose by half a percentage point. Although Yisha Kenzhi rose, it was not much.

Hankou ranged from 15 yuan to 40 yuan. Xi'an ranged from 10 yuan to 20 yuan. Changsha ranged from 10 yuan to 40 yuan. Kunming ranged from 25 yuan to 50 yuan.

### Foreign Tea Market Weak

[Report from Our Newspaper] Recently, the export of Chinese tea has become increasingly rigid. According to people in the industry who told the reporter: At present, foreign tea prices are frequently falling, and it is heard that Egypt and other places currently have more than 1,500 tons of black tea in stock, and have ordered another 3,000 tons from the Tin Customs at a lower price. Therefore, the tea industry there has abundant reserves, and the selling price is even lower. The production cost of Chinese tea, on the other hand, is still increasing sharply in the midst of soaring prices. Looking at this situation as a whole, how can the export of Chinese tea be smooth? Yesterday, the result of the foreign tea market's consultations was still stalemate, and the transaction was tired and unable to rise. Only Jardine Matheson purchased about 200 boxes of Wuyuan Dabang from Huacheng Tea Company for the last year, at a price of 560,000 yuan per load. Although the market sentiment has not fallen, it is generally softening. The sales of other domestic teas are still available, and the market situation is continuing to stabilize due to the availability of supply, and the market is mostly the same as the previous day.

### Soap and Matches Continue to Rise

Yesterday, the prices of Guben and Arrow soap on the daily necessities market continued to rise by 4,000 yuan per case due to good sales. Guben soap was priced at 384,000 yuan per case, and Arrow soap was priced at 376,000 yuan per case. Huangxiangmao was stable, and Baixiangmao was slightly higher by 2,000 yuan. Henry, Sun Moon, Ox, and Dingfeng were also firm. The price of US-made matches was 2.63 million yuan, an increase of 50,000 yuan from the previous day. Fengfeng was 2.62 million yuan, also up 20,000 yuan. The market for new brands of goods was also brisk.

### Cigarette Market Turns Promising

The cigarette market situation yesterday seemed to turn flat and tired in the morning. 10-cigarette British cigarettes hovered from 7.46 million to 400,000 yuan. The situation improved in the afternoon and finally rebounded to 7.5 million yuan, an increase of 50,000 yuan from the previous day. Lao Dao was 6.5 million yuan, also continuing to rise by 25,000 yuan. The remaining Chinese cigarettes saw mixed gains and losses.

### Taiwan Caustic Soda Shipped to Shanghai

Taiwan Alkali Industry Company is jointly operated by the Resources Committee and the Taiwan Provincial Government. The caustic soda and hydrochloric acid produced by the company are supplied to Taiwan Province and shipped to Shanghai for distribution. It is heard that recently, more than 200 tons of solid alkali have been shipped to Shanghai in batches. In addition to the majority of the batch being distributed to China Textile Company, general private industrial manufacturers have the right to be distributed. It is also heard that the company's personnel stationed in Shanghai said that the factories belonging to the company will gradually increase production and will be shipped to Shanghai in a steady stream. In the future, there should be no shortage of caustic soda in the Shanghai market.

### Sluggish Rice Trade, Narrow Market Price Fluctuations: Four Banks Approve Loan of 176 Billion Yuan to Flour Mills

The rice market experienced narrow fluctuations. Yesterday (the 31st), both North and South rice markets remained sluggish. However, influenced by rising prices of various goods, people were uneasy, and holders of goods raised market prices, turning the market from weak to firm. In the North market, white japonica rice and early thin rice were slightly pushed higher, while other indica rice showed mixed trends of falling and flat prices. In the South market, increases were more common than decreases, but milled indica rice continued its sharp decline, falling to 20,000 yuan. Yesterday, the total amount of rice arriving at both North and South markets was over 4,800 shi (a unit of dry measure), not including goods unloaded at the station, which need to be registered on Monday.

New flour supplies are approaching, and the distribution of flour is being implemented, further weakening digestion, with a drop of 3,000 to 5,000 yuan. Foreign flour also fell by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Wheat bran continued its downward trend, falling by another 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Soybean cakes saw activity in rural consumption, rising by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan. Soybean oil factories were actively procuring, with lively digestion, resulting in an increase of 6,000 to 7,000 yuan, up to 10,000 yuan. The oil market was initially firm but then flattened. Sesame oil saw an increase of 10,000 yuan, while refined oil and soybean oil remained unchanged. Vegetable oil was slightly firm, and crude oil maintained a firm state, with minor fluctuations.

Mung beans remained stagnant, and adzuki beans saw few inquiries, with a decline of 4,000 to 5,000 yuan. Sesame from Southeast Asia continued to advance steadily, rising by another 10,000 yuan. Raw peanuts from Guangdong continued to be in demand, gradually rising, with another increase of 10,000 yuan. Sorghum continued to weaken by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan, and corn lacked vitality. Recently, Sichuan has reported arrivals of raw peanuts and mung beans, and samples of new silk from Hankou have arrived.

The Fourth District Flour Industry Association, due to the emergence of new wheat and a lack of funds, submitted a document to the Four Banks Joint Treasury last week, requesting approval to issue wheat loans, and provided five principles. The Four Banks Joint Treasury reduced the proposed loan of 1.8 billion yuan for factories producing 1,000 bags per day to 1 billion yuan, with other cases following the same logic. The Association requested a loan of 320 billion yuan based on the provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui. According to the Four Banks' regulations, the actual amount received would be approximately 176 billion yuan, with an interest rate of 4%.

It is also learned that the Ministry of Food has a planned production and sales plan for flour and wheat nationwide this year, which will be announced in early this month. In the future, the business of each flour mill will be based on the Four Banks Joint Treasury's loan in exchange for the mill's finished products, with a reasonable legal profit added. Under the circumstances where manufacturers have limited funds and rely on government loans, although this provision of processing on behalf of the government deprives each factory of any hope of prosperity, they still intend to accept it given the current difficult environment. The loan disbursement date will be in mid-this month, and the complete details will be notified to the industry by the Four Banks Joint Treasury next week.

### Anhui Province Lifts Ban on Rice Transportation

The food administration authorities learned that the Anhui Provincial Government has formally lifted the ban on rice grain transportation. Starting immediately, there will be no more restrictions on rice leaving the province, limited to the provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang. Currently, rice from rice-producing areas such as Wuhu and Bengbu will be used to supply the city's food needs. In addition to the land route through the Jiangnan Railway and the transfer from Wuhu to Beijing by train to Shanghai, the water route will be handled by state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and Minsheng Shipping Company and other Yangtze River steamers. It is reported that the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company already has the Yanmin and Haiyu ships, carrying 3,000 bags of rice from Wuhu to Shanghai.

### Ministries of Agriculture and Economics Seek to Avoid Suppressing Cocoon Prices

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Silk Production and Sales Coordination Committee of the Ministries of Agriculture and Economics, in order to protect silkworm farmers and ensure they receive reasonable prices, and to avoid the suppression of cocoon prices, has specially stipulated the following handling methods:

(1) Anyone who does not comply with the standards stipulated by this committee and suppresses cocoon prices for purchase will be dealt with in accordance with these measures. (2) Based on the results of sampling and trial reeling, compare the standard discount price with the total price of fresh cocoons actually purchased.

(3) The aforementioned amount of the suppressed cocoon price shall be fully extracted and stored in a special account as funds for silkworm industry improvement. (4) The use of the industry improvement funds shall be determined by the provincial industry administrative agency to investigate the industry conditions in the original cocoon collection area, implement appropriate improvements, formulate a plan, and execute it after obtaining the approval of this committee.

### U.S. Exports to China Ten Times Greater Than Before the War

The value of U.S. exports to China in 1946 was more than ten times greater than the pre-war figures. The value of goods sold to China in 1938 was US$34.7 million, while in 1946 it was US$466 million.

### Jewelry Industry in Difficult Situation, Fang Tianbao Announces Closure, Jewelry Industry Requests Relief from the Mayor Yesterday

Since the central government promulgated emergency economic measures to suspend the distribution of gold, the jewelry industry in this city has petitioned several times, but the results have not been very satisfactory. Most jewelry stores in Beijing have voluntarily closed down. This trend has begun to spread to Shanghai. According to reporters, Fang Tianbao, a major jewelry store on Nanjing Road in this city, announced yesterday by the shareholders' meeting that it would close down on June 1st. Each employee will be given a severance payment of 1 million yuan, but the employees expressed their opposition, arguing for a severance fee of 8 million yuan per person. Because the difference between labor and management is quite large, negotiations were still in progress overnight yesterday. It is uncertain whether the store will open today. The store just opened last year and its business was still good, but since the suspension of gold distribution, the main business has been stalled, and the expenses are huge, so it has come to the point of closing down. It is heard that a large number of jewelry stores will also close down during the upcoming Dragon Boat Festival.

Representatives of the jewelry industry in this city, Yao Guiqing and four others, went to the city government to meet with Mayor Wu at 10:30 AM yesterday, and reported on the current difficult situation of the industry. They also stated that the industry has been virtually suspended for a long time, and the expenses such as employee salaries are huge, making it difficult to maintain this situation for a long time, and requested relief.

### Sharp Rise in Silk Prices After the Lifting of the Cost of Living Index Freeze, Factory-Processed Products are Firm, Rise in Artificial Silk is Moderate

Yesterday, the rise in artificial silk prices in the market had slowed down. No. 120 Takayama silk was traded at 20.1 to 22 million yuan in the morning, with the lowest bid being over 19.8 million yuan. Subsequently, due to strong buying interest, it finally rose to 30 million yuan at the close, leveling with the previous day's price. In the afternoon, a price of over 20.5 million yuan was bid. Other brands of goods did not fluctuate much. Yesterday, the market for factory-processed products remained firm. Holders of goods generally refused to sell, causing prices to rise again. Grade A products were priced at around 28 million yuan, and Grade C products were priced at 27 million yuan. Due to the tight money supply at the end of the month, no one inquired and there were no transactions. There were also no transactions in dry silk. Prices for all grades were about 1 million yuan higher than the previous day's prices. Yesterday, the China Silk Company opened 20 bales of silk, Grade D, priced at 25 million yuan, similar to the previous day's price.

Yesterday, silk prices in the market rose sharply. After the announcement of the lifting of the cost of living index freeze, labor costs increased sharply and costs increased, so both insiders and outsiders had buying interest, creating a booming situation. Meiya quilt covers were priced at 10 million yuan, and Dacheng quilt covers were priced at 9.7 million yuan, but there were few transactions in the market. The highest price for checked crepe was 36,200 yuan, but buyers were hesitant, so it dropped by 200 yuan. The final selling price was 5,900 yuan. The price for the next week was 6,300 yuan, but it did not open for trading. Prices for Shenghang and other goods also rose in the place of origin. Rayon brocade crepe was priced at 20,000 yuan in the morning. Dull spinning and striped spinning, etc., did not rise by about 10%. However, prices were too high, and formal transactions were extremely rare.

### Yarn and Cloth Continue to Rise

Yesterday, the cotton yarn market was firm because the cost of living index for workers increased, and the cost of yarn production for factories will inevitably increase in the future, so the market was firm. There was active demand in the market, and new buyers participated, causing prices to gradually rise. The price of 20-count double horse yarn was 8.65 million yuan, and double horse yarn was 7.85 million yuan, both reaching unprecedented highs. However, the trend of 42-count fine yarn was relatively sluggish. Blue Phoenix yarn rose by 450,000 yuan from the previous day to 13.65 million yuan. 20-count and 16-count yarn both rose by 300,000 to 500,000 yuan.

Yesterday, the cotton cloth market initially softened, because it was the weekend and the end of the month, and many floating traders were selling, and the start of spinning construction provided ample chips. The low price of 12-pound dragon head fine cloth was 325,000 yuan, but it was absorbed by the industry at a low price, and the actual needs of the customers were strong, so the price rose again. Finally, the price of dragon head fine cloth returned to 337,000 yuan, and the price of Wufu fine cloth was 320,000 yuan, continuing to rise from 7,000 yuan to 10,000 yuan compared to the previous day. The prices of fine cloths such as Caqiu, Blue Chicken, Yulong, and ABC also rose from 5,000 yuan to 10,000 yuan. Bleached cloth sold well, rising by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan. The prices of other coarse cloth, blue cloth, and shilin cloth all rose by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan to 20,000 to 30,000 yuan.

### Side View of the Tenth Meeting of the Jiangxi Provincial Council: Eighteen Councilors Verbally Interrogated Continuously Like a Barrage Without a Minute of Intermission

— Nanchang Dispatch, 24th - Qian Ming

On May 21st, the Jiangxi Provincial Council held its tenth meeting, with Civil Affairs Director Li Zhongxiang giving a policy report. After the report, over ten councilors, including Tao Han, made verbal inquiries one after another. The intensity and tension of the situation were unprecedented in previous meetings. After Mr. Li left the meeting, eleven councilors, including Tao Han, immediately made a temporary motion, stating that Director Li was suspected of dereliction of duty and should be requested by letter from the provincial government and submitted to the Executive Yuan for investigation. Due to the short time, it was hastily passed. The detailed report of the meeting before and after is as follows:

Sudden Tension in the Conference Hall

Although it was early summer, the weather that day (the 21st) was even more sweltering than the dog days of summer. In the morning, the Jiangxi Provincial Council conference hall was already full of seventy or eighty councilors, guests, and reporters, and the air seemed even more sweltering. In this sweltering atmosphere, the expressions on the faces of over ten councilors were unusually tense. For the sensitive group of reporters, it seemed that they had a premonition that this meeting would not be very ordinary? Perhaps there would be exciting scenes? Everyone was welcoming the upcoming scene with nervous anticipation!

At 9:20 AM, Director Li was invited to the reporting platform to give a policy report. He gave a concise summary of the general business of the civil affairs department in various aspects, seemingly intending to leave more time for the councilors to ask questions.

After the report, many councilors stood up to speak, and the air suddenly became tense. The first to raise questions was councilor Tao Han from Jinxian. He said that Director Li had the intention of establishing factions, citing the following reasons: In recent months, the director's inspection tours seemed to have the intention of arranging elections. Secondly, he said that the township chief examination held by the Jinxian County Government this month was also related to the future elections. Thirdly, he said that his fellow villager Hu Yi (his political opponent) riding in the director's car back to the county was also illegal. When he mentioned the name Hu Yi, he seemed to have a deep hatred. Finally, he specifically explained that he had a thirty-year friendship with the director, but he would not abandon public duty for private reasons, so he gave a special word of advice. Saying this, his expression seemed to have a spirit of self-sacrifice for the sake of justice. Following Tao Han's speech were councilors Du Longyuan, Yuan Risheng, Huang Shangyuan, and Hu Dingguo. Councilor Du questioned why the corrupt Zhu Wenhua was transferred from Wan'an to Suichuan. Councilor Yuan questioned why the section chiefs and secretaries were also changed when the county magistrate changed. Councilor Huang said, why should An'yi County use someone nearly 70 years old as the secretary of the council? Councilor Hu said that the county magistrate of Xinyu County had no political acumen. After that, councilors Peng Xuezhan, Liu Guanghan, Lin Fumin, Huang Fang, Xiong Zaichi, Liu Renqiu, Xu Xiacheng, Tu Gang, and Yan Jizhi continued to speak. Councilor Peng gave opinions on the qualifications of the county magistrate and future elections. Councilor Huang, in addition to making suggestions on township production, the term of office of township chiefs, and household administration, specifically raised a question saying that Director Li was coming to take on the position of director in the capacity of a member of the Central Committee. It was rumored that he was here to arrange elections. Councilor Xiong hoped that Director Li would take a fair position to benefit Jiangxi. Councilor Xu said in a tone of emotion that Director Li now had the phenomenon of "being deserted by his followers."

Eighteen People Fire a Barrage

Amid the inquiries of the eighteen councilors rising one after another, Director Li stood on the reporting platform, listening attentively throughout. He smiled from time to time. Especially when he heard the words "Hu Yi riding in his car is illegal," "Why use someone nearly 70 years old as the county council secretary," and "Take on the position of director in the capacity of a member of the Central Committee." The eighteen people's continuous verbal inquiries were like a barrage, without a minute of intermission. Director Li began to answer each question. When he was giving his policy report, he had already spent part of the time, and the continuous verbal inquiries of the eighteen councilors occupied almost all of the prescribed time, so he had to give concise answers when answering. But just as he was about to talk about the election issue, the chairman rang the bell to urge him to finish. Although it was extended by five minutes, the answer to the question still could not be fully expressed. First, he said: "The performance evaluation of the county magistrate is jointly assessed by various departments, including education and construction. As for the recent inspection tours, they are in accordance with the regulations of the Ministry of the Interior, which require inspection tours every quarter. As for township production, attention has long been paid to preventing apportionment." Just as he was saying this, Vice Chairman Wang said: "There is no need to answer one by one, please give a general summary answer." So Director Li continued to say about the election, he said, "The rumors you just heard are completely unfounded. The central government has not yet issued all the election regulations, and even the organization in charge of the election has not been clearly instructed. How can we talk about manipulating things?" Just as Director Li was about to continue speaking, Councilor Ding Dinan suddenly slapped the table and shouted: "The students of Zhongzheng University who are petitioning have already crossed the Zhongzheng Bridge and killed people. What are we still listening to the answer to the civil affairs inquiry? We want to discuss emergency measures. Please have the Civil Affairs Department use a written report." Vice Chairman Wang also shouted repeatedly: "Use a written report, use a written report!" Director Li said, "Okay, I will use a written report, but don't say that there are problems that are not answered in person." So he withdrew from the meeting and walked towards the door.

A Magic Trick, Pass the Motion

Suddenly someone shouted, "Close the door!" Some councilors did not know what was happening and immediately left the meeting. The door of the meeting hall was then closed. The chairman ordered the police to stand inside the door and took out a piece of paper with words on it. His hands were shaking non-stop, and he said in a trembling voice: "Now there is an emergency proposal regarding the students of Zhongzheng University marching and petitioning." Everyone listened quietly, but what Vice Chairman Wang read tremblingly was: "Director Li Zhongxiang of the Civil Affairs Department has abused his power since taking office, established factions, attempted to manipulate elections, created local disputes, facilitated private gains, excluded dissidents, and protected corruption. The facts of various illegal and derelict behaviors have been listed by the councilors today and questioned face to face. Such obvious bad deeds are indeed unworthy of his position. A letter should be sent to the provincial government and submitted to the Executive Yuan for strict investigation in order to warn corrupt officials and rectify the political climate. Is this appropriate? Please decide publicly!" Proposers: Tao Han, Yang Suochuan, Liu! Dong, Li Zhongding, Xu Xiacheng. Lin Demin, Hu Ding, Zeng Zhaochang, Hua Renqiu, Xiong Zaichi, Yang Yinguang.

At this time, five or six people in the councilor seats suddenly shouted, passing it without objection. The door was opened at this time, and everyone went out one after another. This motion "to warn corrupt officials and rectify the political climate" was passed. The news immediately spread throughout Nanchang City. In order to clarify the facts, reporters visited many provincial councilors. They told me that many councilors were deeply dissatisfied with the proposal and passage of this case in such a magical way and had initiated a signature campaign to request a review. That evening, I visited Director Li Zhongxiang to inquire about his attitude towards the motion passed by the Provincial Council.

Director Li's Humorous Tone Director Li refused to answer any questions about the meeting situation and the motion after he left. He said, "I have nothing to say. The people's eyes are sharp. Everything will be left to the central government and public opinion." When talking about the situation during the inquiry, it aroused his words. He said: I have been a member of the National Political Council for eight years, and I have also attended countless meetings, but I have never encountered today's situation. A series of eighteen obvious inquiries were asked without interruption, and the answering time was so short that I could not even speak. … As for those inquiries, some are very good, but some are extremely abstract. How can I answer them? As for saying that I am trying to manipulate the election, where does this start? I don’t even know how to elect, so how can I talk about "trying to manipulate"? How abstract the words "trying" are!" Finally, he said in a humorous tone, "Think about it, a friend riding in my car is also illegal, my inspection tours to various counties are also illegal, and it is not okay to use someone in their seventies as the council secretary of An'yi County. Moreover, the council secretary is recommended by the county magistrate. Think about it! There is also a gentleman who said that I am "deserted by my followers." I don't understand what "followers" and "relatives" refer to? What is a relative? What is a follower? In my mind, there are only the old folks of Jiangxi. When I returned to the province last year, I was originally determined to serve my hometown and do things for the old folks." Saying this, his attitude and tone seemed very heavy and serious.

### The Situation of Pacification in Northern Jiangsu

— By our correspondent Wang Han'ou, reporting from the 24th

A month ago, the news from Northern Jiangsu was very bad, especially in Shanghai and Nanjing, where rumors spread that even Xinghua and Yancheng had fallen. Not many days later, the rumors dispelled themselves. Except for some harassment by remnants of the communists in the coastal townships, there was no truth to the reports of the fall of Xinghua and Yancheng. Northern Jiangsu is close to Shanghai and Nanjing, and its safety is of particular concern to friends in the Jiangnan region. A special report follows:

The Green Curtain Fades, Communist Guerrilla Activity Diminishes

The situation in Northern Jiangsu is like having scabies, covered in bumps. Remnants of the communists harass the villages, and "underground fighters" create rumors in the cities, moving around and disrupting the people's lives. However, the destructive activities of the communist remnants can only cause irritation like scabies, not a fiery pain. They do not seem to have the strength to fight the Nationalists for cities and land at the moment. Currently, except for the unfortunate occupation of Dazhongji in Dongtai, the communist remnants were utterly defeated by the Nationalist troops in other battles such as Libao and Jugang. Recently, the communists seem to be preserving their strength and have temporarily changed their harassment plans. There have been no "alerts" in various towns for many days. As the wheat harvest begins, the green curtain of crops will soon be completely removed, and the communist army's chance for a "major counter-offensive" on the coast has been lost invisibly!

Weak Self-Defense, People Eagerly Await Reinforcements

The Nationalist forces in Northern Jiangsu are not numerous enough to be stationed in every city and village. The self-defense forces are also weak and dare not defend the villages alone. The work of suppressing the communists is not being done well, allowing them to kill, set fires, create terror in the villages, undermine the morale of the farmers, and hinder the advancement of pacification policies. Recently, many good citizens in the villages, fearing the cruelty of the communist cadres and the possibility of misfortune, have been abandoning their homes and fleeing. Undoubtedly, this year's agricultural productivity in Northern Jiangsu will be significantly lower than in previous years, which is a hidden worry for the future of Northern Jiangsu. The local people's opinion is that unless the government increases its suppression efforts and establishes a solid foundation for the advancement of pacification policies, the people of Northern Jiangsu will not be able to obtain a stable life.

Commander Inspects, Issues Instructions on Pacification Military Affairs

Commander Li, the head of the First Pacification Zone, went to Rugao and Taixing counties the day before yesterday to inspect and make arrangements and issue instructions regarding local pacification military affairs. It is generally expected that as the wheat harvest approaches, the Nationalist troops will mobilize to protect the farmers' wheat harvest and rice planting to stabilize the lives of the people of Northern Jiangsu. The communist remnants will also inevitably try to seize "public grain," and there will be several fierce battles. The reporter interviewed Deputy Division Commander Wang Kejun of the garrison troops, who provided a very detailed account of the pacification situation in Northern Jiangsu. Deputy Division Commander Wang is very talkative and has the demeanor of a Confucian general. He reads "Shen Bao" and local newspapers from various places every day and has a good understanding of news theory. He said, "Recently, we found communist newspapers. Although they are full of distorted propaganda, the writing is popular and vivid, and the descriptions are realistic, making it easy for people to mistake falsehood for truth and be deceived. Although our newspapers report the truth accurately, they may not be as effective at times!" The reporter said, "Our comprehensive news section aims to be vivid and engaging." He said, "I've seen it, the content is very good!"

Land Policy, Being Implemented in Various Counties

Because the communist remnants continue to wreak havoc in the countryside, the land policy to improve the lives of farmers in Northern Jiangsu has not been thoroughly implemented as planned. The governments of Nantong, Taixian, Rugao, and Kunshan have now established land rights clearing committees and mediation committees, formulated methods for managing land registration, and implemented the "3-7 rent reduction." However, because the communist remnants in the rural areas have not been eliminated and the administration cannot be fully implemented locally, most counties are first conducting trials in sections of areas controlled by the government to see the results. In addition, the heavy burden on the people in the townships and frequent local levies are the biggest source of suffering for the people in the pacification zone. Local county governments are currently drafting a plan for unified management of income and expenditure, starting to abolish redundant agencies, and reducing levies. Several counties in Northern Jiangsu have already achieved effective results. The Rugao County Government convened a county government meeting the day before yesterday, and the first issue was to plan for unified management of income and expenditure to reduce the burden on the people.

### Regarding the 800,000 Hong Kong Dollar Fraud Case

(Statement from the Yongxing Trading Company)

We have recently received a letter from the French Yongxing Trading Company at 95 Huqiu Road in this city stating: "The news about the 'Hong Kong Yongxing Trading Company' on page seven of your newspaper on the 29th was quite detailed. Our company also has a branch in Hong Kong, which could easily cause a misunderstanding among your newspaper's many readers in various locations, leading them to believe that the Yongxing Trading Company that went bankrupt in Hong Kong is our Hong Kong branch. We hereby issue an urgent statement: That Yongxing Trading Company is an organization in Hong Kong that uses our company's Chinese name and is not the 'French Yongxing Trading Company in Hong Kong.'" We are publishing the above statement as is.

### Fire Hydrant in Nanshi Needs Repair

Dear Editor: There is a fire hydrant at the end of Penglai Road in Nanshi that has been damaged due to years of disrepair, causing water to flow out every day, wetting the streets and causing inconvenience to pedestrians. Moreover, many residents nearby fetch water from it, often leading to quarrels and fights. We hope that the relevant authorities will send someone to repair it as soon as possible. (Sun Zhiting, resident of Penglai Road)

### Pang Bingxun Retires to the Longhai Garden

— By our reporter Fan Shiqin, reporting from Zhengzhou on the 25th via airmail

Although Pang Bingxun does not yet appear to be senile, his heavy ears and rambling speech indicate some aging. He is like his aging years among the contemporary figures. Using him as a news figure today is like inserting a faded flower into a vase. However, his relationship with northern Henan today still makes him worthy of attention. General Commander Gu Mosan of the Army Headquarters values him quite a bit, and during the recent tension in Xinxiang, he sent someone to bring him to the Longhai Garden in Zhengzhou for rest.

The people of Henan Province, especially the people of northern Henan today, easily think of him not because he has been in Henan for many years, but because his old troops are still surrounded in Anyang, fighting alone; and his second son, Qingzhen, has just led a regiment to Anyang to reinforce them. When talking to him about his old troops defending Anyang, he will talk to you in detail non-stop. He said that Li Zhenqing, the commander of the 40th Division, has been with him since the ninth year of the Republic, how he suppressed bandits in northern Henan in the 22nd and 23rd years, how he defeated the Sakagaki 5th Division in the Linyi area during the Anti-Japanese War, opening the prelude to the victory of the Anti-Japanese War; how he annihilated an enemy brigade in the Zhangyuan campaign, as well as the situations in Zhuxian Town and the Taihang Mountains; and how he covered the safe retreat of Commander Jiang Dingwen in the Luoyang area in the 33rd year. Like an old woman talking about family matters, it is quite interesting.

Commander Li is from Shandong, but he is not tall, but his face is dark and his muscles are tight, which is quite consistent with his nickname "Li Iron Head." His method of leading troops still maintains the style of Feng Yuxiang. A new recruit must first learn three characters on the first day, one hundred characters within three months, be able to write family letters in half a year, and keep a diary in one year. He himself also hired a Hanlin scholar named Du as a teacher in Bo'ai, and there are always several erudite scholars teaching him books. "No sound of gunfire is the sound of reading," is a slogan in his army that is enough to make people proud. In the 30th and 31st years, this army was very prominent and was considered the best army in the country by the inspection team. At that time, even Tang Enbo's army had organized a visiting group, which studied in that army for more than a month. The two sets of tricks played by his soldiers amazed the visiting group. One set was flying over eaves and walking on walls to reach the building; the other set was shooting at distant trenches with a moving target. That army still does not forget Feng Yuxiang's old tune: "Be good citizens at home, be good soldiers in the army;" "Promote old morals, instill new knowledge." So Pang Bingxun always said with a smile: "None of my officials and soldiers have become communists."

Commander Li has been defending Anyang alone, fighting bloody battles with Liu Bocheng's 60,000 troops for more than 20 days, and still stands firm, and has broken Liu Bocheng's boast of taking Anyang within three weeks. It is really not accidental.

After Pang Bingxun talked about his subordinates, he talked about his friend Sun Dianying. Regarding Liu Bocheng's frustration in attacking Tangyin, he feigned a retreat of dozens of miles, but Sun did not take it as a plan, allowing the people in the city to enter and exit, so that the communists mixed into it, destroyed the generator, the electric network failed, and the city fell. He was quite regretful.

Zhengzhou is full of wind and sand, but Longhai Garden relies on lush green trees and is still a quiet corner. Pang reads newspapers and writes books every day, which is also a peaceful place for him. He is no longer a new figure today, and what he talks about is ordinary, not as popular as those who advocate peace today. However, his old troops are guarding a key point in the border area of Jin, Hebei, Lu, and Yu, and he exchanges letters and telegrams with them every day. This makes him still provide a supplement in today's historical materials.

Spring and Autumn

### Renaissance and Social Transformation

— Lecture by Dr. Gu Yiqiao, recorded by Shen Chengru and Chen Yonglin

I remember when I was in Chongqing, I wrote an article discussing the national revival movements of various countries. According to European precedents, national revival movements include the Renaissance, the Reformation, and the Great Political Revolution.

In the case of India, the poet Tagore advocated that to save India, it is necessary to save the soul of India, that is, to make India also have a Renaissance. When the Renaissance of India is completed, India will be able to get rid of the rule of the British Empire. Therefore, he advocated "choosing the standard of culture, not in the new and old, but in the spiritual value contained in this culture." He often taught the students in the International University he founded to sing the poems he wrote in Bengali. He has created more than 2,500 musical scores, which have made great contributions to Indian music. The paintings of the Academy of Art of the International University have formed their own school. On the one hand, it preserves the inherent artistic spirit of India, and on the other hand, it absorbs the strengths of the art of various countries, especially Chinese painting - its murals are especially famous. In addition, Indian dance is also highly appreciated.

Because Tagore's proposition was like this, it was not without differences from Gandhi's opinions. Gandhi believed that if the Indian nation wanted to be revived, regardless of bloodshed or not, it must first be liberated from the British Empire - political reform first - to be successful, otherwise the Renaissance would be meaningless. But Tagore believed that as long as the Renaissance is done first, India can be independent. However, in his later years, after being taught by reality, he agreed with Gandhi's statement, which can be seen in his later works.

But the Indian national revolution is difficult, the biggest obstacle is that there are too many religions in India, in addition to the Hinduism we are familiar with (accounting for 68.5% of the total population) and Islam (21.7%), there are also Buddhism, Jainism, Sikhism, Christianity, etc., about twenty or thirty kinds, and these religions are incompatible with each other, so it is indeed very difficult to unify and independence India. In addition, the class concept of Indian society is very deep, and Gandhi also wanted to break these boundaries. The untouchables in India have no clothes to wear, they only wear a piece of cloth, the untouchables have no shoes to wear, and he also walks barefoot, the untouchables cannot afford hats, and he is bald, which is the performance of his desire to break these boundaries.

Once he fasted for three weeks, and in the second week, his doctor Luo Yi said to the friends who approached him that he was going to die, but on the fifteenth day, his confidence recovered and said: God wants me to live, I still have to work for India. So after he made the prayers of Islam, Hinduism, Christianity and his own poems, he ate again. He is really a saint, and it is not enough to call him Mahatma, he can be said to be the Sakyamuni of modern India.

Therefore, the revival of India first took the road of Renaissance, the political reform has not been completed, and the religious revolution is being done.

Our national revival movement started with Sun Yat-sen's revolution, and it has been about sixty years now, has it been successful? No! The Renaissance is just the opposite of India, lagging behind, starting from the May Fourth Movement, and has not succeeded yet. Of course, we admit that literary and artistic workers have made many contributions, but how many of our works have a place in the international community, what about our paintings, music, and dance? From these aspects, we are not as good as India, India's difficulty lies in the religious revolution, and what we are doing is not a religious revolution, but a social transformation movement.

The Renaissance is not just a matter for those of us who write, and political reform is not just a matter for the government and political parties, these are matters for the majority of people, and should be participated in by the majority of people. Therefore, it is useless to complain about the government for being dissatisfied with the status quo, to complain about foreigners for invading us, and even to complain about individuals. The most important thing is to stand up yourself. If you can stand up yourself, everything can be solved. And to stand up yourself, this society needs to be transformed, otherwise it will be useless no matter how you advocate democratic politics or popularize education.

However, whether it is political reform or social transformation, the most fundamental problem is still economic. If the economic situation improves, there will be other ways. If a writer is bothered every day, how can there be any good works?

Speaking of economy, the economic revival of China depends on the farmers who account for more than 80% of the total population. If the farmers are not exploited, not oppressed, and their living conditions improve, there will be ways for other industries and commerce, otherwise it is unimaginable that 400 million people are starving and the other 50 million can survive.

The road of social transformation in China in the future is either riot or peace. We don't talk about thoughts, doctrines, etc., just ask him how he treats the common people. If we have a way to make more than 80% of the people have enough food and clothing, stand up, then everything else will be solved.

If China can be revived, India will also be revived. If the two nations of China and India, which account for almost half of the world's population, can "rely on their own efforts," then the so-called two major opposing blocs may stop fighting. Britain now promises India autonomy because it is afraid that India will lean towards the Soviet Union. If China is revived, it will not need to beg for help from others. Who would not be willing to be friends with China?

We have fought this eight-year war, and we have to ask the old people whether they can bear it if we still use riots to reform society. Social transformation is a great cause, and it needs everyone to study, suggest, and implement it, and then it can save the nation and the country. (Lecture at the Literary and Art Tea Party on May 18)

### Artists of Huangshan

— Yu Jianhua

Huangshan is the most suitable mountain for painting Chinese landscape paintings among the famous mountains in China, because it has the majestic and great Tiandu and Lianhua, and the strange and beautiful Shixinfeng; and the vastness of the sea of clouds and the weirdness of the West Sea are beyond people's expectations. Huangshan is infinitely variable, so the manuscript taken is also infinitely rich. Ancient and modern calligraphers, who can take a hill, a valley, a peak, and a pine tree, are enough to be famous at that time and passed down to future generations. For example, the masters of the Qing Dynasty, Shi Tao, Mei Qushan, Mei Luye, and Jianjiang, all became famous for writing about Huangshan. There are many modern painters who paint Huangshan, such as Zhang Daqian, Qian Shoutie, and Chen Xiaodie, among others. In recent years, there has been a Huangshan school of painting. I have also traveled to Huangshan twice to paint the mountain spirits; as for the Huangshan people who write Huangshan, there are Huang Binhong, Wang Caibai, and Xu Shiqi. Binhong is over eighty years old and lives in Beijing. The Huangshan he paints is often not very similar; like Xiang Jiu Fangbao's horse, it must be appreciated outside the mares and blacks and yellows. The Huangshan painted by Caibai has smooth brush and ink, and the color is gentle and beautiful, neither close nor far, and both form and spirit are similar. Shiqi loved art since he was a child, and he had already inherited the aura of famous mountains. When he grew up, he studied hard and integrated Chinese and Western painting in one furnace; he traveled extensively in Europe, watched art in Paris, and had already entered the hall and entered the room of Western painting, and exhausted its mysteries. After returning to China, he specialized in national books, and was proficient in flowers, birds, figures, and landscapes. Especially the landscapes he paints are not limited to Huangshan; and the strange pines and strange peaks are nowhere unlike Huangshan. This is probably because what he inherited is thick, and what he has is deep, so he can naturally reveal it, and all of them portray the spirit of Huangshan. After returning from victory, Brother Shiqi founded the Huangshan Art Garden in Shanghai, with elegant toothpicks and jade axes. There are often three or five like-minded people who talk about poetry and painting, and when they are free, they hold pens and dip in ink, and work hard in research day and night. The number of scholars who follow him is also increasing day by day. Huangshan people paint Huangshan, and run the Huangshan Art Garden. The mountain is important to people, and people are named after the mountain. I know that the revival of the Huangshan School is just around the corner. Brother Shiqi recently displayed his masterpieces at the China Science Society on Shaanxi South Road. Many people who love Huangshan in Shanghai will surely be able to feast their eyes.

### Introducing Ms. Xiao Shufang's Painting Exhibition

— Cao Weifeng

I can't paint, I can't express objective opinions about painting, and I don't have any insider's view, but I like to look at paintings. My liking for paintings, like my interest in sculpture and listening to music, is just an amateur hobby. In recent years, whenever there is a painting exhibition, as long as my time permits, I always want to see it; I also never miss the opportunity to visit those museums and art galleries in Europe. Over time, I seem to have some opinions about a painting, a sculpture, or a piece of music, but I know that these are all amateur opinions.

The creative activities of all arts, in the mental activities of the creators and in the process of their creation, are exactly the same. Music is like this, literature is like this, and painting is also like this. The only difference is the difference in tools. In Western painting, like Western literature, in my opinion, they are all progressing according to the three stages of classical, romantic, and realistic. It seems that it is also the case in music; because Westerners have indeed had this kind of evolution in their minds in the past few hundred years.

In the creative life of an art creation, there are also several processes. The learning period is not counted. Afterwards, we can also divide it into three stages: the first is the technical, the second is the creative, and the third is the genius. These three terms are my own inventions. In the technical period, the creator cultivates his expression tools with all his strength. He imitates, he practices, and he works tirelessly. In this period, hand training is more important than everything else, and mental activity is brewing, lying dormant, and cultivating its depth and breadth.

In the second period, the characteristics of personality appear. People engaged in artistic creation must reach this stage to be able to form their own school. As for reaching the third stage, it is something that can be met but not sought. Among the many painters in ancient and modern times, there are not many genius masters who can be the founders of a school and use their creations as the permanent spiritual comfort of mankind.

Due to the conditions of life, environment, cultivation, etc., many practitioners are always stagnant in the first stage, which is really a very regrettable phenomenon. The reason for this, in my estimation, is that although the technique has reached its peak, the spiritual cultivation has not yet reached the corresponding level. Creation requires a deeper understanding than superficial observation, no matter how hard you work or how meticulous you are, it is not enough. As for reaching the third stage from the second stage, it requires life experience and a broader sympathy.

The above statement is my own understanding, and it is inevitable that there will be amateur opinions. But one thing is, it doesn't really matter what the final achievement of the art creator is, the most important thing is whether he is always in progress.

Shufang is a good friend, and criticism of good and bad should be done in person for good friends. As for what can be introduced to the general public, I can say that this is a painter who is always progressing.

When I first met Xinen and Shufang, I only knew that Brother Xinen was the eldest son of Mr. Yu Rizhang and was a doctor; Shufang was the niece of Mr. Xiao Youxiang and was a virtuous housewife, but I didn't know that this couple each had a specialty. Xinen's articles are as delicate as his surgical operations, and Shufang's paintings are just like her, bright and elegant.

When Shufang held a painting exhibition in London, I didn't have time to go, but I only knew that it was highly praised by the people there. This painting exhibition could have been held a few years earlier, but because of the war and because she was sick for several years, she had to postpone it to now. There are old works in it, but there are more new works. In her Chinese paintings, I like her small pieces. In her oil paintings, I hope that people who go to see it will pay special attention to the landscape paintings of Switzerland and Peiping.

(Ms. Xiao's painting exhibition will be held at the Shanghai YMCA at Baxianqiao from June 1st to 7th)

### After Visiting Ms. Zhang Liying's Art Exhibition - On the Future of Chinese Oil Painting

— Sun Fuxi

Ms. Zhang Liying held a meeting in Shanghai before going to the United States to exhibit her oil paintings and calligraphy to bid farewell to her fellow countrymen. This is of great significance to Chinese art.

It has been at least fifty years since the Chinese began learning Western oil painting. Initially, they merely followed step by step, not only imitating Western methods and subjects but also using Western goods for all materials, including tools, pigments, and canvases. Therefore, the transplanted oil painting ultimately failed to take root and flourish in the fertile soil of China, with no significant achievements for either the artists or the appreciators.

Unfortunately, Westerners excessively admired ancient Chinese paintings and even promoted the imitation of recent works of ancient paintings.

Coincidentally, the War of Resistance against Japan began, making it impossible to transport oil painting materials. Exhibitions of works imitating ancient Chinese paintings were held, which were more profitable and helped maintain livelihoods. As a result, the roots of oil painting almost withered.

Ms. Zhang Liying is well-versed in European art. The depth of her foundation in painting may not be fully believed by the general public, but those who have a slight understanding can distinguish the level of her skill, which is not as difficult to discern as in Chinese paintings. It is admirable enough that she uses her profound skill to express the unique beauty of China's reality. Moreover, at a time when oil painting is declining, she perseveres and bravely calls out, demonstrating a foresight and courage that ordinary painters cannot match.

Among the exhibited works, the landscape paintings such as "Hong Kong Harbor View" and "Jiaxing Blood Imprint Temple" are able to depict the climate, customs, mythology, philosophy... of China vividly. Moreover, they use folk themes, carefully composing figures and casually embellishing still lifes to fully convey the beauty of Chinese society. Few Chinese painters have done this kind of work and achieved such results. Only a few Westerners have done this kind of sketching in China and exhibited it in Europe and America, but their understanding and selection of themes are never as insightful as those of Chinese painters.

There are many beautiful subjects in Chinese scenery and human affairs. Ms. Zhang Liying will surely supplement them as much as possible before going abroad, making them more perfect.

In the past, Chinese painters mostly depicted the beauty of ancient traditions. Ms. Zhang Liying is the most powerful pioneer in using oil painting to express the beauty of modern China, for which all artists in the world are grateful.

If one artistic trip can revive the trend of Chinese oil painting, it will be of even greater significance to Chinese art.

### The Generation of Art

— Yu

The real world is flawed, and people long for an ideal world, idealizing all that is perfect. Thus, "form" and "spirit" are separated. Although our physical bodies cannot transcend reality or make up for flaws, our spirits can be free from the limitations of reality and leap into another transcendent, ideal, and perfect world. This is the origin of imagination, and art is its first product.

### An Inch of Land, An Inch of Blood 523

— Ye Jingfeng

In less than three minutes, the two had crossed the wasteland and reached the foot of the wall of the nest. Along the way, they not only did not encounter any hidden posts or obstacles, but also the crows cawing on the roof of the nest and the searchlight movements had stopped long ago. There was even no sound of human voices.

Shouyi, seeing this situation, felt a bit uncertain in his heart, but because he was "highly skilled and insightful," he only hesitated for a moment before giving a signal to Hejian, who was five or six yards away. Shouyi stretched out his hands, grabbed the wall, and with a single movement, his whole body was on top of the wall. On the wall, besides some ivy that had been climbing for years and some moss, there were no facilities such as broken glass or electric current. (Originally, this was a long-closed Western-style villa. The owner had left, the location was not good, no one rented it, and it was abandoned here. Unexpectedly, these urban foxes and shrine rats had made it their nest.)

Shouyi lay on the wall, shading his eyes, and carefully observed for a while. He saw that the lights in the small Western-style building, which was ten or so yards away, were off and there was no movement. The weak light from the street lamps dozens of yards away shone on the doors and windows of the nest, outlining the shape of the building, a three-bay, three-story old-fashioned Western-style house. Shouyi was very suspicious, so he signaled Hejian to come up the wall. Hejian was, of course, also agile. Seeing Shouyi's signal, he knew that there was no need to lie in wait at the foot of the wall, so he jumped up and lay on the wall, forming a two-dragons-playing-with-a-pearl pose with Shouyi.

"Old He," Shouyi said softly, "I think the house is empty. We can go down and check it out! We have to be careful of booby traps and the like. Maybe there are still one or two hidden posts lurking."

"You lead the way, brother," Hejian said politely.

The two explored step by step, searching along the way, but found nothing. When they reached the stone steps, they only heard Shouyi say "shi" and then laugh "chi."

"What?" Hejian whispered, still very cautious.

"I'll tell you later... These mischievous guys are really fooling around..." Shouyi said, then quickened his pace and rushed to the open door. He reached out to touch the light switch by the door, but saw that the switch was still on, but there was no light. He knew that those guys had probably cut off the main power line before leaving.

Shouyi told Hejian to wait for a while and that he would be right back. Shouyi groped his way in, and in less than a minute or two, the house suddenly lit up. Shouyi also walked over with a smile:

"The devils only turned off the main power switch, they didn't damage it."

"That's pretty smart... I'm afraid they left it to come back again!" Hejian sneered.

Before the two started to check, fearing that there might be hidden posts, they first went outside, walking along the wall, small bushes, tree roots, etc. When they reached the back gate, Shouyi seemed to have seen something again, said "oh" and laughed "chi" again.

"What?" Hejian asked again.

"Look?" Shouyi pointed to the back door frame and told Hejian to look.

Using the light from inside the house, Hejian looked closely at the spot pointed out by Shouyi. He saw only some crayon-like things, lines of various colors drawn horizontally and vertically;

"Is it some kind of symbol?" Hejian guessed.

"That's right!" Shouyi replied with a smile. There was no time to explain in detail now, but in short, all four mischievous guys had been here...

### Mr. Xu Shiqi's Preliminary Exhibition and a Poem in Response

— Zhu Yingpeng

You live in the Yellow Mountains, and excel at painting Yellow Mountain pines;
Bold and with many unique forms, conveying a spirit that defies winter.
After a long separation due to war, it's like a reunion after a lifetime;
In your small studio (you have established the Yellow Mountain Art Studio at your residence), ink and brush are still used with elegance.
The disaster in Shandong is not yet over, and a hundred worries fill my heart;
The Six Canons of Painting are like the creation of nature itself, inspiring courage and transforming the stubborn and mediocre.
At the rooster's crow in a night of wind and rain, our path is not fixed;
Strive to follow the footsteps of our predecessors, and revive the Xin'an School.

### Pine Peak Hanging Waterfall

— Xu Shiqi

### A Poem Presented to Mr. Xu Shiqi's Art Exhibition

— Shi Chongpeng

I heard that Dao Xuan wielded his brush with divine skill,
Painting a thousand miles of Jialing River in a single day.
Painters have always learned from nature,
And Wang Wei wrote of the Wang River after retiring to the countryside.
The mountains and rivers of Fuchun are rich in color,
And Huang Gongwang's true works seem like immortals.
Of all the famous mountains under heaven, the Five Sacred Mountains are majestic,
But none are as beautiful as the ravines and valleys of the Yellow Mountains!
The pine forests rustle, echoing in the empty valleys,
And the sea of clouds is vast after the rain.
My friend Xu Shiqi of Xin'an,
Wields his brush in high spirits, creating clouds and mist.
Not following the ruts and clichés of his predecessors,
He hangs his hometown on the wall.
His talent is naturally different from the masses,
His brush contains the power of a flying waterfall.
Do not ask about the Southern or Northern School,
His divine charm is naturally profound and rooted.
Reading your paintings, I am surprised and amazed,
And ashamed that I am not as good as you, filled with self-pity.
If Wang Wei and Wu Daozi were to come,
They could travel thousands of miles in this small space.

### White Elephant (Continued)

— Feng Zikai

One day, White Elephant didn't come back for lunch. "Could it be that it went to the temple to find someone to hang out with again?" everyone wondered. By nightfall, it still hadn't returned. Xiuying went to the temple that night to look for it, but couldn't find it. The next day, it still didn't come back. The problem became serious, so I wrote two posters: "Lost: One white cat with sun and moon eyes. Any kind person who finds and returns it will be rewarded with 100,000 yuan in legal currency. Funds are reserved and will not be reneged. ×× Road ×× Number Sincerely." Two days later, a neighbor came and said, "A few days ago, I saw a big white cat dead in the pond between the Dizang Nunnery and the Fuxing Bookstore. I'm afraid it's yours." We hastily went to mourn, but couldn't find the body. We asked the police in the Dizang Nunnery, but they said they didn't know and that the sanitation workers probably took it away. We went home, everyone silently mourned, and then discussed the cause of its death. Some said that it accidentally fell into the water, others said that mischievous kids pushed it in. No one could agree. Later, Xinmei reported that a neighbor's child had seen a big white cat dead on the roots of the big willow tree in the pond and that it had been kicked into the pond. Children don't lie, so this theory is probably reliable. Moreover, I've heard that cats don't want to die at home. Knowing that their end is near, they must travel far to a deserted place before passing away. Therefore, this theory seems even more reliable. I think this bit of "cat nature" is quite admirable. It has the spirit of a hero who doesn't want to die in the hands of women and children but prefers to die on the battlefield, wrapped in horse hide. It also has the spirit of a recluse who doesn't want to die in bed but prefers to disappear into the deep mountains, never to be seen again. In short, White Elephant is definitely no longer in the "Dusty World"!

The day after White Elephant disappeared, Mr. Lin came to Hangzhou from Shanghai. As soon as he arrived, he first asked about White Elephant. Upon hearing the news, he was shocked. Because she was originally entrusted by Old Mrs. Duan to bring White Elephant back to Shanghai and return it to its old owner. Only a day apart, what a twist of fate! However, Heaven had its reasons. Fortunately, it had three orphans, which, although not sun and moon eyed, are strong and lively enough to inherit the bloodline. To prevent loss, I specifically entrusted one of the four small calico cats to my friend's house. The other two small calico cats are always by my side. Whenever I put up my feet to read the newspaper or drink wine, they climb on my feet, one high and one low, one moving and one still. Everyone who sees it laughs. I've already become accustomed to it. It seems that the moment I sit down, there are naturally two kittens on my feet. Written on May 27th, the 36th year of the Republic, in Hangzhou.

### The Authenticity of the Tanaka Memorial

— Bao Qing

The concrete strategies for Japan's past two-pronged invasion—maritime and continental policies—originated from the Tanaka Memorial. Our Ministry of Foreign Affairs, after verifying the facts against this scheme, found that they matched perfectly. It cannot but regard the Memorial as a concrete manifestation of Japan's true policy towards China. However, Japan has consistently denied the existence of the Memorial. Thus, the issue of the Memorial's authenticity has become a major disputed issue between China and Japan.

When General Qin Decun testified at the International Military Tribunal for the Far East, the first thing the defense lawyers refused to let go of was his mention of the Tanaka Memorial in his written statement. Prior to this, Okada Keisuke's testimony on July 2 stated: "Tanaka probably wanted to develop in Manchuria first, and then gradually advance peacefully into mainland China. Also, in 1927, there was a strong desire within the Army Ministry to covet the Asian continent. At that time, Prime Minister Tanaka had a final plan for the continent, and he sent a representative to the Northeast to seek the construction rights for important railways. I have never seen the Tanaka Memorial, so I believe that this document does not exist." Okada was the Minister of the Navy in 1927 and must have participated in the national policy of encroaching on the continent. His testimony also revealed Tanaka's intention to invade China.

When Qin testified, the defense lawyers immediately questioned him by quoting Okada's words, and their questioning was entirely based on the denial of the existence of the Tanaka Memorial. Qin then stated: The Chinese people would never forge the Memorial. Moreover, whether the Memorial exists or not is not the main point, but the fact proves that the steps of Japan's plan to conquer the world were first to invade "Manchuria and Mongolia," then North China, and then most of China. After that, there was the attack on Pearl Harbor and the occupation of the Philippines. I cannot prove its authenticity or disbelieve it. Everything predicted in it is as if Tanaka were a prophet. It matches the subsequent actions of the Japanese army in China step by step.

During this period, Mr. Luo Jialun, the current ambassador to India, wrote an article providing the facts he personally experienced. One is: He once visited Tang Erhe (later a Chinese traitor), a pro-Japanese figure who participated in the Northeast's confidential affairs during Zhang Zuolin's time. According to him, "This document was obtained from his hands with a lot of effort. This was a very difficult task. I know the details and have seen the original Japanese text. Who has such great talent and such familiarity with the inside information to be able to forge it! If there were such talented people in the Northeast who could create such a document, there would be no September 18th Incident." The second is: After a certain meeting in Beijing in the 24th year of the Republic, he talked with a certain important person who was responsible in the Northeast, saying that if the original document was not searched by the Japanese when he returned to the Northeast in the future, he could show it to him. Luo also speculated that these originals were copies and photos. The Japanese knew the seriousness of the document's leakage, so they immediately denied it and may have destroyed the original. After the war, in order to reduce the responsibility for war crimes, there was even more need to eliminate it. Unfortunately, Luo did not inquire with Tang Erhe to clarify the details, nor did he point out the name of the person and continue to pursue the matter.

Later, on October 8, the Soviet prosecutor presented at the Tokyo International Tribunal the confession of the Russian traitor Semenov, who had already been executed in the Soviet Union, confirming that Japan's plan to conquer the world, the "Tanaka Memorial," did exist. Semenov claimed that Tanaka Giichi had personally told him about this matter.

In short, this mystery has not yet been fully revealed. The Japanese deny it; Europeans and Americans focus on empirical evidence and naturally doubt the document's existence. But we firmly believe that this is a document that cannot be overthrown in fact. We still hope that the Chinese people can work hard to explore the inside story of this mystery and fully reveal it to the world in order to prove Japan's consistent policy of aggression against China since the Meiji Restoration.

### A String of Pearls

— Hu Lu

White Terror

Food is incredibly expensive, the price of each grain compared to pearls! Peasants' sweat and blood, famine victims' tears! Few rich, many poor, life is hard to sigh!

Wailing sounds fill the fields, relief is difficult, starving corpses fill the cities, hard to clear, Guanyin clay swallowed in injustice! Wild dogs fight over corpses, a world of utter misery?

### Drops of Gold

— Hu Lu

Taiwanese Watermelons on the Market

Taiwan produces beautiful watermelons, rare treasures, good business! The price exceeds riding a crane to Yangzhou, exhausting the immortal's breath!

Before summer arrives, it dominates the market, the poor's eyes, the rich's mouths - smiling, sweet juice drips gold, every drop of farmer's tears!

Note: The price of watermelon is 6,000 yuan per catty, each weighing fifteen or sixteen catties, costing nearly 100,000 yuan. Recently, prices have soared, probably more than this number. The ancients regarded "having 100,000 strings of cash and riding a crane to Yangzhou" as a source of pride. If they heard the price of watermelons, they would definitely shake their heads incessantly.

### How to Listen to a Piano Recital?

— Sheng He

A piano solo (Piano) is a common program in ordinary concerts, and individual recitals by pianists are also often seen. In modern times, piano solo recitals are called Piano Recitals, referring to playing entirely from memory without looking at the score. This name and method originated with the piano master Liszt.

When listening to a piano solo, one cannot only consider whether the music is pleasing to the ear, because this is the most superficial way of listening, which is "understanding the sound but not appreciating the music." An advanced music listener should have at least the following common knowledge for appreciating a piano solo:

(1) Pay attention to whether the sound of the playing is clear, especially during fast passages and staccato and arpeggio playing. An excellent piano player must make every note very clear, without being blurred or chaotic.

(2) Pay attention to whether the technique is flexible and beautiful. Technique is an important factor in playing the piano. It is not only related to playing skills but also contributes to the expression of the music. Because pianos are habitually placed on the left side of the stage, when going to listen to a piano solo, you should choose a seat on the left side in advance so that you can see the soloist's technique.

(3) Pay attention to the soloist's understanding of the music, in other words, attention to the expressive aspects. An excellent pianist, when playing, can control the audience's vision and hearing from beginning to end, attracting them so that they lose their autonomy. In slow passages, the playing is gentle and winding; in fast passages, it is lively and powerful; in relaxed passages, it is calm and composed; in tense passages, it is as heavy as thunder.

(4) Pay attention to the end of the music. Generally, a piece chosen for a solo is a famous piano piece with relatively difficult and complex techniques and content. The end of the piece often has special developments. Either the expressive power is richer, or there is a special ending, indicating the complete end of the music. Therefore, listeners should not relax their attention when the playing is about to end.

In addition, if you want to further appreciate the beauty of harmony and the soloist's skillful development and evolution of the music, you must understand the content of the music in advance and have considerable cultivation.

### It's Miuzhuan - Not Miuzhuan

— Jian Hua

In the Free Talk section on the 29th, Mr. Qi Chong's article "Talking about Seal Script Characters" read "缪篆" (miù zhuàn) as "謬篆" (miù zhuàn). The preface to Shuowen Jiezi says:

"Since then, the Taishu had eight styles: first, Dazhuan (Greater Seal Script); second, Xiaozhuan (Lesser Seal Script); third, Kefu (Engraved Tallies); fourth, Chongshu (Insect Script); fifth, Niaoshu (Bird Script); sixth, Muzhuān (Mu Seal); seventh, Shushu (Shu Script); and eighth, Lishu (Clerical Script)."

"Since Wang Mang usurped the throne, he ordered the Da Sikong Zhen Feng and others to proofread the documents and books, thinking that they should be produced and that he should revise the ancient script. At that time, there were six styles: first, Guwen (Ancient Script), the script in Confucius's wall; second, Qizi (Variant Characters), that is, ancient script with variations; third, Zhuanshu (Seal Script), that is, Xiaozhuan, created by Cheng Miao, a commoner ordered by Qin Shi Huang; fourth, Zuoshu (Left Script), that is, Qin Lishu (Qin Clerical Script); fifth, Miuzhuan (Mu Seal), used for tomb seals; sixth, Chongyan (Insect Words), used for writing on banners."

"Mu Seal was originally a character used for tomb seals. Why is it called '缪篆' (Miuzhuan)?" Duan Yucai's commentary on Shuowen Jiezi says:

"缪, read as the '缪' (móu) in '绸缪' (chóu móu, meticulous)."

It can be seen that it is not the "謬" (miù, error) in "謬讚" (miù zàn, false praise).

Film Talk

### "Spy's Loyal Soul"

— Wu Bian

Following "The Pink Bomb," this is another film depicting "underground workers." The story tells how Chongqing sent intelligence personnel to Guangzhou to work. Thus, a firefight with Japanese special agents unfolded, collecting intelligence, destroying radio stations, and arranging a series of thrilling events.

Here, women are unimpeded. The female intelligence agent played by Yuan Meiyun can do whatever she wants. The head of the Japanese intelligence agency, Kong Qi, and the chief of special agents, Yamamoto, are simply being played by her in the palm of her hand.

The most regrettable thing is that many of the characters in the play are hollow. What can this kind of idiot dream script give us?

Yuan Meiyun, Wang Yin, Xu Liang, and Gu Wenzong are all doing their best in "acting." There is no question of good or bad acting skills. The only one who is relatively satisfactory is Yuan Lingyun's Gao Feng Chuanzi.

From the handling of each scene, the use of montage, and the editing of the play, one can see the director's incompetence and lack of common sense. In short, this is a film that wastes film and wastes the audience's time.

New Knowledge

### Sixth Sense

— Bao Zhongqi

Have you ever had the feeling - before picking up the phone to answer a sudden call, that you can roughly guess who the caller is? Have you ever had the experience - when a person has not said a word, that you can guess the meaning of the word? If so, this is what psychologists call Extrasensory Perception (ESP) - the sixth sense. In other words, it is an instinct to feel things without going through the five senses of sight, touch, hearing, taste, and smell.

Professor Rhine and his assistants at Duke University spent seventeen years of research to prove the existence of the sixth sense. The most common method of testing is "clairvoyance", that is, guessing the content of a painting without going through sight or touch. Regarding these, the famous American Happiness magazine has selected a lot of materials. The conclusion reached is that all mentally normal people should have the possibility of a sixth sense; those with close relationships, such as twins or couples, are even more obvious. Twins often consider the same very strange event at the same time. To give another example: Someone has a sudden, inexplicable feeling before going on a trip, as if some danger is about to strike him, so he cancels the trip. As a result, the means of transportation he planned to take did crash.

Psychologists tell us that the sixth sense is extremely difficult to control; otherwise, this mysterious and inexplicable sixth sense will no longer be unfathomable. (This article is taken from the May issue of Happiness Magazine)

### Chronicle of a Besieged City

— Qin Shouou

Just then, Zhang Chang suddenly rushed over again in a frenzy.

"Old Zhu, Mrs. Hu's fever is getting higher! It's very dangerous! Very dangerous!" He rushed to Old Zhu, covered in sweat, and said in a very hurried tone, "More red spots have appeared on her arms. I'm afraid it's typhus. You have to think of a way quickly!"

"Alas! Terrible, terrible!" Lu the cripple couldn't help but sigh again.

Everything that happened today seemed to be deliberately tormenting Old Zhu. He couldn't help but start to feel anxious.

"Think of a way? Brother, you tell me! What way is there to think of in this place?" He stared at Zhang Chang's face with widened eyes, as if he was angry with him.

"Now, the first thing is to save Mrs. Hu. Either find a doctor for her quickly, or make her leave here quickly to a place where there is a doctor!" Zhang Chang said breathlessly. Although he was also concerned about Lan, it was different from Zhu Zhaonian's feelings for Lan. Therefore, his thoughts were not chaotic, and he spoke very logically.

"Car? Doctor? As long as there are any, I, old man, am willing to exchange my life for them, ......" His nerves were obviously somewhat abnormal. His speech was unknowingly as激烈的(激烈的?) as a proclamation, and his voice became high-pitched and sharp, making it unpleasant to listen to.

"I do have a doctor." Zhang Chang gradually understood his emotions, so he tried his best to calm his mind and changed to a conciliatory tone, saying, "If you go up one more stop, it's Hechi. Hechi is a county and has a county hospital. My uncle is the director there ......"

These words were like drinking a large bowl of cold water for Old Zhu, and his heart calmed down slightly.

"Very good, this is very good!" He showed a decisive expression and said, "Then, I'll go talk to them about the car right away. No matter what, let's get Lan to (哪里?) first!"

As he spoke, he immediately left Lu and Zhang Chang and squeezed into the crowd.

This took about twenty-five minutes. The result was that he only achieved half of his goal. One driver agreed to take two people to Hechi or (哪里?). This was because Zhu Zhaonian first revealed the name of the head of the Transportation Department of the Trade Committee, and this driver happened to have advanced through Zhao's connections.
