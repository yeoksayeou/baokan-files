### Passing of Peace Proposal at the Council; Submitted to Full Review Committee for Discussion; Preparing Telegram to Urge CCP Representatives to Come to Beijing

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 26th] Zhang Qun is scheduled to invite Zhang Bojun, Chu Fucheng, Zhang Nanxian, and Xu Deheng on the evening of the 27th to discuss how to proceed with the peace plan.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 26th] The biggest theme of this session of the Political Consultative Council, the appeal for peace, was proposed at 6:20 PM on the 26th during the 11th meeting of the Council. The entire atmosphere was invigorated, and the councilors vied to speak, creating the most enthusiastic scene since the opening of the conference. The one who brought up this issue was Xiao Yishan with an ad hoc emergency motion. The motion had as many as 99 co-signers. He proposed three measures: (1) Immediately hold a full review committee to discuss the peace issue; (2) Organize a special committee to formulate a concrete plan; (3) The Council should telegraph the CCP councilors to come to Beijing to attend and jointly plan national affairs. These measures were passed by the Council, and it was decided to hold a full review committee on the morning of the 28th to submit them for discussion. After Chairman Lin Hu announced the motion, Xiao immediately went forward to speak, explaining in detail. He said that since telegrams to the CCP councilors could not be sent out, they could use radio broadcasting. Regarding the proposal to telegraph the CCP and the peace issue, Secretary-General of the Council Shao Lizi immediately reported that a total of eighteen items had been received, plus the ad hoc motion proposed by Kong Geng and others received today, making a total of nineteen items. The presidium had already decided to submit all the above cases to the full review committee for review. The introduction of this issue obviously aroused the attention of the councilors. The councilors who stood up to speak included Kong Geng, Sha Yankai, Luo Mengzhou, Wang Chongping, Jiang Hengyuan, Wu Zhaoxu, etc., all of whom believed that it was necessary to submit it for discussion quickly. After the chairman asked if there were any objections, the motion was successfully passed. As for the telegram to the CCP, the chairman also announced that the secretariat would draft it and submit it for approval at the 12th meeting on the morning of the 27th.

The full text of the ad hoc emergency motion proposed by Xiao Yishan and others is as follows:

Peace is the unanimous demand of the people of the country and also the policy repeatedly announced by the government. This Council, as the highest organ of public opinion, cannot ignore this major issue that concerns the fate of the country. Since the assembly, colleagues have discussed and various parties have appealed, and the atmosphere has permeated the whole country. Peace and war are still on a knife edge. Although judging from past facts, the future is not optimistic, we know that it cannot be done, but doing it should be the final direction of this Council's efforts. Now that the session is limited, empty talk is of no help. We propose to hold a full review meeting quickly, discuss it in detail, and then ask the presidium to nominate several people to organize a special committee to formulate a concrete plan to facilitate progress, and immediately telegraph the CCP councilors to come to Beijing to attend and jointly plan national affairs, put down arms, in order to save the nation from crisis.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 26th] More than forty councilors, including Kong Geng, proposed an ad hoc motion at the 11th meeting of the Political Consultative Council on the afternoon of the 26th, which was decided to be submitted to the full review committee for review. The full text is as follows: "It is proposed to use the name of the Council to send a telegram to the Chinese Communist Party, asking it to quickly send representatives and propose a plan to restore peace, come to Beijing immediately, and conduct negotiations with the groups organized by this Council; then if they willingly endanger the Republic of China, the Council should send a telegram to the whole country, appealing to the government to issue a clear order to suppress them, in order to maintain the lives of the people and consolidate national unity. (Reason) After eight years of war against Japan, the country's vitality has been greatly damaged. After the victory, we should jointly plan the construction of the country. Unexpectedly, the Communist Party has started wars and caused chaos, and smoke of gunpowder is everywhere. The people suffer unspeakably. Although the government has negotiated with them several times, no agreement has been reached. As a result, the suffering of the people has deepened, and the financial crisis has become more serious. The people of the whole country are looking forward to peace as they are looking forward to a good harvest. If the CCP is willing to have peace, railway traffic will be restored, and the government will reiterate its determination to resolve the CCP issue through political means. I believe that the highest organ of public opinion in the country should represent the people of the whole country and send a telegram to the CCP, asking it to immediately send responsible representatives and propose a plan to restore peace, come to Beijing immediately, and conduct negotiations with this Council to restore peace throughout the country, save the people from fire and water, and consolidate the unity of the country. (Measures) (1) The Council shall resolve to use the name of the Council to send a telegram to the CCP, asking it to quickly send representatives and propose a plan to restore peace, come to Beijing immediately, and conduct negotiations with this Council. (2) The Council shall nominate representatives to organize a national body to negotiate with the Communist Party. After an agreement is reached, they will then negotiate with the government to make a decision. (3) If the Communist Party still has no intention of repenting and refuses to send representatives and propose a plan to restore peace, it is willingly destroying the Republic of China and harming the country and the people. The responsibility shall be borne by the Communist Party, and the Council shall send a telegram to the whole country, appealing to the government to issue a clear order to suppress them."

### Regarding the Content of the Peace Talks Proposals, Shao Congen and Others Suggest Organizing a Peace Promotion Association

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 26th] At the 11th meeting of the Political Consultative Council on the 26th, a total of eighteen proposals related to the CCP issue and peace negotiations were passed to the full review committee for review.

(2) Yang Yuzi and 6 others proposed to appeal to the government to resume peace talks.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 26th] The Fourth Session of the Third Political Consultative Council has been open for seven days, and the reporting stage of the conference is about to be completed. As of the afternoon of the 26th, only the land administration, health, economy, Resources Commission, and post-war relief have not yet been submitted. At the 11th meeting on the afternoon of the 26th, Song Yishan and others proposed an ad hoc motion, saying that the land administration and health ministries had not been established for a long time, and the work of the land administration and health ministries had been included in the written work report of the Executive Yuan. To save time at the conference, it was changed to be held in the review committee, which was passed by the conference. The conference on the 27th will be a report on the economy, the Resources Commission, and post-war relief. It is expected that it can be completed on that day, and the review of proposals will begin on the 28th.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 26th] The Political Consultative Council held its 11th meeting at 3:30 PM on the 26th. 197 councilors attended, and Lin Hu chaired. Minister of Interior Zhang Lisheng made a report on internal affairs and answered questions.

### Minister of Education Continues to Answer Oral Questions

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 26th] The 10th meeting of the Political Consultative Council was held at 9:20 AM on the 26th. 204 councilors attended, and Li Huang chaired. Twelve people continued to raise oral questions on the education report until 10:30 AM. Then, Minister Zhu answered, lasting for an hour, and the chairman announced a break. The meeting continued at 11:15 AM, and Minister of Water Conservancy Xue Dubi reported on water conservancy work, which ended at 12:25 PM. Then, 20 written questions were read, and four people, including Xue Mingjian, spoke orally. Because the time was too late, the remaining oral questions were changed to written questions. At the same time, Xue's answer was also changed to a written answer, and the meeting adjourned at 1:00 PM in the afternoon.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 26th] The questions raised by Zhang Qiyun and 12 others on the education report at the 10th meeting of the Political Consultative Council still focused on the student movement. Zhang Qiyun believes that peace, prices, and the student movement are all related, and hopes to jointly review these three issues, seek a conclusion, and then pass it through the State Council and have the government implement it. Huang Yuren believes that part of the cause of the student movement is due to the instigation of bad elements, but most students are dissatisfied with the status quo and the corruption of the government. Wang Huamin pointed out that most of the publicly funded students established by the Ministry of Education are in schools in Beijing and Shanghai, and many of these students are from wealthy families. On the contrary, there is no public funding for homeless and exiled youth in the Northeast, which is unfair. Han Chunxuan said that Northeast youth who have received 14 years of enslaved education cannot settle down and study after returning to the embrace of the motherland. He asked the Ministry of Education to thoroughly investigate the funding for the restoration of education in the Northeast. Yu Ruzhou appealed for the difficulty of Northeast students learning English, and at the same time pointed out that the funding for border education is too small, and border education should be universal. Li Peiguo said that there are more than 7,000 elementary schools and more than 20 middle schools in Rehe, and there is not a single national one. After the questions were completed, Minister Zhu began to answer at 10:35 AM. Zhu first expressed his regret over the student movement, and then explained the various issues separately: (1) The system of general examinations and final examinations. The general examination has been held since 1933 and has never been interrupted, except for one suspension in 1945 and another suspension in 1946 due to the relocation of the school. It will be resumed this year, but it has been decided to suspend it for another year this year. The final examination was previously handled by each school at its discretion. Last year, some schools did not handle it, and it is still handled at the discretion of each school this year, emphasizing "discretion". (2) The issue of separate schools for men and women. This system was decided at the first National Education Conference in 1928, and this year only reaffirmed the previous order, and was not specifically proposed. Some councilors have proposed that female teachers should be the principal of elementary schools in principle, and this Ministry plans to establish more women's normal schools. (3) The issue of relocating Yingshi University. The Ministry of Education seriously considered that it was decided at the 1935 Education Restoration Conference and agreed by the school to establish JinHua. (4) As for Jiaotong University, the name change is actually a misunderstanding, because the Nanyang University in northern and southern China had a glorious record in the history of Chinese education, and the Nanyang University was the predecessor of Jiaotong University. I mentioned this matter occasionally in my speech, but the name of Jiaotong University has been used for more than ten years, so it is still used as the name of Jiaotong University without changing it. Regarding the nautical and marine engineering departments, nautical science was established during the Guangxu years. At the end of the Guangxu years, the Shanghai Wusong Merchant Marine School was established, so the original nautical science students were transferred to the Merchant Marine School. After graduating from the merchant school, Jiaotong University no longer had a nautical department. At the beginning of the Anti-Japanese War, the merchant marine school was destroyed, and the Ministry of Education reopened it in Chongqing. However, the school had several disturbances and was suspended. Its remaining students were entrusted by the Ministry of Education to Jiaotong University for management. As a result, Jiaotong University requested to restore the nautical department, and the Ministry of Education approved the new students to be transferred to the Merchant Marine School because the two departments had been allocated to the Merchant Marine School. However, Jiaotong University is now requesting to restore the nautical department and has caused a student movement. It is unreasonable to establish a marine engineering department in the College of Engineering, but it was approved because the school requested it. (5) Zhongzheng University was established during the war, and its equipment was difficult and the treatment of professors was low, which caused a disturbance. The Ministry of Education sent personnel to go to the school to solve the disturbance together with the principal. (6) The renaming of Hunan University to Yuelu University was approved by the educational community in Hunan Province, and the chairman of Hunan Province, Wang Dongyuan, also hoped that it could be renamed as soon as possible. The Ministry of Education had the intention of renaming it, but it has not been decided. It is still Hunan University. (7) Regarding the Hubei Normal College, the principal was unwilling to return to the college to handle matters because the address was not determined and the funding for restoration was too small, which caused a problem. (8) As for the restoration of Beiping Normal University, according to the school, the Normal University is a school with a history. After the war, it was moved to Xi'an and merged into the Northwest Associated University. After the restoration, because there were only two colleges of liberal arts, it was restored to Beiping Normal College and could not be called a university. In the future, it will be established as a complete university. (9) The Tianjin Institute of Technology and Commerce wants to establish a liberal arts department, and the Ministry of Education feels that "industry and commerce" cannot establish a liberal arts department. The college also requested to be changed to a university, and the Ministry of Education believes that the procedures for changing to a university should be handled. (10) The funding for education is too small, and we are trying to find ways to solve it. The issue of publicly funded students is too broad. (11) The atmosphere of the student movement. Most of the students are indeed pure elements. The government's order this time is a measure to deal with public security issues in general. Zhu's answer lasted for an hour, and he finished at 11:35 AM.

### Chairman Chiang Scheduled to Invite Political Councilors to Dinner

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 26th] Chairman Chiang is scheduled to invite Kuomintang political councilors to dinner on the evening of the 27th and all political councilors on the evening of the 28th.

### Internal Affairs Report and Questions; Political Councilors Request to Clarify Official Corruption

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 26th] Minister of Interior Zhang Lisheng made a report on internal affairs at the 11th meeting of the Political Consultative Council on the afternoon of the 26th and answered questions. Zhang's report gave a detailed explanation of the various businesses under the jurisdiction of the Ministry, such as local administration, local autonomy, elections, police administration, and prohibition of smoking. When he talked about the revision of the Publication Law, he said that as of noon today, the Ministry has not received any reports on the suspension of publication of the Shanghai Wenhui, United, and Xinmin newspapers, and he will definitely investigate it in the future. Recently, news published in some newspapers does not conform to the facts, which has disrupted social order. The government should take measures to maintain social order, but there are many difficulties in handling it. We hope that the newspapers can put their remarks on the right track, so the Publication Law has been revised and can be sent to the Legislative Yuan. The excessively strict restrictions in the past have been relaxed.

After the secretariat read 21 questions, oral questions began, and the speakers focused on rectifying official corruption. Ma Chengfeng said that a major defect in China's current politics is the centralization of power, with all power concentrated in the central government, forming a situation in which local governments have no ability, and the provincial government is only a transfer mechanism. Regarding the preparatory work for the general election, Ma believes that before the country has not been peacefully unified, universal suffrage is difficult to proceed if the actual military situation is not taken into account. Shen Zhijing pointed out that the work of the public security police is not easy to do well, and at the same time pointed out the corruption of officialdom in Qiongya, with the "Ten Killings" rules, which made people have no way to survive. Fan Chengshu put forward four points: there are too many agencies, too much employment, too vague laws and regulations, and too heavy burdens on the people. He asked the Ministry of Interior to pay attention. Pan Chaoying also pointed out that there are too many donations and taxes in Hainan Island, and the people are unable to make a living, and bandits are forcing land. He asked the Ministry of Interior to pay attention. Jiang Hengyuan pointed out that attention should be paid to protecting human rights to comfort the people. Chen Yiyun pointed out the shortcomings of grassroots politics, and the captain of the security team in Moxian County, eastern Guangdong, is a proven traitor and no one dares to interfere with his wrongdoing. He asked Minister Zhang to deal with it severely. Chen Gengya believes that the qualifications of candidates should be strictly investigated in the election issue, and newspapers that publish false news should be dealt with according to law and notified with a warning. Lu Qian first talked about the change of social atmosphere, believing that there is a need to investigate the responsibility of superiors. Secondly, he asked for an explanation of the social elite. Finally, he believes that the term of office of the provincial and county governors and the funding for local autonomy should be agreed upon. Zhu Yiqing said that the election issue was almost handled by the police in the past, and he hopes that improvements can be made in the future. Luo Heng pointed out that the number of women should be specified in the elections of people's institutions at all levels, and women's occupations should be guaranteed. Regarding the issue of official corruption, if the corrupt are not prosecuted, official corruption cannot be rectified.

Zhang answered the oral questions on the spot. Regarding the issue of rectifying official corruption, he said that he would definitely deal with the local problems that were reported. After Zhang finished speaking, Jin Zhenyu raised questions about the number of seats for the Shanghai Municipal Council, and Zhang replied that he had no decision-making power.

### Water Conservancy Questions

Emphasizing the Yellow River Blocking Project

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 26th] After the water conservancy report at the Political Consultative Council on the morning of the 26th, the Secretariat read more than 20 written questions submitted by Yao Tingfang, Wu Zhimei, and other political councilors. Then, Xue Mingjian, Ma Jingchang, and other political councilors made oral questions. The most frequently asked question was about blocking and restoring the dikes. They all believed that although the Yellow River blocking project has been completed, the Yellow River has returned to its old course. The project of restoring the dikes in the lower reaches of the Yellow River should be accelerated, and dredging work must be carried out at the same time. If it is delayed, the large flood will come and create a new flooded area. It is especially necessary to cooperate with the Chinese team to protect the project, rush to prevent the Communist army from sabotage. Regarding the personnel and experts who have contributed to the blocking this time, they believe that the government should use them as much as possible, and should not discard them after use. Secondly, the more important issue in the inquiry is that agricultural water conservancy throughout the country should be accelerated. As for Taiwan, it was originally a grain-producing area. During the Japanese control period, it paid attention to water conservancy. In the future, there are new water conservancy plans for further improvement. The increased food production in the province will be even more considerable, and the mainland can also receive the effect of regulation. Zhao Gonglu also proposed the suggestion of maintaining soil and water and cultivating water sources. Ma Jingchang hoped to adjust the water conservancy institutions and that special personnel should be responsible. For example, the Yangtze River Water Conservancy Commission, the Huai River Guidance Commission, etc. should be changed to engineering bureaus, which are solely responsible for construction. The administrative design of the two departments is under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Water Conservancy. After the political councilors finished asking questions, because it was too late, the chairman asked Minister Xue to give written answers.

### Political Councilors' Ad Hoc Motion Requests to Ensure Freedom of the Press

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 26th] Female political councilor Jin Zhenyu submitted an ad hoc motion to the Political Consultative Council on the 26th, "Please the government to earnestly protect freedom of the press and practitioners," which was submitted for discussion at the 11th meeting in the afternoon. Jin also explained it on the speaker's platform, and it was passed and submitted for review.

### Xu Xiaoyan's Proposal to Relax Newspaper Quotas

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 26th] Xu Xiaoyan recently submitted a case to the Political Consultative Council regarding newsprint.

### Chairman Sends Wu Dingchang to Inquire About Shao Congen's Illness

### Zuo Shunsheng Returns to Beijing

Negotiating the Collection of Silk Cocoons and Purchase of American Fertilizer; Ministry of Agriculture Proceeds with Discussions

[Our Newspaper's Report] Minister of Agriculture Zuo Shunsheng completed his official business in Shanghai and took the express train to Beijing last night. Before his departure, Zuo stated that he enjoyed his inspection in Shanghai very much and that all units of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry in Shanghai were working very diligently. However, due to the limited time, he did not have time to inspect some undertakings. If time permits, he will come to Shanghai again next Friday or Saturday. In addition to the general inspection, there are two major issues that need to be resolved immediately: one is the purchase of silk cocoons, and the other is the purchase of American fertilizer. Regarding the former, he has discussed with Ge Jingzhong, Li Shuming, and others, and because of the recent rise in rice prices, the original loan of 20 million yuan is considered insufficient and is planned to be increased to 30 million yuan, and it is planned to be purchased quickly to avoid losses to farmers; as for the purchase of American fertilizer, the total purchase requires more than 40 million US dollars. As far as our country is concerned, this amount is not needed. He has already sent a telegram to Chairman Wei of Taiwan Province to determine the purchase quantity based on Taiwan's needs. In addition, Minister Zuo also met with Mr. Clifflai, the new director of the UNRRA China Office, yesterday and exchanged views extensively. Mr. Clifflai expressed deep concern about the full utilization of UNRRA's agricultural materials shipped to China.

[Our Newspaper's Report] According to Zuo Shunsheng, the reorganization of local governments is also under negotiation, but because the country is facing difficulties and there are too many issues to be dealt with, no conclusion has been reached yet. He said that since taking office as Minister of Agriculture and Forestry, only more than 20 members of the Youth Party have been employed, all in the secretarial and general affairs departments. These personnel are customarily those who advance and retreat with the minister; as for the technical personnel in the ministry, unless their performance is poor, he is unwilling to make any changes. Regarding the resumption of peace talks, Zuo pondered for a moment and replied: "In principle, everyone hopes for the resumption of peace talks, but there is no effective way."

The new Minister of Agriculture and Forestry, Zuo Shunsheng, previously inspected the China Insecticide Manufacturing Plant, jointly operated by UNRRA and the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, and took a group photo with the plant director, Dr. Feng (left), and UNRRA's plant pest consultant, Dr. Dill (right), in the plant's laboratory.

### Random Notes from the People's Political Council

— Our Newspaper Reporter Zhang Ming

The education report questioning on the morning of the 26th was unexpectedly calm. Some people think that off-site activities were successful; however, there were not many questions, but the answers were very long. Minister Zhu took a full hour to give a detailed answer, with reason and confidence, and seemed even more energetic than during yesterday's report.

Minister Zhang did not step onto the podium. First, he gave a 90-degree bow to the enthusiastic applause below, and greeted reporters in advance not to write about his frivolous remarks.

Minister Xue's report included quite a few "my brothers."

Fan Chengshu spoke symmetrically, "If the central government sets up a big engine, and the local government sets up a small agency, the central government has a big bureaucrat, and the local government has a small bureaucrat," which caused the audience to laugh. He also said that the people's burden was too heavy, truly "the Republic of China has ten thousand taxes."

Pan Chaoying said a few painful jokes, "Hainan Island taxes are levied on the living, and tomb donations are also levied after death." He also said that when asked, the people say everything is good, except for the lives of the common people.

Chen Yiyun boldly appealed to run the security brigade leader in the Northeast. Some people worried that she would not be able to "return" in the future. She said, "I am not afraid."

Foreign reporters specially looked for shots in the meeting place, sometimes squatting on the ground and sometimes jumping on the armrests of chairs, which annoyed their colleagues. After the meeting adjourned in the afternoon, the councilors went to the Central Hotel for a dinner party. More than a dozen news reporters "squatted" on the rostrum, scrambling to copy various motions and proposals. The "observers" were just like councilors.

Lu Qian's oral questioning was witty. He said that previously, the term "non-party leader" was used. Where did this non-party leader come from? Now, the term "social elites" is used. The combination of the two characters "elites" is still an original creation. May I ask Minister Zhang, where do social elites come from? How many elites are there in the country? The whole audience laughed.

Zhang Lisheng's oral answers to the questions were exceptionally sincere. Many questions were "answered responsibly," so the councilors were very satisfied. When he finished answering a question, applause rang out throughout the audience. Zhang was the only head of the Executive Yuan's ministries and commissions to receive the most applause in the People's Political Council report.

### The Battle Situation of the Outer Regiment in Changchun Improves; The Communist Army in Siping Street Collapses; The National Army Defending Jilin City Begins to Attack

[Our Newspaper's Changchun Dispatch, 26th] The Communist army that invaded Siping Street was completely defeated by the National Army on the afternoon of the 5th. The invading Communist army was composed of the First and Third Divisions. About 18,000 people were killed or wounded in this battle. The remnants fled to Shuangmiaozhi, attempting to sabotage the railway. The transportation authorities have ordered the urgent repair of transportation and communication equipment between Siping and Changchun. It is reported that the huge Dongliao River Railway Bridge was unfortunately destroyed by the Communist army after the defending army withdrew. In addition, more than 20,000 Communist troops north of Huaide retreated northeast through Fulong. The battle situation around Changchun has improved. The National Army launched a four-pronged attack this morning, advancing in a fan shape towards Chen'an, Shaoguodian, Fanjiatun in Huaide, and other areas west of Changchun, cutting off the Communist army's rear that had penetrated south into Siping, and intercepting its main force that was collapsing towards the north bank of the Songhua River.

[Our Newspaper's Shenyang Dispatch, 26th] The National Army searched around Changchun and found no trace of the Communist army within 20 kilometers. The Difangshen Airport in the western suburbs of Changchun City was retaken by the National Army today.

[Our Newspaper's Changchun Dispatch, 26th] According to intelligence obtained from both land and air, the Communist army on all lines north of Siping is retreating to the northwest, with part of it retreating from Qian Gorlos Banner to the north of the Jiangbei area. Judging from this, the battle situation in southern Songhua is likely to take a sharp turn, and the Communist army seems to be in a general rout. The retreat routes of the Communist army are as follows: (1) Most of the Communist army on the south bank of the Dongliao River rushed across the north bank at Shijiazi, eight miles south of the city; (2) More than 10,000 people, including the Communist army's Independent First Division and other units near Gongzhuling, gathered north of Daling. The Communist army retreated from Huaide Fulongquan to Fuyu from yesterday afternoon. The road from Fulongquan to Wangfu was endlessly connected. The air force intercepted along the way and attacked the Communist army that was crossing the Dongliao River and Songhua River. However, the Communist army uses a lot of treacherous tactics. Whether it is really retreating or has other intentions, the authorities are closely guarding against it.

[Our Newspaper's Beiping Dispatch, 26th] In order to relieve the siege of Changchun, the military authorities have decided to airlift a large army to the Northeast. In recent days, a large number of airborne military officers and paratroopers have landed in the city one after another.

This morning, the Communist army in Jiangbei fired hundreds of shells at the defending army at the bridgehead. The defending army inside the fortress was unmoved and suffered no losses.

[Another Dispatch] Liu Kui, deputy section chief of the Management Section of the 3rd Security Brigade of the Heilongjiang Military Region of the Communist Army, and Zhang Jinglin, director of the Health Office of the 8th Division of the 3rd Column, also surrendered to the National Army a few days ago and were transferred to Changchun on the 26th.

[Reported from Changchun on the 26th] The Jilin National Army launched an attack south along the Jilin-Shenyang Line and recaptured Yantongshan Station yesterday afternoon.

### 600,000 People in Changchun Become an Unbreakable Combat Body

[Central News Agency's Changchun Dispatch, 26th] The reporter went to the suburbs of the city today to inspect the city defense works and the situation of the citizens building outer trenches. The impression gained was that Changchun, with a population of 600,000, has now become an unbreakable combat body. Under any circumstances, it can support the Communist army's attack in any way for a long time. All parts of the city, from the edge to the core, are defended layer by layer, from individual strongholds to countless circular defense lines, and from these countless circular defense lines to a vast combat surface. All large and small buildings, as well as the hills, trenches, and roads on the ground, are adapted to the terrain for the best use, and the fire net formed by the warehouses, strongholds, and fortifications has made it impossible to take advantage of any angle. During the whole day of inspection, the reporter repeatedly visited the drills of various arms entering the position, and talked with the fully armed officers and soldiers from time to time. They were all very enthusiastic about their current operations and had a high degree of understanding of their tasks. When the reporter was inspecting the trench digging work, it happened to be when thousands of laborers were resting on the ground, each eating their own lunch. Among them were farmers, shop assistants, university professors, primary and secondary school teachers, civil servants, and students. During lunch, they sat in groups with acquaintances, exchanged food with each other. Soldiers on duty on the trenches were also invited to join the communal meal. The harmonious scene between the military and the people was very touching.

[Central News Agency, Qingdao, 26th] A large quantity of enemy and puppet supplies hidden in the Qingdao refugee camp has been discovered.

Editorial

### The Urgent Cry of Shanghai Citizens

The first session of the third Shanghai Municipal Council opened yesterday. This newspaper contributed the call for "Stability First" because we believe that in the current turbulent situation, stability must come first before we can speak of peace, restoration, and reconstruction. This is true for the domestic situation, as well as the local situation. Shanghai is the premier city in China, and the situation in Shanghai, from a broader perspective, is inseparable from the overall domestic situation. However, the development of the situation in Shanghai also often influences other areas. The Shanghai Municipal Council is the representative body of Shanghai citizens. In its efforts towards stability, it must proceed on both these fronts: matters of a local nature are the Council's undeniable responsibility, and matters of a national nature are also within its purview.

On the first day of the Council's third session, we saw that in the preparatory meeting, two emergency motions were eagerly proposed and passed by the general assembly. The first was proposed by Xu Jiqing and 42 others, "Requesting this Council to advise the CCP to resume peace talks, students to resume classes immediately, support the government in maintaining order, and promote permanent peace in order to achieve national unity and social stability." The second was proposed by Zhang Zhongyuan and 102 others: "Telegraphing the Political Consultative Council and the councils of all provinces and municipalities across the country, urging the responsible persons of the Communist Party to immediately send representatives to resume peace talks, turn swords into plowshares, and rescue the people from fire and water." Although these two proposals are still subject to ratification at today's first general assembly, they have already undergone heated discussion yesterday and passed unanimously. The key points of the measures are: (1) Telegraphing legal entities across the country, unanimously requesting the National Government and the National Political Consultative Council to advocate that the National Government promptly set a date and order the Chinese Communist Party to immediately lay down their arms, cease the rebellion, and submit to unified command. If they can fulfill this as scheduled, they can be regarded as a political party and still be treated with tolerance. The National Army will also cease fire on the spot and not pursue them. If they remain unrepentant and continue to use force, the government should immediately concentrate its efforts and issue a clear order to suppress the rebellion, and the Council should unite with public opinion organs in various provinces and cities to send a final warning to the CCP; (2) Issuing a declaration advocating that all parties implement the agreement to withdraw from schools uniformly, and requesting the parents of striking students to promptly advise their children to resume classes on a fixed date; (3) Supporting the National Government's promulgation of the temporary measures for maintaining social order and the four implementation measures formulated by the Shanghai authorities. Although we have not yet read the above declarations as of the time of writing, the passage of these emergency motions shows how the Municipal Council is working to achieve stability. The people of the entire city will undoubtedly be greatly encouraged and place high hopes on it.

What we are most moved and gratified by after reading these two proposals passed by the Municipal Council is that their submission truly represents the general will of the citizens of Shanghai. In post-war China, which is scarred by war, what we need is unity, stability, and peace. The people of China can no longer tolerate the current situation dragging on, and we immediately need stability. Only with stability can we hope to recuperate and rebuild. The current situation is extremely unreasonable, with both sides using force. While using force, one side still claims that the hope for peace is not extinguished, while the other is intensifying its military offensive and political disturbances. In this situation, peace is not a reality, stability is impossible, and the government seems to be acting without justification, which increases social unrest and makes the people feel more pain. In all efforts for stability, we must first strive for the stability of the overall situation, and then we can achieve local stability. Therefore, we welcome the passage of these two proposals by the Shanghai Municipal Council.

As for the CCP, we have repeatedly argued that they should prioritize the people, immediately lay down their arms, and work together with other peaceful and legal political parties to achieve the democratization and modernization of China as soon as possible. We believe that every political party should have an ideology, and while ideologies may differ, the goal of promoting the welfare of the people and the interests of the nation should be the same. Under this common premise, all political parties can cooperate. We know that the Chinese Communist Party is a party with an ideology, but we firmly believe that they should ultimately have the goal of promoting the welfare of the people and the interests of the nation. Under this premise, we hope that they will ultimately heed the urgent calls of the general public and resolutely lay down their arms, so that the Chinese people who have long suffered can have some respite. Now that the Shanghai Municipal Council has passed the above emergency motions, we hope that public opinion organs across the country will rise up in response and shout out the unanimous call of the people of the whole country: Save us, the people who are suffering! We demand stability!

### Students Should Indeed Rein in Their Horses at the Edge of the Cliff!

The Shanghai student movement has almost reached a turning point today. Will it subside? Will it expand? Will it become uncontrollable? It depends on how the young students exercise their actions. Yesterday, Mayor Wu received reporters and said that the arrested students in the city, except for those suspected of inciting strikes and market shutdowns, had been agreed with Commander Xuan to be taken back by their respective schools and parents. Student representatives from various schools also agreed to resume classes in full today. The student movement, which had been surging, should now hopefully subside. Since "Stability First" is the unanimous call of Shanghai citizens, we hope that the student movement will end as soon as possible. Now that Mayor Wu has announced the results of his talks with Jiaotong University students, and all schools can resume classes today, this turmoil can be said to be over. First of all, we must commend Mayor Wu's wise actions and the authorities' sincere care for the youth. Students have received considerable education, and university students have particularly high levels of knowledge. As long as their overflowing emotions can eventually be overcome by reason, then with Mayor Wu's sincere attitude and reasonable handling, every pure student should be moved to resume classes.

Students are the vanguard of intellectuals. In their youthful years, they pursue ideals and are dissatisfied with reality, hence the so-called student movement. This is understandable. If the purpose of the movement is pure and the actions do not exceed the norm, it will naturally win the general sympathy of society and achieve the expected goals. Even if emotions sometimes cannot be controlled and actions may inevitably deviate from the norm, if reason can be restored in time and actions brought back on track, they may not necessarily be unforgiven by the world. If this student movement can gradually subside, it will be due to the action overcoming emotion. However, according to news received at the time of writing, some students convened a meeting again last night after the arrested students were released, which lasted late into the night, and it seems that they intend to persist in the strike. While this news still needs to be confirmed by the events of this morning, we hope that most students will still recognize the facts and no longer be exploited by a few who harbor ulterior motives, so that this student movement can subside here. At a time when the nation is facing unprecedented difficulties, what the people of the whole country unanimously demand is stability. Students are intellectuals and should deeply understand the difficulties of the times and start by stabilizing themselves and diligently pursuing their studies. If it unfortunately fails to subside, it is clear that their movement will go astray and may even no longer be regarded as a student movement, but as a destruction of social order and an obstruction of public safety, which would not be stepping into the legal net? We believe that students should indeed rein in their horses at the edge of the cliff!

### Correspondences from Various Places

Zhenjiang

He Yu, Director of the Jiangsu Provincial Food and Grain Office, recently told reporters: "Currently, there is a lack of grain before the harvest, and rice shortages occur from time to time. This phenomenon is not due to a lack of food, but to artificial mismanagement. Although rice prices fluctuate, the counties of this province still have several hundred thousand shi of stored grain, so there is nothing to fear. We can hold price stabilization sales when necessary."

Kunshan

Rice prices here have been rising again for days. At around 8:00 AM on the 25th, over a hundred residents from northern Jiangsu, carrying rice scoops and cloth bags, swarmed to Caishi Road, the north bank of the city moat, and the east gate area to rob rice from grain stores. The situation became chaotic, and over ten rice stores suffered significant losses. Afterwards, the police station arrested over twenty rice robbers for interrogation.

Changshu

The rice reserves here are constantly being exported, causing market prices to skyrocket and fall into chaos, approaching 400,000 yuan. Qu Zhenwu, chairman of the Grain Industry Association, suddenly submitted his resignation. The county government stopped issuing export permits from the 25th, monitoring market transactions to maintain the people's food supply.

Wujin

The black market price of grain in this county reached as high as 340,000 yuan per shi on the 24th. For the sake of the common people's food supply, the county government decided to implement price stabilization sales. The standard for price stabilization rice is ordinary and medium-grade hot rice. 170,000 units are to be sold starting from the 30th, in five locations.

Minhang

The Shanghai County Government recently received approval from the Jiangsu Provincial Government to issue 300 million yuan in local financial bonds. The denominations are divided into five types: 100,000, 150,000, 200,000, 400,000, and 800,000. They are to be subscribed by industries, businesses, and grain households throughout the county, and must be completed by the end of this month. These bonds can be used to offset this year's field taxes and levies.

Jinhua

In order to improve the conscription administration, the Zhejiang West Garrison Headquarters, commanded by Ou, specifically scheduled a military service conference for June 1st, to be attended by the commanders of all regiment management districts under its jurisdiction, chief staff officers, county magistrates, and military section chiefs.

Dongtai

This county has been suffering from a prolonged drought, and epidemics are rampant. Fortunately, heavy rain fell on the night of the 19th and lasted for two days and nights until the weather cleared on the 21st. Merchants and farmers throughout the county were overjoyed.

Haoxian

Zhang Shaowu, the chief of Jianqing Town in Hao County, was reported by all the representatives of the town council for falsely accusing Zhang Disheng, the chairman of the town council, of corruption and dereliction of duty. The county government accepted the case and investigated it, and after confirming the facts, he was dismissed and punished.

### British Labour Party Congress Opens - Chairman Noel-Baker Delivers Speech - Vigorously Advocates Promoting International Cooperative Relations

[United Press, Margate, England, 26th] British Air Minister, also Chairman of the Labour Party Executive Committee, Noel-Baker, delivered the opening speech at the Labour Party annual congress today, calling on the British government to take the lead in establishing a new relationship of equality and trust among the peoples of the world. It is said that "Britain's internal difficulties are insignificant compared to the major problems the world faces. The major task now is to build peace on a solid foundation. The British government should try to develop a new system of economic cooperation between all continents of the world, whose development and expectations are greater than we have ever known. First, we must eliminate old mistakes and establish new relationships, that is, the relationship of equality and trust between the peoples of Western Europe, America, and the rest of the world. We must make the United Nations organization a factor in international affairs. If given time, this world peace organization will be able to complete its task. Anyone who thinks that the United Nations organization has been tested and failed only shows his ignorance and stupidity. But we must still convince our ally the Soviet Union that Britain's true interests do not conflict with theirs, and we must convince them that although the social systems of different countries are different, they can still live under the Charter of the United Nations and seek friendship and peace together. If we can end the fear of war, there is hardly any undertaking that we cannot accomplish. We can increase the irrigated area in the Middle East five or tenfold, lead the sea into the Sahara Desert, change the climate of half a continent, and bring water to the Kalahari Desert in South Africa, making it a new land for whites and blacks to live in. China has more than ten rivers that need to be dammed. Believe me, the above projects are child's play compared to radar and atomic bombs. We must also remember that Britain's trade, food, raw materials, and even the living standards of every family depend on all continents, not just one." Noel-Baker then vigorously defended the Labour government's domestic and foreign work, calling on the country to support the government's foreign policy, and reiterated what Foreign Secretary Bevin recently said in the House of Commons, that Britain still sees itself as a great power. It is said that "Foreigners must not believe that Britain has declined and weakened. Britain's strength lies in its people, in its connection with the dominions, and in its friendship with countries that have jointly defended justice in the past. The British people are healthier, more educated, and more creative than before. The Commonwealth is becoming more united, and Britain's friendship with other countries on all continents is real and strong."

### Morrison Issues Warning to "Rebellious" Party Members

[Reuters, Margate, 25th] Lord Privy Seal Morrison issued a warning to Labour Party "rebellious" party members on the eve of the Labour Party Congress held here, saying that sometimes individualism is used excessively, forming a chaotic situation, which is harmful to the country. Although the Labour Party recognizes the appropriate freedom required by the parliamentary system, it also hopes that all party members will not put the ship at risk of running aground. If the Labour Party can maintain its excellent form and act with good intentions, it will be able to maintain its power.

### Bevin to Defend Policy on Thursday

[Agence France-Presse, Margate, 25th] The Labour Party meeting today was held simultaneously in two sessions. Speakers at the Lido Theatre included Irving, Professor Laski, and Lord Privy Seal Morrison; speakers at the Winter Garden included Chancellor of the Exchequer Dalton, etc. There were originally as many as 600 motions on the agenda of the Congress, but most of them have been withdrawn or merged.

[United Press, Margate, 26th] Two motions originally on the agenda of the Labour Party Congress, (1) expressing regret over the government's Palestine policy, which affects "Britain's good reputation overseas," and (1) urging the government to immediately transfer the responsibility for managing the Holy Land to the United Nations organization, have now been deleted together, leaving only one resolution on Palestine at the Congress. Foreign Secretary Bevin is scheduled to deliver a paper on Palestine at the Congress on Thursday. The number of resolutions on diplomacy on the agenda has been reduced to fifteen, and the content expresses regret over the following two matters: (1) Britain's policy towards Greece has resulted in a reactionary government coming to power; (2) Britain fully supports the United States' actions towards Turkey and Greece in the Security Council. Another resolution recognizes that "it is necessary to maintain a very close relationship with the United States, but it is equally important to obtain very close cooperation with the Soviet Union." Other resolutions endorse Bevin's foreign policy and call on the European socialist movement to unite and accelerate European economic and political recovery.

### Compensation Representatives from Various Countries Inspect Japanese Armament Factories

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 26th] The inspection schedule for compensation representatives from various countries this week and next week includes one each of the Japanese Navy Armament Factory, the Army Armament Factory, the Aircraft Manufacturing Factory, and a merchant-run munitions factory. According to the plan, there are a total of 659 aircraft and munitions manufacturing plants to be used for compensation. Including the machinery in official and merchant-run factories, there are over 30,000 pieces. They have inspected only thirteen so far. According to our country's representative, they are most concerned about tools, because they are easier to install and faster to use. The machinery and tools that our country will receive as compensation in the future will be enough to establish twenty machine tool factories.

### Last Month's Japanese Yarn Production Breaks Post-War Record

Reaching 34.8 Million Pounds

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 26th] Japanese cotton yarn production has increased significantly every month since last November. It was 23.6 million pounds last November, 26.9 million pounds in December, 20.018 million pounds in January of this year, and 30.7 million pounds in February. April's production broke the post-war record, reaching 34.8 million pounds.

### Australia Supports US Proposal for Location of Peace Treaty with Japan

[Associated Press, Sydney, 26th] This place, the "Sun" newspaper published a Canberra correspondent's wire, said that Australian Foreign Minister Evatt is supporting the US motion to set Zhengang as the location for disarming and reaching a peace treaty with Japan.

### Soviet Scientists Survey Japanese Sea Fisheries

[Reuters, Moscow, 25th] A Soviet scientific team that went to the Sea of Okhotsk and the Sea of Japan to study fish resources departed from Leningrad for Sakhalin Island and the Kuril Islands today. They have four ships, and after arriving at their destination, they will be divided into fifteen groups to conduct research work in different areas.

### Little Progress in Japanese Cabinet Formation - Katayama Makes Last Effort, Democratic Party Drafts New Compromise Plan

[New Asia, Tokyo, 26th] Katayama's work to form a four-party coalition cabinet, the Katayama, Yoshida, and Ashida three-party summit held at 3:30 PM today, seems to be nearing the final effort stage. Liberal Party President Yoshiyu returned to Tokyo from Atami Onsen this morning and convened a meeting of the party's executives at 11:00 AM, during which he re-emphasized the established policy. After the meeting, Ono notified Nishio that the Liberal Party still refused to join the cabinet. At the same time, Katayama and Yoshida went through the handover procedures for the old and new prime ministers. After the procedures were completed, he invited Mr. Ashida to the Prime Minister's official residence to hold a three-party summit. The focus of the discussion was still: (1) not to disclose the secrets of the cabinet meeting, and (2) to avoid words and deeds that would cause social unrest. However, these two items have not yet been resolved in today's meeting, and it is scheduled to hold a three-party summit again tomorrow. Then the cabinet formation work will be delayed by another day. In this subtle development, the success or failure of organizing the United Four-Party Cabinet is difficult to predict. According to Nishio's statement after the meeting: "The possibility of a United Four-Party Cabinet was originally only 30%, but after today's three-party summit, it has increased to 50%."

[International News Agency, Tokyo, 6th] Democratic Party President Ashida told reporters: "During today's three-party summit, I and Prime Minister Katayama once taught the Liberal Party to cooperate in the four-party cabinet formation work. Yoshida replied that this matter must be discussed with the party before replying. Looking at the progress of the meeting, the Liberal Party's attitude has softened, and the Democratic Party will propose a compromise plan that can coordinate the relationship between the two parties, so the future of the four-party cabinet formation is expected to improve."

[International News Agency, Tokyo, 20th] Democratic Party President Amano and Koasaka Zentaro were recently commissioned by the party to draft a new agreement plan for the four parties. Based on the results of the three-party party head talks on the 26th, they started drafting a new compromise plan between the parties, and scheduled a party cadre meeting at 11:00 AM on the 27th to discuss the content, and then submitted it to President Ashida for discussion at the second three-party party head talks scheduled for the day.

### MacArthur Releases Occupation Report - Reviews Strength of Japanese Communist Party

[Associated Press, Tokyo, 25th] MacArthur recently released a report on the occupation of Japan, stating: "The strength of the Japanese Communist Party within the labor movement is difficult to determine, because the Communist Party often deliberately exaggerates its power. In fact, there are many organizations controlled by the Communist Party participating in the National Industrial Federation Congress. The National Industrial Federation Congress is organized similarly to the American Industrial Organizations Congress and is one of the two major labor organizations in Japan along with the National Labor Federation, with a total of 1.3 million members. The current strength of labor organizations in Japan is about 5 million people. In addition, Japanese farmers' organizations are also developing and are also related to the Communist Party. When the Farmers' Federation was organized in February last year, it only had 20,000 members, but now it has expanded to 1.2 million. Although the Communist Party only accounts for 1,000 of its 20,000 members, because the Communist Party has strict discipline and consistent action, its strength is greater than the number of people it occupies. In terms of Japanese politicians, the Communist Party's efforts to split the Socialist Party have now failed. The Socialist Party has exclusively dominated the police Liu in the recent general election, and its chairman Katayama Tetsuya has now been elected to organize the new Japanese cabinet. The general situation in Japan is most serious with economic problems, and political parties are now focusing on studying measures to encounter currency inflation and deal with the power of trade unions, so as to stabilize the relationship between prices and wages."

### Renaming the Imperial University, Abolishing Honorifics: Japan's "Democratization"

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 26th] The long-unconvened conference of presidents of Imperial Universities reconvened in Tokyo today and resolved: (1) to create another degree between Bachelor's and Doctoral degrees; (2) to abolish the word "Imperial" in university names, for example, changing Tokyo Imperial University to Tokyo University.

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 26th] After the meeting of the three parties, Prime Minister Katayama visited Speakers Matsuoka of the House of Representatives and Matsudaira of the House of Councillors. The Prime Minister proposed abolishing the title "Your Excellency." This term, traditionally used for high-ranking military officers and senior government officials, is thus being discontinued with the new Prime Minister's ascent to power.

### Aircraft Violates Albanian Airspace, Greek Officials Deny

[Agence France-Presse, Athens, 25th] The Greek Ministry of Propaganda has issued an official statement denying Albania's claim that Greece violated Albanian airspace and strafed its people with machine guns. It stated that Albania's malicious propaganda aims to divert world attention and influence the work of the United Nations Balkans Fact-Finding Committee on security measures and that no one will be fooled by it.

### Egyptian Prime Minister Leads Delegation to Security Council to Appeal Anglo-Egyptian Dispute

[Reuters, Cairo, 25th] The Egyptian Cabinet announced after a meeting that Prime Minister Nokrashy Pasha will personally lead a delegation to the United States to present Egypt's dispute with Britain over treaty revisions to the United Nations Security Council. Members of the delegation include Minister of Education Naguib Hilali, Minister of Commerce and Industry Ismail Sidky, Minister of Public Works, and Senator Ramzi. Egyptian Ambassador to the United States Hassan and Permanent Representative to the United Nations, Fawzi, will also be members of the delegation. The Prime Minister's departure date has not yet been determined.

### Severe Food Shortages in Soviet-Occupied North Korea, Large Numbers of Refugees Flee to South Korea, Some Refugees Granted Permission by Soviet Authorities

[Agence France-Presse, Seoul, 25th] The U.S.-Soviet Joint Commission is currently meeting here to decide the future of Korea, debating endlessly over procedural issues. Meanwhile, large numbers of refugees cross the border between the U.S. and Soviet occupation zones every night, entering the American zone in search of work and food. Seven temporary refugee camps have been established along the dividing line between the two zones, accommodating 4,000 refugees daily, sometimes even 6,000. An Agence France-Presse reporter visited the refugee camps today, finding eighty tents sheltering 10,000 refugees over the past ten days. Three-tenths of these refugees are between the ages of eighteen and forty, mostly from northern Korea, but some are from the northeastern border of China. Due to severe food shortages in the Soviet occupation zone, they are fleeing to the American zone. Some refugees came to the south with the permission of the Soviet authorities, but most crossed the border illegally. They all unanimously stated that Soviet guards rarely shoot at refugees. These refugees stay in the temporary camps for two or three days before being sent to their chosen destinations without any charge.

### U.S.-Soviet Commission Issues Communiqué

[Associated Press, Seoul, 26th] The U.S.-Soviet Joint Commission, discussing the issue of a Korean provisional government, issued a communiqué today stating that the meetings, which had been suspended for a year, resumed last week, and that communiqués will be issued at least once a week thereafter. This is the ninth communiqué, following up from a year ago, detailing the establishment of the commission and its agreed procedures. It also stated that the commission had examined the best way for the press to report on the progress of the meetings. Considering that the people of Korea and other countries have the right to be fully informed of the Joint Commission's work to establish a Korean provisional government, detailed joint communiqués will be issued at least once a week after each issue is resolved. The heads of both delegations also have the right to hold informal meetings with journalists to inform them of all facts that can be made public. The head of the U.S. delegation hosted reporters last Friday, and the Soviet representative also indicated that he would hold a press conference in the coming days.

### Anglo-American Negotiations Have Been Ongoing for Some Time, Planning to Raise German Industrial Standards, Developments After the Failure of the Foreign Ministers' Conference

[United Press, Washington, 25th] Regarding the Soviet Union's refusal to agree on the German question at the Moscow Conference, Britain and the United States are prepared to respond promptly. This Anglo-American move will first merge the western part of Germany and raise Germany's industrial standards, namely by increasing its steel production to double its current level. Anglo-American negotiations on this matter have been ongoing for some time since the Moscow Conference. This move is also likely to be Secretary of State Marshall's initial action, warning that the war-weary world can no longer tolerate the impasse on the German question. The current goal of Britain and the United States is to first increase Germany's production and promote its export trade so that it can pay for imported goods, thereby first enabling the Anglo-American occupation zones to be self-sufficient. Because the Soviet Union and France opposed German economic unification at the Moscow Conference, Britain and the United States have now decided to take this action within their occupation zones first. In fact, Germany's steel production and other industries are located in the Anglo-American occupation zones, especially the Ruhr region. Therefore, Britain and the United States may increase its annual steel production to 12 million tons. The exact number is still to be determined in the final agreement.

### Soviet Union Recruits 60,000 Scientists to Organize Mineral Prospecting Teams, Scale Unprecedented in Modern Nations

[United Press, Washington, 25th] Chairman of the House War Investigating Committee, Mr. Plumley, warned on the 25th that he had learned from authoritative sources that the Soviet Union had launched the largest mineral prospecting effort in history, involving as many as 60,000 scientists, engineers, and technicians, searching an area as large as 385,000 square miles. Plumley wrote to Mr. Millon, chairman of the Public Lands Subcommittee, that the Soviet Union had recruited scientific personnel in eighteen Soviet republics, forming eight hundred geographical exploration teams to search for oil, iron, fluorite, and other minerals. Plumley warned that the lack of natural resources may be the main cause of war and that the Soviet Union's actions are a challenge to the United States, with a scope of search that no other country can match. Stalin's production targets include 50 million tons of pig iron, 60 million tons of steel, 500 million tons of coal, and 160 million tons of oil. The Soviet Union is currently using the latest automatic drilling machines, which are twice as efficient as those used elsewhere.

[Reuters, Washington, 25th] Republican Senator Brewster said today that he had received accurate and reliable reports from the Soviet Union that the Soviet government and people were organizing a large-scale mineral search, on a scale unprecedented in modern nations. The report did not specify whether they were searching for uranium or other atomic fission materials. According to a former German army doctor, captured by the Soviet Union and now extradited to the United States to testify in a treason trial in Boston, the Soviet Union has acquired largely complete knowledge of atomic energy. The Soviet Union has stationed many German scientists on a remote island in the Black Sea to conduct research. Before his release, he met with these German scientists, and their knowledge coincided.

### Soviet Whaling Fleet Returns from Antarctica

[Central News Agency, Moscow, 25th (Combined Dispatch)] The Soviet Antarctic whaling fleet has begun to return home. They stayed in Antarctica for five months and caught a total of 500 whales.

### Welles Delivers Speech, Discussing Indian and Korean Issues, Hoping Leaders of Each Country Will Cooperate

[United Press, Washington, 25th] Former Undersecretary of State Welles delivered a weekly broadcast speech today stating that India and Korea cannot be truly independent unless the leaders of each country are willing to abandon their current difficulties and selfish ambitions and join the important task of promoting national welfare. It is regrettable that Rhee Syngman, the leader of the Korean Democratic Party, opposes the trusteeship system in Korea. Rhee and his conservative faction in southern Korea demand immediate independence. In fact, southern Korea can currently only achieve independence under a trusteeship agreement. Furthermore, after years of control by Japan and occupation by the United States and the Soviet Union, Koreans will not immediately assume the responsibilities and obligations of independence without facing political and economic chaos and prolonged civil war. Most leaders of Korean democratic parties are willing to work to establish a trusteeship system, believing that this is the only way to freedom. Secretary of State Marshall has obtained the agreement of Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov to resume negotiations by the U.S.-Soviet Joint Committee. This is a positive achievement. In addition, Marshall has indicated that the government will request an appropriation of $78 million to assist the people of southern Korea. This positive step is taken for the true benefit of the Korean people. As for the possibility of the division of India, unless all parties can establish practical methods to ensure that local self-governments are consistent with the management of the federation in terms of diplomacy, defense, finance, and banking, the concept of a new Indian nation should be abandoned.

### Italian Cabinet Formation Encountering Major Difficulties

[This Newspaper Report] London, 26th (Broadcast): Gasperi, who was commissioned to form a cabinet, reported to the Italian President today on his progress in forming a cabinet over the past two days, lasting ninety minutes. Afterwards, he refused to reveal whether he had accepted the cabinet order. Observers speculate that Gasperi must have encountered major difficulties in reconciling the opinions of various parties to form a national unity cabinet.

### Major Announcement to Be Made in the British and American Zones of Germany

[Associated Press, Rhein, Germany, 25th] British Minister in the Occupation Zone, Mr. Hangen, announced today that a major announcement will be made in the British and American occupation zones on the 27th. We can say that we are on the verge of a new era in history.

[Agence France-Presse, New York, 25th] Major General McCloy, Director of the Intelligence Bureau of the U.S. Military Government in Germany, returned here last night from Germany and told reporters that the biggest problem today is to teach the German people how to live peacefully with other countries in the world. However, the German people are currently struggling on the brink of starvation and are ready to jump on any bandwagon that can provide food. They have no confidence in their political leaders but turn to the Allied countries, relying on them to handle the situation until they can act freely.

### Viet Minh President Rejects French Ceasefire Proposal

[Agence France-Presse, Saigon, 26th] The Viet Minh radio station announced today that President Ho Chi Minh has rejected the ceasefire demand put forward by French Commissioner in Vietnam, Mr. Billotte. The radio station broadcast two appeals: one calling on the Vietnamese revolutionary army to fight to the end, and the other calling on the French to stop the bloodshed in Vietnam. Ho Chi Minh said that the French proposal is difficult to accept and is insulting because it stipulates that the Viet Minh army must disarm to the French army and allow the French army to move freely and station troops throughout Vietnam.

### Holy Land Investigative Team Meets, Representatives to Fly to Palestine Within Ten Days

[United Press, Lake Success, 25th] The United Nations will begin studying the Palestine issue on the 26th. Although there is some hope, there is no guarantee that a solution acceptable to the Jews, Arabs, and major powers will be achieved. The eleven-nation investigative committee consisting of Australia, Canada, Czechoslovakia, Guatemala, India, Iran, the Netherlands, Peru, Sweden, Uruguay, and Yugoslavia is responsible for investigating this most difficult political and social problem in the world. The representatives have gathered at the United Nations Headquarters, waiting for the opening of the investigation conference. The investigation is scheduled to be completed within ninety-eight days. United Nations Secretary-General Lie believes that the investigation of Palestine may affect the future fate of the United Nations and will deliver a brief opening address to the eleven-nation committee. After the opening of the eleven-nation committee, the representatives will elect the chairman and vice-chairman and discuss the investigation route. The investigation location will be Palestine, possibly including London, refugee camps throughout Europe, and the capitals of the Arab League countries. In addition to the eleven-nation representatives, the investigative committee will consist of fifty experts and consultants from various countries and fifty United Nations personnel, who will fly to Palestine within ten days. Before the departure of the eleven-nation committee, there will be a debate. The spokesperson for the Zionist Organization has requested that the committee visit the concentration camps for displaced people in Europe and Jewish exiles during the investigation, but the Arab leaders have vehemently opposed studying the immigration issue. The committee will hear the opinions of both the Arab and Jewish sides before deciding whether to go to Austria and Germany. The committee believes there is little hope that the Palestinian extremists will comply with the national request to implement a ceasefire during the investigation.

### Britain's Ten Conclusions on the Indian Question

[Reuters, London, 25th] Political figures believe that after repeated meetings between Governor-General of India Lord Mountbatten and British cabinet experts on India, ten conclusions have been reached: (1) June 1948 is determined as the deadline for Britain to withdraw from India; (2) Delaying the political situation will further deteriorate the internal political situation in India. Only an agreement between the two major parties can prevent the deterioration of the situation; (3) The future of the Indian army and civil service cannot be determined until a political solution is reached; (4) Delaying the political solution will further hinder the legislative process of the British side to transfer power to India. This legislative bill not only has Britain's approval of the transfer of power to India but also has the approval of the entire British Commonwealth of the transfer of power to India. The King's address when Parliament reopens must mention the Indian Act. There are only five months left until the address; (5) Britain will never withdraw from India or part of India in advance to prevent the danger of turmoil; (6) Britain must transfer power to one or several responsible authorities in India; (7) All future constitutional resolutions should be made by the Indians themselves. The Delhi conference on June 2 is to assist Indian responsible leaders in deciding on a unified or divided approach so that one or more authorities representing India can receive power from the British side; (8) The existing constituent assembly can be a representative body for the Congress Party, the Sikh community, and the monarchial native states, providing a referendum for Indian leaders. As for the Muslim League, due to its boycott of this constituent assembly, it is bound to establish another constituent assembly; (9) The rapid decision by the Indians themselves on their geographical boundaries will have a positive impact on the deteriorating situation and will allow British and Indian leaders to concentrate their efforts on other major issues related to the transfer of power; (10) The smooth progress of the transfer of power can enhance the position of the British Labor government, because there are still some people who oppose the Labor government's decision to withdraw from India.

### Black Man Brutally Murdered, Murderer Acquitted, American Newspaper Angrily Calls It a Shame for the Entire United States

[Associated Press, New York, 25th] In the case of the lynching of a black man, Willie Earle, by a white man in Greenville, South Carolina, the thirty-one defendants were acquitted by the local court. Although many white people in the southern states of the United States were happy, other parts of the world regarded it as a "mob trial." The number of defendants and the speed of the prosecution in this case are unprecedented in the judicial history of the southern states of the United States. Most of the defendants were taxi drivers, twenty-six of whom admitted to joining the crowd, kidnapping the black man, beating him severely, and finally shooting him to death. After the trial, three defendants were immediately ordered to be released, and the others were released after five hours and fifteen minutes of deliberation by the jury. The London Daily Express said that mob trials are still the unwritten law of the southern United States. However, newspapers far from the southern states also expressed dissatisfaction with this. The Richmond Times-Dispatch said that the entire South and the entire country will be disgraced by this verdict. The Atlanta Journal said that this is a government verdict and that the law has been lynched. The Memphis Commercial Appeal said that this is a tragic day for the justice of the American South. On July 25 last year, four black people were killed near Monroe, Georgia, by a mob of twenty white people. Although a reward of $30,000 was offered, none of the murderers have been brought to justice. The fate of black criminals is the opposite. Last Thursday, the local court in Sylvania, Georgia, tried a black man for raping a white woman. After only three minutes of discussion, the defendant, James white, was sentenced to death and will be executed by electric chair on June 17.

### French President and Prime Minister Appeal to the People, Coal and Electricity Strikes Still Deadlocked

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 26th] French President Auriol inspected Bish, Upper Savoy, and returned to Beijing today.

[Agence France-Presse, Annasi, France, 25th] French President Auriol, who is on a tour of the Alps, the former stronghold of French resistance, delivered a speech here today, accusing some people of trying to plunge France into turmoil and anarchy, and appealing to the people to maintain confidence and patience to assist the country's recovery.

[Agence France-Presse, Louhans, France, 25th] French Prime Minister Ramadier delivered a speech after arriving here today, appealing to the people to assist the government in carrying out France's reconstruction.

[United Press, Paris, 25th] The Electricity and Gas Workers' Union today defied government orders and announced a 24-hour strike on the 28th. Prime Minister Ramadier signed an order yesterday to requisition the state-owned gas and electricity industries to avoid the interruption of public utilities. Well-informed sources say that Ramadier is determined to ensure that this order does not become a dead letter.

### Japanese Also Conducted Research on Making Atomic Bombs

[This Newspaper Report] San Francisco, 26th (Broadcast): Mr. Shirose, who is investigating the damage caused by the atomic bomb in Japan, wrote in a bulletin published by atomic scientists that, according to prominent Japanese scientists, after the United States dropped the atomic bomb on Hiroshima, the Japanese tried their best to complete the atomic bomb experiment, but the result was a failure. Soon after the atomic bomb was dropped, the Japanese seemed to understand the nature of the atomic bomb and realized that they could not succeed in the experiment in the short term, so they abandoned all attempts.

[Associated Press, Cairo, 25th] The United States has agreed to grant Yemen a credit loan of one million U.S. dollars to purchase surplus U.S. military equipment. The loan is for a period of five years, repayable in installments.

### Solemn Opening of the Municipal Assembly, Speaker Prays for Peaceful Unification, Seeking National Stability Should Begin with Shanghai's Development, Mayor Asks Councilors to Jointly Maintain Local Security

[This Newspaper Report] The first session of the third meeting of the Municipal Assembly was solemnly opened at 9:00 a.m. yesterday in the main auditorium on the third floor of the Assembly Hall on Tanggu Road. Speaker Pan Gongzhan, Vice Speaker Xu Jilu, and 150 councilors attended. Mayor Wu, along with bureau chiefs and directors, Jiangsu Inspector Yan Zhuang, and Municipal Party Committee Chairman Fang Zhi, were also present. This meeting was held under a terrorist atmosphere in the society, so the mood in the meeting seemed more tense than the previous two meetings. Speaker Pan, Mayor Wu, and the councilors all expressed that the most important work and hope for us at present is to seek social stability and national peace. At this time and place, the responsibility of the Municipal Assembly will be even greater.

The meeting held the opening ceremony at 9:30 a.m. yesterday according to the newly-stipulated opening ceremony. First, Speaker Pan delivered the opening remarks, stating that today is the opening of the third meeting of this Assembly, coinciding with the National Political Council also holding a meeting. At a time when all parts of the country are calling for peace, the Communist Party is greatly disrupting and destroying transportation, causing economic depression and making people unable to live. Student movements have also sprung up one after another, causing social unrest and anxiety. Shanghai's economic and cultural position ranks first in the country. To seek national peace, unification, and social stability, it must first begin with Shanghai. Shanghai's social situation is closely related to the overall situation in China, so the responsibility of this Assembly will be even greater. In addition to discussing usual motions, deciding on budget expenditures, and reviewing the implementation of the resolutions of the first and second meetings, the most important thing in this meeting is "how to seek true peaceful unification of the national situation and how to seek social stability in Shanghai." Otherwise, if this chaotic situation is allowed to continue indefinitely, all hopes will be hindered, and discussing motions will be in vain. Therefore, we must do our best to solve these two major problems before we can "be worthy of the millions of citizens of Shanghai, be worthy of our own conscience!"

Mayor Wu then delivered a speech, saying that he had mentioned in the previous two meetings that 1947 would be the most difficult period for Shanghai, and now it seems that he was unfortunately correct. As the speaker said, the most important thing at present is to stabilize the society. The current turbulent situation in Shanghai has indeed threatened the peaceful and prosperous life of every citizen. Although the municipal government has done its best to eliminate unstable factors, its capabilities and energy are limited, and it cannot but ask the councilors for guidance and to propose general guidelines to make instability become stability and jointly maintain local security. Subsequently, Xi Yushu delivered a response on behalf of the councilors, stating that now that this meeting is opened, he has infinite feelings upon hearing what the speaker and mayor have said. The responsibility of the Municipal Assembly is even greater under such an unstable social situation. However, the responsibility for stability is not only on the mayor alone or the military police council, but is the responsibility of all citizens. The Municipal Assembly is a bridge between the citizens and the municipal authorities. We hope to safely overcome this dangerous period. In addition, there are several points of reflection: (1) The government should also bear part of the responsibility for the high prices reaching this level. It is hoped that the central government will pay attention to local conditions when deciding on policies in the future; (2) The municipal government's budget is affected by prices and it is difficult to balance. It is still hoped that the review of construction funds will be planned leniently in the future; (3) It has recently been heard that the central government has issued short-term high-interest treasury bonds, which will have a great impact on industry, commerce, and commercial banks. It is also hoped that colleagues will pay attention to this.

### Advise the Chinese Communist Party to Resume Peace Talks, Urge Students to Resume Classes Immediately, Two Urgent Motions Expected to Be Passed at the Preparatory Meeting

After the opening ceremony of the conference, there was a ten-minute break, and then the preparatory meeting was continued. First, the secretariat reported on the handling of various cases during the recess, and then six representatives, including Tang Shichang, were selected to draw the seat numbers of the councilors at the conference. Then, the discussion of two provisional motions began. (1) Vice Speaker Xu Jilu and 43 councilors, including Xi Yushu, proposed: "It is proposed that this Assembly advise the Chinese Communist Party to resume peace talks, students resume classes immediately, and support the government, maintain order, and promote permanent peace to seek national unification and social stability." (2) Councilors Zhang Zhongyuan, Tian Shujun, and 102 others proposed "Telegraph the Political Council and the municipal assemblies of provinces and cities to admonish the leaders of the Communist Party, immediately send personnel to Beijing to resume peace talks, turn hostility into friendship, and save the people from fire and water." Both cases were passed by the conference without objection, and it was decided that the secretariat of the municipal assembly would immediately prepare the text of the telegram to be reviewed and issued at today's conference.

### Five Measures

Regarding the aforementioned proposal, five measures are stipulated: (1) This council shall first telegraph all legal entities nationwide and call upon all people's organizations in this city to jointly telegraph the National Government and the National Political Council, advocating that the National Government promptly set a deadline, ordering the Chinese Communist Party to immediately lay down their arms, cease their rebellion, and await unified integration. If they can fulfill this as scheduled, they can be considered a political party and still be granted leniency, with the National Army immediately ceasing hostilities on the spot and refraining from further pursuit and suppression. Should they persist in their delusion and continue to engage in military actions, the government should concentrate all its efforts and issue a clear order for suppression, aiming for an early pacification, ending military operations, promoting national unification, and establishing lasting peace. Simultaneously, this council should unite with the public opinion organs of various provinces and cities to send another telegram to the CCP, sincerely delivering its final admonition. (2) This council shall immediately issue a public announcement advocating that all parties fulfill the agreed-upon withdrawal from schools, requesting parents of striking students to promptly advise and restrain their children, urging them to resume classes on a set date and not be exploited by villains to fall into legal traps. Furthermore, all school principals in the city, regardless of the number of students attending, are requested to immediately announce the official commencement of classes to set things right. For legitimate student demands that can be accommodated, this council, valuing education and caring for youth, should strongly urge educational administrative authorities and school authorities not to stubbornly adhere to preconceived notions but to consider the situation rationally and accept them, so that villains have no opportunity to exploit, and the student unrest can be quelled. (3) This council shall issue another public announcement endorsing the "Provisional Measures for Maintaining Social Order" promulgated by the National Government and the four implementing measures jointly formulated and promulgated by the Shanghai Municipal Government and the Garrison Headquarters, hoping for their effective implementation. (4) This council will send separate letters to the Shanghai Municipal Government and the Garrison Headquarters, expressing its support for the order to suspend the publication of newspapers in the city that intend to incite subversion of the government and disrupt public order, and requesting a ban on the re-publication of these newspapers. In the future, if any newspapers or publications contain similar content with the aim of subverting the government and disturbing society, the government should apply the same measures to maintain social order more easily. (5) This council shall immediately telegraph the above points to the councilors representing this city and those residing in this city and appointed by the National Government, urging them to unanimously advocate for these points in the National Political Council to meet the expectations of the people.

### Pseudo-Minister Jiang Hongjie Escorted Back to Country for Prosecution

Yao Minghui and Others Accused of Same Crime

Xu Chengen's Prosecution Dropped

### Owner of Minfeng Rice Shop Publicly Prosecuted for Hoarding Rice and Refusing to Sell

[Our Dispatch] Tang Qichang, the owner of Minfeng Rice Shop on Huangpi South Road, during the recent surge in rice prices, refused to sell fifty-two bags of rice stored in his shop, secretly transporting them to his residence at 153 Yanhai Road in the Nanshi area. Eighteen bags were hidden on the upper floor of the shop. After the local police station learned of this, Tang was arrested and handed over to the District Prosecutor's Office. After investigation, he was publicly prosecuted yesterday for violating the Food Management Regulations.

### Uniform Manufacturers Decide to Send Representatives to Petition, Requesting Winter Uniforms to Still Be Contracted to Businesses

### Student Unrest Unabated, Rice Crisis Rises Again, Mayor Frowns, Long Sigh

[Our Dispatch] Mayor Wu received reporters at the Municipal Government at 5:30 PM yesterday to report on the handling of the student unrest. A reporter asked what the mayor's response was to the student unrest not abating while a rice crisis was also rising. Mayor Wu frowned and shook his head repeatedly upon hearing this, and sighed deeply, saying, "This is terrible." He continued, saying that he had been preoccupied with the student unrest for days, leaving him with no time to attend to the rice crisis. However, the Municipal Government had already decided on a countermeasure, namely, to have the Social Affairs Bureau thoroughly implement rice rationing. This month, 180,000 dan of rice will be rationed to schools, factories, government agencies, and organizations, and the number will gradually be increased to 300,000 dan per month. Although this amount is not enough to supply the entire city's population, it will be enough for agencies and organizations. As for the issue of rice rationing for the poor, it still requires a strict investigation by the authorities before a decision can be made.

### Prospects for Student Unrest Not Optimistic, Another Demonstration and Petition This Morning

[Central News Agency] The student unrest in the city originally showed signs of improvement yesterday. When Mayor Wu went to Jiaotong University yesterday afternoon to respond to the demands of student representatives, the students guaranteed that as long as their demands (see Mayor Wu's report to reporters on page five) could be satisfactorily answered, all striking schools would resume classes tomorrow (i.e., today). The students expressed satisfaction with Mayor Wu's response. At the same time, all the students arrested by the Garrison Department the day before yesterday have been released. If the students can fulfill their promise, all striking schools should resume classes today. However, student representatives who insisted on striking held a meeting at Jiaotong University last night and still decided to hold a petition demonstration at 8:00 AM this morning. Therefore, although the government authorities are making every effort to show leniency to quell the student unrest, the prospects for the student unrest are still difficult to be optimistic due to the manipulation and instigation of a small number of students.

At 10:00 AM yesterday, Datong University encountered opposition from many Anhui students during a discussion on the issue of "flexible strikes," which led to a brawl and some injuries. The Jiangning Road Police Station dispatched police to the scene and took twelve students involved and injured to the station for questioning.

Moreover, after the arrested students of Fudan University were released and returned to school yesterday afternoon, the students who insisted on striking held a welcoming meeting and brutally beat many classmates who advocated for resuming classes, causing public outrage among the righteous students in the school.

### Passenger and Freight Rates on All Shipping Lines to Be Determined by Trade Association Negotiations, Council Held Emergency Joint Meeting, Representatives Sent to Beijing to Present Truth About Shipping Industry Crisis

Du Yuesheng, Chairman of the Shanghai Shipping Association, convened an emergency joint meeting of directors and supervisors at the China & South Sea Bank yesterday afternoon to address the current shipping industry crisis. Secretary-General first reported that the shipping industry is currently facing difficulties due to low freight rates and rising shipping costs. The quota for ship fuel oil is also too small, making it impossible for more than half of the ships to obtain fuel. Various shipping companies are in critical condition. He requested a joint effort to find a solution to avoid the interruption of transportation. After a detailed review by the directors and supervisors, it was resolved that: (1) Starting from June 1, passenger and freight rates on all shipping lines will be determined through negotiations by trade associations. (2) Salaries for crew members in May will be calculated at 11,000 times the base wage, and salaries for technical workers will be calculated at 14,000 times the base wage. (3) The government is requested to relax the fuel oil quota for ships. The monthly quota for state-owned and private ships should be at least 30,000 tons. Representatives Hu Shiyuan, Zhong Shandao, and others will immediately go to Beijing to present the truth about the current shipping industry crisis and solutions to the government and the National Political Council. Subsequently, the discussion turned to the issue of the Water Transport Brigade's ships competing for cargo, which harms the domestic shipping industry. Director Liu Hongsheng, in his capacity as the Executive Director of the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), briefly explained UNRRA's attitude towards the Water Transport Brigade. The establishment of the Water Transport Brigade was initially a last resort because domestic ships were insufficient to meet the demand and the transportation of relief supplies was difficult. In the past six months, the number of Chinese merchant ships has increased sharply, and cargo tonnage has exceeded demand. The transportation of commercial goods and relief supplies is very convenient and there are no obstacles. Since the situation has changed, the government does not want the relief work that benefits the country and the people to become an obstacle to the recovery and development of the domestic shipping industry. It is hoped that the shipping industry will recommend representatives to discuss the follow-up measures with UNRRA and the Water Transport Brigade. Representatives were then appointed to discuss the handling of the Water Transport Brigade's ships. Finally, regarding the government's fundraising for US dollar bonds, the directors and supervisors unanimously agreed that the shipping industry is already facing a serious crisis and is indeed unable to donate. However, because it concerns the national economy, they reluctantly agreed to subscribe for US$50,000 in US dollar bonds, equivalent to 600 million yuan in national currency, to show the shipping industry's patriotism.

The Songshan District Fire Department dispatched vehicles to the scene and made every effort to extinguish the fire. Subsequently, the Central Fire Department also dispatched several vehicles. However, the buildings there were all made of flammable wood and plywood, with many shops inside selling food and celluloid toys, so once it caught fire, it could not be extinguished. At that time, most of the shopkeepers were asleep. Hearing the fire alarm, they hurriedly got up and fled for their lives, in a very chaotic situation. The Songshan Police Department dispatched a large number of police officers to maintain order at the scene. The fire was extinguished after about an hour. One elderly woman was killed in the fire.

### Automobiles Prohibited from Stopping Arbitrarily on Tracks Next to Tram Stops

There are many automobiles on Nanjing East Road, from Zhongshan East Road to Xizang Road. Every time there is a red light, automobiles arbitrarily stop at streetcar stops, making it impossible for streetcars behind them to stop at the platform, thus making it more and more difficult for passengers to get on and off. Commuters are more delayed and traffic becomes more congested. The Bureau of Public Utilities has already stipulated that rickshaws are prohibited from running on this road from 8:00 AM to 2:00 PM. During this time, strict enforcement can be carried out to prohibit automobiles from arbitrarily stopping on the tracks next to streetcar platforms in order to facilitate traffic.

### This Month's Index Strives for Rational Accuracy, No Rice for Employees, Based on Xian Rice

[Our Dispatch] Wu Kaixian, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, stated yesterday that the calculation of this month's cost of living index: The types and weights of the items have not changed from before. The rice item in the workers' index is calculated based on a family of three. Recently, workers can get two buckets of rationed rice per month, so the basis for calculating the rice price is one-third of the rationed rice price, and the remaining two-thirds is the average price of Xian rice in the market. Since employees do not enjoy rationed rice, their index is based on the market price of Xian rice. The recently established Cost of Living Index Compilation and Review Committee is scheduled to meet on the 30th. The May cost of living index will be announced after it has been reviewed and approved. The index will strive to be reasonable and accurate.

### Gold Rush Case Retrial: Central Bank Gold Allocation Accounts Inconsistent with Tong Feng Yu's

[Our Newspaper] The Gold Rush case, watched nationwide, saw the court summon former Business Bureau Chief of the Central Bank, Lin Fengbao, Deputy Bureau Chief Yang Anren, and Chairman of the Shanghai Gold Industry Association, Zhan Liansheng, for a preliminary hearing on the 4th of last month. Yesterday at 2 PM, the court again summoned the three defendants, Lin, Yang, and Zhan, for a second hearing presided over by Judge Wang Jiachuo. Witnesses summoned included former Chairman of the Gold Industry Association Xu Busun, former Assistant Manager and Chief Teller of the Central Bank Business Bureau Wang Songtao, as well as Ni Zuguang, Xie Bingquan, Lang Liejin, Gu Luofa, Feng Qing'an, Lu Anru, Shi Hede, and Zhang Pijun, totaling ten people. Defense lawyers included Chen Tingrui, Duanmu Kai, Shan Yuhua, Yu Zhongluo, and Fang Fushu, totaling eight people. The public gallery was packed, with every seat filled. Five bundles of account books, large and small, were piled on the table, totaling over ninety volumes. The hearing lasted for three hours, from 2 PM to 5 PM. The court adjourned and rescheduled the retrial, with Lin and Yang released on their original bail, and Zhan remaining in custody.

Lin Fengbao Testifies He Was Acting Under Orders

After the court opened yesterday, court recorder Feng Duanxiang first read the record of the previous hearing, then proceeded to individual questioning. The first defendant, Lin Fengbao, testified that the 400-tael gold bricks were imported from the United States, received by the Teller Section of the Business Bureau, then delivered to Tong Feng Yu to be melted into bars, and then returned to the Central Bank, where the Teller Section allocated and sold them to Tong Feng Yu, Tai Kang Yuan, Da Feng Heng, Fang Jiuxia, and Yang Qinghe five firms. Sometimes, to save procedures, Tai Kang Yuan and the other four firms would directly receive the allocated gold bars from Tong Feng Yu, but they had to settle accounts with the Central Bank on the same day. There were two types of allocations: open allocations and concealed allocations. The amount of open allocations was known around 10 AM, while the amount of concealed allocations was not known until the books were closed at 6 or 7 PM in the evening. Gold transactions were reported to the superiors every day, and there were inventory lists available for inspection. The bank's audit department also regularly audited the accounts and checked the inventory. In response to the court's question about the importance of gold purchasing fees, and why gold was delivered based solely on receipts without first preparing the vouchers, Lin replied that preparing vouchers was an internal procedural matter that the defendant had no authority to interfere with, and that he was merely acting under the orders of President Bei. At this point, the court summoned witness Wang Songtao for questioning. Wang stated: "The allocation slips were signed by Deputy Director Yang. The allocation amount was not known until 5 or 6 PM. Gold bars were paid out based on the receipts from gold and silver shops. This was under the direction of Deputy Director Yang."

Significant Discrepancies in Gold Allocation Accounts

The court then turned to questioning Lin Fengbao, to verify the results of comparing the accounts of the Central Bank and Tong Feng Yu. The discrepancies were significant, with the Central Bank's accounts showing less and Tong Feng Yu's accounts showing more. For example, on January 4th, there was a difference of 58 bars, on the 8th, 45 bars, on the 9th, 112 bars, on the 10th, 115 bars, on the 11th, 25 bars, on the 14th, 27 bars, on the 15th, 45 bars, on the 16th, 46 bars, on the 17th, 40 bars, on the 18th, 87 bars, on the 20th, 120 bars, on the 21st, 146 bars, on the 22nd, 86 bars, on the 23rd, 95 bars, on the 24th, 300 bars, and on the 25th, 475 bars. What was the reason for this? Lawyer Duanmu Kai requested that the court send a letter to the Central Bank for a thorough investigation to reveal the truth. The court expressed dissatisfaction that the account books sent by the Central Bank were all loose-leaf pages. Lin also found them to be perfunctory, but stated that the Central Bank's accounting department was staffed by personnel dispatched by the National Government's Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics, and that he had no authority to interfere.

Inconsistent Testimony in Two Instances

The second defendant, Yang Anren, was then summoned to testify. He stated that the applications and receipts from gold and silver shops were handled separately, and that there was a transaction slip for each day's transactions, with the chairmen of the gold and silver industries receiving the allocated gold bars. Witness Wang Songtao was then cross-examined, and because Wang's testimony was inconsistent in the two instances, the court was quite angry. Wang hurriedly admitted his mistake, saying that he had not heard clearly. The court continued to question Yang, who admitted that the daily allocation amounts were under his direction. Regarding the account books sent by the Central Bank to the court, he stated that they were draft accounts, and that there were official account books (inventory accounts) in the accounting department, and that these loose-leaf accounts were a new style. The third defendant, Zhan Liansheng, was then summoned to testify. He stated that from last year until January 27th of this year, Tong Feng Yu was responsible for the allocation and sale. After January 27th, the Central Bank was directly responsible for the allocation and sale, with Tong Feng Yu responsible for melting. As for the discrepancy on the January 27th account, where the Central Bank recorded 1820 bars and Tong Feng Yu only recorded 820 bars, a difference of 1000 bars, the reason was that due to the morning and afternoon relationship, there was not enough time to settle the accounts, so the 1000 bars were transferred to the next day for payment. The court questioned why the Central Bank's January 27th account clearly stated that the money and goods were received and paid clearly, Zhan stammered. At this point, witness Xu Busun, former Chairman of the Gold Industry Association, testified: "I served as chairman of the association from the 16th year of the Republic until the reorganization after the victory in the 34th year, when Zhan Liansheng succeeded me. Last year, Central Bank President Bei Zuyi approached me to ask for my help with the allocation and sale of gold. I replied that I was no longer qualified. Later, Zhan Liansheng contacted Lin Fengbao and Yang Anren to handle this matter. It was not introduced by me, I only offered a little advice. Zhan has never lost credit, the rest I do not know." The court hearing ended here. After the defendants and witnesses signed their statements, the retrial was rescheduled.

### Mayor Wu Mediates Student Unrest: Arrested Students Released Yesterday; Professors from Fudan and Other Schools Offer Opinions, Mayor Expresses Agreement

[Our Newspaper] Yesterday, students from Jiaotong University planned to march to the Municipal Government to request the release of their arrested classmates, and first sent representatives to visit Mayor Wu. Upon receiving the news, Mayor Wu went to Jiaotong University in Xujiahui at 12:15 PM, stating that the arrested students could be claimed by the school or their parents. As for the eleven students detained from Shanghai Law School, because there was evidence of inciting strikes and market closures, they must wait for judicial proceedings. However, he promised that within three days after the students resumed classes, he would negotiate with the court and the Ministry of Justice on their behalf, and according to legal provisions, if the crime was punishable by a maximum sentence of five years or less, he could find a way to release them on bail.

Mayor Approves Five Points

At the same time, at the request of the students, Mayor Wu immediately approved five points: (1) All students arrested in recent days will be released uniformly before 5:00 PM yesterday (the 26th). (2) Injured students will be treated free of charge by the Municipal Government. (3) The military and police shall not enter the school without the consent of the school. (4) Student meetings within the school shall not be interfered with if permitted by the school. (5) Severely punish the murderers (but there must be witnesses and physical evidence). The students have agreed to resume classes today. At 5:00 PM in the afternoon, Mayor Wu met with reporters from various newspapers in the Municipal Government conference room and announced the situation of mediating the student unrest at Jiaotong University as above.

Professors' Four Opinions

Also: Zhang Zhirang, Dean of the Law School of Fudan University, professors Qiu Hansheng, Gu Zhongyi, Sun Dayu, Lv Yuzhui, Sun Zeying of Jiaotong University, Shen Tilan of St. John's University, Jiao Tong of Shanghai Law School, and Cao Weifeng of Jinan University, and other nine people jointly visited Mayor Wu at the Municipal Government yesterday afternoon to request the release of the arrested students from various schools. At that time, Mayor Wu stated that the students had agreed to resume classes, and the arrested students could be released around 5:00 PM. The professors all felt satisfied, but put forward four opinions to Mayor Wu: (1) Instruct the relevant agencies that future disputes in various schools should be resolved within the school. (2) Local authorities should avoid intervening, and military and police should not be dispatched unless they are related to public security and without notification from the school authorities. (3) School authorities should focus on persuasion when dealing with student unrest. (4) Students should use reasoned methods for disputes and avoid using force. Mayor Wu expressed his agreement and asked the professors to advise the students to abide by their promises and resume classes on the 27th. The professors left at 4:45 PM.

### All Students Released on Bail Separately

[Our Newspaper] Ninety students from Jiaotong, Tongji, Fudan, and other schools who were sent to the Garrison Headquarters for detention were gradually released on bail yesterday by their parents and principals. By 6:40 PM, all had been released from the Garrison Headquarters. In the morning, two students from New Construction Middle School were released on bail by their parents. Around 5:00 PM in the afternoon, Jiaotong University President Wu Baofeng, accompanied by Xie Renzhao, Secretary-General of the Municipal Party Department, went to the Garrison Headquarters to complete the bail procedures. Tongji University President Dong Xifan and Li Ximou, Deputy Director of the Municipal Education Bureau, also rushed to the scene one after another. The Jiaotong University students were initially unwilling to leave prison because two students from New Construction Middle School who were also detained did not have parents in Shanghai and no one could bail them out for a while, so they insisted on being released together. President Wu and Secretary-General Xie and others rushed to arrange the matter, and the Garrison Headquarters finally agreed to release them all. At 6:20 PM, the students walked out of the detention center in two batches. At that time, there were two school buses each from Jiaotong University and Tongji University, and dozens of students waiting outside the gate of the Garrison Headquarters. When the arrested students walked out of the gate, firecrackers were set off loudly, and they embraced each other and shouted loudly, then boarded the bus and drove away from the Garrison Headquarters at 6:40 PM, singing songs such as "Unity is Strength" along the way.

[Another Dispatch] Just as the Jiaotong University students were released, two red police vehicles of the Police Bureau drove into the square of the Garrison Headquarters one after another. The vehicles contained dozens of students from Datong and Jinan Universities arrested by the Jiangning Branch and other branches that day. However, the Garrison Headquarters did not detain them. After Commander Xuan discussed the matter, they were driven back to the Police Bureau for their own handling.

### Commander Xuan Issues Statement: Hopes Released Students Will Not Make Trouble Again

[Central News Agency] Yesterday afternoon at 7:00 PM, Garrison Commander Xuan Tiewu met with reporters and issued a statement on the "student unrest issue," stating in brief: (1) A number of school students were arrested for violating martial law. After the presidents of various schools requested bail separately, a total of 90 students were released before 7:00 PM, including 40 from Jiaotong University, 39 from Tongji University, 5 from Fudan University, and 6 from New Construction Middle School. When the presidents of various schools requested bail, they stated that these students could resume classes after returning. The military and police authorities detained these students who incited student unrest, also hoping that they would no longer make trouble and return to school to study, so they were agreed. (2) If these students cannot restore order to the school after returning, and continue to go outside the school to engage in incitement and propaganda that disrupts local order, they will still be arrested, and bail will no longer be easily granted at that time. (3) Before yesterday, a small number of the arrested students were conspiratorial instigators, who were sent to the court for questioning. Most were not. (4) Political issues are very complex and can never be resolved by making noise and shouting, let alone be immediately improved by people with insufficient knowledge and experience using a simple method. If students are interested in politics, they should study more at this time so that they can recognize clearly and make more contributions when they engage in politics in the future. (5) The students shouted slogans, posted slogans, and went on strike and demonstrations, all for the sake of "anti-civil war." Who should be responsible for the civil war should be clarified first. The obvious fact today is that the Communist Party is creating chaos, so the government is suppressing the chaos. I admire the students for opposing the civil war, but they should oppose the civil war with the Communist Party (the real responsible party for the civil war) to be effective. (6) Now conspirators are still preparing to incite the "May 30th" and "June 2nd" general strike, general market closure, and general strike movement. Their attempts will definitely fail because anyone in Shanghai today most needs stability and a good social order and will never sympathize with these conspirators to disrupt order, and will definitely express firm opposition. (7) There is absolutely no problem with the overall security of Shanghai. If necessary, unspoken martial law will be announced.

### Student Representatives from Beijing Normal College Decide to Come to Shanghai and Transfer to Nanjing to Petition

President Yuan Luidun's Attempts to Dissuade Were Ineffective

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 26th] Yuan Luidun, President of National Beiping Normal College, told reporters on the 25th that the quality of normal education does not lie in the difference between independent colleges and university titles, but in whether they strive to run the school well. According to reports: Students who demand "restoration of the university" will send five representatives to Nanjing to personally state the reasons for the restoration of the university to the Ministry of Education and request the Political Participation Council to urge the government to implement the council's resolution in the 34th year to restore the normal university. My repeated attempts to dissuade them were ineffective. In addition, the "Restoration of the University Committee" of the college selected five representatives to go to Nanjing to petition. Three of them went to Tianjin on the 24th, and the remaining two went to Tianjin on the morning of the 25th, and took a ship to Shanghai and then transferred to Nanjing.

### Military Police Prevent Student Petition: Team Member Injured in the Head and Bleeding; More Than 20 Leading Students Arrested on the Spot

[Our Newspaper] Yesterday at noon, a group of students from Jinan, Fudan, Tongji, Music Academy, and Commercial Shipping College, totaling more than 800 people, gathered at Jinan University on Baoshan Road, intending to petition the Municipal Government in the afternoon, demanding the release of the students from various schools who had been arrested in recent days. The Second Brigade of the 202nd Division of the Qingnian Army in the city, the Mobile Vehicle Brigade of the Police Headquarters, and the North Station Branch in charge, were ordered to send personnel to the school to dissuade the students from petitioning. The students sang songs and shouted slogans in the school, and many people stood on the walls or in front of the windows, wantonly insulting the military and police who were dissuading them from petitioning. The military and police tried their best to endure, and after a stalemate until 6:30 PM, dozens of male and female students took the lead, intending to rush out of the school gate. The military and police stepped forward to stop them, but to no avail. They then tried to ease the situation and retreated slightly. At this time, the students in the school gate threw bricks and debris at the military and police. Wang Zhicheng, a member of the inspection team, was injured in the head and bleeding, and Zhao Zhengqi, Lin Weichuan, He Zhenqiu, and others were also slightly injured. At this point, the military and police could no longer bear it, and arrested more than 20 leading students, including Ye Dapei, and transferred them to the Garrison Headquarters for interrogation. Other students fled or hid in the school. The Baoshan Road area was temporarily under martial law, and passage was prohibited. The military and police withdrew at 11:00 PM. Last night, the person in charge of Jinan University and the military and police authorities discussed the aftermath at the Xinhua Villa.

### Beiyang Professors' Association Opposes Moving the Beiping Branch to Tianjin, Explaining Four Reasons

[Central News Agency Beiping, 26th] The Professors' Association of the Beiping Branch of National Beiyang University, in order to oppose the relocation of the Beiping Branch to Tianjin, issued a declaration after a resolution by the plenary meeting, explaining five reasons for opposition: (1) If the Beiping Branch is merged into the Tianjin School, then Beiping will only have two engineering colleges, Tsinghua and Peking University, while Tianjin already has four engineering colleges, Beiyang, Nankai, Industry and Commerce, and Hebei. This seems inconsistent with the principle of large-scale balanced distribution of departments and reasonable development. (2) Students of the three engineering colleges in Beiping account for more than 45% of the Beiping Branch. The existing equipment of the Beiping Branch is the most complete because it has not been affected by the war. In terms of history, the Beiping Branch is also the oldest. If it is all moved to Tianjin, it is tantamount to announcing the end of the engineering college in Beiping with the longest history, the best equipment, and the largest number of people. (3) Last autumn, the number of applicants for new students in various schools was three to twenty-two in Tianjin and Beiping, that is, the number of applicants in Beiping was six times that of Tianjin, which shows the interest of Beiping youth in engineering. (4) The relocation of the Beiping Branch to Tianjin, its books, instruments, and factory dismantling and transportation, estimated at current prices, will require more than 10 billion yuan. It is considerable to use this huge amount of money to develop industrial education or to enrich Tianjin schools. It seems too wasteful to use it only for relocation. (5) Industrial construction is extremely important to make China a modern country. The original engineering schools should be maintained, expanded, cultivated, and built. Merging the Beiping Branch with Tianjin is tantamount to abolishing a school with a historical foundation.

### Tongji Freshman College Still Holds Classes as Usual

### Executive Yuan Will Discuss Exchange Settlement Methods for Self-Funded Overseas Studies This Month

[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 26th] The government attaches great importance to the issue of exchange settlement for self-funded overseas students and has decided to facilitate self-funded students within a possible scope. The exchange rate is urgently needed to be decided. It is reported that the Executive Yuan will convene the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Finance on the 30th of this month to discuss the method. Relevant sources revealed that the state's foreign exchange is extremely precious. It is impossible to settle exchanges at 3,350 yuan according to the request of self-funded students, but if foreign exchange is settled at the government official price of 1,200 yuan, most self-funded students will not be able to afford it, so it is possible to take a compromise number between these two numbers.

### Giant Encas Organizes Allied Forces to Challenge the Chung Lun Team

The Chung Lun basketball team's second eastern expedition has achieved great victories in six matches in Shanghai, making their record brilliant. Recently, as the team has not yet returned from their tour in Xiamen with the Hua Lun team, the visiting teams, in addition to practicing daily at the gymnasium, have mostly stayed indoors. It is reported that the Western youth team Giants and Encas, having suffered painful defeats at the hands of the Chung Lun team, are still unwilling to accept their losses. After consultations, they have decided to form a mixed allied force to challenge the Chung Lun team again before the Hua Lun team returns to Shanghai. Yesterday, according to Wu Jian, the leader of the Chung Lun team, the team is willing to accept the challenge from the foreign teams. However, the players have been too tired from the past six matches and need to rest. They will wait for the return of the maritime champions from Shanghai before deciding the outcome. Therefore, the match against the Western allied team will have to wait until after the match with the Hua Lun team. If time permits, they will decide whether to accept the game.

It is also reported that the Shantou team, organized by the Shantou native association, also suffered a defeat to the visiting team and is quite unwilling to concede defeat. They are also planning to issue another challenge, but it is said that the Chung Lun team has been away from its base for too long and may not be able to make it in time.

### Ping Pong League Match

Lianxing Wins One Division Final Spot

The second Shanghai Ping Pong League match saw intense competition in each game last night. In the third division, Post Office B defeated strong rival Xinsheng Hong six to one, maintaining their undefeated record. Although the Hua Lun Women's team in the fourth division suffered consecutive defeats to Siming A and Qingdao, all the female players attended, demonstrating excellent sportsmanship. Lin Jinlan's smashes, Zhou Ruihua, Hu Jiahe's defensive chops, their techniques and postures are no less than those of their male counterparts. Another match was between Lianxing and Hangzhou Silk Industry in the first division. The meeting of two undefeated armies was exceptionally fierce. Lianxing's strength was affected by the absence of key players Hu Yiping and Wu Zuochang. Silk Industry seized the opportunity, fought desperately. Yang Changxi and Zhong Xianfang were especially brave. After fierce battles, the two teams tied at three apiece. In the final match, Lianxing's lucky star, Fan Liangji, relied on his steady attack and defeated opponent Lin Changxin three to one. Lianxing reversed the situation, won four to three, and won the finals spot. They will await the winner of the Shanghai Star vs. Silk Industry match to compete for the championship of that division. There will be two more matches tonight, with Taishan facing Zhao Yi in the third division, which will be a fierce battle.

### Carson in Hong Kong

One Set Lost to Ye Guanxiong

[Our Hong Kong Dispatch] Shanghai tennis star Carson showed his skills at the Cricket Ground the day before yesterday, meeting people from Hong Kong and China.

At the beginning of the second set, the weather turned bad, and it rained non-stop, making the court slippery, forcing the game to stop. The performance of both sides was very exciting, and the battle was very intense. The unstable ground often caused mistakes.

### Civil Food Allocation Committee Held Preparatory Meeting Yesterday; Leaders Exchanged Opinions, Concrete Measures Not Yet Decided

Mayor Wu, to ensure the speedy and thorough supply of food for the citizens, suggested establishing a Civil Food Allocation Committee in the city to be responsible for the city's food allocation and distribution. Since the Minister of Food came to Shanghai last week to discuss with relevant authorities, it has been decided to establish it within the week. At 10 AM yesterday, a preparatory meeting was held at the Shanghai General Warehouse of the Ministry of Food. The attendees were Vice Minister Pang and Counselor Ye of the Ministry of Food, Director Ye of the General Warehouse, Director Gu and Section Chief Ji of the Social Affairs Bureau, Secretary Ren of the Central Bank, and six others. The meeting lasted until 1 PM.

After the meeting, according to Director Ye of the General Warehouse, the preparatory meeting formulated measures for the name, powers, participating units, and amount of rice to be allocated, which need to be submitted to President Zhang of the Executive Yuan for approval. A decision should be made today. The General Warehouse has Siamese rice for allocation in the city. White rice and broken rice will not be mixed. The rumored price is 168,000 yuan, but this Siamese rice was purchased at black market prices in the local area, so the cost is high. Whether to sell it at a lower price is subject to the decision of Mayor Wu, Minister Gu, and President Zhang.

Another report: Yesterday afternoon, President Zhang and others exchanged views again at the Central Bank. In the evening, Mayor Wu and Director Wu also participated in the discussion. It is reported that concrete measures have not yet been agreed upon. The Ministry of Food intends to hand over the civil food allocation affairs to the local government.

Rice Prices Rise Again by Four or Five Levels

[Our Report] Because the weather cleared up, there were more goods arriving in the rice market. Yesterday, the North and South markets received 6,697 shi and 6 dou. Sellers, because the rising winds in the producing areas had not subsided, held their goods at higher prices, so the market continued to rise, increasing by 20,000 to 30,000 yuan compared to last Saturday. The selling price of high-quality white rice has exceeded 450,000 yuan, causing considerable panic among the people.

It is reported that at 10 AM yesterday, the price of rice in Wuxi was once quoted at 440,000 yuan, but by noon it had plummeted to 380,000 to 390,000 yuan. This abnormal phenomenon was entirely due to an unstable base. Wu Kaixian, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, told reporters yesterday that he had asked the Ministry of Food not to purchase in the producing areas anymore, otherwise the rice prices in both rural and urban areas would not be able to be suppressed. The only way to fundamentally solve the problem is to quickly ship in foreign rice.

High-quality white rice was not traded in the South Market yesterday, with a quoted price of 425,000 yuan. In the North Market, high-quality rice was traded at 422,000 yuan. Thin rice was quoted at 422,000 to 430,000 yuan.

Yesterday, wheat bran rose sharply in the morning market, but returned to normal at the close, rising by 10,000 yuan. Bean cake also advanced and retreated sharply, rising by 4,000 to 5,000 yuan.

Red beans had no formal market price, soaring by 20,000 to 30,000 yuan. Corn was being processed by alcohol factories, rising by 10,000 yuan. Sorghum wine shops were also greedy, rising by more than 10,000 yuan. Raw peanuts were being sucked up by foreign firms and local streets, soaring by 20,000 to 30,000 yuan. Sesame seeds were being bought up by foreign firms and local streets, soaring by 20,000 yuan.

[Our Report] The prices of rice allocated to factories and schools in the city were finalized yesterday morning by the Ministry of Food, the Central Trust Bureau, the Social Affairs Bureau, and other relevant agencies, set at 240,000 yuan per shi for rice and 168,000 yuan for broken rice. The first batch of applicants approved by the Social Affairs Bureau for allocation included 220 schools and more than 150 factories. The Social Affairs Bureau is scheduled to issue notices today, and the units can pay and exchange for rice withdrawal certificates tomorrow, and then withdraw rice from the Shanghai General Grain Warehouse of the Ministry of Food.

Another report: The Zhaoshangju Haichen wheel has left Calcutta and arrived in Yangon and is currently loading 7,000 tons of rice entrusted by the Central Trust Bureau. As soon as the loading is completed, it will return to Shanghai as soon as possible. The Haitian wheel arrived in Calcutta on May 21 and is loading more than 9,000 tons of remaining materials entrusted by the Materials Supply Bureau. In addition, the Zhaoshangju Haihuang wheel left Shanghai yesterday and sailed to Qinhuangdao Huludao, and the Haiqian wheel is scheduled to sail from Shanghai to Keelung and then to Shantou today.

150,000 Tons of Foreign Rice Approved for Allocation

[Our Report] It is reported that the World Food Conference has approved the allocation of a total of 150,000 tons of foreign rice to our country for June, July, August, and September of this year. The rice supply areas are divided into 30,000 tons from Burma and 20,000 tons from Siam for June. For June, July, and August, 40,000 tons from the United States and 10,000 tons from a country in South America. For July, August, and September, a total of 50,000 tons from Burma and Siam. It is said that the price of Burmese and Siamese rice is 100 US dollars per ton. The price of American rice is 300 US dollars per ton. Therefore, the estimated cost of all allocated food is approximately US$25 million. It is also said that our country is currently planning to purchase 100,000 tons of rice and 200,000 tons of wheat from the United States, which will also require a price of approximately US$45 million. It is understood that the handling of these foreign foods is entrusted to the Central Trust Bureau. The huge foreign exchange expenditure required is expected to be exempt from the quota limit and will be raised separately by the government. It is hoped that the 50,000 tons of rice from Burma and Siam will arrive in Shanghai first next month.

### Flour Industry Association to Handle Allocation of Discounted Flour; Approximately 7,000 Bags Can Be Allocated Daily

[Our Report] Regarding the allocation of discounted flour in the city, the Ministry of Food has sent an official letter to the Municipal Government, requesting the Central Trust Bureau to supply 40,000 bags (70 pounds each) of Libeng foreign flour per week to the Flour Business Association for resumption of allocation. The Flour Association originally planned to resume allocation starting today. However, since the official letter from the Social Affairs Bureau has not yet arrived, it will likely be delayed until tomorrow. From then on, allocation will be carried out for six days a week, with approximately 7,000 large bags allocated daily. It is understood that the target of this allocation will be limited to various manufacturing industries, including bread and biscuits, large cakes and fried dough sticks, and sliced noodles. The wine industry and the pastry and snack industries will be temporarily suspended from allocation as they are considered luxury food industries. The allocation price of 70-pound foreign flour, according to the original negotiated price, is 100,570 yuan per bag for the factory price and 111,000 yuan per bag for the retail price, which will not change.

It is also learned that the central authorities, considering that citizens who consume edible flour in the city also account for a considerable percentage, are considering expanding the allocation of discounted flour to 500,000 small bags per month. In addition to allocating to various manufacturing industries, 50 discounted public sales shops will also be specially contracted to supply discounted flour for retail sales every day to benefit direct consumers.

[Another Report] Yesterday's flour market conditions were such that allocation of flour had not resumed, and factories were holding onto their goods, coupled with soaring rice prices, prices skyrocketed. Unified flour reached 93,000 yuan, military ship flour reached 145,000 yuan, large bags of wheat bran 81,000 yuan, small bags of wheat bran 54,000 yuan, all prices higher than last weekend.

### Money Tightens, Cloth Prices Fall

Yesterday, the yarn market experienced tight money, and distribution was not smooth, so it stopped after a slight increase. Only the dyeing and weaving factories on the street showed a slight interest in 42-count fine yarn, so the quoted price was able to stand firm. The trading price of 42-count yarn was 12.6 million yuan, a slight increase of 100,000 yuan compared to the previous day, but 20-count special double horse yarn fell by 50,000 yuan to 7.25 million yuan, and the prices of other counts of yarn showed mixed increases and decreases.

The cotton cloth market was stable at the beginning, but then due to tight money, actual sales were quiet. Many bulls in the market turned to selling, causing prices to fall. Twelve-pound Dragon Head fine cloth, because the spinning construction number was fully allocated on Saturday, with ample chips, the market trend was weak, and the final trading price was 300,000 yuan, a decrease of 10,000 yuan compared to last Saturday. Five Blessings 284,000 yuan, a small decrease of 11,000 yuan, the rest of the fine cloth and blue cloth fine twill drill bleached cloth and other types, fell more than they rose.

### Silk Market Stable

Yesterday's artificial silk 120 count Takayama bright, opened at 18 million yuan, traded 12 cases, and then rose. The highest reached 83 million yuan, and at the close it was quoted at 200,000 yuan. In the afternoon, because the Central Trust Bureau continued to allocate, people inevitably felt a little discouraged, and finally sold at 8.1 million yuan. As a result, it was still 100,000 yuan higher than the spot price traded on Saturday, and 200,000 yuan lower than the price traded for Monday on Saturday.

Yesterday the city's factory silk market was slightly emotional, opening at 21 million yuan for B grade, and the trading price for C grade was 20.05 million yuan, both 500,000 to 600,000 yuan higher than the quoted price on Saturday.

Dry warp still had no way out, and the other burden price hovered between 14.5 million and 5 million yuan.

Yesterday's silk goods market was quite stable, and the quoted prices for pure silk quilt covers in the market remained unchanged, but there were no transactions. Dachen checkered Biku opened at 31,500 yuan, and the highest was quoted at 600 to 700 yuan, but because there were more sellers than buyers, it weakened. The final price was 1,200 yuan. In the afternoon, because the price of silk was high, the quoted price was sold at 1,500 yuan, which was the same as last Saturday. Luo spun silk, because the producing area reported a high price, the price in Shanghai was increased by 500 yuan yesterday.

### Jewelry Shop Petition Representatives Return to Shanghai; Finance and Economy Departments Agree to Discuss Measures

The Shanghai Jewelry Industry Association elected representatives Wu Pengnian and four others to go to Beijing to petition in early last week, requesting the government to allow jewelry shops to freely buy and sell gold ornaments, and requesting the Central Bank to allocate bars, etc. After more than ten days, they returned to Shanghai yesterday. It is reported that the delegation to Beijing included dozens of representatives from Xinjiang, Jiangxi, Hunan, and Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, who petitioned the National Government Senate, the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Ministry of Finance, and other agencies, outlining the difficulties faced by the industry. The representatives also said that the government's crackdown on gold trading was intended to suppress prices, but it has been three months since the implementation, and prices are still soaring. The government's move has only made the lives of hundreds of thousands of jewelry workers across the country who depend on this for a living on the verge of ruin. As a result, the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economy agreed to submit the report to the National Government and decide on concrete improvement measures in the shortest possible time, so as not to disappoint the jewelry workers across the country. It is said that if the government still has no improvement measures in the short term, it will again go to Beijing to conduct a large-scale petition.

### High-Grade Bituminous Coal Continues to Rise; Jiaozuo White Coal Alone Weak

In the coal market, the supply of high-grade bituminous coal seams continues to be short, and the trend of rising prices is evident again. Especially Kai Ping No. 1 dross is the most popular, with prices already as high as 1,050,000 yuan. No. 2 dross and Keelung dross have a more moderate increase, and prices also require over 900,000 yuan. Bituminous coal lumps also slightly increased accordingly. Among low-grade bituminous coal dross, except for Poyle, which is more active, Fengcheng and others remain sluggish. Jiaozuo white coal previously interrupted arrivals, and the owners hoarded goods, the highest price reached more than 2 million yuan. Yesterday, due to a small amount of goods arriving from Hankou merchants, the market has been unable to support, and there are sellers at 1,900,000 yuan per ton.

### Cigarettes Return to Weakness in the Afternoon

Yesterday, the cigarette market trend was that with the universal increase of 30% in tobacco tax, the factory prices may have fluctuated, so the market opened strong. The industry in the field was actively pursuing, and the shipment of goods from other places also decreased, and the price was stable.

### Industrial Raw Materials Soar

Industrial raw materials, with the rise of all things, and the relaxation of silver circulation, purchases have started one after another, and the market is very tight. Caustic soda has rebounded again. Because liquid caustic soda and soda ash have risen sharply, the price is the same as solid, and the market is optimistic.

The Hankou tung oil market situation, yesterday afternoon, the city merchants received a phone call from Hankou, according to which it had risen to 475,000 yuan per dan, a crazy surge of 30% compared to 400,000 yuan last Friday. The reason is that the smuggling of tung oil in South China is more concrete and organized, so the gang is competing to purchase in the market. The afternoon price in this city was 540,000 yuan per zu, an increase of 20,000 yuan compared to the morning, and the market has become tight again.

### Export Sausage Casings Halt; Only Smugglers Can Profit

Sausage casings exports, the domestic cost is too high, the price of the foreign market has not improved, also in a state of stagnation. It is reported that the price in New York City, USA, is 2 jiao per pair, 2,500 pairs per barrel, converted to 6,000,000 national currency. The current price in the producing area is at least 2,800 yuan per pair of raw intestines, and about 7,000,000 per barrel. The processing fee is about 9,000,000 or more per barrel, so it is really impossible to export. The market price in Europe is 1 shilling and 6 pence per pair, about 8,000,000 national currency per barrel, although it is better than the US market, but there is no sales channel, and currently only smugglers can make huge profits.

### Women's Woolen Fabric Flat and Weak

All kinds of colorful light wool women's woolen fabrics, the market trend in recent days, are flat and weak, with few retail and wholesale transactions. Because the factory output is relatively sufficient, and the number of sizes stored is also large, the actual sales have reached the time of transition, and the selling price has risen a lot, and buyers are all holding a wait-and-see attitude. The market situation of men's woolen fabric, autumn flower tweed is very popular, and summer goods have risen to the saturation point. People's hearts are tired, and buyers want to promote the forward inventory, resulting in continued reduction in wholesale, and the market atmosphere may decline.

### Dutch India and Singapore Restrict Overseas Chinese Remittances

The issue of overseas Chinese remittances, smuggling, and export foreign exchange evasion has attracted close attention from various authorities. The Ministry of Finance has now implemented three measures to strengthen overseas Chinese remittance institutions, simplify overseas Chinese remittance procedures, and relax overseas Chinese remittance standards, in order to increase overseas Chinese remittances and export foreign exchange holdings. According to financial circles, some local authorities in Nanyang often restrict or hinder overseas Chinese merchants from remitting money to China. For example, the Dutch Indian government restricts each person from remitting no more than 300 guilders, and Singapore restricts 85 Malaysian dollars per month. The government authorities are paying close attention to this situation and are negotiating with the respective countries.

### Balancing International Payments; Preparing to Revise Tariff

Since the implementation of the import licensing system, the import surplus has gradually decreased. In order to balance international payments, the authorities will use strict tariffs. The Ministry of Finance has started research, and import and export taxes will be revised. The principles are: (1) Industrial machinery that cannot be manufactured domestically will be exempted from import duties. (2) For industrial finished products processed domestically and sold abroad, the imported raw materials or semi-finished products will be refunded appropriately. (3) For daily necessities that are insufficient in domestic supply, a lighter import tax will be levied. (4) Imported goods that compete with domestic industries will be subject to heavy taxes. (5) Luxury goods will be prohibited through taxation and will still be subject to heavy taxes. On the export side, tax exemption or reduction will be used to encourage exports.

### This Year's Chinese Tea Sales to the UK Significantly Reduced in the First Quarter

According to a spokesperson for the Farmers Bank of China: After the implementation of the tea loan program, Hunan and Fujian provinces have purchased raw tea according to the bank's regulations and are actively engaged in production. Qimen black tea merchants are also successively purchasing raw tea. The bank has lent 1.8 billion yuan in these three places. As for the tea merchants in Tunxi, they have not yet started production. They still hope that the government can lend huge amounts of loans and then purchase raw tea, and they are unwilling to advance their own capital for purchase. The Farmers Bank of China has repeatedly stated that the country cannot lend large amounts due to the overall economic relationship, and hopes that tea merchants can take into account the country's difficulties and strengthen tea production. Qimen is a major tea producing area in China, and the government has high expectations for this producing area this year. The Farmers Bank of China will purchase tea produced in various places, boxed and transported to Shanghai at a price of 600,000 per box, and then sell it abroad. It will strengthen the export of tea produced this year. According to statistics from relevant parties, the amount of tea shipped to the UK this year has been significantly reduced compared to before. In the first quarter of the year before the Anti-Japanese War, from January to March, 1,663 boxes of tea were shipped to the UK, while only 283 boxes were shipped to the UK in the first quarter of this year, from January to March. The difference is huge. Other countries have also decreased compared to before. If the government and the people do not cooperate and work hard together, the future of tea exports this year is in jeopardy.

### Evaluating Old Tea Pledged First

The Shanghai Tea Export Industry Association members, with about 100,000 boxes of red and green export box tea pledged to the China Farmers Bank last year, totaling 60,000 dan. In order to clarify its actual export value before requesting the government to purchase, a meeting was held to decide to first invite representatives from the foreign tea export companies Jardine Matheson, Xiehe, and Yongxing in this city, as well as well-known tea experts Li Weiqing, Zhuo Xibo, and Lu Jiamao, to first assess the grade and evaluate the value, sign their opinions, and then submit them to the authorities to provide a basis. It is learned that the above six representatives went to the China Tea Joint Company on Fuxu Road at 10:30 am yesterday to first determine the preliminary standard qualifications for all tea samples, and will start the evaluation work separately from today. It is expected that it will take two weeks to complete.

### Fir Wood Firm and Stable

Fir wood prices are quite stable in the Shanghai market because water freight has increased, and it is rumored that wages for loading ships in the producing areas have increased too much, and the Fujian Zhuang has a unanimous suspension of loading news.

### Wine Market Soars

Recently, Shaoxing wine and Su wine have risen by 50%, and the potential trend is quite strong. Baijiu has risen even more sharply, increasing by 150% compared to the previous month.

### Tea Spring Season in Western Anhui

— Hefei, 12th Rapid Dispatch, Our reporter Bao Baiping

This reporter's tour of western Anhui is during the most beautiful tea season. West of Lu'an, the spring mountains are smiling, and the hills and fields are covered with tea gardens. In towns, villages, and mountains, everyone is busy with tea, talking about tea, buying and selling tea, and carrying tea by shoulder and car. The quality of the tea spring in a year has a great impact on the entire rural economy of western Anhui.

Lu'an, Lihuang, Yuexi, Huoshan, and Shucheng are all tea-producing areas in western Anhui. Entering the tea area, there are layers of mountain peaks. It is said that the higher the mountain, the more it is covered by clouds and fog, and the more fertile the black sand soil, the higher the quality of the tea produced, including its color, aroma, and taste. Like the Lu'an Qitou Mountain Guapian, it has almost become a treasure in "Lu'an Tea." This can also be seen in tea books. The Lu'an Zhou Zhi records Huang Xiao's "Crystal Nunnery Record," which once said, "Crystal Nunnery is located at the foot of Qitou Mountain, with overlapping peaks and heavy shadows, and the sound of the stream is like a roar. The top of the mountain is twenty li high, producing cloud and mist tea, a unique product of Lu." Qitou Mountain is located fifteen li southeast of Mabao. When the reporter was in Mabao, I heard that the current Qitou Mountain tea, the best tea is only a few plants, which is authentic cloud and mist tea. Early this year, several people with guns were waiting on it to pick tea. Cloud and mist tea is indeed beyond praise and is already worth ten times its value.

The tea-producing areas are divided into "outer mountain," "inner mountain," "east mountain," and "west mountain." The so-called "outer mountain" is low mountain, yellow mud soil, and the quality of tea is poor; "inner mountain" is high mountain, black sand soil, and the quality of tea is better. For example, Dahua Ping, Zhufo Temple, and Gantang of Huoshan, and Mabao, Liubo 　, and Gubeichong of Lihuang are called "inner mountain areas"; Dongliu River, Qingtang Gou, and Luoyang River of Huoshan, and Chuanbanchong, Balitan, and Gongdian of Lihuang are called "outer mountain areas." As for "east mountain" and "west mountain," they are divided according to the terrain. East of the Pi River in Huoshan is called "east mountain," and west is called "west mountain." In terms of tea quality, "east mountain" is not as good as "west mountain."

Cloudy winter, dry spring, low yield

Relying on the mountain to eat the mountain, common crops are difficult to grow in mountainous areas, so farmers mostly rely on tea harvests to exchange for food and cloth to maintain their lives.

Before the 20th year of the Republic of China, the output of tea in western Anhui was the most, with an annual output of one million baskets (ten jin per basket). Unfortunately, in the 20th year of the Republic of China, the tea production centers of Huoshan and Lihuang counties were occupied by the Communist army, and the production and sales of tea were disconnected. Many inner mountain tea gardens were barren. After the Communist army was defeated and retreated in the 24th year, it had not yet recovered, and in the 26th year, the War of Resistance broke out, and the tea area was blockaded by the Japanese army. As a result, production and sales stagnated, and mountain prices were extremely low. The income of tea farmers was not enough to cover the cost. As a result, tea gardens encountered misfortune. Tea farmers gave up the management of tea gardens, and some removed tea trees and planted miscellaneous grains. According to a survey by the Huoshan Tea Improvement Farm in the 31st year, the total output of tea in western Anhui was only 406,000 baskets, which was more than half less than before the 20th year of the Republic of China. Who should the tea farmers ask for this tragic loss?

Lu'an produces the most tea, followed by Huoshan, then Lihuang, and Yuexi and Shucheng the least. The statistics of the Huoshan Tea Improvement Farm in the 27th and 31st years are listed in the table below:

(27th year)

Lu'an　237,000 baskets

Huoshan　200,000 baskets

Lihuang　102,000 baskets

Shucheng　100,000 baskets

Yuexi　17,000 baskets

(31st year)

Lu'an　160,009 baskets

Huoshan　136,600 baskets

Lihuang　120,100 baskets

Shucheng　20,600 baskets

Yuexi　12,000 baskets

After the victory, the production of tea in western Anhui did not increase. Although there are no figures for this year's output, a tea farmer told the reporter that the tea mountain cannot be frozen in winter, and rain is indispensable in spring. Last winter was colder than the previous year, and this spring rain was less than last year, so tea production will definitely not be more than last year. In this way, even if the output is the same as last year, it will only be 400,000 to 500,000 baskets. How to revitalize the tea gardens in western Anhui, and how to increase the production of tea in western Anhui, the reporter believes that this is a major issue in the rural economy of western Anhui. We cannot regard it as a sideline of farmers and ignore it. Assuming that the tea output this year is 500,000 baskets, according to the tea price in Mabao, 12,000 yuan per jin, the total value is 600 million yuan, which is of considerable value to the 600,000 tea farmers in western Anhui.

Lively Department Morning of Tea House Picking Tea Leaves

Walking the streets of Dushan and Mabao, the reporter saw a tea house every few houses. The equipment of the tea house includes not only relatively beautiful houses, but also many tables and stools for picking tea, large and small tea baskets for baking tea, earthen beds, and weighing sheds.

Tea farmers or tea vendors send tea leaves to the tea house. In addition to the buying and selling procedures, the tea making process is: (1) picking tea grass. (2) Stir-frying into tidal tea. (3) Drying into dry tea. (Called drawing fire, one handover fire, two handover fire, drawing old fire) (4) Picking tea (removing old leaves and old stalks). (5) Loading into baskets (the baskets are woven from bamboo, lined with leaf raising and round bamboo leaves, and each basket can hold exactly ten jin of net tea.)

Picking tea is the liveliest department in the tea house. In the early morning, when the sun is just visible, women always account for the absolute majority, old and young, all gathering at the tea house.

The table is full of dry tea, and they pick out the old leaves and old stalks and put them in a bowl, and the picked dry tea is put into the tea basket leaning against the table.

They sit on the bench for a day, and the wages they earn are only two or three thousand yuan, and they have to go back to their own houses to eat. This kind of labor sale is the cheapest.

Transportation Blocked Domestic Sales Difficult Tea Farmers Suffer

According to people familiar with the tea situation, tea in western Anhui has always been sold domestically, and it has been transported to North China and even outside the Guan since the Ming Dynasty. At the end of the Qing Dynasty, the "Mist Eyebrow Tip" of Huoshan was once offered to the emperor. In the early years of the Republic of China, it was not only sold to North China, but also to Jiangsu and Zhejiang, but because the tea making and basket loading methods in western Anhui adhered to the old methods and did not know how to improve, the original Jiangsu and Zhejiang markets were replaced by Zhejiang tea. In the past 30 years, in addition to sales in this province, most of them have been transported to Shandong, and the farthest reaches Tianjin.

Before the war, the tea from Lu'an was transported by water from the Pi River to Bengbu and transferred to the Jinpu Road north to Shandong, and the freight was 8 jiao per basket. The tea from Lihuang was concentrated at Zhengyangguan by both land and water, and transferred to Shandong via Bengbu, and the freight was 1 yuan and 5 jiao per basket. The tea from Huoshan was also transported to Bengbu by the Pi River and transferred to the Jinpu Road, and the freight was also 1 yuan and 5 jiao per basket. The tea from Yuexi was transported from Huoshan Shiqi to 　, and transported to Shandong via Bengbu via Zhengyangguan, and the freight was 1 yuan and 7 jiao per basket. The tea from Shucheng was transported from Sankou River to Pukou to Shandong, and the freight was 8 jiao per basket.

During the War of Resistance, the Jinpu Road was cut off, and tea transportation was stagnant for a long time. Until the 29th year, it was transported from Lu'an, Zhengyang, Fuyang, Yuanqiangji, Boxian, Guide to Jinan. This road was very difficult to transport, but because of the benefits, tea merchants did not hesitate to take risks, and it is said that the profit at that time was more than doubled.

Today, transportation is even more difficult. The Communist army's best trick is to destroy transportation. The two roads before and during the war are not open, and tea in western Anhui has no way to sell even domestically!

Today, there are very few Shandong tea merchants who come to western Anhui, so tea prices have fallen. During the tea spring last year, tea farmers could spend 3,000 yuan for one jin of tea and exchange it for two dou of rice. At this time this year, although the tea price is as high as 10,000 yuan or more, it cannot be exchanged for one dou of rice. This makes the lives of tea farmers even lower. For the lives of tea farmers, for opening up the sales of tea in western Anhui, and for restoring domestic transportation, the reporter hopes that the entire Jinpu Road can be fully opened as soon as possible!

### Hong Kong Foreign Company Circles Abolish the Comprador System

— Hong Kong, 10th Air Mail, Our Special Correspondent Zi Jian

Most of the major foreign companies and banks in Hong Kong have abolished the deep-rooted comprador system that has existed for decades. Among the foreign companies, such as Taikoo, Fatten, and Tiensheng, and among the banks, such as HSBC, Standard Chartered, Bank of America, and Baotong, have all abolished the comprador system one after another. The personnel in the comprador's office under the original comprador system are no longer independent and have been changed to employees of foreign companies or banks. The comprador himself has been renamed manager or senior staff. This cannot but be said to be a major revolution in Hong Kong's ten-mile foreign concession!

Hong Kong's environment is like a kaleidoscope. We must look at it from many angles and cannot take one side and generalize the rest. Han Puson, the director of the United Press in China, after coming to Hong Kong from Shanghai, said to people: Going from Shanghai to Hong Kong is like "being released from prison after serving a term." This sentence is not surprising. What is surprising is that Han Qingsen himself "was released" for a few days and then voluntarily returned to "prison"! Hong Kong does not need boring eulogies, nor does it need malicious criticism, but it needs a true understanding, which will benefit both China and the UK.

### Taiwan's Newspapers and Paper: Taking Another Step Forward

— Taipei, 7th (Airmail) — Our Correspondent in Taiwan, Yang Yu

The violent storm of the February 28th Incident has fiercely swept across, and the journalistic circles of Taiwan Province have suffered unprecedented misfortune, with many newspapers ceasing publication. Other newspapers, under the impact of the incident, also appeared exhausted, lacking money and paper, unable to sustain themselves any longer. Consequently, some halted publication, others closed down, and the once-thriving newspaper industry was reduced to only the China Daily News and the Shin Sheng Daily News. Although the newspaper scene in Taiwan Province now seems to be stirring from stillness, one instinctively knows that the difficulty lies in a single word: paper. Solving the paper issue solves everything.

Rare Machinery and Equipment in the Far East

What is the situation of paper production and distribution in this province? Dr. Xie Hui, General Manager of the Taiwan Paper Corporation, gave the following answer to the reporter:

Taiwan's paper industry previously had over twenty large and small paper mills. In terms of scale, productivity, and machinery and equipment, it was an industry of significant standing in East Asia, with an annual paper production of over 100,000 tons. Japan, having Taiwan, truly benefited greatly from a cultural perspective alone. After the Retrocession, these twenty-odd units were divided into private, provincial, and jointly-operated by the national and provincial governments, according to the nature of the factories. The largest in scale was the jointly-operated by the national and provincial governments, under the Taiwan Paper Corporation, with a total of five factories.

The Taipei Factory, located in Luodong, was formerly the Taiwan Industrial Co., Ltd. It has modern equipment, including two 120-inch wide paper machines and three cooking pots resembling seven-story buildings, capable of holding fifteen tons of raw materials. These are mostly rare machines in the East Asian papermaking industry. It suffered significant damage during the war. After the takeover, all efforts were spent on repairing the machinery and factory buildings. Now, eighty or ninety percent of the repairs have been completed, with over 4,000 tons of cement used for the cement works alone. The factory primarily produces printing paper, as well as Taiwan Bond paper, banknote paper, cigarette paper, etc. The output in March reached 285 metric tons. The most critical tools for the paper mill, such as copper wire mesh and felt, were nearing depletion. Fortunately, a batch of American goods has recently been purchased. With these reinforcements, the Taipei Paper Factory is likely to achieve its target of 50 tons of daily output.

Converting Pulp Machines to Produce Taiwan Bond Paper

The Shilin Branch of the Taipei Factory, formerly the Taitung Paper Manufacturing Co., Ltd., specializes in producing various hardboards, such as roofing boards, white cardboard, yellow cardboard, and train tickets. There is no shortage of raw material, rice straw, and the monthly output is around 400 tons, exceeding the Japanese era. Sales are excellent, so although the factory is small, it greatly helps the company's finances.

The Taiwan Pulp Industrial Co., Ltd., now renamed the Taichung Paper Factory, previously produced only bagasse pulp, with a daily output of 50 tons. However, bagasse is currently difficult to obtain, and suspending operations would waste the efficiency of the machinery. Therefore, the pulp machine was converted into an 82-inch wide paper machine, using bamboo, citronella, daylilies, and other materials to produce cement company paper bags, the Tobacco Monopoly Bureau's cigarette cartons, and 50-pound Taiwan Bond paper. Although only 150 tons of paper were produced in March, it still manages to increase revenue for the company.

The Kaohsiung Factory, formerly known as the East Asia Paper Industrial Co., Ltd., suffered the most damage from bombing. The factory was completed at the end of 1944, producing about 10 tons of kraft paper and cement bags per day. However, it remained idle after the takeover until recently, when it was repaired to some extent. The test run last month was successful, and it is scheduled to officially start operations on the 10th of this month, but the output will be about 70% of what it was before.

A Misstep by the Taipei Paper Factory

Among the five factories, the Tainan Factory is the most promising. During the era of the Yanshui Port Pulp Industrial Co., Ltd., it produced nearly 100 tons of bagasse pulp per day. It is a grand scale and could be said to be China's largest pulp factory, with internal equipment comparable to that of the United States. Due to insufficient funds, repairs to the damaged factory buildings and machinery only began at the end of last year. The test run was conducted simultaneously with the Kaohsiung Factory on the 25th of last month, and the results were satisfactory. It is now scheduled to start operations on May 15th, using the bagasse stockpiled from three years ago as raw material, with an estimated daily output of 30 tons of pulp.

General Manager Xie told the reporter that the factory bases of all Taiwan's paper mills are mostly unsuitable. In terms of transportation, raw material supply, and proximity to the market, they are not the most modern and scientific locations. However, he also pointed out the reasons for this. For example, the Taipei Paper Factory was built in remote Luodong because the Japanese initially planned to use daylilies from the mountains near the factory site as raw material for papermaking. The quality was excellent, but unfortunately, the Japanese realized that this grass could only be harvested once every two years, which they considered too late. Finally, the Governor-General's Office allocated the Lintianshan Management Office of Hualien Port to supply raw materials, which helped them overcome the difficulty.

Preliminary Hopes for Export are Limitless

Buying copper mesh finally solved the most troublesome problem for the paper mills, but the raw material issue has become a new challenge. Although Taiwan has a lot of timber, most of it is construction timber. To date, there is no continuous supply of timber for making paper. As a second option, if bamboo and bagasse can be supplied in large quantities, the threat to raw materials seems unlikely for the time being.

The company's products were previously sold entirely within the province, and newsprint was entirely distributed through the Public Office's Paper Allocation Committee. However, only Taiwan Bookstore's textbook printing department and the China Daily News and Shin Sheng Daily News were eligible for this right. Currently, the allocation price for roll paper is NT$48 per pound, with an 80% discount, which is much lower than the black market price in Shanghai. However, the rationing system cannot be abolished until the increase in production can meet demand. Recently, the paper company has begun to export 100 tons of Taiwan Bond paper to Shanghai on a trial basis. This is the first export of Taiwan-produced paper. We hope that it will receive a good response and further hope that in cooperation with cultural undertakings, the paper company will make its greatest effort to enable the cultural undertakings of this province to take another step forward on a high level!

Weekly Forum

### On China's Insurance Industry in the Current Stage

— Wu Tongyuan

Recently, fires have occurred frequently in our city. In addition to actively improving fire prevention equipment, we should also proactively purchase insurance from insurance companies to protect our lives and property. Therefore, a review of the current insurance industry at this time and place may also have its value.

The meaning of insurance lies in dispersing the additional losses suffered by individuals or groups due to unavoidable or possible disasters. These additional losses are jointly borne by individuals or groups participating in insurance. The current method is to use the insurance industry as an intermediary, whereby each insured person pays a certain amount of insurance premium on time, and receives a certain amount of compensation when a disaster occurs, so that they will not suffer unexpected blows that prevent them from carrying out normal work. Therefore, insurance companies can not only protect individuals or groups from unexpected blows in a negative way, but also actively gather the strength of the public to try to improve the environment and gradually reduce the possibility of disasters. Therefore, it is not only a profitable business, but also has the function of serving the people and stabilizing social order. In recent years, many countries have used various insurances as the main social policy and enforced them by law, which shows the importance of the insurance business. Although China's insurance business has initially taken shape, it has not yet been recognized by all sectors of society. Therefore, it is necessary to conduct a theoretical or practical review of the insurance business to enable the insurance industry to serve people from all walks of life in accordance with the current economic situation.

Let us first discuss compensation. Compensation is a kind of compensation that the insured person obtains from the insurer for the material losses suffered due to the occurrence of a disaster. In principle, this compensation should be able to compensate for all the material damage suffered by the insured person. However, according to current laws, the calculation of compensation is based on the amount insured at the time of insurance. As a result, in times of volatile prices, the loss of currency depreciation is entirely borne by the insured person, which is not only unfair but also violates the original intention of insurance! Take fire insurance as an example: Assuming that according to statistics over the years, the average number of fires in first-class buildings of warehouses storing non-dangerous goods is four per thousand per year. Therefore, the insurance association stipulated at that time that the insurance rate for this type of warehouse was five per thousand, so that the insurance premium income would have appropriate business income after deducting compensation. Now suppose there are 10 million bags of flour, each worth 10,000 yuan, stored on average in 1,000 first-class buildings of warehouses. At that time, each warehouse insured 100 million yuan of flour fire insurance, and paid a total of 500 million yuan in insurance premiums, that is, a one-time advance payment of 50,000 bags of flour, of which 10,000 bags were the insurer's handling fee, and 40,000 bags were used for compensation. Assuming that during this year, prices have doubled and the price of flour has risen from 10,000 yuan per bag to 20,000 yuan. During this period, the insured suffered the destruction of 40,000 bags of flour due to a fire in four warehouses. As a result, because the insured amount was only 400 million yuan, the compensation received could only buy back 20,000 bags of flour, and 20,000 bags of flour were sacrificed invisibly. On the contrary, after the insurer obtained 50,000 bags of insurance premiums, the value of investment operations remained unchanged. After deducting 10,000 bags of flour for expenses and surplus, the remaining 40,000 bags of flour were used for compensation. As a result, due to currency changes, only 20,000 bags of flour needed to be compensated, resulting in an unexpected surplus of 20,000 bags of flour. Assuming that the more the currency depreciates, the greater the loss of the insured person and the more the insurer gains without labor, it is said that during the period of price changes, the insured person can increase the value at any time and go through the procedures for additional insurance, but in fact the insured person has already prepaid one year of insurance premium, and this additional insurance premium is the loss when the currency depreciates. Even with life insurance, whether it is life insurance for death or survival annuity, its nature is similar to a fixed deposit. Not only is the total value of the life insurance money far less than the life insurance premium paid on time, but also the original intention of insurance is completely lost, because the meager life insurance money is not enough to enjoy the old age when alive, and not enough to pay for the dead when dead. In this way, it is no different from climbing a tree to catch fish if you want to develop the life insurance business. Therefore, compensation is the main focus of the current insurance industry, and whether its measures are appropriate can affect the fate of the insurance industry. In recent years, the index life insurance held by the China Trust Life Insurance Office is used to correct this drawback, but it is only limited to the life insurance end. According to the same method, property insurance should also follow the example of index life insurance and take the principle of compensating for physical objects, otherwise the amount of compensation should also be calculated based on the replacement value. However, whether the insurer has the ability to bear the physical compensation is also worthy of our consideration. For example, the price of the insured property increases more than the price index, or the surplus obtained from narrow investment outlets is not enough to offset the depreciation of the currency, resulting in only a little more than 40,000 bags of insurance premiums for 50,000 bags of flour. After deducting 40,000 bags of physical compensation, the remainder is not enough for business expenses. Naturally, it is also not acceptable to the insurance industry. However, according to the current method, the loss of the entire currency depreciation is borne by the insured person, which is also unfair. A compromise can be to adopt the method of paying insurance premiums in installments, so as to reduce the loss of the insured person without causing the insurer to have the suspicion of gaining without labor. The method is that the insurance premium for a one-year policy can be paid in four installments. If the currency fluctuates greatly, it can be paid in twelve installments. If the insured person is willing to pay in one lump sum, it can be converted into several discounts based on the market interest rate according to the present value method of annuity. If compensation occurs midway, the unpaid insurance premium can be deducted from the compensation money. This method can take care of both parties and can be used as a reference for the insurance authorities.

Secondly, in terms of insurance premium rates, the formulation of insurance premium rates is similar in nature to the pricing of goods by ordinary industrial and commercial enterprises. Reasonable and correct premium rates can enable the insured to pay the lowest insurance premium and the insurer can obtain considerable business profits. Otherwise, too high or too low will affect the promotion of legitimate business. Theoretically, the insurance premium rate should be based on the probability of various disasters, plus business expenses and surplus factors. Therefore, the insurance premium rate should be based on various statistical data in order to seek its accuracy, such as life insurance based on the mortality rate of various ages in a certain city, etc. However, this premium rate is not immutable. For example, due to new achievements in science, or improvements in various environments, the occurrence of harm can be reduced. For example, after continuous research and improvement by scientists, BCG can be widely used in medicine, resulting in a large reduction in tuberculosis patients, so as to reduce the population mortality rate in large cities. In this way, the life insurance premium should also be reduced accordingly. Its nature is similar to that of a factory that greatly increases production and reduces costs due to the implementation of scientific management, which reduces the selling price. However, this kind of data still needs to be based on daily statistics. Therefore, if you want to improve the insurance business, you must carry out various statistical work to obtain scientific basis. Theoretically speaking, the longer the age of the statistical figures or the more data collected, the smaller the probable error and the more correct the conclusion. However, during the period of price fluctuations, this kind of statistical work is difficult to carry out, because the currency value of each period is different, and the correctness of calculating the absolute numbers of different currency values side by side is doubtful, especially during the period when the currency value is accelerating. The weight of the later stage is very large. In other words, this conclusion is entirely based on the figures of the last few months, and the large error is self-evident. This drawback is not irreparable. We can eliminate the factors of currency depreciation based on the price index. Of course, this cumbersome work is not something that a few insurance companies can handle, but we can gather the strength of the industry to help this effort, so that the insurance business can cooperate with the social and economic environment of each era to strengthen the foundation of the insurance business!

During the period of price fluctuations, the insurance industry has its own unique advantages. Assuming that the business remains unchanged, the income of the insurance industry can follow the price index at any time, because the insurance premium is proportional to the insured amount, and the insured amount rises and falls according to the price index at any time, so the insurance premium income is also proportional to the price index, and does not need to adjust its selling price at any time due to the depreciation of the currency as other industries do. Therefore, how to strive for improvement during this period to lay the foundation for the insurance industry is the most important task for the insurance industry.

### Joint Appeal from Tenants in Tangqi

Dear Editor, The rent of houses in Tangqi Town has always been higher than in nearby areas. The reason for this is that most of the houses in the town are owned by a few large households, who arbitrarily manipulate the market. After the victory, the landlords discriminated against the legal tender and created the practice of paying rent in rice. Merchants were eager to make a living and initially endured the practice, but due to the impact of economic turbulence, the market plummeted, while rents increased year after year. Recently, rice prices have soared, and the daily business income of shops is not enough to pay the rent. All the merchants in the town have no means of livelihood, the number of unemployed people is increasing, and the society is in a state of unrest. Therefore, the merchants in the town were forced to save themselves and united to organize a Tenants' Association. The requirements are nothing more than (1) abolishing the evil practice of converting rent prices with rice (2) middlemen should not fuel the flames, and a notarization system should be implemented (3) following the Gregorian calendar, and abolishing the old practice of calculating rent with the lunar calendar, (4) reducing the deposit (5) the landlord should bear the cost of house repairs and taxes that the landlord should be responsible for, and should not force the tenants to bear them (6) the landlord should not arbitrarily terminate the lease by pretext of self-use if the tenant does not owe rent, etc. In addition to requesting the competent authorities to approve the filing of this organization, we also ask the county government to issue the Hangzhou County Store Renting Regulations to obtain a reasonable rental relationship. We hope that your newspaper will grant a small space for disclosure and seek the sympathy of all sectors. (Li Ahe)

### Reply Regarding Transportation Suggestions

This newspaper forwarded reader Mr. Li Zuoyuan's letter suggesting improvement of traffic in this city to the Public Transportation Company of this city for verification. We now received a reply from the Transportation Company stating: "We have read Mr. Li's suggestions, and we deeply appreciate his profound insights and unique perspectives. In addition to sincerely adopting them and expressing our gratitude, we also have the following two statements: (1) The reason why the No. 9 and No. 7 buses do not extend into the central district is that there is no wide parking location in the central district, which prevents vehicles from turning around. Currently, the No. 3, No. 4, and No. 10 routes on the Bund of Beijing Road and the Bund of Nanjing Road all have stations, and it is also planned to set up a large-scale bus terminal on the Bund (including the No. 9 and No. 7 routes), which is being submitted to the Municipal Transportation Conference for approval. In addition, the No. 7 route has recently decided to expand from the Wusong Road intersection to the Bund of East Zhongzheng Road first, and connect with the lines in the central district, which will be implemented soon. (2) The reason why the driving time of drivers must be rigidly stipulated is that it is easy to cause disorder if the driving time is not stipulated. If drivers are allowed to adjust themselves, it is inevitable that there will be problems of speeding or slowing down. As for the driver arriving at the terminal, if there is time to spare, he can get off the bus to check the parts. The section of 6 or 7 vehicles gathering at the terminal that you mentioned is a temporary extra bus that is specially used to solve passenger congestion during daily office hours. There will not be this phenomenon at other times." This is recorded.

### Please Change the Time to Clear Garbage

Outside my front door and front window, every night after 9 o'clock, a large amount of garbage is piled up by vehicles from the Baxianfang alley, and the stench is straight up, which greatly threatens hygiene and safety. I would like to ask the authorities to order the garbage trucks from that place to extend the time to after most people have gone to bed, and the large garbage trucks that carry them to the next morning should be brought forward, and I hope that the address where the garbage is piled will be set up far away from the windows, so as not to hinder the hygiene of the people in the alley and my family. (Ding Tunan)

### Unfair Distribution of Labor Services

Dear Editor, It has been found that civil servants were allocated five zhang of bleached cloth and one zhang and five chi of khaki per person this month, while laborers were allocated only one zhang and five chi of bleached cloth per person. Laborers also have parents, families, and wives, so why are they only allocated so little? It seems unfair in terms of emotion and reason. The bleached cloth allocated to laborers is not suitable or economical, because most laborers do manual work and are very easily soiled. They need to use more soap every day to wash them. It is better to use khaki cloth. I hope that your newspaper will grant a small space for the authorities to allocate more khaki cloth and hope to improve the quantity. (A Laborer from Shanghai)

### My Last Thought

— By Filipe P. Rizal, Translated by Gao Lang

Farewell, my beloved land; Land beloved by the sun; Pearl of the Eastern Sea; Our lost Eden! With joy I give you my sad life, Which was once so bright, so happy, and so strong, For your sake, I am willing to dedicate my life to you.

Without hesitation, without regret, Men fight madly on the battlefield, Dedicating their lives to you, but what is around them! Are they pine trees, laurel trees, or water lilies, Guillotines or vast nations, Resistance or cruel martyrdom, Anyway, it's all the same, It was to save the country and family.

When I die, From the day of the Advent of Jesus shrouded in black, Watch the declaration of the flying sky. It is in need of purple to color its dawn, Here is my blood; I happily shed it for it, As long as it can be plated with the light of rebirth.

My fantasy is just a child, At that time, it was a vibrant youth, Forever looking at you, Jewel of the Eastern Sea, Your black eyes are dry, You raised your happy face, And your pure and flawless glory.

My life's fantasy! My fervent worry! Calling to my departing soul, Oh, cheers! For the sake of dedicating to your future This is a glorious death; For the sake of dedicating your life to die; To die under your sky; To lie permanently in your loving embrace.

How many days later, you will find on my grave A lonely and humble flower, Touch it between the dense leaves, Put it on your lips, Kissing my soul. Let me feel my forehead Under the cool tombstone and your warm and cordial breath.

Let the gentle and quiet moonlight watch over me; Let the dawn unfold its brilliant splendor; Let the wind wail its solemn lament. Let the birds fly down to rest on my cross, Let it announce a song of peace on it.

Let the scorching sun melt the dew, Radiating from the blank space of the notes of my song. Let friendly people grieve my premature death, Praying in the tranquil twilight, Oh, dear country! You must also pray to God for me.

Pray for all those nameless victims; For the unequal suffering they endured; For our sad and impoverished mothers; For widows and orphans; For the tortured criminals; Also pray for yourself to possibly obtain final redemption.

When the shadows of night cover the cemetery, Look at those lonely dead left behind, Do not disturb their rest, Nor disturb their mystery. You must listen to a kind of string sound, This is me, beloved country, I sing for you.

When my grave is completely forgotten, There is no sign of the cross and the stele, Let the farmer sow on its mound; And my ashes will become the dust of your land before they are completely burned.

After that, if you abandon me, Forget me, I don't mind. I will pass through your air, gaps, and valleys. I will ring in your eardrum, A clear sound; Fragrant, color, language, song, A sigh, eternally repeating my faithful elements.

My worshipful country, My sorrowful sorrow! My beloved Filipinos! Listen to my most repeated farewell. I leave all of them and you; My fathers and lovers. The place I am going to has no slaves, no tyrants, no executioners; There is faith not death; There is the place where God reigns.

Farewell, fathers, brothers, I drew a line with the water of life! Childhood friends who lost their homes, Thank you, I am going to rest from that tiring day. Farewell, friendly strangers, my friends, my joy, Farewell, the people I love. Death is rest.

Note: Jose Rizal was the great national hero of the Philippines, physicist, scientist, economist, novelist, and poet. On December 30, 1896, he was executed by the Spanish authorities in Manila. And his death also triggered the Philippines to begin resisting Spain. This poem was written a few hours before he was executed.

### The Low Tide of Aoyuan

— Zhao Jingshen

Although paper is scarce in Vienna, various periodicals are still published. The publications with various covers make people not know what to buy. Music, drama, literature, politics, fashion, all kinds of publications are countless. Although Austria's film industry has only produced one film after the war, about ten film publications have been published.

Newspapers serialize long novels, and writers try their best to avoid words such as "war," "fascism," and "politics." They would rather take Johann Strauss's comfortable days and "pleasant old Vienna" as the background. The long serials published in each issue of the weekly "Storyteller" always have a murder or adultery. Low-level unconsciousness, which is the characteristic of Viennese novels, is called "fried chicken literature" (Brathuhn-iterature) by democratic people, because it appeals to the stomach, not to the heart or the brain.

Recently, fascists prevented the growth of Viennese students, and Austrian democrats plastered the city with propaganda slogans. On the wall was a Hitler-like soldier—a young man with only empty eye sockets of a corpse. It said: "Mothers, fight against those who want your children to learn to be like them."

This is a propaganda painting against fascism. Now, of course, they are hiding, but their oppressed and extinct influence still exists in Austrian life, and their shadows also sweep over literature.

The Vienna court is now trying the fascist writer Jeluslc. Sitting below is a blank face. In the past, Jeluslc was a strong supporter of the "Anschluss" and a radical propagandist. His novels add love to history, and Caesar is written to resemble Hitler.

Undoubtedly, this person corrupted the souls of young people and is also a national shame, but the judge wants to reinstate this filthy guest. A Viennese professor said to his students: "Unfortunately, Jeluslc's works cannot be republished now, but one day history will judge who is right in this dispute."

Austrian fascists cannot openly promote their ideas now. But they always try their best to pull back the Austrian people who are going along the road of democracy.

This is a disabled century. Nine out of ten children do not know Tolstoy, Jack London, or Romain Rolland, or even Moyne Reid or Fenimore Cooper. All works from democratic countries are prohibited. Children's literature from Dickens to Mark Twain has been replaced by Karl May's endless novels, who is a colonialist.

The book market is full of fried chicken literature, which means more than just business. People cannot openly publish Nazi literature now, so they have to publish mystery stories and crime stories. They hope that this kind of spiritual food can prevent dangerous thoughts. They are interested in ordinary crimes and no longer bother with the crimes of the Hitlerites.

A large number of American crime films also poured in. The French autumn salon of 1940 brought Vienna still Picasso, Matisse and those old people. Among them was a faint French resistance to German bloody tears. Besides being packed in wooden frames, nothing can be seen. The paintings seem to be painted casually at any time.

A female student at the University of Vienna wanted to study Zola, but was also prohibited. It is said that Zola was a supporter of the Dreyfus affair, and his opposition to the pastor was excessive. Many famous works, such as Shakespeare, Tolstoy, Goethe, Heine, Schiller, and Gogol's works, were published by a bookstore in a set of "Eternal Language" (Evige Wort), and such books were also prohibited.

There are also quite thoughtful writers in Austria, but there are too few such writers. Let's take two people as examples below:

Frank Tsokor recently wrote a dramatic poem called Calypso. During the Hitler era, he moved to Dalmatia. He used the ancient mythology of Odyssey to express his thoughts and illustrate the poet's responsibility to the country. This is a sincere work, and the idea is of the times. But few people pay attention, and only the intellectual class is slightly affected. His neglect is a common phenomenon in modern Austria. In the era of fascist rule, only culture builders who destroy genius exist. The merchants who sell filth, such as Jeluslc, laid a thick net, controlling the entire spiritual life of Austria. They still hate genius and everything progressive to this day.

Bleichsteiner refused to compile a Caucasus dictionary for the use of Hitler's army during the German occupation. He was expelled from the university, and even now he cannot hold a professorship. He is an enemy of the fascists and has translated many works by Soviet writers. This is enough for the Austrian people to oppose him. Mr. Bai said unhappily: "I love my country very much, but in today's atmosphere, it is difficult to study literature." He is right. Although fascism is hidden in Austria, it has not put down its weapons. In Austria, it is still very difficult to develop loyal democratic art and honest popular literature.

### "Bright as Lotus Emerging from Waves"

— Jin Shan

### Casual Feelings of a Trip to England

— Hu Shuyi

As soon as I arrived in England, I wanted to visit the world-famous university cities—Oxford University and Cambridge University. This eagerness was like the drunk Lu Zhishen going down the mountain, not seeing anything else, but already looking at the village with the "wine" flag hanging high, with the same interest and spirit. What's more, it was the Mid-Autumn Festival, and we chose this uniquely Chinese poetic festival to visit famous cities; it can't be said that it was an unplanned trip. I remember one evening in the autumn of 1945, several yellow-faced foreign guests in a London apartment discovered and confirmed that the day after tomorrow was the Mid-Autumn Festival. Brother W suggested, why not go to Cambridge, which has the scenery of Jiangnan, for a trip? So he immediately called several travel companions who came with him, and agreed to meet at the Poddinton subway station on the first train tomorrow morning. Our group of five, with Master Yao being the oldest, was very happy to chant poems with Brother Rui during the journey. Brother Cheng, who had been in England for many years, was of course the most qualified guide. I was temporarily asked to be the accountant, so I proposed the method of "non-accounting accountant," which is to ask each travel companion to prepay a certain amount of pounds, and I would gather them in a money bag, which would be regarded as the "public money bag." All expenses during the journey would be taken from the public money bag. Every night, I would check all the money in the public money bag, and if I found it insufficient, I would ask each travel companion to replenish it at any time. This would continue every day until the end of the trip, and then I would take out the money left in the public money bag and distribute it evenly. They said that I didn't forget to train during the trip, which was the "credit" in group life, quite smart. In fact, I was afraid of trivial accounting, and it could also be said that I was lazy.

Oxford University is located in the city of Oxford on the upper reaches of the Thames River. There are more than thirty independent colleges in the university, each with its own independent organization, with classrooms, dormitories, and grand classrooms. The day we visited was a Sunday, so the whole city was filled with the sound of church bells. Each college has its own private road to the Oxford River. There are small docks by the river for boating, and the weeping willows are as beautiful as the West Lake in China. Cambridge University has more than twenty independent colleges, distributed in the city of Cambridge. The city straddles the Cam River, and all the bridges and school buildings are antique. Each college also has a courtyard road leading to the small dock on the Cam River, surrounded by green grass, which not only serves as the only natural sports field for students, but is actually the necessary natural environment for academic research. As for the beauty and charm of the scenery, there is no difference from Oxford University, and they can complement each other!

In London, it is rare to see willows hanging in small bridges and flowing water. Only in the two university districts of Oxford and Cambridge, countless weeping willows and a long, narrow river deeply embrace a green meadow, forming an ideal environment for young men and women to study and relax. We visited the research institutes of the two universities and learned that they do not adopt the American credit system, but focus on personality cultivation, and the guidance of teachers and the learning of students. They are conducted in individual contact and conversations. Students start an academic research, which is constantly planned and gradually improved in the conversations of various professors. Therefore, the student's personality and character are thoroughly understood by the professor, and how to promote the student's research must be solved in the process of personality cultivation. This is the characteristic of Oxford and Cambridge Universities. As for university professors, each department has a fixed number. If a full professor does not leave, an associate professor can never be promoted to a full professor. There are many old teachers with white hair and beards, whose academic research has been well-known at home and abroad, but nominally they are still lecturers or associate professors. Just because there is no vacancy for a full professor. We lived in London for more than two months and felt the trouble of metropolitan life. This short trip to Oxford and Cambridge, because it has weeping willows and green willows, and fragrant grass, in this poetic and picturesque environment with suitable sunny and rainy weather, everyone's poetic inspiration burst forth. Brother Rui improvised:

"The grass is fresh on the long embankment after the rain, the west wind still likes the willows like smoke, a sound of oars counts the rows of herons, instructing the waves not to ask the year."

After reading it, I still yearn for it. The world-famous university city with Jiangnan scenery can attract tens of millions of young students!

### Flowing Water

— Yang Mou

The journey is long, accompanied by loneliness.

A stone, a blade of grass, may have stirred up a whirlpool, splashed up foam, but hurry, hurry on the distant road of life, the whirlpool is gone, the foam is hidden, it is a boundless road, without end, and no one knows.

Flowing water may give you wisdom, because it hopes that you will enlighten the mystery of life.

Life is always in a hurry, maybe poets are praising, maybe painters are depicting, but who can know the anger it accumulates? Look, crash, the flowing water is angry, the flowing water is laughing, although it still can't linger on this beautiful scenery, it still has to hurry on its way.

Without a goal, without likes or dislikes, just following the power of nature, striving to run, in the universe, is there a more boring and monotonous life than this? I am also angry for the flowing water, I am also indignant for the flowing water; however, besides sympathy, where can I send endless words?

Flowing water, you will one day be magnificent, your history will be incomparably brilliant! Flowing water!

### An Inch of Land, an Inch of Blood 519

— Ye Jingfeng

"Our China has been a land of culture and etiquette since ancient times; it is a pity that only a group of truly cultured people have always been brutally suppressed and oppressed by some autocratic demon kings, who have used all kinds of despicable means to prevent them from developing; for their own selfish interests, they have made the entire nation corrupt. Since the opening of the sea ban, it has been constantly hit by external pressure, so that those who only have a superficial understanding of Western culture look down on our country's old culture, and those who are older in mind say that this group of young people are too Westernized, and therefore are unwilling to change their thinking. This is the situation in China at this stage..."

"However, the essence of the Chinese national race is not as inferior as the Westerners publicize; at present, it is only standing at the intersection of the new and the old, wandering and hesitating, losing the national heritage for a while, and failing to grasp the true essence of the new. However, there is no need to be pessimistic; as long as it is pulled onto a great road, it will progress quickly, and it will definitely be able to walk to the front and lead this era. Although our Bairenzhuang group is small, it is now determined to adhere to this purpose and is walking in this direction."

"You don't seem to be carrying any weapons." Hejian turned his face and looked at Shouyi.

"I don't like to use that thing very much, unless the situation is too serious..." Shouyi held the helm, paid attention to the route, and replied with a smile.

"What if it becomes serious and you need it temporarily?" Hejian asked curiously.

"If it is serious, there must be more people on the other side, and more weapons; if needed, I can borrow one from them."

"Them,"

"The other side." Shouyi explained.

"Risking flying bullets to grab it?" Hejian recalled the two scenes of Xiao Laohu and Zi Shan snatching guns.

"Not necessarily so desperately..."

"I think it's always a dangerous thing... Masters who have practiced Chinese boxing are certainly quick-handed and quick-eyed; however, if they encounter an agile opponent with accurate shooting, and the two sides are a considerable distance apart, I'm afraid it won't be so easy to talk." Hejian thought that the two times Hucheng and Zishan got guns were both performances, and the actual confrontation would probably not be so satisfactory.

"The way and speed of movement are too different between those who have practiced and those who have not. From the eyes of those who have practiced, the movements of those who have not practiced are like the 'slow motion' in scientific films... unbearably slow."

"What if the other party has also practiced, and is also a shooting expert?" Hejian was still a little distrustful.

"People who have practiced, and are highly skilled, don't like to carry weapons very much; especially things like pistols. Our Zhuang is now adhering to this 'morality,' that is, even if they seize a weapon, unless the other party is an utterly evil fellow, it is difficult to use the weapon to hurt people."

### Nocturne

— Tang Kuangying

Loneliness

Pouring strong wine into a bitter cup, weeds grow in barren fields, and people sigh and regret its fate.

A daffodil grows by a dry pond, swaying in the wind. A poet walks past him indifferently, stopping under a small peach tree, carefully breaking off a branch with great pity, and offering it in a bottle on his desk. He wrote many touching poems for this little peach.

Soon, the little peach withered, and he was thrown on the side of the road by the owner with pity; looking back at the daffodil by the small pond, it was still swaying in the wind.

Who says that pouring sweet wine into a bitter cup is enough to regret, and that weeds growing in barren fields is loneliness.

Night Rain

It's night rain again.

The sound of rain stopped slightly, and I don't know who is singing a sad song in a low voice; looking out the window, it is all black, not allowing you to have a little hope.

The person listening to the song and the person singing the song are both annoyed by the night rain and sleepless through the dry and lonely feelings.

Free Talk

### Hero Worship Desire

— Bu Shu

—Also on Munich People Making a "Hitler Fortune"—

But, tomorrow, who will pick up a heavy story?

A certain Western philosopher said: "There are no heroes in front of servants." The meaning of this sentence is: the distance between the servant and the master is too small. The master may be arrogant and invincible outside, but when he returns home, he will inevitably be decadent and sad, and even shed tears at the autumn wind. Sometimes, gentlemen may also show ugliness in front of maids, forgetting the solemn appearance during the day. Sometimes, a hero who is accustomed to dressing himself in gorgeous clothes, when he takes off his clothes and is served by servants for bathing, will inevitably show a thin shape and lose the cover of gorgeousness. The Roman Emperor Nero under the pen of the Polish Henryk Sienkiewicz, and Napoleon under the pen of Japanese novelists, both appear quite embarrassed in front of servants. This is definitely not the fantasy of writers, but a possible fact. Naturally, only great philosophers and great heroes who are consistent inside and outside will not cover up their weaknesses with hypocrisy.

Gogol wrote in "Dead Souls" that Chichikov looked in the mirror and made various faces to appreciate his "flattery." This is an excellent photograph. Looking at Chichikov's private life from the keyhole is more informative about his personality than seeing Chichikov's pretentious behavior at a grand banquet. The keyhole is Gogol's secret weapon to subdue certain heroes, his great invention, and its power is perhaps no less than the atomic bomb in the eyes of "heroes" who are good at posing.

There is a considerable distance between heroes and mortals. Because of this distance, it is difficult for ordinary people to see heroes clearly. The British Thomas Carlyle said: "The desire for hero worship is also a remnant of human barbarity." This is indeed a penetrating remark, but I feel there is a need for supplementation. In my opinion, the more vigorous the desire for hero worship, the deeper the servility of the nation may be. The general public has a low level of knowledge, no confidence in themselves, or is accustomed to comforting themselves with fantasies, so they can only place their hopes on gods and heroes. In history, many great men have been smeared with color by historians, the reason being that historians want to satisfy their own fantasies and deceive themselves.

Strangely, great heroes are certainly worshiped, but arch-criminals are also viewed differently by people. As the saying goes, in the eyes of ordinary people, success is king, failure is a bandit, there is no such thing as good or evil, as long as it is "big" is good, positive and negative are not counted. The recent Munich people's big Hitler fortune is an example.

According to the Associated Press, Munich, where Hitler rose to prominence, has recently seen many forged relics. "Hitler's personally used pipe and watch" can be found on the black market. Recently, at least twenty-four pipes and nine watches have been bought at a high price of one thousand marks each? Americans seem to have a great interest in Hitler and often buy things randomly. In fact, "Hitler never smoked or loved watches during his lifetime."

Isn't this obvious enough? The distance in space plus the distance in time makes many people "look at Hitler differently," so although he is a Nazi demon king, he has after all massacred tens of millions of innocent people, and is also great and quite valuable. Once this desire for hero worship takes hold, it is a small matter that Americans' wallets are getting thinner; it is very terrible to make the general public re-evaluate the atrocities of the Nazis, and even think that Hitler is no less than a "failed hero," and encourage German youth to learn from his example.

### "Please Take Professional Course" of Gifts

— Yamaguchi

An Irishman invited his friend to his wedding anniversary and told his friend how to find his room in the apartment. He said: "Go to the seventh floor, and when you see the door with the letter D, push the button with your elbow. When the door opens, push it open with your foot."

"Why do I have to use my elbow and foot?" his friend asked puzzled.

"Oh, my God!" the Irishman shouted: "Of course you won't come empty-handed, will you?"

### Che Le in Hangzhou

— Suiren

Since the twenty-first, all entertainment venues in Hangzhou have been closed. Because the Qiaoxihu Movie Theater was destroyed by soldiers twice, and the Maggie and Jincheng theaters were also beaten one after another, some suffered heavy losses and could not resume business, and some felt that business was too insecure and were unwilling to open their doors. In order to express their support, even Peking opera, Yue opera, and miscellaneous operas were all closed. Each entertainment venue had a sign at the door that read "Following the consensus of the industry association, all businesses will be closed from today."

This situation is really very serious. I remember that in the former Qing Dynasty, wherever Che Le was unilaterally enforced, it meant that a major funeral was taking place in the area, and the people expressed their condolences. Otherwise, why would all entertainment venues in the city be closed?

I occasionally got two chapters of vulgar sentences, thinking to mourn for Hangzhou, which stopped entertainment.

"Theaters are closed door to door, and there is much discussion in long and short streets.

Soldiers strike to pacify the world, and Che Le's mourning is heartbreaking.

Entertainment merchants are worried about each other, and the songs and dances of the West Lake are temporarily suspended. The wind drives away idlers, and watching operas is now not free."

### Duke Huan of Qi's Divorce

— Xin Er

As the saying goes: "Couples quarrel to find happiness," there is nothing serious about it. Between husband and wife, there should be finding happiness, and even quarreling is a kind of finding happiness. However, the world cannot be generalized.

Han Feizi said:

"The daughter of Cai was the wife of Duke Huan. Duke Huan rode in a boat with her, and the lady swayed the boat, Duke Huan was very afraid, forbade her but could not stop her, and angrily drove her out. Then he summoned her again, and then remarried her. Duke Huan was very angry and was about to attack Cai. Zhongfu advised him: 'The play on the bed is not enough to attack the country of others, and achievements cannot be expected. Please do not use this as a reason.'"

Originally, the wife was trying to find happiness for her husband, but as a result, they got divorced, and even had to fire at her family. Fortunately, Guan Zhong persuaded him to stop. It is not very elegant to say that attacking Cai is an excuse for his wife to find happiness.

From this, it can be seen that the beginning of the war can also be caused by the "play on the bed." The wars in history, when explained, have their inevitable principles, but such causes, such as turning their faces and not recognizing relatives, are quite interesting.

Han Feizi wrote well. In the short passage quoted above, he wrote that Duke Huan was "very afraid," "angrily drove her out," and then "very angry," layer by layer, his attitude was vivid. He depicted the living face of the first hegemon of the Spring and Autumn Period.

This story shows that both Duke Huan and Lady Cai have some psychological abnormalities. In modern terms, Lady Cai probably has a bit of sadomasochistic tendency, while Duke Huan has a neurotic desire for control. His sense of dignity and authority is slightly frustrated, and he becomes angry.

It is not easy to describe these two kinds of personalities. They are rarely seen in works of art. There is an old Russian novel that describes a man with a sadomasochistic tendency who calls a prostitute to strip naked in the snow and beats her severely, naturally paying her money. The latter, with Charlie Chaplin's portrayal of Hitler, grasps it most uniquely.

I often think: Hitler or Mussolini, when addressing the crowd with wide eyes and sticking out his chin, would never use that expression to deal with his mistress, right? Because this is "human nature," looking at Duke Huan of Qi, I feel that it cannot be generalized. However, this is probably also human nature.

### Story of Fearing Foreigners

— From Yunjian

After the Gengzi year (1900) of the late Qing dynasty, the policy changed from anti-foreign to pro-foreign. The power of foreign churches became extremely influential, leading to the saying, "The common people fear officials, and officials fear foreigners." During that time, Geng Gongda from Yunjian was intelligent and resourceful. He served as the Circuit Intendant of western Yunnan. In one of the subordinate counties, some unscrupulous people, relying on the power of the church, forcibly occupied people's land. The county government did not dare to make a decision. Geng personally interrogated them, but the unscrupulous people, feeling secure, insulted the official. Geng was enraged and had them detained. The next day, a letter arrived from a priest, siding with the unscrupulous people and requesting their release. Geng resumed the court session, brought in the unscrupulous people, showed them the priest's letter, slammed the table, and scolded loudly: "You rely on the power of the priest. I can give up my official position, but I cannot let you go unpunished!" He then tore the priest's letter into pieces and threw them into the air. The unscrupulous people were returned to custody. The next morning, the priest arrived at the office in a sedan chair, requesting an audience. The priest was furious and loudly said to Geng, "I requested the release of a church member, but you not only refused, but also tore my letter! This is an insult! If there is no appropriate solution, I will report this to the consul for serious negotiation." Geng then said, "Please sit down, Father, why are you angry? That church member is cunning and hateful, bullying good people on a daily basis and committing all kinds of evil. Even with your letter, the decision to approve or deny is in my hands. Why would I tear the letter? I have been an official for many years, how could I act rashly like this?" He then took out the original letter from the priest and showed it to him. He further said, "That church member is not only deceiving the officials, but also deceiving the priest, causing you to trouble yourself early in the morning. I feel very uneasy. That church member must be severely punished. Does the Father agree?" The priest was speechless and repeatedly said, "Yes, yes." After the unscrupulous people were severely punished, the church members no longer dared to act recklessly. In reality, what Geng tore was not the priest's letter, but a cover for a cooking pot.

### American Legal Aid Society for Common People

— Renqi

According to a report: The local Bar Association will organize a "Legal Aid Committee for Common People" to represent common people in court or provide legal arguments, etc. It is said. This kind of organization is still a novelty in China, but it was established in Chicago, USA seven years ago, and the results have been remarkable.

Ordinary people, including those in America, are always confused when legal disputes arise and allow things to develop until they become serious and irreparable before seeking advice from a lawyer. This is because they do not understand the procedures for hiring a lawyer on the one hand, and they worry about the high costs on the other. Nearly three-quarters of matters are resolved without obtaining legal advice, and many people suffer losses as a result. Several lawyers in Chicago with a strong sense of public service, recognizing this, planned to organize an advisory lawyer association and asked the Chicago Bar Association to support it. The aim was to enable ordinary people in need of legal advice to obtain the services of a qualified lawyer to handle their cases at a very low cost. The association has one secretary who is permanently stationed in the association to solve problems or introduce lawyers. Its office is always crowded, with forty or fifty people visiting every day for help. The secretary himself is a lawyer, and most inquiries are resolved by him in a few words without the need to consult other lawyers. This service is free of charge. If a lawyer is needed to handle the case, the secretary will assign one from the registered lawyers. The client only needs to pay a consultation fee of three US dollars to discuss everything. If other services are needed, the fees are also very low. The association has three hundred registered lawyers, including several famous lawyers in Chicago, who handle ordinary civil lawsuits, criminal lawsuits, tax lawsuits, and labor lawsuits according to their respective expertise.

Since the association was established in Chicago, similar organizations have been established in Philadelphia, Los Angeles, Cincinnati, New York, and other places. It is expected that a national organization will be established soon.

Some people worry that this convenience will cultivate the habit of litigation among the people, but based on the situation in Chicago, this concern is purely unnecessary. Most of those seeking help only need some advice and common sense. Based on this knowledge, they can avoid the trouble of legal disputes. People who do evil can also be deterred by the increase in people's legal knowledge. Therefore, I sincerely hope that the Legal Aid Committee for Common People, which will be established in this city, can also help the common people as much as possible, uphold justice, reduce people's losses, and give full play to the lawyers' high efficiency. This would be fortunate for the common people and fortunate for society. (This article is taken from the American Magazine "Zhi Yue" Issue)

### Record of a City in Danger

— Qin Shouou

An old man with hunched shoulders slowly crawled out of a pile of rubble. From twenty or thirty yards away, he pointed at Lao Zhu with a trembling finger. His eyes were staring straight ahead, and he stumbled step by step, his feet seeming weak and his body constantly swaying.

The aimless cursing had unexpectedly caused trouble, which made Lao Zhu feel somewhat disturbed and very surprised.

"No, old man, I wasn't cursing you!"

"Ah! Is that Little Lin? Yes! It's you!" As he got closer, Lao Zhu realized that the person wasn't old. It was just that his face was covered in dust, his beard and hair were disheveled, and his spirit was particularly weak, so he looked like an old man from a distance. His eyes were not only staring straight ahead but also covered in bloodshot veins, as if he were drunk. He didn't seem to hear Lao Zhu's explanation and suddenly changed his tone, opening his arms and staggering straight towards him.

At this time, Zhu Zhaonian had clearly seen that he was a madman, but he wasn't afraid. He still looked him up and down, and he noticed that the clothes the man was wearing, although dirty now, were made of the finest materials, and his pair of unlaced yellow leather shoes were still in the Shanghai style.

"Little Lin! Do you want gold? Speak up! Speak up!" The madman gradually approached and grabbed Lao Zhu's shoulders with both hands, shaking him violently. "Don't hesitate, I know that what you want is gold!"

"Sir, wake up! I'm not Little Lin, you need to wake up!" Zhu Zhaonian gently moved his hands away, raising his voice to shout at him, but his face remained kind and lifeless.

The madman suddenly laughed, but he laughed so miserably that Lao Zhu couldn't bear to look at him.

"Little Lin, you're angry! Aren't you?" He patted Lao Zhu's shoulder forcefully and said, "That's right, I'm sorry for you! You asked to borrow an ounce of gold, and I wouldn't even give it to you. But, Little Lin, I'll tell you!" He suddenly lowered his voice, looking extremely secretive. "Gold is really a good thing, our lives depend on it to be preserved. Paper money is useless; when the dynasty changes, it's worthless. Gold is different, it's shiny, heavy, valuable to the Chinese, and valuable to the Japanese! Hahaha!" Then he burst into wild laughter again. "With gold, you can escape! Right? Little Lin."

"Then, sir, haven't you already escaped to Jinchengjiang?" Lao Zhu couldn't bear to tease him, but he finally couldn't help but ask this rhetorical question.

New Knowledge

### New Type of American Camera

Ray, manager and head of the research department of Polaroid Corporation in Cambridge, Massachusetts, has recently invented a new type of camera. After the shutter is pressed, the camera can complete the procedures of developing and fixing within fifty seconds, and print a perfect positive image photograph and a negative film. The camera is equipped with a roll of film and a roll of printing paper at both ends. When a certain scene is captured by the lens, rotating the film and printing paper in the camera will press them tightly together. At the same time, the chemical agent pod attached to the printing paper roll will break due to the pressure of the roll, causing the agent to spread on the printing paper and start developing and fixing. Then, the film and printing paper will go through the knife cutting process installed in the machine, and then be built into a combined piece of paper, which will slide out of the machine. After this combined piece of paper is separated, it will become a positive image photograph and a negative film.

The figure shows the inventor of the new camera, Mr. Schroeder, and his positive image and film. The image completes all photography procedures within fifty seconds. The attached diagram on the right shows the new camera and device, and explains how the various steps in photography can be completed quickly within fifty seconds. (US Information Agency)

### Recent Situation of Hirohito

— Bosheng

The "Constitution of Japan" was implemented on May 3rd, with Article 1 stipulating that "the Emperor is the symbol of the State of Japan" rather than a special kind. MacArthur's intention is the same as the opinion of Japanese constitutional experts that this provision is in line with the people's livelihood. However, the Japanese people are becoming more and more respectful of this symbol!

Hirohito, learning "democracy", received Japanese reporters on May 2nd and made direct questions and answers. This is an unprecedented event. However, the questions asked by the Japanese reporters are of no great importance, and Hirohito's answers are certainly not about "military plans"!

April 29th was Hirohito's forty-sixth birthday, the so-called "Tencho-setsu" by the Japanese. This year, the symbolic birthday celebration means that everyone has a day off, but the newspapers did not publish a picture of the Emperor, which is slightly different from the scenes in previous years.

Hirohito's current life is simple and quiet, and he is trying his best to maintain his health. Except for Sundays, he starts working at 9 am every day. His weight is now 140 pounds. He has quit smoking and drinking, and rarely contacts women. His only hobby is still studying plants.

Please note that Hirohito is now living the life of Goujian, enduring hardship and biding his time. Deep in his heart, isn't he thinking of Wu Fuchai!
