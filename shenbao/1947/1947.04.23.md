### Formal Establishment of the National Government Committee; Chairman Chiang Decides to Personally Deliver a Speech; Presidents of the Five Yuan and Government Committee Members to Take Office Simultaneously

[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 22nd] The reorganized National Government Committee is scheduled to hold its first meeting at 10:00 AM on the 23rd in the National Government Auditorium. Approximately 23 government committee members are expected to attend. Chairman Chiang and Vice Chairman Sun will both be present. The presidents of the various Yuan will attend as ex officio members. This marks the first time in the 20 years since the establishment of the National Government that members of the Kuomintang, other political parties, and non-party individuals will gather to jointly discuss practical political affairs. People across the country and around the world place boundless hope in this new Government Committee, hoping that it will promote a new spirit, establish a new style, select new personnel, and implement new policies. This will shorten the period of tutelage government to achieve a transition to constitutional government, complete preparations for the realization of democratic constitutionalism, and pave a clear path for the construction of a new China. The participation of people from various parties in the Government Committee is somewhat similar in form to the Political Consultative Conference (PCC), but the tasks of the two are vastly different. The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and the Democratic League, which participated in the PCC to jointly discuss reorganization, have refused to participate in this reorganization of the government. There are no CCP or Democratic League figures within the committee, but the government still reserves places, leaving them vacant. Chairman Chiang will deliver a brief speech before the meeting, after which the rules of procedure drafted by the Office of Civil Affairs will be discussed first. The new President of the Executive Yuan, Zhang Qun, will also present a list of ministers and political committee members to be approved at the meeting. There are a total of 28 new government committee members. Wu Xianzai of the Democratic Socialist Party is in Hong Kong and will only be able to arrive in Shanghai from Hong Kong on the 23rd before transferring to Nanjing. He Luzhi of the Youth Party is ill in Shanghai and unable to attend the meeting in Nanjing. Therefore, those expected to attend tomorrow are approximately as follows: Zhang Qun, Sun Ke, Yu Youren, Dai Chuanxian (Ju Zheng is in Hankou and unable to attend), Zhang Ji, Zou Lu, Song Ziwen, Weng Wenhao, Wang Chonghui, Shao Lizi, Wang Shijie, Jiang Menglin, Niu Yongjian, Liang Hancao, Chen Zai Lei, Zeng Qi of the Youth Party, Chen Qitian, Yu Jiaju, Hu Haimen of the Democratic Socialist Party, Ji Yiqiao, and prominent figures Mo Dehui and Wang Yunwu. Although Zeng Qi is ill in the Central Hospital, he has decided to make an effort to attend.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 22nd] The reorganized National Government Committee is scheduled to be formally established on the 23rd. At the same time, the newly appointed National Government Committee members and presidents of the five Yuan will be formally sworn into office. No separate swearing-in ceremony will be held. It is reported that at the meeting tomorrow, the Chief of Civil Affairs, Wu Dingchang, will first explain the significance of the government reorganization, followed by a speech from Chairman Chiang. After a short break, the meeting will formally begin. The agenda for discussion will be the rules of the National Government Committee meeting. It is heard that the reorganization of the Executive Yuan will also be brought up for discussion, and the selection of political committee members and heads of various ministries and commissions will be decided.

[Another Dispatch] Regarding the selection of another government committee member from the Democratic Socialist Party, members of the party all look to Xu Fulin. Since Mr. Xu came to Nanjing to meet with Chairman Chiang, he has been considering this matter. According to Jiang Yuntian, there are probably no problems.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 22nd] The Standing Committee of the Central Executive Committee and the National Defense Council are scheduled to hold a joint meeting at 9:00 AM on the 23rd. This is likely the last gathering of the National Defense Council, as the duties of the National Defense Council will be largely transferred to the Government Committee on the same day.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 22nd] Following the reorganization of the National Government, vice presidents of the five Yuan will also be selected soon. With Wei Daoming assuming the position of Chairman of the Taiwan Province, it is expected that the vacancy for the Vice President of the Legislative Yuan will be filled in the near future, with Jiao Yitang and Liu Zhe being possible candidates. However, it is heard that the Democratic and Youth Parties are also quite interested in this position. As for the vice presidents of the Control Yuan and the Judicial Yuan, they also need to be selected following the passing of Liu Shangqing and Qin Zhen. What is currently known is that Zhou Zhongyue, the Vice President of the Examination Yuan, will likely continue in his position. It has been internally decided that Wang Yunwu will assume the position of Vice President of the Executive Yuan.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 22nd] Ji Yiqiao and Hu Haimen of the Democratic Socialist Party arrived in Nanjing from Shanghai on the morning of the 22nd, accompanied by Lei Zhen. The three visited Zhang Qun one after another to discuss the reorganization of the Executive Yuan. Xu Fulin is scheduled to take the night train to Shanghai on the 23rd to participate in the Government Committee affairs, which will be decided after arriving in Shanghai.

Although the candidates have been internally decided, the list has not been sent out tonight because the matter of joining the government still needs to be discussed with the government, such as the method of participation, such as participating in local governments. A meeting will be held again on the morning of the 23rd to discuss this.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch of the 22nd] The new Government Committee member, Song Ziwen, arrived in Nanjing from Shanghai at 9:30 AM on the 22nd to participate in the first Government Committee meeting convened after the reorganization on the 23rd.

### Hu Haimen and Ji Yiqiao Issue Statement on Participating in the National Government

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 22nd] Hu Haimen and Ji Yiqiao of the Chinese Democratic Socialist Party issued a statement on the 22nd regarding their participation in the National Government. The original text is as follows: The purpose of the Democratic Socialist Party's participation in the National Assembly is to seek the passage of a constitution that complies with the principles of the Political Consultative Conference (PCC), establish a model of democratic constitutionalism, and move our country one step forward towards democracy. Although the Communist Party insists on its views and did not participate in the National Assembly, it is indeed a regrettable matter. However, the promulgation of the democratic constitution is the foundation for the implementation of democratic politics. In politics, it ends the one-party rule of the Kuomintang and embarks on the road to democracy.

After the promulgation of the democratic constitution, our party naturally does not want it to become a mere formality. There are still issues related to the implementation of constitutionalism, such as the formulation of election laws and other laws, which the Kuomintang cannot handle alone. Therefore, our party has decided to participate in the four institutions.

Our party is formed by the merger of the National Socialist Party and the Democratic Constitutionalist Party. It is still in the preparatory stage of organization. It originally intended to cultivate its own development as an opposition party, while assisting the government in implementing constitutionalism, hoping to make efforts for one or two decades to enable our country to implement democratic socialism. Because of this purpose, in the statement of participating in the four institutions on February 15, there was the statement "As for shouldering the actual responsibility of decision-making and administration, it will wait until all parties in the country work together for peace and democracy."

However, things did not go as planned. The Kuomintang government authorities earnestly stated that if all parties do not participate in the reorganized government during this transitional period, the Supreme National Defense Committee cannot be abolished, and the one-party tutelage of the Kuomintang cannot be ended. Our party has always advocated the implementation of democratic constitutionalism by peaceful means and opposes any form of one-party rule. Today, the Kuomintang has the intention of ending one-party rule, and our party cannot refuse people from thousands of miles away. Therefore, there is the signing of the twelve points of common governance principles and the decision to participate in the reorganized government. Our party hopes to reflect some of the people's appeals from these twelve points and participate in the government as representatives of a part of the people to urge the administration to adapt to the people's demands in implementation. We want to clearly tell the world that this participation in the government is to help the government end tutelage and absolutely oppose the so-called joint tutelage of the three parties. Our actions are to seek the realization of democratic politics, to relieve the people from suffering, not to gain a position of tutelage by one party, let alone to seek any benefits for the party itself. We can also sincerely tell the people that our participation in the government this time reserves the freedom of advance and retreat and is prepared for sacrifice.

Therefore, our party's participation in the reorganized government this time takes the twelve points as the basic program, and its essence is nothing more than three: First, to promote the peaceful unification of our country; second, to establish the foundation of democratic rule of law; and third, to represent the people in seeking to relieve their suffering and reduce social disorder. Our party will, in a responsible spirit, strive to realize the above-mentioned platform, and hereby formally inform the people of the country, hoping that the people of the country will be our support, and encourage each other with our party comrades.

[Our Shenyang Dispatch of the 22nd] Regarding the Lushun Sino-Soviet Joint Committee, our side has already decided to send Dong Yanping. It is heard that the other candidate has been internally decided as Zhu Mao or Tang Huang.

(2) Add the position of deputy director to each department of the Taiwan Provincial Government. All these deputy directors will be Taiwanese. Although Taiwanese are completely Chinese, after 51 years of Japanese occupation, two generations have been separated from the motherland.

[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 22nd] The National Army in Shandong Province is tightening its encirclement of the Communist army retreating to the Yimeng Mountain area. The National Army has been advancing steadily on all roads in recent days. On the 21st, it advanced to the Tangtou and Chayeshan line north of Linyi, to the Bancheng (south of Qingtuo Temple) line in the northwest, and to the Zhuman-Chengyang line northeast of Feixian County. The National Army of Sishui Baibai advanced northeastward from Zhongtong and Daqiao and other places. On the 21st, it captured Guanzhuang, Tiantai Mountain, Wutou Mountain, Majiayu and other strongholds respectively, and after recovering Gongli east of Loude, it continued to advance towards Xintai. It is expected that the National Army will have brilliant results on all roads within three to five days.

[Another Telegram] The Qiu Corps of the National Army Tang Enbo yesterday launched a counterattack against the Communist army in northern Linyi, with brilliant results. The eastern route advanced to Tangtou Town between Linyi and Juxian, which is 42 li away from Linyi and is an important stronghold for the Communist army to connect the two sides of the Yi River. There are five pontoon bridges nearby. With this, the National Army has cut off the connection between the Communist army on the east bank of the Yi River and the Yimeng Mountain area. The central route advanced to Chayeshan between Linyi and Yishui. The mountain is 40 li away from Linyi and is the only high ground that protects the north of Linyi. The western route advanced to Bancheng between Linyi and Mengyin. The area is 45 li away from Linyi and is the throat of Linyi leading to Mengyin. All of the above strongholds have been operated by the Communist army for seven years and have strong fortifications. The main force of the Communist army, which resisted stubbornly on the line, seems to be the 6th Column. It was heroically and painfully attacked by the Tang Corps and collapsed northward. The Tang Corps is still chasing north in victory.

[Another Telegram] The National Army in Xishan, Yimeng Mountain area, started climbing the mountain on the morning of the 22nd and engaged in fierce fighting with the guard troops of the Communist Army's 1st Column in Haitai Mountain, Majiayu and other places about 20 li away from Mengyin City.

Now, the 1237th Column of the Let Bocheng Department moved north from the area west of Hua County and north of the Wei River on the 21st, claiming to attack Tangyin again. Judging from his intentions, it seems to avoid the National Army's advance.

### Hong Kong Government Controls US Dollar Exchange; Said to be Mainly for Self-Sufficiency

[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 22nd] The Hong Kong government's suspension of approving US dollar exchange applications from importers on the 12th has caused repercussions. A Hong Kong government spokesperson issued a statement on the 21st, explaining the truth, saying that the amount of US dollars that the UK obtained through borrowing is small, and must be used sparingly. The Hong Kong government must also seek self-sufficiency in US dollar transactions, and pointed out that the reason for the Hong Kong government's strict control of US dollar exchange is that remittances from overseas Chinese in the US to Hong Kong are now using bank drafts payable in the US, and Hong Kong exporters are receiving US dollar payments in the US, so that the Hong Kong government cannot purchase US dollars. The spokesperson continued to say that British people in Hong Kong must sell their US dollars to the government at the official rate, but Chinese people can still keep their US dollars, but no one is allowed to buy or sell foreign currency privately.

Today, his bloody clothes are buried in the Jiangbian Jishan.

Taicang

Wei Qianwan area in the city center is the central business district of the city. On the 18th night, the Deyi Paper Store suddenly caught fire, and the flames quickly spread to the roof. Because the original fire-fighting equipment had not yet been restored, the fire was allowed to burn, completely destroying everything from Caishi Lane in the east to Dabeimen Street in the west. The loss is inestimable.

Wujiang

A few students from the Provincial Rural Normal School purchased tickets to Suzhou at the Wujiang Station of the Sujiahu Automobile Company at about 5 PM on the 20th.

Editorial

### The Necessity of Improving Price Negotiation

The recent wave of price increases has many causes. Moreover, the reasons for the rise in the prices of various goods are not entirely the same. For example, the price of rice is said to be due to rising production costs, the price of oil due to a shortage of raw materials, and the price of cotton cloth due to expensive raw materials and sales promotions. Therefore, measures to suppress prices must be sought from multiple perspectives, which is naturally an undeniable truth. However, to eliminate speculation and eradicate black markets, it seems that there is still a need to improve the application of price negotiation.

In addition to using loans, opening up sources, and increasing production as fundamental solutions to suppress prices, the authorities seem to have two stopgap measures: one is a rigid approach, namely adopting price negotiation methods to guide prices towards reasonable and legitimate channels. By using both approaches simultaneously, combining firmness and flexibility, if applied properly, it seems that a considerable effect of moderating prices can be achieved to some extent.

However, judging from the market situation in recent weeks, the wave of price increases has been extremely intense. Even if there is an occasional pullback, it is nothing more than a large increase followed by a small decrease, still rising along a curved line. Moreover, the black market is rampant, and speculators are emerging in droves. Manufacturers who care about their reputation are forced to comply with price negotiations and understand that they are losing money, so they all reluctantly make sacrifices and complain loudly. This is most evident in the cotton cloth sector. Consequently, the authorities' strict investigations and handling methods have not achieved significant results. There is no mystery in this. It is simply because the profits are too high and the money is made too quickly, so speculators are willing to take risks by any means possible and are happy to test the law. On the other hand, producers feel it is a pity to miss out on huge profits, so they cannot help but take risks and venture into the black market.

If market prices can be adjusted in a timely manner to prevent them from being too detached from reality, then excessive profits will be reduced, and the arrogance of speculators can be greatly diminished. On the supply side, since the losses will not be too great, they may not be willing to break the law and secretly sell in the black market. According to Article 13 of the Implementation Regulations for Price Assessment, when there are drastic changes in the cost of goods and there is a need to assess new prices, renegotiation is permitted, and there is no time limit. Furthermore, Article 10 of the same regulations states that the calculation of the cost of goods, in addition to manufacturing costs or the original purchase price, may include interest, taxes, transportation costs, warehouse rent, management fees, insurance, and depreciation. According to these regulations, reasonable prices are not difficult to obtain. Moreover, the proviso of Article 13 clearly stipulates that prices cannot be increased before being approved. Article 15 also stipulates that those who violate the approved price negotiation can be punished in accordance with the regulations on cracking down on violations of price limits and price negotiation. If this can be implemented, not only will merchants and civilians not blindly rush around and easily fall into legal traps, but the government's law enforcement will also be more convenient to carry out. Therefore, we can choose not to discuss price negotiation. But once price negotiation has been implemented, timely and reasonable adjustments seem necessary.

Some people believe that frequent changes in negotiated prices will only fuel price increases. In times of scarcity and when supply and demand cannot meet, this drawback is indeed unavoidable. However, in such circumstances, if there is no fundamental solution and one relies solely on passive measures to curb prices, this is, in fact, questionable. As in recent times, the authorities' supervision and punishment have been vigorous and diligent, but the wave of price increases has been difficult to eliminate, and the black market remains rampant, which can be said to be clear evidence. Rather than sticking to fixed negotiated prices without allowing flexibility, which only leads to a rampant black market that cannot be suppressed, it is better to adjust prices according to the law, which can still achieve a considerable effect of moderation.

Taking the price of cotton cloth as an example, the cost has indeed reached around five million recently, while the negotiated price has always been within the four million range. It is said that the authorities are also well aware of this unreasonable restriction. However, once adjusted, the negotiated price will inevitably be raised, which will inevitably be subject to criticism. It is better to turn a blind eye and let things take their course, which can avoid personal responsibility. It is not known whether such a style of work actually amounts to creating a black market, fueling speculation, and causing merchants who seek immediate gains to adopt improper conduct. The national price negotiation policy will then invisibly diminish its credibility and value. We believe that this is an unwise and irresponsible action before the price negotiation policy has been clearly changed.

### Marshall Urges Senate to Pass Aid to Greece and Turkey Bill, Says He Fully Agrees with the Plan

[United Press International, Washington, 21st] The Senate's discussion of President Truman's plan to aid Greece and Turkey will be put to a vote tomorrow, and it is certain to pass. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Vandenberg read a telegram from Secretary of State Marshall from Moscow today, stating: "Senator Vandenberg: I am aware that some questions have arisen regarding my involvement in the plan to aid Greece and Turkey. As you know, I participated in the drafting and decision-making of this plan before departing for Moscow. On March 26, when I arrived in Paris, the President telegraphed me the message he intended to present to Congress on March 12, and I immediately informed the State Department of my full agreement. I personally and the State Department have urged the immediate passage of the aid bill. I believe this plan is necessary, and I fully agree with the State Department's and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman's urging of Congress to pass this bill." Marshall's telegram was prompted by questions from Republican Senator Wiley. Wiley told the Senate last week that there were rumors that Marshall did not fully agree with the policy of aid to Greece and Turkey.

[Associated Press, Washington, 21st] Truman and Marshall made important arrangements today to support the aid to Greece and Turkey bill, which is expected to pass in the Senate tomorrow. Truman reiterated his support for this measure to resist communist influence in the Near East, while Marshall followed suit, sending a letter from Moscow urging the Senate to pass the promised $400 million loan, considering it to be "of utmost importance."

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 21st] Republican Senator Ferguson returned from the Middle East and recently gave a speech expressing his support for the US plan to aid Greece and Turkey. It is said that the only way to make the Soviet Union stop its psychological warfare against Turkey is for Turkey and the Soviet Union to form an agreement guaranteeing Turkey's borders. I propose transferring the existing lend-lease materials from Egypt and Iran to Greece and Turkey. I do not think that Britain will object to this, as we are currently relieving Britain of its burden in the Near East, but Britain will still share its benefits. As long as Turkey has to spend most of its budget on maintaining troops, it will not be able to improve its position politically and economically. United Nations agencies must obtain sufficient power to guarantee the inviolability of the borders of small countries, so that the United States does not have to be asked to intervene every time a new crisis threatens world security.

### Molotov's Reply to Marshall Explains Soviet Stance on Korea, US-Soviet Joint Commission Expected to Resume Work

[Our News] London, 22nd Broadcast: Molotov wrote to Marshall, accusing the United States of violating the Moscow Agreement on the Korean issue, but agreed that the United States and the Soviet Union should make renewed efforts to promote the unification of Korea. Molotov suggested that the US-Soviet Joint Commission on Korean issues meet in Seoul on May 20. [United Press International, Moscow, 22nd] Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov today replied to a letter from US Secretary of State Marshall, proposing that the US-Soviet Joint Commission on Korean Affairs resume work in Seoul on May 20. Molotov's reply also put forward three suggestions: (1) To form a temporary Korean government, with the unanimous participation of various democratic parties and public organizations in the country, to promote political and economic unification, abolish the demarcation line between the northern and southern occupied areas, and complete independence. (2) To hold free and equal general elections to establish a democratic parliament. (3) To assist the Korean people in their revival into an independent and democratic country, and to develop their national economy and culture. The so-called assistance is obviously to be jointly provided by the United States and the Soviet Union. In two letters to Molotov on the 8th of this month, Marshall urged two steps to resolve the Korean issue: (1) Resume the work of the US-Soviet Joint Commission to find ways to complete Korean independence based on respect for democratic rights and freedom of speech. (2) For the US and Soviet governments to review the work of the committee on a date to be selected this summer. The committee completely stalled in May last year due to disagreements between US and Soviet representatives on which democratic parties and public organizations should have a say in politics. Molotov's reply was dated April 19 and was released today, with copies sent to British Foreign Secretary Bevin and Chinese Ambassador to the Soviet Union Chuan Bingchang.

### Remnants of Japanese Troops on Palau Island Surrender

[Central News Agency, Honolulu, 21st, Associated Press] Remnants of Japanese troops entrenched on Palau Island in the South Pacific surrendered after being swept by the US Navy.

[Agence France-Presse, Tokyo, 22nd] At the opening of the Far East International Tribunal today, US defense lawyer Lazarus presented the history of communist activities in Europe and Asia to prove that the anti-communist policy of the Japanese militarists was correct.

### The Issue of Palestine's Independence

Egypt Requests Inclusion in UN General Assembly Agenda

[United Press International, Lake Success, 21st] Egypt today formally requested that the United Nations terminate Britain's 25-year mandate in Palestine, immediately declare the Holy Land an independent country, and request that this motion be submitted for discussion at the United Nations General Assembly special session to be held in New York on the 20th of this month.

[United Press International, Lake Success, 22nd] According to initial investigations today, the United States and the United Kingdom can obtain sufficient support from countries in the United Nations to prevent Arab countries from demanding the immediate independence of Palestine. It is heard that the South American countries are preparing to take a neutral stance on this dispute, but have strongly indicated that they oppose the inclusion of Egypt's proposal in the agenda of this meeting.

### Drafting Committee on Atomic Energy, Deadlock in Work

[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 22nd] The drafting committee of the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission has held four meetings without reaching an agreement and adjourned last night. Soviet representative Gromyko refused to explain the definition of "control and supervision" in his amendments. At the same time, the timing of the implementation of control is also a major point of contention. The Soviet Union insisted on implementing it "immediately" after the signing of the international atomic energy convention, while the United States favored using the phrase "as soon as possible." The Polish representative proposed a compromise, but it did not succeed, so the meeting was postponed and will reopen on the 30th of this month if conditions permit.

### Four Foreign Ministers' Secret Meeting Discusses Difficulties in Austrian Peace Treaty, German Issue Likely to Be Temporarily Shelved

[Associated Press, Moscow, 22nd] The four foreign ministers held their second secret meeting today, attempting to eliminate differences of opinion on the Austrian peace treaty. According to authoritative sources: "In this heart-pounding meeting, the hope of reaching an Austrian peace treaty has not been completely cut off."

[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 21st] At 5:45 PM today, US Secretary of State General Marshall believed that continuing the discussion would be useless and suggested holding a secret meeting. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov immediately agreed. According to responsible sources: In the secret meeting, Marshal Marshall asked the foreign ministers of the three countries whether they still insisted on their original proposals on several basic points on which no agreement had been reached. He asked Foreign Minister Molotov if the Soviet government had any room for reconsideration of the proposal he made at the secret meeting on April 1 regarding the issue of reparations extracted from Germany's current production. If there was no room for reconsideration, Marshall would request the adjournment of the foreign ministers' meeting, but the time and place of the next meeting must be stipulated. After the secret meeting adjourned, opinions on the success of the secret meeting varied, but it was also said that the issue of German property in Austria and the Austrian border issue would soon be resolved. It can be asserted that the four foreign ministers' meeting will no longer discuss the German issue. Even the US side said that the secret meeting only discussed the Austrian peace treaty issue. British Foreign Secretary Bevin and French Foreign Minister Bidault believed several days ago that such fruitless debates should be stopped immediately and that an agreement could only be reached after the foreign ministers had deliberated at length and held a new meeting. If the four foreign ministers' meeting adjourns, the four foreign ministers will not have achieved their goals. In other words, Marshal Marshall failed to unify the German economy, British Foreign Secretary Bevin failed to reduce the burden on British taxpayers, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov failed to obtain reparations from West Germany, and French Foreign Minister Bidault was unable to satisfy his demands for the Saar region, and only obtained a few coal mines. Without the Saar region, everything is worthless.

### Legal Rent, Opening Up Real Estate as Collateral: Real Estate Industry Suggests Three Items; Executive Yuan Orders Municipal Government to Investigate and Handle

[Our Correspondent] The Shanghai Real Estate Industry Association previously stated that the real estate industry has not received sufficient support from the government. On the contrary, it has been subject to excessive and detailed restrictions by laws and regulations, making it difficult to recover. It is not allowed to use real estate as collateral in the banking industry, causing a large number of good assets to lose their value. Therefore, they drafted three measures to save the housing shortage and suggested that the Executive Yuan adopt them: (1) The restriction on rent should be based on Article 97 of the Land Law promulgated in April 1946, which states that the rent "shall not exceed 10% per annum of the declared total value of the land and its buildings." (2) After the rent is reasonably adjusted according to the Land Law, the ban on using real estate as collateral should be lifted. National banks should provide mortgage loans for real estate, but only for the construction of new houses and other productive businesses. (3) A land bank should be established as soon as possible to provide long-term capital to support the real estate industry.

It is now known that the first two of the above suggestions have been approved by the Executive Yuan's President Chiang, and ordered to be handled by the Shanghai Municipal Government. The third item has been forwarded to the Ministry of Finance. After receiving the order, the Municipal Government ordered the Land Administration Bureau and the Counselor's Office to investigate and handle the matter, and forwarded it to the Municipal Council for review.

### Denies Connection with Yu Ying and Wu Shibao: Yang Qing's Traitor Suspect Case Concluded, Verdict Pending

[Our Correspondent] Yang Qing, accused of being a traitor, concluded his trial in the High Court yesterday, and the verdict is scheduled to be announced on the morning of the 29th. Yang is accused of having been a disciple of Lu Ying, the puppet Shanghai Police Bureau chief, and having been a guard for Wu Shibao, a major figure in "No. 76." As a result, he served as deputy squad leader of the judicial section of the puppet Xujiahui Police Branch in 1938, and in 1944 he served as deputy captain of the Sixth Detective Team of the puppet Shanghai Special Municipal Police Bureau, and was later promoted to captain. After the victory, he continued to serve as a patrol officer in the Xujiahui branch. Later, relevant authorities reported him for handling according to law. The defendant, dressed in a light gray tunic, bald, and with a sorrowful face, admitted to his puppet positions without hesitation, but denied any connection with Yu Ying and Wu Shibao. He argued that he was forced by circumstances, as his 78-year-old mother and seven children had nothing to live on. Previously, during the investigation hearing, many merchants from the Xujiahui area testified in court, proving that the defendant had not committed any crimes detrimental to the people. Yang Qing further stated: "I did arrest small thieves and pickpockets, but I never arrested any underground workers." Subsequently, defense lawyer Yu Enliang argued that the informant in this case, Ma, had falsely accused the defendant out of spite after failing to extort money. If the defendant really had any connection with Yu Ying and Wu Shibao, he would have been reported by the police bureau long ago. How could he have been re-employed at the Xujiahui branch for a year after the victory? He asked the court to investigate carefully. Finally, Judge Xiao concluded: The debate in this case is over, the verdict will be announced on the 29th, and the defendant is allowed to meet with his family before being returned to custody.

[Our Correspondent] Zhou Buyun, 21 years old, from Jiangxi, was staying at No. 17, Daming Hotel, North Tibet Road. On the morning of the 18th, dressed in uniform, he accompanied his friend Zhang Rerefu to the home of Zhang Zhengfu (a barber from Rugao) at No. 199, Pingmin Village, North Zhabei Road.

After receiving the above instructions, the Municipal Government, in addition to ordering the various district offices to comply, in order to complete the summary report within the deadline, the deadline for receiving forms is the end of July this year, and will not be extended again.

### Unscrupulous Sons of Wealthy Families Issue Checks Fraudulently Everywhere: Jiang Xincheng is Not at All Sincere

[Our Correspondent] Jiang Xincheng, also known as Jiang Liu, a young man in this city, went to Kang Sheng Leather Shoe Store at No. F358, Huashan Road, at 4:00 PM on March 11 to buy a pair of shoes, priced at 130,000 yuan. He paid 60,000 yuan in cash at the time and signed a check for 70,000 yuan from Yuanheng Money Shop. The check was later returned due to insufficient funds. The store owner, Yan Yinshui, reported the incident to the police bureau. Another man, Yuan Yinbing from Changzhou, also accused Jiang Xincheng of using a bad check for 139,000 yuan at his restaurant on March 9. The police bureau went to Yuanheng Money Shop to investigate and found that Jiang Xincheng opened an account on March 5 and received a checkbook. He had continuously issued about 20 bad checks, totaling 2,357,000 yuan. The address he left at the money shop was also fictitious, and he had no fixed residence. On the evening of April 7, at 11:00 PM, he was arrested by the Jing'an Temple Inspection Branch at his friend's house at No. 27, Anle Lane, West Nanjing Road. The case was transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office yesterday. According to Jiang's confession, he had been accused of fraud in a similar situation before and was acquitted by the court. His father runs a business in this city and is quite wealthy, but he cut off his financial support because he spent money extravagantly outside. He was helpless for a while and resorted to this tactic. The handling prosecutor, Li Mingshan, ordered him to be released on bail, but because his father had notified friends and relatives not to act as his son's guarantor, Jiang Xincheng could not find a guarantor and was taken back into custody by the bailiffs.

### Foreign Judge Sentences Too Lightly: Two Citizens Petition with Ten Thousand Words

[Our Newspaper Report] Regarding the foreign businessman "Foreign Tiger" Mesber, who illegally traded foreign exchange and foreign currency, since the district court sentenced him to one year of imprisonment and confiscated 40,000 US dollars and 20,000 Hong Kong dollars on the 14th of this month, there has been much discussion in the outside world. Some say that Judge Meng's sentencing was too lenient, some say that the measures prohibiting the circulation of foreign currency notes themselves have no legal effect, so there is no basis for sentencing, and some pay attention to why hundreds of thousands of US dollars were still returned to the original owner. In addition to the defendant himself and his defense counsel having filed appeals and independent appeals with the High Court, yesterday the District Prosecutor's Office received petitions from citizens Zhao Lixing and Chen Zongdao, residents of North Sichuan Road, believing that the district court's sentence on Mesber was too light and the confiscation was too small, requesting the prosecutor to appeal. The petition was more than ten feet long, with over ten thousand words, listing five reasons, the main content of which is: (1) The Foreign Tiger despises our country's laws, and now our country has joined the ranks of the five powers and cannot be humble. The sentence imposed on Mesber is only one-fifth of the maximum penalty for his crime, which is clearly inappropriate. (2) Operating telegraphic transfers and mail transfers, although not the buying and selling of foreign currency notes, foreign exchange cannot be separated from foreign currency and be independent, and the evils of telegraphic transfers and mail transfers are far greater than those of foreign currency. (3) More than 300,000 US dollars seized from Ebas Co. have not been disposed of or confiscated, which is very incomprehensible. (4) Ebas Co. has continuously engaged in criminal activities from February 18th to March 3rd, the date of the case's resolution, and lists figures on its daily accounts as proof. The petition states: Foreign currency and foreign exchange sold cannot be excused as unrecoverable and not be punished; the proceeds (legal tender) should be confiscated in full. (5) According to Ebas Co.'s accounts, it can be proven that its black market foreign exchange and foreign currency prices rose day by day, which was a planned manipulation. This petition will be reviewed by the original prosecutor in charge of the case, Quan Tao, and the identity and motives of the two named citizens, Zhao and Chen, may be investigated before a decision is made on whether to adopt it.

### Councilor He Inspects Various Banks; Some Suspected of Involvement in the Gold Rush

[Our Newspaper Report] It is reported that He Qishen, a councilor of the Ministry of Finance, and others were ordered to come to Shanghai to thoroughly investigate the gold rush, not limited to the case of suspected collusion and fraud between the Central Bank's Business Bureau and Zhan Liansheng. The inspection of the work of 44 banks in this city has been largely completed recently. According to Councilor He, some of the banks are indeed suspected of involvement in the gold rush. Another part of the banks' business is abnormal. As for the detailed situation, it is not yet time to publish it. In addition, the four banks of Dalu, Chuan Salt, Jin Cheng, and Zhen Ye were inspected directly by three commissioners, but Councilor He believed that their inspection reports were not detailed enough, so he personally went to review them again yesterday.

### Chairman Fang Arrives in Shanghai from Beijing; Still Hopes to Shed the Heavy Responsibility of Party Affairs in the Shortest Possible Time

Fang Zhi, the chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Party Department, previously requested resignation due to illness. After repeated efforts to persuade him to stay by President Chiang and urging from all sectors of the city, he has dismissed the idea of resigning and returned to Shanghai by train from Beijing yesterday morning at 8 o'clock with Secretary-General Xie Renzhao. After a short rest, Fang went to the Municipal Party Department to handle official business and then drove to the former residence of Deputy Dean Qin to offer condolences and comfort the family. A reporter from the Central News Agency visited yesterday, and he was pleased to make a statement, saying: "In the past five months, with the assistance of the heads of various agencies and leaders from all walks of life, the party affairs of this city have fortunately achieved a certain scale. However, due to my limited talent and heavy responsibilities, I am afraid that I will fail the central government's trust and the local expectations. Therefore, after attending the Third Plenary Session, I have submitted my resignation. Now, because of repeated encouragement from the President and urgent requests from leaders from all walks of life and comrades through letters and telegrams, I have to temporarily return to Shanghai to work. Fortunately, the National Government has been reorganized and democratic politics are making progress day by day. In the future, the promotion of party affairs will be more convenient. If we can get more participation and assistance from all parties, the progress can be expected. However, I still hope to shed the heavy responsibility of party affairs in this city in the shortest possible time." Fang continued, "Recently, prices in this city have risen again, which I am deeply concerned about. I hope that the entire city, from top to bottom, will cooperate and support the government in finding ways to stabilize prices, first by intensifying production and starting from stabilizing the lives of citizens, and then seeking the stability and construction of the entire Shanghai, which will be more convenient."

### Reporter Group Invited to See the Seawall; North Tang Public Surrounds, Raises Seven Demands; Head of Public Works Bureau Explains Allegations of Corruption Are Inaccurate

[Our Newspaper Report] The seawall of this city, starting from Wusong in the north and extending to Chuansha County in the south, is about fifteen li long. During the Anti-Japanese War, it was not maintained for years and was severely damaged. The Public Works Bureau started surveying, preparing budgets, and rushing to repair breaches in March of the 35th year of the Republic (1946), and has since completed the work one after another this year. Unexpectedly, the Municipal Council suddenly received a secret report from citizens of Gaoqiao, stating that the Public Works Bureau had engaged in dismantling and repairing the seawall, subcontracting, and other corrupt practices, which has already attracted the attention of people from all walks of life. In order to understand the actual situation, reporters in this city have requested the Public Works Bureau to disclose the truth. The Public Works Bureau sent personnel yesterday morning to accompany more than a dozen reporters from various newspapers in this city to conduct an on-site inspection of the Gaoqiao seawall.

The reporters first went to Nantang to visit. The breaches in the seawall there have all been completed. Many wooden piles have been driven into the beach, and the coast is blocked by a seawall made of rubble, with a concrete retaining wall built on top. Although the surface is simple, the project is quite large. The impact of the sea and the splashing waves are quite spectacular.

Strictly Punish the Foreman Who Stole Piles, Move Back the Dismantled Seawall Stones

When they arrived at Beitang, the vehicles carrying the reporters were suddenly surrounded by local residents. They, supporting the old and leading the young, held five-color banners with slogans, and seemed intent on making things difficult. After the reporters explained, they sent representatives to express their opinions. It was stated that a foreman, Yang Yilang, had stolen piles and used them to make buckets at No. 70, North Street, Gaoqiao, and should be severely punished. Seven demands were made: (1) Demand that the stones removed from the seawall be moved back to their original location for restoration to protect the lives and property of the local people. (2) Strictly investigate and punish the relevant personnel of the illegal and corrupt construction team. (3) Guarantee that similar incidents will not happen again in the future. (4) The restoration must be completed before the autumn floods. (5) When restoring the seawall to its original state, the Seawall Engineering Supervision Committee of the Taqu District People's Representative Assembly must be notified to send personnel to participate in the process, and it can only be considered satisfactory after they are satisfied. (6) Request that the officials write a written report on their inspection impressions to reassure the people. (7) Request that the press be the mouthpiece of the people and make a fair report to impose public opinion sanctions.

The So-Called Dismantling and Repairing of the Seawall is Due to Saving Expenses

The vehicles carrying the reporters were surrounded by the crowd for about fifteen minutes. Only after the reporters agreed to speak out on their behalf did they manage to break through the encirclement. Later, the head of the Public Works Bureau expressed his opinion on this issue, saying: The allegation of "huge corruption" cannot be established because the old stones moved from the old residential area of Xin'gang Biao Family No. 14 Gang to the Zhoujia浜 section of the seawall were due to saving expenses, and the Seawall Engineering Team never reported the account to the government for reimbursement. The implementation of this emergency seawall project has been discussed and designed by many experts. The public's so-called "dismantling and repairing the seawall" is actually due to a lack of understanding of the project. The loose stones scattered on the beach only resist one point of the sea's impact, while after being sorted and arranged to fill the breaches, their strength is increased to ten points. This not only avoids the consumption of expenses but also utilizes waste to the greatest extent. Moreover, this method of emergency seawall repair is not only starting in this city; the Jiangsu Provincial Government has long adopted the same method to repair the seawalls in Jiangnan.

Opinions Can Be Raised, But Avoid Acting Impulsively

The so-called "dismantling and repairing the seawall" was originally a temporary expedient measure because the government currently has no funds and must first rescue the autumn floods. In the future, a concrete retaining wall will still be built for permanent use. The funds currently approved by the Municipal Government are 1.2 billion yuan, and construction can begin as soon as they are allocated. The head of the Public Works Bureau also said: If local residents have opinions on the technology of the seawall project, they can provide them to the Public Works Bureau, but they must avoid acting impulsively. Regarding the foreman's corruption and other situations, it is hoped that they will report the facts so that the Public Works Bureau can thoroughly investigate and deal with them according to the law. The authorities have already begun a secret investigation into the case of foreman Yang Yilang's corruption as claimed by the residents.

We want teachers and students to work together and not be manipulated by bureaucrats." Dean Ji, the director of general affairs, reported that the school's finances were difficult, with a monthly shortfall of 70 million yuan, saying: "This kind of invisible blood-draining policy is worse than eating roots and leaves!"

### Tianjin and Beijing Will Experience a Textbook Shortage This Autumn

[Tianjin Shipping News] The Tianjin Education Bureau, following the order of the Ministry of Education, convened local publishers to discuss the issue of printing and selling nationally designated textbooks locally. The publishers raised issues such as the allocation ratio for each company, sales guarantees, paper foreign exchange, and printing loans. No results were reached in the discussion. Moreover, the copyright dispute over the nationally designated version has not been reasonably resolved according to law. According to the order of the Ministry of Education, those who reprint before the end of June will still be strictly investigated. According to the Copyright Law and the Civil Law, the copyright issue cannot be directly interpreted or confiscated by the education administrative authorities. No matter when they reprint and sell, it is still a criminal act. Therefore, local publishers have sent letters to their counterparts in Shanghai to inquire about the details and temporarily adopt a wait-and-see attitude. In Beijing, the Municipal Education Bureau also convened publishers to discuss, but there were no significant results. As for the powerful Commercial Press, Zhengzhong, Zhonghua, and other companies, they have reached the expiration of their agreements with the Ministry of Education, and they have no absolute obligation to supply them, so their attitude is quite cold. It is expected that this autumn, the Tianjin and Beijing areas will experience an extreme textbook shortage. City Women's Association Scheduled to Hold

Letter of Correction: Yesterday, I read in your newspaper a piece of news about our school being repeatedly banned by the Ministry of Education, which is slightly different from the actual situation. According to the Ministry of Education, the fact that the Ministry of Education ordered the school to suspend operations because it was not running in accordance with regulations was temporarily resolved by the National Pharmaceutical Industry Association and others on March 17, when representatives were elected to go to Beijing to petition. As a result, officials from various agencies received them and agreed to temporarily allow the school to continue operating on a trial basis, waiting for the Wang authorities to instruct them on improving the direction. Therefore, our school is still adhering to its original intention and continuing classes as usual. The sections reported yesterday were rumors and inaccurate. Please give a correction.

At the start, the Giants used Pi Gu-nai as the main center, with the rest of the lineup remaining unchanged, and Gu Fo-lie as a substitute. After a chaotic start, the score was tied at 6-6. The tall Gu Fo-lie replaced Tao Bo-lin-ji, and the Giants formed an all-tall lineup, but still did not gain an advantage. Wah Luen's well-coordinated passing was seamless, which was the main reason for their victory. The two teams were evenly matched under the basket, with the Giants relying on their height, while Wah Luen relied on the efforts of A-di and Da Li for support. The Giants frequently made substitutions, while Wah Luen fought to the end with five players.

Wah Luen led all the way after 4-3. In the second half, the Giants once narrowed the gap to 24-25, thanks to Lao Bao's successful attack under the basket, which stabilized the team's morale. At this time, the Giants made a mistake by replacing Gu Fo-lie with the short Tao, which allowed A-di to score two consecutive goals, sealing the victory.

Fu Ni-shi was steady, and Pi Gu-nai's shooting was unconventional, making them the Giants' two most outstanding players. Gu Fo-lie was restrained by Da Li and faded into obscurity.

In recent games, Lao Bao has been relied upon as the main scorer, and his play under the basket and free throws have been reliable and pleasing. In the all-tall lineup, A-di was still the most active player, while Jin Xue-chong was slightly out of form last night. (Chang Nian)

### National Bank to Issue 10,000 Yuan Notes to Adapt to Needs and Facilitate Payments; Limited Number of Large Denomination Notes in Shanghai Can Only Be Dispatched by Air

[Our Reporter] It is reported that the Central Bank, in response to the request of the Federation of National Banking Associations and to meet social needs, has issued a notice to all banks, money shops, financial institutions, and branches across the country to issue 10,000 yuan national currency notes. The full text of the notice is as follows: "At this National Banking Association Federation meeting in Beijing, based on the opinions of representatives from various regions, and in order to facilitate overseas remittances, promote production, invigorate capital, and facilitate collection and payment, a request was made to issue 10,000 yuan notes. In order to adapt to the above needs, this bank intends to issue them gradually, taking into consideration the situation in various regions. These 10,000 yuan national currency notes are printed by the Central Printing Plant and the China Book Company. Apart from the sample notes, which will be sent separately by letter, this is hereby notified for your information."

It is also learned that Guangzhou, Xi'an, and other places are in urgent need of 10,000 yuan notes due to the influx of overseas remittances and the need to collect cotton. The National Bank has been gradually shipping them for issuance and use. In Shanghai, the current number of large denomination notes is limited, and if needed, only a small number can be dispatched by air.

[Another Dispatch] Tian Fu-jin, Deputy Director of the Issuance Bureau of the Central Bank, commented on the issue of issuing large denomination notes and the price issue. According to Tian, increasing the face value of the notes is by no means equivalent to increasing the amount of currency in circulation. Conversely, not issuing large denomination notes is not proof that the amount of currency is not increasing. Since the issuance of the 500 yuan Customs Gold Unit, 10,000 yuan notes have already been related to the market. Moreover, the issuance of 10,000 yuan notes this time is entirely to meet market needs, so it will not affect prices.

### Commander Xuan Orders Strict Investigation and Prevention; Speculators Confuse the Public with Rumors

Regarding the Central Bank's upcoming issuance of 10,000 yuan notes, Garrison Commander Xuan Tie-wu ordered his subordinates to pay close attention to investigating and preventing speculators from taking the opportunity to confuse the public with rumors. The original order stated: "The reason for the Central Bank's imminent issuance of 10,000 yuan banknotes is the shortage of funds in the interior, leading to competition for remittances to Shanghai, which has caused exchange rates to rise. Shanghai banks and money shops have requested the issuance for convenience of collection and settlement, and the Central Bank has given it serious consideration. It is believed that the 10,000 yuan banknote is equivalent to the 500 yuan Customs Gold Unit that has already been issued, and the issuance this time is entirely for convenience of collection and settlement, which should not affect price fluctuations. It is feared that speculators will take the opportunity to confuse the public with rumors. Please pay close attention to investigation and prevention."

### Fangjian Sells Cotton Yarn; Cannot Interfere with Foreign Sales

[Our Reporter] It was rumored that China Fangjian Company had stopped distributing cotton yarn to the Northeast and North China. The reporter inquired with a person in charge of the company, who firmly denied this statement. He said: "After Fangjian Company sells yarn, it cannot interfere with whether the yarn holders sell it to other ports." However, the company is aware that the black market for cotton yarn has been rampant in recent days. In addition to temporarily suspending distribution to factory numbers that have not been able to provide business registration certificates before April 20, the existing old distribution accounts will also be gradually reorganized. The qualifications of each factory number will be strictly reviewed again. Those who do not meet the standards will be gradually eliminated.

### Public Confidence Firm, Appetite Strong; All Food Prices Rise; Oil Prices Jump Madly, Fluctuating Most

[Our Reporter] Yesterday, a total of more than 9,100 shi of registered rice and grain arrived in the northern and southern markets. The Social Affairs Bureau continued to release 9,000 bags of white japonica, Saigon, and red xian rice, and the prices remained unchanged. However, the market's appetite suddenly strengthened, and demand exceeded supply. Xian yuan was consistently up 3,000 to 5,000 yuan, and miscellaneous grains also rose successively. This is because the prices of various commodities outside the market have risen sharply, and public sentiment is high, leading to rising prices.

Flour also sold briskly, rising 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. Bran added more than 20 yuan, and soybean cake sales were also quite lively, rising 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Soybean oil factories had strong demand, jumping madly by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan. The oil market also digested well, and the market was brisk, soaring fiercely by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan, with large fluctuations.

Raw peanuts were readily accepted by Guangbang, and fluctuations were drastic, rising madly by 20,000 yuan. Sesame owners were also firm, and although foreign firms did not move, local oil factories eagerly bought.

### Export of Oil Extraction Raw Materials Requires Verification of Permits

[Our Reporter] Yesterday, the Jianghai Customs announced that the export of soybeans, peanuts, sesame, rapeseed, and their extracted oils abroad should be verified by merchants with permits before being allowed to leave the country. The announcement stated: "According to the telegram from the Director-General of Customs, and the order from the Ministry of Finance, as resolved by the Executive Yuan, in order to balance supply and demand and stabilize oil prices, a quantitative licensing system will be adopted for the export of soybeans, peanuts, sesame, rapeseed, and their extracted oils abroad. The amount of each quarter's exports abroad will be determined and implemented by the Ministry of Finance in consultation with the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Export Promotion Committee. In accordance with the instructions to transfer to all customs, for the export of soybeans, peanuts, sesame, rapeseed, and their extracted oils abroad, merchants should verify with permits before being allowed to leave the country."

Also, last Friday, the Jianghai Customs notified all customs brokers that the export of food grains was prohibited, causing panic among Nanyang and grain merchants. According to news from the shipping industry yesterday, the Jianghai Customs has formally announced that the ban on the export of miscellaneous grains will be enforced as usual for domestic ports, but all exports abroad are prohibited, including Hong Kong. increased by 10,000 yuan. Red beans, with active sales in South China, continued to rise by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan. Red sorghum was scarce and firm, and corn prices fluctuated. Green beans in Hong Kong and Guangzhou were unchanged, and the situation tended to stabilize.

Rising Yarn Prices Stimulate Rice Prices

[Our Reporter] Yesterday, the rice market saw fluctuations again, with the quantity and price of rice sold by the Social Affairs Bureau remaining the same. It is learned that the source of rice in the market is relatively small, and the price of rice in Wuxi has risen back to 155,000 yuan. Yesterday, the market price of rice in this city was 165,000 yuan, and the retail price reached 175,000 yuan. The price of vegetable oil rose back to 450,000 yuan, and the price of flour; Libang distribution was 70,000 yuan, and the black market reached 99,000 yuan. Navy distribution was 47,000 yuan, and the black market price was 68,000 yuan. According to relevant sources, the recent rise in rice prices is related to the issuance of large denomination notes, and the rise in stock and yarn prices has stimulated the rise in general commodity prices. Yesterday, due to the influence of the National Bank's upcoming issuance of 10,000 yuan notes, some rice merchants clearly intended to raise prices. White japonica and foreign xian rice both rose back, and today the department in charge of the Social Affairs Bureau decided to send personnel to supervise the northern and southern markets, and Section Chief Ji will personally inspect them.

### Increase Cotton Yarn Production; Develop Overseas Markets

[Our Reporter] Rong Hong-yuan, General Manager of Shenxin Textile Corporation, told reporters yesterday that in order to increase cotton yarn production and develop China's overseas cotton yarn market, he advocated: (1) Extending the current 10-hour shift system to 11 hours, so that the day and night shifts can operate for 22 hours, and cotton yarn production can be increased accordingly. He said: "Previously, each shift was 12 hours, so the day and night shifts operated for 24 hours completely. Therefore, in terms of the current operating time, production has already been discounted by 80%." (2) Hoping that the government can consider allowing some cotton yarn to be exported, so as to establish China's market overseas. Japan plans to provide 40% of its cotton yarn products for export this year. Therefore, if China's cotton yarn cannot be exported in time, the original market will be seized by Japanese yarn. Moreover, after the export of cotton yarn, it can also earn a sum of foreign exchange for the country, which will also make a considerable contribution to balancing China's international balance of payments.

### Ministry of Finance Orders Local Banks and Shops

Inter-Dealer Transactions Also Prohibited

In order to prevent domestic funds from escaping to Hong Kong, the Ministry of Finance previously stipulated that travelers from mainland China to Hong Kong or other regions should not carry more than 500,000 yuan of national currency. In order to strictly control this, the Ministry of Finance now stipulates that all banks and money shops across the country should stop handling remittances of national currency to Hong Kong from today. Before approval to resume, all banks and shops across the country must not handle remittances of national currency to Hong Kong. In addition, local banks and shops that accept entrustments from counterparts in Hong Kong and Macau to handle collection and payment business should also be prohibited. After receiving the order, the Central Bank has notified all banks and shops to follow suit.

### Edible Oil Rises Due to Raw Materials

Since the resumption of distribution in the edible oil market in this city last week, the market price has fallen to below 410,000 yuan, only a few thousand yuan above or below the temporary price of 400,000 yuan stipulated by the city government. In recent days, it has risen again to between 440,000 and 450,000 yuan. The reason for this is still the raw material problem, which has not been reasonably resolved. The government allows the supply of 15,000 tons of soybeans per month, but due to transportation reasons, it cannot solve the urgent need. Currently, each manufacturer relies only on the 4,000 tons of soybeans from the previous CITIC Bureau to maintain the current situation. They are also actively purchasing raw materials and edible oil to supply the market, and hope that the government will expedite assistance. Qingdao oil has risen to 410,000 yuan, which is also the reason for the black market increase compared to the limited price here. Regarding the issue of adjusting the distribution mechanism, the Oil Extraction Industry Association is studying the method and will submit it to the meeting convened by the Social Affairs Bureau for decision.

### Shortage of Raw Materials and Difficulty in Foreign Exchange Settlement Lead to Sharp Decline in Soap and Candle Production

[Our Reporter] According to a survey by the Industrial and Commercial Guidance Office, there are a total of 41 members in the Soap and Candle Industry Association of this city. The highest monthly output is 150,000 boxes of laundry soap (47 pounds per box), 30,000 boxes of scented soap (30 pounds per box), 50,000 pounds of glycerin (calculated based on the recovery of glycerin from 100,000 boxes of soap produced each month), and candles have not been manufactured recently. Currently, due to high wages, pressure from usury, heavy taxes, and fierce dumping by foreign merchants in China, coupled with difficulties in importing raw materials and settling foreign exchange, the actual output of each factory is only half of the highest output. If calculated based on the monthly production of 150,000 boxes of laundry soap, then the soap factories in this city need the following raw materials each month: 40,000 piculs of half-oil, 2,000 barrels of bubble alkali (750 pounds per barrel), 1,000 barrels of caustic soda (300 kilograms per barrel), 3,000 piculs of industrial salt, pure alkali (can be omitted if there is caustic soda), 800 tons of coal dust, 10,000 piculs of coconut oil, and 1,100 tons of diesel. Of the above raw materials, caustic soda and coconut oil rely on imports. Although domestic production of caustic soda is slightly available, its output is insufficient, and the export of foreign caustic soda is restricted by the government, and cannot be sold freely, so importers take the opportunity to raise prices, and the highest price per barrel has reached more than 6 million yuan. However, the foreign Xiangmao Soap Factory has easier foreign exchange settlement and lower costs, and domestic soap merchants cannot compete with it. Therefore, the industry hopes that the government will provide a thorough solution to help the industry turn from danger to safety. Dahua Bubble Alkali has sufficient output to meet the needs of this city, but its business is greatly affected due to the dumping of American goods. The industry currently faces two difficulties: (1) Purchase of caustic soda: According to the Industry Association, "If the purchase of caustic soda is difficult, it is proposed that the government try to request Yongli Alkali Factory to supply pure alkali to replace caustic soda. And please ask the Taiwan Administrative Governor's Office's Industrial and Mining Office to provide caustic soda as much as possible to solve the immediate urgent need." (2) Purchase of coconut oil: Coconut oil relies on supply from Southeast Asia, and the industry hopes that the government will allow the settlement of foreign exchange for coconuts to facilitate the production of coconut oil.

### Silk Falls Back

Yesterday, the artificial silk market was still active and rising in the morning. In the afternoon, rumors of profit-taking entered the market, and many parties took advantage of the high prices to cash out, so it showed a decline. As a result, it leveled with the previous day's price. No. 120 Takayama Yuko opened at 2.8 million yuan, and then shouted up to 3.2 million yuan, with a maximum price of 500,000 yuan, but the buyers stepped back due to the high price, so it still closed at 3 million yuan. In the afternoon, due to rumors of loans and falling stocks, public confidence gradually weakened, and there were only sellers and no buyers, and finally it closed at 2.5 million yuan. The factory sentiment was quite strong in the morning, with D-grade trading at 4 million yuan, and ordinary high-end goods were also priced at 14 million yuan, and dried silk was priced at 10 million yuan, and a single was traded for 1.1 million yuan. In the afternoon, due to the decline in artificial silk, it also softened, and the asking prices for each grade were 200,000 to 300,000 yuan lower. Silk goods have been rising for several days in a row. Yesterday, in addition to Dachen checkered crepe opening at 25,200 yuan in the morning and closing at 5,600 yuan, which was 600 yuan higher than the previous day, the rest were firm and stable with little progress.

### Only Printed Fabrics are Traded in the Cotton Cloth Market

Although there were transactions in the cotton cloth market yesterday, they were mostly various printed fabrics, because these goods are not within the price limit, and do not conflict with the types stipulated by the economic inspection regulations, so the association allows members to trade on the market. As for various popular goods, such as Longtou fine cloth and Sijunzi serge, the cost of cotton cloth has been stimulated by the soaring black market yarn prices in recent days, and public confidence is strong, and the transaction prices have far exceeded the legal limit. In order to comply with the authorities' intention of stable prices, the association does not allow such illegal transactions in the market. However, according to Yin Xin-yuan, the secretary of the association, "In recent days, the black market price of cotton yarn has soared, and popular fabrics are all processed and copied with 20-count yarn as raw materials. One pound of yarn is woven into one pound of cloth, plus processing, copying, and other labor costs. According to the recent black market yarn prices, the cost of cotton cloth has actually exceeded the legal limit. The association plans to convene a meeting of members to discuss follow-up measures."

### Stabilize Pork Prices; Find Ways to Provide Loans

Social Affairs Bureau Convenes Representatives for Talks

[Our Reporter] The Social Affairs Bureau convened representatives of the pork industry, pig industry, and beef and mutton industry at 3:00 pm yesterday to hold a Fresh Meat Price Evaluation and Limit Committee meeting. The main points of the discussion were: (1) In order to stabilize pork prices, low-interest loans can be provided, and the scope should be universal in principle. (2) The Pork Industry Association and the Fresh Meat Industry Association should prepare a loan plan within five days for review and transfer to financial institutions. (3) After the loan is established, all procurement and distribution information, as well as the agreed prices, should be reported to the competent authorities for verification at any time.

### Anthracite Fine Falls Back

Anthracite fines initially followed the previous day's rise, and the market prices continued to rise. Kaiping No. 1 fines once reached the 1 million yuan mark. Because the asking price was too high, sellers appeared, and buyers took a wait-and-see attitude. The market suddenly became sluggish, and the market price quickly fell back. However, the result was still higher than the previous market. White coal arrivals were very small, and market prices continued to rise. Jiaozuo lump coal reached a new price of 1.75 million yuan, and Jiangxi Sifangzi white coal, Shantou Meiyuan white coal, etc. also required 1.45 million to 1.5 million yuan. Coke also increased due to the soaring price of anthracite fines, affecting the market situation, and was consistently outstanding.

### Large Batch of Tea Shipped to Europe

[Our Reporter] The Danish Rinnesmack, chartered by the French postal ship company, left Shanghai for France yesterday afternoon. In addition to the original 8,000 tons of soybeans loaded from Qinhuangdao to Shanghai, it also loaded more than 10,300 boxes of tea for shipment to France.

### Domestic Sales Sluggish

Various domestic sales teas, which have been hovering for a long time, have gradually sparked the idea of ​​raising prices, but in the end, because actual sales are not strong, the market is still difficult to rise, and the result continues to present a fluctuating situation. The source of Hangzhou New Longjing has been continuous recently, but the quality is getting older, causing the industry to mutually price, tending to the downstream, but public confidence is not discouraged, and the process is clearly falling and secretly stabilizing. Foreign firm tea market: Yutai continues to extract Fuliang black tea from last year, and other varieties are only sporadically opening, and the situation is extremely flat and weak.

### Only Printed Cloth is Traded in the Cotton Cloth Market

### Import Volume is Low, Demand is Urgent: White Paper Prices Repeatedly Rise; Guangzhou Also Purchases from Shanghai

[Report from our newspaper] According to industry insiders, the recent increase in white paper prices is due to: (1) insufficient import quotas; (2) urgent demand from other areas; and (3) high black market exchange rates for US dollars. Therefore, prices have risen again recently. Roll white paper has reached a price of 3,000 yuan per pound. Cut white paper has reached 155,000 yuan per ream.

The import quota for white paper from February to April this year, after allocating US$720,000 to the newspaper industry and US$642,000 to the publishing industry, leaves a remaining quota of US$220,000, which is divided among eighteen paper importing firms. The largest receives over 70,000 yuan, and the smallest receives 5,000 yuan. Additionally, there is a quota of US$364,000 for other types of paper, which is distributed among seventy-four importing firms. The largest receives 40,000 yuan, and the smallest receives only 1,000 yuan, highlighting the small size of the allocated quotas. As for purchases from other areas, the northern regions still account for the largest share. However, it is reported that the Guangzhou Transportation Control Commission has recently tightened the issuance of permits, so those in Hankou and along the Yuehan Railway, who previously obtained their paper supplies from Hong Kong, will also shift their purchases to Shanghai.

### A Women's Army is Being Trained: The New Glory of Shandong Women's Movement

— Jinan, 16th (Airmail Dispatch) — Special Correspondent Li Tian of this Newspaper

Since the victory, more than eight-tenths of Shandong's territory has remained under the "liberation" of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), and the remaining areas have been subjected to the "hard fight, soft eat" tactics of the Communist army. It is not difficult to see the hardship of those in charge of the Shandong situation.

Addressing the severe situation in Shandong is not only the responsibility of the government and the men of Shandong. The women of Qi (ancient name for Shandong) are unwilling to lag behind. Under the advocacy and efforts of Yang Baolin, Hu Yichen, and others from the Shandong Women's Movement Association, the saying "Everyone is responsible for the fate of the nation, and every woman is also responsible" has achieved glorious results, washing away the historically attached shame of "singing girls not knowing the sorrow of national subjugation." This is a pioneering initiative in the history of the Chinese women's movement. What women workers throughout the country's provinces and cities should learn from is the Shandong Women's Movement Association's training of Shandong women.

Shandong Women's Movement Association Unwilling to Lag Behind

Around this time last year, Shandong was affected by the truce agreement, and government troops were strictly prohibited from moving north. The National Army's forces in Jinan were so thin that it was unimaginable. Wang Yaowu recognized the importance of the people's self-defense forces and organized the People's Self-Defense Headquarters, first training 267,973 people in the provincial capital within three months. The Shandong Women's Movement Association, unwilling to lag behind, actively cooperated with the People's Self-Defense Headquarters to establish a women's group, training 33,000 women soldiers.

The training method involved organizing women in the provincial capital, aged between eighteen and thirty-five, into teams for training. Ordinary women, including female shop assistants, female barbers, and female waitresses, were organized into detachments, brigades, and companies based on their districts and neighborhoods. As for female opera singers, prostitutes, and others, they were organized into direct-affiliated brigades by the headquarters for training. Female factory workers, female clerks, and female public school teachers and female students from various agencies and schools were self-organized and trained by their original agencies and schools, with personnel assigned by the women's group of the headquarters to guide and coach. The training subjects included not only military subjects but also emphasized political training and covered nursing, first aid, childcare, sewing, cleaning, investigation, organization, training, and propaganda. To reduce practical difficulties during training, the following were exempted from training: (1) those with children under three years old who have no one else to care for them; (2) those who are sick or have bound feet and difficulty moving; (3) pregnant women who are five months or more along; and (4) housewives who are solely responsible for their families and cannot leave home.

Grand Procession, Spirits Soaring

Before the general women's training, to facilitate the smooth progress of the training, 537 women with junior high school or normal school education or above were first selected from the reported trainees for short-term cadre training. These cadres were then assigned to various districts and neighborhoods to conduct general village women's training. During the training period, although some city residents opposed women's training due to backward thinking, and the Communist Party took the opportunity to spread rumors, claiming that "women's training is to prepare for the comfort of soldiers," a small number of women inevitably fled and waited to see. However, the vast majority of women actively participated, humbly receiving instruction, and requested to participate in investigation, propaganda, comfort, and other work after training. After ten days of training, during the review held at the provincial stadium outside Nanwei Gate, the 36,000 neatly marching, energetic women soldiers formed a grand procession, which not only shone brightly in the national women's movement but also, in the overall people's self-defense training in the province, achieved outstanding results worthy of recognition. When the brigade passed in front of the reviewing stand, Director of Education Yang Baolin led the shout "Long Live Women's Liberation," and 36,000 people responded in unison, shaking the Lu River, even the famous Thousand Buddha Mountain on the outskirts of Jinan seemed to echo in response.

The review results showed that the factories, schools, and railway bureau achieved the best results, while the performance of government officials was the worst. Surprisingly, the performance of the prostitute brigade ranked second overall, which deserves attention. According to investigations, this was because they were the most obedient and had the greatest ambition, which is why they were able to achieve such high results.

This women's training organization is still maintained and has further divided the original eleven detachments and nine directly affiliated brigades into five specialized groups for propaganda, organization, training, investigation, first aid, and comfort, convening and training personnel twice each. At the spring grand exercises held some time ago, these middle-aged women showed significant progress compared to their training last year. Undoubtedly, their growth has brought considerable and indelible stability to the overall situation in Shandong, which has been plagued by constant rain and especially to the once isolated city of Jinan.

In addition to this, the Shandong Women's Movement Association has two other great achievements: (1) the establishment of the Shandong Martyrs' Dependents School, which has recently accommodated more than 600 children of martyrs who died in the War of Resistance, divided into six elementary school classes and five junior and senior high school classes. All student accommodation, clothing, books, and other expenses are borne by the school. (2) The promotion of comfort work: During the emergency in Jinan at the beginning of last month, it completed a fundraising campaign of 1 billion yuan and 200,000 pairs of shoes and socks within half a month.

Other activities such as women's literacy classes, women's clinics, women's cooperatives, women's welfare service agencies, Zuomin nurseries, Siyuan kindergartens, as well as relief for all oppressed women and mediation of oppressed women and their family disputes are all unfolding vigorously and have achieved significant results worthy of observation and imitation. In Shandong, as of now, can you find any social group that is more active than the Women's Movement Association? Which has shown more performance in its work? Undoubtedly, Shandong women are not only burying themselves in action to fight for their own liberation but are also acting to benefit the country and its people.

### New German Invention: Bitter Chestnuts Save from Hardship; Streets Full of Money Trees, Ensuring Food, Clothing, and Warmth

— 6th (Airmail Dispatch) — Special Correspondent Wang Ren, Writing from Leiden

Germany experienced a long and severe winter last year, suffering from hunger and cold to the extreme. German scholars, relying on the power of science, turned waste into treasure and skillfully seized nature's secrets, opening up a wonderful solution: the latest invention of "bitter chestnuts saving from hardship."

The method involves obtaining raw materials from the bitter chestnuts that are discarded and useless throughout the streets in autumn, the spherical cupules covered in prickles, to enrich people's livelihoods. Not only can they be eaten, but they can also be worn. A kind of street decoration tree used to show off appearance has suddenly transformed into a money tree that provides both clothing and food.

The chestnut is a deciduous tree that grows wild in the mountains, reaching over five zhang (approx. 16 meters) in height. The leaves are alternately arranged, sharp and long like lance leaves, with sharp serrated edges. In Western Europe, male and female flowers bloom in May. Male flowers are arranged in long spikes, while female flowers often grow in clusters of three. The flower color is nearly white, with red ones being particularly beautiful. When the flowers bloom, they are supported by leaves, resembling thousands of red candles from a distance. A courtyard in a valley, mountain market town can represent the beauty of spring in Germany, no less than the peach blossoms of China or the cherry blossoms of Japan.

The chestnuts on the European continent are divided into two types: sweet and bitter. The sweet ones are known as Sweet Chestnut in English and Marron in French. The Guihua (sweet osmanthus) chestnut of West Lake in China is a delicacy, which is a sweet chestnut. Honey-glazed sweet chestnuts from southern France are world-renowned; we in China can imitate this practice. The bitter ones are simply called Chestnut in Latin, English, and French. Bitter chestnuts are inedible or used to feed horses. They should be called "bitter chestnuts" in Chinese to distinguish them from sweet chestnuts.

On my thirty-sixth birthday, I went on a spring outing with companions, and I composed a poem inspired by the scenery, which deeply reflects the joy of spring in Germany. I transcribe it below: "Singing and playing music, we hurry along, a small group of birds face the wind. (In German, 'birds' refers to boy and girl scouts who are skilled at singing. The fairy music drifts in the wind; don't waste the spring, youth is enchanting). The wild shop is full of people drinking coffee, chestnut flowers red in the green courtyard." (This chestnut is the bitter chestnut).

Now, German scholars have discovered that the nutrients contained in "bitter chestnuts" are even more abundant than those in soybean foods, which are vigorously advocated by my Chinese scientific leader Li Gaoyang (Shi Zeng): (1) Dried chestnuts can be ground into flour, removing the bitterness to produce high-quality white flour. (2) A milk substitute can be made, comparable to Chinese tofu juice. Most beautifully, bitterness can be removed from bitter chestnuts to make ice cream. (3) Artificial wool made from bitter chestnuts can keep out the cold. (4) A holy medicine for treating intestinal diseases can be extracted.

Spring and Autumn

### Shakespeare in England

— Cao Weifeng

Although Shakespeare was English, in literature, especially in drama, he already belongs to all of humanity. Great artists are always like this because the subjects they deal with are not people of a specific country or era but the entirety of humanity, the essence of human nature; they not only transcend space but also transcend time. During this great war, Shakespeare's plays were heavily performed in the United States. Not only that, but military theater troupes at the front lines also had several Shakespearean productions. The performance of black democratic actor Robeson in war relief performances was extremely fitting.

The Soviet Union's enthusiasm for Shakespeare is unmatched by any other country. Theaters throughout the Soviet Union stage Shakespeare's works on a large scale every spring. According to the sales of translations, at least millions of Soviet people have seen Shakespeare's works. This is not only because the Soviet people respect Shakespeare but also enough to prove the cultivation of their people's literature and art.

We have long been accustomed to hearing and reading words and texts praising Shakespeare. His aphorisms, the archetypes he created, have been constantly quoted for centuries. I have always advocated adopting a critical attitude towards Shakespeare's evaluation, but because his works are numerous, the range he deals with is wide, and the texts discussing his work can truly fill volumes, although I have been engaged in translating his works for fifteen or sixteen years, I have never dared to start writing criticisms of him.

In England today, Shakespearean studies are also regarded by scholars as a daunting task. Although there are not few people researching, and even during the war, several specialized books are published every year, scholars who can achieve great success and works of profound depth have not been seen for more than a decade.

However, the British have not forgotten Shakespeare. London stages repeat performances of Shakespeare's plays every year. In addition, there is a grand performance of Shakespeare's works at the memorial theater in Shakespeare's hometown around Shakespeare's birthday every year. This year, April 23rd is the 383rd anniversary of Shakespeare's birth and the 331st anniversary of his death. At this time in England, on the banks of the Avon River, in Shakespeare's hometown town, it must be extraordinarily lively.

I have a program leaflet from the 1938 Shakespeare festival. The scale of that drama festival can be considered quite large. It started on April 3rd and ended on September 23rd. During this period, Shakespeare's works were performed for a full twenty-five weeks. For people who study Shakespeare, attending such a drama festival once can be very beneficial. Although I was in England that year, I couldn't afford to see a play, and I still regret it every time I think about it.

That performance was divided into two parts, the first part lasted twelve weeks and performed eight plays in total:

1. As You Like It 13 times

2. Twelfth Night 12 times

3. Othello 14 times

4. The Taming of the Shrew 13 times

5. Richard III 13 times

6. The Comedy of Errors 11 times

7. Much Ado About Nothing 11 times

8. Coriolanus 9 times

There were a total of ninety-six performances, six days a week—no performances on Sundays—averaging eight performances per week. The second part of the program also included eight plays, including "The Merchant of Venice" and "Hamlet." There are several famous actors in England who specialize in performing Shakespeare's plays. They live near the town of Stratford and only participate in performances during this festival every year.

These audiences can be said to come from all over the world. British audiences, apart from students, do not occupy an important position. In the town of Stratford, the Shakespeare Memorial Theater is the center of the entire town. Foreigners who come to visit and people who admire Shakespeare flock there year-round. During the theater festival, there are even more tourists. Railway companies add special trains, and long-distance buses increase their schedules, all for the sake of watching Shakespeare's plays.

Shakespeare wrote a total of thirty-seven plays in his lifetime, as well as a book of sonnets and several long poems. Among these thirty-seven plays, several are extremely difficult to perform. For example, "King Lear" is a very difficult play to perform, and it is usually only staged once every two or three years. In terms of comedy, "The Tempest" is also rarely performed.

Even so, some of his other plays are not only often performed but also enthusiastically appreciated by audiences, day after day for centuries. "As You Like It," "The Merchant of Venice," "Hamlet," "A Midsummer Night's Dream," "Othello," and "Romeo and Juliet" are all plays that are revived on European and American stages every year.

Among English-speaking nations, Shakespeare's works are also regarded as a kind of test for actors. It goes without saying that their schoolchildren must read some Shakespeare because he is the best author. In addition, if their young people want to pursue acting, playing a role in Shakespeare's works is a necessary stage. There are several characters in Shakespeare's plays, male characters such as the Jewish character Shylock in "The Merchant of Venice," Richard III, Romeo, and Hamlet; female characters such as Juliet, Lady Macbeth, and Rosaline in "As You Like It," all are characters that a successful actor must portray.

I don't know when I will be able to introduce Shakespeare's true face to the Chinese stage and show it to Chinese audiences. Adaptation is by no means the right path; learning from films produced by Hollywood is also not a solution. I have seen several Shakespearean films from Hollywood: "Romeo and Juliet," "As You Like It," "A Midsummer Night's Dream," "The Taming of the Shrew," and "Henry V." Only "Henry V" is somewhat better; the others are too Americanized. Unfortunately, Chinese people don't easily appreciate the play "Henry V."

I believe that Shakespeare's plays have the potential to succeed when performed in China. My translation is for students to read. If it is for performance, it can be changed into colloquial language. I hope that the domestic situation can stabilize and literary activities can become lively again. That way, we might also be able to introduce Shakespeare once and perform "Hamlet."

### Shakespeare

— Jia Hua

Shakespeare is the world's greatest playwright. Although he was a figure of the Elizabethan era in the sixteenth century, because he left us many glorious masterpieces, even though more than three hundred years have passed, he remains a bright bud in the history of world literature.

Literary critic Soroli哀 said, "As soon as we hear Shakespeare, we already get a grand concept" (Comparative Literary History). Professor Wilson Knight also praised, "William Shakespeare is indeed the greatest writer in the history of world literature."

### Shakespeare's Portrait

— British M. Droeshout

### Shakespeare's Works

— Feng Li

Shakespeare wrote thirty-six plays. At the time, his plays were not printed for readers to read; they were only performed on stage. When Shakespeare died, drafts of twenty-one plays were found in various theaters. Others were printed as quarto books, which were printed with Shakespeare's permission. Most of the plays were recorded by listeners in the theater, and some publishers secretly printed them for their own benefit. The first collection of Shakespeare's plays was called the First Folio, which was edited by two actors, Heming and Condell.

Shakespeare's plays can be divided into five periods based on the progress of his life and experience.

(1) Early Experimental Period

The early works express youth and imagination.

Shakespeare began his writing by imitating old plays and writing "Henry VI." After that, he imitated Marlowe's style and wrote "Titus Andronicus," imitating "Love's Labour's Lost." Imitating the Latin comedy "Menaechmi" by Plantus (Mantus), he wrote "The Comedy of Errors." The representative works of Shakespeare's first period are "Two Gentlemen of Verona," "A Midsummer Night's Dream," and "Romeo and Juliet." In these plays, we see Shakespeare's writing making rapid progress.

(2) English Historical Play Period

After the age of thirty, Shakespeare began to write historical plays: "Richard III," "Richard II," "King John," "Henry IV," and "Henry V." The historical materials and anecdotes in these plays are mostly taken from Holinshed's "Chronicles of England, Scotland, and Ireland." During this period, Shakespeare also produced some comedic reliefs, such as "Falstaff."

(3) "The Merchant of Venice" and the Merry Comedy Period

The plays of this period are: "The Taming of the Shrew," "The Merry Wives of Windsor," "The Merchant of Venice," and "As You Like It." After finishing "The Merchant of Venice," Shakespeare changed his style, and his works became serious and melancholy. "Twelfth Night" is the last of Shakespeare's comedies. Shakespeare wrote sonnets. His sonnets were published in 1609.

(4) Melancholy Period

Shakespeare wrote Roman plays: "Julius Caesar," "Coriolanus," and "Antony and Cleopatra." After completing the Roman plays, Shakespeare began to write comedies again, but he wrote bitter comedies, such as "Measure for Measure" and "Troilus and Cressida." Later, Shakespeare wrote four great tragedies: "Hamlet," "Othello," "Macbeth," and "King Lear." The last tragedy was "Timon of Athens." After that, Shakespeare no longer wrote tragedies.

(5) Pure Romantic Period

The plays of this period are full of mysterious and composed spirits, expressing Shakespeare's late literary works. "Cymbeline," "The Winter's Tale," and "The Tempest" are his best plays of his later years. "The Tempest" was written for the wedding of Princess Elizabeth and the Prince Palatine in 1613. "The Tempest" shows Shakespeare's new character. The charm of "A Midsummer Night's Dream," the passion of "Romeo and Juliet," the humor of "Falstaff," and the heroism of "King Lear" are all gathered in "The Tempest," which is Shakespeare's last artistic work.

### Shakespeare Sonnet 109

— Translated by Zhen Qin

O, never say that I was false of heart,
Though absence seemed my flame to qualify.
As easy might I from myself depart
As from my soul which in thy breast doth lie.
That is my home of love: if I have ranged,
Like him that travels I return again;
Just to the time, not with the time exchanged, --
So that myself bring water for my stain.
Never believe, though in my nature reigned
All frailties that besiege all kinds of blood,
That it could so preposterously be stained
To leave for nothing all thy sum of good;
For nothing this wide universe I call,
Save thou, my rose; in it thou art my all.

### The Tragedy of Hesitation

— Yan Zhewu

——To be or not to be, that's the question.

This is the famous soliloquy from Shakespeare's masterpiece "Hamlet," which clearly represents the feelings of hesitant young people suffering in this era, forming a tragic drama of character! The gist of that famous line is:

"To be, or not to be—that is the question:

Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
Or to take arms against a sea of troubles
And by opposing end them. To die—to sleep—
No more; and by a sleep to say we end
The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks
That flesh is heir to; 'tis a consummation
Devoutly to be wish'd. To die—to sleep.
To sleep, perchance to dream—ay, there's the rub!
For in that sleep of death what dreams may come,
When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
Must give us pause—there's the respect
That makes calamity of so long life.
For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,
Th' oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,
The pangs of despised love, the law's delay,
The insolence of office, and the spurns
That patient merit of th' unworthy takes,
When he himself might his quietus make
With a bare bodkin? Who would fardels bear,
To grunt and sweat under a weary life,
But that the dread of something after death,
The undiscover'd country from whose bourn
No traveller returns, puzzles the will,
And makes us rather bear those ills we have
Than fly to others that we know not of?
Thus conscience does make cowards of us all,
And thus the native hue of resolution
Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,
And enterprises of great pitch and moment
With this regard their currents turn awry
And lose the name of action…"

From Hamlet's beautiful lines of "thinking before acting," we see a kind of life's distress, societal distress, and era's distress, which is why a tragedy of character is produced! This tragedy has its own background, but the tormented thoughts of the sixteenth century still linger in the minds of people in the present era!

To do or not to do? Ascend to heaven or descend to hell? Active or passive? Moral or beneficial? Asceticism or enjoyment? Lofty or simple? Conservative or innovative? – To live or to die?... These uncertain thoughts constantly impact nerves, and people in this transforming era also produce uncertain characters. Especially intellectuals, many are immersed in the "Hamlet type"!

In England, the era Shakespeare encountered was a transitional period of rapid change where the feudal system was declining, the aristocracy was degenerating, the power of royal rule was expanding, commercial capitalism was rising, all old views had collapsed, and new morals had not yet been established. Therefore, people's beliefs in life were also shaken, in a state of doubt, hesitation, and indecision, suffering, lamenting, and even experiencing the sadness of disappointment.

In China, the current era, society, and life we are experiencing are like Shakespeare's time in England, and as he thought in his heart and described in his writing. Everything is in distress! Precisely because we hold new aspirations, but still retain lingering memories of the past, we create a character tragedy of "not being able to be a good person completely, nor being able to be a bad person thoroughly," and we often become the protagonists of this tragedy.

"Thinking before acting" is certainly considerate, but if one thinks too much before doing anything, one will inevitably make mistakes. People with ambition should adopt a "resolute" attitude in this chaotic society, recognize the truth, and not drift with the tide? Firm in will, it does no harm to act according to one's own convictions. Otherwise, looking back on the past and thinking about the present, we will not escape Shakespeare's pen, and will only create more Hamlets and evolve more tragedies of character!

Commemorating Shakespeare's birthday, I remembered that immortal famous line. And from the distress of the transitional era, I am even more alert to avoid falling into the abyss of "hesitation," and should raise the fighting and firm sails, and navigate the turbulent waves of the disconnect between the old and the new in that transitional period!

### This Year's Shakespeare Drama Festival in England

— English: Trovick

The head of the Shakespeare Drama Festival, Jackson, recently announced various plans for Shakespeare in 1947.

This year, these two festivals will last for twenty-five weeks, which can be regarded as the most outstanding since its establishment in 1879.

The cast of this year's performance has fifty actors, led by Bitlerix, Lyman and Robert Tuo, and Hailis. There are nine plays to be performed, eight of which are Shakespeare's plays, and the ninth is Marlowe's "Doctor Faustus."

The Shakespeare Drama Festival opened on April 5, with the first performance of "Romeo and Juliet," with Lawrence and Penny playing Romeo and Daphne, Slater playing Juliet, and Bilerix. Lyman plays the nanny.

This performance is very noteworthy because Jackson entrusted the play to twenty-one-year-old Peter Brook based on his bold experience.

To celebrate Shakespeare's birthday on April 23, "Twelfth Night" will be staged. The commemorative ceremony will be held at noon in the style of the "International Flag". At noon, a bugle will be blown, and the national flags of forty countries will be unfurled by their representatives.

It is expected that many ambassadors and high officials will participate today, lined up to visit Shakespeare's birthplace and his tomb. Afterwards, a public banquet will be held, presided over by Sir Monin, President of the Royal Society.

Other Shakespeare plays to be performed this year include "Love's Labour's Lost", "The Tempest", "Richard II", "The Merchant of Venice" and "Prince of Tyre".

Another feature of this year's drama festival is a series of public lectures, hosted by the custodians of the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre and the British Cultural Committee. These speakers will critique the plays seen on stage during a week.

All scholars studying Shakespeare will also hold an international conference from April 17 to 27. (Special article from the British News Agency)

### Shakespeare's Life

— Xu Xinqin

Shakespeare's life was truly one of simple living to clarify his ambitions and tranquility to achieve far-reaching goals. He never flaunted sectarian views, and although his talents were multifaceted, he did not seek fame or fortune and ignored rights and interests. Throughout his life, he devoted himself to contributing to cultural undertakings. As the son of a country gentleman, he still regarded himself as a country gentleman. His historical dramas can almost be regarded as reliable British history by the world, but the palace crimes and political conspiracies he exposed were not biased preferences, propaganda, or slander. He purely stood on the position of loving the country and the nation, and wrote with passionate emotions and artistic skills in a quick hand, making Spring and Autumn-style criticisms and commendations. Here we can see that the art of the great house is truly immortal!

### Shakespeare's Fourteen Poems

— Zhen Qin

Do not despise the sonnet; critics, listen...Shakespeare used it as a key to open his heart…

——Wordsworth: Sonnets

Shakespeare (born in 1564, died in 1616) was a great writer of the Elizabethan era in England, and can also be said to be the greatest playwright of ancient and modern times. However, his value was not truly recognized by the world until the nineteenth century. After being promoted and magnified by Lessing in Germany and Coleridge in England, Shakespeare's position in literature became supreme. In the seventeenth century, Milton only called Shakespeare:

…Sweetest Shakespeare, Fancy's child,

Warbling his native wood-notes wild,—

—Milton: L'Allegro.

However, by the middle of the nineteenth century, Arnold was already shouting:

…Others abide our question. Thou art free.
We ask and ask—Thou smilest and art still,
Out-topping knowledge…

—Arnold: Shakespeare

However, Shakespeare's plays were still noticed and performed from time to time before the nineteenth century, but his collection of sonnets was basically ignored until the nineteenth century. Once someone paid attention to it, everyone discovered the extraordinary beauty of this collection of poems, and recognized that Shakespeare occupied the same high position in the history of lyric poetry development as he did in the history of drama development.

The reason why this collection of sonnets has become a treasure of the art world is not only because they are exquisite works of art, but also because they tell Shakespeare's inner feelings. Shakespeare, as the greatest writer of ancient and modern times, left us a blank personal history; we can be familiar with the biography of a third-rate writer in the nineteenth century a hundred times more detailed than Shakespeare's, which is a cruel game of history. But fortunately, we have this valuable collection of sonnets, from which we roughly know an important event in Shakespeare's life. The collection contains a total of one hundred and fifty-two sonnets, which can be divided into two series. The first series, from the first to the one hundred and twenty-sixth, is the expression of love to a beautiful young man, continuous, euphemistic, tortuous, poignant, and moving. The second series, from the one hundred and twenty-seventh to the one hundred and fifty-second, is sent to a black-eyed, black-haired "dark lady," expressing passionate and crazy love. Some people say that these poems are just Shakespeare using his own pen to express the feelings of others, just like the dialogues of the characters in his plays, but it is really incomprehensible that such critics cannot delve into the spirit of the works and only make superficial judgments. It is very obvious that these poems are not deliberately created stories but the poet's unconscious and true confession. However, for hundreds of years, critics and textual researchers have competed to explain the background of these poems, such as who the beautiful young man is and whether Shakespeare was a homosexual with him, which is a good scene to watch, but it does not affect the value of these poems themselves.

The form of the sonnet was introduced to England by Wyatt and Surrey in the early sixteenth century. Its rhythm is iambic, with five feet in each line, so it is a pentameter poem. The whole poem has fourteen lines, and the rules of reading feet, the original Italian form, such as that used by Petrarch, is like this:

abba abba cdc dcd

Wyatt's and Surrey's sonnets often have changes, while Shakespeare's sonnets are uniform:

abab cdcd efef gg

Later, all sonnets written in accordance with this rhyme foot rule are called Shakespearean or English, because it is different from the classical or Petrarchan Italian style, and also different from those written by other English poets at the same time as Shakespeare, such as Spenser, who has Spenserian sonnets. But Shakespeare's rhyme foot rule was not created by him. Surrey had used it long ago, and the earliest sonnet writer also used this form.

The so-called sonnet is commonly called Sonnet in English, pronounced "Sonnet", so some people transliterate it as "Shang Lai Style", but in English it can also be called Sonata, the name is the same as the sonata in music or "Lock That". It was originally prepared to be written for singing, so it can be regarded as a kind of lyric poem; but the technique is somewhat dramatic: the concept is introduced in the first four lines, the ups and downs are twisted and entangled in the second and third quatrains, and a clear or abrupt ending is made in the final couplet. The sonnet occupies a very important position in English poetry, although it is a foreign poetic form. Wyatt and Surrey are introducers, Shakespeare is the completer, others such as Spenser, Milton, Wordsworth in the nineteenth century, Keats, E.B. Browning and modern Mascfield and others have rarely seen sonnets after they rose up in poetry.

It seems that there are very few people in our country who introduce Shakespeare's sonnets. With my limited knowledge, I only know three: Mr. Liang Guochun's English-Chinese bilingual "Selected English Poems" translated six poems in Chinese prose, Mr. Liang Zongdai translated several poems, which were published in Mr. Zhu Guangqian's "Literary Magazine" before the war, and in the Xuesheng in wartime Shibao, in addition, there is only one poem in Mr. Li Yuenan's translation collection "Serenade" recently published, but fortunately, it can be regarded as not being translated wrong. Mr. Cao Weifeng has translated the complete works of Shakespeare, and has published many plays, and the collection of sonnets is also listed as one of the complete works, but it has not yet been published, which inevitably makes readers anxious. I have always loved Shakespeare's sonnets, and with the gift of a friend, I obtained a version of Shakespeare's sonnets with notes and a long preface by Ms. Stopes, and I read it in my spare time. I have also occasionally translated several poems when I have nothing to do during my illness.

### Elementary School Teacher Jumps Off Building

— Yue Feng

According to the report, an elementary school teacher named Yu Jingshan committed suicide by jumping off a building the night before last. It is actually wrong to call an elementary school teacher jumping off a building, because when he jumped off the building, he was no longer a teacher, but a servant of a certain clothing company. However, newspaper reporters insisted on emphasizing that he had previously served as an elementary school teacher, and wanted to say that the two suicide notes he left behind were written in a very beautiful style, etc.

The reason for the suicide was that the income was meager and it was difficult to support the family. It can be seen that although he had a beautiful writing style and had been a teacher, it did not help his income. I am afraid that it not only did not help, but also hindered it somewhat. People who have been teachers for a long time always have a bit of lofty arrogance. They have never observed people's expressions and are unwilling to serve others. They only take a fixed salary every month and do not expect any generous rewards or extra money. Therefore, this young man who changed from elementary school teaching to a servant could not increase his income and it was difficult to support his family. Therefore, he could not help but end his life automatically out of anger.

The problem lies in this anger, just as the newspaper headline said that he "degenerated" into a servant. He probably felt that this change of career was a loss of status. Those who have lowered their status but still cannot make the family full of food cannot help but feel angry. He was wrong.

"Don't take off the long gown, the ancestors have accumulated virtue," this is the feudal thinking of the past. Why is it that wearing a long gown is one level higher than wearing short clothes? There is no reason to say this in modern society. Unfortunately, we, the people who wear long gowns, cannot get rid of this kind of thinking, and always work our minds on this side and do not move our hands. Many people would rather die wearing long gowns and refuse to take them off. In spirit, they can be regarded as victorious. The bad thing is that most people have a chasm, but they are forced to cross the chasm to the other side. When jumping, they lack the courage to move forward, their feet move forward, but their heads look back behind them. It is a miracle to fall into the river like this.

When mentioning China's population figures, everyone will answer without thinking, 450 million people. Whether it is 400 million or 450 million, or 470 million, no one can give a definite answer because there are no accurate statistics.

The Donghua Records record that in 1741 (the sixth year of Qianlong), China's population was 143.41 million; in 1841 (the twenty-first year of Daoguang), it was 413.45 million; in 1873 (the twelfth year of Tongzhi), it was 477.13 million. From 1741 to 1841, a century apart, the population increased by 270 million, which is about three times. Based on this speculation, from the first year of the Republic of China to the thirty-sixth year, although there were eight years of the Anti-Japanese War and years of civil strife, and deaths were rampant, it can be asserted that the population has increased without decreasing.

The Japanese Fujiwara Sadato's paper, "The Phenomena of Overpopulation at the End of the Qing Dynasty and the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom Movement" records that the increase rate of cultivated land, assuming it was 100 in 1724 (the second year of Yongzheng), was 133 in 1887 (the thirteenth year of Guangxu). Although the cultivated land area increased, compared with the above-mentioned population increase rate, the relevant multiple is very small.

Population growth has created the phenomenon of overpopulation. Zhang Xiaoming and Fujiwara Sadato discussed that the reason for the outbreak of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom Revolution was caused by overpopulation. China is a country established by agriculture, and the way to solve overpopulation is first, the government implements relief, and second, the people seek their own survival. Government relief means developing industry, improving agricultural production, and reclaiming sandy land and wasteland. The people seek their own survival, that is, they move abroad and become beggars and bandits, so-called strong people scattered in all directions, and the strong take risks.

Shanghai has a population of 3.89 million, and according to newspaper reports, more than half of them are unemployed. The future crisis is unimaginable. How to reduce the number of unemployed people? How to solve the problem of overpopulation? The fundamental policy should be considered as soon as possible.

### Speaking of Riddles

— Zhao Chun

A writer's pen can do everything, in addition to essays and poems, riddles are also one of them. I love the one made by Baoyu in Dream of the Red Chamber the most. The answer is a mirror, and the riddle face collects the four books and says: "Sitting facing south, facing north to worship, like sorrow is also sorrow, like joy is also joy." The generosity of the words and the naturalness of the tone are unprecedented. Thinking carefully about these four words, if they were specially designed for this riddle, wouldn't it be strange!

Recently, at a banquet, a friend described that after Empress Dowager Cixi returned to the capital in the year of Xin Chou, during the Lantern Festival in the year of Ren Yin, she made a riddle herself. The face was four more characters, and the answer was two summer calendar festivals, but she specified that they were not the twenty-four solar terms such as Qingming Guyu, etc., and hung it on the lantern. From the lighting of the lantern on the thirteenth night to the extinguishing of the lantern on the eighteenth day, no one in the palace guessed it in five days. After the Lantern Festival, it was shown to the two Shuyi (i.e., the South Study and the Upper Study) Hanlin, but they all failed to guess it. Finally, Cixi herself announced that it was the two nouns "New Year's Eve" and "Qixi Festival". The difficulty of guessing this riddle is that what is written is four more characters, and people are all thinking about more characters, so it is not easy to guess. If it is written as eight evening characters, then removing one evening is Qixi Festival, which can be known at a glance. Cixi is also cunning. With this cleverness, but the Qing Dynasty collapsed after the Gengzi Incident, it can also be said that he was clever for a lifetime.

### "Xue Pinggui"

— Qi Feng

During the Anti-Japanese War, General Xue Boling (Yue) concurrently managed the Xiang government as commander of the war zone. At that time, prices in Changsha, Hengyang and other places fluctuated extremely violently. Xue first created an evaluation meeting to try to stabilize them. Who knew that holding a meeting to evaluate once was equivalent to acknowledging that the price had legally increased once. As a result, the market storm became more and more out of control. The people of Hunan ridiculed this kind of work as "Xue Pinggui", because Xue's suppression of prices became more and more expensive. It can be seen that General Xue, who won three victories in three battles in northern Hunan and played with the Japanese invaders in the palm of his hand, was helpless against the all-powerful merchants.

Today's situation in Shanghai is also the same. The so-called evaluation meeting has almost become a legislative body for merchants to raise prices. Taking white rice as an example, as late as January of this year, it was only sold for 78,000 yuan per dan. In the gold rush in early February, the official price was adjusted to more than 100,000 yuan due to accepting the rice merchants' reason of "rising prices in the place of origin", retroactively recognizing an increase rate of 30%. At the beginning of this month, capital shifted from the securities market to daily necessities, and prices fluctuated again. Therefore, the official price of white rice was adjusted to more than 120,000 yuan again.

The authorities are meticulous in their concern for the difficulties of merchants, but merchants have never shown any consideration for the common people. At the moment, the price of high-grade white rice is about 20 yuan per dan, and the common people dream of the official limit price of more than 120,000 yuan but cannot get it. Thinking of this, it is heartbreaking. The saying goes: "Govern a chaotic world with severe punishments." Today, seeking a reasonable evaluation is tantamount to seeking a tiger's skin.

### Lessons of a Football Game

— Zhang Jusun

The Seoul team had a good start in their first game in Shanghai, easily defeating the Soviet Union 2-1. Their superb football skills are admirable.

However, in the second battle, the record was set within twelve hours, really like becoming Bonaparte, Napoleon, and losing 2-0 at "Waterloo." It is said that because they were underestimating the enemy, they started with reserve members. After losing two goals in a row, they urgently transferred the regular army to play, but unfortunately the situation was beyond repair. It is really "a wrong step leaves a regret for thousands of years."

(The Seoul team easily defeated the Czech flag in three battles. Are they better than us? Editor).

We do not despise the railway's football skills, but we cannot help but feel something about the passenger car's defeat this time. If we use our country's popular history as a metaphor, we can only say "carelessness loses Jingzhou."

Let's look at the United Press's telegraph: Washington Post sports editor and National Sports Writers and Broadcasters Association President Hanbus announced that the American Celebrity Golf Tournament will be held here at the Columbia Club on May 17th and 18th. Low-pitched singer Bing Crosby will partner with Senate Policy Committee Chairman Taft, and movie star Bing Horber will partner with Army Chief of Staff Eisenhower... Other registrants include House Speaker Martin, Attorney General Clark, and Naval Commander Nimitz, etc. If the Chinese people do not feel ashamed to see such a talent-rich, all-star game, some people may suspect that Americans are going crazy for football. Although they are so enthusiastic about practicing football, the occupying forces still suffered setbacks in playing football in Japan. I believe that if the Japanese team comes to challenge us, even if we use the same methods as against Seoul to create a battle record, we should still keep in mind: the personality of the Japanese is not as good as that of the Koreans!

Taking the battle between Han and the railway as a warning, we have received the lesson that "there is no undefeated army in the world." The motto for success is unique: "Work hard"!

Editor:

In the "Free Talk" column on the 7th of this month, the author of the article "Imaginary Space Floating Machine" ignored that the earth has "revolution" in addition to "rotation". The earth's rotation is the rotation of the earth around the earth's axis, which takes about 24 hours for each rotation, while the revolution is the rotation of the earth around the sun, which takes about one year for each rotation. Because the earth has these two movements at the same time, even if a "fixed space floating machine" can be invented and stay in the original space, the earth's revolution will cause the earth to leave the original empty machine, but because of the earth's revolution, the earth will leave the original space, so if the machine descends, it will fall into the vast space!

According to the latest scientific progress, transportation tools have the potential for complete innovation. The use of atomic energy can greatly enhance the range of aircraft. The use of radar can ensure the safety of flight. The V2 rocket is being tested to be used as a means of transportation between the earth and the moon. These scientific crystals left by the God of War will soon be used for transportation and make people feel simple and comfortable.

The above description may be helpful to those who are interested in "fixed space floating machines". I hope you will publish it. Sincerely, Chen Shishi, April 8, late at night "

### A Tale of a Besieged City

— Qin Shouou

Old Zhu was deep in thought. He understood the psychology of this extremely slick old bureaucrat, knowing that more words would be futile; but this matter was truly making things difficult for him! It was a rare opportunity that Old Zhu was willing to let someone ride in his small chartered car; but the Lan family had three people, and two of them were children, how could they be separated? But to refuse outright would be to miss the opportunity entirely. The situation at the front lines was deteriorating so rapidly, if Lan didn't leave with her two children soon, the future was truly unimaginable.

"Alright!" Finally, he made up his mind—it's better for one to leave than none at all. "Since you can't think of any other way, Commissioner Zhu, I won't press the issue, but I hope that what you just promised won't change!"

"That's for sure!" Jin Aili interjected eagerly. "If his word doesn't count, I'd rather not go! Mr. Zhu, rest assured!"

Old Zhu and Old Zhu both glanced at her.

"Aili, thank you!" Zhu Zhaonian was somewhat moved. "Mrs. Hu can't possibly come with you, so it will probably be Feifei or Xiao Rong, and I'll have to ask you to take special care of them along the way. Mr. and Mrs. Hu will surely be grateful!"

Jin Aili nodded happily. Old Zhu said nothing, even somewhat agreeing. Because he knew that on this journey to Chongqing, he would be very busy with negotiations, buying and selling, and arranging vehicles. Leaving a woman like Jin Aili alone in a hotel or at any friend's house would be worrying. Having a child accompany her was like having a representative of his own. Moreover, the child wouldn't take up much space in the car, and wouldn't affect his planned itinerary.

A waiter hurried in, calling out: "Assistant Zhu, there's a phone call!"

"Very good." Old Zhu quickly stood up and said, "I'll be going now! I'll go talk to Mrs. Hu, and whether it's Feifei or Xiao Rong, I'll definitely bring him here before dinner!" Finally, he added specifically to Old Zhu: "Perhaps there will be one or two pieces of luggage."

"Good! Good! Good!" Old Zhu was eager to send him away, and kept agreeing.

"Rest assured! Leave everything to me!" Jin Aili also stood up to see him off, showing a very responsible demeanor.

So Zhu Zhaonian hurried back to Dongjiang. Since failing to board the train in Ertang last night, Lan was reluctant to return to the Xu family, and Old Zhu didn't advocate for her going back either. Fortunately, everyone in the small school where he was staying had left, and there were many empty rooms, so temporarily staying for a few days was no problem. Thus, Lan and her children set up shop in a large classroom downstairs, using twenty or thirty desks to make a large bed. (42)
