Editorial

### U.S. Congress Convenes Special Session

The U.S. Congress convened a special session yesterday, with President Truman addressing the assembly. The convening of this special session is of considerable significance and is not a frequent occurrence in American history. Typically, the U.S. Congress will reconvene in Washington D.C. in January of the following year, and special congressional sessions are usually avoided unless there are matters of particular importance. As the name suggests, "special" sessions are called only for extraordinary events. Since the founding of the United States, only 25 special congressional sessions have been held in the past 150 years. This time, President Truman invoked the powers granted to him by the U.S. Constitution and, on the 23rd of last month, sent a message to Congress scheduling a special session for the 17th of this month, making it the 26th special congressional session in American history. The convocation of this special session clearly indicates that President Truman considers the current situation to be extremely serious, thus necessitating the special session. Due to recent developments in international affairs, the convening of this special congressional session not only concerns developments in American domestic politics but also has a significant impact on the subsequent evolution of the world situation. Therefore, the convening of this special session is not only of concern to the American people but also attracts the attention of people around the world.

As of this writing, we have not yet had the opportunity to read President Truman's message. However, based on reports from various news agencies, it is not difficult to discern that the purpose of this special congressional session is to seek stability for the world and for the United States itself. The European Recovery Program (ERP), i.e., the Marshall Plan for European aid, and efforts to control the trend of domestic inflation in the United States, are all aimed at achieving stability for the world, especially Western Europe, and the United States. According to reports, the U.S. government will ask Congress to approve the use of $597 million in U.S. dollars as temporary emergency relief for France, Italy, and Austria. At the same time, President Truman will appeal for price stabilization to curb the trend of inflation. As for the long-term plan for European aid, i.e., the estimated $12 billion or $17 billion needed over the next four years, we have not yet received confirmation as to whether it will be proposed or considered at this special congressional session. Regardless of whether the entire European Recovery Program will be presented for consideration at this special congressional session, the convening of this session will undoubtedly involve a review and determination regarding the overall world situation and the domestic situation in the United States.

From the current indications, the convening of this special congressional session will be an important test for President Truman. The U.S. Congress is currently controlled by the Republican Party, and it seems difficult for President Truman, a Democrat, to expect flexible maneuvering during this special congressional session. Therefore, President Truman is attempting to present the European aid plan and the price control plan as policies that transcend partisan interests and are supported by the entire country. Whether members of Congress, the majority of whom are Republicans, can accept this policy remains to be seen, but based on current indications, President Truman may encounter difficulties.

Firstly, from the perspective of foreign policy, since General Marshall returned to the United States to take office as Secretary of State, the United States has lacked a clear and firm policy toward the Far East. General Wedemeyer's report remains in the State Department's safe without being published, while Marshall's plan for aid to Europe is particularly large. Republican congressmen such as Senator Taft have already criticized this, arguing that the aid plan for Europe must be proposed at the same time as the aid plan for China in order to have a complete world plan. According to a report in "Time" magazine, Marshall finally changed his policy of watchful waiting toward China in response to pressure from Congress and proposed his $300 million aid plan for China. This is hardly comparable to his proposed aid plan for Europe. It can be seen that Congress and the government do not entirely agree on foreign policy. According to available news, Congress will only consider the temporary plan for aid to Europe, but even this temporary plan may not be fully supported by Congress.

Secondly, speaking of the domestic situation in the United States, President Truman's opposition to tax cuts is also in conflict with the Republican Party's policy. The Republican Party naturally wants to win over voters for next year's presidential election, and the only effective way to win over voters is through tax cuts. Now, the plan for aid to Europe involves a huge sum of money, and President Truman believes that this huge sum must rely on tax revenue to support it in order to avoid inflation. However, Republican congressmen may not see it that way. As for how to control the soaring prices in the United States, if President Truman advocates restoring wartime price controls or a rationing system, Republicans may also be unwilling to accept it. Therefore, in terms of domestic policy, President Truman's policies and the Republican-controlled Congress may not be able to blend harmoniously.

However, standing in the objective position of a third party and from a broader perspective, we hope that the convening of this special congressional session will achieve satisfactory results. It has been two years since the end of the war, but the world as a whole is still in turmoil. In this turbulent world, the United States is undoubtedly the only stabilizing force. We hope that American politicians can have a broad global vision, not be stubborn with their own prejudices, and not be constrained by partisan political struggles, and can make comprehensive plans for the current global situation. Only in this way can they be worthy of being the world's leaders.

### Chairman Receives French Medal

(Continued from page one) "Mr. Chairman: I am deeply honored to be here on behalf of the President of France to bestow upon you the Military Medal. The heroes of China's War of Resistance, unparalleled in their courage and determination, are admired infinitely by the government of my country. Your strategic planning is exemplary, and therefore we specially bestow upon you the highest French Military Medal, to commend your outstanding contributions. In those years, the Chinese and French armies fought together, which strengthened the bond between the two countries. This honor is bestowed to commemorate this forever. Observing the enemy's rampant actions, both the Chinese and French nations are aware of the cruelty of invasion, and both have been tempered to fight to the death for the freedom of their homelands. The banner of victory will ultimately fly with triumphant songs. Today, the people of China and France look forward to the future, and all hope that the world of tomorrow will become a paradise of freedom and justice, so that future generations will be forever spared the pain of trampling and bloodshed. The significance of this award, has been fully described in the award speech, which is based on the order of the French army. Now I will read it to you:

Chairman Chiang of the National Government of the Republic of China, with his unwavering belief in the future of his country, was the first to rise up to resist totalitarian imperialism and its invasion of peaceful nations. Since July 7, 1937, he has led the people of the whole country to resist foreign aggression with diligence and perseverance. First he fought alone, and then he cooperated with the Allied nations. He led and commanded this glorious and arduous battle for years, until the Japanese invaders surrendered. As the leader who presided over this most difficult war of resistance, he has won the eternal praise and admiration of all democratic countries."

### Japanese Reparation Goods Are Good

(Continued from page one) Regarding the handling of all Japanese reparations goods, Mr. Zhou said: The Tokyo Reparations Committee is continuing to discuss the matter. The second batch of goods to be dismantled and removed, including experimental research equipment from the army, navy, and air force arsenals, as well as synthetic rubber equipment, will have their allocation amounts agreed upon by various countries in the near future. He expressed his satisfaction with the harmonious atmosphere within the Reparations Committee, which he considered rare among international organizations. However, he predicted that disputes among countries would be inevitable when the handling of piece-by-piece reparations tools is completed and the dismantling and selection of entire factories begins. Mr. Zhou went on to remind the people of the country of their understanding of reparations goods, saying: Reparations goods are not scrap metal. Based on our observations after visiting more than 100 Japanese factories, the quality of Japanese factories is generally very good. Japanese factories use the most advanced manufacturing methods in the world, and even in the chemical industry, the United States is beyond their reach. Therefore, we should pay attention to reparations goods. The significance of obtaining reparations goods lies not only in restricting Japan's industrial level but also in using them to establish our country's basic industries.

Even after searching through the Twenty-Four Histories, no such records can be found. Anyone with a human heart hates them. The people in the bandit areas are all confused, and everyone's face is withered, yellow, and thin. They (the Communist bandits) keep talking about democracy and freedom of speech, but have they done any of it? Isn't it just that group of male bandits and female prostitutes who monopolize everything! No one in the bandit area dares to fart. They must say that they are good. If they say that they are not good, they are either KMT spies or reactionaries, and their lives are in danger! I have truly tasted the taste of the Communist bandits. Now, with the illusion of being dead yesterday and alive today, I will do my best for the country to help in this suppression work and complete the great cause of national construction. We must send these inhuman and evil Communist bandits all into the fire pit so that China can see the light of day again."

### Supervisory Committee Proposes Three Points to Improve Military Uniforms and Rations

Submitted to the Executive Yuan by President Yu

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 17th] Li Shijun, a supervisor of the Control Yuan, believes that the quality of military uniforms and rations is of great importance during the period of mobilization and war, as it affects the morale and health of soldiers. He has put forward three suggestions for improvement, which have been submitted to the Executive Yuan by President Yu for attention and improvement. The suggestions are as follows: The cloth used for military uniforms must meet the specified standards for color, area, weight, etc. The supply agencies should formally sign a contract with the China Textile Corporation or other specialized textile manufacturers, and the audit department should send personnel to inspect and accept the goods at the time of delivery. If there is any non-compliance or delay in delivery, the contractors should bear legal responsibility. The cotton used in winter uniforms for officers and soldiers must meet the specified standards and must not be short in weight or substandard in quality. Military rations and flour must meet the specified standards. The grain administration agencies should be responsible for this, and the military flour should maintain a precision of 75%. First- and second-class flour must not be extracted. If the quality of military rations and flour is found to be substandard after delivery, the receiving agency should be responsible. If the quality is questioned by the receiving personnel at the time of delivery, the audit agency or the inspector's office in the locality should send personnel to identify it together with representatives of the highest local public opinion organs.

### Chinese Immigrants to the Philippines Face Strict Restrictions

Some Philippine Congressmen Are Still Unsatisfied

[Central News Agency, Manila, 17th] The Philippines has extremely strict restrictions on the entry of foreigners, especially Chinese citizens. According to statistics from the Philippine Immigration Bureau's records, from February 1946 to the end of October this year, the Immigration Bureau has only allowed 129 students, 32 teachers, and 40 Chinese "temporary visitors" to enter the country. The Philippine Immigration Law has many similarities with the U.S. Immigration Law. All non-immigrant aliens, or those entering the Philippines within the annual immigration quota, are considered "temporary visitors" whose period of stay is only six months, after which they can apply for an extension of six months. Students and teachers can enter under more lenient procedures, but after entry, they must be subject to inquiries by the Immigration Bureau at any time to prove that they have not engaged in other businesses during their stay in the Philippines. Upon completion of their studies or teaching, they must leave the country. Furthermore, among the 40 "temporary visitors" in the past year and eight months, according to reporters, some who were approved never came to the Philippines, and some went back and forth between China, which resulted in several people being counted as one. The general situation regarding the restrictions on the entry of foreigners can be seen from this. However, some congressmen still believe this is insufficient and intend to find ways to strengthen the restrictions on entry.

### Two Hundred Workers Die Tragically in a Coal Mine

### Kang Province Tightens County-Level Organizations

[This Newspaper, Yaan, 17th] The counties in Kang Province are all barren, and their revenues and expenditures cannot be balanced.

All provinces, cities where elections cannot be held in whole or in part, and counties, cities, and equivalent areas where elections are being continued after being disrupted by bandits, should be handled in accordance with the provisions of these regulations in order to achieve uniformity.

Article 1 of the supplementary regulations on the election refers to provinces, regions, counties, cities, and their equivalent areas or organizations within those areas where elections cannot be held in whole. If elections cannot be held in whole or in part on the date this measure arrives, the election offices of the relevant provinces, regions, counties, and cities should hold elections in their neighboring areas or designated places in accordance with the procedures stipulated in the regulations. The procedures to be followed should be in accordance with the following provisions: When elections cannot be held in whole or in part in a province or in various regions or hospitals within a province or city, elections should be held in the province, city, or region election office located. When elections cannot be held in whole or in part in counties, cities, and equivalent areas, elections should be held in the county or city and their equivalent area election office located.

The procedures, times, and dates stipulated in Article 1 of the supplementary regulations on the election should be determined by the higher-level election authorities by order, but the voting date should not be later than December 23rd. Voting for delegates to the National Assembly and members of the Legislative Yuan may be held simultaneously, but voting and counting should be done separately. However, the public announcement and compilation of the register of electors may be carried out jointly.

If the election authorities of counties, cities, and equivalent areas that handle elections in accordance with Article 3 of the supplementary regulations on the election have not been established in accordance with the law on the date this measure arrives, their election affairs shall be handled concurrently by the provincial election offices. The same applies to the district election offices of legislators who are elected by districts that have not been established in accordance with the law.

In accordance with Article 5 of the supplementary regulations on the election, if the area where elections can be held in counties, cities, and equivalent areas has reached more than two-thirds, and the population has also reached more than two-thirds, the elected delegates to the National Assembly shall have the same validity as those elected under the election and recall laws of the relevant areas. In accordance with the same article, if the electoral area or unit of legislators has reached more than two-thirds of the area where elections can be held, and its population has also reached more than two-thirds, the elected legislators shall have the same validity as those elected under the election and recall laws of the relevant areas.

### U.S. Congress Special Session Convened, Truman Strongly Urges Aid to Europe, and Proposes Ten Basic Economic Measures

[This Newspaper] New York, 17th Broadcast: Washington News, the 26th U.S. Congress Special Session in history convened at 10 a.m. today. After Speaker of the House Martin and Senate President Vandenberg announced the opening of the meeting, President Truman (see picture) attended and delivered a speech, clarifying the government's attitude on the two major issues of aid to Europe and preventing domestic inflation. He strongly advocated using $597 million as emergency aid to Italy, France, and Austria, and in order to prevent the economic situation from affecting the United States domestically, he proposed ten basic measures: 1. Ration consumer goods that are scarce domestically and sufficient to affect people's lives; 2. Set price limits for domestic scarce and sufficient products to affect people's lives, and in order to implement the stipulated price limits, appropriate restrictions should be placed on wages; 3. Strengthen housing rent control; 4. Control scarce materials that are closely related to life; 5. Speculative commodity transactions should be controlled; 6. Restrict bank lending; 7. Strengthen export controls; 8. Continue to control the distribution of transportation vehicles and equipment; 9. Restrict the use of grains to feed livestock and poultry, so that grains can be used for more practical needs; 10. Authorize the Department of Agriculture to draft plans to encourage people to store food and find ways to increase production abroad.

President Truman praised Marshall's aid to Europe plan. According to estimates by Marshall, the amount of U.S. aid to Europe within four years will be between 16 billion and 20 billion. The President urged Congress to quickly pass the $597 million in emergency aid to Italy, France, and Austria to help them through the difficult winter, believing that this action could prove the United States' determination to support Western European countries in maintaining democracy and freedom until they can become self-sufficient. If Congress can pass emergency aid and then pass long-term aid, it will write a glorious page in world history. But in order to achieve this goal, domestic economics must also strive for stability, because aid to Europe and economic controls are complementary.

1. The U.S. Congress Special Session's Development Will Affect Future Leadership

[Central News Agency, Washington, 16th, United Press] The U.S. Congress Special Session convened this Monday will be seen around the world as a measure of the United States' willingness and ability to enhance its leadership position in the world after World War II. The speed and determination with which Congress completes legislation on the reconstruction of Western Europe can indicate whether historical trends will lead the United States to relinquish its major responsibilities overseas after the war, or will instead strengthen its political power in the world. This Congress Special Session will continue until the normal Congress convenes on January 3rd of next year. Although the leaders will follow the purpose of convening the special session and try to focus their initial attention on issues such as temporary aid and measures to prevent inflation, congressional regulations still allow other issues to be raised to Congress before January of next year.

Other issues awaiting formal congressional action include the immigration of refugees, general policy toward China, the progress and effectiveness of U.S. aid to Greece and Turkey, the behavior and discipline of U.S. military and political personnel in occupied countries, authorization for the "Voice of America" broadcasting program or other news organizations to refute the Communist International's reports on the U.S. situation, the situation of overseas surplus materials, the currency of occupied countries, the situation of oil mines in the Middle East, and the Anglo-American oil agreement. The U.S. government will also choose an appropriate time to submit the Rio de Janeiro Inter-American Security Treaty to the Senate for approval. Judging from the participation of Vandenberg and Connally in the Rio de Janeiro Conference, the treaty can be quickly approved. During the debate on the Marshall Plan, Congress may spark a discussion on Pan-American economic issues.

### On the Issue of Limiting the Use of the Veto Power, the United States and the Soviet Union Will Clash Head-On, the United Nations General Assembly is Nearing its End

[United Press, Lake Success, 16th] The United States today seems confident of victory in the General Assembly on its proposal to study how to ease and limit the use of the veto power by the five permanent members of the Security Council for a period of one year. U.S. Representative Dulles told Soviet Representative Gromyko in a private consultation yesterday that the United States would push forward with this movement regardless of the Soviet Union's strong opposition to limiting the veto power.

Dulles essentially notified the Soviet Union that it would demand the abolition of the use of the veto power in cases submitted to the Security Council under the chapter of the Constitution on peaceful resolution and in cases concerning the admission of new member states to the United Nations. In this way, the use of the veto power would be limited only to cases directly threatening peace or aggression. It is reported that Gromyko solemnly stated that the Soviet Union is determined to maintain the veto power unchanged and opposes any attacks on this power by small countries. Any changes to the veto power clauses in the United Nations Charter are themselves bound by the veto power, so at this time, no matter whether the General Assembly demands changes or not, any actual changes are impossible. Voting on this issue is expected to take place after the resolution of the South African discrimination against Indians case on the 17th.

[United Press, Flushing, 17th] The United Nations General Assembly has begun its tenth week, which may also be the last week of work for the 1947 session. The future of Palestine and the issue of the five permanent members' veto power are still awaiting discussion.

### On the Eve of the Foreign Ministers' Conference, Germany Expresses its Wishes

Opposes the Separation of Saar from Germany

[Reuters, Berlin, 16th] The leader of the German Christian Democratic Party, Kaiser, gave a speech at a public meeting here, emphasizing that the German people will never accept the Oder-Neisse line as the border between Germany and Poland, and the separation of the Saar region from Germany. The Oder-Neisse line will make it impossible for the German people to manufacture compensation goods, so it is by no means a fair and just peaceful resolution. The German people will also never agree to the political or economic separation of the Saar region from Germany. Kaiser also advocated that the peace treaty with Germany should at least stipulate the future program of the German state and stipulate a compensation plan.

### Japanese Communist Party Launches Offensive: Conspires to Incite Nationwide General Strike

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 16th] According to sources close to the headquarters of the Japanese Communist Party, general labor unions incited by the Communist Party are currently adopting guerilla tactics. These unions have now launched an offensive, and their power is gradually expanding nationwide.

Up until a few days ago, there were 58 labor unions on strike in Japan, and another 216 labor unions were also brewing strikes. The aforementioned figures do not include hundreds of communist-affiliated groups, such as public utility agencies run by the government, where employers are now attempting to take slowdown actions. Communist labor organizers claim that the number of workers currently participating in strikes exceeds that of the general strike planned for February 1st of this year. It is reported that the number of workers participating in the general strike at the beginning of this year totaled 2.5 million. Communist labor leaders today claim that the number of workers participating in strikes across the country exceeds 3 million. In other words, the power of the so-called Japanese labor movement has largely recovered after being severely damaged in February of this year. The organizers of the strike movement intend to create a situation in which industry is paralyzed, public utilities are shut down, and the national economy is in a slump, so that the government finds itself politically unable to stand. Communist labor leaders have not set a deadline for their offensive, but believe that a crisis will occur no later than March of next year.

Mayor Wu earnestly explained the authorities' painstaking efforts to build a new Shanghai and urged the residents to understand the difficulties and cooperate sincerely. If there are still those who have not demolished and relocated by the deadline, in addition to the government's compulsory execution, the households that have not demolished and relocated shall compensate the government for the losses incurred due to the delay of the project. All of this shall be guaranteed by the heads of the households to the Public Works Bureau. Among them, the Huizhong Tobacco Factory and the Xiechang Shunji Timber Company have ample land left after demolition and relocation. Mayor Wu instructed the heads of the two households to follow the government's laws and regulations, strive to be role models for citizens, and voluntarily relocate from today.

[Reported by this newspaper] The case of Chen Zhanzhi, the "double-gun robber," robbing a 1947 Chevrolet champagne sedan belonging to Mrs. Hecha, the Russian manager of the American Coal Company, at around 2:00 PM on the 30th of last month, being intercepted and arrested in front of the Municipal Police Bureau on Fuzhou Road, was sent to the District Court on the 15th of this month after interrogation by the Criminal Division of the Police Bureau. Yesterday, it was brought to the Third Criminal Court for questioning, presided over by Judge Hu Zhichao. Chen Zhanzhi has a handsome face and a slender body, wearing a gray suit and a herringbone overcoat, with gold-rimmed glasses on his nose. He confessed: "I am 23 years old, from Zhongshan County, Guangdong Province, a graduate of the Overseas Chinese Middle School. I used to work as a translator for the US military and am currently unemployed. I came to Shanghai on October 21st of this year and stayed at Room 1311 on the 13th floor of the International Hotel. At noon on the 30th, I saw a blue car parked on Gufu Road. I sat in and threatened the driver with a revolver to drive to Longhua, and then to Jing'an Temple Road. He refused to drive any further, so I let him go down. I drove east myself to the front of the police station on Fourth Ma Road, where I was surrounded by the police. I took out a revolver at the time, ready to commit suicide, but they took it away. Later, when I arrived at the police station, I wanted to jump from the fourth floor to commit suicide, but I didn't succeed." Chen stopped after stating all this in one breath, and frequently wiped his sweat with a handkerchief. Judge Hu asked what he intended to do if he had not been arrested that day. Chen replied, "I planned to drive to the entrance of a dance hall and rob rich people with guns." When asked where the two revolvers came from, he replied, "I bought them from the US military, one for 50 US dollars and the other for 75 US dollars." The confession ended here, and the court was adjourned, scheduled for continuation on the 26th.

### Chairman Pan Continues to Visit Yimiao and Other Districts, Explaining the True Meaning of Democratic Politics, All Citizens Should Not Give Up Voting

[Our Newspaper] City Council Speaker Pan, yesterday (17th) continued to visit Yimiao, Fahua, Xuhui and other districts, visiting and giving campaign speeches. And at the joint expanded memorial week of the Kuomintang Party Headquarters of the third and fourth districts of this city, and the swearing-in ceremony of the executive committee members of various district branches, he stated the attitude that party members should have when participating in this election.

Chairman Pan first went to Nanshi at 10:00 am to visit various Bao in the Yimiao District, summarizing the opinions of representatives from various Bao. All agreed that the most important facility that must be improved at present is the electricity problem, because the citizens in the Nanshi area often suffer from power outages and hope that the authorities will pay attention. The chairman then gave a public speech at Guangfu Temple, attended by more than a thousand listeners.

Enhance the People's Democratic Level

During the meeting, he issued the essentials of constitutionalism, saying: China is moving towards a democratic path, and we must truly understand the meaning of democracy in order to obtain true democracy. The so-called true democracy is that the people have opinions and requests, which can be expressed to the government through reasonable and legal procedures, and all actions of the government must also respect public opinion, so that the government and the people can be one. The government now stipulates that the general election will be held on the 21st, 22nd, and 23rd of this month, and the constitution will be formally implemented on December 25th, which means reaching the constitutional stage, which means implementing democracy. The so-called constitutionalism is to change the people from being "governed" to "self-governed", and politics from "rule by man" to "rule of law", sweeping away the ills of "government exists when the person exists, and government ceases when the person dies". The people must have the power to manage people and the power to manage laws, the power to elect good people to do things, the power to remove officials who violate public opinion, the power to create laws they need, and the power to veto laws that harm the interests of the people, so that everything can be reformed by voting, without the need to mobilize millions of troops to fight for it. Therefore, these powers are rights and responsibilities. All citizens cannot give up the responsibilities that a master should have. Democratic politics is voting politics. Easily giving up voting means giving up democratic politics. That failing country must go down the path of guns and bullets. As for whether the country will embark on the right path of recovery, it depends on whether voters are enthusiastic in this election. Therefore, I hope everyone will be skilled in voting to improve national status and enhance the people's democratic level.

Will Seek More Benefits for Nanshi

When Mr. Pan stated the attitude that party members should have to the party headquarters of the third and fourth districts of this city, he gave two instructions: Comrades of our party should obey the party's instructions and orders. The candidates nominated by our party should be fully supported by all party members. Anyone who does not comply with party orders and runs for election without authorization will be sanctioned. Those from friendly parties and society who participate in the election should be assisted from the side so that they can jointly be responsible for national construction. In addition, he especially told the citizens of Nanshi: Nanshi is the source of Shanghai's prosperity, but because the concessions have been recovered, all facilities are more convenient than those in Nanshi. Therefore, the center of Shanghai's prosperity is still concentrated in the old concessions, causing Nanshi to lag behind. I hope that the citizens of Nanshi will catch up quickly, work together, and restore the past prosperity so that the old concession area will not be too crowded. In the future, I hope that the citizens of Nanshi will jointly support his campaign for the National Assembly representatives so that he can better serve the citizens of Nanshi and seek benefits for the citizens of Shanghai.

Speech at Zhongzheng Park Today

In the afternoon, Chairman Pan went to Xuhui District again and gave campaign speeches at Fahua Primary School and Tushanwan Orphanage. The chairman greatly admired the Fahua Mutual Aid Association for being able to gather local forces to build local autonomy, and hoped that it could be further promoted in the future.

Today (18th) at 3:00 pm, Chairman Pan will go to Jingzhou Road Elementary School in Jianlin District to give a speech on the topic "Appealing for Refugees"! At 4:00 pm, a large-scale campaign speech will be given in the square of Zhongzheng Park (ie Hongkou Public Concession) at the end of North Sichuan Road. The Friends of the Military Society will be responsible for entertainment programs in advance to entertain the audience.

The Medical Community Unanimously Elected Yao Yunjiang, Chairman of the Chinese National Medical Association, Tang Jifu, Executive Director, and Bao Juxiang, Director and Secretary-General, telegraphed the Shanghai National Medical Branch, the Shanghai Chinese Medicine Practitioners Association, the Shanghai National Medicine Industry Association, the Shanghai Medicinal Materials Industry Association, the Shanghai Ginseng and Bird's Nest Industry Association, the Shanghai Leaf Industry Workers Union, various Chinese Medicine Hospitals, various Chinese Medicine Schools, Chinese Medicine Training Courses, Huzhou Shanghai Small and Medium Schools, and the Shanghai Industry Association yesterday, because Chen Guofu gave up running for the National Assembly representative in Shanghai, please unanimously re-elect Chairman Pan Gongzhan, because Chairman Pan has always been enthusiastic about maintaining Chinese medicine.

Poor Students Endorse One After Another

According to Zheng Jie, the executive director of the Shanghai Scholarship Unified Review Committee, since the Central Government announced that Pan Zhurenwei Gongzhan of this committee was a candidate for the National Assembly representative in this city, poor students and their parents at all levels of schools in this city believed that Pan had spared no effort in presiding over the rescue of out-of-school work over the years, and appreciated the youth very much. Therefore, they have sent letters to this committee, expressing their willingness to elect Pan as the National Assembly representative in this city, and some students above the junior college level volunteered to assist Pan in promoting the campaign work. As of now, the committee has received more than 5,000 of these letters.

### Fang Zhi Gives a Speech, Speaking the Truth for the Common People

Fang, the director of the Kuomintang Municipal Party Headquarters, gave public campaign speeches in the Tilamqiao District and the Datang District yesterday morning and afternoon, respectively, "Speaking a heartfelt word for the common people." He said briefly: To build a country, we must implement democratic constitutionalism, and to implement democratic constitutionalism, we must first start with handling elections. Only by completing the election can we implement democracy. This election of National Assembly representatives is really too important. If the elected representatives cannot speak for the common people, or what they say is not what the common people want to say, the relationship is really too important. Therefore, I hope that everyone will vote with conscience when voting, and vote for the person you think can represent you and speak the truth. Don't be bought by money and don't be coerced by violence, etc.

Also, the city's stone industry and other groups expressed their support for Fang's election as a National Assembly representative and jointly issued a declaration.

### Jiao Dingkai Gives Up the Election

Mr. Jiao Dingkai, a well-known accountant and candidate for the National Assembly representative in this city, was repeatedly urged by senior fellow villagers to register and support his campaign. Recently, I heard that Jiao decided to give up the election due to the heavy workload of association affairs and business, and hoped that all fellow villagers would unanimously elect Can Neng.

### The Most Advanced High-Altitude Passenger Aircraft, Central Airlines Orders Six from the United States

[Our Newspaper] Central Airlines recently ordered six Convair passenger aircraft from the American Voltee Company. They will be shipped one after another between March and May next year. This type of Convair passenger aircraft is the latest twin-engine aircraft exclusively for passenger transport approved by the US Civil Aviation Administration after the war. Its characteristics are: Equipped for high altitude, when flying at an altitude of more than 10,000 feet, the cabin has its own air, so passengers will not feel uncomfortable at all, and it is especially safe for those with weak hearts. The speed is faster than ordinary airplanes, reaching 300 miles per hour. The engine cover can be completely disassembled for easy repair. The propeller can rotate in the opposite direction, causing the effect of stopping forward, and assisting the braking force, so it can also land on a shorter runway. The seats in the aircraft are comfortable and equipped with sound insulation.

[Also News] Since the American-made DG-6 giant aircraft was launched, the aircraft has been grounded repeatedly. After experts have made detailed studies, the aircraft will be flown again. Our country's airlines originally planned to purchase this type of aircraft, but now it has been abandoned.

### Surveying the Middle Section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway, Bridge Travel

[Our Newspaper, Tai'an, 14th] There are four major bridges in the 156 kilometers from Yanzhou to Jinan. The destruction of the four major bridges by the communist bandits can be described as "painstaking". The largest of these is the Wenhe Bridge, which is 386.4 meters long, followed by the Xiaowenhe Bridge, which is 351.8 meters long, for a total of 738.2 meters. The second is the Panhe Bridge south of Tai'an, which is 265 meters long. The third is the Geyuhe Bridge about 2 kilometers south of Wander, which is 304 meters long, and the fourth is the Shidianhe Bridge about 5 kilometers south of Zhangxia, which is 215 meters long (the four major bridges are arranged in order from south to north). According to the villagers, the communist bandits spent more than 70 days destroying the four bridges, and the Shidianhe Bridge also took 40 days to complete the degree of destruction that the communist bandits considered satisfactory.

The Four Arches Were Most Severely Damaged

As of the time this reporter wrote this article, the Wenhe and Panhe bridges had already been restored, but both bridges are still temporary bridges. The former cost 30,000 sleepers, and the latter cost 8,000 sleepers, and they need to be rebuilt as permanent steel bridges. The Yantai line of the road has also been running a traffic car between Yanzhou and Tai'an once a day since the 10th of this month. The Geyuhe Bridge was originally a 14-arch cement bridge. After being destroyed, the four arches on the north side were filled with soil to save materials. The bridge piers with minor damage were repaired, and those with severe damage were rebuilt. Among them, the four arches in the middle with the most severe damage would take too long to rebuild according to the original style, but in order to get it done once and for all, Song Liancheng, the deputy director of the Engineering Department of the bureau, Song Jianfang, the section chief, and Wen Diao, the captain of the Ji'an repair team, "thought hard" and implemented "bridge travel", transferring two sections of the two-arch 23-meter steel bridge 3 kilometers away from the bridge and two sections of the 20-meter steel machine 361 meters away from it. They were moved to the Geyuhe River to fill the four holes. (The two bridges originally passed through the river, but because they have been silted up, there is no need for bridges in fact), and became a permanent project with six arched bridges and four steel structures. Although this is very unsightly on the outside, it is as strong as a new bridge in terms of firmness.

Miracle of Bridge Travel

However, "bridge travel" is really easier said than done. When the tools are extremely simple and limited by the objective environment, and some of the tools are sometimes unusable, it is the employees of the road who have come up with unique ideas and ingenious designs. It was not easy to "travel" the four steel bridges to the Geyuhe River, because the steel bridges weighed hundreds of tons, or at least eighty tons, and the largest lifting machine the road had was only forty tons. Even if two forty-ton machines were used at the same time at both ends, the northern side could not be transported due to the isolation of Jinan from the outside. Therefore, they could only lay sleepers on the Geyuhe River (in fact, because there were few sleepers, they could only lay them on two arches), and move the hundred-ton steel bridge to the sleepers with great difficulty. Then, multiple 35-ton or 50-ton "clamps" were placed on the bottom beam of the steel bridge, and slowly lifted root by root, and the sleepers were removed one by one until the two ends of the steel bridge were smoothly placed on the stone structure. Today, the northwest wind is strong, and the employees are especially cautious and fearful when working, so as to avoid accidents.

Unnamed Heroes of Road Construction

Although the length of the Shidianhe Bridge is the shortest among the four major bridges, it is 22 meters deep, so the enemy tried their best when repairing it. As early as the end of the Anti-Japanese War, the Japanese invaders, fearing that the bridge would be bombed and affect their north-south traffic, built another temporary bridge several hundred meters west of the original bridge. The bridge was not completed when the Japanese invaders surrendered, and the project was terminated. The road bureau planned to restore the water-resistant steel bridge, which could not be completed in the short term. It used more than 11,000 sleepers to build the temporary bridge first, and in order to reduce the slope of the road surface (the terrain is particularly high) and the depth of the bridge piers, it dug a channel on both sides, which was 5 kilometers long, and 110,000 cubic meters of earthwork, costing more than 60,000 man-days. This is as Captain An said: "We can only rely on human power to make up for the lack of material resources." He also said: "The most hardworking and resilient workers in the world are Chinese workers, and the Chinese workers are the most capable of 'lifting' under the most inferior tool conditions in the world." The biggest feeling I had after witnessing the Tianjin-Pukou Middle Section Yanjin Section, which was condensed by the blood and sweat of all these ten thousand railway employees, was: "In order to call on and study the technology of breaking roads, the Communist Party has long launched a so-called 'explosion hero', and publicly gave this kind of hero many material and honorary encouragements. On the other hand, the government side, like the above-mentioned Song An and others, actually does not know how many unnamed heroes of road construction are there. Who cares about them for completing the sublime national construction project?" (Our newspaper sent a special correspondent, Li Tian)

### Hai Ning Uncovers Trafficking Ring of Young Girls; Group of Perpetrators Transferred to District Court for Trial

Li Jinhua Deceived, Resolutely Refuses, Insisting on Returning Home

Qin Zhumei Abused by Stepmother, Lured Away When Going Out

[Our Newspaper Hai Ning, 16th Dispatch] The county police bureau recently uncovered an organized trafficking ring of young girls and has already transferred one thousand perpetrators to the district court for trial on the 16th. The incident began on the 14th at 8 p.m., when the bureau received a telegram from the road patrol's public self-defense force, stating that they had apprehended a human trafficker named Song Xiaogou and a 14-year-old girl who had been victimized. They also claimed that Song Xiaogou had implicated an accomplice named Dong Wangshi from Hangzhou, who was hiding at No. 30 Yongxiu Fang, Southwest River, Xia Shi. The bureau immediately dispatched a patrol officer and police to apprehend Dong Wangshi, bringing her back to the bureau. Dong Wangshi claimed to be from Shaoxing, 80 years old, residing on Laodong Road, Hangzhou. At first, she denied any involvement in trafficking young girls, but after several interrogations, she confessed that she had accomplices named Chu Ma, residing at No. 66 Lower East Street, Xia Shi, and Gu Xiangshi, residing at Xutou, Xia Shi. The police went to arrest them one after another, and at Gu Xiangshi's residence in Hengtou, they rescued a young girl named Li Jinhua.

According to Li Jinhua's statement, she is from Zhuji, 16 years old, with a father named Li Gengqian and a mother named Yang. Due to poverty, she went to Hangzhou alone to find her younger uncle, intending to work as a servant for someone. However, the wages were too low. Later, she met Chu Ma, who told her that there was work in Xia Shi with high wages. She went to Xia Shi with Chu Ma last month. She was taken to Shanghai by Wu Zhu Shi, who lived at No. 2 Qun'en Road, Xia Shi, to be sold as a maid, but the price was not right. She returned to Xia Shi and was locked up in Gu Xiangshi's house. Later, Grandma Dou (residing at Shilan Bridge, Lower East Guard, Xia Shi) introduced two Songjiang people who intended to buy her for 15 dan of grain and some cash. When Jinhua learned of this, she realized she had been deceived. She resolutely refused and insisted on being allowed to return home. Gu Xiangshi then invited two men, one wearing a yellow uniform and a wooden-handled gun, the other wearing a blue cloth long gown and a felt hat, to threaten her. Fortunately, the police arrived, and she was rescued from the fire pit. After the police interrogated the perpetrators, they dispatched officers to arrest the relevant accomplices.

Furthermore, the human trafficker Song Xiaogou, the buyer Shen Sanmao, and the deceived girl Qin Zhumei, who were apprehended by the road patrol's public self-defense force, were handed over to the bureau on the 15th and interrogated by the judicial section. According to Qin Zhumei's statement, she is from Hang County, residing at Hair'er Lane, Hangzhou. She ran away from home due to abuse from her stepmother. She met a woman on the road (namely Dong Wangshi, who was apprehended in Xia Shi), who lured her to Xia Shi. She lived in Song Xiaogou's house and was lured to Shen Sanmao's house in Beicheng, Luzhong, on the 10th. Shen Sanmao took her to the home of Second Aunt Wang, a boat dweller on Luzhong Street, intending to sell her for ten dan of rice. Later, after learning that Qin Zhumei's background was unknown, they refused to take her and reported it to the Luzhong Township Self-Defense Force. This organized trafficking case was thus uncovered.

The authorities believe that the case involves significant matters and that Li Jinhua and Qin Zhumei may not be the only deceived girls. They are currently continuing the investigation and may make new discoveries.

Protect tenant farmers, thoroughly implement the "three-one rent reduction," and prohibit landlords from seeking revenge, retaliating, or arbitrarily evicting tenants. 4. Punish corruption and protect human rights and property rights. If any unscrupulous elements take advantage of the situation to extort, arbitrarily impose levies, or harass the people, they may be reported to the Special Commissioner's Office, and once verified, they will be severely punished. 5. Welcome those who return. Those who have been coerced into becoming bandits and can thoroughly repent and return will be treated favorably without being prosecuted for past offenses.

### Geological Society of China Annual Meeting Held in Taiwan: Significant Academic Importance

Bi Qingchang, Director of the Taiwan Geological Survey

The Geological Society of China will hold its 23rd annual meeting in Taipei, Taiwan, starting on November 18th. The first three days will be a conference for papers, with over a hundred papers to be presented on geology, mineralogy, petrology, stratigraphy, and paleontology. Afterwards, daily field trips will be taken to Wulai, Shanzijiao, and Datun near Taipei to study the unique strata of Taiwan. Finally, groups will visit the Miaoli oil fields and the Jinguashi mine for two days each of investigation. The Geological Society of China was established twenty-five years ago and is one of the oldest academic organizations in our country. Furthermore, because its activities have never been interrupted in the past twenty-five years, it truly demonstrates the continuous progress of geological research in China. This time, holding its meeting in Taiwan, from a national perspective, it is the first annual meeting of a national academic organization after the restoration; from Taiwan's perspective, it is the first geological society annual meeting, both before and after the restoration, because Japan has never held such a large-scale conference here. Now, over eighty geological workers are gathering, some of whom have come from as far as Beijing, Lanzhou, and Guangzhou. The topics of the papers cover all branches of geology, and the research objects are located throughout the country. This is truly an unprecedented academic gathering on the island!

The reason why the Geological Society of China chose Taiwan as the location for its annual meeting has its special significance. To understand that the special significance is not just for sightseeing, we should first understand some of the geological characteristics of Taiwan and mainland China. The geological record preserved on mainland China is extremely rich and relatively complete: from the oldest Precambrian period to the early Mesozoic, countless marine and terrestrial changes and vicissitudes are clearly discernible. However, since the middle Mesozoic era, the continental crust has gradually become stable: Shenzhou will never sink. Although each subsequent period also has well-developed strata as its representative, there has been no large-scale marine sedimentation, especially in the later Cenozoic era, there are only relatively shallow red strata representing basins. But during this period when sedimentation on mainland China was gradually declining, the southern edge of the Eurasian continent was undergoing the largest sedimentation. This zone stretches from Southern Europe in the west, through Asia Minor, Iran, India, Myanmar, the South Pacific islands, to Taiwan in the east, giving rise to the majestic Alps, Himalayas, and Taiwan mountains that stand on this zone today. Through the restoration of Taiwan, the geological history of China has finally been completed by recovering this wonderful page that had been lost! We now have Tertiary marine strata, and these strata helped coal and oil return to the motherland together. Indeed, for the Chinese geologists who have gone through eight years of bitter fighting and finally returned our rivers and mountains, there is double the joy and sorrow among the 400 million compatriots! This time they are meeting in Taiwan to rush to read this large article that has returned to the territory, so dozens of people have gathered upon hearing the news, all eager to see it first. The places they will visit are very different from those arranged on the itineraries of ordinary visitors to Taiwan: this can explain their intentions.

In addition to the deposition of strata, Taiwan is also of the first importance in the world in terms of tectonic structure. Vertically, it is the link between the Ryukyu arc and the Luzon arc; horizontally, it is the boundary between the largest continent and the largest ocean; more comprehensively, combining the vertical and horizontal aspects, it is the junction of the world's two major tectonic zones (the Pacific Ring of Fire and the Mediterranean belt), which are characterized by the concentration of earthquakes and volcanic activity. This "strategic" position has made Taiwan a "fortress" in the world's tectonic structure. Being in it, you really feel that every detail has its profound meaning. For this reason alone, it is worth for geologists to come from thousands of miles away. As for Taiwan itself, the structure is also extremely complex; the large-scale inversion and thrust faults swept from the depths of the geosyncline are the same type as those seen in the Alps, which is a holy place in structural geology. These are also difficult to see on mainland China, where basement folds are the main type of large structure. In addition, Taiwan also has several kinds of underground resources, and geologists are certainly more concerned than others about their value among Chinese people. Therefore, in a short period of time, they do not hesitate to spend two days each on the Miaoli oil fields and the Jinguashi mine.

Taiwan has been restored for two full years, and many people have come here during the two years. We dare not say how much they have done to help the Taiwanese compatriots who have been separated for a long time to re-understand the motherland. Therefore, the members of the Geological Society of China who come to Taiwan this time also have another great responsibility invisibly. We believe that they will definitely be able to complete this responsibility with a new look and a fact that moves people's feelings. (November 15th at the Taiwan Geological Survey)

### Not Yet Time to Open Free Foreign Exchange: Stabilization Fund to Be Reorganized, Focusing on "Stabilization" Work to Meet Actual Needs

[Our Newspaper Nanjing, 17th Dispatch] There were previous rumors that the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee would be abolished, but relevant parties have not acknowledged this. However, according to financial circles, the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee will be reorganized into the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Committee. Since the establishment of the Stabilization Fund Committee, the "funds" it holds are insufficient to achieve a stabilization effect. Those in charge have repeatedly suggested reorganizing it, and after many discussions, this decision was made.

[Central News Agency, This City Dispatch] Regarding the rumor that the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee was abolished, the reporter made a special visit to the relevant authorities on the 17th. It was said that nothing had been heard, and the current foreign exchange stabilization policy is proceeding according to the original plan. There is no change whatsoever.

[Another News] The once fluctuating finance and prices have stabilized in recent days as a result of the authorities' proper measures to control the situation with calmness. However, yesterday it was rumored that the three major figures in finance will travel to the United States together within a few days, but the results of inquiries all indicated that nothing had been heard.

[United News Agency Dispatch] According to Shen Xirui, director of the Business Bureau of the Central Bank and member of the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Committee, the rumor that the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee is about to be abolished has been proven untrue by Nanjing. At present, all foreign exchange stabilization policies are proceeding according to the original plan, without any changes. Regarding the proposal of free foreign exchange, Shen believes that it is not a fundamental solution. Because after the implementation of free foreign exchange, it cannot be guaranteed whether the black market will disappear due to supply and demand, and whether exports can improve as ideally as possible. Nowadays, people generally like to pursue the new, and after each method is implemented, they feel it is wrong and advocate reform. After the reform, problems arise again, and they can never be satisfied. I still agree with change, and free foreign exchange is not impossible, but whether it is suitable for needs after another change is quite a problem. What the government hopes for today is a long-term and thorough plan in order to maintain it permanently. Freedom should have conditions and limitations, not like a wild horse, let it run freely.

### Sudden Opening Has Greater Impact

[China Economic News Agency] Recently, there have been widespread rumors that the government will consider conditionally opening free foreign exchange. Yesterday, according to an authoritative figure in the economic and financial circles of this city, this is the speculation of general merchants. In fact, foreign exchange control is still better than opening today. At present, the market price of foreign exchange differs greatly from the listed price in Hong Kong. If free foreign exchange is suddenly opened, the price of foreign exchange will jump and rise a lot, which is enough to stimulate prices and affect people's livelihoods. Under the control of foreign exchange, people know that privately operating and buying and selling foreign exchange is an illegal act, and they dare not trade openly. On the contrary, the increase in transactions after opening is inevitable. Moreover, opening free foreign exchange has problems with politics and society. It should be opened in a stable situation so as not to have other effects. At present, it can only continue to be controlled. However, in the control, several major items should be determined, such as encouraging exports and striving for overseas remittances, and the government should provide flexible methods to make them have reasonable transactions to balance foreign exchange revenue and expenditure.

### Even If Foreign Exchange Control is Abolished, Import and Export Industries Are Not Optimistic

Regarding the change of foreign exchange control policy, the abolition of the current foreign exchange market price and stabilization fund, and the change to a free foreign exchange trade policy, it has been rumored in the market recently. Although the relevant parties have repeatedly denied it, the rumor became even more intense in the market yesterday. A reporter from the Shenzhou News Agency made separate visits to import and export giants who have a close relationship with this matter, and the combined opinions are as follows: The current foreign exchange control policy cannot only eliminate the black market, but on the contrary, because the difference between the black market and the market price is so large that overseas remittances are evaded and exports are difficult, it is indeed necessary to improve it. If the current control policy is immediately changed to a free foreign exchange trade policy, the consequence will inevitably stimulate a further surge in export materials and foreign exchange, leading to a general rise in prices. Overseas remittances may therefore be able to obtain a small number of returns, and the export industry will still fall into a higher predicament. In order for the government to balance the foreign exchange fund and facilitate the entire import and export business, and at the same time eliminate the foreign exchange black market, there is only the implementation of an import and export linking system. Under the principle that the government does not supply foreign exchange, exports are used to balance imports of foreign exchange. At the same time, the government can stipulate that a certain percentage of export foreign exchange should be used for imports, and the balance can be purchased by the government at the market price. In this way, the government's foreign exchange fund can gradually become abundant, and the import and export business of the people can become more active. As for the black market, because its needs are reduced, it can also disappear gradually.

### Government Bonds Decline, Foreign Stocks Rise

Government bonds declined yesterday. Tongbing opened at 22,000 yuan in the morning. They were sold to 21,300 yuan at Room 360. There were purchases at a low price at Room 628 and then it stabilized slightly. As a result, compared with last Saturday, Jia and Yi bonds fell by 600 yuan, Tongbing dropped by 200 yuan, Tongding fell by 900 yuan, Tongwu fell by 500 yuan, and the turnover was about 5 million.

The buying of foreign stocks expanded yesterday. Investors took advantage of the reorganization of various companies to repeatedly compete for purchases. Yisha started from 248,000 yuan in the morning and rose to more than 285,000 yuan at the end. Hong Kong Shen fell to five yuan and some cents. Money exchange helpers sold a lot, while Guangbang foreign firms bought. As a result, compared with last Saturday, Yisha paper version and Xiangtai each rose by 20%, shipping and Yinglian Ken Zhi rose by 50%, Yipi steel industry trams telephone industry rose by 10%, and Jardine Matheson rose by half a percent.

### Chinese Stocks are in Strong Demand, Meiya and Other Stocks are Hitting Limit Up

Foreign stocks were extremely profitable, and rumors of margin deductions rose again, and they stepped up to a high price of 313 yuan for immediate delivery and 318 yuan for deferred delivery.

The midday closing was 308 yuan and 312 yuan, and the shouts were slightly lower after the closing. Meiya rose more, and the rest were just stable. As a result, compared with last Saturday, Meiya alone rose by 50%, and Yongsha Huaxin Chanbei Xinhuo Hua Feng Xinguang Jingfu Zhongfa Xinyi underwear Zhongs Datong Tongyi Zhongfang Rongfeng all rose slightly, and Qin Xing Xinhua Firecrackers fell slightly, and Jinglun Yonggong was still level. According to the deferred delivery stocks, Meiya rose by 50%, Qin Xing was still level, and the remaining stocks rose slightly.

Aftermarket

It looked good at first, but because there was supply at high prices, the current and deferred Yongsha both fell back to 308 yuan. Although the National Bank's exchange had a difference, it still pulled up to 320 yuan and 324 yuan, and fell back five or six yuan. Meiya's immediate delivery, Yongye and Zhabei all hung limit up, and Jinglun Wuhe Zhongfang also forced to rise to the limit in the chaos and closed the market. Xinyi also rose rapidly, and when Yongsha rose to a high price of 328 yuan for immediate delivery and 330 yuan for deferred delivery, it was sold strongly, and then closed at a price of 327 yuan and 329 yuan. As a result, compared with the morning closing, Meiya Zhongfang Jinglun Wuhe Yongye's immediate delivery stocks hit limit up, and Zhabei rose slightly after hitting limit up, rising by half a percent. Qinxing rose by 10%, Yongsha Xinyi Huaxin Xinguang Jingfu Huafeng firecrackers underwear each rose by half a percent, Xinyi was flat, and the rest rose slightly. According to the deferred delivery stocks, Dongxing rose by 10%, and the rest rose by half a percent.

### The China Trust Will Resume Allocation of Artificial Silk; Yesterday, Weaving Factories Registered; Market Conditions Are Stable on Average, Factory Businesses Are Slightly Soft

[Report from Our Newspaper] The China Trust Bureau's artificial silk allocation was temporarily suspended due to the non-arrival of bartered goods from Japan. It is now learned that more than 2,000 boxes of artificial silk have already departed from Japan for Shanghai. The China Trust Bureau plans to resume allocation and began registering silk weaving factories yesterday.

Social Affairs Bureau Reviews Factory Rosters

The Social Affairs Bureau is extremely dissatisfied with the Central Trust Bureau's method of allocating artificial silk to various silk-weaving factories in this city. Factories that need the silk do not receive enough, while some with larger quotas do not actually manufacture, leading to the phenomenon of silk flowing into the black market. As a result, the Central Trust Bureau has not yet allocated artificial silk and is studying ways to improve the process. The Central Trust Bureau recently sent the list of factories receiving allocations to the Social Affairs Bureau for review. After review, the Social Affairs Bureau found inaccuracies in the listed production equipment of some factories and is continuing its review. However, the Social Affairs Bureau still hopes that the Central Trust Bureau will send personnel to conduct actual investigations.

Furthermore, the artificial silk market was quite stable yesterday morning. Although the opening price was soft, the closing price was similar to that of last weekend. In the afternoon, due to the rise in the stock market, people's spirits were lifted, and the final price was 3 million yuan higher than last weekend. No. 120 Asahi Brand Bright Silk opened at 2 million yuan in the morning and closed at 3 million yuan for immediate delivery and 4 million yuan for deferred delivery. In the afternoon, the final price was 7 million yuan, and 4A Toyo Silk approached 90 million yuan.

Raw Silk

Yesterday's market was slightly weak. Although the asking price for Five Bale Head silk remained unchanged, there were basically no transactions. Superior grade silk opened at 67 million yuan, and medium grade silk opened at 66 million yuan, both down 1 million yuan from last weekend. Due to the rise in domestic silk, the Shanghai market became firm and expensive. The price of top grade silk remained around 50 million yuan.

Silk Fabrics

Yesterday's market was firm and stable. Dachen and Huaqiang real silk quilts opened at 4.5 million yuan and saw transactions. Subsequently, due to short sellers buying to cover their positions, the market rose, reaching a high of 5.1 million yuan for immediate delivery, then retreated to between 4.9 million yuan for immediate delivery and 5 million yuan for deferred delivery. At the close, the price was 4.85 million yuan for immediate delivery and 4.95 million yuan for deferred delivery. Meiya goods were around 5.1 million yuan for immediate delivery, with very few transactions. Prices for other factory goods remained largely unchanged: Huajin crepe was 60,000 yuan, Minsheng floral crepe was 72,000 yuan, and Lin Ji wax-printed gauze was 68,000 yuan. Due to the high price of domestic silk, the cost of Dawei woolen fabric from Huzhou increased sharply, so the Shanghai market price per yard reached around 130,000 to 140,000 yuan.

### Credit Tightening

Furthermore, in order to strengthen market control and bring buying and selling into order, the Social Affairs Bureau previously convened a discussion meeting of responsible persons from the miscellaneous grain and rice industries to explain the meaning of regional and group liaison management and control, and to review the direction of promoting various industries, which achieved great results. The bureau is continuing to convene discussion meetings of various industries. The schedule is as follows: 4:00 PM on the 25th of this month, a discussion meeting for the flour industry; 2:00 PM on the 27th of this month, a discussion meeting for oil pressing plants; 2:00 PM on the 28th of this month, a discussion meeting for wholesale oil merchants; 2:00 PM on the 29th of this month, a discussion meeting for retail oil merchants.

As a result, Category B (yarn number) dealers are currently not allocated yarn temporarily.

Cotton Yarn

Yesterday's cotton yarn market saw firm sentiment at the opening due to the opening price of Fangjian Company being similar to the previous period. Local and out-of-town merchants had some demand, and the market gradually rose. Subsequently, due to tightening credit, fewer buyers entered the market, and some small sellers released their holdings, causing the market to decline slightly. As a result, 42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn rose 300,000 yuan compared to Saturday, to 39.8 million yuan. 20-count Double Horse yarn also rose 300,000 yuan, and 16-count Guangming yarn rose 400,000 yuan.

Serge and Yuanzhigong cloth fell by 10,000 to 40,000 yuan due to a large supply from Fangjian. Shilin cloth and high-grade Tingshiu cloth rose 45,000 yuan. The market sentiment for other cloths also tended to be firm.

Light woolens are popular in brown, while heavy woolens in brown are slow-moving. Although the price per yard is 100,000 yuan cheaper, there are still few buyers.

### Domestic Tea Stable and Selling Well

Since the shift to main selling intention for red and green teas, the market supply has been scarce. Exports have very little appetite from exporters, and are still seeking low prices. Therefore, the process has tended to be mutually exclusive, and the market is quiet and unchanging. Other domestic colored teas are still being actively sought by buyers due to continued sales from local stores and shops, so the situation continues to be stable and selling well.

French North Africa Purchases Our Green Tea

According to tea industry sources: Yesterday, 950 tons of green tea were traded at a price of US$0.90 per kilogram. This was negotiated and traded by the French economic mission and will be shipped to North Africa. This should be one of the largest recent green tea shipments. However, since it must be shipped out tomorrow, the tea merchants who took over this transaction are all busy packing and loading overnight.

Furthermore, according to tea industry insiders, the quality of Chinese green tea is good. It only needs to be improved technically using scientific methods, and exports are not hopeless. However, falling prices in the international market and rising prices in the domestic market in recent years are major difficulties for tea exports.

### A Cat's Paradise

— By Émile Zola, translated by Bi Xiu Shao

After an aunt passed away, she left me an Angora cat, the most stupid animal I have ever known. Look, here's the story it told me one winter night in front of the hot fireplace.

One

I was two years old then, and I was indeed the fattest and most innocent cat one could see. At such a young age, I also had the conceit to enjoy the warmth of the fireplace, which ordinary animals would disdain. Oh, how I should thank God for placing me in your aunt's house! The brave woman loved me very much. In the depths of the closet, I had a real bedroom, a feather cushion. The food was as comfortable as the bedroom; never bread or soup, only meat, good meat with blood still flowing.

But in these gentle moments, I had only one wish, one dream, to slip out of the half-open window and escape onto the roof. Stroking seemed too boring to me, and the softness of the bed simply disgusted me. I lived so happily every day that it finally bored me.

I should tell you that I could see the opposite rooftop from the window when I stretched my neck. That day, four cats were fighting, their fur standing on end, their tails high, happily rolling on the blue-stone tiles in the sunlight. I had never seen such a strange sight before. From then on, my faith was firm. True happiness is on the roof, outside the windows that people so carefully close. What convinced me was that people always close the cabinet doors that contain fresh meat so carefully.

I decided on a plan to escape. In life, there must be something besides fresh meat dripping with blood. This is the "unknown," the ideal. One day, people forgot to push the kitchen window closed, and I jumped onto the small roof below.

Two

How beautiful the roof was! The eaves, set on their edges, emitted a sweet fragrance. I happily followed these eaves forward, my feet sinking into the soft, infinitely gentle mud. It was like walking on velvet. The sun scattered such good heat that it almost melted the fat on my body.

I won't hide it from you, my limbs were trembling. My joy was mixed with terror. I especially remember a terrible feeling that almost made me fall into the street. Three cats rolling on the ridge of the roof shouted terribly and ran to my side. When they saw me about to faint, they scolded me as a stupid fatso, and they told me they were just shouting for fun. I also started meowing like them. It was very interesting. They were lively animals without my stupid fat. They mocked my clumsiness as I slid like a ball of fat on the sun-baked lead panels. One of the old tomcats was especially fond of me. He voluntarily offered to serve me and take responsibility for my education, which I gratefully accepted.

Ah! Your aunt's pampering was far away! I drank water in the eaves, and never had milk with sugar tasted so sweet to me. Everything seemed very good and kind to me. A female cat, a melodious one, whose beautiful appearance filled me with unprecedented emotion, appeared. Until then, only my dreams had shown me that these wonderful creatures had lovely, soft spines. My three companions and I ran to greet her. Before them, I wanted to express my welcome to the lovely female cat, but one of my companions bit my neck fiercely. I immediately let out a cry of pain.

"Forget it!" said the old tomcat, dragging me away. "You will see many other female cats."

Three

After walking for an hour, I felt very hungry.

"What do you eat on the roof?" I asked my friend, the old tomcat.

"We eat what we can find," he replied scholastically.

This answer made me a little bewildered because I searched in vain and couldn't find anything. Finally, I saw a young female worker in the attic preparing her lunch. On the table by the window was a piece of good, blood-red rib meat that made my mouth water.

"Look, my problem is solved," I thought very naively.

I jumped onto the table and grabbed the rib meat. But the female worker saw me and hit me terribly on the back with a broom handle. I let go of the rib meat and fled with a horrible cry.

"So," you must have come from the countryside!" said the old tomcat to me. "The meat on the table is not for us to eat. We can only think about it from afar. We have to look for our food in the eaves."

I could never understand why the meat in the kitchen didn't belong to cats. My stomach had begun to rumble seriously. The old tomcat told me that I had to wait until night, which finally disappointed me greatly. When night came, we could jump into the street and search through the garbage piles everywhere. Wait until night! He uttered this calmly, like an experienced philosopher! As for me, I felt like I was going to faint at the thought of this prolonged fast.

Four

Night came slowly, a foggy night that made me cold. Soon, it started raining again, fine, bone-chilling rain, blown by the fierce wind. We went down through the glass window of a staircase. The street looked so ugly to me! It was no longer the warm heat, the big sun, the bright white roof where everyone could roll so happily. My feet slipped on the wet stone street. I painfully recalled my three-layer quilt and my feather cushion.

As soon as we got to the street, my friend, the old tomcat, began to tremble. He shrank very small, running insidiously along the houses, and told me to hurry and follow him. When he encountered a gate accessible to carriages, he quickly hid there and uttered a satisfied purr. When I asked him why he ran away like that, he replied:

"Did you see that man with the basket on his back and a small hook in his hand?"

"I did."

"Well—if he sees us, he will kill us and roast us on an iron bar!"

"Roast us on an iron bar!" I shouted. "Then the street doesn't belong to us either? Not only do we have nothing to eat, but we will be eaten by people?"

Five

However, people dumped garbage in front of the doors. I searched the piles of filth in disappointment. I found two or three lean bones buried in the dirty ashes. From then on, I understood how tasty fresh beef and mutton lungs were! My friend, the old tomcat, swept the garbage with an artistic flair. He made me run straight until morning, visiting every street without any hurry. For almost ten hours, I was battered by the rain, and my whole body trembled. Cursed street; cursed freedom! How much I regretted my prison!

After dawn, the old tomcat saw me faltering and asked me in a strange tone:

"Have you had enough?"

"Oh! Yes," I replied.

"Would you like to go back to your home?"

"Of course, but how can I go back?"

"Come on. Yesterday morning, when I saw you come out, I knew that a fat cat like you was not born to enjoy the spicy pleasures of freedom. I know your house, I'll take you to your door."

This venerable old tomcat said this to me so simply. When we arrived:

"Farewell," he said goodbye to me without showing any emotion.

"No," I shouted, "we can't leave like this. You come with me. We will share the same bed and the same meat. My mistress is a good woman..."

He didn't let me finish.

"Please shut your mouth!" he said suddenly. "You are a fool. I would die in your gentleness. Your abundant life is indeed very good for newborn cats. Free cats will never buy your meaty lungs and your feather cushions at the price of prison... Farewell."

He jumped back onto his roof. I watched his large, thin silhouette, caressed by the rising sun, shivering comfortably.

After I got home, your aunt picked up the duster and beat me heavily, and I happily accepted this deserved punishment. I comfortably savored the warmth and the pleasure of being beaten, and as she whipped me, I sweetly thought of the fresh meat she would let me devour.

Six

"You see," my cat said as if concluding, stretching his body in front of the coals, "true happiness—paradise, my dear master, is being locked in a house with meat, even being beaten is happy."

I am speaking for the cat.

### Sketches of the Yellow River Flood Area

— Li Dinglong

### Notes on Viewing Dinglong's Giant Painting

— Zhu Jiu

Recently, I went to an art tea party and unexpectedly met Mr. Li Dinglong. After ten years of separation and chaos, we reunited at once, and my heart was filled with comfort beyond words. When I saw the many paintings brought by Mr. Li, I couldn't help but be amazed. During these ten years, he was able to uphold his artistic interests, strive diligently, travel through hardships, and endure hardships, thereby obtaining unexpected gains and achievements, which was by no means accidental. Therefore, I would like to introduce his proud masterpiece to fellow enthusiasts.

(1) "Thousand Chariots and Ten Thousand Horses": Measuring over ten *zhang* in length, this extremely complex scene depicts the life of more than ten kinds of people, including border compatriots, Kazakhs, Mongolians, Manchus, Tibetans, and Uyghurs, as well as the martial spirit of horse racing, with fluent and skilled techniques, leaving nothing unportrayed. The authenticity of the subject matter and the novelty of the painting show his ingenuity.

(2) "Traces of the Gan River": Approximately seven *zhang* in length, this work reflects the author's experience of the wonders and dangers of the mountains and rivers, and the thorns and thistles of the world, all contained in his heart, expressed with deep emotion, and released from his brush tip and splashed onto the plain silk, seemingly harboring the desire to purify the turbid world.

(3) "Yellow River Flood": This entire area measures over 260 square feet, over ten *zhang* in length. When the Yellow River breached its banks in the 27th year, Mr. Li went to the flood area to sketch on the spot, without fear of hardship. Such a giant work depicting the flood is of the same value as the "Refugee Map" of the rural knights.

(4) "Land of Ultimate Bliss": This painting measures over 400 square feet. Mr. Li spent nine months meticulously copying the Sui and Tang dynasty murals in the Mogao Caves in Dunhuang, and the organization and composition of the painting are based on the author's own ideas.

(5) "Phoenix Ceremony": This is an organization of various birds from Mr. Li's sketches, which is particularly unique. The total area is also over 200 square feet.

### An Inch of Mountain, an Inch of White

— Ye Jingfeng

I thought of this mysterious whistle, so I asked Yaoqun if it was used to transmit alarms.

"You've guessed only a small part." Yaoqun laughed this time; probably finding my expression too surprised and nervous, she found it amusing.

"A small part?" I immediately developed an interest in researching it.

"Actually, it's not some amazing new invention," Yaoqun gradually stopped smiling; "Rather than a new invention, it's more like a 'revival'... It's a pity there isn't much time to talk, they might be coming soon..."

"It's okay, at worst..." I couldn't wait, indicating that I wanted Yaoqun to explain this thing, even if just briefly.

Seeing my eagerness for this communication method, Yaoqun asked me, "Do you know that we have a nearly lost vocalization technique?"

"I can't recall it for the moment." I searched my barren mind for a while.

"Whistling: Do you know it?" Yaoqun asked me. Without waiting for me to answer, she continued.

It turned out that the antique dealer, Master Shan, in Laocha outside the pass, had a belly full of the three religions and nine streams of thought (as mentioned before). It was this old antique dealer who taught Yaoqun more than ten kinds of whistling methods. As for the new and old knowledge Yaoqun absorbed, there was quite a lot. She combined the principle of short waves with a type of whistling called "Little Submersion."

According to the whistling score, the "Little Submersion" method "uses the outer tongue to excite, suppress the breath, causing it to rise upward... Because it belongs to yin, the sound is like a ghost's voice, like a dragon's roar... The further away, the more intense..."

"Actually, it's very simple," Yaoqun, seeing that I seemed somewhat unclear, added some explanation: "Good actors in Peking opera are good at using the 'back-of-the-head sound,' you probably know that? The so-called back-of-the-head sound is a kind of sound that is inaudible up close, but becomes clearer the further away... The 'Little Submersion' whistling method is also like that..."

"But just now, when Little Tiger was startled and jumped up, I didn't hear any sound..." I still didn't understand the principle of this mysterious sound transmission.

"The advantage lies in this point." The two small dimples on the corners of Yaoqun's mouth reappeared, indicating a trace of得意得意: a little得意得意的神情:"But the difficulty also lies in this point..."

Yaoqun paused here, as if trying to figure out what words and methods to use to explain this mysterious sound transmission thing simply and clearly: "You know that the strength of the shortwave whistle is that it makes human earwaves unable to feel perception, in other words, it makes people unable to see it, whether nearby or far away. You understand that point, right?...”

Of course I understood this point, so I nodded as a sign, afraid that if I spoke, I would divert Yaoqun's train of thought to other topics.

"Conversely," Yaoqun also nodded, responding to my answer: "The sound of whistling can be heard no matter how far or near; however, it decreases when close by, and becomes more intense the further away. You probably understand that point too?" Yaoqun paused again, meaning to give me time to understand; at the same time, she wanted to get my reply.

Shi Chongpeng's Painting Inscription

Landscape - Shen Yinmo

The recluse sadly makes friends with the mountains,
The forests are lush and the artistic conception is new;
A breeze comes through the broken pavilion, knowing there are bamboos,
The flowing water crosses the bridge, not encountering dust.

Landscape Horizontal Scroll - Bai Jiao

The light returns with the setting sun, and the ten peaks are also illuminated,
The air turns with the fiery atmosphere, and ten thousand acres of autumn;
Huangshan's pines have been eternally old,
White clouds hang and waterfalls flow leisurely together.

The landscape scenery resembles Longzhong,
With a thoughtful old man hugging his knees;
Who can come here?
Following the gentle breeze with sails to the horizon.

Ink Orchid - Ma Gongyu

Late autumn contains frost and dew,
Pure fragrance is naturally lofty,
A thousand-year gentleman's pendant,
Read Li Sao in the slanting sun. The dew is moist in the quiet courtyard, The secluded淡澹 is suitable for碧玉Jade branches; Since Qu Ping left for exile, Only the fragrant grass and美人思 remain.

Preface to Ink Bamboo - Chen Dingshan

Brother Chongpeng is a senior disciple of Mr. Hengyang, and his painting of bamboo combines elegance with strength, earning him high praise. I asked for an inscription of a quatrain, please correct it.

A branch of bamboo on the Pure Thought Tower,
The Xiao sparsely reveals the time of surpassing the blue;
When discussing the rest of the people after the Song and Yuan dynasties,
Only then do I believe that Zhuang Sheng is the master of transformation.

### Marriage Journey

— Sun Yuehan

Fierce as a tiger, rapid as the tide;
A burst of noise passes over the painted bridge.
Vermilion faces unfold into cherry-like mouths,
碧玉 jade hands lightly lift willow waists.
Among them, a person sits by the bridge,
Blood flows all over the ground, his head broken.
His teeth are knocked out, unable to speak,
In October, he only wears a pair of underwear.
Turning around, his roots touch the riverbank,
Passersby whisper the story to me;
This is an old master of a wealthy family,
His wife is out of favor and has no home to return to.
Back then, his spirit was as strong as clouds,
Leather shoes and foreign clothes, standing out from the crowd.
He squandered gold like dirt,
His affections turned towards pomegranate skirts.
When they met in the silk pavilion and red building,
The green willows beside the road became a mess of silk.
Even if only half a face is glimpsed,
It makes scholars think all night.
The young lady's residence is lonely,
Who can she tell her idle sorrows and quiet complaints to?
Her eyes already become媚波 with just a逗laugh,
Before the oriole language is spoken, her heart has already agreed,
The wedding candles burn high in the noisy bridal chamber,
含情 love and affection, she calls him "郞 Lang."
美蓉 is warmer and more delicate than Yun膩 silk,
How can righteousness be as warm as fragrant Rain is cool.
They fly together like 比目, advancing to the branches,
With one heart and one life, they say joyful words;
Dreaming of butterflies and mandarin ducks,
I, I, you, you, parrot poems.
Who knows that good things are often磨折磨折 setbacks,
Past romances melt like ice and snow.
A sickness turns him into a瘦生太 skinny student.
A hundred years from now, he will be伤離別 injured by parting.
After the illness, he becomes more haggard and even poorer,
He wants to end his life in this world.
Husband and wife meet like strangers,
A pitiful person who eats wind and sleeps in the dew.
He crawls along the street in the bitter dusk,
Raising his eyes, he is desolate and alone.
Exhausted, he stands under the eaves,
A copper iron ruler comes out of the heavy door.
I heard this matter and sighed three times,
Marriage is mostly like a trade.
Only with milk can you be亲親亲親亲亲亲亲亲亲親亲dear;
Without money,滚你媽的蛋 fuck your mother!

### The Honest and Upright Minister - Lu Xuangong, the Anti-Corruption Advocate

— Tang Shan

In our country's past dynasties, many court officials, like Cai Jing and Qin Hui, relied on power and status to embezzle and bend the law. But there were also many who were honest and upright. These officers of integrity and self-respect could not be moved by gold and silver, nor could they be turned from their steadfast will by favor or grace. They were dutiful and law-abiding to superiors, and did not commit the slightest offense against inferiors.

Lu Zhi (Lu Xuangong) of the Tang Dynasty, who served as a Hanlin scholar, was very favored by the Emperor. Emperor Dezong knew that he was honest and poor, and issued a secret edict, suggesting that he might as well earn some extra money. The imperial envoy who delivered the secret edict said to him: "The Emperor knows that you are too honest and accustomed to poverty. You have refused the things sent to you by various places. If you don't accept large amounts of wealth, it doesn't matter if you accept some things like whips." Lu Xian not only "dared not obey the edict," but also sternly submitted a memorial, saying that "Your Majesty is concerned about matters that are not 通通, which is contrary to reason." The public declared in the memorial entitled "Thanks for the Secret Edict and Discussion of the Proclaimed Matters":

"The clerks and petty officials, slightly escaped corruption, if they violate the Dao, I would know gradually; how about the 公卿公卿大臣 and the 方岳岳岳連帥? How can they be loyal only by bribery? If they are close to the enemy because of the love of wealth and benefit, and can be patient and kind. If we violate the straight way, there must be excessive desires; if we follow it, the laws and regulations will gradually fall, and if we obstruct it, hope will become even greater. The country can rely on it? … …凡上 之 為, 以 導 下 也; 上 所 不 為, 以 檢 下 也. If the superior does not do it, and the inferior does it, then they can set up strict defenses and direct the law. If the superior does it, and the inferior also does it, it is their reason, and can they be prohibited? … …若大臣 邇 臣 可以 受 財, 則 麻 長 案 寮 孰 為 不 可以? If the court takes it from the 方鎭, the 方鎭 takes it from the 州, the 州 takes it from the 縣, the 縣 takes it from the 鄉, then what will the 鄉 take? Once the way of bribery is opened, it will become more and more rampant, not only whips, but also clothes; not only clothes, but also silk; not only silk, but also chariots; not only chariots, but also gold and jade. Seeing what can be desired every day, how can they restrain themselves in their hearts? Once they have a private relationship, it is difficult to sever their intentions. Therefore, the flow does not stop, and the stream of hope becomes a disaster; once a slight difference is made, the hills and mountains gather resentment. How many countries have perished in the past?

I would like to excerpt this large section of the memorial. I feel that these honest words are like a檄文 for the corrupt officials of today. It is not enough for officials to embezzle and bend the law. Even accepting gifts from the people is worthy of consideration. Today's high-ranking officials receive gifts in one place and in another. This is still a变相变相的贪污, because this effect is either媚上媚上 to superiors or褶于威仪. As parents of the people, they receive government salaries and have all the rights. If it is said that "whips" can be accepted, then "gold and jade" will inevitably be rejected. True honesty and integrity must not take anything that is not due to them.

### Talking About Cranes

— Guangyi

There are many kinds of cranes, but the most rare and valuable is the red-crowned crane. Its whole body is covered with pure white feathers, and there is a tuft of red hair on its head. It is more than three feet tall, with a long beak and head. It likes to eat fish, has large wings and flies quickly, and its call is loud and clear. The Book of Poetry says: "The crane cries in the nine marshes, and its voice is heard in the sky," which shows that the crane's call is loud and clear. It is produced in the three northeastern provinces and Siberia, and migrates to temperate areas in winter and returns to its old land in spring, so the crane is a migratory bird.

Recently (October 2), a red-crowned crane was captured by villagers in Daliang Township, Shunde, Guangdong. Unfortunately, it was injured and died. There was a small copper tag tightly on its foot, with the words "Great Ming Hongwu Liberation of Life" written on it. The handwriting was very faint and could only be recognized after careful identification. It is estimated that the age of this crane is already more than five hundred and eighty years old. Lu Ji's poetry commentary says, "The crane lives for a thousand years." Our human life span is no more than a hundred years. It is impossible to 武断武断地确定 whether the crane's life span can reach more than a thousand years. However, this crane proves that it has lived for more than five hundred and eighty years, which can be said to be long-lived. Today, people celebrate their birthdays and call them "Crane Calculation," and many people like to name them after cranes, such as "Crane Year" and "Crane Age," all hoping to have the same long life as the crane.

I like cranes, I like the 清遠 清遠 and leisurely freedom of European cranes, and I especially like its purity that transcends the outside of產埃埃 outside产埃 so some people compare cranes to virtuous gentlemen and reclusive scholars. When it逍遥在逍遥在问 asking questions for answers, it is carefree in the 青山青山 green water, or soaring in the blue sky and clouds, or standing in the rice fields by the mountainside to peck at food. What悠开自得悠开自得得悠开自得! At the same time, I want to grieve for the cranes that are imprisoned in the cages of animal solids and have lost their freedom. As for the crane that was captured in Shunde, it is unfortunate that it died due to injury. Burning a zither and boiling a crane is too煞风景煞风景 and damages雅雅. Originally, the elegant story of "plum wife and crane son" has been a beautiful story of the past for a long time. What's more, in these turbulent years, no one has such闲情逸致闲情逸致.

### Important Question

— Hesheng

A child was suffering from a very severe toothache, which often made him unable to sleep peacefully at night, and the sound of his crying really bothered the other people in the family. His father decided to take him to the dentist to have his teeth pulled out. After several persuasions, the child finally agreed. After examining him, the dentist saw that five teeth had been蛀坏蛀坏 destroyed, so he pulled them out one by one. After the surgery, the child felt very strange in his mouth and was very困恼困恼, because he could not chew food. In order to reassure him, the dentist told him that it was okay, and the gums would再生出再生出 to grow. The child heard. He quickly asked, "Can they grow out in time before eating?"

### The Murderous Devil Under Zijin Mountain

— Bao Qing

In the history of the Anti-Japanese War, the Nanjing Massacre case caused the deaths of more than 300,000 Chinese people, with corpses lying everywhere. The tragedy was so terrible that it shocked the world. In particular, the incident of two demons under Zijin Mountain holding a killing competition was shocking. Koshofu, the protagonist of the massacre case, was executed by our military court in March of this year after his trial was completed. And the two murdering devils also had debts that could not be escaped. After we requested their extradition from the Far East Military Tribunal, they were finally escorted to China on the Suihe Shunlun day from Japan. They will be publicly tried in the Nanjing Military Tribunal of the Ministry of National Defense.

The two murdering devils, each Xiangjing Minming and Yetian Yan, were both second lieutenants of the Pianqiri unit at that time. During the battle of Jurong, they held a killing competition and agreed that whoever could personally kill one hundred people before the complete occupation of Nanjing would win the championship. Later, during the battle outside Jurong City, Xiangjing had killed eighty-nine people, and Yetian had killed seventy-eight people. When the two met under Zijin Mountain, Xiangjing had killed one hundred and six people, and Yetian had killed one hundred and five people, but they could not determine who had killed one hundred people first, so the two agreed not to use one hundred people as the standard, but to use one hundred and fifty people as the standard and continue the competition. At this time, Xiangjing's saber had缺口缺口 chipped because he had killed too many people and used too much force.

Xiangjing is a thorough Japanese Bushido-style militarist. He said that the competition was all "fun," and it was very interesting to break records and not know each other. Moreover, he said that when he put this saber on his shoulder, bullets could not hit him. This is simply the devil speaking.

However, the Japanese not only do not regard DaoRen as brutal, inhuman, or disregard international law, but instead pride themselves on Bushido. Initially, a special war correspondent from the Tokyo Daily News reported to the whole country by special telegram, and the Daily News also published photos of the murderous devil, with the headline "Under Zijin Mountain" in front of the telegram. And the Japanese military headquarters not only did not pay attention to the two 纪纪, but also took photos of the killings to show off their military power. In fact, it was undoubtedly縱兵肆虐縱兵肆虐 and planned large-scale massacres in an attempt to destroy our country's spirit of resistance and national consciousness.

### Going Home

— Hengquan

I have been away from my hometown for more than ten years. I am tired of living in the city. The environment in the city is too bad, the air is too dirty, and life is too difficult, so I have no恋恋恋恋.

Let's go home soon! Green mountains and green waters,茅屋蓬户茅屋蓬户, fields and streams, melons, fruits and vegetables, how interesting and fresh! Let's sing Tao Lao's Going Home.

The Japanese寇寇 invades our territory, and my hometown is陷陷. My husband and I扶老携幼扶老携幼 to escape to Shanghai. Counting on my fingers, it has been ten years now. In these ten years, my eldest daughter suffered from heart disease, followed by my old aunt suffering from appendicitis, and then my second and third daughters suffering from hemoptysis at the same time. I have been taking care of her for many years, and I have not been able to安枕安枕 yet. There are still two boys who are studying. My inner pain is truly beyond words.

My family of eight all depends on the price my husband换换 with his heart and blood. In the face of high living costs, coupled with the invasion of illness, people can only徒唤奈何徒唤奈何!

Go back! Go back! The繁华繁华 city is not a place for poor people like me to live.

### The Journey of a Cigar

— Bao Zhongqi

A German luggage porter got a US cigar as a reward for carrying a travel bag for a US officer because the officer didn't have German marks.

The luggage porter, who exchanged labor for food, took the cigar and went to a bakery to exchange it for a loaf of bread with the owner.

Although the cigar was noble, the bakery owner finally avoided its temptation and used it as a price to repair his broken delivery car.

The repair mechanic who repaired the car got the cigar and exchanged it for a new pair of shoes that he had been thinking about day and night.

The shoe salesman exchanged it for eggs at a farmer's house and sent it to his sick brother.

Finally, the farmer was lucky enough to light the cigar. He was the only self-sufficient person and one of the few happy Germans who could enjoy a cigar.

### A Week in the Film Industry

— Li Zhen

"Happiness Rhapsody" Shanghai, the paradise of adventurers, many people rush from different places to Shanghai, which is full of gold. As a result, Shanghai is not the ideal place of gold that they thought, but a city full of fraud, deception, and ugliness. "Happiness Rhapsody" is a script that expresses Shanghai. The playwright brings their dreams of happiness from the characters of Wang Jinfu and Wu Zhihai, a pair of petty citizens. Another Zhang Yuehua is a woman who has been crushed by life, but they all have kind and sincere熟情熟情, so they cannot tolerate this sinful city. In the play, the author writes another rogue character, Jiang Shijie, who represents the dark labor force in this society. In today's rampant rogues, if good people want to survive, they must wait for a true reform of society. Otherwise, at the end, the three of them run away to another place, relying on that set of speculative happiness rhapsody. The result is bound to be a second disappointment.

In today's difficult theme to write, "Happiness Rhapsody" is undoubtedly a good script. Director Chen Liting handled the war very appropriately, always grasping the development of the play, especially the清新格调清新格调, which is his consistent style.

In terms of performance, Gu Eryi is the best. Huang Zongying and Zhao Dan performed very appropriately. Huang's造型造型 is better, and Zhang Ming can be called stable.

The recording of this film is poor.

"Thinking of the Mortal World" Among the Western films this week, "Thinking of the Mortal World" is the best. It depicts the lives of a group of Catholic nuns. The beauty of the photography方面方面 is indeed one of the best among recent British films. Deborah Kerr's nun is the best actor, and Keen Summon's native woman and大术术术德勒德勒De Di恩Di恩 are also satisfactory.

At the end of the film, the male and female protagonists bid farewell to each other in the torrential rain. The melancholy感情感情 shows the director's skill.

"Loose Woman's Infatuation" This is a good Hollywood-style多角恋爱多角恋爱 film, starring Hedy Lamarr. The story顿为平庸顿为平庸. Hai蒂蒂蒂拉玛拉玛 is good in her performance. Yuehan Leide, who plays the jewel merchant, is not weak.

"Spring in the South" With the scenery of South America in Brazil as the background, it is interspersed with South American music and singing as a gimmick. The story is an American-style love story. If you watch too many such films, you will definitely feel厌腻厌腻. Especially in terms of performance, it is simple and lacks excitement.

"Valley Heroes" This film depicts the western film of heroes and beauties. Large groups of horses gallop in the mountains. It is completely粗鑛粗鑛 style, but the technique is too old. It seems to be an outdated work.

### A Sketch of the Kingdom of Yemen

— Gao Ming

——She is a new member of the United Nations

Yemen, a new member of the United Nations, is located at the southern end of the Red Sea, which has been a major sea route for thousands of years. She is a country that relies primarily on trade, but still retains a unique ancient culture in her plateau regions.

Nearly five million people live in the country of 75,000 square miles. It is the most fertile region of Arabia, and in fact is the only part of the Near East with abundant and regular rainfall.

Yemen's current ruler is伊受葉耶伊受葉耶, who is the King of Yemen. He is the spiritual and political leader of the Yemeni people, and he claims to be a descendant of Muhammad's son-in-law, Ali.

In Yemen, there is an area of about 25,000 Jews, and besides Palestine, this is one of the oldest Jewish societies.

The lineage of伊曼葉耶 has continued for more than a thousand years. Beginning in the 16th century, she was under the rule of the Ottoman Empire, and the original ruling class was replaced by the latter. It was not until World War I that the Turks were expelled, and the current伊曼 restored his position as ruler. In 1934, she signed a treaty with Britain, confirming her southern border with Aden; in the same year, in another treaty, she stipulated her northern border with Saudi Arabia. To the east of Yemen is a barren sandy desert, where she has no clear border lines.

In recent years, Yemen has concluded agreements with many countries in trade and other aspects. These countries include Britain, the United States, France, the Soviet Union, Egypt, Belgium, and others. In 1945, she joined the Arab League.

It is said that coffee originated in Yemen. For hundreds of years, Yemen has exported many fine varieties of coffee. Even today, Mocha in her south is a port for coffee exports. As early as the 17th century, the Dutch East India Company had set up a station in "Mocha" to engage in coffee trade. By the 18th century, the word "Mocha," regardless of its origin, was used as a synonym for high-quality coffee in Western Europe.

Coffee, fruit skins, and raisins are the main items exported from 集门 to more distant countries, while cereals are exported to neighboring countries. She is self-sufficient in food. Yemen's famous craftsmen are silversmiths, and sword casting is their specialty. Their works are famous in the East.

Yemen has no railways, but there are highways linking important towns. These highways have been gradually improved, and now cars and camel caravans can pass through them.

Sana is the capital of Yemen, with a population of 60,000, paved with neat streets, surrounded by twenty high and extremely thick city walls, with eight gates running through them.

### Retreating Island

— Gongsun Neng

The United States also has

The Spring and Autumn Annals says: "Six castings retreated and flew, and meteorites fell in Song." In fact, the United States also has this legend.

Kansas, the proudest state in the United States, has a strange story. It is said that there is a Jayhawk in Kansas that can retreat and fly, so it is "无往而不利无往而不利". A historian in the state also researched and said: "This divine bird has protruding eyes, and when it flies, it looks in all directions with one eye."

Believe it or not.

### Shanghai Citizens' Emergency Medical Aid Society - Report on the General Situation of Aid Funds in October

### Shanghai Anti-Tuberculosis Association’s Reply to Tuberculosis Patients

To the correspondent: Your esteemed letter, along with the original letter from Mr. Cui Huimin, have been received and noted with respect. The reply is now provided as follows:

The former Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) Shanghai Branch previously provided skim milk and cod liver oil to our association's First and Second Tuberculosis Hospitals each month for distribution. Monthly reports were prepared and submitted to the branch and the Social Affairs Bureau for record. However, the branch ceased issuing these items from the end of February this year.

Although the UNRRA Shanghai Branch stopped providing these nutritional products from the end of February, our association continued to distribute the remaining skim milk and cod liver oil according to the original plan until they were exhausted.

The skim milk was completely distributed by early October.

There is still some cod liver oil remaining, which is currently being distributed. Each patient receives 45 cc per month, also until the supply is exhausted.

For those requesting cod liver oil, whether new or returning patients, they must still follow the original procedure of personally visiting our hospital's outpatient department for an X-ray examination and must bring their own container.

Outpatient X-ray examinations are subject to fees according to the hospital's regulations, but those who are poor and ill with proper documentation can receive them free of charge.

The UNRRA Shanghai Branch completely ceased its external operations by the end of May.

Last month, the United American Committee for China Relief donated a batch of bulk nonfat dry milk to our association. All tuberculosis patients in our outpatient department can receive two to five pounds free of charge. Respectfully, Huang Jia, Executive Director of the Shanghai Anti-Tuberculosis Association, to the Social Services Section of the Shen Bao Newspaper.
