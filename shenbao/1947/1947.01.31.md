Nationalist Troops Reinforce Baoding from Multiple Directions; Quiet on the Outskirts of Xuzhou; Communist Troops in Adjacent Areas of Jiangsu, Shandong, and Henan Encircled
[Our Newspaper, Peiping, 30th Telegram] Powerful Nationalist troops are reinforcing Baoding on the Ping-Han Railway from Beining and Ping-Sui routes. The Communist troops are doing everything they can to prevent this. Last night, in addition to sabotage between Peiping and Tianjin, several places near the stations of Dingxian, Beihe Village, and Caohe on the Peiping-Baoding line were also destroyed.

[Our Newspaper, Baoding, _ Day Telegram] More than 20,000 Communist troops from Dingxian have returned to western Hebei, and some have moved elsewhere, indicating that a major battle will take place in the Baoding-Shijiazhuang area.

[Our Newspaper, Peiping, _ Day Telegram] There has also been fighting in the northern section of the Jinpu Railway. Three regiments of Communist troops arrived in Beilinzhen, which belongs to Qingxian, on the 28th, and attacked the Nationalist troops in Lunxian and Jiyang that evening. The Nationalist troops retreated on the morning of the 29th.

[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, _ Day Telegram] The fighting on the outskirts of Xuzhou is quiet. Since the Communist troops captured Zaozhuang, they have suffered heavy casualties and have not only been unable to continue their offensive, but also unable to maintain the towns they have already plundered. Especially since Hao Pengju's troops revolted, the Communist troops in southern Shandong have not only lost a powerful assistant, but also increased their worries. Currently, the Communist New 7th Division, 1st Division, and 4th Division are all concentrated on the line of Chongfang, Matouzhen, and Tancheng to prevent a Nationalist counterattack. Their New 1st Division is in Lijiazhuang (30 kilometers north of Tancheng), and the 7th Division is in Chianzhen (10 kilometers west of Tancheng).

[Our Newspaper, Xuzhou, _ Day Telegram] The Communist army's second offensive to encircle the two wings of Xuzhou has already begun in the border areas of Lu, Su and Yu. The Communist troops of Liu Bocheng and Yang Yong, totaling about 100,000 men, captured Chengwu and Shanxian. Following which, they continued to probe into Yishan, Shangqiu, Fengxian, and Peixian, clearly attempting to cut off the Longhai Railway by means of split-up raids, and then detour to Xiayi, Yongcheng, and Suixian, to threaten the flanks of Xuzhou. However, the military here has long been aware of the Communist army's tricks and has made thorough arrangements. In addition, Yutai and Jinxiang remain as solid as a rock. Strategically, the Nationalist army is in a completely advantageous position. If the Communist army insists on going its own way, it will inevitably suffer a devastating blow. Chen Yi and Xu Xiangqian are currently gathering more than 200,000 Communist troops in the Tancheng area of ​​southern Shandong. Recently, Hao Pengju's uprising has caused the Communist army's plan to make trouble in southern Shandong to fall into a state of panic. At this moment, the strength of the Nationalist army is not only determined to crush any offensive by the Communist army, but also sufficient to completely stabilize the entire situation in southern Shandong in the short term.

[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 29th Telegram] Liu Bocheng's six columns are currently being encircled by the Nationalist army in the adjacent areas of eastern Henan, western Shandong, and northern Jiangsu. In eastern Henan, the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Columns are being encircled by the Nationalist army in the Guanyintang area of ​​Ningling County, south of the Longhai Railway, on the 29th. Zhang Taisheng and Wei Hanman's units, originally in the northwest Yongcheng area of ​​eastern Henan, were prevented from joining the two columns and were also cut off by the Nationalist army. The 3rd Column, which disturbed Yejigang in the western part of Minquan County, has been driven away by the Nationalist army. In northern Jiangsu and western Shandong, the 4th, 6th, and 7th Columns were intercepted by the Nationalist army on the 29th in the Maliangji and Zhungyu areas between Yishan, Fengxian, and Shanxian, and fierce fighting broke out.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, _ Day Telegram] According to Communist Party spokesman Mei Yi on _ evening, he heard from Yan'an Broadcasting that a government plane flew over Linyi three times in one day on the 29th.

Inspection of the Area Behind the Southern Bank of the Songhua River
[Our Newspaper, Changchun, 30th Telegram] A group of more than 20 journalists from Changchun went to inspect the area behind the Communist troops on the south bank of the Songhua River on the 29th. Dehui to the north was full of devastation. The villages and farms passed through were all destroyed, and the remaining houses were empty. The returning refugees had no clothes or food. According to Cui _lan, the magistrate of Dehui County, 30,000 refugees need to be resettled. Because livestock and food have been looted, the spring plowing next year will be the most serious problem, and this year's actual land tax collection has also been greatly affected. The reporter was led by the military to visit the bridgehead built by the Russians when repairing the Middle East Railway on the north bank of the Songhua River, which was tenaciously defended by the group. More than a thousand shells were fired by the Communist army, but it still stood unmoved, with only bullet marks. Division Commander Zeng Yukun talked about the battle in northern Jilin, saying: The Battle of Yilin Ridge (one hundred and ten li east of Dehui) stabilized the battle. The main force of the Communist army, which attacked Jiutai fiercely, was blocked by a regiment of the Nationalist army. There was a bloody battle there for six days, and the Communist army suffered more than 10,000 casualties. Only 500 Nationalist troops broke through. According to the villagers, the Communist army used 28 large carts to transport the corpses for seven days and nights. Due to the heavy sacrifice of this battle, the Communist army's morale was greatly frustrated, and the offensive plan was hindered. The Nationalist army's reinforcements arrived in time, and the battle situation turned from danger to safety. However, according to observation, the situation along the Songhua River is still not stable and may be brewing a new situation.

Chief of Staff Chen Tells New Fourth Army; If You Repent and Start Anew, You Will Definitely Be Given Preferential Treatment; Also Admonishes Coerced Militias Not To Act As Cannon Fodder
[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, _ Day Telegram] Chief of Staff Chen Cheng issued a letter to the officers and soldiers of the New Fourth Army, the original text of which is as follows: Officers and soldiers of the New Fourth Army, elder brothers, you must all know that recently General Hao Pengju, unwilling to follow the Communist Party to do things that harm the country and the people, has resolutely telegraphed his defection and has taken office in Haizhou as the commander of the Lunan Pacification Zone and commander-in-chief of the 41st Group Army, as appointed by the government. Furthermore, General Zhang Buwu, commander of your Huaiyang Military Region, has recently taken the initiative to surrender and pledge allegiance to the country, and is now taking office as the commander of the 7th Detachment of Jiangsu as appointed by the government, stabilizing the local area in the southeast of Suqian. You are all citizens of the Republic of China and should distinguish between obedience and disobedience, and love your country. As the ancients said, "He who understands the times is a hero, and he who is unaware of the opportunity is not wise," and we believe that many of you originally joined the war of resistance against Japan, but are now forced to follow along in making trouble, which is certainly not what you wish. If you can also abandon evil and return to righteousness and repent and start anew, the Central Government can not only forgive your past mistakes, but will also give you preferential treatment. Now the Nationalist army is very close to you, which is the best opportunity for you to break away from the civil strife. We hope that you can all make a decisive decision. In addition, leaflets were distributed to the Communist army's militia, stating: Oppressed militiamen, you are all good people. The Communist Party forces you to join the army and become militiamen, putting you in the front line to charge, shed blood, and sacrifice, while they hide behind, leisurely and comfortable, wearing good clothes, eating good food, organizing struggle sessions, sister groups, seizing your property, and raping your wives and daughters. This is so cruel and vicious. How can anyone with blood endure this oppression? Now the Communist army in northern Jiangsu has been completely wiped out, and the Communist army in southern Shandong is also surrounded by the Nationalist army on a large scale. Annihilation is imminent. Oppressed militiamen, instead of dying as cannon fodder, it is better to surrender with weapons. The Nationalist army will definitely give you preferential treatment and heavy rewards. Militiamen, the time has come, bravely surrender with weapons.

National People's Organizations Support Government Statement
Hoping that the Communists Will Change Their Minds
[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 30th Telegram] After the National Government issued a statement on the current situation, the National People's Organizations Liaison Council sent a telegram to the entire country expressing its support. The original telegram stated: "Having read the National Government's statement on the current situation, it is righteous and stern. The Chinese Communists, at the cost of alienating the people of the country, have repeatedly and firmly rejected peace talks. What do they intend to do? The intention of Sima Zhao is known to all. Destroying the fruits of victory, lowering international status, creating an economic crisis, and newly losing social vitality, the Ten Days of Yangzhou and the Three Massacres of Jiading have reappeared today. What crime have our people committed to suffer such torment? Nothing is more gratifying to the enemy than the pain of the loved ones. The government's desire for peace and its willingness to endure all kinds of things for the country have been seen by the people of the world. The National Constitution passed by the National Assembly is based on the principles negotiated by the Political Consultative Conference, and the whole country is sincerely crowded, so there is no time to implement it. How can the Chinese Communists be allowed to go back on their words and make false statements to destroy the constitution in order to demand peace talks? As for the so-called restoration of the military positions of January 13th last year, it is even more unreasonable. If there is no intention to carve up the territory, it can only be implemented in accordance with the reorganization and unification plan. Then, there is no reason or need to dispute the military positions at that time. In short, returning the army to the country and returning the government to the people are what the whole country unanimously demands. The people have worked hard and should have a short rest. How can the melons of Taiwan be picked again? Who is the savior of the country and who is the sinner of the nation? The facts are there, and the truth is unique. It is by no means that any false propaganda can cover the eyes and ears of the people of the world with one hand. This association respectfully supports the government's established policy, implements constitutionalism, and completes construction. It hopes that the Chinese Communists will rein in at the precipice and change their minds, taking the will of the people as their will and the interests of the country as their interests. Putting down the butcher knife, one can become a Buddha on the spot. If they are still obsessed with their mistakes, it is the Chinese Communists' determination to be enemies of the country and the nation. Our compatriots throughout the country will abandon them together. We respectfully hope that everyone will unanimously advocate for it."

U.S. Termination of Relations with the Military Mediation Department is Unanimously Praised by Congress
Considered a Wise Decision by Marshall
[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 29th Telegram] American Congressmen have praised the U.S. decision to end its mediation in the Chinese civil war. Some excerpts are as follows: Former Democratic Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee Bloom said: "Secretary of State Marshall has sufficient reasons and confidence to choose this course of action, and I wholeheartedly express my support." Democratic Senator Bevan said: "This is a wise decision by General Marshall. I think we should withdraw completely from China, become a separate country, and let the United Nations Security Council handle the overall situation so that China can truly establish an effective democratic government. If we don't do this, China will eventually become a second Spain, not only with a civil war, but also an undeclared war between the great powers, with each side trying to control China." Congressman Mont said: "I think this move is unfortunate, but also unavoidable." Republican Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee Garnay said: "General Marshall is most familiar with the situation, and there must be reasons for his handling of the overall situation." Congressman Monsfield said: "I think the Chinese people should handle their own domestic disputes. Our decision on the future of China should be based on its ability to unite." In addition, Chairman Vandenberg of the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee and others are temporarily silent, pending further study. [Agence France-Presse, Washington, 29th Telegram] Chairman Eden of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, a Republican Congressman, said: "Based on what I know about the situation in China, Marshall worked for many years in the Three-Man Committee. After leaving China and returning to the country, he is now withdrawing from the Executive Headquarters, which is a wise and economical measure, because this Executive Headquarters is no longer necessary. As for the future relationship between China and the United States, this move has no significant impact. I believe that China and the United States will be able to cooperate closely in the coming year, with increasing rather than decreasing cooperation, in order to cope with the challenges of this era. I believe that the Foreign Affairs Committee's opinion will be the same as mine, so I dare to assert that I and the Foreign Affairs Committee and the House of Representatives have absolute trust in Marshall."

U.S. Diplomats Predict Marshall Will Make Another Statement
[Reuters, Washington, 29th Telegram] An official of the Department of the Navy told this agency that a statement on the withdrawal of all U.S. Marines stationed in China will be issued soon. Diplomats here believe that today's statement by the State Department is merely the implementation of the policy stated in General Marshall's report on the failure of his mission to China several weeks ago. Judging from today's message, U.S. huge loans to China and other financial aid will not be extended indefinitely. Diplomats here also expect that Secretary of State Marshall's actions today are to prepare to issue another statement expressing concrete support for the progressive and moderate elements of the two factions in China. However, the content of the policy has not yet been determined. At the same time, there is a general fear that since no one is mediating between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party in China, the civil war will inevitably escalate further.

We have abandoned every principle and every purpose for which we call on the army, navy, and air force to fight."

Corporal Peng Sen said: "I love being stationed in China. The Chinese people, except for the coolies and rickshaw pullers of the lower classes, are quite kind." One private said: "The Chinese Communists say that we are interfering in their internal affairs, which is correct, because we are here, making it impossible for those guys to attack Tianjin." Sergeant Pilai said: "I am happy to be stationed in China. It seems that I am not _ these _ people."

U.S. Termination of Mediation Work in China Is Acknowledging China's Sovereignty and Independence
[Our Newspaper Report] San Francisco, 30th Broadcast: The New York Times published a commentary today, mentioning that the U.S. termination of mediation work in China, according to reports, is not because the U.S. is no longer interested in China and is implementing a "washing hands" policy.

This policy has not changed.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 30th Telegram] The initial draft of the Five-Year Plan for Political Construction has been drafted by the Central Design Bureau. After comprehensive drafting, it will be sent to the Supreme National Defense Committee. This plan is a companion piece to the Five-Year Plan for Economic Construction.

After the End of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, the Special Technical Committee Is Considering the Issue of Relief Needs in China
[Central News Agency, New York, 29th Telegram] The following is a report issued today by the Special Technical Committee on Relief Needs after the end of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, which is related to China. This committee has given special consideration to the problem of China's relief needs for the year 1947. China's situation is very different from that of the European countries that have been considered. First: The United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration's assistance plan may continue until about June 30, 1947. However, this committee understands that the food supplies designated under the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration's plan will be shipped around March 31, 1947. The materials that have not yet been delivered under the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration's plan are expected to be shipped from April 1 to June 30, 1947, most of which are agricultural and industrial rehabilitation materials; Second: Due to the vast differences in economic conditions, the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration authorities did not calculate China's relief needs based on the basis of European countries. Therefore, this committee is studying China's relief needs by comparing them with the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration's plan. The Chinese government has submitted to this committee a plan for major relief needs for the one-year period from April 1, 1945 to March 31, 1946, explaining the total amount of each item under the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration's relief plan after March 31, 1947. The total amount after the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration's scope is reduced will be US$295 million. If the Chinese government can pay for the above-mentioned necessary imports by itself, the above-mentioned issue should be considered. The figures submitted by the Chinese government imply that the income from exports, remittances from overseas Chinese, and other items in 1947 will reach US$400 million. However, this committee does not have sufficient information to determine whether the total amount of the above-mentioned income can meet the minimum relief import needs suggested by the Chinese government for the one-year period starting from April 1, 1947. Furthermore, this committee is also unaware of the extent of China's other assets that can be used to pay for the import of the above-mentioned relief supplies. Therefore, this committee cannot determine whether China can pay for all of its minimum relief needs, but this should not prevent countries around the world from continuing to study the above-mentioned issue in order to determine whether it is necessary to deal with any relief needs.

Philippine "Legislative Extortion"
Anti-Chinese Immigration Bill Passes First Reading and Will Soon Undergo Second Reading
[Central News Agency, Manila, 29th Telegram] It is reported that the Philippine government's bill opposing the continued immigration of Chinese into the Philippines will soon undergo a second reading.

The participants in the meeting are the speaker of the provincial assembly and the resident committee members, the commissioners of each district, and the magistrates and county councilors of each county. When the reporter then asked about the situation in Guoyang, which was recovered two ten-days ago, Li said: The occupation of Guoyang for a time was caused by the communist troops wandering from the border of Henan. After three regiments of the national army attacked, it was quickly recovered. The Communist army has now returned to its original location in Henan Province. However, although the Communist army's intrusion into Guoyang was extremely brief, the local area has suffered deeply, the people have been displaced and need to be rescued urgently.

The Truth of the Fire Case Gradually Becomes Clear; Six Firefighters to Be Transferred Today; Prosecutor Hopes Victims Will Provide Concrete Evidence; Investigation Committee Set Out Again Yesterday to Conduct Interviews

[Report from Our Newspaper] The five-person investigation committee for the Seymour Road fire case, after two days of on-site visits, has gradually clarified the truth of the case. Yu Shuping, Deputy Director of the Municipal Police Bureau, based on the investigation results of the investigation committee, has ordered the Criminal Division of the Bureau to detain six people, including Li Xun, Squad Leader of the Fire Department, Shift Leader Shang Zhi (No. 340), and firefighters No. 011, No. 017, No. 108, and No. 587. Yesterday, the First Section of the Criminal Division interrogated them throughout the day and will summon the interrogated parties for questioning. It is understood that Li Xun and the other six are scheduled to be transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office today by the Police Bureau. The District Prosecutor's Office of this city also attaches great importance to the case and has been actively conducting investigations and collecting relevant evidence in recent days. It has also been decided to summon Shen Qiulin and his wife, the alleged arsonists, on February 1. For other related parties, summons will be temporarily delayed until sufficient evidence is obtained. Yesterday, Shen, the prosecutor in charge of the case, said: "The investigation of this case is quite difficult. The victims have not been able to describe the actual situation during the spread of the fire or provide various evidence. While all parties are conducting investigations, we sincerely hope that the victims can provide concrete evidence to facilitate the investigation."

Unclear Calculation of Wang Family's Losses

Yesterday, in order to obtain the truth as soon as possible, the investigation committee gathered again at 9:00 AM to inspect the cargo yard. In addition to Ge Kexin from the investigation committee, Zhang Da, Director of the Inspection Department of the Police Bureau, Zhang Nai Zuo, representative of the Municipal Council, Hou Wanren, District Chief, and Pan Wenzhen, Principal of the National Elementary School, who was a victim, Zhang Li San and Zhang Quan from the Supervisory Office also went to the vicinity of the fire scene to investigate.

The main target of yesterday's investigation was Wang Yunfu at No. 29, because since the fire, there have been widespread rumors that the Wang family suffered the greatest losses. However, Wang himself has not come forward to testify, possibly fearing retaliation from the firefighters. When the committee visited yesterday morning, they still did not see Wang Yunfu. However, according to Wang's relative, Cheng Zexun, the Wang family's daughters-in-law all had private savings, so the total number of gold bars and jewelry could not be counted. It was also difficult to estimate what Wang himself owned. However, the loss of gold items alone was at least 150 taels or more, from which the magnitude of the total loss can be inferred. In addition, there were two typewriters, seven radios, and sixty boxes, all of which were reduced to ashes. Also, in Mrs. Wang's room, there were three wardrobes that were axed open. These wardrobes are now stored in the District Court for record.

National Elementary School Education Provides Supplementary Materials

Teachers from the Seymour Road National Elementary School provided supplementary materials yesterday. They said that after the first fire was extinguished, they stopped moving the school equipment and ran outside to watch the rescue efforts. At that time, there was one firefighter and one bystander at the entrance of No. 29. The ladder was already set up high, and the lights inside the house were bright. After a few minutes, fire started to appear from the corner of the east room, but no water was seen used for rescue. Regarding the cause of the spread of the fire, Ms. Pan, the principal of the school, suspected that it was caused by fire spreading through the concealed wiring. On the third floor of the house, there was a small room, which was very narrow and its use was unknown. It was usually used to store newspapers or waste materials. However, it was unknown that the small room was in a space with wiring and that between the two houses there was a hole through which the wires in each house were connected, which was a hidden danger. According to Principal Pan, when No. 29 was burning during the disaster, thick smoke billowed straight out of the hole, suffocating people.

Peppermint Liquor; Young Mistress of the Wang Family; Lost Two Diamond Rings; Firefighters Did Not Save the Fire; Poured Water on the Nanny

During lunchtime, the reporter visited the victims of No. 29, Wang Yunfu's family, with the investigator, and obtained quite novel and valuable information, which is recorded below:

Cheng Suying (Young Mistress of the Wang Family) stated: "Because I had been robbed by bandits before, after this incident, I scattered my belongings in various places and it was not easy to find them immediately. So, in the ashes, I found my eldest son's gold watch, which was already broken, and two diamond rings that had lost their diamonds. All the clothes were burned. As for the foreign wine bottles left behind by the firefighters, which people suspected, their location was also revealed by Cheng Suying. She said, 'In the wine cabinet outside the bedroom on the second floor, there used to be Peppermint liquor.' From this, it can be known that the owner of the wine drunk by the firefighters at the public stove was Cheng Suying."

Wang Ai Ma (Nanny) stated: "When the fire started, all the windows upstairs and downstairs were open, and the electric lights were bright. There were also electric sparks in the wooden framework. I begged the firefighters to put out the fire, but not only did they not agree, but they also used the fire hose to spray me, drenching me with water."

Xiao Sheng (Chauffeur) stated: "I sent the young mistress to 'Mei Qi' and when I came back, I saw the fire. I reported to the family, called the fire department, and started to put out the fire. Seeing that the fire was very big and there was no hope, I drove to the hospital to pick up the master. When I came back, the fire truck had already arrived. I saw a fire in the east connecting room, but it was soon extinguished, leaving only a little smoke. I asked the firefighter if it was serious? He said it was probably not serious, probably the fire from the wooden cabinet was transmitted from the big tree next to it."

A Fu (Rickshaw Puller) stated: "I saw two hoses going in from the front and back doors. The hoses were thick, as if they had water, but I didn't see the nozzle, and I didn't see any water being sprayed. The firefighters were running around inside the house busily. The second time the fire started, they didn't allow me to go upstairs. The hoses were not connected, and water didn't drip from upstairs."

In addition, the Wang family's maids, A Ma, A Jin, and A Xiu, also made statements, the content of which was generally the same.

It's a Fact that They Didn't Save the Fire! It's a Fact that They Looted Things! The Exact Number of Gold Jewelry Losses Cannot Be Estimated; Victim Wang Yunfu Expressed Anger

At 3:00 PM, the reporter went to the Jiangning Road Branch Bureau to interview Wang Yunfu with the investigator. Wang Yunfu was wearing a long robe, had a Shanghai accent, was about fifty or sixty years old, and was short in stature. When he saw the reporters entering, his face showed slight tension, and he spoke impulsively and with a trembling voice. He said: "When the fire started on the first night of the Lunar New Year, my wife and I had already gone to bed. We were awakened in a panic and saw that the fire was still far away. I thought that my house would not be burned. At that time, I saw firefighters coming in and out. One firefighter asked me: 'Where is Taiping Road?' I replied that I didn't know. They didn't know that I was the owner, so..."

"...the matter of... is guaranteed not to have happened, but my son saw that when the fire was raging, he begged the firefighters, saying, 'Hurry up and put out the fire, I have everything in mind.' But I never saw the firefighters making an effort to put out the fire. The fire started on the third floor first, and their hoses were never dragged upstairs." At this time, Zhang Nai Zuo asked, "The firefighters walked into the house, saw that the decoration in the room was luxurious, and felt that the conditions you were talking about with the young master were too different, and they were dissatisfied, so they delayed the fire. In Mr. Wang's opinion, is this possible?"

Wang replied, "I dare not say for sure, but I dare not say it's impossible either. Because it's a fact that the firefighters didn't save the fire, and it's also a fact that they looted things. Why didn't the hoses spray upstairs? Why weren't the existing ladders used?" He was indignant.

Wang also acknowledged the property listed by Cheng Zexun, such as more than 150 taels of gold items and seven radios, and added that there were also three cameras and many "small yellow fish" (small gold bars), the exact number of which could not be estimated. There were also many valuable calligraphy and paintings. As for the number of jewelry losses of Mrs. Wang, he said that he had not asked about it, so he did not know the details. He only knew that Mrs. Wang had six leather coats and he had more than ten leather robes, all of which were burned to ashes.

Looting by Taking Advantage of the Situation; May Be Sentenced to Death by Firing Squad; Zhang Da Talks About the Investigation Committee Having Decision-Making Power

Zhang Da, Director of the Inspection Department of the Police Bureau, made the following statement based on the information obtained: "(1) When the flames spread from the carpenter's house to the wooden cabinet at No. 29, the commander of the fire brigade should have ordered the team members to quickly pull the wooden cabinet away, so that the fire would not have affected No. 29. This was an easy measure to take, but the commander did not do this, so his dereliction of duty is obvious. Therefore, the commander should be immediately dismissed and investigated. The Fire Department should also improve its methods. In the future, when there is a fire, not only should the commander be dispatched, but the commander-in-chief should also personally go to the scene to supervise the rescue efforts. (2) Since the Wang family's losses are so heavy, even after the fire, the remaining ashes should still be in the rubble. If they are dug out, materials with knife marks and ax marks can be obtained. Wang's family should be ordered to send workers to excavate. Director Zhang also ordered the Jiangning Road Branch Bureau to send police to guard the fire site, and the Baojia and the Fire Department should send personnel to jointly monitor it. (3) When the fire started, because the roof was too thick, it could not be opened, hindering the rescue efforts. The most ideal method is to use potassium hydroxide to promote its dissolution. As for the lesson of fire spreading through the concealed wiring, attention should be paid to it in future construction. (4) When asked what punishment should be given for the crime, he replied: "If prosecuted for ordinary robbery, the maximum sentence is life imprisonment. If reported for robbery by taking advantage of the situation, they may be sentenced to death by firing squad." The Investigation Committee will decide which crime to prosecute. Director Zhang finally said that in the old Public Concession days, firefighters should be inspected after returning from rescue, but this was abolished by the enemy and puppets, and has remained so until now."

Mid-Air Crash of China National Aviation Corporation Passenger Plane in Western Hubei; Only Survivor is a Child; The Company is Investigating the Cause of the Accident

[Report from Our Newspaper] After China National Aviation Corporation C-46 Type No. 145 Shanghai-Chongqing flight crashed in Tianmen County, Western Hubei on the 28th, the company immediately dispatched medical and technical personnel to rescue and investigate. Shen De, General Manager of China National Aviation Corporation, personally accompanied Chief Pilot McDonald and Secretary Wu Jingyan on a flight to inspect the accident site the day before yesterday, and returned to Nanjing yesterday to report the inspection results to the Ministry of Transport before returning to Shanghai. Yesterday, when a reporter visited the responsible authorities of the company, it was stated that when they inspected the site the day before yesterday, they did see that the No. 145 aircraft was damaged on the ground, and there were many onlookers nearby. One wing of the aircraft flew half a mile away. Yesterday, a plane from the派出所, accompanied by two small planes and four engineers, arrived at the accident site at 3:44 PM yesterday. However, because there was no telecommunications equipment at the site, all reports had to be made after arriving in Hankou. According to a telegram report from the Tianmen County Government yesterday, of the 27 passengers who were killed, only one child has been found alive so far (it is noted that when the three planes in this city crashed before, only Wang’s younger brother was unharmed) and is now being treated in the hospital. Another foreign missionary who was rescued and sent to the hospital died in the hospital due to serious injuries. At the same time, Gao Dajing, Director of the Business Department of the company, also flew to Hankou yesterday to handle the aftermath. According to the authorities, the aftermath of the victims will be handled in accordance with the past procedures, and the families of the victims will be transported to Hankou to handle the funeral arrangements.

According to Gao, the person in charge, told reporters that the cause of the accident was quite strange. The No. 145 aircraft was one of the best C-46 models in the company, the pilot was also one of the best, and the weather was absolutely good. There were no mountains in the area, so the cause of the accident was really unclear. The specialized technician sent to the site on a small plane is to investigate the cause of the accident.

After China National Aviation Corporation Flight No. 138 from Hong Kong to Chongqing departed from Hong Kong on the 25th of this month, there has been no news. Although planes have been dispatched to search in various places for days, there has still been no news.

Discuss Improving Measures Before Resuming Flights

[Report from Our Newspaper in Nanjing on the 30th] Passenger transport by China National Aviation Corporation and Central Air Transport Corporation has been ordered to suspend by the Ministry of Transport due to repeated aircraft accidents. It is learned that the persons in charge of the two companies met at the Ministry of Transport at 5:00 PM on the 29th to discuss measures to prevent accidents. Minister Yu said that repeated civil aviation accidents have lost the public's trust. It is better to temporarily suspend passenger transport until improvement measures have been discussed before resuming. This is why the Ministry of Transport ordered the suspension of flights. As for when flights can be resumed in the future, the Ministry of Transport will hold another meeting in the next few days to discuss it in detail before a decision can be made.

Ministry of Transport Announces Reasons for Suspension

[Report from Central News Agency in Nanjing on the 30th] Authorities from the Ministry of Transport announced to reporters today that the weather was very good on the day of the Shanghai-Chongqing flight accident. Whether there were other special reasons is worthy of attention. A person in charge has been dispatched to thoroughly investigate. Before the truth is clear, the Ministry of Transport has ordered the two companies to temporarily suspend domestic and international passenger transport. The transport authorities are aware that the disruption of domestic transport and the impact on travel after the suspension of flights are significant. The two companies themselves will also suffer significant losses. However, it is necessary for the safety of passengers. Fortunately, there are not many air passengers. However, the postal service is important for communication, so the companies are still ordered to continue to operate it. In recent months, there have been repeated reports of aircraft accidents abroad. The main reason is often weather. China's aviation industry is still in its infancy. In order to ensure safety and protect the civil aviation industry, it is necessary to be extra cautious. Once the cause is found and improvements are made, flights will be resumed on a scheduled basis.

Passengers Rescued from South China Sea Plane Crash; Zhu Qiao Xian and Zhou Li Juan Waiting for Ships in Hong Kong to Return to Shanghai; Negotiations with the Company Are Underway; Compensation of US$10,000 Per Person

[Report from Our Newspaper] Guan Shengfu, a passenger who was rescued from the Far Eastern Airlines "Miss Luzon" plane crash in the sea, safely returned to this city a few days ago. According to reports, of the 30 passengers on the plane, 23 were rescued, and 17 have left the funeral and gone to Australia, Hong Kong, and Shanghai.

Of the six people currently in Manila, Zou, Ma Kaihua, Nian Jiaming, and Li Bin are still recuperating in the hospital. Zou needs to recuperate for a month due to internal injuries. The other three have minor injuries. Zou's friend, Dai Zhicheng, is also staying there. Both of them are managers of the Dihua Economic Development Company in this city. Englishman Shi Dong is also staying there to handle the aftermath negotiations on behalf of the foreign passengers.

Of the 17 passengers who left Manila, English schoolchildren the White Rock brothers have gone to Australia to study. Another schoolchild, Spikens, has already come to Shanghai. The remaining 13 people are currently in Hong Kong. Except for You Guo Ke, who has gone to Guangzhou, several people plan to stay in Hong Kong, and the rest are waiting for ships to return to Shanghai.

Guan Shengfu works at the "American Paisley Boiler Factory" in this city. Because the factory also has branches in Manila, he was able to purchase a ship ticket and come to Shanghai via Hong Kong first. According to reports, Ms. Zhu Qiao Xian, a student who went to the United States to study, and Ms. Zhou Li Juan, a Metropolitan Red Dance Girl, are currently waiting for a ship to return to Shanghai.

Guan also said that he represented Chinese passengers in Manila to negotiate with Far Eastern Airlines, demanding compensation for luggage, mental, and time losses, US$10,000 per passenger. Lawyer Xue is continuing to negotiate.

As for the seven passengers who died, each person may receive US$15,000 to US$25,000 in compensation.

Lucky and Unlucky, Life and Death Are Destined; A Twisting and Touching Story

[Report from Our Newspaper] China National Aviation Corporation Flight No. 145 Shanghai-Chongqing passenger plane crashed in Tianmen County, Western Hubei, on the 28th, and there is a twisting and touching story among the victims.

The passenger list includes a businessman named Chen Enhua (see picture), who is prominently "listed on the list," but in fact, this person is now safe and sound in Shanghai, gloating over his extremely good fortune. This person is a merchant and has no magic power to return to Shanghai safely when the plane crashed, so the "Chen Enhua" on the plane is another person. It is learned that the unfortunate "scapegoat" was named Zhang Xinfu, who was a food supplier on the Yangtze River water tanker Yongkang, and was a close friend of Chen. Chen came to Shanghai a month ago to purchase goods and stayed at the Xinshu Trading Company on Guangdong Road. He originally planned to take Flight No. 145 back to Chongqing, and the plane ticket had also been purchased, but a sum of money suddenly arrived and the goods could not be purchased, so he planned to go another day. At that time, Zhang Xinfu happened to be contracting for Yongkang and needed to go to Chongqing to purchase rice because the price of rice on the ship was too expensive, so he obtained the plane ticket from Chen and took the place on the plane. Unexpectedly, he "met the occasion," while Chen was spared from the disaster. It can truly be said that there is luck and misfortune.

There is also the story of Mrs. He Yulin, whose experience on this plane is even more sad. Mrs. He is a student at a university in Wuchang, 33 years old this year. Her husband, He Yulin, is the General Manager of the Chongqing Min生 Bank. The name on the plane ticket was actually He Yulin himself. He had originally planned to fly to Chongqing to prepare for the establishment of the Min觀 Bank in Chongqing, which was approved by the Ministry of Finance not long ago in this city with辯實业 company, and had booked a ticket for December 20 last year, but was delayed because three passenger planes crashed in Shanghai and flights were temporarily suspended. He had heard about the plane crash and advised his wife to take a boat to Chongqing, but Mrs. He insisted on traveling with him. On the 25th of this month, the couple booked two passenger tickets and paid the fare on the spot, but when they went to pick up the tickets on the 27th, the company only gave them one ticket. At that time, the staff did not explain the reason. After unsuccessful negotiations, the He couple had to go to Chongqing one after another. The name on the passenger ticket was He himself, but Mrs. He insisted on going first, saying that she could go to handle the accommodation first. As a result, she was killed in the accident. It can also be said that "life and death are destined"!

The He couple originally booked two passenger tickets, but one ticket was snatched away temporarily. The person who got on the plane with this temporary ticket was the "lucky one" at the time, but the result proved to be the "unfortunate one," namely Min Taosheng, the General Manager of Huawi Bank. Min is 40 years old this year and from Sichuan. His task in Chongqing was to inspect the affairs of the Huawi Bank's Chongqing branch and manage the family property. He had originally booked a ticket for the 30th, but because he was anxious to leave earlier, he asked Manager Zhu of the Xinsui Company to find a way to get He Yulin's passenger ticket. Zhu and He were also acquaintances. When He sent his wife to the airport that day, Zhu expressed his apologies for this matter, but as a result, He was spared from the disaster. It is truly "a blessing in disguise."

The remaining passengers, in addition to foreign missionaries, were mostly from the business community: Wang Keqin was a Sichuan native produce merchant who came to Shanghai a month ago to negotiate business with a vegetable oil factory in this city and was returning to Chongqing because of this. Liu Linbin was a former rudder worker on the Sanbei Company's round-trip steamer. After being dismissed, he planned to return to his hometown. The plane ticket was entrusted to a friend from the 工礦 Bank to purchase on his behalf. Ni Bing was a student at West China University, a native of Pudong in this city, only 27 years old and not yet married. Li Fengbai had just come to Shanghai from Hankou. This passenger ticket was also purchased by someone on his behalf for the purpose of doing business in Chongqing. Shu Zunmin was an engineer at the Zhongyuan Paper Mill who came to Shanghai from the Yibao General Factory in Sichuan at the end of last year for official business. There is also the background of Lei Shunmin and Gao Jiexin is unknown.

He Yulin and Heavenly People Who Died in the Disaster

Digging for Three Days and Nights After the Fire; Only a Few Small Gold Bars Were Found

Regarding the committee's decision to have the Wang family excavate the fire site again, Mr. Wang has expressed his opposition because Mr. Wang has sent workers to excavate the fire site for three days and three nights after the fire was extinguished. However, only a few small "yellow fish", gold lockets, etc. were found, and two boxes of silver utensils were obtained. The gold bars and jewelry have all disappeared.

400 Dan of Pig Bristles; Insurance of 700 Million Yuan

It is also learned that the 400 boxes of pig bristles piled up in the warehouse belong to the eldest son (Wang Ji). Wang Ji is an exporter. When purchasing pig bristles, he took out a loan from the bank, so the bank took out insurance on his behalf. The insurance amount is 695 million yuan, insured by China, Anping, and Thai Insurance Companies. As for the household furniture in the house, it was not insured. Mr. Wang once said, "I really don't know how much furniture there is in my house"!

It is also learned from the reporters yesterday: Regarding the insurance issue of pig bristles, there may still be twists and turns, because China, Anping, and other insurance companies went to the fire scene yesterday to investigate. It is rumored that the result of the research is that the insurance amount is far different from the actual goods, so how to compensate may still be a dispute.

Report to the Fire Department by Phone; The Answer Was "Don't Joke"

The committee believes that Wang's family is the most important object to clarify the truth of this fire and must be questioned in detail, even though Wang is temporarily living at No. 104 Jiangning Road (where some members of Wang's family are temporarily residing). This house is a Shikumen house with one floor up and one floor down, which looks very cramped.

Wang Wenying, Wang's daughter, is in her twenties and is very good at conversation. Yesterday, she provided many concrete facts, saying that the investigation was very helpful. The details are as follows:

Wang Wenying said: "When the fire started, it was not yet. I immediately went to wake up my parents and fled out of the house. Her brother (Wang) immediately called the fire department to report the fire, twice, once 00, and the other time 15XXX (she said: I can't remember the last three numbers now. The reporter guessed that it must be 15183, the Central Fire Department). The answer received was: "Don't make"! (meaning don't joke). Then, I hung up the phone. Wang had no choice but to run out for help and happened to meet a fire truck driving to Xinzha Road. He immediately stopped it and automatically dragged a hose to try to put out the fire, but there was no water. A firefighter replied: "The pump on this car is broken." When the fire started, Wang Wenying accompanied her parents to hide in the garage. A fat firefighter came in and asked: "Your house is very particular. Where is the safe?" Wang Wenying replied that she did not know. The firefighter comforted her and said: "It doesn't matter, the fire is burning towards the Yongqin Rubber Factory." At that time, Wang Wenying clearly saw the firefighters using the hose to put out the fire in the rubber factory. Because the street lights were very bright, she could see it very clearly. Before long, white smoke was coming out of the fire, and her parents said: "I have heard people say since I was little that after a big fire, white smoke comes out, and there will be nothing wrong." But after half an hour, the third floor caught fire."

People Coming in and out of the Wang Family in an Endless Stream

At that time, firefighters came in and out of the Wang family constantly. After about an hour of burning, the wires were broken, but the flashlight lights of the firefighters on the second floor were sometimes visible and sometimes not, but they never stopped. Until about 1:00 AM, she felt hopeless and left with her mother. At 6:00 AM the next morning, when Wang Wenying visited again, the third floor had collapsed.

Miss Wang's Losses Alone Were Heavy

Miss Wang had a jewelry box placed in the bedroom on the third floor, which she was unable to retrieve. The jewelry box was divided into three compartments, top, middle, and bottom. The top and bottom compartments contained gold lockets, small yellow fish, diamond rings, etc., and the bottom compartment contained three large bars of gold. When excavating the next day, the small yellow fish and gold lockets were still there, but the big bars of gold were missing. When Miss Wang was excavating the remains, she heard the firefighters on the scene say: "The ones who came first made a fortune, and the ones who came later were unlucky!"

After Miss Wang reported in detail, she said: "I am very grateful for the enthusiasm of all the investigators. However, Chinese people often only have five minutes of enthusiasm. This time is related to everyone's safety. I hope it can be thoroughly investigated!"

Opium and Opium Pipes Were Found in the Home of a Bank Manager

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Sichuan Road Police Department received a secret report the day before yesterday, saying that Fu Bingzhang, the manager of the Guofu Bank, had recently smuggled a large amount of opium from Tianjin and hid it in his home at No. 34 Taian Lane, Shanxi Road. Deputy Director Wang Jianxin led a team to rush there. As a result, 26 taels of opium, two opium pipes, four liang and four qian of opium ash, and other opium paraphernalia were seized. His wife, Mrs. Fu, was taken to the police station. According to her confession, she used to smoke opium but has now quit. All the opium and other items were left over. The分局 transferred Fu to the police hospital for investigation, and a wanted order will be issued for her husband, Fu Bingzhang, and he will be investigated upon arrest.

Because the Huanghai steamship (represented by Sanbei in Tianjin), managed by the Minsheng Company, ran aground in the silt upstream of Tanggu, its navigation was obstructed. The Huang and Haihang steamships are now assisting in dragging it. As soon as the Huanghai is out of danger, the two steamships can come to Shanghai. As for the Qimei steamship, which sailed from Tianjin the day before yesterday, it is currently waiting in Zhifu Island due to poor weather in the north. Under the current circumstances, it can sail to Tianjin, and the Cai steamship can sail directly to Tanggu today.

Shanghai-Chuansha Train Robbery Case; Four More Criminals Apprehended; Firearms Retrieved from Floating Coffin

[Report from Our Newspaper] On December 18 of last year, when a small train on the Chuansha Road was passing through Xinlu Station, it was suddenly boarded by a large number of bandits armed with new-style weapons, who forced the driver to stop the train and then carried out a robbery. Although military and police agencies sent personnel to investigate in all directions after the incident, and a number of suspects were arrested in Pudong, Chuansha, and other places, the case is quite complicated and has not yet been resolved. It is learned that the detective class of the Police Bureau, based on a tip-off, recently apprehended four bandits involved in the case, Wang Wan, Wang Longsheng, Pan Asi, and Wang He, in a small boat near Zhangjiabin in Longhua. They also retrieved a pistol, a rifle, and a Mauser pistol from a coffin floating in the wheat field of Zhangjiabin and took them back for investigation. According to their confession, in addition to the train robbery, they also robbed Ying Dang, an individual in the East Street of Nanqiao, Fengxian in the same month, stealing cash, gold jewelry, and firearms from the individual.

Opening of Weida Shipping Company

Qiu Yuheng and others in the shipping industry jointly founded the Weida Shipping Company. The "Dazheng" and "Weida" ships sail between Shanghai and Huzhou, carrying passengers and goods. The two ships are converted from U.S. Navy landing craft and sail steadily and quickly. The official opening will be held today at No. 458 North Suzhou Road, and a sailing ceremony will be held.

The Educational Committee of the Municipal Council Nominates Candidates; Resolve the Tuition Fee Issue of Private Schools; Research Fee Standards Based on the Cost of Living Index; Teachers and Staff Members Issued Declarations Yesterday Clarifying Their Attitudes

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Educational Committee of the Municipal Council held its eighth meeting yesterday afternoon and resolved: (1) To review the budget of the Education Bureau, after nominating Zhou Feicheng and eight others to visit the Education Bureau. (2) To nominate Zhang Yiqu and four others to gather and compile statistics based on the actual situation of tuition fees charged by private schools before the war and materials provided by people from all walks of life, with concrete evidence attached, and to conduct thorough research taking into account the cost of living index, in order to formulate reasonable fee standards for reporting to the Congress for reference.

[Another Report] The Municipal Elementary School Teachers United Continuing Education Association, because the fee standards stipulated by the Municipal Council caused an uproar, specifically issued a declaration yesterday, which stated: "Currently, due to the high rise in prices, the lives of every teacher are under extreme threat. We believe that in order to maintain education, this serious problem must be resolved reasonably immediately. Recently, the majority of principals have advocated increasing tuition fees to improve the treatment of teachers. Of course, this is also a method, but we believe that this method is worthy of serious consideration, because in today's sluggish industrial and commercial economy, the general parents are already burdened by life and cannot afford it. People from all walks of life have raised great doubts about the issue of economic openness and rational allocation. In order to dispel doubts and to show a sincere commitment to

Hygiene and Medicine Epidemic Meningitis Qian Ying Any bacteria entering the bloodstream, if localized in the meninges, can induce local inflammation, leading to meningeal irritation and systemic toxicity symptoms such as fever and coma. This is collectively termed meningitis. Examples include those caused by pneumococcus, staphylococcus, tubercle bacillus, and syphilis spirochete. Additionally, during acute infectious diseases like typhoid fever and typhus, especially in children, toxins invading the central nervous system can also cause meningeal irritation, presenting meningitis-like symptoms. However, in these cases, the meninges themselves are not truly inflamed. We call this spurious meningitis, the distinction of which will be discussed later. The meningitis commonly referred to, and the subject of this article, is caused by the meningococcus. Because it is invariably epidemic, it is also known as epidemic meningitis. Several Factors of Infection The pathogen of this disease is a Gram-negative diplococcus. The routes and sources of transmission are mostly direct, from small droplets expelled from the nose and throat of patients or carriers. Occasionally, indirect transmission occurs via utensils, but this is rare. After the pathogen enters through the respiratory tract, it initially attaches to the pharynx, from where it directly invades the meninges via the lymphatic vessels, or enters the bloodstream and eventually localizes in the meninges. Therefore, the bacteria can be detected sequentially in the pharynx, blood, and cerebrospinal fluid. The factors influencing its transmission and epidemic spread are as follows: (1) In winter and spring, due to variable weather, upper respiratory tract infections are easily triggered, thus reducing local and systemic resistance, making infection more likely. Excessive fatigue is also an important predisposing factor. (2) Public places and crowded areas with poor ventilation, such as dormitories and factories, facilitate contact with patients or carriers, increasing the risk of infection. (3) Although both patients and carriers can spread infectious droplets, carriers pose the main threat, infecting healthy individuals. However, not everyone infected becomes ill; many become healthy carriers, spreading the bacteria further. During a large epidemic, the carrier rate within a community or group can be as high as 50% or more. The higher this rate, the greater the chance of contracting the disease. (4) Children under ten are most susceptible to infection, while adult cases are less common. However, patients over forty are at similar risk as young children. Clinical Symptoms Whether it is a large epidemic, a small outbreak, or sporadic cases, the incubation period from the time the bacteria invade to the onset of symptoms is about one week. Initially, when the bacteria are still confined to the pharynx, there are usually no significant systemic symptoms, except for occasional local discomfort. If resistance is weak, the bacteria enter the bloodstream, and the patient develops systemic toxicity, commonly with chills, fever, and headache. Due to the effects of the bacteria and their toxins, purpura may appear on the body. Further invasion of the meninges by the bacteria and their toxins leads to meningitis symptoms. Inflammation increases intracranial pressure, intensifying headache and vomiting, eventually leading to coma and convulsions, as well as signs of meningeal irritation, most notably neck stiffness and Kernig's sign. If treated appropriately, about 90% of such cases can recover. Otherwise, more than half may die within about a week. This is the so-called typical meningitis, generally recognized by the public. Due to variations in the virulence of the bacteria, the patient's resistance, and other unknown factors, some patients have particularly mild symptoms and recover spontaneously without treatment. Others have extremely severe symptoms, with high fever, vomiting, and widespread purpura from the outset. Due to severe sepsis, they die in a short time before the meningitis stage. Some patients, due to late or incomplete treatment, experience relapses and become chronic, with pus blocking the passages between the ventricles, leading to hydrocephalus, brain abscesses, or permanent nerve damage, such as deafness or blindness. In other cases, the bacteria simultaneously invade the brain and spinal cord, resulting in more complex symptoms. Furthermore, there is a type of septicemic infection that only presents with prolonged fever, rash, arthritis, and damage to other organs, persisting for months without any meningitis symptoms. These cases require a physician and complete diagnostic equipment for accurate diagnosis. How to Confirm the Diagnosis? During an epidemic, if patients with the aforementioned symptoms are seen, families may have a sense of foreboding and send them to the hospital for treatment early, just as patients with vomiting and diarrhea are sent to epidemic hospitals during a cholera outbreak. This reduces the possibility of overlooked and missed diagnoses, and the condition will not be unduly delayed, benefiting both the patient and society. However, in sporadic cases, misdiagnosis is inevitable, relying on the vigilance of families and physicians, especially during winter and spring. Doctors know that the diagnosis of meningitis relies on lumbar puncture and cerebrospinal fluid examination. If a patient has high fever, headache, vomiting, and signs of meningeal irritation, and lumbar puncture reveals turbid cerebrospinal fluid with increased polymorphonuclear cells, the diagnosis can be established. However, not all cases of turbid cerebrospinal fluid are epidemic meningitis, and the cerebrospinal fluid in the first one or two days of epidemic meningitis may not be turbid. Therefore, the onset of the illness and the presence of other systemic diseases must be observed and comprehensively considered. For example, if there are concurrent pneumonia or other signs of sepsis, the acute meningitis may be pneumococcal or part of other sepsis. The treatments and prognoses differ greatly. Therefore, definitive diagnosis relies on smear and culture of the cerebrospinal fluid to identify the pathogen, and blood culture is also very helpful for diagnosis. If cerebrospinal fluid chemistry is also performed, the diagnosis can be distinguished from epidemic encephalitis and poliomyelitis by the reduced sugar content in this disease. The cerebrospinal fluid cells in tuberculous meningitis and lymphocytic choriomeningitis are all lymphocytic, making differentiation easier. Spurious meningitis is invariably seen in severe acute infectious diseases. The degree of meningeal irritation is disproportionate to the increase in cerebrospinal fluid cell count, usually not exceeding several dozen, making it easy to identify. It is possible for this disease to occur simultaneously with other acute infectious diseases, but the cerebrospinal fluid will invariably be purulent in such cases. Occasionally, cerebrovascular diseases may present with similar symptoms, but they can be distinguished based on other conditions and cerebrospinal fluid examination. In summary, the diagnosis of this disease should not be difficult. However, the symptoms may not be standardized, and sometimes it is not as easy as desired, especially in the early stages and in atypical forms. If the common conditions are always kept in mind, the clinical variations are well understood, and other possibilities are considered, errors can be reduced. This applies to other diseases as well, and the same is true for this disease. Treatment Ten years ago, anti-meningococcal serum was used to treat this disease. If lumbar puncture yielded turbid cerebrospinal fluid, it was invariably injected immediately, once or twice a day. This was troublesome and carried the risk of complications such as serum sickness. The treatment period was invariably two to three weeks or more, and the mortality rate was above 30%. Although this was half the mortality rate of those not treated with serum, it was far from ideal. Since the advent of sulfonamide drugs, the treatment and prognosis of this disease have undergone a complete change. It is now universally recognized that sulfadiazine (i.e., Diazine) has low toxicity and high penetration into the cerebrospinal fluid, making it an excellent drug for this disease. However, sulfonamide and its derivatives, sulfapyridine and sulfathiazole, are also effective. Oral tablets are the preferred route. If the condition is severe or coma is present, intravenous, subcutaneous, or intrathecal injections are given. In this way, the condition often improves within two days and is completely cured in about a week, with the mortality rate reduced to below 10%. Penicillin has a therapeutic effect on the pathogen of this disease, but the concentration of penicillin in the cerebrospinal fluid after extra-spinal injection cannot reach effective levels. Even with simultaneous administration via both routes, the effect does not seem to be superior to Diazine. However, if Diazine is combined with intrathecal penicillin, a higher therapeutic effect is achieved. The success of treatment depends not only on the choice of drugs but also on other factors. It has already been mentioned that the prognosis is worse in early childhood (under three years of age) and in adults (over forty years of age), with acute fulminant forms and subcutaneous purpura. It also depends on the duration of the illness (the earlier the effective treatment, the better), the presence of complications (which can hopefully be reduced with rapid and effective treatment), and the response to treatment. If drug A is ineffective after three days, drug B should be substituted immediately. However, even if the results are good and recovery is normal, the drug should be continued for two or three days to prevent recurrence. No Artificial Immunization Method Requires Attention During Epidemics Because there is no artificial immunization method for this disease, it is quite cumbersome to control and prevent it during an epidemic. The following is a summary of relevant points from the American Public Health Association's "Control of Communicable Diseases" for reference: (1) Patient Management (A) Recognize the disease and report it to the local health authorities after bacterial testing of the blood and cerebrospinal fluid. (B) Isolate the patient strictly for fourteen days from the onset of the disease, restrict the activities of contacts until their nasopharyngeal swab culture is negative. (C) Disinfect nasal and throat secretions and items contaminated by the patient. (2) General Precautions (A) Pay attention to personal hygiene and avoid droplet transmission. (B) Prevent overcrowding in public places such as dormitories, factories, docks, and stations. (3) Personal Hygiene Pay attention to air circulation in residences and prevent cold and excessive fatigue, which can reduce resistance. According to the results of trials in the US garrison troops, it is believed that oral administration of 2 grams of Diazine per day for two days can significantly reduce the carrier rate. During a large epidemic of this disease, there were no patients within two months, while there was a strong contrast in the control group, suggesting that it could be adopted. However, implementation among the general public is difficult due to management challenges and inevitable re-exposure to carriers, resulting in less effectiveness. It can be used for reference but cannot be widely promoted. ### The Constitution Neglects the Right to Health Lu Jun The Constitution of the Republic of China was born amidst cheers of "Long live!" and was formally promulgated by the National Government in the new year. This newly born constitution is clearly much more progressive. People's rights and personal freedoms adopt the principle of respect and protection. Based on this principle, the happiness of the people will surely be greatly increased. The Constitution itself is largely unquestionable. The rights of the people are enumerated extensively, which is the crystallization of modern democracy. However, there is one major omission: the "right to health" has not been included. The neglect of health protection leaves an unpleasant feeling. If it is said that Article 15 of the Constitution already guarantees the people's right to subsistence, and adding the right to health would be superfluous, then the definitions of "right to subsistence" and "right to health" have not been clearly distinguished. Mr. Meng Wu, an authority on political science in our country, said: "The right to subsistence is the right of the people to receive the minimum living expenses from the state in order to ensure their survival." This is a kind of economic right, not the right to health. Even if we look closely at the article: "The people's right to subsistence, right to work, and right to property shall be guaranteed," it is purely a guarantee of the people's economic life, not a guarantee of a healthy life. It can be seen that the right to subsistence not only does not contain the meaning of the right to health but is purely two different things. Suppose that "right to subsistence" in that article can be interpreted broadly to include the meaning of health, then prisoners serving fixed-term sentences survive in dirty prisons. The hungry and cold poor survive in a state of neither freezing to death nor starving to death. Patients moan in bed. They are also surviving. But is this kind of survival meaningful, is it the realm of survival that we desire? It can be said that it is completely not. Because the benefit that this kind of right gives to the people is a political strategy of neither dying nor living. This is not true survival, let alone healthy survival. What we ask for is healthy survival. Therefore, demanding actual healthy survival is our expectation, not an empty check for the right to subsistence. In terms of the right to health, it is an active right. What the people demand is the enjoyment of health, and the state must effectively shoulder the obligation to implement it. The right to health that we are asking for now is holistic, that is, to maintain and promote the health of all people. It should be based on the principle of improving the people's health and improving the people's living environment, preventing and treating diseases, not just obtaining protection in the enjoyment of disease treatment, but obtaining the opportunity and right to a happy life. Only with health can we work, can we survive. Only healthy survival is true survival. Because in the 20th-century society, health is not only a personal matter but a collective business. For example, the control of infectious diseases and environmental sanitation facilities are beyond the reach of individual abilities. Collective joint efforts are required. Moreover, the people are the unit of national organization. Healthy people are the foundation for creating culture. Healthy people are the essential elements for national survival and development. Therefore, the right to health is not only the demand of the people but also the foundation of national survival. Confirming the right to health in the constitution is a quick strategy that should be adopted for the sake of the people's demands and for the survival of the country. In the past hundred years, the problems pursued and fought for by European and American civil rights politics have mostly been purely issues of personal security (Individual Secrulty). Since the end of the Weimar Constitution, the establishment and execution of security systems have been emphasized in Britain and the United States. President Roosevelt's "New Deal" measures and execution took the Security Law as the main part and stated that the people have the four major rights, including the right to health, which is now cited as the New Human Rights Charter. The four freedoms he advocated, including "Freedom from Want" and "Freedom from Fear," allow people from all countries in the world to truly live in happiness, freedom, and well-being in today's society. The Constitution of the World Health Organization (World Heaulth Organiaztion Constitution) believes that health is one of the important factors for achieving the safety and happiness of individuals and countries and recognizes the right to health as one of the basic rights of all mankind. The government is responsible for the health of the people. To fulfill this responsibility, it is necessary to provide the people with appropriate health facilities, determine the right to health, and guarantee it as a prerequisite. Unfortunately, this completely disappointed us. The current constitution neglects the provisions of the right to health, and its right to subsistence emphasizes economic life and is mostly passive. It is far from the ideal of social security advocated by modern developed countries, which is a great pity. But we hope that in the implementation of the constitution, special attention should be paid to this point, and efforts should be made to make up for it, which is a great blessing for a happy China.

(New York Times) ### Miscarriage is Not Such a Great Misfortune By Richard Singer Translated by Qin Wenqing Miscarriage is not such a great misfortune, but most women don't think so, because what is produced by a miscarriage is a fetus that can no longer maintain its own small life, and it is expelled from the body by the forces of nature, so miscarriage can be said to conform to the rule of "survival of the fittest." Generally speaking, miscarriage is the delivery of a stillborn infant, so we can use the word miscarriage to include all stillbirths aborted before ten months of pregnancy, but in medical terms, abortion before 16 weeks of pregnancy is called abortion, abortion between 16 and 28 weeks of pregnancy is called miscarriage, and abortion after 28 weeks of pregnancy before the delivery period is called premature labor. The number of miscarriages is difficult to count, because those who seek medical treatment in hospitals are already very dangerous dystocia; some experts also say that miscarriages account for one-fifth of all births, but in fact, it may be even greater than this number. So when a woman is pregnant, she has four-fifths of a chance of giving birth to a normal infant and one-fifth of a chance of miscarriage. Seventy-five percent of miscarriages occur in the third month of pregnancy (seven months before delivery). This type of miscarriage is the result of changes in the fetus itself. The death of the fetus is often the cause of miscarriage. In the late stages of pregnancy—the seventh to ninth months—the infant develops very quickly, and if a miscarriage occurs, other reasons need to be found to explain it. In fact, miscarriage is the action of natural forces to eliminate lives that are not suitable for survival. Obstetrics and gynecology authority Mall once said that in cases of early miscarriage, about 80% of fetuses must be abnormal. When the fetus develops to a certain extent, it is likely to become a "monster." For example, a fetus that has developed to full term but has only one hand, one foot, two heads, one eye, or other strange shapes cannot survive. Therefore, this type of young fetus is too far from a normal mature fetus to survive. The formation of these monsters may be the result of abnormal development of embryonic cells or the result of local changes in fetal development. For example, if the mother's oxygen supply is reduced, the fetus will develop abnormally, and if the mother's body temperature changes drastically, it can also cause developmental disorders and abnormal development. Vitamin E is very necessary for maintaining a normal fetus, and a lack of other vitamins can also cause miscarriage. Abnormal production of endocrine and abnormal secretion of normal endocrine can cause miscarriage. If this situation is discovered early, appropriate hormones can be supplemented to allow the fetus to develop to the delivery period under normal circumstances. Mechanical causes can cause fetal death—for example, twisting of the arteries that supply the fetus with nutrients, changes in the tissues inside the uterus that supply nutrients, reducing the supply of nutrients to the fetus, causing death. In theory, syphilis does not affect the early fetus, but it often causes premature birth. The health of the mother's body is very important for preventing miscarriage. Various acute infectious diseases can cause fetal death, and various poisoning—including phosgene—can also have the same result. Uterine tumors—such as common fibroid tumors—can prevent the fetus from receiving sufficient nutrients. When a woman has a miscarriage, she often curses physical stimulation and strong emotional effects—such as moving furniture or complaining about strong changes in temperature. Everyone also believes that it is related to the full moon, midnight dog barking, or fright. These reasons—severe muscle movement or falling—are more like stimulating reasons than absolute causes of miscarriage. Because a loud noise may urge production and cause abortion, but the aborted fetuses were originally already dead. It is generally believed that sexual intercourse in the early stages of pregnancy will cause the fetus to grow into a monster or cause abortion. This statement is unreliable. Sexual intercourse can be a stimulating reason, as mentioned above; of course, abstinence must be observed in the later stages of pregnancy, because sexual intercourse may bring infectious diseases into the reproductive tract; in fact, it is difficult to harm a healthy and normally developing fetus, because the fetus has natural defense mechanisms in the mother's body that allow it to develop normally. The father's role in causing miscarriage has recently attracted the attention of the medical community and has been proven by facts: the father's alcoholism or chronic (such as lead) poisoning can affect the sperm's vitality. Although it can proceed normally in the process of conception, it can affect the normal development of the fetus in the late stages of pregnancy. Eighty percent of the causes of miscarriage are abnormal fetal development, and the other 20% are not caused by abnormal protoplasm of embryonic cells but by external causes. If a woman has repeated miscarriages, modern doctors say that medical treatment can be used to prevent it. A woman who has repeated miscarriages must undergo a thorough examination by a qualified doctor. She may have abnormal uterine position; although nutritional deficiencies do not prevent conception, eating foods lacking nutrients can affect the vitality of embryonic tissues, so the fetus may develop to a certain extent and die. Taking vitamin E—such as wheat germ oil or wheat germ—can prevent various miscarriages. Miscarriage is not to say that the mother's negligence caused the fetus to die, nor is it to say that she is not suitable for production. It is just the natural elimination of stillbirths to correct abnormal development. If a woman has repeated miscarriages, this omen should not be taken as a judgment that she cannot produce. If she can pay attention, most of them can be cured and produce a normal infant. ### Beautiful Words from America (3) By Qiao Shumin 1.

Allen ### New Talk from the Medical World By Qiao Shumin Painless Childbirth Let me tell you a story first: "A pregnant woman had been in labor for many days, but the fetus would not come down. She was in constant pain, so she had to consult a doctor. The doctor took out his stethoscope and listened carefully. It turned out to be twins. Fetus A insisted that Fetus B come out first, but Fetus B insisted that Fetus A come out first. They could not agree after negotiating, so they started fighting while talking. Later, they simply stopped talking and started a full-scale brawl, which made the mother, who had been sick for eight years and suffered from severe anemia, feel excruciating pain and almost die. The doctor tried to persuade them again and again, but no one would listen. It was clear that both sides were suffering, and the mother was also in excruciating pain. She had no choice but to pull them out with forceps, regardless of their feelings. They were already half-dead, and the mother's vitality was also greatly damaged. It took her many years of recuperation to gradually stand up." Historically, everyone has believed that labor pain is an unavoidable process of childbirth, and that the "birth of a dragon" must involve severe pain. However, in scientifically advanced countries, labor pain is no longer necessary. It is not only "unnecessary" but also "undesirable." If you don't believe it, let's take a look at the recent statistics from Pennsylvania Hospital in the United States. Ever since obstetricians adopted "ether" as an anesthetic a century ago, scientists have been seeking a more suitable anesthetic to reduce the pain of childbirth for women, without stopping the function of uterine contractions. Because uterine contractions are the original power to push out the fetus. Over the years, countless anesthetics have been tested, and some have been more successful, but even if they are harmless to the mother, they are inevitably harmful to the fetus. It was not until 1942 that two doctors, Hingson and Edwards, adopted a new method called "Continuous Cau al Analgesia" to eliminate the pain of childbirth for women. It is beneficial to the mother and harmless and beneficial to the fetus. In recent years, this method has been promoted vigorously throughout the United States, truly benefiting women and infants a lot. The anesthetic they use is not novocaine or a common anesthetic, but "Metycaine," which can be injected slowly from the beginning of labor pain or when it just starts, until childbirth is completed or postpartum repair surgery is completed. The excellent results of this method have been continuously reported in the literature, but the collection of sufficient material and rigorous statistical analysis and evaluation was still done in November 1946. It was done by S. D. Collins, director of statistics of the US Department of Health, and his colleagues, together with Dr. Hingson and others of Pennsylvania Hospital, who compared and contrasted 2,516 cases of pregnant women (2,546 infants) who used the new anesthesia method in the hospital from 1943 to 1945 with 1,024 cases of pregnant women (1,034 infants) who used the old method in 1942, based on their race, age, parity, labor process, pregnancy period, hospitalization period, past medical history, complications, infant birth weight, stillbirths, live births, and other related items. The detailed numbers and charts may not be of interest to all readers, so I will translate and report the important ones to the readers. 1. Among the pregnant women who used the new anesthetic: more than 90% had no labor pain; 5% had a reduction in labor pain; and 5% had no effect, partly due to technical problems. 2. Among the pregnant women who used the new anesthetic, about one-third of the pregnant women had a short-term decrease in blood pressure, but it did not hinder the pregnant women, and their mortality rate was less than one in a thousand, while the old method had two in a thousand. 3. On average, pregnant women who used the new anesthetic had a shorter labor process, a shorter hospital stay, better postpartum uterine contractions, fewer postpartum uterine pains, less bleeding, and more lochia than the old method. 4. Pregnant women who used the new anesthetic had fewer stillbirths, and the infant mortality rate was also lower. (The mortality rate of newborns within seven days was halved by the new method compared to the old method!) In short, this new method of painless childbirth not only allows most pregnant women to be painless, but also makes pregnant women safer. It not only makes pregnant women safer, but also makes fetuses and infants safer. Is labor pain an unavoidable process of childbirth? We have obtained a negative answer. Fetuses are full of blood and energy, ignorant and ignorant. It is impossible for you to explain this truth to them, and they will not understand or listen. But I want to say to mothers: you are the ones who suffer the pain yourself, and you are the masters of your own destiny. Why not collectively adopt progressive, civilized, peaceful, and safe methods to save yourself and the fetus? (Editor's note: The First Hospital of the Red Cross Society and Zhongshan Hospital in this city are studying the adoption of this method.)

### The Destroyed Writer of Spring and Autumn By Gorky Translated by Shi Heng One night, in a small tavern, in the smoky atmosphere of a half-drunk, half-awake, ignorant crowd, a young man who had been tormented by life said to me: "My life was destroyed by that telegraph operator, Malashin." He lowered his head, wearing a wrinkled knight's hat, looked under the table, moved his lame leg with both hands, and let out a long sigh: "Yes, destroyed by that telegraph operator, Malashin. Our pastor usually called him 'the youth with the sacred face,' the girls called him 'Malasha,' he was a small boy, with rosy cheeks, brown eyes, black eyebrows, and a pair of feminine hands—beautiful as a painting. In our small town, he was always cheerful and lovely to everyone, he was spoiled by everyone, even loved, we, the 3,500 residents of the small town, happily accepted the daily hard work that fell on human destiny. "When I was twenty-three years old, I was full of life's weariness, and even my soul was paralyzed; the small disturbances of the world made me nervous, even fearful. I didn't understand the meaning of it at all, I looked at everything around me almost in a state of embarrassment. Once, because of a momentary impulse, an inspiration, I wrote a novel, titled 'How People Live,' and sent the manuscript to the 'Niva' magazine. A week, a month, two months passed, and finally I no longer hoped that the editor would write to me. 'He receives too much and likes too little,' I said to myself. "Then, about three months later, I met Malashin: 'I received a postcard sent to you,' he said, handing me a postcard, on which was written: 'Your novel does not arouse any special interest in readers, so it cannot be considered successful; but it can be seen that you have considerable writing talent. Please send more manuscripts.' "You can imagine how happy this made me. Malashin told me with great interest that your postcard had been in his pocket for three days. 'I carry it with me,' he said, 'I wanted to give it to you, but I always forgot. So you are writing and want to become another Count Tolstoy!' "We laughed for a while and then separated. But that night, as I was walking home, the church deacon was sitting at the window and called out to me, 'Hello, you writer! I'm going to show you what I'm made of!' he said, shaking his fist at me. In my joy, I misunderstood his gesture towards me. I knew the church deacon as an old friend. In his youth, he had yearned to sing in operettas, but he only stood in the third row of the choir at most and never progressed. He wanted to write operettas in his hometown, but because the script was too exaggerated, he didn't succeed either. He liked to drink, and whenever he got drunk, he would bet that he could break walnuts with his forehead; once, he broke a whole pound of walnuts in one go, so the skin on his forehead was completely broken. He usually carried a tin can in his pocket, filled with frogs in summer and mice in winter. If he got a good opportunity, he would throw those little animals into the fur coats of noble ladies. These pranks were often forgiven because of his cheerful nature and his knowledge of the temperament of fish—he was an excellent fisherman! He didn't eat fish himself, for fear that the fish bones would get stuck in his throat, but he distributed the fish he caught to his acquaintances, so his friends gradually increased. "At this time, you see, I was still walking my way, happy about the letter I received. At that time, I was a humble young man, by nature fond of contemplation, but my appearance was indeed a bit strange..." He twirled the sparse beard between his lips, closed his dull eyes, and poured himself a glass of vodka with a trembling hand. When he was twenty years old, he must have been a clumsy, slender man; his disheveled gray hair must have been red, his dull eyes flashing blue light, and his face full of freckles. Now, his loose cheeks were covered with red blood vessels, and his purple, wine-soaked nose hung sadly on his sparse beard. That glass of vodka could not cheer him up, and he seemed to be speaking very hard in the silence. "I regarded myself as a handsome man, a prominent man, in fact, I was too conceited! My soul was singing like a lark. I began to write enthusiastically, all night long; my writing flowed like a torrent, how happy it was! However, I began to notice that no matter where I went, no matter when, the people in the town looked at me with special eyes, and I thought, they are jealous!... "One day Malashin invited me to the tax collector's house for tea. This family had a daughter, a young and pretty daughter. He can of course distinguish art from evil, but you can't distinguish salt from sugar! What's the reason?' "I felt very disturbed, and my feelings of self-esteem quickly sank. 'This is of course a joke,' I said. "They laughed even louder. Secondly, they all encouraged me to recite a few verses of poetry—I had also tried writing poetry, Malashin knew. "'Poets always recite their poems at social gatherings, so you must also recite.' "At this time, the son of a dull-faced military officer objected: 'Good poems can only be written by people in the army.' "The young ladies began to argue with him about this, and in the midst of the chaos, I secretly slipped away.' "From that night on, everyone in the town wanted to trap me, as if I were a strange animal. The following Sunday, I met the church deacon, carrying a fishing rod and stepping like an elephant. "'Stop,' he shouted; 'You are writing, aren't you, you fool! I have been training operettas here for about three years,' he continued, 'but I am still no match for you. What exactly are you? You are just a fly. A fly like you can only dirty the mirror of literature, you skunk!' He scolded me so badly that I was unbearable. Why did he have to do this? I wondered. "Not long after this, my aunt—I was an orphan, and I usually lived with my aunt—came and said to me: 'Everyone is talking about what exactly you are doing. You are writing? You'd better not do this kind of thing; you have reached the age to marry.' I tried to explain to her that writing is not bad, even counts and dukes write, it is completely a clean activity. At the same time, they also invited several young people. Everyone who knew me came over and said to me: 'You are writing articles, aren't you? Would you like some sugar in your tea?' 'Ha, I thought, they are all giving me sugar! I stirred the sugar in my cup and tasted it. It was strange, what was going on, because the tea was salty—in fact, very spicy. But I still drank it, I was so ashamed at the time. Then suddenly, they all burst into laughter, and Malashin, raising his face, said to me: "'What's going on? A writer's profession is a noble profession.' She didn't listen to me and started crying, saying: 'My God, what kind of filthy thing taught you to play this trick?' "The next day Malashin met me on the street and shouted loudly, 'Good morning, Little Count Tolstoy!' He made up a boring song for me, and as soon as the children in the town saw me on the street, they would sing it together. 'All the little birds, all the canaries, sadly sing of the past, but, I dare say, their singing, doesn't get them a penny.' "I thought, let these all go away, it seems that writing has caused me irreparable trouble! Finally, I simply didn't dare to show my face on the street—they were all looking for trouble with me. That church deacon was particularly angry and ready to hit me at any time. 'I worked hard for three years,' he roared; 'but you, you servant, you...' "I often sat by the river at night, wondering why they all did this, what exactly was going on. On the other side of the river, there was a quiet, secluded place—a small island, a grove; I would climb there, looking at the stream, as if I felt that the black water, filtered from the town, washed over my soul, leaving behind a bitter and filthy aftertaste. "I had a girlfriend, an embroidery woman, I wooed her with the utmost respect, and I believed that she would accept my proposal. But she also gradually troubled me, distrustfully asking me, 'Did you really write about us in the newspaper, about the things in the town?' "'Who told you?' "At first, she refused to answer, but finally she admitted it and said: 'Malashin got your manuscript. He read it to everyone, and everyone made fun of you, saying that you have surpassed Count Tolstoy. Why did you give your writing to Malashin?' "The earth was shaking under my feet. Damned thing! I thought, this is really bad—I wrote a lot about the tax collector and the church deacon in that novel, but I didn't expect them to feel particularly unhappy! Therefore, that church deacon... Of course, I never gave my treasures to Malashin; he just stole them from the post office. At this time, my lover added to my sadness, saying: "'My friends all make fun of me for walking with you... I really don't know what to do...' "Let all of you go away! I thought. But I went to find Malashin. "'Please return the manuscript to me,' I said. "'What do you want it for?' he said coldly, 'No one wants it anymore.' I couldn't make him return it to me. In fact, I noticed that a useless article is usually more precious than a useful one, just as a mischievous person is more pleasing than others. A cart horse is never as precious in a person's heart as a race horse, although people live by hard work rather than racing. "Not long after that, Christmas came. Malashin and I participated in a fancy dress dance. I dressed up as a demon, they put two goat horns on my leather hat, and covered my face with a mask. Oh, we danced and did some boring things; finally, covered in sweat, I found that my face was hurting painfully. I decided to go home, but on the way, three clowns caught me and shouted: 'Demon! Beat him down!' "I picked up my feet and ran, but they caught me and started punching

### The Three-Person Committee and the Military Mediation Department: The Government Announces Their Dissolution, Expressing Sincere Gratitude to General Marshall

[United Press, Nanjing, 30th] The National Government today formally announced the dissolution of the Three-Person Committee and the General Headquarters of Military Mediation, as these mediation mechanisms can no longer function. Furthermore, various circles in Nanjing are not surprised by the withdrawal of the United States from the Three-Person Committee and the General Headquarters of Military Mediation, ending its mediation efforts and allowing China to resolve its internal affairs itself. It is generally believed that this is the inevitable result after General Marshall's return to Washington and the demise of all hopes for peace.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, Day] The Central Propaganda Department issued a statement from the National Government on January Day as follows: "Chairman Chiang has received a notification from Dr. Stuart that the United States government has decided to terminate its relationship with the Three-Person Committee and the Executive Headquarters of Military Mediation in Peiping. In the past three months, our government has made various efforts for peace talks, originally hoping that the Three-Person Committee and the Military Mediation Department would not be forced to abandon their work. Unfortunately, all proposals of our government have been rendered ineffective due to the stubborn refusal of the Chinese Communists. Our government now has no way to continue to maintain the mediation mechanism with the participation of third parties, which is a matter of great regret. The government expresses its deep gratitude for the efforts and hardships endured by General Marshall and the American personnel of the Military Mediation Department in the past year."

[Our Newspaper, Peiping, 30th] Tsai Wen-chih, Chief of Staff of the government side of the Military Mediation Department, issued a statement today regarding the withdrawal of American personnel, stating in brief: Since the establishment of the Executive Headquarters of Military Mediation a year ago, the Communist Party has failed to implement the armistice agreement, the troop reorganization agreement, and the restoration of transportation methods, undermining the mediation efforts. Therefore, despite repeated concessions and forbearance by the government, the military mediation work still could not be effectively carried out. Therefore, the United States decided to withdraw from the Executive Headquarters of Mediation. However, we express our heartfelt gratitude for the efforts of American friends and American personnel of the Executive Headquarters to achieve peace in China, especially to General Marshall, General Gillem, and Mr. Robertson and General Bedell Smith, who participated in the mediation in the past, for their commendable efforts to assist in China's peace, to whom we will always pay our respects.

[Our Newspaper, Peiping, Day] General Gillem convened the Chiefs of Staff of both the government and the Chinese Communist Party at 3:30 pm yesterday to notify them of the American withdrawal, thanking the government and the Chinese Communist Party for their cooperation and understanding in the past year. Finally, he stated: He hopes that this American mediation can ultimately open a path for peace in China.

[Our Newspaper, Peiping, Day] The highest American authority of the Military Mediation Department stated: The withdrawal is due to "environmental" reasons, but believes that there will definitely be other "alternative methods" in the future to complete the task of the Executive Headquarters. However, the spokesman did not respond to reporters' requests to explain other "alternative methods." The spokesman also stated: As of now, he has only received orders to withdraw the personnel of the Military Mediation Department, including approximately 2,000 people working on documents, not including drivers. The American military observation group in Yenan and the American liaison group in Harbin are also on the list of withdrawals. When reporters asked whether some American troops had provided transportation and supply services to the Executive Headquarters in the past, and whether they would also withdraw with the American personnel of the Executive Headquarters, the spokesman did not give a clear answer, only repeatedly stating that he had received the order for the withdrawal of American personnel from the Executive Headquarters. When reporters asked how the American assistance to China's prisoner-of-war work, which had not been fully completed, would be carried out in the future, the spokesman replied that the American side believed that its mission in prisoner-of-war work had been completed, and the remaining work should be actively handled by the Chinese government and financial authorities. When reporters asked whether the American side still intends to participate in China's mediation work in the future, he replied that this matter must be decided by Washington. When asked about the reasons for the failure of the Military Mediation Department, he replied, please read Marshall's statement carefully. As for the withdrawal of American personnel, the spokesman said: From last night to today, because no further instructions have been received, only general preparations have been made, such as the withdrawal of personnel and the disposal of remaining materials, which will need to be decided slowly. The highest American authority of the Military Mediation Department received twelve Chinese reporters at 5 pm this afternoon, which lasted for 40 minutes.

### Personnel from the Chinese Communist Side Will Leave Peiping Within a Week; The Military Mediation Department Will Discuss Ending Work

[Associated Press, Peiping, 30th] The Chinese Communist representative of the Military Mediation Department in Peiping announced that they will leave Peiping within a week, with a total of 70 male and female staff members, who will retreat to Yenan and Handan in southern Hebei. The 13 Chinese Communist representatives in the Changchun branch will withdraw to Harbin. Zheng Jiemin, a government member of the Military Mediation Department, is currently in Nanjing and has not yet telegraphed his Chief of Staff, Tsai Wen-chih, to disband the government branch.

[Our Newspaper, Peiping, 30th] The Chinese Communist spokesman for the Military Mediation Department stated: After receiving the American notification of withdrawal yesterday, the Chinese Communist side urgently telegraphed Yenan overnight to ask for instructions on their future actions, which will depend on the orders from Yenan. After General Gillem convened the meeting yesterday, the American personnel immediately guaranteed the safety of the Chinese Communist personnel during their withdrawal. The highest American official also stated today when receiving reporters: The American side has asked the Chinese Communist side what they need during their withdrawal, and the American side will provide assistance. According to relevant sources, the Military Mediation Department will hold another meeting within the next week to discuss the end and clearing of work.

[Our Newspaper, Peiping, 30th] The American liaison groups in Yenan and Harbin will also be dismantled at the same time.

### Mei Yi and Chen Jiakang Speak Separately in Nanjing and Shanghai

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 30th] Mei Yi of the Communist Party Office stated on the 30th regarding the American government's announcement of its withdrawal from the Military Mediation Department and the Three-Person Committee: The Three-Person Committee, chaired by Marshall, and the American-participated Military Mediation Department, never stopped the Kuomintang from tearing up the armistice agreement, nor did they say a fair word, resulting in such a tragic end this month, which is not unexpected. Even if the United States does so, it cannot shirk its responsibility for fueling the Chinese civil war. However, the cancellation of the Military Mediation Department will not affect the Kuomintang's large-scale offensive against the liberated areas in the current situation.

[Central News Agency, City News] Chen Jiakang, Director of the Chinese Communist Party Office in Shanghai, made a statement yesterday in his personal capacity regarding Minister Peng's statement and the American statement on terminating relations with the Three-Person Committee, stating: The Chinese Communist Party naturally cannot interfere with the government's unilateral actions of convening the National Assembly alone and reorganizing it alone. It is still difficult to judge the impact of the reorganization on all parties. However, under any circumstances, the Chinese Communist Party will remain firm on the two conditions it has proposed. The American withdrawal from the Three-Person Committee marks the end of Marshall's mediation efforts. However, this move does not indicate that the United States is adopting a non-intervention policy towards China. Judging only from the American troop withdrawal this time, the American Navy is not withdrawing, and the American military advisers are not withdrawing, and there is no reason for these two to continue to stay in China. As for the departure or retention of the Chinese Communist delegation, he said that it depends on the government's intentions.

### Kuomintang Spokesman's Thoughts on the American Troop Withdrawal

[Our Newspaper News] Sun Binyi, spokesman of the Democratic Socialist Party, expressed his thoughts on the American withdrawal from the Military Mediation Department and the withdrawal of American military personnel from North China as follows: The American withdrawal from the Military Mediation Department and the Three-Person Committee is a natural result after General Marshall's departure from China, and may also indicate that the United States has abandoned its policy of unilaterally mediating our internal war. As for the withdrawal of American troops, in principle, the troops of any country should not be stationed in a foreign country for a long time, but some people who regard the American military presence in China as an imperialist policy are also excessively biased. Because the American military has made valuable contributions to our country in prisoner-of-war work during the war and after the victory. In terms of US-Soviet relations and from a world political point of view, the withdrawal of American troops increases favorable influences and can also be seen as preparation for the United States to participate in the Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference.

### The Ambassador's Status Remains Unchanged

[United States Information Service, Washington, 29th] A State Department spokesman said: The order to withdraw the US Marines protecting the Peiping Military Mediation Department will be issued soon. The announcement does not mean that the status of US Ambassador to China, Stuart, will change in any way.
