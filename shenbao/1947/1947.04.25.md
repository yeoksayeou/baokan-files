### The Government Committee is the Highest Decision-Making Body; the National Defense Committee Announces its Dissolution; Staff Members are Dismissed with Severance Pay as Usual

[Our Correspondent, Nanjing, 24th] The Supreme National Defense Council will cease accepting documents from the 24th and is in the process of concluding its affairs, expected to be fully completed by the end of this month. Furthermore, the Central Political Committee has already commenced operations at the original location of the National Defense Council.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 24th] With the reorganization and establishment of the National Government Committee, the powers of the Supreme National Defense Council have been transferred. An official announcement has been issued, declaring its dissolution. The council was established in Chongqing in January of the 28th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1939], and during the War of Resistance, it exercised the powers of the Central Political Committee, deciding on the highest national policies, achieving remarkable accomplishments over ten years. However, the council's predecessor can be traced back to the Central Political Conference, making its history twenty-three years to date. The Central Political Conference was established in Guangzhou in the 13th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1924]. It was not until the Fifth National Congress of the Kuomintang in the 24th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1935] that a resolution was passed to reorganize it into the Central Political Committee. In the 26th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1937], with the outbreak of the War of Resistance, it was decided to suspend the powers of the Central Political Committee and transform it into the Supreme National Defense Council to replace it. At the same time, the National Defense Advisory Council was established as an auxiliary body, broadly inviting individuals from various sectors to participate. This later evolved into the National Political Council, which is now the highest organ of public opinion in the nation. After the victory of the War of Resistance, the Kuomintang convened the Second Plenary Session of its Sixth Central Committee, resolving that the National Government should be the highest organ for deciding national affairs and deciding to abolish the Supreme National Defense Council. Subsequently, the Central Committee decided that the council should be dissolved on the day of the reorganization and establishment of the National Government. Now that the reorganization of the National Government is completed, and the National Government Committee has also been established, the council should be dissolved accordingly. The Secretariat of the council has already issued a public notice, ceasing to accept documents from today and commencing the winding-up process. It is understood that the staff of the council will be reassigned to different positions and given severance pay according to past precedents issued by the Central Party Headquarters, distributed according to their years of service. It is rumored that the original location of the council at Dingjiaqiao will soon be transferred to the Central Political Committee for use.

First Meeting of the Political Affairs Committee

[Our Correspondent, Nanjing, 24th] The Political Affairs Committee of the Executive Yuan is scheduled to hold its first meeting on the 29th. Zhang Qun arrived at the Yuan at 9:00 AM on the 24th to assume office and immediately announced the appointment of Liang Yingwen, Fu Zhuangping, and Zhou Junliang as Counselors of the Executive Yuan, Feng Fei as Confidential Secretary with the rank of Recommended Appointment, and Zhao Yinglun as Chief of the General Affairs Section. It is also reported that Hu Shanheng, the Chief Accountant of the Executive Yuan, will be transferred to the Directorate General of Budgets, Accounts and Statistics as a Comptroller, with Chen Kewen, the head of the Deliberations Section, succeeding him in the vacated position.

[Our Correspondent, Nanjing, 24th] The newly appointed Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan, Gan Naiguang, stated today that future work will focus on efficiency, and several principles will be established for colleagues to follow. Furthermore, Gan's affairs during his tenure at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs have not yet been completed and are currently being expedited.

[Our Correspondent, Nanjing, 24th] Chen Qitian of the Youth Party spoke to reporters today on the issues of democracy and civil war, stating that the reorganization of the government is the beginning of China's democratic politics, and whether democracy can be realized depends on whether all parties have a democratic spirit. There are many reasons for today's civil war, but the main one is that there is too little democratic element. He hopes that all parties can lay down their arms in order to achieve the goal of democracy. He himself is a peace advocate. The civil war is spreading throughout the country, and the people cannot bear the suffering. If the Communist Party is willing to make peace and restore national transportation, but the civil war continues, then this is a matter between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. If the Communist Party is unwilling to lay down its arms and unwilling to restore national transportation, then this responsibility should be borne by the Communist Party, which is also a matter between the new government and the Communist Party.

[Our Correspondent, Nanjing, 24th] The Youth Party held a full-day meeting on the 24th to discuss internal issues. The list of candidates for the remaining Political Affairs Committee member, the two Vice Ministers of Agriculture and Economic Affairs, and the participants from twelve provinces and seven special municipalities, which the party has not yet submitted, will be decided only after Zuo, Chen, and others go to Shanghai and convene the party's Central Standing Committee. Zuo and others plan to travel to Shanghai on the night train on the 25th, and Li Huang is scheduled to arrive in Nanjing on the 28th. According to Zuo, the party headquarters will not move to Nanjing.

[Our Correspondent, Nanjing, 24th] The newly appointed Minister of Agriculture and Forestry, Zuo Shunsheng, met with reporters on the evening of the 24th and stated that the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry's policy plans already have a comprehensive plan from the government; he does not intend to make any changes. At the same time, he does not intend to change the existing technical personnel of the ministry. As for the candidates for the two Vice Ministers, the Permanent and Political Vice Ministers, they have not yet been determined. Furthermore, the former Minister of Agriculture and Forestry, Zhou Yichun, visited Zuo today but did not meet him.

### The Legislative Yuan Held an All-Day Meeting Yesterday; the Banking Law Passed its Third Reading; Zhang Qun to Attend the Next Regular Meeting to Report

[Our Correspondent, Nanjing, 24th] The Legislative Yuan held its 323rd regular meeting yesterday, the 24th, in the morning and afternoon, presided over by President Sun. Important bills were passed, including the Banking Law and the Organizational Statute of the National Assembly Representative and Legislative Yuan Member Election General Office. The Organizational Statute of the National Economic Commission was also brought up during the meeting, but because some members argued that since the government has been reorganized, it is necessary to consult the new Executive Yuan on its views on the commission, it was decided to postpone the discussion until the next regular meeting. Furthermore, the Legislative Yuan's 324th regular meeting is scheduled to be held on May 1st, at which time the new Premier of the Executive Yuan, Zhang Qun, will attend to explain the policy direction and answer various inquiries.

[Our Correspondent, Nanjing, 24th] The Banking Law was passed its third reading at the Legislative Yuan's 323rd regular meeting on the morning of the 24th, completing the legislative process. The Organizational Statute of the Central Trust Bureau was also passed at the same time. According to reports, the draft of the Banking Law was thoroughly studied and revised during the previous regular meeting and passed its first reading at the meeting. However, because the Bankers Association raised some concerns and hoped they could be adopted, it was decided to retain the second reading procedure and bring it up for discussion at this meeting. After the bill was presented at the meeting today, Zhang Yiyuan, the original drafter, first reported on the opinions of the banking industry on the bill, explaining the points that the banking industry hoped for. Based on Zhang's report, the main points were discussed, and Article 51, "The credit extension of a business firm shall not exceed 20% of its total deposits," was changed to "25%." In Article 51, "A specialized bank may make loans secured by real estate, but the total amount of such loans shall not exceed 10% of its total deposits," was increased to "15%." Article 93, paragraph 2, "A native bank that has been approved for business registration before the promulgation and implementation of this law shall be renamed a bank if its capital meets the requirements of Article 19, paragraph 1," was changed to "may be renamed a bank." The provision in Article 97 regarding native banks not being allowed to establish branch banks was deleted, largely adopting the opinions of the banking industry.

When the Organizational Statute of the Central Trust Bureau was presented, Jian Guanzan and others advocated that the bill be postponed for study and discussed when the China Banking Law was presented. Liu Butong and Wei Tingsheng believed that the business of the Central Trust Bureau was important and should not be delayed. After a clause-by-clause discussion with slight revisions, it was passed. The main change was: The public reserve fund drawn from the net profit of the Central Trust Bureau in each fiscal year was originally set at 50%, but it has now been changed to 30%. Peng Chunshi requested that the fourth item of the bureau's business, "the government," be removed, but it was decided to maintain the original proposal.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 24th] The Legislative Yuan continued its meeting from 3:30 PM to 5:00 PM this afternoon, presided over by President Sun, to discuss the following bills: (1) The Finance Committee, in conjunction with the Economic Committee, reported on the examination of the Draft Special Business Tax Law and the Draft Amendment to the Business Tax Law, and it was resolved to pass the amendment. (2) The Legal System Committee, in conjunction with the Local Autonomy Law Committee, reported on the examination of the amendment to Article 16 of the Provincial Assembly Organizational Statute, which would change provincial assembly members to salaried positions.

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 24th] Further details have been obtained here regarding the assassination of Communist Army leader Lin Biao, as follows: On the 28th of last month, Lin Biao convened a meeting of senior Northeast Communist Army cadres in Harbin to review future work guidelines. Lin Biao advocated fighting to the end, while Li Tianyou proposed the following five points: (1) The Council of Foreign Ministers failed to discuss matters concerning the Chinese Communist Party; (2) Failure to meet the requirements of a certain country, so there is no hope for future assistance from that country; (3) The losses in the battles of Siping Street, Dehui, Jiutai, and Nongan were too great, and no progress was made; (4) After the fall of Yan'an, there is no guarantee of victory; (5) The necessities of life are gradually decreasing. Based on the above situation, efforts should be made to resolve the issue peacefully. Lin Biao failed to answer his questions and said that Li had a rebellious heart, saying that in every offensive, the Koreans were the first to fail (Li is Korean), and that it must be under Li's instructions and should be severely punished according to law. At this time, Li's confidant, seeing Li in distress, suddenly fired two shots at Lin Biao, hitting Lin's lower abdomen. Lin's guards immediately shot Li's confidant dead and sent Lin to Nangang Municipal Hospital. The hospital was unable to treat him, and he was transferred to the Jewish Hospital on Wudao Street the next day. After the hospital's director, Gou Loubeifu, performed surgery, he died after lingering for a day and a night. The body was placed in the hospital's basement ice cellar.

People in the Chinese government also said that they were unaware of the claim that the United States had changed its loan policy towards China. Although they did not formally deny it, they did not believe it was possible that a portion of the loan had been granted to China.

[Another Dispatch] According to reports here, a senior official of the Ministry of Finance stated that the government is currently drafting plans to use the US$500 million loan earmarked for China for transportation equipment.

### Chen Yi Answers Reporters' Questions, Taiwan Governor-General's Office Hastens Handover Pacification Work Expected to be Completed by the End of This Month

[Central News Agency, Taipei, 24th] Chen Yi answered the following questions at a press conference at 3:00 p.m. today:

(Question) The outside world criticizes the Governor-General's Office for being too lenient in politics and too strict in economics. What is Governor Chen's opinion?

(Answer) The Central Government believes that Taiwan has been occupied for half a century and the situation is different from other provinces. It has decided not to pursue those who participated in the Imperial Rule Assistance Association during the Japanese era, so it has to be lenient in politics. As for the economy, people have different views. I think there is nothing wrong with it. And in a helpless situation where we can neither request financial assistance from the Central Government nor intend to increase the people's taxes, if we do not operate public enterprises, there will be no way for finance and it will be difficult to promote construction work. Then Taiwan will not have the current situation. And I have not neglected private enterprises. I originally intended to open up public company stocks and focus on subsidizing private enterprises.

(Question) What is the current security situation?

(Answer) There is no worry about the security of the whole province. Now only Taipei is worse. Tax revenue in other counties and cities has recovered, and there are fewer thefts. There are not many bandits hiding in the mountains. Young students have all returned. All pacification work is expected to be completed by the end of April.

(Question) Can provincial, county, and city councilors who participated in the February 28 Incident and have now repented and reformed still be councilors?

(Answer) We are studying it. There is no answer yet.

(Question) When will Chairman Wei come to Taiwan?

(Answer) He will come to Taiwan in a week or two. We are speeding up the handover procedures here.

### Ninety-Eight Groups of Anti-Tax Associations Petition Hong Kong Revises Direct Tax Law Tax Rate Remains the Same, Taxable Portion Reduced

[Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 23rd] The Hong Kong and Kowloon Committee Against Direct Taxes passed a resolution on the afternoon of the 23rd to send a telegram to the British Colonial Department requesting that the Hong Kong government stop collecting direct taxes. The committee also decided to convene representatives of the 98 groups participating in the anti-tax movement at noon on the 24th to petition the Governor's Office and the Legislative Council.

[Reuters, Hong Kong, 20th] Due to the opposition of Chinese merchants to the direct tax system and their scheduled petition to the Governor today, the Hong Kong government has made revisions to the direct tax law submitted to the Legislative Council. The standard tax rate remains at 10%, but the personal allowance has increased from 50 yuan to 7,000 yuan per year, the spouse allowance has increased from 4,000 yuan to 5,000 yuan per year, the child allowance is 2,000 yuan per year for each of the first and second children, 1,000 yuan per year for each of the third and fourth children, and 300 yuan per year for each child from the fifth child onwards. All of the above allowances are exempt from direct tax. In addition, the property repair allowance is also set at 20% of the income and can be tax-exempt. Before the revision, it was estimated that the annual direct tax revenue could reach 12,000,000 yuan. After the revision, due to the reduction of the taxable portion, the tax revenue will inevitably be greatly reduced, especially benefiting those with lower salaries.

[Reuters, Hong Kong, 24th] A delegation from the Chinese Committee Against Direct Taxes called on Hong Kong Governor Young at noon today and submitted a petition, the content of which was similar to the letter sent by the committee to British Colonial Minister Jones yesterday, which stated that the Chinese do not oppose the principle of taxation, but feel that the collection method is not in line with Chinese customs. It is said that the Governor has agreed to have the Legislative Council discuss the matter. The members of the Committee Against Direct Taxes are mostly members of Chinese merchant associations.

### National Defense Ministry's Troop慰勞 Group Arrives in Xi'an from Southern Shandong

### Qingdao Yizhong Cigarette Factory Shuts Down

[United Press, Qingdao, 24th] The Yizhong Cigarette Factory here has now shut down, which is the first tragedy of the civil war for commerce. The factory was the British American Tobacco Company before the war. It was established for more than 30 years and usually employed about 2,000 people. Before the war, its various brands of cigarettes were sold in North China and as far as Shaanxi and Gansu. It did not stop production even under Japanese management during the war. After the war, the factory was returned to its original owner and was intact. The reason why it is now forced to shut down is firstly because the Jiaoji Railway was destroyed by the Chinese Communist troops, cutting off the sales route to the interior of Shandong, and secondly because cigarettes from Shanghai and the United States are pouring into Qingdao, taking away the factory's market share. However, the factory has not yet dismissed its employees and is still paying living expenses.

### Japan's First Batch of Reparations Materials Distribution Quantity Undecided Allied Headquarters Compensation Expert Denies Shanghai Rumors

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 23rd] Shanghai previously reported that China would receive 600 tons of materials in the first batch of reparations materials, including machine factories, chemical factories, and a shipyard. Compensation experts at Allied Headquarters believe that such rumors are premature. Compensation experts pointed out that the distribution to the countries requesting compensation has not yet been decided, but it is generally known that China will receive half of the 30% provisional compensation. Personnel at Allied Headquarters told the Central News Agency reporter that a list of factories as initial compensation will be drafted soon, and the distribution can be decided soon. Compensation experts at Allied Headquarters also believe that Shanghai's report that the Chinese Ministry of Communications has concentrated ships to prepare for the transportation of all reparations materials is overly optimistic. They also told reporters that the dismantling, packing, and transportation of Japanese industrial equipment have not yet begun. The Japanese will need several months to install their factory equipment and transport it to various ports to wait for shipment.

Editorial

### Starting from Wallace's Speech

Former U.S. Vice President Henry Wallace has been touring European countries, giving speeches everywhere, criticizing President Truman's policies, and alarmingly stating that a third world war is inevitable. This has not only made a profound impression in various European countries, but has also caused serious repercussions in the United States. Looking at the current world situation from these controversies, we feel even more bewildered. However, French Socialist Party leader Léon Blum published an article in the People's Daily the day before yesterday, expressing his views on the current world situation: Firstly, he believes that the United States does not want war, and a third world war will not break out; Secondly, he believes that the difference between Wallace and President Truman lies in the methods, while their goals are the same - everyone is creating and consolidating world peace. We feel that the views of the French Socialist Party leader largely coincide with our views on the current world situation. Recently, opinions in the public opinion circle regarding international issues seem to be very complex, and there is a need to seriously examine the reality.

These past few days can be said to be the darkest period internationally. In Moscow, the Four Foreign Ministers Conference has become deadlocked and cannot extricate itself, and it is expected to end unhappily, causing those who yearn for peace to feel disheartened. In Washington, the House and Senate have been discussing the plan to aid Greece and Turkey, filled with an atmosphere of anti-communism. Looking at U.S.-Soviet relations, there is also a trend of worsening. Although it cannot be said that war is imminent, such developments are ultimately harmful to world peace. Therefore, how can the U.S. and the Soviet Union be reconciled and how can the creation of world peace be successful? This is indeed the most serious problem currently, and it is urgent for politicians and diplomats of various countries to use their political wisdom to seek a reasonable solution.

Wallace has delivered several speeches in the capitals of England, France, Sweden, Norway, and Denmark. Summarizing the main points of his speeches, we can divide them into two points: (1) The contradictions between the U.S. and the Soviet Union are deepening, and President Truman's current policies may cause the world to experience war again; (2) The U.S. aiding Greece and Turkey outside the United Nations framework may cause these countries to break away from the United Nations and take political actions that the U.S. deems satisfactory. In fact, the above two points are still one problem. In other words, in Wallace's mind, he ultimately feels that President Truman's foreign policy is a dangerous anti-Soviet policy, which not only cannot guide the world towards a path of peace and prosperity, but may lead the world to war and destruction. However, examining the U.S. foreign policy since the end of the war, its basic goal is to seek world peace and prosperity. The only path it has taken is to strengthen the authority of the United Nations as much as possible. All things that are beneficial to world peace are welcomed by President Truman, and all things that weaken the authority of the United Nations are things that President Truman does not want to hear. Wallace's criticism of Truman's policies, in our view as a third party, does not have sufficient reason, and we strongly believe that Wallace certainly hopes that the U.S. and the Soviet Union will understand each other and restore the spirit of fighting side by side during the war to jointly create world peace. However, does President Truman himself not hope for the Soviet Union's understanding and cooperation? Secretary of State Marshall went to Moscow at his own expense and tried every means to ensure that the U.S. and the Soviet Union could reach an agreement on the German and Austrian issues, which is an excellent proof. Wallace said in Paris the day before yesterday: "It is the duty of the United States to lead the world towards peace and prosperity." It is remembered that President Truman also said in a speech to the Democratic Party at the beginning of this month: "The United States has an unshirkable responsibility for creating world peace, so it should bear the responsibility of assisting all people whose freedom is in danger." It can be seen that Wallace and President Truman are completely consistent in their goals and have no differences. The only difference is in the methods adopted by the United States to achieve this goal. Obviously, President Truman has not hesitated to adopt a tough policy towards the Soviet Union and believes that "in order to assume the responsibility of creating world peace, the United States must maintain sufficient military strength to make all countries in the world believe that the United States is determined to act in accordance with its responsibilities." Wallace believes that this tough policy only increases the Soviet Union's stubbornness and will not obtain the Soviet Union's understanding. If this continues, a third world war is inevitable. Therefore, should the United States adopt a tough attitude towards the Soviet Union? Or should it adopt a policy of appeasement, compromise with the Soviet Union on everything, and satisfy the Soviet Union's demands everywhere? Which of these two methods is the road to peace? At least at present, no one can predict. Recalling the course of the outbreak of World War II, no one can deny that the weakness and incompetence of democratic administrations and the British Conservative Party cabinet's appeasement policy towards aggressors were the immediate causes of the outbreak of World War II. Therefore, we agree with Wallace's proposition in principle, but we really dare not agree with the methods and paths he wants to take. Fortunately, Wallace also has self-awareness. He also said in Paris: "The goal I am currently working towards will definitely be approved by the American people, but most of them disagree with me on the path to achieving peace."

Standing on the position of a third party, to speak fairly, the evolution of U.S.-Soviet relations to this point is by no means caused by one country unilaterally. If the two countries are to reconcile in the future, it cannot be promoted by one country unilaterally. Therefore, Blum also said that the improvement of the friendship between the two countries depends on the efforts of both sides. Moreover, the crux of U.S.-Soviet relations lies in the difference in ideas and the conflict of interests. How can we eliminate ideological differences? How can we achieve consistency of interests? It is not possible to achieve results simply by talking about understanding with the Soviet Union.

Now, countries around the world, especially the United States, Canada, Turkey, Greece, and other countries, are trying to prevent the penetration of communism. Right and wrong are currently difficult to judge. However, we ultimately believe that prevention is a passive measure, not a fundamental solution. To prevent the spread of communist ideology, the most important thing is to effectively improve the economic system so that the lives of the majority of people can be improved. However, while the United States is actively assisting Greece and Turkey to prevent the invasion of communist forces, it does not seem to be concerned about China, which is openly facing armed rebellions by the Communist Party. Even the 500 million US dollars that have long been designated to be loaned to China are still "allocated but not paid." This cannot but make us question the consistency of American policy. The United States cannot become a prosperous island. Since the United States knows to prevent the activities of the Communist Party within its scope and wants to help Greece and Turkey resist the invasion of communist forces, it is necessary to actively provide assistance to China, which is currently facing the threat of the Communist Party, both for the sake of China and for the sake of the United States itself.

[Reported by this newspaper] London, 24th (Broadcast): Marshall has decided to end the Foreign Ministers Conference tonight and has ordered the first batch of personnel from the U.S. delegation to depart for their country on the afternoon of the 25th. The last Foreign Ministers Conference will hold a final discussion on the Austrian issue and determine the location and date of the next Foreign Ministers Conference, which will be held in New York around the fall of this year. Marshall will return to the United States on his private plane on the morning of the 25th. The train for the French delegation has been prepared one day in advance and will depart tonight if the meeting can be concluded earlier. The British delegation's train will depart 24 hours later than the French delegation's train. Also, news: When the Foreign Ministers Conference concludes tonight, Stalin will host a banquet for the representatives of various countries in the Kremlin to bid farewell.

[United Press, Moscow, 24th] The Four Foreign Ministers Conference has adjourned without results on the 24th. U.S. Secretary of State Marshall issued a statement on the 23rd, severely condemning the Soviet Union, and decided to end the fruitless Foreign Ministers Conference after 45 days of failure. Marshall has announced his intention to leave the Soviet capital and ordered the first batch of the U.S. delegation to leave the Soviet capital on the 25th. Marshall's decision is a public acknowledgment of the complete failure of this Foreign Ministers Conference. The purpose of convening this conference was originally to draft peace treaties with Germany and Austria. The four powers had long abandoned their efforts to reach a peace treaty with Germany. The main obstacles were the Soviet Union's insistence on extracting reparations from Germany's current production, large-scale relocation of German industries, and failure to reach an agreement on the political system of Germany after the completion of the peace treaty. The breakdown of negotiations on the Austrian peace treaty was caused by the Soviet Union's strong support for Yugoslavia's demand for the cession of territory from Austria and the Soviet Union's demands for German property in Austria.

[Associated Press, Moscow, 23rd] The Foreign Ministers Conference today was the longest and most heated, but major issues remain unresolved. The four foreign ministers agreed to try to end the meeting tomorrow. U.S. Secretary of State Marshall accused the Soviet Union of obstructing the Austrian peace treaty and the U.S. proposal for a four-power agreement to disarm Germany. It is said that if the Austrian peace treaty cannot be completed before the opening of the United Nations General Assembly in September, the United States supports transferring the entire issue to the United Nations General Assembly. Regarding the main clauses of the Austrian peace treaty and the four-power agreement, the Western three powers are in agreement, while the Soviet Union alone holds dissenting views. Molotov's rejection of the four-power agreement was to incorporate it into almost all important disputes over the German issue among the four powers in a modified form. I would only like to state one point, that the U.S. government solemnly stated that this action "is tantamount to the Soviet government rejecting the agreement." Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov replied that the United States is trying to force other countries to sign its draft and does not allow for amendments. The intention of the U.S. delegation can be said to be "to replace the Potsdam and Yalta agreements with a new, narrower agreement." British Foreign Secretary Bevin and French Foreign Minister Bidault tried to ease the U.S.-Soviet dispute. Bevin interjected, "If someone initiates the construction of a bridge between the East and the West, it is best not to obstruct it." Marshall reiterated that since the London Foreign Ministers Conference, the Soviet Union has not made any new proposals regarding the Austrian peace treaty. The opinions expressed by the Soviet delegation afterwards not only failed to narrow the disputes among us, but expanded them. The three secret meetings to discuss the Austrian peace treaty in recent days have completely failed. The only constructive action was the Soviet Union's agreement to the British proposal to return all prisoners of war to Germany by the end of next year.

[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 23rd] British Foreign Secretary Bevin met with French Foreign Minister Bidault this morning. According to well-informed sources, the two foreign ministers discussed the date and location of the next four-power foreign ministers conference. Foreign Secretary Bevin supports holding the next Foreign Ministers Conference in Geneva. It is also learned that the French delegation was originally scheduled to depart for home tomorrow night, but it has been postponed until the day after tomorrow.

### Important Issues Regarding Germany Will Be Left for Discussion at the Next Meeting

[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 23rd] The Four Foreign Ministers Conference, at 5:30 PM today, discussed the statistics presented by the subcommittees and reviewed the agenda of the meeting again, and reached the following resolutions: (1) The following issues will be returned to the subcommittees for continued research: (A) all issues regarding the organization of German state governments; (B) all issues regarding the procedures for reparations stipulated in the peace treaty with Germany. (2) The following issues will be returned to the Allied Control Council in Berlin for handling or review: (A) The four powers' agreed-upon guidelines for German disarmament, denazification, political democratization, population exchange, and re-delimitation of borders should be implemented one by one; (B) The points on which the four powers have different opinions on the above five issues should be re-examined; (C) The Foreign Ministers Conference has approved the legislation to liquidate the state of Prussia in March 1947, and the Allied Control Council in Berlin will also be notified. (3) All German economic issues, such as economic unification, industrial standards, and reparations, will not be discussed for the time being and will be left for discussion at the next Foreign Ministers Conference. In addition, the Allied Control Council is requested to provide reports on the above three issues. (4) The issue of German borders will also be left for discussion at the next Foreign Ministers Conference.

### The U.S. House of Representatives Will Also Pass the Aid to Greece and Turkey Act

Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee States

[United Press, Washington, 23rd] Eaton, Chairman of the U.S. House Foreign Affairs Committee, recently expressed confidence that the House of Representatives will follow in the footsteps of the Senate and pass the Aid to Greece and Turkey Act.

[Associated Press, London, 23rd] Undersecretary of State McNeil replied to a question in the House of Commons today that Britain is opposed to the United Nations overseeing U.S. aid to the Greek state, because this move is particularly unfair. In such a situation, to require oversight, but not when other countries provide similar assistance to European countries, is a stimulating discrimination.

### Several U.S. Warships Will Be Transferred to Greece

The Aim Is to Enhance the Strength of the Greek Navy

[Agence France-Presse, Athens, 23rd] It is reported that Greek Navy Minister Venizelos will work with U.S. Naval Attaché to Greece, Admiral Spruance, to study ways to enhance the strength of the Greek Navy. It is rumored that the United States will transfer several minesweepers and two destroyers to Greece.

### Documents of the Balkan Investigation Committee Mysteriously Disappear

[Agence France-Presse, Lake Success, 23rd] The United Nations Secretariat recently announced that all documents of the United Nations Balkan Investigation Committee mysteriously disappeared en route from Greece to Turkey, and their whereabouts are unknown. Details are unclear.

### Impasse in Korean Problem Difficult to Break; Should Convene Four-Power Conference; Reportedly British Government Supports Our Country's Proposal

[Central News Agency, London, 23rd] According to well-informed sources: The British government will support China's proposal, advocating that if the impasse between the US and Soviet authorities in Korea cannot be broken, a Four-Power Conference (US, USSR, UK, China) should be convened to discuss the Korean issue. Simultaneously, the London Times published a letter to the editor from Lim Dung-jik, leader of the Korean delegation in the UK. Mr. Lim suggested that the US and the Soviet Union should simultaneously withdraw their troops without waiting for each other, and then Korea should establish its own government through national elections.

[United Press, Washington, 23rd] Well-informed sources expressed their opinions today, saying that it is meaningless for Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov to accept US Secretary of State Marshall's invitation to resume discussions on the Korean issue, because the Soviet Union's obvious goal is to continue to insist on opposing Koreans who oppose temporary trusteeship from participating in consultations on organizing a provisional government. They said that the point insisted upon by the Soviet Union (which in the United States is considered an unacceptable cancellation of freedom of speech) is something that the United States cannot agree to accept. They continued, unless the Soviet Union is prepared to soften its position, as indicated in Molotov's letter, there is no hope of cooperation when the US-Soviet Joint Commission resumes. Qualified sources suggested that Marshall should issue another statement pointing out that Molotov's reply does not in fact meet the conditions for accepting the US invitation, because it fails to agree to the principle of freedom of speech for Koreans. Most observers believe that Marshall is highly skeptical of obtaining a genuine agreement with the Soviet Union on the Korean issue at present, but is only waging a psychological war to leave room for the US Congress to accept the administration's plan to provide substantial economic assistance to southern Korea.

[Agence France-Presse, London, 23rd] Regarding the negotiations between the United States and the Soviet Union to discuss the fate of Korea, official sources here recently stated that although the United Kingdom participated in the discussion of this issue at the Moscow Three-Power Foreign Ministers Conference in 1945, it has not yet been decided whether to participate in the current US-Soviet negotiations. The only representative of the United Kingdom in Korea is its consul stationed in southern Korea, and the United Kingdom does not have a military delegation stationed in Korea.

### Soviet Ambassador to the US Returns to Post

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 23rd] Soviet Ambassador to the US, Novikov, has returned to his country to report on his work, which has been completed. He will now return to his post, and this afternoon took a plane from Orly Airport to New York.

### US House of Representatives Debates Foreign Relief Bill; Meeting Filled with Anti-Communist Atmosphere

[United Press, Washington, 23rd] The House of Representatives discussed the $350 million foreign relief bill today, without reaching a conclusion, and postponed the discussion until next Monday.

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 23rd] Regarding the US appropriation of $350 million to assist China, Poland, Hungary, Italy, Greece, Austria and other countries after the UNRRA ceased operations, the House of Representatives held a meeting to discuss it. According to observers, today's meeting was filled with an anti-communist atmosphere, similar to the atmosphere in the Senate yesterday when it discussed the aid to Turkey and Greece bill. Although the bill discussed by the House of Representatives today stipulates that the US President can stop providing assistance to any country that refuses to comply with the prescribed conditions, Democratic and Republican members of the House of Representatives continued to speak out against assisting countries dominated or controlled by the Soviet Union. Among them, Chairman Eaton of the House Foreign Affairs Committee declared: Communist ideology is the irreconcilable enemy of the United States. I oppose our assistance to the enemies of the United States. The government authorities are requesting Congress to approve an appropriation of $750 million to assist foreign countries. Congress is facing a very difficult situation. The world must choose between freedom and slavery. The former is the path followed by the United States, and the latter is the path followed by the Soviet Union. The US aid bill for China, Poland, and other countries stipulates the following three guarantees: (1) Relief supplies should be distributed without discrimination based on race, religion, or political views; (2) Beneficiary countries must agree to publicly disclose the quantity of relief supplies provided by the United States as much as possible. Recipient countries should guarantee complete freedom for American radio and newspaper reporters who wish to observe the distribution of relief supplies; (3) Beneficiary countries must not transfer American relief supplies to other countries or use surplus relief supplies to maintain their armies.

The State Department has submitted a list of candidates for relief commissioners.

[United Press, Washington, 23rd] Acting Secretary of State Acheson recently wrote to Chairman Eaton of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, saying that the State Department is carrying out a relief plan and now intends to appoint Allen, the European relief commissioner of the American Red Cross during World War I, to preside over it.

### US Communist Leader Suspected of Conspiracy to Commit Treason

Thomas Requests Indictment

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 23rd] Chairman Thomas, a Democratic member of the House Un-American Activities Committee, today approached President Truman, requesting that the President order Attorney General Clark to indict communist leaders on charges of "conspiracy to commit treason."

### Communist Party Activities in Australia Creating Industrial Disturbances

[Central News Agency, Canberra, 23rd, United Press] Australian Foreign Minister Evatt told the House of Representatives today that the Australian government is unable to prohibit communists from creating industrial disturbances throughout Australia, which is a serious crisis.

### Wallace's Speech to French Parliament; Few Listeners, Mostly Communists

[Reuters, Paris, 23rd] Former US Vice President Wallace delivered a speech to members of the French Senate and National Assembly today, but out of a total of thousands of members, only about a hundred were present, mostly communists. Wallace stated that in order to solve the peace problem, the anti-communist mentality in the United States must be eliminated. Wallace also said that he is not a communist but a progressive conservative. However, when a member asked him if he thought there were also progressive elements within the Soviet Union, Wallace seemed embarrassed. Wallace also said that he supports American capitalism, but feels that capitalism should adapt to the trend of the times.

[United Press, Paris, 24th] Wallace's European tour is coming to an end, and he is scheduled to deliver his most insightful speech on France tonight. This morning, representatives of French political groups such as the Popular Republican Movement, trade unions, and socialist organizations will visit Mr. Wallace at the George V Hotel for talks. French Prime Minister Ramadier is scheduled to meet with Mr. Wallace in the afternoon.

[United Press, Paris, 23rd] Wallace delivered a speech here at the Foreign Policy Association, saying that if the United States continues to pursue its current policies, it may plunge itself into the worst depression in history within a year. If this economic slump can be alleviated by huge army and navy expenditures, it will also force other countries to make similar expenditures in the military sphere. However, if we want to prevent the economic slump from continuing after the war, the United States should, as a creditor nation, use its resources to engage in constructive work around the world. If this can be done, the price paid by Britain and the United States for carrying out peace work through the United Nations will be more economical than increasing military spending.

[United Press, Paris, 23rd] Wallace delivered a speech to the American Veterans Committee here, saying, I believe that what the United States and the Soviet Union are doing today has destroyed the sacred movement for which their young people sacrificed their lives. There is a huge movement in the United States now, and its impact may easily lead to a third world war. Regarding the plan to aid Greece and Turkey, if the United States goes beyond the United Nations and provides aid, and it is not constructive, these countries will deviate from the United Nations and tend toward the political actions that the United States considers desirable. We still remember when Truman introduced Churchill in Fulton, Missouri last year, calling him a "citizen of the other world." It should be known that the title of "world citizen" cannot be easily bestowed on people, but must be obtained through actions. Both the United States and the Soviet Union are willing to move towards peace in friendly relations. If the US government can act properly, I will also praise it. If I think a Soviet action is wrong, I will also criticize it. When hatred harms peace, I will never participate in any movement to isolate the Soviet Union or form an anti-Soviet camp, resulting in deeper hatred. However, I will do everything I can to promote understanding between the two major countries.

### Two Soviet Soldiers in Germany Injured by British Military Police

[Reuters, Berlin, 23rd] A newspaper in the Soviet sector of Berlin reported that the Soviet commander in Berlin, General Kotikov, yesterday informed the Allied High Command that two Soviet soldiers had been beaten severely by British military police, and one of the soldiers had lost an eye as a result. General Kotikov demanded an immediate investigation into the matter.

[Reuters, Berlin, 23rd] After the commander of the Soviet forces in Berlin, General Kotikov, protested to the Allied High Command about the serious injury of two Soviet soldiers beaten by British military police, the British authorities here officially responded, refuting the facts as stated by the Soviet side, stating that the two Soviet soldiers were arrested in connection with a shooting incident involving the coercion of two German women in the Spandau district of Berlin (i.e., the place where the incident occurred as claimed by the Soviet side). When the British military police first went to arrest them, the two soldiers fled into the Soviet military zone. Unexpectedly, the two later re-entered the Spandau district and again coerced the two German women. A British military police patrol stopped them, but the Soviet soldiers refused to listen and resisted arrest with force, and a conflict ensued. Both Soviet soldiers were injured as a result. One suffered five wounds. The head, eyes, and body were cut. The other also had wounds on his head and abrasions on his body. After the two were captured, they were sent to a British military hospital, but they refused treatment, and were eventually taken away by the Soviet military. At the time of the incident, the two Soviet soldiers were obviously drunk. After they were arrested, several ammunition magazines and bullets were found at the scene of the incident, the same as those found on them.

### After Britain Withdraws from India

— Translated by Our Newspaper Editorial Office

After Britain decides to withdraw from India in June 1948, India's long struggle for freedom and independence will come to an end. From then on, India will break away from Britain's shackles, although it is still uncertain whether it has the ability to govern itself. This step by Britain is due in part to Britain's weakness and incompetence, and in part to the increasing expansion of Indian national power.

Britain cannot decide to whom its authority will be transferred. The British Labour government holds an optimistic view, believing that the needs of the times will enable India to prepare to shoulder its responsibilities. Most of the rest believe that an independent India will eventually be established on the basis of unity. It is very likely that India's future will become a problem for the United Nations. At the same time, it is also very likely that chaos and civil war will occur among the 400 million people.

In India, there is an antagonistic relationship between Hindus and Muslims. This is by no means just a dispute between 250 million Hindus and 92 million Muslims, but a fierce social struggle involving religion, people, and regime. The Indian National Congress, led by Gandhi and Nehru, harbors the ambition of majority party rule, while the Muslim League, led by Jinnah, harbors the determination to separate the Muslim country. The two factions are competing fiercely.

The optimistic view of the British Labour Party is as follows: Since the sincerity of Britain's withdrawal from India has been determined beyond doubt, both Hindus and Muslims will inevitably begin to exert their inherent instincts for self-defense. With no external forces interfering and meeting each other directly, they will naturally feel that they have the necessity to cooperate. Although the method of resolution is unpredictable, everyone has a psychological feeling that a bad government of Indians is better than a good government of British.

It is a very obvious fact that the British have neither the money nor the military power to support India. The Labour Party feels that the sooner Britain grants India political independence, the more opportunities Britain will have to protect its commercial interests in India.

The comments of the London Times are sufficient to represent another view of the British. This faction also admits that Britain is too weak to implement its wishes in India. They do not believe that the withdrawal plan is an effective answer to India's current crisis. The cause of this crisis is first, because the Hindu and Muslim sides cannot cooperate in the interim government, and second, because the two sides are arguing over the method of drafting the future constitution. These critics suggest that Britain may be forced to choose a path between the Indian National Congress and the Muslim League in India before 1948. They fear that a Hindu-Muslim conflagration could result in the collapse of the entire Indian central government.

Britain has several unfinished matters in India that need to be decided. Whether Britain will transfer its authority to the entire India, or to eleven provinces, or, according to the official statement, "transfer its authority in other most reasonable and beneficial ways to the people of India," remains an unresolved question. At the same time, the liquidation of Britain's treaty relations with the Indian monarchs is still pending.

The National Congress Party, composed mostly of Hindus, is obviously the most powerful political party in India, and the party has also reached a consensus with the militant Sikhs. Regardless of the traditional fighting nature of Muslims, Hindus are bound to have the upper hand in the event of a Hindu-Muslim conflagration.

Since Wavell retired, Mountbatten has succeeded him as Governor-General of India. When Nehru visited the Allied headquarters in Singapore after the end of World War II, Mountbatten, with foresight, had already become friends with Nehru, which fully demonstrated his statesmanship. Rather than saying that Mountbatten will exercise the privileges of the British King's representative in his capacity as the Governor of India, it is better to say that he will deal with the Indian issue as the chairman of a committee.

### Churchill Criticizes Government, Accuses of Improper Palestine Policy

[Reuters, Epping, Essex, 23rd] Former British Prime Minister Churchill spoke in his constituency today, saying that Britain is fighting endlessly in Palestine, trying to give the land to the Arabs. America and the Soviet Union's estimation and respect for our country have plummeted. The government is making light of important matters and has clearly ruined the vast Indian Empire. The government's policy in Palestine is completely different from that in India. The government is fighting there at all costs, and the troops are four times those stationed in India. Our country is fighting the Jews in Palestine to make the land belong to the Arabs, and is sparing no effort to do so, but the mismanagement in India has been despised by the whole world. When I was in the United States, I used my position to facilitate the Labour government's borrowing from the United States. Unexpectedly, after the success, they were deliberately wasted, and I cannot help but feel surprised and disappointed. The consumption of loans on tobacco and films accounts for the largest part. I don't know how we can overcome our country's difficulties after the loans are exhausted, unless there is another war. The intelligence and determination shown by our country will not be able to overcome it. Churchill then criticized the government's shortening of the term of military service from eighteen months to twelve months. Churchill finally stated that he has no political ambitions. The reason why he has not withdrawn from government activities is to fulfill his duty to assist the country.

### Japanese House of Representatives Re-election Voting Held Today; New Government May Still Be Led by Yoshida

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 24th Special Dispatch] Japanese voters will vote tomorrow to elect 466 members of the House of Representatives, which is the second election in the past week. According to the Asahi Shimbun, a total of 1,572 candidates are participating in this important election. The largest number is the Democratic Party, with 331, followed by the Liberal Party with 323, the Social Democratic Party with 282, independent candidates with 257, and the Communist Party with 120. The press predicts that voters will still adopt a moderate attitude when electing members of parliament.

[United Press, Tokyo, 24th] It is expected here that the conservatives will also win an absolute majority in the election of members of the House of Representatives, so the left-wing forces will be very weak in the new cabinet that succeeds the Yoshida cabinet after the 30th. The new government is very likely to be led by Prime Minister Yoshida again, and most of the current cabinet members will also be re-elected.

### Fast Train Derailment at Same Spot at West Lane; Fortunately, Brakes Applied in Time, Passengers and Goods Safe; Traffic on Nanjing-Shanghai Line Interrupted Again for Three Hours

[Reported by Our Newspaper] The Jinling Express train on the Nanjing-Shanghai Line derailed and overturned at the West Lane station between Lujiabang and Kunshan at 2:30 PM the day before yesterday. After repairs, traffic was restored that evening. Unexpectedly, at 9:00 AM yesterday, the No. 6 First, Second, and Third Class Express train of sixteen cars, traveling from Shanghai to Beijing, at 10:06 AM, when passing through the West Lane station's west branch track where the Jinling train overturned the day before, due to the newly paved roadbed being unstable, the second axle of the eleventh car, TP892, which was a third-class carriage, derailed again. The driver noticed it and immediately applied the brakes. Fortunately, the train speed had already been reduced at that time, and passengers and goods were safe. Subsequently, the railway bureau sent a rescue vehicle to the site for repairs, and the entire line was repaired at 1:10 PM, and traffic was restored at 1:30 PM. The No. 78 Express train, which was scheduled to depart at 12:20 PM, was suspended for one day. Traffic on the entire line was interrupted for more than three hours.

After the Jinling Express train derailed and overturned at West Lane station the day before yesterday afternoon, Minister Yu of the Ministry of Communications, upon hearing the news, immediately dispatched Director Fu Jun of the Railway Administration Department and Chief Wang Bi of the Machinery Department to Shanghai that night to thoroughly investigate the cause of the derailment. At 8:00 AM yesterday, they, accompanied by railway bureau officials Guan Duo and Wu Yukun, went to the accident site for inspection. Coincidentally, Deputy Director Hou Huohua of the bureau returned from Suzhou after visiting the injured passengers and met them at West Lane station. Deputy Director Hou and others had witnessed the derailment of the No. 6 train yesterday. When the reporter visited Mr. Hou yesterday afternoon, he still could not give a definite answer to the cause of the derailment of the Jinling Express train the day before, saying only that it may be due to the steel rails and sleepers being too old and rotten to withstand the heavy load of American-style passenger cars. A consultation and discussion will be held after the relevant departments investigate. Regarding the injured passengers the day before, the seriously injured person, Chen Panming, is currently living in Suzhou Public Hospital. He had a lot of bleeding from the head, but has been out of danger after emergency treatment. He had his appendix removed in Shanghai not long ago, and the doctor ordered him to rest for a few days before he can be discharged safely. The seriously injured train attendant Tao Zengrong is being treated in Qishuyan Railway Hospital. The remaining ten or so slightly injured people were bandaged and discharged, and sent back to their destinations separately.

In addition, the railway bureau originally scheduled to hold a meeting on traffic accidents yesterday afternoon, but due to another derailment incident yesterday, all the responsible personnel went to the accident site for investigation and repairs, so the meeting was postponed.

### Voices Under Heavy Price Pressure; Newspaper and Other Workers Request Unfreezing of Index

[Reported by Our Newspaper] In recent days, price fluctuations have been drastic, and salaried workers have been severely threatened. In the city, workers had their cost-of-living index frozen by government order, and although there is a subsidy for the difference each month, the amount is very small. Now prices have skyrocketed several times, making it difficult to make ends meet, and life is gradually becoming difficult to maintain. They are now brewing to demand that the government unfreeze the cost-of-living index. This undercurrent is gradually expanding. The day before yesterday, workers in various yarn factories under the Fourth District Cotton Spinning Union submitted a document to the General Trade Union requesting the unfreezing of the index. Yesterday, the Zhonghua Book Company also submitted a document to the General Trade Union, and the Newspaper Industry Workers' Union also submitted a document to the Social Affairs Bureau requesting that it be forwarded to the central government to unfreeze the index, stating: "Since the Supreme National Defense Council promulgated the economic emergency measures, stipulating that the wages of workers should be based on the cost-of-living index for January of this year as the highest index, the cost-of-living index of workers has been frozen in accordance with this method, so that wages do not stimulate prices, and prices can be stabilized, in order to save the crisis of industry and commerce. Later, there was also the provision for issuing subsidies for the difference, which was well-intentioned and sufficient to show that the authorities were concerned about the lives of workers. However, in recent days, the price surge has intensified, exceeding several times. Therefore, the reason for the high prices is undoubtedly not stimulated by wages, and as a result, the lives of workers are increasingly plunged into hardship. The association had previously requested that the central government restore the wage payment method based on the cost-of-living index for workers, and now, as a last resort, we sincerely ask you to consider the facts and submit them to the central government to restore the wage payment method based on the cost-of-living index for workers, in order to care for the lives of workers and maintain social order."

### Problems Arise in Wage Calculation Method for Employees of Linchang Textile Factory

The wage calculation method for employees of the British-owned Linchang Textile Factory is based on an index compiled by the factory itself, using rice prices as the basis. Therefore, the government's order to freeze the cost-of-living index and subsidize the difference has nothing to do with the factory. Recently, employees, seeing that the wages they received in January and February could originally buy 3 dan of rice, but in March they could only buy 1.5 dan, and the price of rice has skyrocketed in recent days, and the income will depreciate. They submitted a document to the Social Affairs Bureau requesting (1) The employer increase the rice by two sheng. (2) The rice index should be based on 10 yuan per dan as the standard base, and the wages for February, March and April must be reissued to the workers. (3) Otherwise, the cost-of-living index stipulated by the government will be used for calculation, and the difference will be reissued, the basic salary will be adjusted, and meals and accommodation will be provided.

[Another Dispatch] Employees of the foreign-owned Yizhong Tobacco Company submitted a document to the Social Affairs Bureau requesting that wages be paid as usual for weekly holidays.

### Dismantling of the Iron Wire Enclosure Organization Committee in Zhabei

[Report from our newspaper] The more than one thousand mu of land in the Zhabei district, enclosed by iron wire by the enemy and puppet regimes, is currently used by the Joint Operations Headquarters Transportation Equipment Storage and Transportation Department, the Executive Yuan Storage and Transportation Bureau, and the Joint Logistics Headquarters First Supply Department, among other agencies. The Landowners' Association of the area has repeatedly requested the Municipal Government to ask these agencies to relocate. Yesterday morning at 9:00 AM, representatives of the landowners met with Director Zhu of the Municipal Land Administration Bureau to report the situation. Director Zhu expressed his willingness to assist and promised to submit the matter to the Municipal Government Council for thorough resolution.

[Another report] Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, Mayor Wu, regarding the iron wire enclosure in Zhabei, summoned Zhabei District Chief Wang Zhiping and Yang Zemin, Deputy Director of the Transportation Equipment Storage and Transportation Department of the Joint Logistics Headquarters. He gave detailed instructions on the method of dismantling the iron wire enclosures. It was decided that the Bureau of Public Works, the Land Administration Bureau, the District Office, the Police Precinct, and the Transportation Equipment Storage and Transportation Department, among other agencies, would form an Iron Wire Enclosure Committee to carry out the dismantling work. He also stated that squatters and illegal personnel would be thoroughly investigated to uphold the law and protect the legitimate rights and interests of the landowners.

Yesterday was the anniversary of the martyrdom of General Xie Jinyuan. A memorial ceremony was held in front of his tomb at the Former Lone Army Barracks. The photo shows Police Chief Wang Zhaohu of the Second Route Police Station officiating at the ceremony. (Photo by our newspaper)

### Collision of Two Ships on the Huangpu River - "Hai Han" Suffers Damage, Suspends Voyage to Yingkou, "Yong Xing" Has Steel Plates on the Starboard Hull Dented

[Report from our newspaper] The China Merchants Bureau's "Hai Han" transport ship, loaded with over 1,400 tons of commercial cargo, departed from the Jinliyuan Wharf at 2:00 PM yesterday, headed for Yingkou. When passing the Lujiazui section of the Huangpu River outside the Waibaidu Bridge, it encountered the "Yong Xing" ship of the Zhongxing Company returning to Shanghai from Qingdao. At the time, the tide was rising. The "Yong Xing" ship was coming from the east and, upon reaching the Lujiazui section, should have turned south to go with the current and proceed quickly. Because foreign ships were moored at buoys number one and two in that area, the stern of the "Yong Xing" ship swerved to avoid the foreign ships, giving way sharply to the right. Unexpectedly, the "Hai Han" ship was approaching the same area, intending to turn east from the south. Consequently, the two ships collided head-on without being able to avoid each other. Fortunately, the "Hai Han" ship was moving slowly, and its bow only grazed the main part of the "Yong Xing" ship's starboard side. Several steel plates below the deck on the "Yong Xing" ship, at the waterline, were dented. The bow of the "Hai Han" ship was damaged. The "Yong Xing" ship was still able to sail to the Zhongxing Wharf and dock. The "Hai Han" ship was unable to sail and immediately reported to the general office, which sent two small tugboats to tow it back to the Jinliyuan Wharf. Both ships require repairs. According to the Bureau, if the "Hai Han" ship is unable to sail, the cargo destined for Yingkou will be transferred to the "Hai Hu" ship for transportation. As for the issue of responsibility for the collision, the two authorities are awaiting formal reports from the captains of both ships before conducting an investigation and inviting experts for discussion.

### One-Year Sentence in "Foreign Tiger" Case Deemed Inappropriate by Original Informant

The case of "Foreign Tiger," the Dutchman Miesberg, illegally engaging in foreign exchange operations, was previously judged by the District Court to a one-year prison sentence, with a confiscation of $40,000 in US currency and $20,000 in Hong Kong currency.

He recently submitted four points of opinion, requesting the Songhu Garrison Command to forward a letter to the District Prosecutor's Office to file an appeal within the statutory time limit. Commander Xuan stated that since the case has been tried by the court, if the original judgment is indeed inappropriate, the prosecutor should file an appeal in the capacity of a party concerned according to law. This headquarters, bound by legal procedures, is not in a position to make such a request on their behalf, and approved the matter to be handled directly by the original informant with the District Prosecutor's Office.

### Three-Day War Criminal Indicted - Innocent People Subjected to Extreme Humiliation and Torture, Led Troops to Loot and Burn Houses

[Report from our newspaper] Japanese war criminal Wakabayashi Bunichi, 35 years old, from Ishikawa Prefecture, Japan, formerly the Intelligence Chief of the Tono Headquarters stationed in Shuyang. Yoshikawa Genichi, 29 years old, from Osaka City, Japan, formerly the Commander of the Machine Gun Company of the Tono Headquarters. On August 1, 1943, two civilians, Zhang Lejun and Wang Yinde, fled from the Communist-controlled area to Shuyang County. Enemy spy Li Yanlu learned of this and reported it to Wakabayashi Bunichi. He then led five enemy soldiers and a translator, Jin Chuan, to arrest and detain Zhang and Wang. They were interrogated day and night using torture and subjected to extreme humiliation. Yoshikawa Genichi was particularly violent during the interrogation. After the victory, the victims reported the matter to the Ninety-eighth Army Headquarters. The Lianyungang Transportation Command detained them and handed them over to the Military Tribunal of the First Pacification Zone. After investigation, the facts were confirmed, and they were indicted yesterday.

Another Japanese war criminal, Kuwata Tamio, has also been indicted.

### Examination Methods for the Savings and Remittance Bureau are Being Drafted

[Report from our newspaper] The Postal Savings and Remittances Bureau is drafting measures to restore the personnel examination system for savings and remittance, and is submitting them to the Ministry of Transportation for approval and implementation. According to the person in charge of the Bureau, who spoke to reporters yesterday, the Bureau's personnel have always been selected through examinations. Since 1943, when the Bureau was ordered to handle national salvation savings business, new personnel were appointed without examination. After the restoration, this practice continued, and some new personnel were also appointed without examination. These personnel were employed under the titles of researchers, assistant secretaries, and compilers, totaling more than 1,200 people. This not only contradicts the Postal Savings and Remittances Bureau's traditional examination system, but also caused considerable criticism from the Bureau's old colleagues. Furthermore, given the Bureau's current sluggish business, the affiliated institutions and personnel must be streamlined and reduced in order to save expenses. Regarding the method of reducing personnel, among the more than 1,200 current employees who have not been examined, examinations for Grade A and B postal workers and postal assistants will be conducted based on their qualifications. Those who are not admitted will be given severance pay and return travel expenses. This method will be implemented after approval by the Ministry of Transportation, and the examination will be held on a scheduled date.

### Sun Tianchangzhi, Suspected War Criminal, Questioned and Investigated by Military Tribunal

[Report from our newspaper] The case of Korean Sun Tianchangzhi, suspected of being a war criminal, was heard for the first time by Judge Qu Zezeng of the Military Tribunal of the First Pacification Zone yesterday. The defendant, dressed in a neat suit, appeared in court with his defense lawyers Jiang Yiping and Yang Linzhi. The accusers, Zhou Hanpu, Han Kaiyuan, and Zhou Qingrong, also appeared in court. Judge Qu questioned them separately based on the points in the indictment, the defendant's previous statements recorded in the High Court, and the various documents submitted by the accusers. Sun Tianchangzhi's testimony was generally the same as his previous statements in the High Court. Since yesterday was only for investigation, the case will be heard again by a collegiate panel for debate before a verdict can be reached. The main points of the Military Tribunal's indictment in this case are recorded as follows: "The defendant, Sun Tianchangzhi, with a background in mechanical technology, founded the Jingmi Arts and Crafts Company in Shanghai, manufacturing industrial machines such as lathes and milling machines, employing 77 male and female workers. After the enemy army occupied Shanghai, he was designated as a Class B military-designated factory by the enemy army headquarters in October 1944, ordering him to manufacture small milling machines and pumps. After the victory, the property was confiscated by the Suzhou-Zhejiang-Anhui Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau and allocated to the state. After the Japanese surrendered, the defendant remained at the original site, but the factory ceased operations. On May 28, 1946, the Songhu Garrison Command was ordered to relocate Korean residents of the Hardoon Building and found eight telescopes and six small cameras in the defendant's showroom, suspected of military use, and summoned the defendant for interrogation. After investigation, the Command considered the case to be an ordinary criminal matter and transferred it to the Shanghai Local Prosecutor's Office for investigation on July 11 of the same year. The defendant was released on bail after submitting a written guarantee of 10 million yuan. In October 1945, Zhou Hanpu, Han Kaiyuan, and Zhou Qingrong reported to the Military Intelligence Bureau that the defendant had offered to repair aircraft to the enemy at the Jinliu Airport and had used the British-owned Moulotrie Music Store's main factory to collect coins for the enemy to manufacture ammunition. The materials at the warehouse at 1350 Seymour Road and the residence at 929 Route Petain were sealed off once, and the Japanese orders among them were confiscated, while the rest were returned. The accusers were dissatisfied and secretly reported to the Investigation Team again, which transferred the case to the High Court for trial. The High Court ruled that the charge of traitor was not established and transferred the case to this court. The defendant had an original factory worker's card during the trial in the Commercial Court, proving that the defendant did have collaborationist acts. Although the defendant claimed that the worker was fired and held a grudge, he admitted to offering 400,000 yuan to the enemy to purchase aircraft. In summary, the defendant does have suspicions of collaborating with the enemy and should be prosecuted in accordance with the War Criminals Trial Regulations."

### Father and Son Accused of Drug Trafficking in the Neighborhood, Defendants Still Vehemently Deny

[Report from our newspaper] Wang Xianzong and his son Wang Yuwei were accused of being suspected traitors and trafficking drugs. The High Court held another hearing yesterday. It is alleged that Wang Xianzong owns 12 houses in Lujiabang, Nanshi. After the Japanese enemy occupied the area, in order to preserve his property, he rented part of it to Li Jinfa, who served as a puppet soldier, colluded with the Japanese Kawada and Kishida, and ordered his son Wang Yuwei to receive training at the puppet navy training center. After graduating in January 1940, he served as a squad leader in the center, and later served as a squad leader on the puppet Haixing warship. At that time, the enemy was plotting to drug our country, and Wang Xianzong and his son Wang Yuwei were protected and indulged, selling heroin and opium, which the son smuggled from Tianjin and Hankou, and then his father sold at home for huge profits.

[Report from our newspaper] The Lao Zha Police Precinct recently learned that the Sanhua Pharmacy at No. 511 Wusong Road was secretly selling morphine injections. Yesterday morning at approximately 11:00 AM, Chief Jiang ordered staff member Xue Yunbai to disguise himself as a customer and police officer Ge Zonghao to disguise himself as a rickshaw puller. They went to the pharmacy and pretended to buy morphine injections. Partners Yang Zhifa and Gu Jinrong then took out two boxes of morphine injections, each box containing ten injections, totaling 500,000 yuan in legal tender. Xue Yunbai and others then arrested them and took them to the precinct for interrogation. According to their confession, the morphine injections were obtained from Zhang Xu Guiying (31 years old, a female worker in a pharmacy), a young woman from Wujin residing at No. 12, Lane 112 on the same road.

### Four Defendants in Traitor Case on Trial - A Female Worker, Six Months Pregnant, Accused of Abusing Workers

[Report from our newspaper] The case of Chen Zixing, Chen Zhixiang, Shen Yemu, and Xia Laowu, among others, on suspicion of being traitors, was heard for the first time in the High Court yesterday afternoon. The first defendant, Chen Zixing, was accused of serving as the manager of the Hengyuanxing Cotton Mill and the Hengda Xinji Cotton Mill during the enemy and puppet periods, providing cotton yarn to the enemy. Yesterday, Chen admitted in court to serving as the manager of the above cotton mills, but claimed: "Hengyuanxing was a partnership operated by General Manager He. Hengda Xinji was leased to Zhang Boqin in May 1940 and renamed Hengda Heji. It was not taken back until July 1944. Zhang is now missing, but the intermediary lawyer Zhu Wende can be summoned to testify." He denied the rest of the charges of aiding the enemy. The second defendant, Chen Zhixiang, did not appear. The third defendant, Shen Yemu, died of illness on March 15. His wife Shen Jiangshi and son Shen Naichang appeared in court to describe the circumstances of his death and stated that "the Yulin Road Police Precinct has been notified to verify the death." The fourth defendant, Xia Laowu, is a woman who is currently pregnant, her belly swollen. She was accused of serving as the chief foreman of the Hengda Xinji Cotton Mill, relying on the power of the enemy and puppet regime to abuse workers. The defendant argued that she had been working in the cotton mill since she was sixteen years old and is now forty-two years old. She worked as a female worker in the fine yarn room and was not a foreman, presenting her then-cotton mill pass as proof. After a lengthy hearing, the court ruled that the case required further investigation and adjourned the hearing, with the defendants remaining on their original bail.

The remaining defendants only violated ordinary criminal law, but since the crime was committed before the promulgation of the amnesty decree, they were all acquitted in accordance with the provisions of Item A of the amnesty decree.

### Reader Consultation

Legal Interpretation

(1) Continued Residence

Wang Lu Miao Ying rented a floor of a house from a friend, Mr. Yi (Mr. Yi was the second landlord of the house), in the spring of the 35th year of the Republic. At that time, a lease contract was signed, with each party holding a copy. The contract stated, "This lease is for a term of one year, and after the term expires, it cannot be continued. The house must be immediately vacated and returned to Mr. Yi..." The lease on the house expired this spring. Can I continue to reside there and not vacate according to the lease?

[Answer from Lawyer Duanmu Kai] Since the right to renew the lease was waived in advance when the contract was signed, it is difficult to argue for continued leasing.

(2) Returning to One's Former Residence

Ma De asked: I have a house that my late father rented from the main landlord ten years ago. After my father passed away, the whole family moved back to our hometown to live, and the house was sublet (without a contract) to various subtenants. Recently, I need to move back to live there, but the subtenants insist on not moving out. I don't know if I can ask them to move out within a specified period. If they fail to move out after the deadline, can I file a lawsuit?

[Answer from Lawyer Duanmu Kai] According to Article 450, Paragraph 2 of the Civil Code, for leases with no fixed term, the parties may terminate the contract at any time. However, according to the provisions of Article 100 of the Land Law, the house cannot be recovered unless one of the conditions in each clause is met. If there is currently a need to recover the house for one's own use and you can provide concrete proof of recovery for personal use, you can sue the court to order the relocation and recovery of the house.

[Report from our Newspaper] Shantou played Columbus last night for the Mayor's Cup basketball finals spot. As a result, Columbus defeated Shantou 37-29 and awaits the championship game against Hualian. The women's Snowflake vs. Youth League match for the finals spot ended in another 39-39 draw and will be played for the third time. Last night's tension was no less than the first time.

Columbus defends well and attacks well, and is good at zone defense. Shantou is quite difficult to get close to the basket and mostly relies on long shots to score. Columbus's Xu Caineng is outstanding, coupled with the offensive of Big John Brochi, they complement each other. Oberlin and Tringhua control the basket, making Shantou feel very difficult. Shantou's performance last night was far inferior to the game against Hualian. Lin Weisong was the most popular with the audience. He was better in the second half than in the first half. The rest of the team seemed to be abnormal.

The Youth League threatened Snowflake, and as a result, it ended in another draw. However, the Youth League team has more hope for the future and is younger, all in their golden age. Last night, the Youth League forward did his best.

There were three other games: (1) Exhibition game, Lun Jius defeated Center 74-6. (2) Youth Team 2 defeated Holy Youth, 28-13. Green Jay defeated Culture, 66-6.

### Mayor Wu Cares About the Food Supply of the City: White Rice Price Limited to 170,000; Rice Distribution to Leave Warehouse at Least 9,000 Bags Daily

[Report from Our Newspaper] The recent fluctuations in the rice market have caused great concern among the authorities. Mayor Wu, upon returning to Shanghai from Hangzhou on the evening of the 23rd, summoned rice merchant representatives Zhenhua, Cha Bao San, Xu Songren, Cai Shengming, Hu Wenan, Hu Chenggang, and others at 9:00 AM yesterday morning for discussions, inquiring in detail about the situation in the rice market. The representatives stated that the price of white rice at the source has already reached 172,000 yuan, and adding shipping costs, selling it in Shanghai at 180,000 yuan would still not yield any profit. Moreover, the rice released by the Social Affairs Bureau has been slow to be delivered. Mayor Wu stated that the city has a sufficient stock of rice to maintain supply even if no more rice comes from the producing areas. The city government has decided to release 9,000 bags of rice daily, and the amount may be increased if necessary. It is true that the distribution of rice has been slow in the past, but starting from the 25th (today), it is stipulated that at least 9,000 bags will be released from the warehouse daily to meet the needs. It is strictly ordered that the trading price of white rice in the market shall not exceed 160,000 yuan, and the retail price shall not exceed 170,000 yuan. Violations will be severely punished. After meeting with the rice merchant representatives, a notice was posted in the North and South markets to convey the Mayor's intentions, and the rising trend has been somewhat eased.

Yesterday, the North and South markets received a total of 1,660 piculs and 5 dou of goods. Transactions in white rice disappeared, while Bai Yuan rice rose sharply to 205,000 yuan, and Yin Yuan rice reached 194,000 yuan. The Social Affairs Bureau continued to release 9,000 bags of white rice, Saigon No. 2, and Red Tip rice.

Yesterday, bean oil from our factory returned to slightly under 20,000 yuan, while Qingdao Jeep barrel raw oil was 495,000 yuan, raw oil was 450,000 yuan, small cart sesame oil was 510,000 yuan, and Doushu bean rose sharply by 25,000 yuan to 165,000 yuan per dan. Foreign vermicelli was 103,000 yuan, local vermicelli was 75,000 yuan, and bran was 54,000 yuan.

The sales of soybean cakes remained stable, but due to the high cost of raw materials, they rose by another thousand yuan or so. Soybeans experienced a sudden surge, rising endlessly, jumping by more than 10,000 yuan. Mung beans maintained their firmness, and red beans from South China were being heavily absorbed, continuing to see a sharp increase of 10,000 yuan. Red sorghum was eagerly sought after by distilleries, increasing sharply by 7,000 to 8,000 yuan. Broad beans were actively traded and rose sharply by 10,000 yuan. Raw peanuts were in greater demand than supply, unusually popular. Foreign companies' high-quality goods soared by 20,000 to 30,000 yuan, and bulk goods rose dramatically by 20,000 yuan, reaching new highs. Corn was extremely stable, and sesame seeds were nominally firm but actually strongly demanded.

### Foreign Stocks Continue to Rise

### Mayor Wu Hosted the Press Yesterday to Explain Measures to Suppress Prices; Vowing the Utmost Determination to Eradicate the Black Market for Gold and Yarn

Mayor Wu hosted the press at 5:00 PM yesterday to report on measures to deal with suppressing prices and the government's determination.

(1) Rice: The Mayor stated that he had absolute confidence in suppressing the price to below 170,000 yuan, and said that the price of rice in the producing areas rose on April 1st, and Shanghai followed suit on April 6th. At that time, there was concern that there would be a reverse flow of rice, so the city government did not immediately release rice. By last Wednesday, the price in the producing areas had been suppressed, so the government released 11,000 piculs every day. This amount is sufficient for the needs of the entire city and even exceeds the needs by 1,000 piculs. At that time, rice merchants also agreed that the retail price would not exceed 170,000 yuan. On Monday of this week, while he was in Hangzhou, he received a telegram stating that the price had fallen to 165,000 yuan. Unexpectedly, on Tuesday, a black market emerged, and the producing areas and Shanghai colluded to raise prices. Upon receiving this information, he rushed back the night before and decided with the Economic Inspection Office this morning that, starting from yesterday afternoon, the retail price should not exceed 170,000 yuan per dan, and market transactions should not exceed 160,000 yuan. It is believed that in the short term, rice merchants will adopt a wait-and-see attitude, but the city government can release 11,000 piculs every day to meet the needs of the entire city, and panic should not occur. However, two points must be noted: (A) Due to the high price in the producing areas, there is concern about a reverse flow, and the military and police have been ordered to strictly prevent this. (B) It is difficult to guarantee that small black markets will not occur. On this point, it is hoped that people's organizations and the press will act as the government's eyes and ears. If anything is discovered, report it immediately for strict investigation. The Mayor also hoped that the price of rice in Wuxi could be suppressed to the limited price of 130,000 yuan, so that the retail price in Shanghai could return to around 155,000 yuan.

(2) Yarn: According to the Mayor's estimate, there are 20,000 bales of yarn hoarded in the city. It has been decided in consultation with the Economic Inspection Group and the Yarn Industry Association that all cotton yarn purchased within the last month and a half, after March 15th, must leave the warehouse before the end of this month, be applied for shipment for export, or be sold to spinning mills. The Economic Inspection Group has been ordered to strictly investigate hoarding of yarn in the city starting today. The counterparties to whom they are sold must also register with the government. If they are still not processed by the end of the month, the government will recover them at the original purchase price, forcing hoarders and speculators to release their goods, and the price of yarn will naturally fall. The Central Bank is actively seeking sources of cotton, which is expected to be resolved.

(3) Black Market for Gold and US Dollars: The official price of gold is 4.8 million, which is said to be quite different from the old black market price. However, repeated strict investigations by the Economic Inspection Group and military and police agencies have failed to locate this black market trading place. Now, the Mayor has ordered military and police personnel to disguise themselves as various characters and also instructed appropriate businessmen to try their best to find various routes to purchase black market gold and US dollars. If anything is discovered, arrests will be made immediately and severely punished in accordance with emergency economic measures. The government has the utmost determination and will definitely eradicate the black market.

### Diesel Prices Rise Sharply

Rong Oil's sales were sluggish last month, as factories' quotas were sufficient, and prices once fell to near the allocated price, only 50,000 to 100,000 yuan higher. Now, due to some kind of stimulation, merchants are asking for 1.1 million yuan per ton.

### Bituminous Coal Market Turns Weak

Bituminous coal importers are taking a wait-and-see attitude, and sales are becoming sluggish. However, sellers are still unwilling to lower their prices. Anthracite coal sales are active, and the trend is extremely brisk.

### Speculation Abounds Regarding Delivery Prospects; Chinese Stocks Fluctuate Erratically

Chinese stocks engaged in intense battles between bulls and bears yesterday. Sellers repeatedly exerted pressure amid rumors of unfavorable delivery prospects. However, due to the repeated tightening of foreign exchange, buyers stubbornly resisted, resulting in rapid rises and falls, and dangerous turbulence. Many small investors suffered heavy losses, resulting in a sharp decrease in transaction volume and erratic fluctuations. However, Delivery Xinguang and Innerwear both closed at the limit up.

At the opening, all stocks opened higher except for Xinhua, which fell slightly. Innerwear even opened at the limit up, and Delivery Xinguang stopped trading immediately upon opening. Upon opening, Delivery Yongsheng saw a lot of back and forth between buyers and sellers, with 79, 171, 154, 133, 89, 199, and 84 buying, and 145 aggressively buying spot Yongsheng, pushing Delivery Yongsheng up to 4,770 yuan. 137, 4, 97, 178, 179, 177, and 171 sold, retreating to 4,520 yuan. 117, 215, 133, 85, 4, 68, 199, 142, 62, 68, 145, 76, and 35 all bought, rising to 4,830 yuan. 231, 22, 80, 85, 97, 171, 207, and 4 sold to within 4,700 yuan. At this time, due to reports of a contraction in the Hong Kong exchange rate and a surge in gold and US dollars, 231, 142, 224, 105, and 31 bought, and Delivery Yongsheng rose to 4,840 yuan. 69, 91, 42, 4, 235, 223, 153, 154, 28, 197, 97, 36, 177, 160, 199, and 145 scrambled to sell. Upon hearing news of successful loans, there was a sudden, catastrophic drop, plunging to 4,330 yuan. 197, 183, 97, and 85 seized the opportunity to buy low, rising to 4,450 yuan. 152, 145, 48, 12, 235, 223, and 61 all sold. People's hearts were already apprehensive, and Delivery Yonggong and spot Delivery Mei Ya both fell to the limit down, forcing the price down to 4,170 yuan. 85, 117, 179, and 171 seized the opportunity to buy low, once rising to 4,370 yuan. 145, 223, and 24 took advantage of the high price to close out positions, and the noon close hovered around 4,250 yuan. After the close, there was a slight increase to 4,300 yuan. As a result, compared to the previous close, Xinguang rose by half a percent, Zhongfa rose slightly, Yonggong and Mei Ya fell to the limit down, Yongsheng and Xinhua each fell by slightly less than ten percent, Huafeng fell by slightly less than half a percent, and Jingfu fell slightly. Delivery Xinguang rose to the limit up before pulling back slightly, Yongsheng and Xinhua rose slightly, Yonggong rose by slightly more than ten percent, and although Mei Ya fell to the limit down, it still rose by half a percent, because there was only half a day of trading the day before. The cold stock Innerwear rose to the limit up before falling slightly, still up by ten percent. Xinya and Lian rose by half a percent, Shangwu rose slightly, Zhongsheng fell slightly, Huochai fell by slightly less than ten percent, and the rest all fell by about half a percent.

In the afternoon, prices were already being called higher off-market. Affected by the tightening of foreign exchange rates reported by foreign news agencies, Delivery Yongsheng even rose to 4,500 yuan. 145, 165, and 97 sold at high prices, and the market opened only to fall to 4,380 yuan. 186, 177, 218, 232, 105, 85, 155, and 129 bought. Innerwear was the first to show a gain, led by 43, and soon Yongsheng rose again to 4,620 yuan. 85, 97, 167, 112, 129, 4, 2, 149, 154, 89, 48, 69, 224, 45, 141, 84, and 197 sold, and there was news of delayed issuance of large banknotes. After three o'clock, the market finally fell to 4,340 yuan. 152, 171, 169, and 89 seized the opportunity to buy low. The market was pulled up to around 4,530 yuan at the close. Mei Ya continued to trade at the limit down. Delivery Xinguang saw activity and closed at the limit up. As a result, compared to the previous close, Xinguang still had a large number of buyers. After rising to the limit up in the morning, it pulled back slightly. In the afternoon, it almost approached the limit up and was forced up by a slightly less than half a percent squeeze. Jingfu and Zhongfa rose slightly, Yongsheng fell slightly, Xinhua and Huafeng fell by slightly less than ten percent, and Yonggong fell to the limit down before recovering slightly, still down by slightly less than ten percent. Mei Ya fell to the limit down. As for delivery, Xinguang opened and closed at the limit up. Because there was only half a day of trading the day before, the rest of the stocks were squeezed up quite a bit. Mei Ya recovered after falling to the limit down, still up by half a percent. Yongsheng, Xinhua, Huafeng, and Yonggong rose by slightly less than ten percent to slightly less than half a percent. Jingfu was squeezed up by twenty percent. The cold stock Innerwear rose to the limit up. Cement was flat. Zhongfang and Tongyi fell by a little over ten percent. The rest of the stocks saw little trading. Except for Lian, which rose by half a percent, the rest fell by anywhere from slightly to half a percent. Off-market, Dasheng rose slightly, and the rest fell slightly.

Arbitrage Trading Banks Wait and See

For current and delivery arbitrage trading, the Yongsheng spread rose from 140 yuan to 22 yuan. Banks' willingness to participate was lackluster, as the base price had increased, and the unfavorable factors of the delivery prospects had intensified, suggesting preventive measures. It is reported that a large commercial bank had not rolled over half of its chips, causing the longs, such as 89, to actively seek to offer, creating a situation of too many monks and too little porridge. Today, the interest rate ranged from 1.1 fen to slightly less than 2 fen. The financial institutions also offered little in stocks such as Xinhua and Mei Ya, at a monthly interest rate of about 1.7 to 1.8 fen. The money market shows signs of tightening, reversing the situation of previous periods.

Hongri Xinguang Shines Brilliantly

Yesterday, Delivery Xinguang made its debut, showing its brilliance. It opened at 163, with 204 bidding to buy at 146.5 yuan, and immediately reached the limit up. The market price pulled back slightly in the middle as small investors sold to take profits, and the noon close was 135 yuan, with Baiguang at 130 yuan. After the afternoon close, people's hearts were uplifted, new longs joined in and aggressively bought, and financial institutions bought heavily. The market closed again at the limit up. It is rumored that a major player has organized a long company to push up Xinguang, with an initial target of 200 yuan.

Jinglun Listed Today

### China General Chamber of Commerce Bank Celebrates its 50th Anniversary at Lido Garden Tomorrow

China General Chamber of Commerce Bank, the first bank initiated in our country, will celebrate its 50th anniversary tomorrow (the 26th). All staff members of the bank's headquarters and branches in Shanghai will gather at their respective service units at 8:00 AM, led by their supervisors, to raise the flag and perform a commemorative ceremony. The history of the bank will be reported, and Chairman Du Yuesheng's motto of "Diligence, Prudence, Loyalty, and Respect" will be explained, encouraging colleagues to continue their efforts, cooperate with the national financial policy, guide industry and commerce, serve society, and make the bank's future even more brilliant.

From 9:00 AM, each unit will receive congratulations from relatives and friends and handle commemorative deposit and loan business. The bank's branches are distributed throughout the country, from Hangzhou and Ningbo in the east, to Lanzhou and Ningxia in the west, to Chongqing and Chengdu in the southwest, and to Tianjin in the north. They will all hold commemorative ceremonies simultaneously. Starting at 2:00 PM, the bank's headquarters will hold a celebration ceremony at Lido Garden on Taixing Road and exhibit the bank's cultural relics. Heads of agencies and leaders from all walks of life have been invited to participate in the grand ceremony. Chairman Du will personally preside over the opening ceremony, and the First Studio of the Central Film Photography Factory will send personnel to the venue to produce a sound newsreel for remembrance.

Furthermore, Chairman Du, with the virtue of frugality and love for the people, proposed to economize on banquets and extravagance and allocate 100 million yuan as a scholarship fund to subsidize 50 outstanding and impoverished college and middle school students, enabling them to continue their studies and become useful to the country. This proposal has been unanimously approved by the Board of Directors and Supervisors. The proposal has received great attention from all walks of life. Speaker Pan of the Shanghai Municipal Council and leaders from industry, commerce, and finance have jointly published an advertisement in response, urging colleagues and friends to contribute to the cause, convert gifts into cash, and entrust the bank's scholarship fund management committee to collect and manage them, using them all for the scholarship fund, so that the number of scholarships for college and middle school students can be increased according to the proportion of income beyond the bank's original quota.

For days, cash has been sent in an endless stream to be collected by the bank's headquarters and branches in and out of the city. The deadline is set for the end of this month, and a summary table will be compiled and published in the newspaper. Moreover, people from distant provinces have sent letters to the bank, expressing their deep admiration for Chairman Du and hoping that this will further promote public opinion, and that legal entities and public and private enterprises will jointly promote the scholarship movement, transform social customs, support education, and eliminate illiteracy, which is an essential plan for national construction. It is reported that the bank is considering conveying this suggestion to the public opinion organs for adoption.

### Bond Solicitation Committee Hosted the Press Yesterday; The People's Love for the Government Can Be Demonstrated by the Results of Bond Solicitation

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Shanghai Solicitation Committee for the 36th Short-Term Treasury Bonds and US Dollar Bonds, in order to expand the publicity of bond solicitation, specially hosted the Shanghai press yesterday at 5:00 PM on the 14th floor of the International Hotel. The chairman of the committee, Qian Xinzhi, vice-chairmen Xu Jixun and other officials and forty to fifty reporters from various newspapers attended the meeting. First, Chairman Qian Xinzhi stood up and delivered a speech, stating that he and Vice-Chairmen Du Yuesheng and Xu Jixun were jointly hosting the Shanghai press today. Vice-Chairman Du could not attend due to dental problems, for which he expressed his deep apologies. He was quite optimistic about the prospects for this new bond solicitation. Given that the government had issued a large number of banknotes in the past, both the government and the people felt difficulties. It is now known that the purpose of issuing new bonds is to absorb floating capital. If the people can subscribe in large quantities, it will not only solve the government's difficulties but also solve their own difficulties. The government's temporary measures to deal with the current economic situation include the promulgation of new economic emergency measures. The fundamental measures, such as the promotion of new bonds, are an important aspect of this. The people's love for the government can be determined by the success of the bond solicitation. Good results have been demonstrated in the past three weeks. The press has made great contributions in helping to publicize, and it is hoped that they will provide even more assistance with publicity in the future. Vice-Chairman Xu Jixun then delivered a speech, stating that the government had no choice but to issue new bonds due to the imbalance in financial revenue and expenditure. The purpose was to contract the currency and to encourage savings. He hoped that the press would provide more assistance with publicity so that the work of soliciting new bonds could be smoothly promoted. Afterwards, reporters from various newspapers delivered speeches, expressing their commitment to assisting with the publicity of the solicitation and hoping that the government would devote itself to maintaining the integrity of the bonds. Subsequently, Deputy Secretary-General Fan Heyan reported that so far, the US dollar bonds had been subscribed with confidence for US$30 million. The China Bank and its branches would jointly subscribe for US$10 million, and the Small Four Banks would subscribe for US$200,000. Moreover, the total amount solicited by various banks and firms today (the 24th) also reached US$420,000. The tea party ended at 6:30 PM.

In other news, in order to strengthen the solicitation work, the Shanghai Solicitation Committee for US Dollar Bonds was broadcasted last night by Chairman Qian Yongming from the Shanghai Joint Radio Station at 8:05 PM, under the title "Please Enthusiastically Subscribe to US Dollar Bonds."

### Grain Prices Soar Everywhere

Hangzhou

[Report from Our Newspaper, Hangzhou, 24th] Rice prices in Japan have skyrocketed, causing panic among the people. Chairman Shen expressed great concern about this and decided to allocate 110,000 piculs of grain from the provincial treasury to sell to public school personnel in Hangzhou at par to alleviate the immediate emergency. The Hangzhou Rice and Grain Purchase and Sale Committee also scheduled an emergency meeting tomorrow to discuss countermeasures. Today, the price of rice in Hangzhou, including the distribution of rough rice, is still 127,000.

Nanchang

[Report from Our Newspaper, Nanchang, 23rd] A long drought has been relieved by timely rainfall, and spring plowing is promising, which farmers celebrate. Grain prices in various counties have soared. Late rice in Ganxian and Yongfang and other places is selling for 150,000 yuan, and yarn prices have also broken the highest record. There are no transactions in the gold market.

Shenyang

[Report from Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 24th] The grain problem in Shenyang has recently become serious. The price of sorghum rice has not only risen but has also been reported to be in short supply, causing the people to cry out in distress. Various people's organizations have blamed the relevant agencies.

[Report from Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 24th] The Executive Yuan's Economic Committee convened a meeting on the 24th to stabilize grain prices, presided over by Xiong Shihui himself. During the meeting, he strictly ordered the relevant departments to thoroughly implement resolutions on management, transportation, and sanctions, expecting that the flow of grain would be smooth and prices would fall.

Fuzhou

[Report from Our Newspaper, Fuzhou, 24th] Amid rising grain prices, students cannot attend classes on an empty stomach. Schools in various parts of Fujian Province have wired the provincial government, requesting funds to subsidize the purchase of school rice. The Provincial Department of Education is finding ways to allocate tax rice for sale at low prices.

### Black Market for US Dollars Rampant; Export Trade Stalled

[Report from Our Newspaper] According to sources in the export sector, the rampant black market for US dollars has been extremely detrimental to the future of exporters. Most merchants holding export goods are holding on to their goods and not selling. Therefore, the transactions of export goods have been extremely rare recently, but prices are still relatively stable. It is reported that ordinary woolen clothing is priced at more than 6 million per barrel, tung oil is 410,000 per dan, and Shanghai bristles are 2.6 million per dan. Some prices have increased by 10% to 20%, but most have not changed. There has not been a dramatic increase due to the issuance of large banknotes by the National Bank. Moreover, according to the current domestic market prices of various export goods, there are still many instances of reverse pricing compared to foreign market prices. For example, for tung oil, the domestic market price is about US$0.35 per pound, while the market price of tung oil in the United States is only US$0.30 per pound. Other items, such as rhubarb and gallnuts, cannot be exported based on current domestic market prices. Currently, China's export trade is almost entirely stalled except for some tung oil materials exported by the Central Trust Bureau and the China Vegetable Oil Factory. After the exchange rate of the US dollar was adjusted to 12,000 yuan, export trade only showed a slight improvement for half a month to a month after the adjustment. However, the good times did not last long, and the favorable trend of export trade was completely disrupted by the gradual increase in export goods and the rising trend of the black market for US dollars. The current solution, on the one hand, is to hope that domestic prices will stabilize and that the black market for US dollars will be eliminated. At the same time, it is hoped that foreign market prices can be slightly increased, so that China's export trade can be revived.

### Medical Newspaper Articles and Magazine Articles

— Fan Shouyuan

Writing articles is a difficult and arduous task. Writing medical articles is even more difficult and laborious. Ordinary articles can contain empty words and useless phrases. However, because medicine is a science, it must rely on concrete facts to speak truthfully. Say what needs to be said, and no more. If too little is written, the meaning will not be clear. If too much is written, the text will be too verbose. This is unlike other articles, especially those of a literary nature. The same article can be altered according to the writer's skill: it can be long or short, expanded or contracted.

Medical texts can be roughly divided into two categories: One is popular articles written specifically for the general public; the other is scholarly articles written for the medical community itself for research or discussion. For now, I will call the first type of popular text "Newspaper Articles"; and I will name the second type of scholarly article written for research or discussion within the medical community itself "Magazine Articles."

The terms "Newspaper Articles" and "Magazine Articles" are not entirely appropriate in a strict sense. This is because many medical magazines are specifically intended for the general public, and their content consists of articles on general knowledge. However, I am using these two terms merely as a general and hypothetical designation. Generally speaking, there are more newspaper readers than magazine readers, and newspaper readers are primarily members of the general public. Although some medical magazines are written specifically for the public, they are not as accessible or likely to attract public attention as articles in newspapers.

What are the differences between newspaper articles and magazine articles? As mentioned above, one type consists of popular texts written for the public, while the other type consists of scholarly texts written for research, discussion, and reporting within the medical community. In other words, although the writers of popular texts for the public are scientific experts from the medical community, the readers are mostly members of the general public outside the medical field. On the other hand, both the writers and readers of magazine articles are members of the medical community itself.

Because newspaper articles and magazine articles have such different natures, doctors in the medical field who take the time to write medical articles need to pay attention to the writing techniques involved.

To write magazine articles for the medical community, one only needs to accurately and directly present one's own research findings, factual situations, or theoretical opinions. All medical terms or specialized vocabulary within the text can be written down directly without the need for explanation. This is because the readers are all medical professionals who understand all these specialized medical terms and scientific vocabulary. Explaining them in detail would be redundant. Conversely, if one is writing newspaper articles for the general public, one must pay attention to the tastes of the readers – the general public. A child's food is not the same as an adult's food, because their stomachs have different digestive and absorptive capacities. Similarly, the general public, who often lack medical knowledge, and medical professionals naturally have different levels of understanding of medical texts. For example, when writing magazine articles for the medical community, one can write down any medical terms or scientific vocabulary as one wishes, without needing to explain them. However, when writing newspaper articles for the general public who lack medical knowledge, one must put in the effort to explain these specialized medical terms and fixed vocabulary in detail so that the readers can understand their meaning. An infant who has not yet grown milk teeth cannot chew sweet and hard Liangxiang chestnuts. Otherwise, the writer's efforts will be wasted, and the readers will still not be able to taste the flavor of the text.

Let me give a few examples: "Prognosis"—is this not a specialized term that we often use when writing medical articles? This most common and simple medical term is easily understood by medical professionals. It refers to our prediction of the good or bad outcome of a disease based on the "type" and "nature" of the disease, the "severity" of the patient's condition, the patient's past "constitution," and the "effectiveness" of current medical treatment, etc. However, the general public who lack medical knowledge would most likely not understand the meaning of this term. Or, for example, is there not a term called "expectant therapy" in therapeutics? This "expectant therapy" is also commonly used when writing medical articles. Medical professionals can easily understand this common term and know that the meaning of "expectant therapy" is: When encountering a disease for which there is no fundamental cure, the only thing to do is to maintain the patient's strength during the disease's course so that he can easily tolerate the various symptoms that occur, prevent its abnormal progression and the occurrence of other "complications," and quietly wait for the disease to run its course. In that case, the disease can often achieve a good "natural cure" effect. If the general public who lack medical knowledge were to read this term "expectant therapy" without a detailed explanation, how would they understand its meaning? Of course, such examples are everywhere and countless.

In addition to paying attention to such specialized medical terms and specialized vocabulary when writing newspaper articles, one must also pay attention to the text itself. The text itself must be simple, popular, clear, and lively. This is true for all scientific writing, but it is especially true for medical articles, particularly newspaper articles written for the general public. Simple and popular texts are more accessible, clarity makes them easier to understand, and liveliness can generate interest in the reader. Therefore, these are all important conditions that must be noted when writing medical newspaper articles.

"Vernacular writing" is simpler and more popular than "Classical Chinese," and it is easier to write clearly. As for liveliness, those who are good at using vernacular writing can often write very vividly and powerfully. Therefore, for medical articles, especially medical newspaper articles, I think it is better to use vernacular writing as much as possible. However, those who are not good at writing vernacular writing may write long articles, but readers will not feel its "simplicity" and "clarity," but will instead feel that it is a long and rambling piece that does not explain anything clearly. They will only feel that it is verbose and not lively or powerful. Therefore, writing simple and popular texts is not an easy task! It still depends on the writer's skill and talent, and the writer's ease of expression.

### Pay Attention to Oral Hygiene

— Wang Gongfu

Our teeth are the gateway to the stomach, and the oral cavity is the general hub of both the food and air passages. The frequent comings and goings inevitably attract the covetousness of bacteria, which breed in the mouth. Some argue that the human mouth is clean, but this is a gross error. Who knows that the oral cavity, holding the power of import and export, is also a good gateway for bacteria to invade? Especially in the crevices between dental plaque and cavities, there are countless bacteria lurking. The number of bacteria in the mouth is actually greater than in any other part of the body. The bacteria that breed in the oral cavity come in many shapes and types. In terms of their shape, they can be roughly divided into three types: spherical, rod-shaped, and spiral. Because the bacteria that can reside in the oral cavity include any type, its inherent bacteria can also be divided into seven categories: (1) Oral giant bacillus: lives in unclean oral cavities, (2) Fusiform bacillus: commonly found in alveolar pyorrhea, ulcerative stomatitis, and the mouths of ordinary people, (3) Salivary spirochete: can often be seen in oral saliva, especially in the gums, (4) Staphylococci: often parasitizes in unclean gums and dental plaque, (5) Oral branched bacteria: can be seen in gingivitis and alveolar pyorrhea, (6) Sheathed iodine cocci: mostly found in dental plaque, (7) Dental spirochete: the most common site is the gums. Furthermore, because the oral cavity often contains various organic and inorganic substances, it is a most suitable natural nutrient source for bacterial life. In addition, the appropriate temperature and light in the mouth, movement and stillness, are all in line with the guidelines for their development. Oxygen, carbon salts, moisture, etc., also meet the basic elements for their survival (among which moisture is the most indispensable nutrient). Therefore, the reproduction of bacteria in the mouth is extremely strong. Because bacteria are also known as fission bacteria, they reproduce by fission. For example, when spherical bacteria divide, they first become oval, then split horizontally in the center to become two young bacteria; rod-shaped bacteria elongate in their length, then split into two. In this way, one becomes two, two becomes four, four becomes eight, and eventually proliferates to countless.

In order to avoid bacterial reproduction or kill them, some people often think that they can use some kind of strong, liquid mouthwash to drive them away. In fact, this situation is also absurd (it cannot be eradicated completely). If you want to reduce the reproduction of bacteria in the mouth, you need to fully remove the tartar accumulated in the dental socket (a hard substance accumulated on the outside of the tooth neck is called tartar). Therefore, this work must be done by a dentist. Drs. Ryder and Smith of the United States once said: "To keep your teeth healthy, you need to have a dentist clean them twice a month." But in reality, it is enough for us to implement this two or three times a year.

Oral hygiene should not be ignored, especially after baby teeth erupt in young children. Attention should be paid to the oral and dental hygiene, and the fingers should be used frequently to dip sterile cotton wool in 3% borax water to wipe them. Once the permanent teeth have fully erupted, they should be taken to the dentist for examination to see if there are any decayed teeth. If there are any, they should be treated early to avoid spreading to nearby teeth. At the same time, attention should be paid to brushing teeth, and they should be urged to do it perfectly. It is the same for us. We often neglect the method of brushing teeth and do not understand it. It is wrong to only brush the outside without brushing the inside, or to only brush horizontally from left to right. Therefore, when brushing teeth, you must first choose a smaller toothbrush with slightly harder bristles and a slightly curved shape. When brushing, you should make rotary motions from top to bottom, and each tooth should be brushed on the left, right, inside, and outside. Do this three times a day, especially the one at night, because food residue stays in the mouth overnight and can form a fermentation phenomenon and the reproduction of bacteria can damage the enamel of the teeth. If the teeth are not healthy and the chewing function is weak, the digestion of food will stop the stomach yang, easily causing gastrointestinal diseases and causing the whole body to lose health. Someone once made a statistic and said: "Every time you brush your teeth properly, you can remove one-third of the bacteria in the oral cavity." "Brushing teeth" is truly the only good way to remove bacteria from yourself.

The above is a little bit, dedicated to you readers, and I advise parents to pay attention to the future masters of the next generation and their own happiness.

### Calcium Gluconate

— Shen Songnian

After reading Dr. Song Guobin's article "A Review of the Combined Injection of Calcium Gluconate and Vitamin C" in the fourth issue of this journal, I was filled with doubts. It is originally reasonable to use calcium gluconate and vitamin C together. Most doctors in Shanghai use this method. Because pulmonary tuberculosis consumes too much vitamin C, it must be replenished as much as possible. This is well known; otherwise, dry mouth, dry tongue, and dry skin will accelerate death! When encountering such patients, injecting 500 international units is not enough, and 5,000 to 10,000 units are also commonly known. Dr. Song insisted that its scientific name has the word "acid" and that it is made from sour oranges, so based on the point that "acidic substances may dissolve exposed substances," he thought that vitamin C could invalidate calcium. I ask, will the vitamin C originally in the patient's body also invalidate calcium! Therefore, I dare not agree with Dr. Song's high opinion. Is this the first point?

Dr. Song thought that "fibrous pulmonary tuberculosis patients already have saturated calcium levels in their bodies, and calcium injections may not be beneficial." By analogy, if calcium injections can be injected to saturation, wouldn't the patient become a malachite model? How much lime is in a calcium injection? Who doesn't know that most of the calcium in a calcium injection will flow out (be excreted from the body) after injection? Therefore, it is necessary to advise patients to take cod liver oil at the same time, borrowing the power of vitamin D to make the calcium settle. This is the second point.

As for elderly patients, Dr. Song thought that "injecting calcium agents again will make vascular sclerosis even worse." Is there any factual evidence to support this point? I also have great doubts. Even if this is the case, it is no different from giving up eating for fear of choking. For all pulmonary tuberculosis patients, regardless of gender, age, now using "calcium gluconate" for treatment is not considered outdated, and sometimes it lasts for two or three years without seeing any drawbacks. Whether or not vascular sclerosis is a secondary issue, because if pulmonary tuberculosis is not treated rationally, death will be faster than vascular sclerosis. This is the third point.

In short, without animal experiments to prove that "vitamin C can indeed invalidate calcium," the contradictory statement of calcium gluconate and vitamin C seems difficult to conclude.

Editor's Note: Mr. Shen Songnian's article has some insightful comments on Mr. Song Guobin's assertion in the previous issue that "calcium gluconate should not be injected together with vitamin C." However, whether it is harmful to inject calcium gluconate and vitamin C in the same syringe into the patient's veins still needs to be examined by experts. The human body itself has its own "unique" function for controlling and dispatching acids and calcium. We cannot make wild guesses. Whether there is a chemical reaction between calcium and acid before they are injected into the vein after being mixed in the same syringe awaits examination by pharmaceutical experts. However, the benevolent see benevolence, and the wise see wisdom. Xiangren does not take sides, so let both exist for the time being.

### The Mystery of the New Chinese Medicine (4)

— Hong Guanzhi

In addition, the several outlines of "cold, heat, deficiency, excess, exterior, and interior," which have always been used as the basis for syndrome differentiation, belong to a part of simple common sense and do not contain any profound philosophy. Although there are many places that secretly coincide with science, it is still a knowledge without understanding the principles and cannot be considered a foundation of learning. This is beyond doubt. Now I repeat here that the subjective experience must be consistently recognized and undisputed by the majority of people before it can be called experience. Therefore, Chinese medicine is not a "product of experience" and cannot be arbitrarily attached to. As for objective experience, Chinese medicine cannot presumptuously boast about it, let alone say more! If readers can carefully seek out all the contradictions in Chinese medicine theory and application with a calm mind, and then see what the experience that Chinese medicine talks about is all about? Whether the "phenomena" they experience are "facts" and whether they can hit the object and talk about the "essence," if you analyze it in detail, the question of "What is Chinese medicine?" can be roughly answered!

(3) Further Explanation for Scientification

Chinese medicine theory is "mystical," and the clinical aspect relies on a part of simple common sense. It is not real "experience," let alone called learning. It is not "scientific," of course, needless to say. However, even now there are still people who do not understand "science"! It is truly strange to say "Chinese medicine should not be westernized, it should be scientificized." Moreover, this wonderful article was also published in mid-December last year. Comparing it with Mr. Lu's article can be said to be interestingly contrasting. The author of this article is a Chinese medicine doctor named Mou Yunfang Guangsheng, who works in the Zhejiang Provincial Party Department. He opposes the scientificization method of "using Chinese medicine like Western medicine" and advocates the so-called "automatic Westernization." At first glance, he is a "Chinese body, Western use" theorist. After reading this wonderful theory, I couldn't help but shiver (not seeing a ghost in broad daylight, please don't misunderstand). This kind of fantasy of "Chinese body, Western use" has been tried by many people as early as twenty years ago, and it has failed without reservation. I think Mr. Mou has no common sense of historical evolution, so he will promote reversing the car. According to his meaning, "Chinese medicine" seems to be able to exist in the world for a long time and permanently oppose "Western medicine." However, it also needs to be improved and improved. His so-called "scientificization" is very vague. He probably wants to find a way to make Chinese medicine an independent discipline. Then how can it be worthy of the title of "scientificization"? This makes me have to say a few simple words about the nature of medicine and the definition of science, because people are "higher animals" in the metaphysical realm (that which is in the metaphysical realm is called a tool, and a tool is a physical object, not a wandering soul). Medicine is a learning that studies human physiology and disease treatment, so it is a "scientific" product, not "metaphysical philosophy." Moreover, the science mentioned here refers to "science in the narrow sense," which is the abbreviation of "natural science" in contrast to philosophy; in other words, it is scientific medicine that applies various natural scientific methods, such as biological mathematics, physics, and chemistry, for research (also commonly known as Western medicine). Mr. Mou believes that "the fundamental ideas of Eastern and Western cultures are completely different, so the knowledge of Chinese and Western medicine is also different. Europe has had the concept of things from the beginning, and everything is considered to be the reality of things." This statement completely obliterates history. I won't say anything else, just medicine. The predecessor of Western medicine also grew up in "mystical theory" like Chinese medicine, and it also went through a process of fantasy. They used to have medical theories of earth, water, wind, and fire. However, because of the progress of various aspects of natural science in the past 100 years, medicine has embarked on the road of science and become a new and independent science. From the perspective of philosophical thought or temperament and habits, Eastern and Western cultures have their differences, but medicine is "material" and not "spiritual." There is fundamentally no distinction between "Eastern" and "Western" cultures. (To be continued)

### Informing Readers About Questions in Medical and Pharmaceutical Q&A

— Liang Jun

In the first issue of this publication, I pointed out the difficulties of serving in medical and pharmaceutical Q&A and admitted the failure of this work in other publications in the past. I once had a hope to collect many similar questions together and give detailed general answers, and at the same time delete many unnecessary and unreasonable questions. This would not only benefit most readers but also reduce the trouble of editing. However, because this publication is edited by different editors in rotation, each person has their own ideas and style, so my suggestion could not be implemented.

Recently, the editorial department of this publication has received many articles from readers criticizing the impracticality of this medical and pharmaceutical Q&A, "It cannot enable the questioner to get an answer in the short term, nor can it enable other readers to learn from it and benefit from it. As a result, it is inevitable to be superficial or to have the suspicion of promoting drugs." Mr. Youxian's article "Evaluation of Medical and Pharmaceutical Q&A" in the Tianjin Ta Kung Pao Medical Weekly last month more bluntly criticized the shortcomings of medical and pharmaceutical Q&A published in various newspapers' medical and pharmaceutical supplements. This really makes us editors greatly awaken.

Originally, we did the work of medical and pharmaceutical questions with a spirit of sacrifice. We definitely did not mean what the Tianjin Ta Kung Pao said, "Some mediocre doctors do some medical and pharmaceutical Q&A because their business is depressed, and they write their own names on each article to attract customers." That kind of meaning. However, the result is such public opinion, which is of course beyond our initial expectations. For now, we review the past and encourage the future. Naturally, there is a need to change the method. Therefore, we specifically tell readers that from now on, we will no longer answer medical and pharmaceutical questions that are too simple and too unsystematic. On the contrary, if a patient can describe his own medical history in detail, and his own observations and the process of diagnosis and treatment by Chinese and Western medicine, then we will definitely give an answer.

Some people think that medical and pharmaceutical Q&A is unscientific and should not exist. This is a arrogant person who speaks big words with his eyes closed. If he has read medical and pharmaceutical magazines or medical and pharmaceutical supplements in European and American countries, then he will definitely know that he should not speak with his eyes closed like this.

Okay, let's not talk too much nonsense, but I hope our sacrificial work will contribute to the readers!

Spring and Autumn

### The Double Confession of Hawaii

— By Fassett, Translated by Qing

Her throat felt like scalded muscle, and she asked her husband for another glass of water. Aaron couldn't help but feel a shiver down his spine at her weak voice.

She was lying in front of a widely opened window. All sorts of breezes, nourished by a fragrant and joyful land and imbued with fragrant fats, filled their temporary wooden house with their breath. They brought the bitter fragrance of giant aloe, the sour taste of banana groves, and the natural aroma of the sea. The sun had just risen above the top of this island. A rosy seafoam further diluted the purple-blue taste of countless waves, and sometimes, within these waves, an even stronger ray of sunlight darted like a golden serpent.

"Please listen..." the young woman murmured.

At this moment, very near or very far – it was impossible to tell – a barely discernible song, accompanied by ancient instrumental music and clear vocal music, drifted over.

"Hawaiian guitars, Kittredge," Aaron replied. "Do these sounds make you uncomfortable? I'll send the servants to chase away these singers."

"No, Aaron, I beg you, please let them sing. They are good for me."

Exhausted by the abruptness she used in this plea, Kittredge gently turned her head to the side. Her arms, which had been folded across her chest, also loosened in a weak gesture. After a night of cold time, which made her feel that her whole body was nothing but broken wounds and fire, she now appreciated the sparse light of dawn with sensual pleasure.

Beneath her half-closed eyelids, her gaze wandered over the large garden, full of rare flowers and proud palm trees standing like sentinels. Further away, in the rice paddies, countless brown men were already bending over the ditches...

Finally, the young woman's heart, which had been working with difficulty, now beat even more heavily.

All this, the flourishing trees, the flower beds, the fields full of bright fertility and resources, was entirely Aaron's creation and territory. There was nothing that did not belong to him, including the coral reefs that the waves of the Pacific Ocean had just broken upon encountering them, nothing that did not bear the mark of his power and will.

How many times before, leaning by this sunlit window, Kittredge had felt a vague dread creep into her heart as she looked at this vista. What was the nature of her isolation from the world, living in the middle of these wild and fertile lands, her husband the sole master of these lands, countless gazes of glittering barbarians all bending their backs to serve these lands?

Slowly, she looked at him with a dark fear. He sat beside her with his head bowed, and Kittredge could only see his stiff, graying hair and his strong, dark gray nape. But everything about him was so naturally regular and even that she believed she could see his face at this moment: square forehead, aquiline nose, tightly closed mouth with strong lines, pointed chin.

"Is there anything I can do for you, sweetheart?" he asked softly.

"Will the doctor finally come?"

"The city is not close, and Ah Chen didn't go to get him until dawn."

In the young woman's heart, she felt a strange glimmer of triumph flash in her husband's eyes. Then the fear that often radiated from behind this hard mask made her tremble, stronger and more piercing than the high fever in her body.

As if he had guessed this distress, he raised his long, wrinkled fingers and placed them on Kittredge's forehead, then began to caress it. Initially alarmed by this touch, she gradually calmed down. Her previous fear had been in vain. Aaron loved her. Perhaps he loved her crudely and clumsily, but this love was like a fierce and profound fire that was difficult to recognize. She had already seen how attentive he was to her every desire, and how he often trembled with joy in his embrace. Hadn't he cared for her with patient and tender solicitude all night long yesterday? Since he belonged to her, and she was the one who could disrupt his life with a revelation, then why fear him?

The weakness that withered her young body relaxed her aversion to Aaron and moved her soul. Then a remorse awakened in her heart, and immediately dissipated, as if this remorse aroused a desire to recognize this face she no longer loved with a large amount of generosity.

She turned her head frankly towards him, a quick movement he had not anticipated; then she uttered a soft cry.

Because, in the lines of this face that had never been submissive, she saw a sadness so deep and a tenderness so poignant that she gained a horrifying certainty: death was already here, in this empty room, on these simple furnishings, and her husband had already seen the footsteps of death.

Many beautiful, bronze-like human skins were shining in the sun, which was more scorching than before. The sea breeze brought over a richer and more mixed fragrance, and the surface of the Pacific Ocean was nothing more than a large expanse of scorching jade.

Never had a loneliness more ferocious than this moment of certainty surrounded Kittredge. In helplessness, she really felt the need to cling tightly to this only man, so close at hand. But in order for this final communion to be sweet and helpful, she should tell him everything:

"Aaron!" she murmured in a voice that was already hoarse. "I don't want to take away a secret that is too serious without getting your forgiveness."

She paused, took another breath, and continued:

"I have not been faithful... Three days ago, a British warship sailed away. It carried a sign..."

At the end of her strength, she fell silent. Aaron looked at her, her face pale; he said to her in a calm voice:

"Me too, I need forgiveness, Kittredge. I know everything. That's why I used the poison of the Hawaiian medicine man on you yesterday." (Original text from the French weekly "Courrier de Chine" No. 6 by J. Kessel)

### Reencountering Mei Jiu in Jiangnan in the Spring of Dinghai

— Li Qing

The master will transplant the "Guo Feng" on the sea.

Escaping Qin, living by the sea, home long gone, suddenly I see old plum blossoms blooming again; eagerly I ask, "Is Guo Feng well?" Not shirking responsibility, it sends forth heroic blossoms.

"Guo Feng" and "Jin Cheng" were heroic pioneers, no less than securing the rivers and mountains; today the old plum tree is still proud, the new splendor lonely, palace flowers red.

Responding to the two poems presented by old comrade Zhang Liqing in the original rhyme - Old Plum

Ignoring the home in the years of exile, I rub my old eyes, still seeing no flowers; praise has long soaked in the meritorious achievements, the "Poetry History" is a true blossom.

Wandering the world, spirited and heroic, dedicating myself to the revolution, ashamed to speak of merit; most pitifully, after the re-illumination of the Nine Regions, disaster arises within the walls, battle blood red!

### An Inch of Mountains and Rivers, an Inch of Blood 404

— Ye Jingfeng

"I have an absolutely secret coding method—a change of inorganic blended with organic, and it's simple and easy to learn."

"Show me the original copy." Shouyi reached out to ask for it.

"No way;" Hejian clapped his hands, "I didn't bring it with me; I rely entirely on memory… It doesn't matter, anyway, Zhengyan is here, he has the original coding copy and knows how to use organic methods…"

"Very good." Shouyi retracted the hand he had extended, "But this can only solve one aspect of cooperative technology, the transmission of messages—certainly, a very important aspect. There are also others: transportation, personnel, combat tools, symbols, language…"

"I think," Hejian's thoughts were stirred, and he also became enthusiastic, afraid of interrupting Shouyi's words lest he forget what he had thought of; "Since your Yu Jun and our Yue Big Brother are familiar, we will try to arrange for these two to meet once and discuss a concrete solution to these technical problems, so that everything between us is 'unified'… Unfortunately," Hejian clapped his palms again, as if he had lost an important document.

"Thought of something else?" Shouyi saw Hejian's appearance of scratching his ears and cheeks, his thoughts surging, and knew that he was a little over-excited at this time.

"It's hateful that there's no way to move some of our good players over to you, to let them be together for a period of time, even a short period of time, to let everyone merge and integrate their existing ideas, knowledge, and technology. That would be such a beautiful thing…

"The first is our Ji Yaoqun—a young lady of twenty-two or three; her intelligence and skills are truly first-rate—of course, I mean among the people I know now—there is also a Little Tiger, named Xiao Hucheng. How old do you think he is? …Only twelve years old—Chinese martial arts are also first-rate; if someone my size gently nudges him, I would have to crawl down. And that's being polite. Our Yue Big Brother personally saw him send two Japanese officers back to their hometown with two gentle touches." Hejian said as he performed.

"That's a heavy hand of the Daruma Palm type; which school is he practicing?" Shouyi also became interested.

"Alas, how would I understand these things?… The 'curious questions' I just mentioned refer to these things, and if Yue Big Brother hadn't said it so sincerely, I would hardly believe it. You see?…"

"Someone in my village has practiced this set;" Shouyi smiled slightly.

"Really?" The usually clever Hejian turned into a gourd at this time.

"Believe it or not!" Shouyi still smiled slightly.—The greatness of China, coupled with the confluence of thousands of years of civilization, and yet constantly suffering the oppression of how many dynasties of demon kings, with many talented and extraordinary figures focusing their attention, how many mysterious effects could be created! What is this little bit of martial arts worth?… It has always been suppressed by generations of demon kings, not allowing these figures to seize the opportunity to breathe, to cooperate with the times, and to advance towards material civilization… towards science, so that's why it has become such a terrible phenomenon…"

### A Call to Abolish Aesthetic Education

— Liu Shi

Yesterday I read the newspapers and discovered that the Curriculum Standards Revision Committee of the Ministry of Education will abolish the art subject in middle schools and replace it with "Practical Arts", which made me feel an inexplicable sadness, sadness for the youth, for the national culture, and for the future of the country!

Therefore, I can't help but briefly state my humble opinions, sincerely hoping that the education authorities will withdraw their order as soon as possible and not let outsiders laugh at us.

Regarding the general issue of aesthetic education, as early as twenty years ago, Mr. Cai Yuanpei repeatedly advocated it, and he explained it clearly enough for us. Some friends may even remember that Mr. Cai advocated "replacing religion with art"!

The lack and hardship of material life during the long war of resistance has indeed befallen most people. At this time, advocating "aesthetic education" seems to be out of touch with the trend, but it is not.

When the Constitution was established, didn't we also see a clear provision to "promote art"? Therefore, we once eased our brows slightly, but unexpectedly, today, after the government reorganization, the dignified Ministry of Education not only violates the Constitution, but also, following the Shanghai Municipal Council's proposal to "abolish art normal schools," simply plans to abolish the "art" classes in all secondary schools across the country. Which strong country is this educational policy imitating? It's really puzzling!

Although the War of Resistance has been won, what have we gained after eight years of hardship?

Lack of living materials, a pitiful and frightening human heart, destruction of religion and morality, chaos in social order, rampant corruption and bandits….

If this continues, how can national fortune be revived? How can the people live?

The difference between humans and other animals is that one relies on wisdom to control life, and the other relies on instinct to strive for life; the same is true for the division of humans into civilized and barbaric. The former is able to develop wisdom through the cultivation of a suitable personality, while the latter is unable to break free from the control of instinct and has no way to move upward, thus appearing ugly, stupid, rude, and vulgar.

Looking at countries around the world, how are the strong and the weak divided? How are rulers and the oppressed formed? I have never heard of a strong country without culture, nor have I seen a strong country weaken or destroy its own culture. If there is one, it is China.

Art is an important part of culture. Destroying art is tantamount to destroying culture, and destroying culture is tantamount to destroying the country.

Moreover, in the current China, where all material civilization is far inferior to Western Europe and the people's lives have reached extreme hardship, we should improve people's hearts and provide spiritual food, so that those who are trapped in poverty and pain will not succumb to poverty and pain, and those who are on the verge of despair; those who are not trapped in poverty and pain will not fall into idleness or tend to extravagance. In other words, a person who has been cultivated by aesthetic education has an eternally happy spirit, a noble temperament, and a pure soul; no matter which class he belongs to, he has a world in a pot; no matter when or in what situation, he will not be swayed or confused. He will always maintain tranquility, nourishment, youth, hope, and light. That is to say, he has obtained spiritual relief through the cultivation of beauty.

On the other hand, if we do not provide him with spiritual food to make his mind healthy, he will inevitably pursue material enjoyment. The painful become more painful, the unyielding yield (traitors are an example), the desperate commit suicide, and the idle become more extravagant, frivolous, and lewd. But in the end, their spirit is still painful, their temperament is bound to be perverse, and they only have a stinking shell without a true soul. Thus, betrayal, confusion, anxiety, desolation, disappointment, darkness... all envelop him layer by layer. On a small scale, it turns him into a machine for manufacturing dung, a living corpse. On a large scale, corrupt officials, traitors, and national traitors are all like this—educated to value only material things.

Therefore, I dare to say categorically: if we want to make human minds healthy and achieve true peace in the world, there is no other way but to strive for spiritual construction. A great educator should urgently and unreservedly take on this great mission. Moreover, we are not a militarist country with ambitious intentions, we do not need to regard education as a tool of war.

Furthermore: the purpose of Chinese education is to acquire the necessary general knowledge of all subjects in middle school: any country's middle school education can be used as a reference—even the materialistic Soviet Union has not abolished art education in middle schools, how can we progress to such an extent?

The purpose of my loud cry is not to seek a way out or beg for food for myself or on behalf of my colleagues; nor do I foolishly hope that every middle school student will enter the room of fragrant orchids, but I am only afraid that outsiders will come to China as if they have stepped into a shop selling stinky abalone and will all cover their noses and pass by.

Taking a few dozen steps back: if the middle school art class is for the so-called "practical arts" (according to the newspaper's joint Ministry of Education proposal), then, as Mr. Lü Fengzi said in his letter refuting the Ministry of Education: ..."Practical arts should at least include the production of practical and applicable objects, and how can one produce applicable objects without first making drawings? And how can one not seek to have beautiful forms? That is to say, even if we do not discuss the function of the art subject itself, but only in terms of teaching practical arts, we cannot do without relying on art..."

Even a deeply cultivated Mr. Lü said such a thing, but I don't know if the proposer of the Ministry of Education's proposal has thought about it like this? Furthermore, I don't know how he will answer? We are very interested in waiting. (April 23, at Ningbolou)

Free Talk

### Two Stages

— Mingtao

Some say that actors are crazy and playgoers are fools. Because the former treat the false drama as true, sometimes crying and sometimes laughing, acting like they have mental problems; while the latter treat the false drama as true, praising its "subtle and wonderful" qualities, and following the actors' weeping and laughing. In essence, they are both seeing the false as true, so the "philosophers" who are above mundane affairs judge them to be a madman and a fool.

Only when the audience enters the illusion of the stage in the theater can they gradually hide their reason, forget the environment they are in, and step by step move away from cleverness and wisdom, being stirred up by the dramatic effect. Only at this time are they willing to fool themselves by treating the false drama as true, even shedding tears as if they were facing sadness and joy in real life. But after leaving the theater, they absolutely refuse to admit that the plot of the drama that just moved them is "life." Their reason is right: "After all, this is just a play." And these audience members who wake up after the play are still inevitably seen as "fools," which is really unfair compared to the kind of audience we will talk about later.

A certain newspaper reported that the authorities, in view of the fact that the plots of Peking operas and spoken dramas in Shanghai recently mostly take the theme of satirizing, exposing, and impoverishing reality, which is enough to shake people's hearts, have consulted the Shanghai Municipal Government to ban them.

Unexpectedly, in our country, there is still such a group of audience members who are "faithful" to the drama, even when they leave the theater, and even when a basin of cold water is poured on them, completely calming their minds, they still stubbornly refuse to withdraw from the illusion of the stage, desperately "biting" the drama and shouting: "That's life, not a play! The leper clown on the stage is clearly alluding to me. The Qingyi next to him is singing 'light, bright, electric rod.' It's clear she deliberately made up lyrics to satirize me because she clearly knows I'm watching the play below."

I believe that it is useless to simply prohibit dramas with "satire" and "exposure" from being performed on the "drama stage." If on the "stage of life" there are more ruthless "satire" and "exposure" "events" (different from "plays") "happening" (different from "performing"), because it is only a conditional replica.

Only by stopping the occurrence of "events" can the reflection of plays be avoided. People spend most of their time living in real society, so they often watch the "plays" on the "stage of life," and the plots displayed here are even more satirical and exposed. How can they be "prohibited"?

### Protest of a Small City

— Leike

The other day, this newspaper had an exclusive interview with Shanghai County, the first section of which said: "Although Shanghai County is closely adjacent to Shanghai City, in any respect, it is still stuck in a backward stage like ordinary towns in the interior." The title of this article specifically pointed out that when the old and new county magistrates of this small Shanghai County were replaced, there was only 300,000 yuan left in cash.

As far as we know, any city or town that Shanghai people call the countryside is in the same situation as small Shanghai County: backward, and if there is a change of old and new county magistrates, the cash will not exceed 300,000 yuan. The so-called countryside actually includes all the large and small cities along the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines, and even eastern and western Zhejiang and northern Jiangsu, and even Suzhou and Hangzhou, which are known as paradise, are no exception.

Prosperity is concentrated in Shanghai, and outside Shanghai is poverty and backwardness. To explain the reasons for this畸形 development, it may take a lot of reasons, but the mere fact of this distortion is enough to make us vigilant. Now people in the interior are rushing to Shanghai, not for political and military reasons, but simply to earn more money. The income of the same person in Shanghai is about ten times higher than what he can get in the countryside. Because Shanghai has businesses, and the countryside has only a few places to eat. In Shanghai, he can speculate or work hard (taking on multiple jobs) to earn some money, while in the countryside he has no place to use his talents and can only stay hungry.

The number of unemployed people in Shanghai is gradually increasing, while the countryside is threatened by a lack of talent. Whether it is the political, academic, or business circles, all need excellent talents, but suffer from the inability to recruit them. As a result, the already stagnant interior is even more backward. However, it takes considerable courage to return to the countryside now. The wife of a county magistrate in a large county has to come out to teach in order to make a living, and the wife of a section chief has a large patch on her chest and walks on the street to buy groceries. This kind of spirit is admirable, but how many people in Shanghai are willing to go back and suffer this hardship?

Shanghai's prosperity cannot be an ivory tower; it must be built on a revitalized countryside. But who will revitalize the countryside?

### Taiwan's Hot Springs and Grass Mountain

— Lu Ming

Taiwan's climate is the crystallization of spring and summer, so with the exception of summer from March to September, the remaining half is all spring. Taiwan cannot talk about winter, nor can it find autumn.

Even strictly speaking, Taiwan's spring should come before February.

I would now like to introduce a tour of Taiwan's hot spring areas. If you have traveled to Taiwan, I think you must have visited Taiwan's hot spring areas, Grass Mountain and Beitou. The former is quiet and elegant, while the latter is full of bustling images, even with some vulgarity, so I love the former.

Grass Mountain is more than 700 meters above sea level, and it is very cool even in summer, so it is no exaggeration to say that she is "eternally youthful." She faces Guanyin Mountain, which resembles the head of Guanyin lying in nature. It is too beautiful, and one can only describe its beauty by experiencing it firsthand. And Guanghan's paddy fields, overlooking Taipei from afar, give one a feeling of being in heaven on earth. The warm climate makes people feel lazy, and a bath in the hot springs makes people feel refreshed. Walking in the evergreen small garden wearing a bathrobe, how many places in China can enjoy this?

And what is even more worth mentioning is that it is by no means something that only rich people can enjoy. She is very accessible to the common people. You can wander around here for a day for less than one or two hundred Taiwan dollars.

### A Look at Taiwan's Transportation

Mr. Editor:

I recently returned to Shanghai from Taiwan because I had some business to attend to. Every day, I had to take the tram and bus several times. Seeing the crowded and chaotic conditions on Shanghai's trams, I couldn't help but think of the orderly situation on Taiwan's buses. Therefore, I would like to borrow a corner of your newspaper to present the methods used on Taiwan's buses to the Shanghai transportation authorities as a reference for improvement.

They are:

(1) Tickets are not sold on the bus. There is a ticket office at each stop. These ticket offices are not specially established but are of an agency nature. Their rights and obligations are similar to the method of selling stamps and revenue stamps.

(2) Passengers board the bus with a ticket and hand the ticket to the ticket collector at the door for inspection. The ticket collector tears off the ticket stub and returns it to the passenger before boarding the bus (similar to the ticket collection method at movie theaters, but without receiving snacks). When getting off the bus, passengers hand the ticket to the ticket collector for cancellation.

(3) The fare is uniform, regardless of distance or route. Passengers can buy a booklet to carry with them and use it at any time, which is extremely convenient.

The above methods have many advantages, such as:

(1) It can reduce the trouble of the ticket conductor tearing tickets and making change.

(2) It can reduce the hardship of the ticket seller being squeezed among the passengers and, at the same time, reduce the opportunity for petty theft.

(3) After passengers board the bus, they no longer need to prepare to take out money to buy tickets, etc., and can buy tickets calmly at the ticket office before boarding the bus.

(4) If it is enforced that no boarding is allowed without a ticket (in Taiwan, even military and police personnel must buy half-price tickets), then the ticket inspection system can be abolished.

(5) The uniformity of the fare simplifies matters for both passengers and the company, which is self-evident. However, in Shanghai, there may be problems due to the multiple companies involved. But if unified management is implemented, this will not be a problem. These are my humble opinions. I wish you all the best!

A traveler from Taiwan, respectfully, April 22nd

### This Time's Symphony

— Ni Qiuping

The Shanghai Municipal Government Symphony Orchestra is scheduled to give a public performance at the Lyceum Theatre on April 27th (Sunday) at 5:00 PM. This is their first performance after reorganization, so I made a special trip to visit Professor Dai Cuilun—the host of the orchestra and also the president of the Conservatory of Music—who took some time out of his busy schedule to talk with me.

Originally, the position of president of the Conservatory of Music could not be held concurrently, but Mayor Wu believed that Shanghai could not be without such an orchestra, and cultural facilities were especially indispensable. Before there was a way to allow Mr. Dai to hold both positions, the mayor was very troubled. Finally, the mayor resolutely handed the Municipal Symphony Orchestra over to the city's Conservatory of Music for management, and the problem was solved. This is the process before the reorganization.

In Shanghai, where funds are lacking, the orchestra's operating expenses are naturally very small. Through Mr. Dai's efforts, he managed to invite several outstanding musicians from Shanghai to help. Roughly half are Chinese and half are foreigners. Their remuneration is pitifully small, but they know that this is a mission, not a matter of pay.

The performance program this time is as follows:

(1) Overture "Coriolano" by Beethoven

(2) First Suite by Respighi

A. Ballad of Count Orlando
B. Ancient Airs and Dances
C. Masques

(3) Symphony No. 39 by Mozart

A. Adagio—Allegro in E-flat major
B. Andante con moto
C. Menuetto—Allegro
D. Finale—Allegro

(4) Elegy (String Ensemble) by Elgar

(5) Irish Air Selection "Londonderry Air"

(6) Shepherd's Call by Grainger

Conductor: Professor Fu Hua.

Movie Review

### Red Blood Splashed on the White Mountains and Black Waters

— Wubian

Since the "September 18th Incident," the enemy's acts of aggression in the Northeast are truly too numerous to record. To have those of us who have suffered persecution record those aggressive atrocities should be how truthful and profound. However, in "Red Blood Splashed on the White Mountains and Black Waters," the director has brought the audience an empty and illusory story. He did not expose the enemy's sinister rule policies, nor did he depict the painful lives of the people under oppression, but only constructed the center of the story with a love triangle between several young men and women. The male protagonist in the play, Huang Zhigang, is nothing more than an individual hero. He relies on his passionate impulse to assassinate the enemy several times. In fact, in Harbin under the strict rule of the enemy, a person like him could not exist solely on his impulsiveness. The most ridiculous thing is the prison break scene. Two Chinese youths, only having changed into the uniforms of the enemy's military police captain, can rampage and do whatever they want in the enemy's military police team. This is completely below common sense.

Obviously, the director of "Red Blood Splashed on the White Mountains and Black Waters" was influenced by "Casablanca," but compared to the latter, it seems much weaker. In fact, on the Northeast land under enemy rule, countless people's blood is splattered red on the white mountains and black waters. In order to resist the atrocities of aggression, they are fighting fiercely with the enemy. He does not touch these glorious historical facts, but turns around to pick up those love triangle themes, which is very regrettable.

The director Liu Guoquan's handling of the play seems very disorganized. The editing of scenes and shots has irreparable problems. This is the director's misunderstanding and misuse of "montage."

Among the actors, Wei Heling's Huang Zhigang, although without special achievement, has very solid acting skills. Lin Jing's female doctor and Ruan Fei's dancer are too weak. Xiang Kun's Dr. Chen is the best in the whole play. The transformation process after the secret report is a particularly rare gain.

### Chronicle of a Besieged City

— Qin Shouou

When Zhu Zhaonian whistled and pushed open the school gate to walk in, Feifei and Rong'er were playing on the seesaw in the playground; Feifei's face was flushed like a persimmon, and little Rong was covered in sweat.

"You're whistling that tune again! It's not nice! It's not nice!" Feifei shouted at him from afar in a spoiled manner.

Little Rong rolled over, got up from the sand, and ran anxiously and happily to greet him, shouting all the way:

"Uncle Zhu, candy! Candy! Candy!"

At this moment, Old Zhu couldn't linger with them any longer. He casually reached into his pocket, took out two candies for Little Rong, and ran three steps at a time into the big classroom where Lan and the children lived.

Lan was folding clothes that had just been washed and dried.

"There's a glimmer of hope!" Zhu Zhaonian said breathlessly, "It's Jin Aili who helped. The old Zhu guy agreed to take one."

Lan, who was always more composed than anyone else, couldn't help but glance at Old Zhu in astonishment, but she didn't interrupt to ask.

"This is certainly a very difficult thing." Old Zhu also understood her psychology. "But I think with the news so tight, and cars so difficult to find, it's really not easy for you to take two children to escape. It's good to be able to have them take one of them for you. Now the question is, which one should go with them first, Feifei or Little Rong?"

This was indeed a big problem. Zhu Zhaonian had no opinion to offer at all, because he knew too little about Jue Wen's family affairs; Lan, although she was very rational and had her own opinions, couldn't help but have many concerns when faced with such a thing.

In the end, she decided to let Feifei go first in Assistant Zhu's chartered car, because Feifei was older and it would be easier for Jin Aili to take care of her.

Lan began to distribute the luggage, and Old Zhu helped her pack the heavier things; just then, Feifei and Little Rong came in.

"Mom! Are we leaving again today?" Feifei asked eagerly.

"No, you go first alone. Go with Aunt Jin and them!" Lan told her gently.

"What about you?" Feifei was a little confused.

"Your brother and I will leave later because there is no car..."

"No! No! I won't go either! I want to go with you!" She jumped into Lan's arms and hugged her mother's legs tightly. (43)
