### Chairman Encourages the People to Strengthen Themselves; No Need to Fear the Re-emergence of Others; Hu Shi and Others to Visit Japan for Observation After Spring Festival

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 1st] When Chairman Chiang dined with cultural and educational figures such as Hu Shi and Mei Yi-qi in Beiping, he talked about the U.S. occupation policy towards Japan. A certain participant told reporters that the Chairman said that some people in the country believe that the United States is supporting Japan and neglecting China, and therefore worry that Japan will once again form a force to invade China. This view is too extreme. The United States will never do this. The problem is that we must first strengthen ourselves and not fear the re-emergence of others. After the victory, China was generous to Japan. Today, talking about the policy towards Japan is still sincere, hoping that Japan will become a truly democratic country. The Chairman also hopes that Hu Shi and others will go to Japan for observation to help the people understand the Japan issue. Hu and others may go to Japan after the Spring Festival.

### Ministry of Foreign Affairs Statement on the Sino-Burmese Border Issue

Will be Resolved Through Diplomatic Channels

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 1st] The spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs recently stated that due to inconsistent reports in Chinese and Burmese newspapers regarding the Sino-Burmese border demarcation issue, a statement clarifying the position of our government is made as follows: Regarding the Yunnan-Burma border, China and Britain concluded an agreement in March 1894. Except for the section south of Jian Gao Mountain, which has been jointly surveyed by China and Britain, the section north of Jian Gao Mountain is governed by Article 4 of the agreement: "The boundary line of the section north of 25 degrees 35 minutes north latitude will be determined by the two countries after future investigation of the situation there." The section of the boundary line north of 25 degrees 35 minutes north latitude referred to in the treaty text is the section north from Jian Gao Mountain. Although China and Britain have negotiated on this section of the boundary line, they have not reached an agreement. On August 18, 1941, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs proposed to the British Embassy in China to continue discussions on this undetermined boundary line in the spirit of friendship and harmony, so that this long-standing issue can be resolved. On November 17 of the same year, the British Embassy replied: It has been forwarded to the British government and the Burmese government for consideration, and will be forwarded as soon as a reply is received. Subsequently, the Pacific War broke out and Burma fell. The Chinese government did not receive any further replies from the British side regarding this matter. Now that Burma is about to become independent, the Chinese government and people are very gratified. Regarding this undetermined section of the Yunnan-Burma border, it is believed that China and independent Burma, in the spirit of friendship and harmony between the two peoples, and the existing provisions of the treaty, will not be difficult to seek a reasonable, legal, and satisfactory solution through proper diplomatic channels. At this time, any one-sided statements or actions cannot force the other party to consider them valid.

Chairman Wei still maintained an optimistic belief that he would overcome economic fluctuations with an unwavering mentality. During the ceremony, Qiu Nian-tai, Chairman of the Provincial Party Headquarters, and Li Chong-li, a member of the Provincial Council, criticized the distorted reports from foreign newspapers. Councillor's provisional motion: Please request the Central Government to thoroughly negotiate so that Ryukyu is returned to our country. He said: The Ryukyu people's blood, language, culture, customs, and habits are completely different from those of the Japanese. Historically, they have only had relationships of enemies, and no friendly relationships. They were one with China 500 years ago. The King of Ryukyu was captured to Japan before being forcibly occupied. Ryukyu is the northern barrier of Taiwan, an important national defense center, and is closely related to us. It should be returned urgently. The motion was then implemented in enthusiastic applause from the entire audience. The handling of the Peace and Security Office was concentrated and trained, and the banditry was greatly reduced, and the security had been greatly improved. The conference will continue until the 13th.

### Election Results of All Provinces and Cities Must be Reported to the Election Headquarters by the 10th; List of Regional National Assembly Representatives Will be Publicly Announced Tomorrow

[Central News Agency, Nanjing Dispatch, 1st] The National Occupational Women's Election Committee held its 13th meeting at 3 p.m. on the 1st, chaired by Gu Zhenggang. The following was passed: December 3 is the date for the public announcement of the list of elected regional National Assembly representatives and candidates. However, for national occupational women's organizations, the election headquarters will compile the results of the vote count from each county and city election office. The number of votes each candidate receives is reported to the provincial election office for compilation and forwarded to the national election headquarters for a total count to determine the elected and alternate candidates according to law. The deadline for the submission of the vote count results from all provinces and cities has been decided to be December 10. All provinces and cities must compile and report to the headquarters by that date. Failure to do so by the deadline, resulting in the inability to calculate the total, will be the responsibility of the provincial or city election office. The National Assembly election for national occupational women's organizations should be conducted in accordance with the Electoral Recall Law as specified in Article 4, paragraph 1 of the Election Supplementary Regulations. Any places that fail to hold elections on schedule will not be re-elected, so as not to affect the calculation of votes in other provinces and cities in the same area.

[United Press, Nanjing Dispatch, 1st] A government spokesperson stated today that they are currently working hard to ensure that the National Assembly will open as scheduled on December 25. However, if the number of elected representatives from all regions received by the capital at that time is not full, a postponement is almost unavoidable. The Electoral Head Office remains tight-lipped as to when the results of last month's full ballot count will be released. According to well-informed sources, the election process was plagued by irregularities and complaints, resulting in a fairly chaotic situation.

[Our Hefei Dispatch, 1st] The election of regional and occupational group National Assembly representatives in Anhui Province, except for 18 counties where the elections will be held at a later date due to banditry, has been completed on schedule. Currently, only five counties have reported the results of the vote count to the Provincial Election Office. As for the elected National Assembly representatives in the regional aspect, they include Zhang Zhizhong from Chaoxian, Ouyang Lun from Tianchang, Zhao Juemin from Lingshou, Zhao Zhizhong from Guichi, and Chang Fayi from Yingshang. In the occupational groups, Yu Yinning received the most votes in the Chamber of Commerce. Reporters Feng Youzhen and Zhao Junhao received the most votes.

[Our Nanhui Dispatch] The results of the county election have been announced. Jiang Zhuoyun was elected as a regional National Assembly representative with 111,496 votes. As for the National Occupational Group, news reporter Zhao Junhao received 22 votes, traditional Chinese medicine practitioner Chen Cunren 424 votes, lawyer Wang Shanxiang 7 votes, and Chamber of Commerce Lu Xiaobo 470 votes.

### There Will Be Changes to the Organization of the Five Yuan; Legislative Yuan Discusses the Legality of Political Parties, Decides to Refer the Issue to the Next Elective Legislative Yuan

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 1st] The organizational laws of the Five Yuan are currently under review by the Legal Affairs Committee of the Legislative Yuan. The organization of each Yuan will undergo slight changes, such as the addition of a Health Committee to the Legislative Yuan and changes to the Supervisory Envoy Office of the Control Yuan. The small group meeting held on the 1st has not yet yielded results.

[Another dispatch] The State Council previously submitted a proposal to the Legislative Yuan requesting the drafting of regulations. The reason for the proposal is that there are many political parties in our country, but there are no explicit provisions on which are legal. Especially during the general election, there are discrepancies in the nomination of candidates by political parties. Although the State Council made an informal decision that all political parties that participated in the constitution-making process are legal, there are no formal rules to follow. Therefore, the matter was referred to the Legislative Yuan to draft formal regulations. The Legislative Yuan convened a small group meeting on the 1st to discuss the principles of the organization of political groups. It was determined that this regulation is unprecedented in our country and lacks precedent in Europe and the West. It was then decided to refer the matter to the future elected Legislative Yuan for handling. [Another dispatch] The issue of coordinating the quota of legislative committee candidates nominated by political parties was previously discussed at a nine-person group meeting co-hosted by the Kuomintang and the Democratic Youth Party, but no solution was reached. Xu Chuanlin and others from the Democratic Socialist Party took a night train to Shanghai on the 30th to convene a central standing committee meeting for discussion. After deliberation in Beijing, the Youth Party sent a reply to the Kuomintang on the 1st, stating that the original nomination list could no longer be changed. Therefore, the coordination of the legislative committee list is still under study.

[Our dispatch] It is reported that Zhang Junli has been internally designated as the head candidate for the Democratic Socialist Party in this city. The party held a central standing committee meeting yesterday afternoon to discuss the regional distribution of legislative committee candidates. After the meeting, a certain official stated: "The legislative committee is different from the National Assembly. On average, five members can be produced in each district, and up to six in some cases. Among the more than 700 legislative committee members, the Democratic and Youth parties each account for only a small minority of 75. The authorities will eventually find a solution to the regional distribution issue. Therefore, the party's internal discussions today did not intend to make major changes to the original plan. As the results of the National Assembly elections have not yet been officially announced, discussion will be reserved for the time being. As for the technical issue of the proportion of Democratic and Youth Party members participating in the local council, the Youth Party is currently in talks with the Kuomintang Central Committee."

Editorial

### Establishment of the Far East Communist Information Bureau

Following the establishment of the European Information Bureau, the Communist International is also planning to organize an information bureau in the Far East. We received a report from a news agency as early as the middle of last month. According to a United Press dispatch from Hong Kong on November 16th, we already knew that the Communist Parties in various parts of the Far East were preparing to establish an information bureau in the Far East after the European Communist Parties established an information bureau in Belgrade, the capital of Yugoslavia, and were scheduled to convene a meeting in Harbin on November 20th to announce its establishment and issue a declaration. On the 29th of last month, Reuters also reported that the Far East Communist Information Bureau was established in Harbin on November 20th. Representatives from the Communist Parties of the Soviet Union, Outer Mongolia, China, and Korea participated in the establishment meeting. Representatives from the Japanese Communist Party were unable to attend because they did not obtain exit passports. The conference resolved to establish the Far East Communist Information Bureau and to closely cooperate in the struggle for autonomy in various Far Eastern countries, as well as to promote the Communist revolution. According to a United Press dispatch on the same day, the Far East Communist Information Bureau decided to be established in Vladivostok. A report from London on the same day also confirmed the plan of the Communist Parties in various parts of the Far East to convene a meeting to establish an information bureau. Thus, we can know that the Communist International has already convened a meeting in the Far East to establish an information bureau, and plans to promote the Communist revolution in various parts of the Far East and intensify mutual cooperation. Although we have not yet had the opportunity to read the declaration issued by this conference, this declaration is, in fact, not of much significance. We have already seen the declaration of the Communist International establishing the European Information Bureau; the Far East Communist Information Bureau was subsequently established, and the declaration it issued would not be substantially different from the European one. Even if there is a distance, it does not seem to be too far apart. The reason why we have not read this declaration now may be that the Communist International wants to choose a time they consider appropriate to publish it.

We are not surprised by the arrival of this news. When the Communist International established the European Information Bureau in Europe in October, we said that the emergence of the European Communist Information Bureau cannot be said to be a new wall in the international arena, but rather the reappearance of the Communist International. The Communist International has long existed, and its appearance on the international political stage did not begin today. The Communist International's declaration of dissolution in May 1943 was to please Western democratic countries, especially to obtain a large amount of Lend-Lease materials from the United States. Therefore, the Kremlin announced the dissolution of the Communist International, which had been established in the Lenin era, with a piece of announcement. It was nothing more than a set of methods played by Moscow. The international communist movement and the world revolution movement were not affected by the Communist International's declaration of dissolution. Therefore, the appearance of the Communist International in the form of the European Communist Information Bureau is by no means the emergence of a new wall, but an old wall that has already been built, re-hanging its banner and preparing to declare war. Since this is the case, then the fact that the Communist International also appears in the Far East in the form of an information bureau is natural and not surprising.

Due to the establishment of the Far East Communist Party Information Bureau, our country believes that the following points should be pointed out:

First, the Communist Party is an international organization, and the Communist Parties in various places have a consistency in "belief", and the Chinese Communist Party is naturally no exception. In the past, there was a time when the Chinese Communist Party tried its best to win over Britain and the United States, so they themselves thought that they were only a peasant revolutionary party, which was different in nature from the Communist Parties in other countries. This was a distorted propaganda made by them to cover themselves up, but unexpectedly some British and American people believed it to be true and acted as propaganda for the Chinese Communist Party. What is even more regrettable is that some senior diplomats, people who hold the position of ambassador, also echoed the Chinese Communist Party without thinking. Now that the true face of the Communist Party is becoming more and more known to the world, and the Chinese Communist Party has also joined the organization of the Far East Information Bureau, its so-called peasant revolutionary movement can no longer deceive the world. What we want to point out here is that the Chinese Communist Party is a link in the Communist International's promotion of world revolution, and it has no independent existence. The establishment of the Far East Communist Information Bureau further confirms this fact. We want to clearly tell the world not to be poisoned by the Communist Party's propaganda again.

Second, due to the establishment of the Far East Information Bureau and the resolutions passed at the Harbin meeting, we can foresee that the activities of the Communist Party in various parts of the Far East will become more active in the future. In Northeast and North China, the Chinese Communist Party is deliberately sabotaging, and our government cannot but mobilize to suppress the chaos. The same situation may also occur in other parts of the Far East. In Zhao Nan, in the Philippines, in Burma, in Malaya, etc., there are a large number of Communist Party members lurking, and they have actively launched activities in various regions, and may have received a large number of military supplies from the Japanese army. They can choose a time to launch armed struggles in various places in the same way. China has suffered from the disaster of the Communist Party for more than 20 years, and we are familiar with the tricks of the Communist Party. Due to the establishment of the Communist Far East Information Bureau, we must raise the world's vigilance against the Communist Party.

Third, due to the establishment of the Far East Communist Information Bureau, the true face of the Communist International's world revolution is further exposed. This reminds us of our current suppression of the chaos, which seems like our independent resistance against Japan back then, but its hardship is even greater than back then. Back then, we had an obvious foreign enemy, but now our enemy is not as obvious as the Japanese warlords back then; but its harm, because it has an international prospect, is far greater than the Japanese warlords back then. We must raise the awareness of the people of our country about our current enemy, mobilize together, and participate in the suppression of the chaos; on the one hand, we must urge the world to pay attention that in today's world when the Communist Parties in various places are preparing to promote world revolution, only our China is facing our enemy independently, which is also the chaos of the world. We hope that people from all over the world can face up to the world significance of our mobilization to suppress the chaos, and further have new plans and new decisions for the entire world's suppression of the chaos; only in this way can the world's lasting peace be guaranteed.

### The Process of Yin Rugeng's Execution by Shooting

(Continued from page one) At 10:11 AM one morning, supervising prosecutor Wang Wenzhun, accompanied by warden Xu Chongwen and clerk Wu Jingxin, opened a temporary court in the prisoners' workshop near the execution ground. At 10:20 AM, traitor Yin was brought in, wearing a dark blue silk-faced cotton robe, the collar open, blue silk cotton pants, black satin shoes, and a beige velvet-cord melon-skin hat. His face was very plump, but his anxiety was evident in his expression, his complexion was pale, and he was at a loss. After the court inquired about his name, age, and place of origin, it asked him what crime he had committed as usual. Traitor Yin was reluctant to answer. When the court asked if it was the case of a traitor, he hesitated for a long time before saying in a hoarse voice: "Probably!" He seemed to be overwhelmed with shame and regret. Then the court announced: The execution order of the Ministry of Justice has been transferred by the Supreme Court and will be executed immediately. Traitor Yin then sat down to write, and in an attempt to appear calm, he first wrote four lines of the Diamond Sutra: "All conditioned dharmas are like dreams, illusions, bubbles, and shadows, like dew and lightning; thus should you contemplate them." Then he wrote letters to his history teacher, brother, sons, daughters, wives, concubines, and defense lawyer Zhang Shizhao, and his driver Zhang Jigen, a total of seven letters, which took more than half an hour. At this point, traitor Yin asked the executioner to be quick and reduce his pain, and asked to sit quietly and accept the execution so that he could chant Buddhist prayers. At 11:00 AM, the supervising officer ordered him to be taken to the execution ground. Traitor Yin reluctantly asked to talk to the spectators, and in a lecturing manner, he talked about his traitorous philosophy, saying: Although he was sanctioned by national law, he was still sacrificing for the country. Outsiders did not understand and called him a traitor, but in fact, it was not the case. He was stopped by the supervising officer, and as he turned to walk to the prepared stool, a shot entered the back of his head and exited from his left eye. Traitor Yin jumped up and fell down, and turned upward, still not out of breath. After four minutes, the executioner fired another shot to end his life, at 11:12 AM. This old, ugly, and treacherous figure, who combined the crimes of internal rebellion and foreign aggression, came to an end.

### National Federation of Railway Workers' Unions Established, First Congress Inaugurated

"Central News Agency, Nanjing, Dispatch of the 1st" The National Federation of Railway Workers' Unions of the Republic of China, which has been in preparation for more than two years, has now been formally established. At 9:00 a.m. today, the opening ceremony of the first joint representative congress was held at the Nanjing Workers' Welfare Society. Vice Chairman Sun Ke, Minister Chen Chanfu, Minister Gu Zhenggang, Minister Yu Dawei, and Minister Ma Chaojun all attended. Liu Songshan, Chairman of the Congress, delivered an opening speech, stating: The preparation of the Railway Federation began in June of the 34th year (1945) and has taken two and a half years to formally establish. During the later stages of the War of Resistance, the Review Committee organized railway workers to cooperate in combat. After the capital was moved, it led the national employees to cooperate with the general mobilization order, focusing on preventing spies and assisting in suppressing the rebellion. Now that it has been formally established, its mission is even more significant.

Sun Ke's Address Vice Chairman Sun delivered an address, stating in brief: The Railway Federation is established based on the newly promulgated Trade Union Law of May this year. The purpose of the Trade Union Law is to enhance the knowledge of employees, improve technology, promote labor-management coordination, seek employee welfare, and improve work efficiency. He hoped that all railway employees would cooperate with the national mobilization policy, working hard to maintain transportation and seeking their own progress in order to promote social progress and lead the country onto the path of industrialization. In the past, our country lacked trade union organizations, especially national organizations. Today, the establishment of the national Railway Federation is of great significance and marks the initial success of the new Trade Union Law. Among the six major plans in Sun Yat-sen's The International Development of China, four are related to transportation, with railways as the main goal. The importance of the mission borne by the railways is evident here, and he hoped that the mission could be accomplished.

Chen Lifu's Address Minister Chen Lifu, in his address, emphasized the importance of organization and unity, saying: The value of the organization itself lies in strengthening each member through the organization, so that a huge force is generated under the same goal. Workers are the center of revolution and construction, as history has repeatedly proven. He hoped that the Railway Federation employees would strive for their own unity and, in the current stage, through the Railway Federation's organization, assume the task of eliminating counter-revolutionaries.

Gu Zhenggang's Address Minister Gu Zhenggang encouraged employees to actively participate in the work of suppressing the rebellion, earnestly organize the people along the railway, eliminate spies and bandits, maintain a consistent spirit, and do their best to repair the damaged railway. He also encouraged the Railway Federation to strengthen its leadership, participate in the implementation of constitutional government and railway construction, cultivate new cadres, and pay attention to improving work efficiency in trade union organizations, so that trade union organizations become increasingly sound.

Yu Dawei's Remarks Minister Yu Dawei stated: Today's railways are facing some difficulties. Essential railway materials, such as steel rails, sleepers, and communication equipment, are in short supply. The railways are being damaged daily, manpower is insufficient, and the overall railway expenditure is also significantly different. Currently, we can only rely on the hard work of all employees to save the current crisis. In the past year, employees in various regions have shown good performance. He hoped to maintain this spirit and contribute personal sacrifices to seek welfare for 400 million compatriots.

Ma Chaojun's Address Minister Ma Chaojun recounted the history of the railway employees' struggle over the past thirty years and stated: Through the struggle of the past thirty years, we have obtained constitutional guarantees and freedom of participation in government. This fact will defeat the communist bandits' slander and propaganda. He hoped that employees will strive to improve the organizational structure, cultivate a service concept, and make the Railway Federation a true bridge between management and workers, taking on the responsibility of resolving difficulties and disputes. Workers are the foundation of nation-building, and he especially hoped that workers would cherish themselves and others, and not disgrace their position and mission.

The opening ceremony concluded at 12:00 noon. More than 60 trade union representatives attended the ceremony, representing 300,000 railway employees across the country. The establishment of the National Federation of Railway Workers' Unions during the current suppression of the rebellion is truly unprecedented in the history of our country's railways.

"Another Dispatch" The National Federation of Railway Workers' Unions of the Republic of China will hold its first National Congress of Members' Representatives starting from the 1st, lasting for three days. The opening ceremony was held on the morning of the 1st, and proposals were reviewed in the afternoon.

### Rich Gold Deposits in the Dang River Area, Report from the Qaidam Survey Team

"Central News Agency, Lanzhou, Dispatch of the 1st" The area of more than a hundred li stretching across the Qilian Mountains from the Dang River to the Haer River is extremely rich in gold deposits.

The date of handing over the mandate will most likely be announced by Cadogan at the United Nations on Wednesday or Thursday. It is generally believed that the mandate will end in January or February, but political circles believe it should be one to three months later. A Foreign Office spokesman denied that the mandate would end on May 1st.

[Reuters, New York, Dispatch of the 1st] Sir Alexander Cadogan, the chief representative of the British mission to the United Nations, declared today: "I am scheduled to announce on Thursday the definite date of Britain's withdrawal from Palestine. The British Cabinet is currently debating the resolution on the partition of Palestine passed by the General Assembly, and the decision will be communicated to me within 24 hours. I will then formally announce the British government's position to the United Nations organization before Thursday. As far as I know, the withdrawal is scheduled to begin early next month, or about four weeks from now, and there may be no British soldier in Palestine before June 1948." Cadogan also reiterated that the destination of the British troops' withdrawal is Britain itself, not Jordan. He also reaffirmed that Britain will maintain its neutral stance on Palestine, asserting that Britain will not "lift a finger" to implement the partition plan, and that Britain will simply withdraw completely from Palestine. As for how to establish the new countries in the region, that is the business of the United Nations organization. When asked whether Britain would conclude a treaty with the new Jewish state, he replied "of course."

[United Press, New York, Dispatch of the 31st] The partition plan voted on by the United Nations General Assembly last night divides Palestine into three areas: one part is designated as a Jewish state, one part is designated as an Arab state, and a small part near the center, including Jerusalem and Bethlehem, is designated as an international zone. Geographically, Palestine is shaped like a scimitar, with the tip of the blade pointing eastward. The southern part, which occupies about one-third of the entire territory and borders Egypt, will see the Jews gaining most of the inland areas, while the Arabs will gain a narrow strip of land along the coast. The central part of Palestine faces the Dead Sea and the Jordan River in the east, and the Mediterranean Sea in the west. The Jews will gain a narrow coastal strip, including the city of Tel Aviv and the port of Haifa. The Arabs will gain the other parts and the port of Jaffa. In the north, the Jews will gain a narrow strip of land in the east, along the Sea of Tiberias to the Lebanese border, the so-called Galilee in the New Testament. The Arabs will gain the northernmost land, including Nazareth, the birthplace of Jesus.

### Arab People Are Roused to Anger, Tensions Rise in the Middle East, Three-Day General Strike Protests Partition

[United Press, Cairo, Dispatch of the 1st] The Arab Higher Executive Committee today called on the Arabs of the Holy Land to implement a three-day general strike starting tomorrow to protest the United Nations General Assembly's resolution on the partition of Palestine. The committee also demanded that the Arabs step up their boycott of Jewish goods, and that anyone who trades with Jews be considered a traitor. At the same time, the level of riots in the Middle East is intensifying. People in Damascus, Syria, marched in demonstrations and set fire to the U.S. embassy. Clashes also occurred in Palestine, with many Jewish casualties.

[Reuters, London, Dispatch of the 30th] After the news of the UN's passage of the Palestine partition plan spread to the Middle East, the entire Middle East entered a state of tension. It is reported that ten Jews have already been killed in Palestine. The Secretary-General of the Arab League, Azzam Pasha, in Cairo, stated that the partition resolution will ignite the fire in the Near East. Lebanese Prime Minister Solh said in a statement in Baghdad that the Arab League has established a secret decision-making body, and that the Syrian and Lebanese armies are on standby. Iraqi Prime Minister Jabr declared at a press conference in Baghdad that the responsibility of the Arabs lies in saving Palestine. The Arab Committee for the Defense of Palestine, after holding a secret meeting for four hours, stated that now is the time for action, not talk. In Palestine, British troops in Jerusalem have been ordered to remain in their barracks and not go out to prevent incidents. Jews in Tel Aviv, on the other hand, were celebrating wildly. The Irgun, a Jewish underground organization, spoke from its secret radio station in Tel Aviv, declaring that the Irgun would cease to exist within the Jewish state, but also said, "The partition is illegal, and the signature of the Jewish Agency representatives cannot bind the Jewish people. The war to liberate all of Palestine will continue." The Iraqi cabinet met for three hours today, mainly to discuss the immediate implementation of the resolution decided by the Arab League in Bode on 1946, which is said to include a plan for the mass immigration of Arabs into Palestine. At the same time, it is reported that the Lebanese Prime Minister and other leaders were meeting all day in Baghdad with Iraqi leaders, and the telephone lines between Baghdad and Cairo were also very busy. Egyptian students held strikes and other demonstrations, and more than a thousand students from Farouk University in Alexandria sent a telegram to the Arab Higher Executive Committee, expressing their willingness to shed blood for Palestine.

### The Arab Delegation Issues a Solemn Declaration

[Reuters, New York, Dispatch of the 30th] After the UN General Assembly passed the Palestine partition plan, the Arab delegation to the United Nations held a meeting on its own. Afterwards, it issued a statement, stating briefly that the Arab delegation has repeatedly denied that the United Nations General Assembly or any other organization has the right to partition Palestine. They believe that the partition of Palestine case passed by the UN majority has exceeded the power conferred on members of the United Nations by the charter. The Arab delegation solemnly declares that the vote on the case was produced under duress and of course cannot be considered valid.

### We Are Deeply Concerned About the Future Situation in the Middle East

[United Press, Nanjing, Dispatch of the 1st] A certain government official stated today that the National Government is deeply concerned about the future of the Jewish state established by the United Nations General Assembly. Although China sympathizes with the Jews, it announced its abstention when voting on the partition of the Holy Land, because it felt that this plan would cause new riots in the Middle East.

### The Queen of the Netherlands Resumes State Affairs

[United Nations, The Hague, Dispatch of the 1st] Queen Wilhelmina resumed her political affairs today after a six-week recess.

### Unstable Situation in Italy, Prime Minister Asks U.S. Troops to Stay Temporarily, 20,000 Communists Hold Armed Demonstration

[United Press, Rome, Dispatch of the 1st] Government sources revealed on the 1st that due to the instability of the situation in Italy, the United States has decided to keep its troops stationed until the latest hour allowed by the Italian peace treaty. This news coincides with the arrival of the U.S. Mediterranean Fleet in Naples. Observers generally believe that due to the serious threat of communist action, Prime Minister De Gasperi has requested that U.S. troops remain until December 14, the final deadline stipulated in the treaty.

[United Press, Rome, Dispatch of the 30th] Italian Communist Party leader Togliatti published an article in the party newspaper warning the government that any attempt to ban the Communist Party may lead to civil war. At the same time, 20,000 Italian Communist Party members held a military review in Genoa today, which further underscored the significance of Togliatti's warning. The review was presided over by Communist Party Deputy Leader Longo. Labor organizations under Communist Party control in Liguria and other places in northern Italy went on strike to support the armed demonstration in Genoa. In some areas of Rome, non-communist newspapers and factories were looted and destroyed by rioters. Political observers believe that the military demonstration by Communist Party members may immediately accelerate the destructive actions of the Communist Party in various places.

### Molotov Declines Marshall's Invitation to Dinner

[United Press, London, Dispatch of the 30th] It was learned tonight that Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, citing a prior engagement, declined Marshall's invitation to dinner on the 1st. Observers here believe that the significance of Molotov's response may be greater than it appears on the surface. They believe that Molotov's refusal to attend the dinner indicates that Molotov is not yet ready to bargain on the German issue.

### Britain Has No Intention of Suppressing the Activities of the Fascist League

[Reuters, London, Dispatch of the 30th] British Home Secretary Ede declared that the British government has no intention of suppressing the activities of Oswald Mosley, the leader of the British Fascist League, and his allies.

### The Foreign Ministers' Conference Enters Its Second Week, the U.S. Plans to Issue a Statement on the German Plan, the Final Obstacles to the Austrian Treaty Have Not Been Removed

[Our Report] London Broadcast of the 1st: The Foreign Ministers' Conference entered its second week today. Before the start of the conference, French Foreign Minister Bidault told reporters that if the Foreign Ministers' Conference cannot reach an agreement on the future of Germany, then the French-occupied zone of Germany may be merged with the British and American-occupied zones to form a Western United Germany. In addition, according to sources, the Soviet Union has rejected the French proposal for the disposal of German assets in Austria, which is the last obstacle to completing the Austrian treaty.

[United Press, London, Dispatch of the 30th] The Four Foreign Ministers' Conference entered its second week today. The French delegation called on Britain and the United States to strengthen control of the Ruhr area in order to diplomatically offset the Soviet Union's position in eastern Germany.

[Central News Agency, London, United Press Dispatch of the 30th] Marshall plans to issue a most comprehensive statement on the German issue at the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference in the next few days, which will include opinions on German economic unification and the establishment of a national provisional government. It is believed that Marshall's statement will reiterate the American foreign policy that he briefly outlined at the Moscow Four Foreign Ministers' Conference. He will call for the elimination of obstacles that separate the occupied zones, for Germany to achieve economic unification as soon as possible, and then for the organization of a German central government. It is reported that the reason for the delay in Marshall's statement is that the U.S. delegation is divided on the Ruhr industrial area. One faction, led by Dulles, advocates international co-management of the Ruhr, while the other faction, led by Clay, believes that Germans should be allowed to participate in the control of the Ruhr under Allied supervision. This can preserve the prevention of the revival of militarism in all of Germany. According to unconfirmed reports, Marshall seems to agree with Clay's opinion. If so, all of America's foreign policy will change.

### A Draft Resolution from the International Socialist Party Calls on the Four Foreign Ministers to Avoid Splitting Germany

[Reuters, Antwerp, Dispatch of the 30th] The Political Committee of the International Socialist Party Conference recently unanimously passed a draft resolution calling on the four foreign ministers in London to avoid, at all costs, splitting Germany into east and west, so as not to cause a split in Europe and even the world. The resolution also advocated restoring Austria's sovereignty as soon as possible and ending the occupation of the country.

### The U.S. Senate May Pass Aid Bills to France, Italy, and Austria, the House May Include Aid to China

[United Press, Washington, Dispatch of the 30th] The U.S. Senate is scheduled to vote on the $597 million aid bill to France, Italy, and Austria on the 1st. Republican leaders, in addition to launching attacks on Marshall's long-term plan, now all indications are that they will allow the bill to pass. The majority of senators on the Senate committee are now working to restore the $108 million that was attempted to be cut from the aid fund to the three countries. According to informed sources here, although it is not yet known whether the $60 million recommended by the House Foreign Affairs Committee will be changed, the House may pass a resolution to include aid to China in the interim aid bill.

If the original text of the House bill is passed as it is currently drafted, then the House and Senate must convene a joint conference to resolve their differences of opinion. However, it is very likely that the bill will be amended and passed by the Senate, because Congressman Mundt recently stated that the House Foreign Affairs Committee inserted the aid to China case in the bill in order to allow Marshall to use the fund for China if he deems it necessary. However, Mundt said that if the State Department decides that this fund cannot be given to China, then it can be freely used for Europe. Although the two houses seem to be able to take final action on the emergency aid bill this week, what most people are concerned about is still Marshall's long-term plan.

### The Dutch-Indonesian Political Negotiations Are About to Resume

[Central News Agency, Batavia, Dispatch of the 1st] The U.S. transport ship "Renville," which was provided to the Netherlands and Indonesia for political negotiations, will arrive off the coast of Indonesia tomorrow. The negotiations between the Netherlands and Indonesia, which were interrupted in April, are expected to resume on the ship. The Chairman of the Security Council's Commission of Good Offices, Frank Graham, has issued an appeal to the governments and people of the Netherlands and Indonesia, requesting their sincere cooperation in order to quickly resolve the dispute, which has "strategic significance" in terms of time and space.

### Eleanor Roosevelt Arrives in Geneva

[Reuters, Paris, Dispatch of the 30th] Mrs. Roosevelt, who is going to Geneva to chair the United Nations Commission on Human Rights meeting, is scheduled to fly directly from Shannon Airport in Ireland to Geneva today.

### The U.S. State Department Issues a Draft Declaration of Human Rights, Guaranteeing Fundamental Human Freedoms

[United Press, Washington, Dispatch of the 1st] The U.S. State Department announced that Mrs. Roosevelt, the U.S. representative to the United Nations Commission on Human Rights in Geneva, will submit a proposal to the committee, calling on all countries in the world to grant their people extensive freedom of work in the area of human rights, as well as new concepts such as health and social security, as well as the traditional American freedoms of speech, religion, petition, assembly, etc., and the safety of those accused of crimes. The State Department's press release stated, "Although everyone in the world cannot immediately obtain all of these rights, in principle these are the basic rights that everyone should have." Freedom of movement has been opposed by the Soviet Union. When the Geneva Sub-Commission on Racial Discrimination and Minorities voted that freedom of movement should be included in basic human rights, the Soviet Union stated that in the past, capitalist countries mostly used immigration to obtain labor to be exploited.

### General Assembly Concluding Review: Widespread Belief in Expanded US-Soviet Rift

[Reuters, New York, Flushing, 30th] Many UN representatives believe that the recently concluded session of the United Nations General Assembly, while one of the most successful in the UN's history, has also established new areas of dispute. The main achievements of the session include: the establishment of the Balkan Committee to observe the Greek border; the establishment of the Korean Committee to supervise the democratic elections in Korea; the establishment of the "Small Six Committee" to discuss issues that may hinder world peace; and the establishment of the Palestine Committee to supervise the establishment of Jewish and Arab independent states. However, the Soviet and Eastern European bloc countries announced their rejection of the Small Assembly, the Balkan Committee, and the Korean Committee. Therefore, the biggest positive achievement of this General Assembly session is only the decision on the partition of Palestine. However, some representatives believe that there was suspicion of prior consultation during the vote on the plan, which does not increase confidence in the UN organization. Now that the Soviet Union has announced its rejection of the Small Assembly and other organizations, and the Arab countries have announced their rejection of the Palestine Committee, senior UN officials admit that this session of the General Assembly not only failed to bring the United States and the Soviet Union closer, but instead widened the rift.

### French Labor Unrest Escalates: Paris Water, Electricity, and Gas Supply Interrupted; Parliament Postpones Discussion of Emergency Plan

[Report from This Newspaper] London, 1st Broadcast: Paris report, The Labor Confederation, controlled by the Communist Party, issued a statement today declaring that if the Schumann Emergency Powers Bill becomes law in Parliament, the Confederation will never negotiate with the government to resolve the French labor unrest. However, only Communist Party members signed the statement, and other members did not sign, indicating that the labor sector itself has already split.

[United Press, Paris, 1st] As the French National Assembly convened on the 1st to discuss the remaining parts of Prime Minister Schumann's emergency measures plan, Paris's water, electricity, and gas supply were disrupted again due to new strikes, and underground transportation was also in danger of being suspended. Schumann's bill is almost entirely aimed at preventing the Communist Party from controlling trade unions and using strikes as political weapons. It stipulates that those who obstruct workers from going to work will be sentenced to six months to five years in prison and heavy fines. The penalties for sabotage, armed destruction, and attacks on non-striking workers are doubled, and Communist Party newspapers will also be subject to actual control.

The decision-making bureau of the Labor Confederation under Communist Party control is also scheduled to meet today to finally decide whether to yield to Schumann and order the two million strikers to return to work. Some splits seem to have appeared in the Communist labor front, but it is too early to say that this will lead to a betrayal of the Communist Party leadership. Paris underground transportation workers completely stopped working at noon on the 1st. Although buses are still running normally, they cannot cope with the daily flow of four million passengers on the subway. Although the gas workers are on strike, 85 percent of Paris's electricity is supplied by power plants in the provinces, so Paris will not become a completely dark city, but the electricity consumption for industrial use will be sharply reduced.

[Reuters, Paris, 30th] The National Assembly has postponed discussions on the government's anti-strike law. Labor Minister Mayer has negotiated with representatives of the National Confederation of Labor Unions to resolve the labor unrest. At the same time, the government's standing committee has mobilized more troops and police to stand by. Before deciding to postpone the debate, the National Assembly rejected several amendments proposed by the Communist Party to delay the passage of the anti-strike law by a vote of 397 to 144. Then, by a vote of 404 to 184, it passed the first clause of the bill, which authorizes the mobilization of 80,000 reservists to supplement security forces. French Communist leader Thorez returned to Paris from Moscow yesterday. When he entered the National Assembly, Communist Party members cheered him.

[Reuters, Paris, 30th] Incidents of damaging railways in France are endless. On the Geneva-Paris line and the Versailles-Chartres line, damaged railway lines were discovered over the weekend. Fortunately, they were discovered early and no accidents occurred.

### Eastern European Federation Plan: Realization Possible Sooner or Later; Nine-Nation Communist Information Bureau to Meet

[Reuters, Sofia, 30th] The evening newspaper "Bulgarian Capital" reported that Bulgarian Prime Minister Dimitrov recently discussed the plan to organize a federation of Eastern European communist countries with Marshal Stalin in Sochi, Georgia, Soviet Union.

[Reuters, Belgrade, 30th] Responsible officials here stated that they knew nothing about the claim in the London Sunday newspaper that Stalin and Bulgarian Prime Minister Dimitrov discussed the organization of an Eastern European Federation during their recent meeting. One Yugoslav official even dismissed it as baseless talk. However, no one here denied the possibility of organizing an Eastern European Federation sooner or later, but well-informed people do not believe that this federation can be realized in the near future. It is recalled that when Yugoslav Prime Minister Marshal Tito visited Bulgaria, he mentioned the possibility of Yugoslavia and Bulgaria forming a confederation, but said that it was not planned to organize such a union at present. However, he also said that his and Dimitrov's pleasant conversation had laid the foundation for the formation of a federation.

[Reuters, Belgrade, 3rd] Well-informed sources claim that representatives of the first meeting of the Communist Information Bureau of nine countries will gather in Belgrade within days, but the exact date of the meeting is still unknown. It is reported that the Italian Communist Party will send two giants, Agriati and Longo, to participate, and the French Communist Party's representatives will be Deputy Secretary-General of the French Communist Party Duclos and Communist Party member Faillon.

### Marshal Auchinleck: Relinquishes Post, Leaves India for Europe

[Reuters, New Delhi, 30th] Marshal Auchinleck relinquished his position as Supreme Commander of India and Pakistan today and departed for Italy, where he is expected to reside. The British government announced two weeks ago that due to a lack of cooperation between India and Pakistan, Marshal Auchinleck and his staff would withdraw on November 30th.

### Japanese Prime Minister Katayama Accused of Supporting Fascism

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 1st] Following former Prime Minister Hiranuma and Minister Nishio, Prime Minister Katayama has also been accused by a person named Tadatsune Minamikawa to the Tokyo District Public Prosecutors Office. The reason is that Katayama published an essay explaining the National Mobilization Law Bill in the March 1937 issue of "Chuo Koron," but failed to record it on the investigation form submitted to the Central Public Office Eligibility Review Committee. The content of the essay was completely supportive of the National Mobilization Law's fascist tone. Minamikawa is a young man who survived the Kaiten special attack force. Since it is the first time that a prime minister has been accused, the prosecution authorities are taking an extremely cautious attitude in handling the case.

### Japanese Transport Minister Tomabechi Resigns

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 1st] Katayama's Minister of Transport, Yoshizan Tomabechi, submitted his resignation this morning. It is generally believed that after Yoshizan Tomabechi resigns, he will succeed Giichi Takeda as Secretary-General of the Democratic Party.

### Election Supervisory Committee Begins Nominations; Proceeding According to Schedule Until Further Notice; General Assembly Appoints Ballot Counting and Voting Observers

[Report from This Newspaper] The inaugural ceremony of the election meeting of the Supervisory Committee of the Shanghai Municipal Council and the Supervisory Yuan was held solemnly in the auditorium of the Municipal Council at 10:00 a.m. yesterday. Mayor Wu, Speaker Pan, Deputy Speaker Xu, Director Fang of the Municipal Party Headquarters of the Kuomintang, and directors of the Civil Affairs and Finance Bureaus, as well as more than 100 municipal councilors, attended. After the ceremony, Election Supervisor Mayor Wu took his seat, followed by Speaker Pan, who delivered a speech stating that the Constitution of the Republic of China would soon be implemented. According to the Constitution, members of the Supervisory Committee should be elected by provincial and municipal councils. Two members have been designated for this city, and the vote is scheduled for December 7th according to procedure. He emphasized that supervisory power is a very important department in the Constitution, and in order to ensure that supervisory power is exercised appropriately and helps improve administrative efficiency, the selection of supervisory committee members must also be appropriate. Before the election of supervisory committee members, the central government entrusted this important task to the public opinion organs of various provinces and cities, which shows how much the National Assembly valued public opinion organs when it formulated the Constitution.

### Seriously Consider: Appropriate Candidates

Pan metaphorically stated that legislative members are produced in proportion to the population of provinces and cities, which is similar to the form of members of the lower house of the parliament of a country, while supervisory committee members are regulated by administrative regions, with five members produced in each province and two members produced in each city, regardless of population size, which is similar to the establishment of members of the upper house. In short, the election of supervisory committee members is a very solemn matter, so he hoped that all councilors could seriously consider candidates in their minds who could represent the citizens of Shanghai to the central government to exercise supervisory power.

### Election Supervisor Explains Laws

Election Supervisor Mayor Wu continued to explain the relevant election laws and procedures for the city, stating that:
1.  Any resident of the city who has the right to vote under the law and is 35 years of age or older may be elected as a supervisory committee member. The nomination of candidates shall be co-signed by five or more electors.
2.  Those who have resided in the county or city or equivalent district to which they belong outside their place of origin for more than six months or have a residence for more than one year may be elected as a supervisory committee member in the election district even if their place of origin has not changed.
3.  Incumbent officials who participate in the election do not need to resign in advance.
4.  The election method is to circle one person from the list of candidates using an anonymous ballot. Each councilor can only nominate once.
5.  Only one member from each provincial and municipal council can be elected as a supervisory committee member.
6.  After being elected, the supervisory committee members will be notified separately by the election supervisor. They shall indicate in writing within ten days of receiving the notification whether they are willing to be elected. Those who do not indicate within the time limit shall be deemed to be willing to be elected. If they are unwilling to be elected, the person with the next highest number of votes will be elected.

### Voting and Ballot Counting: Completed on the 7th

The Speaker also reported that from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. every day from the 1st to the 4th, councilors will complete the candidate nomination process. At 6:00 p.m. on the 4th, the election supervisor will simultaneously announce the list of candidates at the Municipal Government and the Municipal Council. Voting will take place from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. on the 7th, and the ballot will be absolutely secret. Ballot counting will be held from 6:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. on the 7th. During voting and ballot counting, four observers each will be present to supervise the procedures for councilors to receive and vote ballots and count ballots. The candidates are nominated by the General Assembly to be designated by the Speaker as: Ballot Observers Tong Xingbai, Wang Xianqing, Jiang Huaisu, and Wang Zhuyi; Ballot Counting Observers Xu Yongzuo, Qu Yue, Lao Jingxiu, and Shui Xiangyun. If any of these eight people are nominated as candidates, they will be replaced by others.

### Hu Yang and Chuan Baitao: Most Hopeful for Election

Finally, Mayor Wu added that the city has not yet received an order from the central government to postpone the election of supervisory committee members, so it will still hold a meeting according to law. If the central government orders a postponement, the nomination dates from the 1st to the 4th will not be changed, that is, the nomination will still end on the 4th, and the voting date on the 7th will be postponed. [Another Report] According to inquiries from various councilors by reporters in recent days, most councilors intend to nominate Tao Baichuan as the candidate for the Supervisory Committee, while some intend to nominate Yang Huyu outside the council.

### Regional National Congress Representatives: Officially Announced Tomorrow

[Report from This Newspaper] The review of the election ballots for regional National Congress representatives in the city was not completed last night. According to relevant sources, it will be completed tonight. For the sake of prudence, more time must be taken to ensure accuracy. The official announcement can be made tomorrow.

### Wu Tiecheng Invited Military Training Alumni for Talks at His Residence Yesterday

Wu Tiecheng, Secretary-General of the Central Party Headquarters of the Kuomintang, summoned Li Qilu, Tao Yishan, Zhu Zhenguo, Zhang Xinyu, Ge Mingda, Zhang Shuliang, Gu Zhengyan, and more than a dozen other principal responsible persons of the preparatory committee of the Shanghai School Military Training Alumni Association at his residence on Huashan Road at 4:00 p.m. yesterday, after coming to Shanghai to preside over the second session of the Public Training Alumni Congress. He encouraged the students to help each other and cooperate, and to give full play to the highest spirit of collective training, especially at this time when the War of Resistance has ended and the nation is being built.

### Toothbrush Industry Workers Strike

[Report from This Newspaper] Approximately 100 workers from some toothbrush factories went on strike yesterday. It is understood that the reason was to protest against the party in charge for not complying with the recording. After hearing the news, the Social Bureau sent personnel to mediate, and Xu Mengbiao was responsible for soliciting orders, with the price set at 204,000 yuan per ream. Half of the payment was collected first, and the goods were delivered on [date not provided]. The plaintiff stated that the Central Bookstore needed paper for printing books and was a shareholder. Therefore, it ordered 3,000 reams of paper from the company twice on August 20th and 25th, and paid half of the payment in advance, totaling 300 million yuan. The above payment was personally delivered to the company by Ping, and Zhu personally received it, and Qi signed a contract and issued a receipt as proof. It was unexpectedly found that the goods could not be delivered on time. After repeated urging, it was ineffective. After investigation, it was learned that the newspaper ordered by the company from the Soviet Commercial Counselor had been canceled due to unpaid deposits before the sale, and the Transport Management Committee had never issued any import permits. The half of the payments received from various customers were all used to lure people with a low-priced offer with an invalid order by fraudulent means, causing people to misunderstand and believe. They should be jointly held criminally liable according to the law, and after the first order expired, the defendants knew that they could not deliver the goods. According to the agreement, they settled the price for one part, totaling 359.66 million yuan, and issued two checks from the Xingcheng Bank dated September 23rd, but when they were cashed upon maturity, they were rejected due to overdrafts. After repeated negotiations, only 100 million yuan was repaid. The balance and unsettled costs were ignored, so he filed a complaint requesting that they be punished according to law and ordered to compensate for the loss of 2.696 billion yuan.

### Qin Fen Invites Representatives from Relevant Agencies to Discuss Matters Regarding Receiving Compensation Materials; Inspects Various Warehouses on Site in the Afternoon

[Report from This Newspaper] After Qin Fen, Chairman of the Development Committee under the Compensation Committee, arrived in Shanghai from Beijing, he convened representatives from relevant agencies at the China Merchants Bureau at 8:00 a.m. yesterday to discuss matters regarding receiving the first batch of Japanese compensation materials. The representatives present included Yu Runsheng from the Ministry of National Defense, Xian Baochang from the Ministry of Economic Affairs, Wei Huaiheng from the Ministry of Transportation, Jian Bonang from the Character Committee, Zhou Lungge from the Ministry of Education, and Hu Shiyuan from the China Merchants Bureau, totaling more than 30 people. In the morning, the representatives reported on the preparations of their respective units for receiving compensation materials, including the lease of wharves and warehouses. In the afternoon, Tai Fen led the representatives to Zhanghua Ruqiu River Wharf, Paotaiwan, and other places to inspect the warehouses on site. The results were generally satisfactory, and it was believed that there would be no problem in accommodating the compensation materials after they arrived in the future. The China Merchants Bureau decided to send two large ships to Japan in mid-month to transport the compensation goods. The meeting will continue at 3:00 p.m. today to study the practical technical issues of receiving materials. It is possible to establish a joint agency in Shanghai to coordinate the handling.

### Financial Control Has Achieved Results; All Materials in Shanghai to Be Comprehensively Surveyed

Commander Xuan compared the urgent measures to firefighting. Xuan Tiewu, commander of the Songhu Garrison, met with a Central News Agency reporter in the afternoon of the 1st to implement the "Economic Suppression of Chaos Urgent Measures" and made a statement, saying that the urgent measures are a "firefighting" effort to quickly clean up the current situation of rampant legal tender and soaring prices. Political power will be used to eradicate various artificial maladies and stabilize finances so that prices can be suppressed. The urgent measures are divided into two aspects: financial control and material control. Currently, the implementation is one part of financial control. This work is the responsibility of the Central Bank. The main measures are tightening credit and checking the account books of banks and merchants, which have achieved remarkable results in recent days, and prices have gradually fallen. However, Xuan believes that it has not yet been "100%" achieved. He hopes that the financial authorities will be determined to "sacrifice a few to complete the majority" at this time of "burning the boat". According to the reporter, the detailed measures for the material control part will be implemented after Zhang Jia'ao, president of the Central Bank, brings back some instructions from the highest authorities in Shanghai. The measures include strict government control of various important materials, and a thorough survey of all daily necessities in Shanghai to crack down on national accumulation. The survey work will be carried out by personnel from various agencies, as well as mobilizing military police and students from the city to participate in the form of household registration checks.

### Chongming Captured Criminal Escorted to Shanghai; Dragging Admits Only to Being a "Small Character"

[Report from This Newspaper] The case of a large amount of drugs worth approximately 10 billion yuan being smuggled on a China National Aviation Corporation flight from Kunming to Shanghai is currently under investigation at the District Prosecutor's Office. Shi Qi, a key criminal mechanic in the case, was recently arrested in Chongming (see round). He was escorted to the District Prosecutor's Office by the police bureau yesterday. After being interrogated by Prosecutor Quan Tao, he was detained. Lead engineer Yan Zaihou of the China National Aviation Corporation flight crew was detained and sent to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation on suspicion of drug trafficking. Prosecutor Quan Tao led a group to Longhua Airport late at night on the 14th of last month to arrest the suspected criminals in the case. Four people were arrested at that time, and another key criminal mechanic, Shi Qi, escaped. When [the prosecutors] went to Lujia Yan near the airport to arrest him, Shi had already fled. Because Shi's original籍貫 (registered permanent residence) was Chongming, the District Prosecutor's Office sent a letter to the Municipal Police Bureau requesting that personnel be sent to Chongming to arrest him. It also sent a letter to China National Aviation Corporation, requesting that personnel be sent to the Chongming District Prosecutor's Office to face-to-face deliver an official letter to the chief prosecutor, requesting that personnel be dispatched to assist. As a result of cooperation between the two parties, Shi was finally arrested in the eastern head of Qiaozhen in Chongming.

He was only a small character in the drug trafficking case and denied being the mastermind. There are also five other important criminals in the case, whose names the District Prosecutor's Office refused to announce. It is only known that three of them have been detained. It is heard that several suspected criminals involved will continue to be arrested, and the case will soon become clear.

### A List Causes Resentment: Hong Kong-Shanghai New Air Route Inaugural Flight Invites Hong Kong Press for Test Flight

[Central News Agency] According to sources from Hong Kong news circles: The Hong Kong-Shanghai route of the Hong Kong Airlines, organized by British merchants in Hong Kong, is scheduled to officially commence on the 2nd. The company plans to invite Chinese and Western reporters from Hong Kong to accompany the flight for a test flight and to visit various places in Beijing and Shanghai. The list of invited newspapers originally included the Kuomintang Daily, the Hong Kong Commercial Daily, and the Hong Kong branch of the Central News Agency. However, when the company issued invitations on November 26, there were only four: the English "South China Morning Post", "Hongkong Telegraph", and the Chinese "Wah Kiu Yat Po" and "Sing Tao Daily". This caused dissatisfaction among the entire Chinese press in Hong Kong. Because the invited "Wah Kiu Yat Po" openly collaborated with the enemy during the Anti-Japanese War, and its host, Cen Weixiu, was explicitly wanted by our government. The newspaper has recently defended the communists and slandered our government, so it is still a prohibited illegal newspaper by our government, and the Guangzhou Provisional Headquarters has issued an order in the case. Now, the company is formally inviting representatives of this illegal newspaper to enter our country in high spirits, which is not only an insult to the entire Chinese press in Hong Kong, but also a mockery of our government's explicit orders. Therefore, the Hong Kong press plans to jointly telegraph their counterparts in Shanghai to unanimously criticize them and refuse to host the so-called "Hong Kong Reporters Group" to maintain national integrity. What makes the Hong Kong press even more dissatisfied with the company is that it temporarily canceled the invitations of the Kuomintang Daily, the Hong Kong Commercial Daily, and the Central News Agency branch, which are either opinion agencies closely related to our government or newspapers that support government policies. This action by Hong Kong Airlines fully demonstrates its unfriendly attitude towards our country, so the Hong Kong press has risen up to criticize it and has requested colleagues in Shanghai not to host this group of reporters who cannot represent the Chinese press in Hong Kong.

### Fisheries Syndicate Officially Reopens

### Striking Pilots: No Hope of Reinstatement: Foreign Ships Entering and Exiting the Port: Normalcy Resumed Yesterday

[Our Report] The entry and exit of foreign ships in the city has returned to normal. The twenty-two striking pilots have had their licenses revoked by the customs, and it seems that there is no hope of reinstatement. Although the Chinese pilots of the Tongsha Public Association still refuse to work under the control of the customs, they can directly accept the invitation of shipping companies. The number of White Russian pilots temporarily hired by the customs has increased to ten. They are working very hard because each person must bear the burden of the work equivalent to that of two people before. The person in charge of the Customs Pilot Office told reporters yesterday that no ship that should be exported will not be able to export, and no ship that should be imported will not be able to import, so in fact, it has not been affected by the strike. Based on the general situation, it is speculated that there is only one month left until January 1 of next year, when the customs hands over the pilot management rights, and it is possible that the current situation will continue during this period, and there may be other changes after the Maritime Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of Communications takes over.

### Four Female Criminals Burst Into Tears: Judge Xie Shakes His Head and Sighs: Verdict Announced in Arson Attempt to Burn Down Reformatory

### Statement by the Fuel Control Committee on the Coal Rationing Issue: Profits and Losses All Belong to the National Treasury, With No Profit

[Central News Agency] The person in charge of the Fuel Management Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs issued a written statement regarding the report that "coal is still insufficient, the industrial community suggests reducing the controlled area, and believes that the profit taken by the Fuel Management Committee in the middle is too much": According to the current method, the price of coal purchased by the committee from various controlled mines is approved by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, plus various necessary expenses. The selling price of the distribution to various parties in need is also approved by the Ministry. There is absolutely no profit during the period. Taking the main coal source of Kaiyuan as an example, the December price of the coal

(1) Qinhuangdao delivery price is 1,080,000 yuan per ton, (2) Ship costs: (A) Freight 347,000 yuan, (B) Late fee 40,100 yuan, (C) Pilotage and wharf fees 328,000 yuan, (D) Insurance fee 14,000 yuan, (E) Shortage (omission) 45,500 yuan, (3) Shanghai wharf fee (loading and unloading fee) 141,000 yuan, (4) Business fee: (A) Wharf equipment fee 12,000 yuan, (B) Management fee 11,000 yuan, The above cost per ton is approximately 1.73 million yuan, while the price for public utilities, the largest distribution target, is 1.49 million yuan, with a loss of 240,000 yuan per ton. The price for railways and out-of-town power plants is 1.73 million yuan, which is sold at cost. The price for factories and military agencies varies from 1.46 million yuan to 1.66 million yuan due to the different grades of coal required, which is used to compensate for the losses in public utilities. However, because the amount of coal required by public utilities is very large, the profits obtained from the coal used by factories and military agencies are often insufficient, and the previous government's subsidy system for public utilities and railways, and the current distribution of coal balls to public educators, industrial workers, and occupational workers, etc., cause even greater losses. Although the national treasury bears the burden, even if there is a surplus, it is returned to the national treasury, so the profits and losses all belong to the national treasury, and the committee has no profit to speak of. In addition to controlling Kaiyuan, Huainan in East China, and various mines in Taiwan, all domestic coal is allowed for manufacturers to purchase and transport on their own. The committee does not control domestic white coal, and industry and commerce can freely mine and transport it. The biggest reason for the supply of domestic coal falling short of demand is poor transportation. Regarding this point, the committee's efforts in recent months have not been effective, and the impact on the market is severe. To date, there are more than 600,000 tons of coal in the Kaiyuan area, 560,000 tons in Huainan, and 340,000 tons in East China. Even if coal transportation is opened, I am afraid that the industrial community will not be able to transport it. Therefore, improving transportation, especially railway transportation, is the key to solving the coal shortage.

"Zhang Fei Pushing Zhuge Liang" "Heroes" Busy Back and Forth on the Bridge

[Our Report] The "pushcart heroes" who are active on both sides of the bridges along the Suzhou Creek are one of Shanghai's unique social phenomena. They are a profession outside the three hundred and sixty professions that is protected by gangster forces under difficult social living conditions.

Most Shanghai citizens have had contact with "pushcart heroes," and many are disgusted with their bad behavior. These "heroes" often help the rickshaw pullers push their carts to the top of the bridge by means of "forced execution," regardless of whether the passengers agree or not. Some cunning people simply grab the cart handle and pretend to push, but only heaven knows how much effort they actually put in! When the cart reaches the top of the bridge, they ask the passengers for a reward. The current price is 1,000 national currency. Most passengers take out the money out of disgust and annoyance, perhaps thinking it's no different from getting rid of a beggar. If they happen to not have any small bills, or if some strong-willed passengers are unwilling to pay, the "heroes" will insult them with many vicious words, or grab the cart and push it hard down the slope. In this way, even if the cart does not overturn, the passengers will be scared out of their wits.

### Boss Groups Occupy Territory

Behind these "pushcart heroes" are their systems and territories. Each bridge has one or two old-timer gangster bosses stationed there. We call the pushcart pullers "heroes," but in reality, they are all "minions" under the "bosses." The "bosses" occupy the territory of the bridge, recruit a group of "minions" to do the work of pushing the carts, and collect a fixed daily "tribute" from them. If a "boss" has 20 "minions" under his command, it is estimated that he can earn about 300,000 yuan a day without doing anything himself. Because the benefits are so lucrative, the boundaries between them are very strict. The so-called "river water does not interfere with well water," those on Bridge A cannot push carts on Bridge B, and those on this end of the bridge cannot push carts on the other end of the bridge. Strangers are especially not allowed to intervene. If there are destitute people who don't understand the ways of Shanghai and want to push a cart for some money to buy food, they will be attacked by the group. In this way, before the money for the bread is settled, they will have been beaten enough.

### Gradual Changes in Quality

People in their circles have a "secret language" for this profession, called "Zhang Fei Pushing Zhuge Liang." They regard the passengers on the cart as Zhuge Liang riding in a Kongming cart. Compared with the beggars and bandits who take money and treat the "customers" as "pigs," their behavior seems much better. As for why they compare themselves to Zhang Fei, perhaps they are influenced by the story of Zhang Fei scaring away Cao Cao's soldiers at Changban Slope in the Romance of the Three Kingdoms.

Recently, there have been some changes in the quality of the "bridgehead heroes." Many refugees who fled to Shanghai from the war zones have joined this camp. When reporters observed the bridgehead yesterday, they found that several pushers did not have the aura of gangsters at all. At a glance, it could be seen that they were peasants who had not left the soil for long. I tried to strike up a conversation with a young man in his twenties, and he actually stood still and listened to me respectfully.

### Can Earn 40,000-50,000 Yuan Per Day

He told me that he was a refugee who fled from Anhui. After arriving in Shanghai, he first begged in the city, and then met "the boss" (as he called his gangster "boss gang"), who asked him if he was willing to push carts on the bridge. He thought: Isn't this better than "begging for food"! So he started his bridgehead career. Now he can push carts for about 40,000-50,000 yuan a day, of which he has to "pay tribute" to the boss 15,000 yuan. He has a family of four, and his father is also pushing carts on another bridge.

This is a typical farmer who suffered in China's great land. He sincerely accompanied me in the conversation, which took about the time it took to push a cart. He took out 2,000 yuan from his pocket and gave it to him. He thanked me repeatedly for this meager gift, and then ran away with a smile.

For these pushers who were destroyed by the war before falling to the bridgehead, I don't think we should hate them like we hate the other "pushcart heroes"! However, for the sake of appearance, harmony, and safety, we still hope that the municipal authorities can ban them. If it is not that the authorities tacitly approve of them as a legitimate profession and deliberately condone this group of "heroes" active on the bridges, it seems more appropriate to take them into refugee shelters or reformatories as soon as possible.

Strict Barriers - Outsiders Cannot Intervene - Many Refugees Fleeing the War Zone Join the Ranks

### Dr. Hu Xiansu Arrives in Shanghai, Talks About the Miracle of Chinese Metasequoia, Proves the Ancient Eurasia Was Connected

[Shenzhou News] Dr. Hu Xiansu, a famous Chinese biologist, came to Shanghai last week to raise temporary research funds for the Beiping Jing Sheng Biological Survey Institute. According to what he told reporters: The miracle of Metasequoia, which had survived tens of millions of years ago, was discovered near Wanxian. Dr. Hu said: The true Sequoia, or Redwood, has only two surviving trees in the western United States, which are the tallest, largest, and oldest trees in the world. Chinese Metasequoia is a variant of it, discovered by Professor Wan Jun of the Forest Department of Central University and identified by himself. Paleobotanists have previously discovered fossils of this tree on Sakhalin Island, North America, and Europe, which have many similarities with the American Sequoia. Therefore, after the news of the discovery of Chinese Metasequoia in Wanxian spread, the world botanical community regarded it as the most interesting discovery of this century. Dr. R. Chaney, a professor of botany at the University of California, is very concerned about this. The results of his two exchanges with Dr. Hu prove that Metasequoia thrived extensively on both sides of the Pacific Ocean in the Northern Hemisphere in ancient times. The one discovered in Wanxian is 34 meters high and its circumference can be embraced by several people together. The locals regard it as the tree god and worship it, but its true historical interest lies in proving that the ancient Eurasia was originally related, and the relationship between the Chinese and American Metasequoia can further confirm this point. Later, dozens more trees were discovered in Metasequoia Gully in northern Hubei. The three trees produced in Wanxian have excellent wood quality. The Institute of Biology is currently collecting tree species and will widely plant them and exchange them with foreign countries. This tree is an extremely beautiful ornamental plant.

### Scholarship Unified Review Committee: Yesterday's Standing Committee Decided that Application Forms Already Submitted by Various Schools are Limited to Submission of Various Rosters within Ten Days

[Report from this Newspaper] The Shanghai Scholarship Unified Review Committee held its third standing committee meeting at 3:00 PM yesterday in the conference room of this newspaper. The meeting was chaired by Vice Chairman Mr. Pan Gongzhan. The main points of the report were as follows:

The total amount pledged by various donor groups and organizations was 5,200,712,000 yuan, and the amount of scholarships already issued was 3,333,962,000 yuan. The number of students in colleges and universities who received scholarships this semester was 3,054, and the amount of scholarships already issued was 2,846,000,000 yuan. The number of students in public and private secondary schools who received scholarships this semester was 2,288, and the amount of scholarships already issued was 788,885,000 yuan. Due to the fact that various schools have already submitted application forms but have not submitted the roster of students on public funds or tuition waivers for this semester in accordance with the regulations, the scholarships that should have been issued but have not been issued amount to 462,220,000 yuan. The number of students in private primary schools who received scholarships this semester was 1,336, and the amount of scholarships already issued was 400,090,000 yuan. Due to the fact that various schools have already submitted application forms but have not submitted the roster of students on public funds or tuition waivers for this semester in accordance with the regulations, the scholarships that should have been issued but have not been issued amount to 26,650,000 yuan. After discussion, the following resolutions were passed:

The municipal government will issue scholarships worth 700 million yuan, which the committee will try its best to raise funds to cover. If the funds raised are insufficient, the municipal government is requested to approve the change of the advance payment to a donation.

Since the Youth Corps and the Youth Association have already handled the pledged funds themselves, they should be requested to submit the roster of scholarship recipients to the committee for verification.

The scholarships that should have been issued but have not been issued for this semester should be issued immediately after receiving the donations from Mr. Mei Guohua and Mr. Zhou Xinfang. The remaining amount should be combined with the remaining funds from the former Student Loan Committee for Poor Students and included in the accounts of this committee for distribution.

Secondary and primary schools that have already submitted application forms but have not submitted the roster of students on public funds or tuition waivers for this semester should be requested to submit the roster to the committee before the 10th of this month. Otherwise, the application forms of their students will not be reviewed.

The roster of scholarship recipients for this semester will be temporarily postponed for printing, and a statistical table will be printed and distributed first.

It is decided to convene a joint celebration meeting for all college and university scholarship recipients at 2:00 PM on the 14th of this month at the Municipal Stadium. The Municipal Bureau of Education, the Municipal Stadium, Shen Bao, Xinwen Bao, Da Gong Bao, the Municipal Cultural and Sports Committee, and this committee are requested to be responsible for the preparation. All standing committee members of this committee are requested to serve on the presidium.

Please ask Xinwen Bao to slightly modify the student aid methods.

Since the public-funded treatment of students at the Taxation Vocational School has been certified by letters from the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Education as being the same as that of other national vocational schools, their scholarships will still be approved and issued.

The application for scholarships from the New China College of Law and Commerce for this semester was overdue for too long, and it is difficult to approve and issue them. Please have them apply again next semester.

After the issuance of scholarships for this semester is completed, the committee should request an accountant to audit the accounts and announce the audit results to the public to show prudence. The list of schools that have not submitted the roster is as follows:

Secondary School Section: Qingxin, City West, Yucai, Minli Girls' High School, Weiqing, Jiaotong, Guangcheng, Yaolian, Lixing, Youth Association, Xingwu, Hujiang Girls' High School, Qiude Girls' High School, Chongde Girls' High School, Mingde Girls' High School, Xinmin, Zhongguang, Xingzhong, Boren, Wenhua, Jinye Vocational High School, Zhongguo, Gaohang Vocational High School, Senior Mechanical, Senior Obstetrics, Chengyi, Hongsha, Fenghua, Jianghuai, Zhirenyong Girls' High School, Ci, Lequn, St. John's Affiliated High School, Daren, Jingde, Guangshi, Shandao Girls' High School, Zhongzheng, etc.

### This Week's Group A Soccer: Railway Meets White Eagle, Qingbai Meets Jewish on Sunday at Yiyuan

The third soccer league will continue this week. The soccer committee issued Notification No. 8 last night, announcing that except for Saturday, when there will be no games, on Sunday, starting at 9:00 AM, there will be a total of 14 games in Groups A, B, and C, held at Yiyuan and Zhongzheng Stadiums respectively. The two Group A games will both be held at Yiyuan. At 10:00 AM, Qingbaibai meets Jewish, and starting at 2:30 PM, Railway meets White Eagle.

In the game between Qingbaibai and Jewish, the former is a newly promoted team from Group B. In the friendly match with the strong foreign team White Eagle earlier last month, they fully demonstrated their power. This is their first appearance in Group A, and they should have an even more exciting performance. Jewish has always been known as a dark horse. They easily defeated the Kang team 8-3 in their first battle last week, and their momentum is strong. When they compete with Qingbaibai, in addition to the small yellow-haired Robert Stoff, who is determined to play, the iron gate McNitty also hopes to rush back from Tianjin to participate. The tension is naturally expected.

In the game between Railway and White Eagle, Railway was the champion of the previous Junior Cup, and their strength is evident. However, since Gao Baozhi, Li Yao, Fei Chunhua, Zhang Linggen, Zhang Banglun, and others resigned and left the team, there is no doubt that it will be affected. Although they lost 4-6 to the Malayan Chinese team last month, they also inflicted heavy damage on the visiting team. This time, against the White Eagle, they will definitely try to excel. The full schedule for this week is as follows:

7th (Sunday)

Qingbaibai -- Jewish (Group A) 10:00 AM Yiyuan

Railway -- White Eagle (Group A) 2:30 PM Yiyuan

Gonghexing -- Yangzi (Group C4) 9:00 AM Zhong 1

Huafangji -- Bo Team (Group C1) 9:00 AM Zhong 2

Ji Team -- City Printing (Group C1) 9:00 AM Zhong 3

Railway -- China Airlines (Group B2) 10:30 AM Zhong 1

Kang -- Zhenru (Group B1) 10:30 AM Zhong 2

Beihua -- Silt River (Group C3) 10:30 AM Zhong 3

Far East -- Hongda (Group C2) 1:00 PM Zhong 1

Junior -- Xinshenghe (Group C2) 1:00 PM Zhong 2

Sheng -- Team (Group B1) 2:30 PM Zhong 1

Paramount Jingwu (Group B2) 2:30 PM Zhong 2

Lisen -- Baoxing (Group C4) 2:30 PM Zhong 2

### Grand Occasion of the Lianghuai Autumn Games: Huaihai Men and Women Youth Excited and Enthusiastic

[Report from our correspondent in Huaiyin] The sports scene in northern Jiangsu has always been backward, not to mention that it has gone through ten years of chaos. We stand on this point of view to look at this Lianghuai Autumn Games, which caused a sensation in the Huaihai area. In today's northern Jiangsu, where the rebellion has not been quelled and the flames of war are everywhere, we feel that it is of profound significance.

As early as this summer, when the Huaihai Pacification Zone Headquarters was organizing the "Youth Summer Camp," Commander Zhang Xuezhong began to have the motivation to hold a sports meeting. After several months of preparation, this meaningful program was inaugurated on the birthday of the Premier, under the bright sunshine, and amidst the cheers of thousands of Huaihai youth.

First of all, we should understand that under the restrictions of various conditions, we do not need to place too high hopes on the results of various events. However, what we should pay attention to is the enthusiastic mood of the various athletes. Many athletes from the counties rushed to participate despite the difficulties and dangers of unsafe transportation.

In the conference, we can find many excellent athletes. From them, we can prove that the sports world in northern Jiangsu still has its future. There is a fifteen-year-old student in Huaiyin County. He is a mixed race of Chinese and French. He participated in the pole vault. Although he was ranked second due to lack of physical strength, his posture, his correct and relaxed movements, were unmatched by any other athlete. In addition, Miss Zhao Li of Jiangsu Provincial Huai'an Middle School and Miss Cui Yang of Zhicheng Girls' School in Zhunyin monopolized most of the championships in the girls' group in high jump, long jump, softball, discus... and other track and field events, and became the focus of attention of the entire venue.

The conference lasted for four days. Watched by thousands of pairs of eyes, it closed on the 14th. The cheers and jumps of the youth for four days have already solidified the hearts of thousands of athletes in Huaihai.

### Economic Suppression Measures to be Implemented Soon: Commodity Prices in this City Generally Decline: Rumor that Cadres will be Assigned to Establish Control Institutions

[Report from this Newspaper] In recent days, there have been frequent rumors that the central authorities will implement urgent measures to suppress economic chaos within the year and will set up institutions to control finance and materials in this city, so that commodity prices can be regulated for a long time. As a result of the rumors, commodity prices in this city generally began to fall this morning, resulting in a drop of about 10% compared to the end of last week. In the afternoon, due to the easing of monetary policy, there was a slight recovery.

In terms of Hua shares, each share once fell to the daily limit in the morning. Yongsao once fell to 322 yuan. In the afternoon, it recovered to 362 yuan. Twenty-one Zhibian Mazis fell from 31.3 million yuan to 27.5 million yuan. In the afternoon, it recovered by more than one million yuan. Forty-two blue shares fell from 50.5 million yuan to 46 million yuan, and recovered by about two million yuan in the afternoon. Various grades of cotton fell by about 10%. White japonica rice fell by 30,000 yuan. Flour fell by 10,000 to 15,000 yuan. Crude oil and soybean oil also fell by 200,000 to 300,000 yuan. Other items such as cigarettes, soap, and candles also generally fell by 10%.

General observations are that if the authorities can issue urgent measures to suppress economic chaos and set up control institutions, assign cadres, and thoroughly implement the responsibilities, and cooperate with the national banking bureau's loan release and monetary policy contraction policies, commodity prices are expected to no longer fluctuate within the year.

[Another Report] Since the news that the government will implement urgent measures to suppress economic chaos in Shanghai and set up economic suppression institutions has been revealed, stock commodity prices showed an overall decline yesterday (1st). A reporter from the Central News Agency visited the person in charge of the national bank to inquire about the situation. According to the person, the bank has not yet received any orders for the above plan. As for setting up another institution, it is still unknown. President Zhang is still in Beijing on official business and there is no news of leaving Beijing tonight. Once Zhang returns to Shanghai, the content will be clear. The person in charge analyzed the past price surge and the internal factors of the current decline, saying that the recent price fluctuations were mainly caused by the rise in gold, banknotes, yarn, and cloth. This decline was also caused by the sharp drop in these items. According to the survey, the market price of gold and banknotes fell by about 10% on the 1st, which is about 30% lower than the peak; the Yarn and Cloth Association announced that it would decide to implement a joint distribution system in the shortest possible time, and the association entrusted the Textile Construction Company to sell as much as possible on the market in order to adapt to the urgent measures. Market prices also fell by more than 10%, which is 20% lower than the peak. Furthermore, according to past gold and banknote transactions, actual transactions were rare, and the supply and demand were uneven, creating an abnormal psychological effect. This decline is a natural trend of psychological circulation. Shanghai is a speculative market, and people's hearts are fluctuating. This can be used as a head-on blow to speculators. In addition, measures such as the National Banking Bureau and provincial and municipal banks stopping loans, and restrictions on remittances coming to Shanghai from various places are all effective measures to tighten monetary policy. Furthermore, the National Bank is still continuing to inspect bank holdings. Regarding the clause that bills cannot be used on the same day, before the new method is promulgated, the National Bank will strictly implement the previous order of the Ministry of Finance, and they must not be used on the same day. Tightening monetary policy has already had an effect on suppressing prices, and the National Bank will continue to carry out the policy on the 2nd. The person in charge expressed absolute optimism about the future stability of commodity prices. He continued to say that in the future, the handling of materials brought to port with self-provided foreign exchange, the successive arrival of Sino-American relief materials, and the success of American loans, the government's control of a large number of materials, and various factors will all be beneficial to the future of commodity prices. It will not be difficult to clear up the shadow of speculation.

### People are Extremely Panicked, Hua Shares Fall Sharply

Yesterday's shares changed quite a bit. Initially, people were extremely uneasy and fell sharply in the middle of the day. Yongsao, Meiya, and Xinhuo fell to the limit. Powerful groups took advantage of the low prices to supplement their positions outside the market, and the National Bank stepped in again, and then rebounded sharply after falling.

No. 54 and others maintained it at low prices, and No. 117 and others immediately delivered. It rebounded to 330 yuan and 338 yuan near the closing. No. 98 sold off immediately, and No. 173 and others delivered in stages. The afternoon close still retreated to 328 yuan and 333 yuan. The spot delivery Xinhuo also fell to the limit and then recovered slightly. As a result, compared with last Saturday, the spot delivery shares Yongsao, Meiya, and Xinhuo fell to the limit and then recovered, and Huaxin, Zhongfang, Rongfeng, Tongyi, Zhongsi, Match, Wuhe, Yonggong Underwear, and Xinhua each fell by about 10%.

The market was still weak, and Meiya was placed on hold by No. 27. No. 223 and others sold for deferred delivery, and No. 226 and others sold for immediate delivery. Yongsao also announced that it would fall to the limit. The difference between the current delivery and the deferred delivery was too great, and there were many arbitrageurs, and the deferred delivery was even traded at 332 yuan, which was lower than the limit. No. 155 and others scrambled to make up for immediate delivery, and No. 65 and others immediately delivered. At first, it was rumored that the National Bank was only short of more than 10 billion and rose to 344 yuan and 353 yuan, and No. 84 and others sold immediately, and No. 160 and others sold for deferred delivery, falling to 340 yuan and 355 yuan. The National Bank issued 17 billion, No. 4 and others immediately rebounded, and then there was a rebound. It was rumored outside the market that the Beijing gang was buying 700 million shares, and people's hearts were greatly improved, and the price rose to a high price of 358 yuan and 365 yuan. No. 32 and others still sold at high prices, and the closing price was 356 yuan and 360 yuan. As a result, compared with the morning close, the spot delivery shares Xinguang and Jingfu rose by 10%, and Huaxin, Yongsao, Rongfeng, Xinhuo, Tongyi, Zhongsi, Huafeng, and China-France rose by 0.5%, and the rest rose slightly. Among the deferred delivery shares, Huafeng rose slightly, and Yongsao, Xinhuo, Meiya, and Qinxing rose by slightly more than 0.5%. Xinguang and Jingfu rose by slightly less than 10%. The old shares outside the market all fell back.

The capital increase of Lian An Department Store has been completed, and the new shares are scheduled to be listed before the market opens on Thursday, December 4th. The transaction unit is temporarily set at 100,000 shares.

### Rice Continues to Decline, Coarse Grains and Oil Market Weakens Again

Yesterday, a total of about 31,000 piculs of rice and grains arrived in the north and south markets. Due to the decline in all commodities, the source of arrival was strong, and the digestion was weak, the market situation continued to decline. Japonica rice continued to fall by 120,000 yuan, indica rice fell by more than 10,000 yuan, and white yuan middle grade also fell by 120,000 yuan. Under the cloud of flour volatility, it continued to fall by more than 10,000 yuan, and bran was also less favored, falling by more than 10,000 yuan.

Yellow beans were quietly used and continued to fall by 230,000 yuan, and the oil mill was still.

### Unified Bonds and Foreign Shares Fell

Public bonds also fell yesterday, with a transaction volume of only 4 million. The unified C opened at 23,200 yuan, fell to 22,200 yuan, and then leveled off slightly. As a result, compared with last Saturday, A and B fell by 1,000 yuan, C fell by 1,700 yuan, D fell by 830 yuan, and the unified E also fell slightly by 1,200 yuan.

Foreign shares were in a sluggish situation in various industries yesterday, and also fell back. Retail investors bought slightly, while bank gangs, securities gangs, and foreign firm gangs supplied. Yisha opened at 330,000 yuan, once fell to 298,000 yuan, and then struggled to rise back to around 325,000 yuan. Hong Kong Shen Electric Telegraph rose to 3.9 yuan.

Woolen Fabrics are Stable

Yesterday, woolen fabrics were quite popular. Floral wool, tweed, serge, Huarong ne Xuanwei, overcoat ne Pinghou ne, Mai Erden uniform ne, and other retail transactions were extremely prosperous. Men's and women's clothing stores on Hubei Road, Linsen Road, and Nanjing Road are now doing good business in clothes. The association with Qi Street gang is also busy. There are more buyers than sellers at the Changle Teahouse. Although the market is still stable tomorrow, it is secretly showing a slight increase.

### National Bank Strictly Restricts the Use of Bills on the Same Day

It is reported that before the new method of restricting the use of bills on the same day has been promulgated, the National Bank will strictly implement the previous order of the Ministry of Finance in order to thoroughly implement urgent measures to suppress economic chaos, eliminate speculative merchants who are making waves, stabilize finance, and improve people's livelihood.

### US Treasury Bill Allocation is Based on Last Month's Balance

[Report from this Newspaper] The second phase of the US dollar short-term treasury bills for the 36th year began to be sold on October 1st. As of the end of November, a total of US$2,115,050 was sold nationwide, including US$380. The allocation amount for December has been stipulated by the Ministry of Finance. It is temporarily based on the balance of the November allocation that has not yet been sold, and will be adjusted appropriately later depending on the fundraising situation.

### Multiple Longs Express Scarcity of Transactions: Gauze and Cloth Sold Off Amidst Cries; Spot Cotton Prices Plunge Due to Supply Exceeding Demand

Yesterday's cotton yarn market was sluggish due to tight credit and the concurrent opening sales of spinning mills under construction.  Many longs unwound their positions, leading to widespread sell-offs and a steady decline in prices.  Eventually, the 42-count Blue Wind fine yarn fell below the 50 million mark, reaching a low of 46 million yuan, a sharp drop of 4.5 million yuan per bale compared to the closing price of the weekend. Other yarns, both coarse and fine, also experienced significant declines of 2 to 3 million yuan.

Yesterday's cotton cloth market saw major players offloading their holdings due to various factors unfavorable to buyers, causing a sharp decline in market prices. As a result, various grades of fine cloth, including 12-pound Dragon Head, experienced a uniform and drastic drop of 110,000 to 120,000 yuan compared to the closing price last Saturday.  Drill, twill, poplin, Yuan-chih tribute cloth, and Yuan-quality satin all fell by around 100,000 yuan. Only 190 Schappe cloth and colored cloth maintained a relatively firm market tone.

Yesterday's spot cotton market was weak due to the sluggish yarn and cloth markets, resulting in extremely low confidence. The tight credit situation further exacerbated the issue, leading to a supply exceeding demand. Prices plunged sharply, transactions stalled, and very little business was conducted, with only 150 bales changing hands.

A Glimpse of Opinions on the Control of Yarn and Cloth

[Report from this newspaper] Yesterday, a reporter briefly inquired about the rumored comprehensive control of cotton yarn and cloth by the authorities, consulting Mr. Wang Qiyu, the chairman of the Cotton Spinning Association in District Six. Mr. Wang stated that if the government could consider the production costs of spinning mills and resolve the issue of raw material funding, preventing mills from ceasing or reducing production, then the spinning mills should sincerely cooperate given the current national crisis. However, the business strategies of various private spinning mills may differ, and his personal opinion may not represent the views of all private spinning mills.

### Transportation Difficulties Increase Costs: Fuel Control Committee Adjusts Coal Prices; Roughly a 40% Increase Compared to November

[Report from this newspaper] Yesterday, the person in charge of the Fuel Control Committee released a statement regarding the committee's adjustment of coal allocation prices and costs for the current month: The prices at which the committee purchases coal from various controlled mines are all approved by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, with the addition of various necessary expenses for allocation to various parties. The selling price is also set by the ministry, and there is absolutely no profit to be made.

Besides controlling the Kai-luan, Huainan in East China, and Taiwan mines, the committee allows manufacturers to purchase and transport all domestic coal on their own. The committee does not control domestic white coal at all, and businesses are free to procure it. The greatest reason for the supply of domestic coal not meeting demand is the lack of smooth transportation. Despite several months of effort, the committee has not yet seen results in this area. For example, the railway section from Jiaozuo to Xinxiang is damaged, and despite repeated consultations with the Ministries of National Defense and Communications to rush repairs, there is still no concrete solution. The shortage of vehicles on the Beining Railway and the southern section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway, coupled with frequent military use, has a significant impact on coal transportation. As of now, the Kai-luan mining area has a stockpile of over 600,000 tons of coal, Huainan has 50,000 to 60,000 tons, and East China has 30,000 to 40,000 tons. Even if the coal supply is opened up, it is feared that industry will not have the capacity to transport it. Therefore, improving transportation, especially railway transportation, is the key to resolving the coal shortage.

The adjusted prices for coal allocation in December are as follows: A. Public utilities: 1.5 million yuan. B. Railways, military transportation, and navy: 1.73 million yuan. C. Power plants, steamships, and transportation institutions in other cities: graded pricing, ranging from 1.73 million yuan to 2.12 million yuan. D. Factories and military/government agencies: graded pricing, ranging from 2.17 million yuan to 2.59 million yuan. E. The allocation price for foreign coal and white coal will be approximately 40% higher than the November allocation price.

### Applications to the Transport Control Committee for Acquisition and Return of Imports

[Report from this newspaper] It has been learned that, from November 23rd to 29th, importers applied to the quota allocation office of the Transport Control Committee to have approved imports acquired. These included over US$19,000 worth of chemical products, over US$1,000 worth of rubber, over US$1,000 worth of oils and waxes, over US$38,000 worth of paper and wood pulp, US$800 worth of pharmaceuticals, and over US$23,000 worth of timber, totaling twelve applications. From November 16th to 22nd, there were fourteen applications totaling over US$148,100. As of the 29th, over 180 applications were made to the non-quota allocation office for import licenses for goods under Schedule One, with 121 applications approved. As of the 29th, there were two applications to acquire goods under Schedule Three A. As for requests to return goods to their origin for re-export, there were as many as 513 applications.

### Tight Credit

[Report from this newspaper] Credit in the city was extremely tight yesterday morning. The shadow interest rate briefly hovered around 2.5%, but eased slightly in the afternoon, with the shadow interest rate dropping back to 2.2%. Interest-bearing Huagu shares ranged from 2.3% to 2.75%. The net shortfall of national banks was 17 billion yuan. It is expected that credit will be tight today because national banks will have a large settlement of cotton yarn and food. Yesterday, the joint reserve of the silver dollar industry released about 8 to 900 million yuan of funds, and the silver dollar industry and the Sino-American Bank remained relatively stable. Among the national banks, the Central Bank had a shortfall of 47.4 billion yuan, the China Farmers Bank had a surplus of 17.4 billion yuan, the China Trust Bureau had a surplus of 57.8 billion yuan, and other banks had no major inflows or outflows. In addition, major clearing houses had 81.9 billion yuan inflow, foreign banks had 43.2 billion yuan inflow, and small clearing houses had 108.1 billion yuan outflow.

### Rayon Plummets

Rayon prices plummeted yesterday morning, falling approximately 10 million yuan lower than the previous weekend, and rebounded slightly in the afternoon, ultimately ending down 10 million yuan from the previous weekend's figure. 120-count Asahi glossy yarn opened at 102 million yuan, but attracted little interest, steadily declining to a low of 95 million yuan before recovering to 96.5 million yuan for spot transactions. 4A grade goods traded at 91 million yuan. Sentiment improved slightly in the afternoon, rising to a selling price of 90 million yuan, with final transactions occurring at 101 million yuan.

### Commercial Briefs

The cigarette market yesterday saw a considerable number of transactions at the opening, but prices declined due to the sharp fall in various non-industry commodities. As a result, 10-pack Great Britain Old Knife brand and Liang cigarettes continued to drop 900,000 to 1.15 million yuan compared to the previous day.

In the market for daily necessities, market sentiment declined. The prices of Solid Base and Scissor brand soaps continued to decrease by 20,000 yuan, while Beautiful Phoenix matches experienced a minor drop of over 10,000 yuan. Kerosene and candles remained firm.

Yesterday's timber market saw weak sentiment. Fir wood prices fell from the earlier price increase, and Western pine prices also became unsustainable.

Xuejin Weekly

### Inaugural Statement

— Zhang Qixun

The name "Xuejin Weekly" (學津周刊) literally means "academic ferry." This publication hopes to serve as a bridge connecting universities and society. The editors of this publication are all currently teaching at universities, covering fields in humanities, social sciences, and natural sciences. Generally speaking, the humanities aim to understand oneself, the social sciences to understand others, and the natural sciences to understand the universe. Only by knowing oneself, others, and the universe can one achieve comprehensive self-cultivation. This is the common meaning of modern university education and also the purpose of this publication.

Freedom is the foundation of democracy. Everyone has freedom, but this does not mean that everyone can be selfish and self-serving. Every free person should have a sense of responsibility, be loyal to the truth and to the community, and be open-minded and discerning towards the views of others. The spirit of freedom is, in fact, the scientific spirit of seeking truth from facts, emphasizing observation, valuing experience, respecting facts, trusting evidence, making systematic rather than deductive reasoning, and forming objective judgments. Cultivating this kind of mental habit is the core issue of civic education in a democratic country. "Knowing the importance of tolerance without falling into nihilism, knowing the importance of faith without falling into dogmatism, knowing the importance of criticism without falling into cynical misanthropy." This is what a free society depends on. Today, the psychological basis of our national construction also encompasses these key points.

Today is the atomic age. The flames of Hiroshima, Japan, will forever leave a solemn lesson in people's minds. Modern problems are all deeply influenced by science and technology. The value of science lies in its method. The scientific method is a tool for overcoming prejudice and eliminating misunderstandings. Both fearing science and worshiping science are mistakes. What is needed now is to understand science. We should integrate theoretical and practical knowledge, technology, and concepts in science, and through public opinion, enable the general public to understand them. Only in this way can modern culture be safe and sound.

However, science cannot represent all academics. Science must be complemented by the humanities. The humanities include philosophy, history, literature, and art. Their difference from science lies in the fact that science only asks for causes, not purposes; only asks for parts, not the whole. The humanities compensate for what science cannot reach. Scientific humanism is most needed in the modern world. Humanism originated in ancient times. Ancient Chinese culture and Greek culture both emphasized the character of the gentleman and regarded it as the standard for humanistic cultivation. However, modern humanists must understand scientific methods and the scientific spirit and keep pace with the times. Therefore, it is also called scientific new humanism. This publication is named "Xuejin" (學津), hoping to work hard to culturalize science.

### The Division Between Ancient and Modern Science

— Chen Li

From a sociological point of view, science is the embodiment of the spirit of the age (Zeitgeist). Since science cannot transcend the background of the times, modern science and ancient science must have some differences in viewpoints or purposes due to the different eras, not to mention the vast difference in their achievements. This article aims to outline some of the important differences.

First, ancient science emphasized the ultimate nature of things. Chinese Yin-Yang and Five Elements theory and the ancient Greek atomic theory, such as Empedocles' water, fire, earth, and air, were all used to explain the ultimate nature of all things. Aristotle defined physics as "the inquiry into the nature of things," and we especially value the term "nature." Nature can obviously be analyzed into two points: one is origin (Origin), and the other is essence (Essence). The Greeks, like the philosophers of the Qin and Han dynasties, easily involved the origin of the universe when discussing nature. When we read their descriptions of the initial chaos, "In the beginning was an indefinite incoherent homogeneity," we naturally associate them with the Chinese philosophers, such as the "Astronomical Training" chapter of the Huainanzi:

"Before heaven and earth took shape, there was a boundless and indistinct state, hence called Tai Shi (太始). Tai Shi produced emptiness (虛　), emptiness produced the universe, and the universe produced primordial Qi (元氣). Primordial Qi had boundaries. The clear and light (淸陽) dispersed and became heaven, while the heavy and turbid (重濁) congealed and became earth. The combination of the clear and light was easy, while the congealing of the heavy and turbid was difficult. Therefore, heaven was formed first and earth was established later..."

We may feel confused by this evolutionary view regarding the ancient science's emphasis on essence. The basic characteristic of essence is immutability, so how could ancient science produce the theory of evolution? Unless we see this point clearly, it is difficult for us to understand the fundamental differences between ancient and modern science in their views on evolution.

Take the above-quoted Huainanzi as an example. How did heaven and earth evolve? This is because Qi has principles and paths, and there are clear and turbid elements. The heavy and turbid congealed downwards to form the earth, while the light and clear floated upwards to form the heaven. The reason for evolution lies in the essence of things. Not only is the result of evolution determined by the essence of things, but also the order of the stages. "The combination of the clear and light was easy, while the congealing of the heavy and turbid was difficult. Therefore, heaven was formed first and earth was established later." The order of priority is obviously determined by the nature of things. Therefore, if one can understand the nature of matter, the phenomena between heaven and earth can be easily traced back like following a map.

Since the process of all phenomena can be deduced from the nature of things, deductive reasoning occupied an extremely high position in ancient science. Plato regarded geometry as the queen of all sciences because geometry is purely deductive. Since "the trend is inevitable and the principle is inherent," observation is unnecessary, or at least secondary, and experimentation is even less important. Since everything can be deduced, why should we be concerned with the evidence before our eyes? "The knowledge of the ears and eyes is limited," and experience becomes a burden to "innate knowledge." For example, a straight line, the straight line in experience, is neither straight nor a line, and often becomes an obstacle to reasoning. Another reason why geometry was admired by the Greeks was because they believed that geometric reasoning did not rely on the observations of the ears and eyes. This kind of not relying on observation, not relying on experience, and relying solely on innate knowledge is the most different point between ancient science and today's science. Because there is no need for empirical evidence, ancient science began by discussing the state of affairs at the time of "the opening of chaos." Modern people like to say that this is today's theory of evolution. In fact, this has nothing to do with the modern theory of evolution. Why? Because this kind of evolution is completely based on reasoning and not on facts. In the world of myriad phenomena, we can extract several identical essences. From these essences, we can extract more original essences, the so-called "to differentiate further, the more differentiated it becomes, until there is no differentiation, and then it stops" (Xunzi, "Rectification of Names"). From the particular to the general, from the general to the "formless" prototype or the infinite behind it. This kind of reasoning from complex to simple can originate from pure logical deduction, that is, the connotation shrinks day by day, the extension expands day by day, reaching the peak, the connotation approaches zero, even the forms are gone, and the extension encompasses everything. The result of this kind of reasoning is naturally simpler the further it goes, which is similar to the modern theory of evolution in form. But in spirit, the two are completely opposite and should not be forced into one discussion.

The focus of modern science is not the essence of things, but the relationship between things. This can be clearly seen from Galileo's experiment on falling weights. Aristotle's viewpoint is essential, so he said that objects have weight, and heavier objects fall faster than lighter objects. But Galileo believed that the difference in falling speed has nothing to do with essence. Regardless of weight or size, objects should fall at the same speed. The difference is due to the environment. In modern science education, middle school physics experiments use a feather and a coin falling together in a vacuum glass tube, and we see that they both fall at the same time. In other words, the difference in the speed of the falling phenomenon is not due to the lightness or heaviness of the essence, making "the heavy must be fast, and the light must be slow." Rather, it is due to the relationship of the environment, the resistance of the air, that the feather and the coin show different speeds when falling.

Now let's turn back to discuss the theory of evolution in modern science. Darwin's theory of evolution does not assume that species have an internal essence that must change, but rather as a result of adapting to the environment. The so-called "survival of the fittest," "survival" refers to the relationship between organisms, and "fittest" refers to the relationship between organisms and the natural environment. In short, the focus is on relationship and not on essence. This major shift in perspective has sparked a thorough revolution in science, with observation and experiment replacing formal reasoning, and static logic turning to dynamic logic.

Since past science emphasized essence, taxonomy was the key to academic methods. Because if a person knows that something belongs to a certain category or race, we can infer its necessary attributes from the nature of its category or race. Just knowing that Confucius is a human being, we know that Confucius must die, because death is an attribute of human beings. Although the author argued above that ancient science did not rely on observation, ancient science did not completely abandon observation. For example, Aristotle did some observational work. Classification often requires observation, but observation only goes as far as classification. Everything after that is in deduction. The so-called change is also the same. Ancient science did not ignore change, but its so-called change was only the unfolding of essence, like the gradual unfolding of a painting to reach a complete state. For example, a child is a human being and has human attributes, so he must develop into an adult. His development is determined by his essence, we only need to know that he is a human being. Although this view does not reject the concept of change, the viewpoint is static. His coming development has long been hidden in the beginning's "clue." Therefore, the ancient science's theory of evolution is conservative and predetermined.

The modern science's theory of evolution is completely different. It does not tend to a predetermined prototype. The mutual relationship between things determines its destiny path. Therefore, we cannot predict its destination solely from its essence. We have to observe, because relationships are infinite, so observation is endless. For example, although 26 letters (essence) are known, the combination and transformation (relationship) of 26 letters is endless. One cannot infer the meaning of the word spelled out from 26 letters. Each spelling has a new meaning, so each relationship must be re-observed. The viewpoint of the new science is dynamic, and the change is endless. Because of this, the current science emphasizes experimentation. The essence of experimentation is to change conditions (that is, the mutual relationship between environment and essence) to observe, that is, to observe its changes, rather than to observe its constants. Experimentation is about observing how it is under certain conditions, how it changes under different conditions, and how it changes under other conditions. Observation is the center of modern science, unlike ancient science which only used it to determine the premise. The conclusions of the current science must still be confirmed by observation. This is perhaps the most obvious boundary between the current and ancient science. How modern evolutionary theory strives to find the so-called "Missing Link" is obviously completely different from the complete system of ancient evolutionary theory.

Unless we understand the position of the experimental method in modern science, it is difficult for us to appreciate the basic differences between ancient and modern science. Ancient science had observation but no experimentation, because ancient science valued essence, so sometimes it had to rely on observation to make the basis of classification. Its whole spirit was in essence, so it did not need too much observation, let alone changing conditions to observe, because it innately recognized that conditions were accidental and not the inevitable essence of the phenomenon. Its viewpoint is static, so its so-called evolution is still just unfolding, ready-made unfolding, without new creation. The current science's viewpoint is dynamic, its object is change, and its focus is on mutual relations, so conditions are the direct object of scientific research. Therefore, it not only observes existing things, but also changes conditions to observe. In this way, evolution is not a passive unfolding but an active adaptation. This one is moving and the other is static, this is the different spirit between the current and ancient science, and perhaps the different between Eastern and Western civilizations.

### On the Independence of Scholarship

— Xie Zuoyu

Mr. Hu Shih recently proposed a ten-year plan for Chinese education, advocating that our country should concentrate its efforts within ten years to develop ten top-tier universities that can compete with European and American universities. After that, our country will no longer need to send students to study abroad. In order to strive for the independence of scholarship, our study abroad plan must be terminated. The scholarship and education of a country cannot depend on foreign countries forever.

Hu's plan has aroused considerable debate among domestic scholars. However, these debates are not aimed at denying Hu's major premise. Hu's major premise, or fundamental argument, is:

"Striving for the independence of scholarship." No one dares to deny, and cannot deny, this major premise. The author naturally does not want to deny this major premise, but the author believes that although the goal of "scholarship independence" is clear, the question is how to achieve this goal. Can the goal of "scholarship independence" be achieved by running a few good universities? This is not certain. It depends on the degree of "goodness." And there is a more fundamental question. If this more fundamental question is not resolved, scholarship will still not be independent.

What is the more fundamental question? This is the freedom of thought. The so-called freedom of thought means that thought is free from its own shackles, not limited by traditional thought, nor limited by foreign thought, and has the freedom to come and go alone. There was an advocacy of the "thought liberation movement" in the early Republic of China, which was originally very good. Unfortunately, this movement was not thorough and did not achieve its goal. People who talked about thought liberation in the early Republic of China only knew how to get rid of the shackles of traditional thought, only knew how to oppose the old morality, old etiquette, old literature, and old system, believing that as long as the old was overthrown, our thought could be liberated. They indiscriminately rejected the old. At the same time, they indiscriminately welcomed the new. Any thought, as long as it was novel, they introduced and accepted. One doctrine today and one theory tomorrow, all kinds of things, nothing is not strange. Almost everything in the West is good and worthy of our imitation. So when Dewey came to China, our intellectual circles followed Dewey. When Russell came to China, our intellectual circles followed Russell again. When Durisch and Tagore came to China, a part of our intellectual circles followed these two people again. The same is true for philosophy, politics, education, literature, etc. From the early Republic of China to the present, our intellectual circles have been following Westerners, circling in the scope of Western thought, and acting as gramophones for Western thinkers. Even if their thoughts get rid of the shackles of traditional thought, they have not gotten rid of the shackles of Western thought. Those who are unwilling to be slaves to the thoughts of the ancients are very willing to be slaves to the thoughts of the present people, the Westerners. They removed one kind of shackle, but added another kind of shackle. Their thoughts have never been liberated. The reason is that their thoughts are not independent, only moved by the word "novelty," and blindly bumping around aimlessly. As a result, our intellectual circles have not created any new thoughts. In this way, how can we talk about the independence of scholarship!

Therefore, the author believes that in order to strive for the independence of scholarship, we must first strive for the independence of thought. If thought is not independent, one has no definite views, loses what one holds within, and only blindly hates the old or blindly follows the new. If the ways of today do not change the style of the early Republic of China, then such an attitude will never promote the independence of scholarship. Taking such an attitude to run a university will not run the university well, at best it will follow Western universities, doing its best to imitate, but unable to surpass them. This does not count as scholarship independence. The foundation of scholarship independence lies in the independence of thought and in the innovation of thought.

### The Trend of Modern Thought

— Xie Youwei

After the Great War, there was bound to be a change in the world of thought, a new trend, and this was what everyone expected and eagerly wanted to know. Conflicts and contradictions in thought can lead to suspicion and misunderstanding between people and between nations. We have deeply experienced that the formation of war is related to this. We never want conflicts and contradictions in thought. However, the reality before our eyes seems to be the conflict and contradiction of thought. We see the confrontation between the two major blocs, the United States and the Soviet Union, engaging in a life-and-death struggle in diplomacy. We also see the division of India and the antagonism between the Jewish and Arab communities in Palestine. In France, Italy, Greece, and China, there are also their own political struggles. All of these contain ideological conflicts, political or religious. These conflicts also seem very sharp, very serious, and impossible to reconcile or unify. On the surface, modern thought presents a state of division, contradiction, and complexity. This is what those who care about world peace are concerned about.

However, the divided, contradictory, and complex state of contemporary thought seems to be only a superficial state. We have vaguely seen a glimmer of dawn emerging from these states. In fact, contemporary thought has gradually shifted from a divided, contradictory, and complex direction to a unified, harmonious, and integrated path. We can boldly say that the true trend of modern thought is to move towards unification, harmony, and integration. This can be examined from various aspects.

First, from a cultural or philosophical point of view, in the past, we always thought that Eastern and Western culture or philosophy could never be reconciled and unified. The words of the English poet Kipling, "East is East, and West is West, and never the twain shall meet," were accepted by many Eastern and Western scholars. But everything is different now than it used to be. Now, not only are Easterners striving to understand the West and accept Western culture and philosophy, but Westerners are also striving to understand the East and introduce Eastern culture and philosophy. Recently, the American philosopher F.S.C. Northrop wrote a book entitled "The Meeting of East and West," which represents this attempt. He said: "East and West are meeting, are combining. The era so aptly described and so wrongly predicted by Kipling is past. If we want to understand ourselves, we must understand the East; if we want to avoid another tragedy, another catastrophe, another bloodshed, we must learn how to combine the values of East and West, and that time has come." He believes that not only is it possible to combine Eastern and Western cultures, but it is also necessary. Only the combination of Eastern and Western cultures can express the truth of things and conform to the latest scientific discoveries. In addition, the American philosopher Charles A. Moore and others jointly compiled a book entitled "Philosophy, East and West," advocating that Western philosophers should study Eastern philosophy. Among them, Professor W.E.Hocking wrote: "Easterners are smarter. Their philosophy is often in practical use. They have no philosophy and religion that are not in use. Their reflection is often closely related to their actions. We must learn from the East the practical significance of metaphysics. A nation that can produce such a poor system of thought, such as the logical positivists who declare metaphysical problems to be meaningless, has reason to quietly receive the spirit of the Easterners." From this, we can know that the work of the modern intellectual community does have a trend of Eastern and Western culture and philosophy.

Second, from a political and economic point of view, we also always thought that capitalism and communism were irreconcilable, and that Anglo-American democracy and Soviet democracy could never be combined and reconciled. I am afraid that there are still many people who believe this, because this is what the current situation tells us. However, the current situation is still superficial. From the actual work of contemporary thinkers and politicians, we have reason to believe that this opposition, this conflict, is on the road to unification and harmony. We all know that the United Kingdom and the United States represent capitalism and political democracy, but thinkers and politicians in the United Kingdom and the United States also know that this needs to be revised and supplemented. Thinkers such as Dewey, Russell, and Laski all unanimously attacked and criticized capitalism. Laski's recent book, "Faith, Reason, and Civilization," declares that the establishment of a new belief in the world in the future cannot but take the ideals of the Soviet Union as a guide. Practical politicians, such as President Roosevelt's New Deal and the policies implemented by British Prime Minister Attlee, want to implement the ideal of Soviet economic democracy within the Anglo-American political system, that is, to unify the opposition between economic democracy and political democracy. Whether their attempts are successful is questionable, but at the very least, thinkers and practical politicians are doing this work of unification. Even on the Soviet side, although we do not hear the call to adopt Anglo-American democracy, but comparing the early politics of the Soviet Union with the current stage of politics in the Soviet Union, we cannot but admit that the Soviet Union is also moving towards political democracy, but the progress is slightly slower. It can be seen that the division of modern political economy also has a trend of harmony and unification.

Third, from a religious point of view, we believe that this is the most hopeless for harmony and unification. The complexity and contradiction of current religions are the most headache for politicians and religious figures. I am afraid that no one dares to think of unifying the religions of the world. However, although the current religions are so complex and conflicting, from the history of religious evolution, we cannot but admit that religion is also moving towards harmony and unification. The complexity of modern religion is not as complex as that of ancient religion. Western Christianity and Indian Buddhism have done a lot of unifying work in terms of the number of believers and the breadth of distribution. Moreover, most of the contemporary famous religious figures tend to unify and harmonize religions in their thoughts and propositions. For example, the Indian philosopher Tagore's book "The Religion of Man" advocates replacing the worship of God with the worship of human nature, which has the intention of unifying religion. The American philosopher Professor Hocking's book "Living Religions and a World Faith" also aims to integrate the elements of existing religions in order to establish a world-style belief. Christianity itself has many factions. Apart from the difference between Protestantism and Catholicism, Protestantism itself has many factions. However, it is now heard that many factions within Protestantism have a tendency to unite and combine. In some aspects, they have begun to cooperate. This cannot but be regarded as the beginning of the union of religion from division.

From the above points, the trend of modern thought is indeed striving towards unification, harmony, and integration. Their work is just beginning, so their achievements are not obvious. On the surface, the world's thinking is diverse and very complicated; but if we carefully study it, there are signs of unity in the complexity, and there is a state of harmony in the conflict. We do not seem to need to be blinded by the surface and be overly anxious about the contradictions and conflicts of world thought, or express despair about the future of world peace. A glimmer of light has appeared in the darkness. We should welcome the light and fulfill our responsibility in the intellectual community.

### Wu Jingxiong's Quotations

— Wen Jie

Li Bai looked at nature with a telescope; Du Fu looked at nature with a microscope.

In Li Bai's eyes, the stars in the sky are just fireflies; in Du Fu's eyes, the fireflies on the ground are the stars in the sky.

It is difficult to regard death as returning home, and it is even more difficult to live a life like death.

Sudden death is the only way to avoid death; know that such death means that you have died before you know you have died.

If you say that God only helps those who help themselves, then God is simply like American isolationists; the God in my heart is one who helps those who help others.

To love others as yourself, you must first love yourself as others.

Whether a person is great or not does not depend on the external environment; for a truly great person, adversity only makes him greater.

Anyone who is extraordinary must have a period in his life when he changes from being worldly to being detached from the world, and then from being detached from the world to being a higher level of worldly.

I guess the reason why the East and the West cannot merge is because there are so-called "great men" in the world; in the hearts of the small people in the world, the East and the West have never been divided. If you read the maxims of various countries, we can know how similar the philosophy of the small people in various parts of the world has been from ancient times to the present. On the contrary, if you read the political speeches of today's "great men," you will be surprised at how divergent their views are.

In the winter of 1922, I went to Washington, D.C. to visit my old friend Holmes (the late Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States). He led me to visit his studio. He took out the books on the bookshelf one by one and gave each book a close and affectionate commentary. Finally, he said, "I haven't shown you the best books here yet." I said, "I would like to visit." He said, "Look, those best books are on that bookshelf." My gaze followed his hand to the left corner of the room and landed on an empty bookshelf. I admitted that I was simply confused. I asked the host what this meant: he said, "I'm not joking. Those best books have yet to be written!"

### Interest and Emotion

— Jingwen

The travel season is coming to an end, but it is said that many travel agencies are still fully booked every weekend. Although train and long-distance bus fares have been increased again and again, they cannot stop the pleasure-seeking desires of people who want to temporarily escape the hustle and bustle of the city. Human life is only a few decades, so why not enjoy yourself in time! This is originally an emotional requirement that cannot be blamed.

Playing has no purpose, but it is not without purpose. Can you say that the desire for sensory enjoyment itself does not contain a purpose? However, a pre-arranged purpose may not necessarily satisfy our enjoyment requirements. Two or three friends were chatting enthusiastically tonight, saying that they wanted to eat Wuxi's pork ribs and stir-fried crab roe, and by the way, go to Yuantouzhu to see Taihu Lake, so they agreed to run tomorrow. This Qiu has a purpose, but more importantly, it has "interest."

That's right. True emotional expression cannot be without the mood of interest. The same as emotional expression, recreational activities based on interest and recreational activities for temporary stimulation have an important distinction between truth and falsehood.

Take the current travel fever of ordinary people as an example. As long as you have money, one phone call can register you with a travel agency for the destination you wish to go to. You don't have to worry about tickets, food, accommodation, or even entertainment programs. You don't have to run much from your house to your destination, and you will still be sent back to your house in the end. This is so labor-saving and convenient. However, although this satisfies your travel desire, how much interest does it satisfy?

The problem is not that the travel agency arranges everything for you so thoroughly; even if it is a round-trip express trip on the same day, as long as you are sincerely interested, you can satisfy your interest in a fleeting glance--an emotion based on nature.

This is just a superficial analogy. In the current living environment, things that can stimulate people's true emotions are indeed in strange forms. Flaunting and fashion have become the main emotional tones of life, and the atmosphere of shouting exaggeration covers everything. News headlines are racking their brains to find the daily Headline, articles must pay attention to stimulation, and people must have a "stand," true color, black, white, red, and even gray everything overwhelms the world. The air of art and academics is gone, and under the rigid surface is a scene of absurdity.

This is not a cold, cynical view. The current living phenomenon is indeed very terrible. Some people are now talking about saving people's hearts. But in my personal opinion, this is not just a simple problem of the world going downhill. Revitalizing morality and so on is meaningless, the problem is that people's true feelings are suppressed by layers of false forms and are about to be completely destroyed. To cleanse this atmosphere cannot be done in a short time and in one place. At this time, it is important to allow everyone to work hard in their individual circles of life to maintain their own share of leading interest, that is, to maintain their share of true emotion. Some people criticize playing with things and losing ambition, but today, as long as you can still maintain a share of "playing" interest, you will not worry about falling because of this. You must know that true seriousness not only does not contradict true emotions, but the latter is also an important motivation for the former.

### The Greatness of the World

— Le

In the nineteenth century, the most amazing figure in Wall Street in the United States was Fiske. He started out selling military blankets during the Civil War. By 1869, he was so rich that he could rival a country. He even joined forces with several like-minded partners to monopolize all the gold in the United States. As a result, hundreds of banks were forced into bankruptcy by them, and Fiske's ambitions were not realized in the end. This Mr. Fiske dropped out of school at an early age and was illiterate.

The latest invention of the American door lock is a button. You push open a piece of steel plate on the outside of the lock and you will see eight buttons. Then, according to the code you know, press three of the buttons in succession, and the door will naturally open. If you press the wrong button, the bell will ring loudly immediately inside.

### Terrible Indifference

— Mei Bai

More than a hundred men, women, and children of overseas Chinese on South Sakhalin Island, after living there for decades, finally couldn't bear the oppression of the new occupying authorities, and helplessly abandoned the little property they had left, and returned to their motherland in the cold wind.

However, what did the motherland give them?——It was a scene of embarrassing indifference! The Soviet authorities who transported them back to China discussed with the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, but the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was probably the poorest government agency in Shanghai. Looking for the Shanghai Overseas Chinese Affairs Office of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, they also had no money. Then looking for the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, the Relief and Rehabilitation Administration said that the relief matters had already ended. In the end, Mayor Wu finally agreed to provide them with a strict period of supply. A week will pass quickly, and how they will maintain their lives after that is still uncertain. If I may say it cruelly, perhaps, by that time, the forgetful people of Shanghai will have forgotten them long ago!

In the Dutch East Indies, countless overseas Chinese were displaced and exiled, and were robbed and killed. To this day, the Indonesian authorities' promise to compensate for the losses is still just empty talk, and to this day their lives and property are still without any security. In India, the Xinjiang Hui Pilgrimage Delegation was repeatedly obstructed by the war. The Central News Agency once reported that there were problems with food and clothing, and after that, nothing more was heard about it. In post-war Japan, the so-called Shibuya Incident actually happened!

If it is said that the people in the country deliberately ignore the overseas Chinese, it is not necessarily so. In fact, it is more terrible than "deliberately ignoring" them. They have simply "forgotten" that the overseas Chinese are still Chinese!

### Two or Three Things About Dafu

— Ma Bin

I knew Mr. Yu Dafu fifteen years ago. At that time, Dafu was still engaged in writing novels, but his style was slightly different from that of the Creation Society. The famous "Caishiji" and "Autumn Night on Bilang Lake" were works of this period; when he moved to Hangzhou, he began to write more essays and travel notes, and the Shanghai newspapers happily called him "travel writer," and Yu was also happy about it.

In Hangzhou, although Dafu's financial situation was not very well-off, it was still a "peaceful and prosperous age." He sold his articles to buy wine and had more than enough to live on. His lifestyle was completely different from the chaotic times. Dafu loved to drink. Anyone who invited him with wine would come. He once got drunk in Apricot Blossom Village and wrote a sentence: "Ten days of autumn overcast, the water hits the sky, the lakes and mountains are good, but they are not allowed to be drunk; but with the extremely cheap Hangzhou wine, get drunk in front of Yue Fei's tomb in Xiling." This scene is now unforgettable.

Dafu lived in Hangzhou and liked to socialize. He treated officials, dignitaries, poor people, and students alike. Shao Lizi was an old acquaintance of his in Shanghai. Xuan Tiewu, Zhou Xiangxian, Zhao Longwen, and others had deep friendships with Yu. I remember his reply to Zhao Longwen's sentence "Live another ten years in the world." The lakes and mountains are still the same, but the old travels cannot be looked back on.

Dafu was good at self-intoxication. He once bought aviation lottery tickets, expecting that he would definitely win, and planned the uses as follows: 10,000 yuan remitted to Fuyang to support his mother, 15,000 yuan to support his family in Hangzhou, 5,000 yuan to send to friends, and 20,000 gold left for himself to travel around the world with a wonderful woman... I laughed at him, and immediately said that after living in Sumatra, on the wedding night, he also wrote: "When will Xi Shi follow Fan Li, and talk about the grudges in the misty waters of the Five Lakes." Dafu used this ideal to dispel his middle age, but he finally died for his ambition, alas.

### Foreigners Watching Peking Opera

— Ruyi

The heroine in the play stood at the very front of the stage, with her hands pressed against her chest, singing out her unbearable suffering in a low song. Then she turned her back, raised her feet high, and took a step. The orchestra immediately played hard, and the cymbals made a clanging sound, meaning to let the audience know that she had committed suicide by throwing herself into the sea.

The audience nodded in approval. The noisy sound of the orchestra suddenly changed to a tense allegro, and the hero jumped onto the stage, his legs stiff. He lowered a horse whip, indicating that he had dismounted, and then slightly covered his forehead with his hand to avoid the intense glare of the sea. He saw the girl who was about to sink, and he stepped into the sea (at this time, the sound of the cymbals was loud), and rescued the girl.

The audience was obviously very satisfied, and they comfortably leaned back in their chairs and watched. Ever since the Great Wall of China, they have liked this set. As long as they are willing to come, you can know that they really like it. You must know that a Peking Opera takes longer than watching two movies in a row. An ordinary play takes from 7:00 in the afternoon to 11:00, and a "good" play on Sunday takes from 7:00 to 1:00 or 2:00 in the morning.

The reason why they like Peking Opera may be partly because it is a drama in which the actors and the audience are integrated. The lights in the theater are never turned off. If the stage setting is in line with the plot, it is only a coincidence. The audience needs to imagine when the plot takes place. Except that the stage is slightly higher than the pool seats, there is simply no gap between the actors and the audience.

Newspaper vendors, candy vendors, and small vendors selling fruits and soda come and go, and their business is very prosperous.

The play is still being performed seriously on stage. The villain in the play is also a clown. He stretches out a hand and wipes it under his nose, and the audience laughs. Later, he became more and more cunning, and you can see how much the audience hates him. When the most tense scene came, he prepared to hang himself, but the window sill where he tied the rope suddenly broke, and he fell. The audience laughed so hard that they almost fell over. ...

Translator's note: Whenever there are foreign envoys coming to China, or there are international conferences held in China, it seems that inviting them to watch a Peking Opera has become an indispensable article. But what do foreigners think of Peking Opera? A short article in the November 15th issue of Collier's magazine made me smile after reading it, so I translated it together.

### Integrity

— Wang Baili

Willow South Anecdotes records that the Lushan monk Huanzhu cried for his brother in a poem: "The head is only precious after being cut by a knife, and the bones only smell fragrant after the corpse is not sealed." Records of Poems of the Sui Dynasty records that a woman went to the river and died when the country was broken (unfortunately, I forgot her name). Her slogan on the way said: "Tell the passers-by not to cover their noses, the living are not as fragrant as the dead!" Both poems are calm and powerful, with every word a drop of blood, which is enough to be a model for thousands of years. As for Wang Jingwei's poem in prison, "Drawing a knife to become a fast, not living up to the head of a young man," his heroic spirit is also awe-inspiring. If Wang had died at this time, he would have been righteous and admired by the world, and there would be no need for future generations to say "When a strong wind blows down the parasol tree, others will have their say." But this traitor just happened not to die at this time, but died after becoming a great traitor. It was really good death not death, eating too much rice! This is what Taishigong meant by saying that there is a difference between Mount Tai and a feather in death! Bai Letian's poem says: "The Duke of Zhou was afraid of rumors, and Wang Mang was humble to the lower classes; if he had died in ordinary years, who would know the truth of his life!" If poetry can be borrowed, I will borrow it to chant his deeds.

### The Carefree Flower

— Chen Shenyan

Chapter One: Joyfully Finding a Soulmate (2)

As he spoke, he saw Zhu Zhai standing stiffly beside him, and he smiled and said, "I forgot to introduce you. You two are both devotees of the Mei School and should get to know each other." He pointed at Zhu Zhai and said to the young lady, "This is my nephew Xu Zhu Zhai," and then pointed to the young lady, "This is the very famous Gu Qiwan, Boss Gu. I probably don't need to introduce her, you already know her." The moment Zhu Zhai saw the young lady's face, he guessed that she was Gu Qiwan. Now that Xiao Bai had confirmed it, he took a step closer, gave a slight bow, and called her Boss Gu. Qiwan nodded slightly and smiled. In her heart, she thought that this man was too handsome and could be considered a very flavorful handsome man, and she couldn't help but look at him again. Zhu Zhai turned to Xiao Bai and said, "Let's go sit in the Laijin Yuxuan pavilion. It's too windy here. Uncle, your health isn't good, don't stand here for too long." Xiao Bai nodded and led everyone to Laijin Yuxuan, where they sat down at a tea table. Xiao Bai hadn't eaten anything in the morning, so he ordered a glass of fresh milk. Zhu Zhai and Qiwan each ordered a glass of cocoa. While drinking his milk, Xiao Bai asked Zhu Zhai, "Have you been coming here often recently to practice your singing?" Zhu Zhai replied shyly, "No, it's because the radio station has allowed me to sing a cappella tonight. I'm afraid I'll ruin my voice at the last minute, so I came here to practice." Xiao Bai said, "Just now when you were singing *Yu Tang Chun*, you learned Mr. Mei's intonation very well. Only one or two words were not pronounced quite correctly. You are not from the professional performing industry, so to have achieved this level is already very rare." Zhu Zhai's face turned slightly red as he said, "Uncle, please don't be so complimentary. Just tell me which few words I mispronounced?" Xiao Bai finished the last mouthful of milk in his glass, put the glass down, and pointed at Qiwan with a smile, "She is also a self-taught student of Mr. Mei. You can just ask her and you'll know." Qiwan and Zhu Zhai were meeting for the first time. Even though she knew he had sung it wrong, how could she say it outright? She just smiled slightly and said, "Boss Fei, don't make things difficult for me. How would I know?" Xiao Bai said, "You two are both self-taught disciples of the Mei School and could both become famous. Zhu Zhai, you're just dabbling occasionally, so it doesn't matter if you sing it right or wrong. But Qiwan has such a good natural voice that she must formally become a disciple of Mr. Mei and receive his true teachings. She should not only learn his intonation, but also study his posture, stage presence, and so on." Qiwan said, "Yes, I've long harbored this ambition, but because Mr. Mei is currently far away in Hong Kong, I have no way to become his disciple." Xiao Bai said, "You will always have the opportunity to become his disciple in the future! As for Mr. Mei's morality, he is second to none in the current performing arts circle and can be considered a gentleman. Speaking for myself, I have benefited greatly from Mr. Mei's promotion. For many years, I performed in Shanghai. Because Boss Tan didn't arrive in time, I was asked to fill in. At the time, I was very afraid, fearing that I wouldn't be able to match up and would implicate Mr. Mei. Before the performance, I went to Mr. Mei for advice. Mr. Mei strongly encouraged me, saying, 'As long as you carefully understand the emotions of the play, you will be able to match up. Also your acting is more delicate than others and you understand the emotions of the play, because it's rooted in the script.' Hearing these words, I was truly grateful and considered him a true friend. On the night of the performance, I was very nervous and tried my best to please the audience, but because of my timidity, I showed some weaknesses on stage several times. Mr. Mei helped me through them, so not only was I not embarrassed in front of everyone, but I received applause from the audience."

### Gazing Idly at the Yuntai Pavilion, Counting the Stars of Generals

—

The military situation in North China is sometimes tense and sometimes relaxed. The capture of Yantai had boosted morale, but the recent loss of Shimen has made the situation tense again. As for the consolidation of war gains over the past two years, the widely praised achievement is General Chuan Zuozhi's recapture of Zhangjiakou. He not only secured this "important border town" (there is an archway with this inscription inside the "Dajingmen" gate of Zhangjiakou), but also controlled transportation between the central area and Suiyuan province, which invigorated the northwest region. Its importance is not minor. (Of the three major lines from Beiping to Zhangjiakou, the Hebei section of the Pinghan Railway has long been blocked, and the Pingjin Railway is also frequently damaged. Only the Pingsui Railway is relatively safe and secure, thanks to the protective efforts of General Chuan's forces.) He also has the strength to assist Liaodong and Hebei. Wherever he goes, he intimidates the enemy with his reputation, making him the mainstay for safeguarding the area.

In the northern army, there are two generals who are famously known as the "Generals of Loyalty and Righteousness," which is a rare occurrence. Chuan Zuozhi of Shanxi embodies "Righteousness," while Zixue of Shandong embodies "Loyalty." Both excel at fighting alone with their troops. Twenty years ago, the "General of Righteousness" led the Jin army into Zhangzhou, while the "General of Loyalty" defended Nanyang with the Shandong army alone. They fought against the odds in the same way, which is a remarkable coincidence.

During the War of Resistance Against Japan, the "General of Righteousness" supported the northwest region, while the "General of Loyalty" fought in southern Shandong, both earning reputations for bravery. Now, the "General of Loyalty" holds an important central position, which is certainly a crucial military assignment. However, considering his half-lifetime of military service, it can be said that he has "returned to simplicity after a splendid career." Meanwhile, the "General of Righteousness" is as vigorous as ever, still a "general on horseback" and a "victorious general." Last month, when Jidong was tense, he was invited to assist in the defense. Recently, due to the emergency in Shijiazhuang, the Beiping military headquarters also invited him to discuss military strategies (they met on the 18th and he returned to Zhangjiakou on the 19th). He is truly a general.

Recalling the Battle of Zhangzhou in 1926, it brings Zhang Xueliang to mind. At the time, Zhang Zuolin had established a military government in the Northeast, while Yan Xishan of Shanxi had joined the Northern Expedition. The entire province of Zhili (now Hebei) was under Zhang Zuolin's control. Chuan Zuozhi, under Yan Xishan's command, led a brigade to seize Zhangzhou through a small path, which was very close to Beiping. His daring spirit was similar to Deng Ai of the Three Kingdoms, who took Yinping by surprise. At the time, Zhang Xueliang led his 3rd and 4th Army Corps to attack for months, but could not capture the city. Later, through the efforts of local gentry and merchants, the city was opened to avoid civilian casualties. Zhang Xueliang admired his bravery and treated him with great respect.

In June of the following year, the Northern Expedition was successful. Zhang Xueliang had already surrendered and urged his father to leave the Northeast, remaining behind himself. His father was killed by the Japanese, and Zhang Xueliang succeeded him as the ruler of the Northeast. He eliminated the remnants of Zhang Zongchang's forces and, despite Japanese obstruction, raised the flag of the Republic of China, demonstrating a deep understanding of righteousness. Years later, he was deceived in Xi'an and made a great mistake. Fortunately, he immediately realized his error and has since retreated to the countryside, living a peaceful life from beginning to end. He is truly a wise man, living up to his name "Xueliang" (which means "learn from the good"), and his courtesy name "Hanqing" (which is associated with virtue).

At the beginning of the Western Han Dynasty, Zhang Liang assisted Emperor Gaozu of Han and was one of the "Three Heroes." After achieving success, he retired, studied Taoism, and traveled with Chisongzi, living a life of accomplishment. This is why Zhang Xueliang "learned from Zhang Liang" and adopted the courtesy name "Hanqing."

At the beginning of the Eastern Han Dynasty, General Feng Yi assisted Emperor Guangwu in defeating Wang Mang and restoring the Han Dynasty. He was humble and reserved. Whenever the generals discussed their merits, Feng Yi would always avoid them by sitting under a tree, earning him the nickname "General of the Big Tree." He was one of the meritorious officials depicted in the Yuntai Pavilion. General Feng, who is currently in the Americas, made contributions to the Northern Expedition. He is now nearly seventy years old. Having traveled to the New World, he should be enjoying his remaining years. However, he has repeatedly criticized the domestic situation to foreigners, which is similar to "suing to foreigners." His behavior and words are inappropriate and regrettable. If he had historical knowledge, he should learn from his ancestor Feng Yi, so as not to let "those who learn from Zhang Liang" surpass him in reputation.

Fu Ming made "Righteousness", Yu Zixue made "Loyalty", Zhang can learn from "Liang", Feng does not learn from "Yi".

### Reply to Mr. Qian Qingyun

I have read your letter. I suggest you seek medical attention for a proper examination. Even if you describe your symptoms in detail in a letter, it is not as clear as seeing them in person. Moreover, inquiries by letter often lack clarity, making it difficult to provide an accurate response. Therefore, asking about illness through correspondence is not a proper method. I hope you will understand! (Editor)
