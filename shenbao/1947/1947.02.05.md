General He Yingqin told reporters: He believes that after the United States withdraws personnel from the Executive Headquarters, the Chinese civil war will not become more intense as a result.

American businessmen accuse China of discriminatory and favoritist behavior in implementing the new import control regulations, and of using political pressure to try to exclude American businessmen. The State Department is currently unwilling to say whether there are many such complaints, so the United States has to consider them. It is reported that the US Embassy in China is studying the scandals in the Chinese business community and investigating the complaints of American businessmen. The US Embassy is also closely watching the trend of the Chinese government's plan to nationalize industry and commerce.

### The Issue of Withdrawing US Troops from China; The House of Representatives Plans to Ask Marshal for a Report

### The Adjustment of Foreign Exchange Is Not Allowed; All Rumors Are Groundless; Remarks by a Responsible Official of the Ministry of Finance

### Before the Dissolution of the Executive Headquarters; All Three Parties Were Courteous and Thorough; Frequent Contacts and Interactions in Recent Days

[Our Newspaper Beiping, 4th] The withdrawal work of the Executive Headquarters will be carried out slowly on a broad plan. The Communist Party did not leave in a huff with resentment as generally expected. The US observation group in Yan'an will also extend its "observation" time as much as possible with the consent of both parties. The personnel of the three parties, who have been arguing fiercely for years, are all polite and thorough on the eve of their separation, as if they are leaving room for the future. The reporter silently observes the movements of the Executive Headquarters and finds the following signs: (1) The abolition of the Communist Party's Executive Headquarters is unprecedentedly silent. Not only did Ye Jianying refuse to meet any Chinese and foreign reporters, but its press office also refused to criticize it. Only a certain important person recently made a statement saying that after the US withdraws, since the Kuomintang and the Communist Party have not explicitly announced its cancellation, it seems that another way should be found to decide the existence or abolition of the Executive Headquarters. The implication is quite worthy of consideration. Today, the reporter asked Huang Hua, the spokesman of the Communist Party, whether the Communist Party was satisfied with the withdrawal of the US military this time? Huang replied: This question must be answered by Yan'an. Since the US announced its withdrawal from the Executive Headquarters, the Communist Party has claimed that Yan'an will make a statement, but Yan'an has not published a single word so far. The instructions from Yan'an to Ye Jianying are also only a few words, without any approval. The caution of Yan'an on this matter can be imagined. (2) The withdrawal of Communist Party personnel will not be as rapid as generally expected and as previously announced by the Communist Party. Huang Hua, the director of the Communist Party's press office, will go to Yan'an for contact tomorrow, but will return after staying in Yan'an for one night. Huang said: Because US aircraft still need to transport their own personnel and government personnel, it is impossible to know when the Communist Party will be able to start withdrawing and when the withdrawal will be completed. It is also learned that the US military observation group in Yan'an will also make plans to withdraw after the Communist Party personnel have completed their withdrawal. The reporter asked Huang Hua: Will the Communist Party retain or express its regret for the observation group? Huang replied: Regret is also human nature. (3) There have been frequent contacts between the personnel of the three parties, especially between the Communist Party and the United States. Yesterday, Ye Jianying visited General Gillon, who was suffering from a slight cold, with Chief of Staff Xue Zizheng and Press Office Director Huang Hua. Tomorrow, Ye Jianying is likely to attend Cai Wenzhi's banquet. Ye also plans to host a banquet for the Kuomintang, the United States, and reporters. The harmony of the atmosphere is also unprecedented.

### A Comprehensive Observation of the War Situation This Week

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 4th] Since the Central Committee rejected the government's peace talks proposal, its active treasonous actions have been known to all. However, the strength it holds to betray the country is weakening day by day. Recently, the communist troops, after falsely claiming to restore the situation of January 13, 1946 by violence, launched a large-scale offensive, but they were defeated by the National Army everywhere. As a result, not only did they gain nothing, but they also suffered the greatest losses. The situation of the communist troops' intrusion this week is described as follows:

Southern Shandong

The communist troops under Chen Yi who attacked southern Shandong, claiming to be more than 100,000, came fiercely, captured Yixian, plundered Qizhuang, and cooperated with their exaggerated propaganda offensive. Many people who did not understand the truth were misled by them. In fact, the communist troops paid a great price for the capture of every city and town, so after Zaozhuang fell, the communist troops were exhausted. At this time, the National Army in the eastern section of the Longhai Railway was all deployed, and Hao Pengju's troops also rose up and returned to righteousness at this time. The communist troops in southern Shandong knew that their end was coming and tried to trap themselves. Since January 31, more than 10,000 troops were transferred from Mengyin to reinforce Linyi at full speed. At the same time, they concentrated their main force in the middle area of Zaozhuang, Tancheng, and Linyi to prevent the National Army from counterattacking. Since the 1st of this month, the National Army has been advancing steadily, and a large-scale annihilation war situation has been formed. It is generally expected that a brilliant war country can be obtained within half a month.

Eastern Henan

The communist troops under Liu Bocheng, to coordinate with the National Army in Xuzhou and support southern Shandong, broke through into eastern Henan this week, attacking Tuocheng, attacking Luyi, and capturing Taikang. Although they roamed around, Chen Yi's defeat in southern Shandong was already determined, and it was of no benefit to his overall situation. Moreover, the communist troops in Dangshan, Xiaoba, Yejigang and other places have all been driven back, and the railway between Bian and Xu has resumed traffic. With the help of the elite troops of the National Army in the Dai, Pei, Xiao, and Dang area, not only is the periphery of Xuzhou as solid as a rock, but also the communist troops under Liu Bocheng are in danger of being annihilated by the National Army due to the dispersion of troops.

North China

The National Army, which counterattacked Xiaoyi in western Shanxi, recovered Majiaying, Xiaoyi Village, Sujiaying and other strongholds on January 22, and the communist troops that had invaded Xiaoyi have been shaken. Nanguan Town on the Tongpu Line and Fenxi to the west have been recaptured by the National Army. There are no major communist troops active in southern and western Shanxi. Weijiazhuang and Anding, two military stations on the Pingjin Line in Hebei, were once captured by the communist troops and then recovered by the National Army. Traffic has now resumed, and the National Army has dispatched powerful troops to clear them along the line. In the future, the traffic between Pingjin should be safe. The communist troops on the northern section of the Pinghan Railway used more than 20,000 troops to attack Dingxian fiercely. The communist troops continued to advance, and dead and wounded were everywhere. Although Dingxian was difficult to be captured by the communist troops on January 28, the price they paid was far beyond what ordinary people could imagine. At present, the National Army is advancing in an encirclement posture.

Northeast China

The communist troops who crossed the Songhua River and invaded the south have all been driven back this week. The National Army crossed the Songhua River to pursue them on January 24 and reached the area east of Wukeshu and near Taolaizhao. Later, after the task was completed, they returned safely to the south bank.

Looking at the wars in various parts of the country this week, none of them were launched by the communist troops, and the rules of their conduct are quite similar, that is, at the beginning of the battle, the communist troops attack fiercely with a chaotic posture, while the National Army is steady and steady, so on the surface, the communist troops seem to gain something in the initial battle, but in the end they fail because the price they pay is too high.

### An Industrialist in Shanghai; Talks about Industry and Peace

Continuous Civil Strife Puts Industry in Dire Straits

[Report from Our Newspaper] The reporter recently visited a famous industrialist to ask about the impact of civil strife on industry and his views on the industrial and commercial peace movement. He believes that if the civil strife does not stop, industry will fall into dire straits. Because in the current environment, coal mines are destroyed, transportation lines are cut off, and the supply of raw materials and the sales of products are all problematic. Moreover, due to political reasons, labor disputes are very likely to occur, and unreasonable increases in labor prices make people afraid to invest in industry. Regarding the peace movement, he told the reporter: It is currently in the stage of soliciting members, and concrete practical actions have been considered, but not yet decided. A certain newspaper in this city suggested using strikes and tax resistance as a means, which is a pressure specifically on the government and is only beneficial to the Communist Party, which is unfair as a method of mediation. What may be implemented in the future is to send representatives to Yan'an and Nanjing to appeal separately. Also, all the initiators are willing to solemnly declare that they have no intention of joining the government by mediating.

[Central News Agency, Hangzhou, 3rd] The Zhejiang Journalists Association and eleven other public organizations telegraphed on the 2nd to respond to the Zhejiang Provincial Assembly's declaration in support of peaceful reunification.

### The Soviet Union is Building Economic Spheres of Influence in Various Parts of Xinjiang; Commentary Published by American Howard News Agency

[United Press, New York, 3rd] The Howard News Agency published today that the Soviet Union is now quietly building its economic spheres of influence in various parts of Xinjiang Province, China. When the Chinese Communists and their comrades in the central territory launched propaganda to fiercely attack the US troops stationed in China, it diverted public opinion from paying attention to the new developments of the Soviet Union in Xinjiang. According to the Xinjiang News: (1) One-third of the land in northwestern Xinjiang along the Soviet border is already under the control of the East Turkestan People's Republic. (2) According to the agreement, the northwestern region is still a part of the entire Xinjiang Province, but the People's Republic has thoroughly implemented autonomy, formally prohibiting the National Government army from entering the area. (3) The National Government army is blocked 70 miles west of the provincial capital of Xinjiang. Work on the Soviet oil fields behind the "curtain" has also been suspended. (4) The Soviet Union's influence in this area is not military in nature, but economic and political in nature. Due to the poor management and neglect of the National Government, the Soviet Union has been able to extend its influence. (5) The Central Government has ignored the Xinjiang Provincial Chairman Zhang Zhizhong's repeated requests for political and economic assistance.

### The Sino-Philippine Treaty; Will Be Negotiated Soon

[Our Newspaper Report] London, 4th Broadcast: According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Nanjing, regarding the significant losses of life and property suffered by overseas Chinese during the fighting between Indonesia and the Netherlands in southern Sumatra during the first five days of January, the Chinese government has lodged a serious protest with the Dutch government. It is reported that the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs has suggested to the Dutch and Indonesian authorities to establish safe zones and allow overseas Chinese to arm themselves for self-defense.

[Agence France-Presse, Nanjing, 4th] According to people close to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Chinese government has protested to the Dutch government regarding the losses suffered by overseas Chinese in Palembang, East India, and has suggested re-demarcating overseas Chinese safe zones and organizing overseas Chinese civil defense forces before the restoration of normal conditions, so that they can protect the safety zone with the assistance of the Dutch and East Indian armies. The Dutch and East Indian authorities should respect this safe zone and allow them to evacuate before taking military action. The Dutch authorities in Batavia have accepted China's suggestion and are currently negotiating to discuss its implementation. At the same time, Jiang Jiadong, the Chinese Consul General in the area, has protested to the authorities of the Republic of East India, requesting that they find ways to rescue overseas Chinese. It is reported that the authorities of East India have expressed their apologies and said that they are investigating the recent incidents encountered by overseas Chinese.

According to them, what the overseas Chinese compatriots hope most at present is that the government can send high-ranking officials to Vietnam to express condolences and transport materials by air to provide relief. Evacuation is currently difficult to achieve, and neutral zones are not very useful. The government has allocated 2 million Vietnamese currency for relief funds, and the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission has also allocated 50 million national currency.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 4th] According to external sources, since the Chinese-Vietnamese district of Hanoi, Vietnam, has been surrounded by French troops, our Consul General in Hanoi, Yuan Zijian, has repeatedly contacted the French and Vietnamese authorities separately to find ways to evacuate overseas Chinese compatriots, so that they can move to the western district of Hanoi and the Vietnamese mainland to take refuge. At the same time, he has also requested the evacuation of Vietnamese people on behalf of Vietnam. The French side has also agreed. After the French and Vietnamese sides agreed, it was decided that the evacuation period would be from 8:00 AM to 12:00 PM on January 15. Consul General Yuan personally presided over everything, and the British and American consuls also came to strengthen the safety guarantee for the evacuation of the people. As a result, a total of 7,800 Vietnamese people were evacuated out of the country, and about 200 overseas Chinese families who lived in the mainland or voluntarily evacuated to the mainland, and 600 people were evacuated to the western district. Because the overseas Chinese were observing for the first time, the number of evacuees was not large, but the evacuation order was good.

[United Press, Hong Kong, 4th] The steamer "Xi'an" was burned down on the morning of the 4th. The ship caught fire in the middle of the hull.

### Wang Shusen Embezzlement Case; The Inside Story is Complex

Wang's Elderly Father Receives Reporters

[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 4th] The embezzlement case of Wang Shusen, director of the Liaoning Office of the Northeast Branch of the Executive Yuan, is confusing. The authorities of the office refused to give a definite answer to visiting reporters. In addition, Deputy Director Yu Mingzhou told a reporter from a Shenyang newspaper that although Wang's case involves other people, I am inconvenient to disclose it.

[Our Newspaper, Panyang, 4th] According to an informal statement from the Northeast Branch regarding Wang Shusen's family, the reason for demanding 2.1 million circulation coupons from Wang was to protect Wang, because Wang's wholesale of 100 bags of flour and 400 sets of clothes for refugees was unaccounted for, and it was intended to use this money to compensate. It is also reported that the branch has sent Wang's detained seal, gold ring, watch, etc. to the court. In addition, Wang Zhengshan, an investigator of the Liaoning Office, has fled due to the case. It seems that this case has been divided into two parts, one is Wang's embezzlement situation, and the other is the general public's attention to the process and unique twists and turns of the branch's arrest of Wang.

[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 4th] Wang Shusen's elderly father, Wang Fengyang, told reporters on the 4th: If Wang is guilty of embezzlement, he is willing to be subject to legal sanctions. However, the branch detained Wang in Director Liu's mansion for as long as four days and extorted 2.1 million circulation coupons to seek private reconciliation. At the same time, Wang and Director Liu also have debt entanglements. This move is illegal and requests the public to uphold justice.

### World Food Shortage is Serious; China Faces Famine

The New York Times Calls on Wealthy Countries to Provide Assistance

[Central News Agency, New York, 3rd Dispatch] The New York Times said in an article reviewing the world food situation: Once the United Nations ends its work in Europe and Asia, China will be the worst of the countries facing famine. According to reports from the newspaper's reporters in twenty countries, regardless of what improvements we had hoped to achieve a year ago, the famines in all victorious and defeated countries require assistance from wealthier countries to avoid disaster. It is predicted that Austria, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Poland, and Yugoslavia will all encounter great difficulties after the end of the United Nations, especially China. According to the reporters' reports, the world food shortage was initially caused by the destruction and death of agricultural tools and livestock, and then by the record-breaking drought in Europe last year. In addition to pointing out the necessity of foreign aid, the newspaper also pointed out the extremely important facts, namely the importance of proper food distribution and price controls. The article said: "The people of Britain, Czechoslovakia, Poland, and Yugoslavia all feel the same difficulties, because the black market is rampant in these countries, especially in China, which has hardly been tasted by the government." And said: "Due to the convenience and recklessness of the black market for the rich, the food black market has become an important political factor, and will obviously continue to maintain this situation until the final formal supply is restored." Dou Zun'an, a reporter for the New York Times in Nanjing, reported that after the United Nations stops shipping materials to China around March 31, the situation in China this year will be even worse than usual, which, according to objective statistics, should already be called a famine. After Shi Zun'an pointed out that the famine in our country will inevitably cause a serious disaster this year, he listed the following facts that make the future of the food shortage worrying: (1) There is not much surplus of food left after the normal autumn harvest last year, and the areas with insufficient food may not be able to maintain it until the new harvest. (2) According to the estimate of our Executive Yuan, the harvest in 1947 will be 3 million tons, which will be below the average level. (3) Most of the food in the United Nations plan has been shipped to China and has been distributed. (4) A famine has occurred in Anhui, and the food supply situation in famine-stricken areas such as Hunan, Guangxi, and Guangdong is becoming increasingly critical.

### Zhang Fakui Speaks to Reporters: Guangdong Has Not Arrested Political Offenders; Taking Back Hong Kong and Macau is Necessary to Eliminate Smuggling

[Our Guangzhou Dispatch, 4th] Director Zhang Fakui recently held his first press conference of the year at his official residence in the Governor's Office. He reported on his observations on the constitution-making process, as well as the anti-smuggling and security situation in Guangdong. He stated: The constitution, which determines all major plans for our country, has been successfully passed. This is the most progressive democratic constitution in the world and the soul of democratic politics. This year is the year for preparing for the implementation of constitutional governance. Both the government and the public must work together, especially officials, who should take the lead in abiding by the law as an example to the people, in order to achieve the goal of rule of law. As for rumors circulating that political prisoners have been arrested here, these are completely malicious slanders and have no basis whatsoever. Since the restoration of Guangdong, no political prisoners have ever been arrested. Secondly, regarding smuggling cases, a particularly large number occurred at the end of last year, such as the smuggling cases involving the Haiou warship and landing craft. These have been forwarded to the capital for handling separately. The anti-smuggling work in other local areas has been strengthened, and the trend of smuggling has slightly subsided. However, to completely eliminate it, there is no other way but to take back Hong Kong and Macau. As for the issue of security, I have always paid close attention to it. According to statistics on bandit suppression achievements in the 35th year of the Republic (1946), over 6,000 people were killed, over 3,000 were wounded, and over 2,600 surrendered and reformed. Currently, there are still about 13,600 remaining bandits, of which 6,000 are on Hainan Island, and the rest are distributed along the Fujian-Guangdong border and the Jiangnan Road area in the northeast. However, to completely quell the bandit problem, sound local administrative organs are essential for effective results.

### Editorial: Thinking of Farmers from the Gold Rush

In the past two days, the gold and foreign exchange markets in Shanghai have experienced drastic fluctuations. Regarding gold, speculators stirred up trouble a month ago, causing the price of gold to rise. The Central Bank then continuously released large amounts of gold, and the market situation stabilized. However, on the 1st of this month, the gold and foreign exchange markets suddenly surged again, jumping out of the 3,965,000 range, crossing the 4,000,000 mark, and rising to 4,060,000. By Monday of this week, it continued to rise to 4,420,000. As of the time of writing, it has risen to 4,800,000, with a strong tendency to cross the 5,000,000 mark. During the same period, the black market exchange rate for U.S. dollars rose from 7,000 to 9,000 yesterday. In the tide of skyrocketing gold prices, it has also caused fluctuations in other commodity prices. Taking cotton yarn as an example, the cotton yarn market on November 1st was overwhelmed by buying pressure, and yarn prices rose across the board. On the second day, the upward trend intensified, and yarn prices jumped by 500,000 to 600,000 in a single day. The 42-count double-strand yarn returned to the 5,000,000 mark, and the future of the yarn market still seems to be thriving. As for rice prices, the changes in the past few days have also been significant. These drastic fluctuations in the market have not yet shown signs of stopping. The impact of this relates to the safety of the entire national economy. We cannot ignore these economic fluctuations.

The reason for the rise of these economic fluctuations, according to our observation, seems to be traceable to the rumors that were spread not long ago, saying that the government would have new adjustments for foreign exchange. Although the authorities have repeatedly denied these rumors, speculators have not only not stopped because of this, but have instead fueled the flames and stirred up trouble. According to a report in this newspaper on January 1st, "The black market exchange rate for U.S. dollars has skyrocketed, and the price of gold has been driven up." Later, after the price of gold was raised, it then affected the foreign exchange market and other market prices. During this period, although the Central Bank released a huge amount of gold, it failed to stop the rise in gold prices. Moreover, some speculators, seeing that the Central Bank had repeatedly released large amounts of gold, even believed that its strength was insufficient to control the gold market, and therefore showed off their skills. Under these chaotic circumstances, it was heard that the Central Bank had to temporarily suspend the release of gold; the result of this was that it caused another rise in gold prices, the black market exchange rate for foreign exchange, and other general market prices. After these factors played a mutually alternating role, the market has not been able to return to tranquility.

Regarding the current market fluctuations, we believe that psychological factors are playing a major role. The initial market fluctuations were due to rumors. The spread of rumors, coupled with the speculators stirring up trouble, brought things to a very dangerous state. Taking advantage of these unhealthy psychological conditions to stir up trouble is certainly a consistent trick of speculators; but the existence of this unhealthy psychology is ultimately a morbid state. This unhealthy psychology is a manifestation of a lack of self-confidence. In today's turbulent world, we must first establish self-confidence. Therefore, the first thing we should propose for this market fluctuation is to restore our self-confidence and not be misled by circulating rumors. The spread of rumors itself originally has a malicious effect; if we are misled by rumors, in the end, not only will individuals suffer losses, but the nation and country will also be greatly affected.

Establishing a healthy psychology is certainly what the general public should do, but we cannot help but ask: What policy is the government adopting for gold? Selling gold seems to be the consistent policy of the Central Bank, that is, the government, but the result of its implementation has still failed to effectively suppress the price of gold. What exactly went wrong in this? In early May of last year, when the price of gold fluctuated, the Central Bank released more than 3,000 bars of gold in three days. At that time, the price of gold hovered around 1,600,000 to 1,700,000. By July, it had risen to 1,970,000, and by December, it had risen to 3,900,000. According to statistics published by the Shanghai Municipal Government, if the price of gold in January of the 35th year of the Republic (1946) was 100, it had risen to 214 by July, which is an increase of 114 times in six months. Therefore, despite the Central Bank's gold sales, it initially failed to curb the rise in gold prices. As a result, it merely created opportunities for general speculators or those engaged in gold trading to hoard gold, causing these people to get rich. It is heard that some of the customers who were allocated gold by the Central Bank yesterday hoarded the allocated gold without releasing it, which further contributed to the rise in gold prices. Therefore, at this time of gold price fluctuations, we must ask what policy the government is adopting for gold.

Needless to say, the skyrocketing price of gold has affected general commodity prices and promoted the rise in general living expenses. Today, China's industrial and commercial sectors have reached an extremely difficult state, and the increase in general living expenses will undoubtedly affect them. Because the increase in general living expenses inevitably affects the increase in the cost of living index for employees; and today, the standard wage rate is based on the cost of living index, its impact will inevitably promote the increase in general wages, adding to the burden of those engaged in industry and commerce. Currently, traffic is obstructed, and the circulation of goods has been hit hard; moreover, we are facing the invasion of cheap imported goods. China's industrial and commercial sectors are already on the verge of danger. If we add the impact caused by the current skyrocketing price of gold, in the end, it seems certain to force the collapse of general industry and commerce. In order to save our national economy, we must not allow this frenzy to continue unchecked.

However, those who are most deeply affected are still the farmers who account for more than 80 percent of the Chinese people. Yesterday was Farmers' Day, and it is extremely natural for Farmers' Day to be a theme for farmers to complain about their hardships. However, regardless of rent reduction or land to the tiller, the biggest difficulty currently encountered by farmers lies in "cheap grain hurting farmers." The so-called "cheap grain" does not necessarily refer to grain, but refers to the low prices of general agricultural products, making it difficult for farmers to make a living, forcing them to abandon production. According to a report in this newspaper yesterday, the China Silk Company is willing to give 15 million mulberry seedlings to Zhejiang Province, but the farmers of Zhejiang Province believe that the price of silk is too low to make a profit and do not dare to plant them, which shows that the low prices of agricultural products are forcing farmers to abandon agricultural production. If we let this trend develop naturally, it will make the future of the entire national economy unimaginable. Now we see a general increase in commodity prices caused by the fluctuations in gold prices, but the prices of agricultural products have failed to follow this trend upward. As a result, the increase in the prices of general manufactured goods will turn to make the prices of general agricultural products relatively fall. The prices of agricultural products are already cheap, and now they are being forced to fall again, which will naturally make the lives of farmers even more difficult. On the occasion of Farmers' Day, we do not need to talk grandly about rural relief. What is most urgent is to seek the stability of general commodity prices and the increase in the prices of agricultural products; it must be made profitable for farmers to engage in agriculture before China's agricultural production can have hope of vigorous recovery. Agriculture is the main production of our country. If agriculture cannot recover, then what can be imagined for the future of the national economy?

In short, the volatility of the gold price is of great importance. In addition to urging the people to establish a sound mentality, we also hope that the government can clarify its policies so that the gold price and general commodity prices can be stabilized. As for the reported volatility of gold prices and general commodity prices, it is due to the deterioration of the domestic situation, which is especially not what Shen Bao wants. We hope that everyone can build up self-confidence.

### Treating the Root Cause and Relieving the Emergency Simultaneously: Zhejiang Seawalls are Safe from Tides; No Disaster Expected from Spring or Autumn Tides This Year

[Our Hangzhou Dispatch, 4th] Chairman Shen returned to Hangzhou last night and went to Sibao and Wubao today to inspect the seawall project and visited the Pan En, the first ocean-going vessel on the Qiantang River. Since the spring tide is approaching and the seawall project depends entirely on Tangshan's stone transportation, Shen praised the ship highly.

[Our Hangzhou News] As the spring tide approaches, the residents along the Qiantang River are worried about the seawalls. This is because the Seawall Engineering Bureau has recently been preparing for permanent engineering projects, while the stone seawalls that have already collapsed have not yet been repaired. If the temporary earthen dikes are breached, there will be no materials to repair them in time. Therefore, they do not approve of the Seawall Engineering Bureau not doing the work of "1947" but being obsessed with the "work of 1951." This is truly not the right thing to do. This reporter made a special visit to Dr. Tang Zhenxu, Deputy Chief Engineer and Director of the Design Department of the Seawall Engineering Bureau. According to him, the preparation work for the permanent root-cause treatment plan is only one-sixteenth of this year's work; the important focus is still on temporary rescue engineering; next year, permanent repair engineering can be carried out, that is, replacing the earthen dikes with stone seawalls. The true root-cause treatment plan must wait two years before it can begin, and it will also take six years. Both the spring and autumn tides this year can be safely passed without causing disasters. As for the Qiantang River experimental research, there was a proposal to establish it at Zhejiang University, but the Water Conservancy Commission intends to establish it in Nanjing. For the convenience of the Seawall Engineering Bureau, it may be established in our bureau in Hangzhou.

Editor: We are farmers from the countryside. The most urgent need for farmers is oxen. During the war, most of the oxen were taken away by the enemy and puppets or slaughtered. With the arrival of victory and rural recovery, the supply of oxen is lacking. It is urgent to cultivate calves. However, butchers are abandoning the fundamental for the trivial, purchasing small yellow calves aged three to five months at high prices to supply slaughterhouses for sale. With spring plowing imminent, the supply of oxen cannot meet the demand, which is a matter of great concern for rural production! We hope that the authorities will quickly issue a ban, and pay more attention to the cultivation of calves in particular to maintain agriculture. (A Country Bumpkin)

Residents of Chang'an Road Seek Safety

Editor: We live on Chang'an Road in the Zhabei Xinzha Bridge area. During the enemy-puppet period, there was a cotton military uniform factory, originally named "Management General Supervision Department Special Military Uniform Office." We don't know why it was not taken over or closed after the victory, but was changed to its current name, "United Flower Clothing Factory," which is a small factory. The equipment in the factory is extremely imperfect, especially the fire-fighting equipment is lacking, and the person in charge is a so-called "outsider," resulting in continuous fires in the factory. Neighboring residents have suffered a lot. Several times of negotiation have been ignored. A fire broke out again the other day (26th), and the fire was so intense that it could not be controlled, which has been reported in the newspapers. Fortunately, the firemen worked hard to extinguish the fire, so the property of the residents was spared. Chang'an Road is narrow, like a lane. Most of the houses on the road are old houses from before the war. If one house is in trouble, it will inevitably spread. Therefore, we especially ask for a corner of your newspaper to disclose this matter, hoping that the relevant authorities will investigate and correct it, so as to maintain the safety of our property. (Residents of No. 8, Jia 4, Bao 14, Shanghai)

### Exorbitant Rent Increases in Remote Streets

Editor: I live in Shudeli, Nanjing Street, behind the Shanghai Military Camp Police Station in the Nanshi district. The location is remote, and most of the residents are poor and struggling.

The municipal government has previously announced restrictions on arbitrary rent increases, and the Municipal Council also has discussions on restricting rent increases. Now, the landlord in that area violates the law and disregards the difficulties of the people. Please disclose this matter in your newspaper and urge the municipal authorities to effectively stop it.

As for the number of people to be hired, this bank is coordinating it." Sincerely.

### Control of Atomic Energy Program, US Strives to Implement Original Intention, Universal Disarmament Hopes to Achieve Solution

[United Press, Lake Success, 4th] According to information obtained this morning: US Representative Austin will attend today's opening meeting. Austin had previously assured that the United States would disarm as quickly as any other country, but only if the great powers abandoned control of atomic energy, concluded a general peace treaty, and established an international police force. Austin will insist at today's meeting that atomic weapons should be controlled and will point out that the United States has been working on this issue for six months. Mr. Austin will also explain that if the great powers cannot reach an agreement on how to ban atomic weapons and how to monitor and prevent the illegal manufacture of atomic bombs, then universal disarmament is fundamentally hopeless. Mr. Austin will also solemnly point out that the greatest purpose of the United Nations organization is collective security, and the core work of collective security is international control of atomic energy. In order to break the deadlock between the United States and the Soviet Union on the disarmament plan, Austin will propose a three-point compromise plan that has been secretly discussed with other representatives: (1) Establish a committee to discuss detailed methods for abandoning weapons, especially weapons of "collective destruction"; (2) Security Council representatives should determine the definition of weapons of "collective destruction" and explain how universal disarmament and the establishment of an international police force are related; (3) The Security Council should begin to discuss the US plan to ban atomic weapons at this meeting. Most representatives are carefully considering this plan, and the British representative will propose amendments, but the final instructions from London are still awaited. The Soviet Union is expected to oppose the US plan.

### Secrets of Manufacturing Atomic Bombs, Soviet Union Has Obtained Important Information, Baruch Reports to Congress

[Associated Press, Washington, 3rd] Former US Representative to the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission Baruch reportedly stated at a secret meeting of the Senate Atomic Committee that there is evidence that the Soviet Union has learned to some extent about the secrets of the United States manufacturing atomic bombs, but the Soviet Union is not yet sure of the meaning of the secrets it has learned and how to use them. Previously, Baruch had accused scientists in the Senate Atomic Committee of not making a big mistake by publishing the Smith Report of 1945. At this point in Baruch's speech, the committee asked the audience to leave and closed the meeting room door to continue listening to Mr. Baruch's report. The content of the report may not be disclosed to the outside world by any member. However, an Associated Press reporter learned the outline from a member and confirmed it from another member. Baruch also stated in the Senate Atomic Committee that based on certain questions raised by the Soviet representative at the United Nations Atomic Energy Control Commission, it is evident that the US defense against the manufacture of atomic bombs has been leaked. For example, the cipher used by the US has obviously been learned by the Soviet Union, but judging from the words of its representatives, the meaning of the cipher is not yet clear. Mr. Baruch said that Canada also discovered primordial elements, and Soviet spies had been arrested in Canada, which shows that the Soviet Union had learned some secrets from Canada.

### Bevin Signs Five-Nation Peace Treaty

### Economic System for the Ruhr Area, France Prepares Memorandum, Sent to Britain, America, and the Soviet Union

[France News Agency, Paris, 3rd] The French government sent a memorandum to the British, American, and Soviet ambassadors to France on the 1st of this month, clarifying its views on the future economic system of the Ruhr area. The memorandum is purely technical in nature and states that the Ruhr area should never again be an industrial base for German aggression. The resources of the Ruhr area should be used to promote the common interests of peaceful countries. Before the war, the coal production in the Ruhr area accounted for 90% of the country, the production of pig iron accounted for 72%, and the production of steel accounted for 74%. Therefore, its importance is very great. The implementation of a special economic system in the Ruhr area is necessary to achieve the following objectives: (1) Develop coal production to the maximum extent and ensure that coal distribution is determined according to needs. (2) The amount of Ruhr products enjoyed by Germany should be determined in the peace treaty. In short, the Ruhr area should be regarded as the common property of peaceful countries.

### Canadian Prime Minister Opposes a Few Countries Dominating Peace

[Reuters, Ottawa, 4th] Canadian Prime Minister King stated in Parliament today that Canada is determined not to allow a very small number of countries to "rule" peace. We have fought to prevent two countries from ruling the world, so we are determined not to allow two or three countries or four or one country to rule peace. I hope the Big Four can seriously consider this.

### United States Maintains Non-Interference Policy on Palestine, Britain Orders Jewish Associations to Cooperate in Suppressing Terrorism, Bevin Holds Talks with Jewish Representatives

[France News Agency, Washington, 4th] Although local political circles regret the tense situation in Palestine, the US government's non-interference policy will not change. The US official view is the same as in the last letter from former Secretary of State Byrnes to British Foreign Secretary Bevin, that is, if Arabs and Jews participate in the London round table conference on the Palestine issue, the United States will also send observers.

[Associated Press, London, 4th] Former leader of the Jewish Association Weizmann set off for Palestine today, and it is said that his mission is related to the British government's request for him to cooperate in suppressing terrorist activities.

[United Press, Jerusalem, 3rd] The Palestinian government issued a harsh ultimatum to the Jewish Association here tonight, ordering them to cooperate with the military and police to arrest extremists within seven days. The ultimatum did not mention what measures the government would take if this request was rejected. According to unconfirmed news, if this request is rejected, in addition to the British taking active military action against Jewish extremists and possibly implementing martial law, Britain will not recognize the international status of the Jewish Association. At the same time, British Foreign Secretary Bevin and Colonial Secretary Jones held talks with representatives of the Jewish Association in London for two and a half hours. Officials remained silent about the results of the talks, but pointed out that the gap in opinions between the two sides on resolving the Palestine issue has not narrowed. It is said that the Jewish representatives requested: (1) increase Jewish immigration to Palestine; (2) comprehensively develop Palestine's resources; (3) establish a Jewish state in suitable areas, that is, in areas with development potential. It is also learned that the British government and Arab leaders will continue to hold meetings on the 4th, when Bevin will inform the Arab representatives of the details of his talks with the Jewish representatives.

There are 13 other countries with different domestic control situations, or have manufactured or stored uranium ore. These 13 countries are Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Chile, China, Czechoslovakia, India, Africa, Poland, Portugal, and South Africa. The Soviet Union has been researching atomic fission machines for several years. Canada produces large quantities of polonium. France is building an "atomic village" to concentrate research. The British government officially announced plans for five atomic research institutes, and its plan is only limited by scientists and raw materials. The largest research and development factory is in the United States. President Truman listed $443 million in the 1947-1948 budget related to atomic manufacturing.

According to scientist Li ShuHua, who announced in Shanghai last fall, the Academia Sinica plans to purchase an atomic fission machine from the United States for $250,000 to start researching atomic energy.

### Tumult in Palestine

—Special Translation by This Newspaper's Editorial Office

…The sacred land of the past has become today's world of darkness…

Recently, Jewish extremists in Palestine have reignited the flames of terror, plunging various regions into extreme chaos. A certain journalist recounts the witnessed reality as follows:

Amidst the Christmas and New Year greetings, the holy land of Palestine is a dark world. Due to the various atrocities committed by Jewish terrorist groups in recent days, including the kidnapping and assassination of British personnel, many British soldiers now carry weapons even when off duty. The reporter witnessed over a hundred paratroopers, heavily intoxicated, brandishing machine guns and taking over Zion Square in the center of Jerusalem. Pedestrians fled in panic to avoid becoming innocent victims.

Previously, British soldiers would only whisper and gossip about Jews in private, but now they openly insult them in public. Anti-Jewish rhetoric from British officials is ubiquitous in nightclubs and bars. Occasionally, there are also incidents of Jewish shop windows being smashed and Jews being insulted in public places.

Stores Close Early: Shops and cafes throughout the country now close as early as 6:00 PM every evening. Steel plates are installed on shop windows and doorways to prevent them from being smashed. This anti-Jewish sentiment among the British is a result of the violence perpetrated by Jewish terrorist groups against British forces. British soldiers see themselves as individuals, not as enforcers of British policy in Palestine. Therefore, when a Jewish terrorist kills a British soldier, other British soldiers feel a sense of shared animosity and vengeance, especially veterans who feel it is not worth dying in the holy land after surviving the war. However, most British soldiers are able to restrain their emotions, and while they talk a lot, they rarely take action. Many Jews acknowledge this point.

Initially, British soldiers flogged a young Jewish man who robbed a bank, so on December 29th of last year, Jewish terrorists retaliated by flogging one British officer and three soldiers. This sparked a new wave of uncontrollable terrorist activities. Later, the terrorist groups used a new weapon – liquid flamethrowers – against the British. While the World Zionist Congress was being held in Basel, Switzerland, the Irgun temporarily announced a ceasefire, but now they have resumed their fight against the British.

Bombings Occur Frequently: Bomb explosions in Jerusalem have spread throughout the holy land. British authorities have ordered all troops to carry weapons and to patrol in pairs. On the 3rd, the British government issued an ultimatum to Jewish terrorist groups: if acts of terror continue, the British government will take strict measures, such as the military control and strict curfews that were implemented after the bombing of the King David Hotel last summer. The British High Commissioner for Palestine, Lieutenant General Sir Alan Cunningham, hastily traveled to London to discuss strategy with Colonial Secretary Arthur Creech Jones and Chief of the Imperial General Staff, Field Marshal Montgomery. Both the British government and the Jews believe that Cunningham's trip is to seek government permission to launch a full-scale military offensive against Jewish extremists.

Jews are Divided into Two Factions: A spokesman for the Jewish Agency in London recently issued a statement expressing regret for the actions of Jewish extremists, saying, "The British Empire is not threatened by the actions of the Irgun; the future Jewish nation is much more likely to be threatened." Dr. Stephen Wise, the founder of the Zionist Organization of America, returned from the Zionist Congress dissatisfied with his role in the organization, criticizing the Congress for not considering remedies for the state of terror in Palestine.

British and Jews May Reach Understanding: Judging from the reaction of these moderate Jews, the aim of Jewish terrorist atrocities is not only to challenge the British Army, but also to undermine the compromise policies of the moderates. However, Zionist leaders in London continue to stubbornly seek an agreement. The leader of the Jewish Agency, Goldmann, and the chairman of the previous World Zionist Congress hope to encourage the British to change the status quo in Palestine. The reason Jews refused to attend the London Palestine Conference last month was because of the existence of this "status quo." Goldmann stated that although an agreement cannot be reached for the time being, the goodwill of the Colonial Office may facilitate cooperation and understanding between the British and the Jews.

British troops in Palestine are fully armed, patrolling along the railway line to prevent Jews from laying mines.

### Attending Meeting Receiving Secret Report: Seymour Road Fire Case Takes Unexpected Turn; Involving a Group of Police Officers

Victim, surnamed Ge, Has Important Evidence to Offer; Director Xuan Indicates That More Than 20 People Need to Be Summoned

[Report from This Newspaper] Ge Kexin, Chairman of the Seymour Road Fire Investigation Committee, Zhang Naizuo, representative of the Municipal Council, and others are scheduled to visit the Fire Department today. This morning at 10:00 AM, they will gather at the City Hall Auditorium, where Fire Chief Zhou Zhaoxiang will briefly report on the current fire prevention facilities. Afterwards, they will visit various fire departments to compare the tool facilities, economic allocation, and personnel system with the fire alarm system during the Public Works Department era in order to serve as a reference for improvement measures.

The work to excavate the Wang Family Fire Site was originally scheduled to begin yesterday, but due to personnel not being ready, it has been changed to start at 2:00 PM today. Zhang Da, Director of the Police Bureau's Supervisory Office, Wang Qilin, Deputy Director of the Jiangning District Sub-bureau, Liu Jingnuo, representative of the District Residents, Shao Yongsheng, representative of the District Party Department of the Municipal Council, and others held a meeting at the residence of Ba長長 Cai Guoliang on Xiaoshadu Road yesterday afternoon and decided to first withdraw 600,000 from the city government to hire 10 laborers for excavation. Under the leadership of Director Zhang, representatives from the police sub-bureau, the Ba甲 Department, and the Wang family will be on site to supervise. The excavation work is scheduled to be completed within three days. Director Zhang and others inspected the fire site yesterday and have determined the excavation location, steps, and ash disposal area.

Zhang Naizuo, representative of the Municipal Council, received a letter of introduction from lawyer Zhang Shizhao yesterday, stating that a victim named Ge has important evidence to provide to the Fire Investigation Committee. Ge visited Zhang Naizuo yesterday, but Zhang was out on business, so the nature of the evidence is currently unknown. However, Ge indicated that it would be very powerful evidence of a crime. Details will be clear today. Zhang also told reporters that he learned yesterday that some victims had secretly reported to the Municipal Council that 30 minutes after the fire, two detectives and a patrol officer arrived to watch. After 12:00 AM, dozens of police officers suddenly arrived, stood for ten minutes, and then entered the fire site without the consent of the public. Some people witnessed one of them with the number 1850, and another wearing a police uniform under a short coat, with Western hair and dark skin. When they came out of the fire site, their pockets were full and they looked triumphant, returning to the scene an hour and a half later, suspected of taking advantage of the fire to loot. Zhang has decided to inquire about the details from the Municipal Council today and investigate further.

Collection of Data is Extremely Rich

The Fire Investigation Committee has collected extremely rich data to date. The work from now on will be to pursue the existing clues one by one. For example, the Wang family's wine bottles, the Yan family's uniform, and the split wardrobe will all require questioning firefighters one by one to uncover the facts of the crime. Yesterday, the committee indicated that whether this work will continue to be carried out by the Investigation Committee depends on the mayor's decision.

### According to the Report, More Than 20 People are Suspected

Ge Kexin, Chairman of the Investigation Committee, submitted part of the investigation report to Mayor Wu yesterday morning. Mayor Wu indicated that Director Xuan could review it first, so after Director Xuan reviewed it, it was submitted to Mayor Wu yesterday afternoon. According to the Investigation Committee, Director Xuan believes that according to this report, there are still more than 20 suspects related to the case who need to be detained and may need to be summoned again today. The police bureau's report on the fire has long been drafted and is expected to be published after the mayor reviews it. Yesterday, reporters made a special visit to Mayor Wu. The mayor stated that the police bureau's report is still under review and has not been completed due to being busy with suppressing rice prices recently. When asked when it could be published, Mayor Wu indicated that it seemed to have no value for publication because the police bureau's representative (Zhang Da, Director of the Supervisory Office) participated in the Fire Investigation Committee, so the Investigation Committee's report must be more detailed, objective, and fair.

The Investigation Committee is About to Dissolve

When asked what his thoughts were on the case, Mayor Wu replied, "It is the joint determination of myself and Director Xuan to thoroughly investigate this case, seek the truth, and prevent future troubles. How things should be resolved still depends on the Investigation Committee's full report." Mayor Wu also stated that the Investigation Committee will dissolve after collecting all the data, and the police bureau will take over the investigative work that still needs to be carried out and the criminal aspects of the case.

### Today, the District Prosecutor's Office Summons Five Victims

### Morphia King Ye Qinghe's Legacy of Poison? Hidden Opium Case in Flower Bed Opens for Trial; All Three Defendants Claim to Know Nothing About the Origins

Informant's Name Temporarily Not Announced; Court Hearing Rescheduled for Further Inquiry

[Report from This Newspaper] Pei Yuanjun, Zhou Asan, and Shi Zhaoguang, the three suspects in the case of 20,000 taels of opium hidden in a flower bed at 31 Dade Lane, Linsen West Road, were tried in court yesterday. According to the investigation report from the Changshu Branch Bureau that cracked the case, on the 13th of last month, at 5:00 PM, police officer No. 339 reported to the duty room that seven or eight people in military uniforms had entered 31 Dade Lane, claiming to be searching for opium. The bureau sent people to investigate and found that these military personnel were Zheng Zhongwei, the police chief of the Port Management Committee and deputy director of the Garrison Command's Pending Disposal Office, who had received a secret report that a large quantity of opium was hidden in the flower bed at 31 Dade Lane, so he sent people to excavate. The police bureau then jointly searched and found a large amount of opium in wooden boxes under the cement flower bed in the courtyard, weighing a total of 1,058 catties. The owner of the house, Pei Yuanjun, was out and had not returned, so his wife, He Lanjun, was taken to the bureau for questioning. Pei Yuanjun was arrested at the Shenkang Silk Weaving Factory branch at 4 Rongji Lane, Guangdong Road, and the gardener Zhou Asan and Shi Zhaoguang, the original owner of 31 Dade Lane, were also arrested at Hollywood Garden, Yuyuan Road. During yesterday's trial, according to Pei Yuanjun's statement:

### The Eventful Autumn of the Transportation Industry; Beijing-Shanghai Train Damaged in Changzhou; The Entire Line is Delayed for Six Hours; Driver Remains Calm and Fortunately No Accident Occurs; No Loss to Passengers or Freight

[Report from This Newspaper] The No. 10 upbound night express train with first, second, and third class cars on the Beijing-Shanghai line departed from the North Station at 9:50 PM the night before last. At 2:27 AM yesterday morning, when it arrived near Changzhou Station, 167 kilometers from Shanghai, the front wheel of the locomotive suddenly broke. The cars attached were affected by this and experienced violent vibrations, almost derailing and overturning. Fortunately, the driver remained calm and handled the situation properly, and no accident occurred. There was no damage to passengers or goods.

The accident site happened to be in the middle of the Beijing-Shanghai double-track traffic area, causing the traffic on the Beijing-Shanghai line to be affected and completely blocked. The train was stopped for as long as six hours. Later, the Qishuyan Car Factory of the Railway Bureau sent a rescue train to rush to repair it, and the entire line's traffic was restored at around 8:00 AM yesterday.

The damaged area of the locomotive was in the wilderness. After the police department of the bureau heard about it, it urgently dispatched nearby railway police to rush to protect it in case of emergency.

Due to the obstruction of the No. 10 train, traffic on the Beijing-Shanghai line was once interrupted, and all trains were delayed. The No. 9 and No. 11 trains from Beijing to Shanghai the night before last were each delayed by about six hours. The No. 6 and No. 8 early trains from Shanghai to Beijing and the No. 5 and No. 7 early trains from Beijing to Shanghai at the North Station yesterday morning were temporarily suspended for one day.

In order to alleviate passenger congestion, the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Bureau opened an additional first, second, and third class temporary express train at 2:00 PM yesterday afternoon, and all tickets already sold for the No. 6 and No. 8 trains were generally valid. It is heard that Nanjing also added a temporary first, second, and third class passenger train at 2:00 PM yesterday afternoon to carry passengers from Beijing to Shanghai on the No. 5 and No. 7 trains yesterday morning.

Yesterday, passenger trains in Suzhou, Wuxi, and other places still operated normally and were not interrupted.

### Temporary Special Train to Cease Operation Starting Tomorrow

[Report from This Newspaper] The Beijing-Shanghai Railway Bureau previously added temporary special trains on the 26th of last month to adjust for congestion. Now, because passenger and freight transportation has returned to its original state, the Railway Bureau has decided to stop operating these temporary special trains starting tomorrow.

### Two Companies' Passenger Planes; Have Not Received Resumption Order; Passenger Registration is Very Congested; Expected Resumption is Not Far Off

[Report from This Newspaper] There is still no confirmation on when Central and China Airlines will be able to resume passenger transportation. The rumor that Central Airlines has received an order from the Ministry of Communications to resume flights yesterday is not true. According to the person in charge of the company, no such order has been received, so no passengers have been carried on the flights that took off in the past two days. However, it is expected that the resumption period is not far off. Since the suspension this time, air transportation has been stagnant for a week, and passengers have been extremely inconvenienced. Those who go to the company to register for passenger seats in advance are very crowded. If the suspension continues for a long time, it will be even more difficult in the future.

### Preparations for the 4th Drama Festival; Decision on Eight Measures; Relief for Poor and Sick Artists

[Report from This Newspaper] This month, the 15th is the 4th Drama Festival. The Municipal Cultural and Sports Committee, the Actors' Association, the Municipal Experimental Drama School, the Theater Commercial Association, the Shanghai Drama and Film Association, and other five groups held an expanded preparatory meeting for the 36th Drama Festival at the New Licha Hotel at 2:00 PM yesterday afternoon. Representatives from Pan Gongzhan, Gu Yuxiu, Xiong Foxi, Tian Han, Hong Shen, the Education Bureau, the Finance Bureau, the Police Bureau, the Garrison Command, the 23rd National Army and other representatives, as well as famous figures in the drama industry and reporters from various newspapers, more than 40 people in total, attended. Eight celebration measures were decided during the meeting, which are recorded below:

(1) A celebration meeting and tea party will be held at 10:00 AM on the morning of the 15th. The location will be determined by the Preparatory Committee. (2) Negotiate with the theater authorities to offer half-price tickets for all daytime performances on that day, and ask the Finance Bureau to exempt taxes. The tax-exempted donations will be used to provide relief to poor and sick artists. (3) From 12:00 PM to 5:00 PM on the 14th, borrow the Tianchan Stage to hold various large-scale drama performances and grand concerts, organized by representatives from the five groups of the Preparatory Committee, the Entertainment Association, the representatives of the Cinema Commercial Association, and Hong Shen and eight others.

Finally, it was decided that the five groups that convened the preparatory meeting, the Radio Broadcasting Association, the Cinema Commercial Association, representatives of the Entertainment Association, and Hong Shen and Tian Han would form a formal Preparatory Committee to handle various celebration matters.

Pei Yuanjun stated: He is from Danyang, engaged in silk factory and rayon business, living at 31 Dade Lane, Linsen West Road. The house there was purchased from Shi Zhaoguang in August of the 31st year of the Republic, with a price of 240,000 yuan in counterfeit currency, used by one family. The flower bed in the courtyard was originally there, and he did not know where the opium came from at all. However, during April and May of the 32nd year of the Republic, he had hired the gardener Zhou Asan to plant geraniums in the flower bed. Zhou discovered several pieces of black asphalt-like hard material, but he did not know what they were at the time, so he did not investigate further. He also stated that Zhou Asan had come twice before and after.

Shi Zhaoguang stated: He is 57 years old, engaged in architecture, living at 5 Lane 53, Anfu Road. On April 23rd of last year, he was detained for smoking opium and sentenced to three months of imprisonment. 31 Dade Lane was built at his own expense in the 18th year of the Republic. From January to April of the 19th year, it was rented to a Korean, and in August of the same year, it was rented to Ye Qinghe, known as the "Morphine King," who opened the National Pharmacy on Fourth Horse Road. Later, when a drug case occurred, he fled without a trace. The house was taken back for his own use. He lived there for one month in the 21st year of the Republic. In the 22nd year, it was rented to Wu Songgao of the Academia Sinica. After Wu vacated the lease, it was empty for half a year. Until June of the 31st year, it was sold to Pei Yuanjun. The flower bed in the house was built when the house was built and originally planted with two boxwoods. During his residence, he never discovered any opium or other items.

Zhou Asan stated: He is 47 years old, from Wuxi, engaged in gardening. The flower bed at 31 Dade Lane is three feet high and six feet in circumference. He was introduced to plant geraniums. At that time, a black hard block was excavated from the soil and handed over to Mr. Pei for identification. Because they both did not recognize it as opium, they thought it was waste, so they discarded it. The three all stated that they did not know where the opium in the flower bed came from. The gardener Zhou Asan even claimed that Yuanjun once discovered it, but ignored it because he did not recognize opium. The court then summoned Wang Ruihong, the judicial section chief of the Changshu Branch Bureau, to present the process of cracking the case. Wang stated: The details are all recorded in the investigation report. The first person to receive the secret report in this case was Deputy Director Zheng of the Inspection Office. The name of the informant cannot be announced temporarily.

### Number of Cars in Shanghai Exceeds 20,000

The reason for the recent shortage of gasoline in the city is due to the increase in the number of new cars. According to the person in charge of the Public Works Bureau, as of the end of December last year, the number of cars in the city was more than 19,000, but as of yesterday, it had increased to 20,836 in January. Among them, there are 2,132 military cars, 1,986 military trucks, 10 military motorcycles, 8,074 private cars, 2,912 private trucks, 100 commercial cars, 2,568 commercial trucks, 1,855 motorcycles, and 199 test vehicles. In the recent month, more than 500 new cars have been shipped from abroad, some of which have not yet been licensed. The import of new cars recently is indeed more than last year.

In addition, the Customs will order its subordinates to pay attention to prevent the import of illegal new cars. All new cars with a value exceeding 2,000 US dollars and incomplete documents will still not be allowed to be imported.

### The Factory Guidance Office Will Investigate Factories

Once the review and investigation of the outstanding cases previously applied for by various factories to the Shanghai District Industrial and Commercial Guidance Office of the Ministry of Economic Affairs is completed, the office will begin to continue its original factory investigation work. The main parts are divided into production and equipment. Materials are collected separately, forms are compiled and submitted to the ministry, and important references are made to the Shanghai production industry to understand the actual production quantity of each industry and analyze its distribution needs. For factories lacking raw materials, they can claim the accurate estimated standard in advance. According to the factories, there are more than 9,000 units, including more than 40 associations. The ones that were investigated and completed last year have reached more than 3,000 copies.

The court believed that the case was complicated and evidence still needed to be investigated, so it ordered a postponement for further inquiry. Pei Yuanjun and Zhou Asan were returned to custody, and Shi Zhaoguang was released on bail.

### Year-End Bonus for Truck Workers Has Been Resolved

[Report from This Newspaper] The problem of the year-end bonus for truck workers has been delayed until now, and it has been resolved. Labor and management have signed a settlement record. The principles are: (1) The year-end bonus for the 35th year of the Republic will be decided on an individual basis depending on the profit and loss of each trucking company.

### The Struggle for Work at Taikoo Wharf; The Mayor Personally Handles the Situation; Orders the Formation of a Review Committee; Foreman Zhou Ruisun Speaks Rudely; Immediately Detained and Sent to the Police Bureau for Investigation

[Report from This Newspaper] The dispute over workers fighting for work at the Taikoo Company Wharf was mediated by Mayor Wu yesterday noon, who summoned Chen Shanyu, the manager of the Taikoo Company's wharf warehouse, Zhou Ruisun, the foreman, and the personnel of the Social Affairs Bureau who were handling the case to the city government conference room. Chen Shanyu claimed that the foremen and laborers under his command and supervision were all people who had been serving at the company's wharf, not newly hired. Zhou Ruisun is not a foreman of the Taikoo Company, and has neither entered into a contracting contract with the company nor established any hire relationship.

Therefore, Zhou's claim to be an old worker seems to be incorrect. Zhou Ruisun insisted that he had served at the wharf for many years, and now he demanded that the more than one hundred workers under him still enter the wharf to work. Mayor Wu stated that the Social Affairs Bureau could send personnel to form a committee with the Taikoo Company, the Wharf Workers' Union, and Zhou Ruisun to jointly investigate and identify this group of workers. If they are indeed old workers, they will be registered and Chen Shanyu can employ and distribute work. If they are new workers, they will not be included in this case. Zhou Ruisun suddenly made an extraneous remark during the mediation, claiming that "Chen Shanyu has gold bars, so someone is helping him speak." Mayor Wu was extremely angry when he heard this, and immediately ordered Zhou Ruisun to be detained and sent to the police bureau for investigation, ordering him to produce solid evidence, otherwise he would not be released.

The struggle for work at the Taikoo Company Wharf has been in dispute for a long time. The Social Affairs Bureau issued an instruction on January 27th of the 35th year of the Republic, including a statement ordering Chen and Zhou to cooperate. On February 9th of the same year, Premier Song of the Executive Yuan issued a handwritten order to the Social Affairs Bureau, fearing that disputes would occur and affect Shanghai's materials, ordering the Social Affairs Bureau to transfer the order to Chen and Zhou to be jointly responsible for preventing theft. Regarding the point of cooperation, the instruction stated that "whether Chen and Zhou can cooperate in the future is another issue."

Review Work Yields No Results

[Report from This Newspaper] After Mayor Wu ordered the two parties to form a special investigation committee to identify the workers in the Taikoo Wharf work dispute, Cao Demo and Zhu Bianjun of the Mediation Section of the Social Affairs Bureau, Ling Xingyin, the section chief of the Huangpu Branch Bureau, and Mao Jun, the representative of Taikoo, conducted the review work at the Taikoo Company's office at around 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon. The Huangpu Branch Bureau also sent two patrol officers, Xu Jianzhong and Song Yongfang, leading many police officers to the scene for security. Chen Shanyu, the foreman, also attended. Zhou Ruisun was detained and sent to the police bureau for investigation because he made rude remarks and slandered government officials during the mediation at the city government, so Zhou's party was represented by Zhou Chengxiang, Sun Wenfu, Hou Mengfang, and He Changzhi in the review meeting. Chen Shanyu and Hou Mengfang, the representative of Zhou's party, had another dispute during the review. Hou insisted that the two parties must cooperate in their work and the workers cannot be taken by Chen. Chen believed that Hou's opinion completely overturned the original intention of the mayor's mediation, causing the workers of the bureau not to be willing to accept the review, and it dispersed without results at around 5:00 PM. According to Cao and Zhu of the Social Affairs Bureau, the method of review must be instructed by the mayor again. Whether the review will continue today is still uncertain.

### New and Old Workers Dispute at Datong Shipping Company

[Our Report] A large group of old workers, including Li Alin, gathered at the Datong Shipping Company on the Bund of Jinling Road at approximately 5:45 PM yesterday, demanding reinstatement. The new workers firmly refused, leading to a dispute. Hao Yunpeng, the group leader of the Datong Joint Transportation Office, arrived at the scene and took the eight leading figures, including Li Alin, to the police station for mediation.

### Disputes Arise Over Unpaid Wages; Rubber Factory Petitions to Suspend Operations

[Our Report] The Shenhe Rubber Factory previously petitioned the Bureau of Social Affairs, proposing to suspend operations at its second factory. After summoning both labor and management to the bureau for questioning, it was learned that this action was not due to losses, but rather because the management was dissatisfied with a small number of workers who demanded payment of overdue wages. The Bureau of Social Affairs believes that the management should not use the suspension of operations as a means of dealing with workers. If a few unscrupulous workers are deliberately causing trouble, the factory can petition the Bureau of Social Affairs for handling.

[Another Report] The Wuxi Hengfeng Dyeing and Weaving Factory at 140 Binlang Road recently dismissed three workers, including Ma Bingyuan. The management only agreed to provide severance pay equivalent to fifteen days' wages, which the workers firmly refused. The conditions differed too greatly, and after unsuccessful mediation by the union, a petition has been submitted to the Bureau of Social Affairs for handling.

### Demand Surges, Transportation Can't Keep Up; Gasoline Supply Disrupted Again Yesterday

[Our Report] The gasoline supply in the city has again become disrupted recently. Yesterday afternoon, the "Gu Pai" gasoline station even temporarily suspended sales. Various sectors have speculated about this situation. Some say it is related to rumors of an impending exchange rate adjustment, while others say it is because the city's oil reserves are depleted. However, according to inquiries by reporters to those in charge of various gasoline companies, they all claimed there was no relationship. The shortage at gas stations is purely due to the recent psychological effect on the general public, which has led to a surge in demand. Gas stations that usually supply 500 gallons per day are now often required to supply more than 1,000 gallons. Therefore, transportation cannot keep up, leading to shortages. This is purely a temporary phenomenon, and normal conditions will soon be restored.

### Old Woman Claims Robbery to Evade Debt

[Our Report] A certain old woman reported a robbery to the Hongkou Sub-bureau around 7 PM the night before. She identified herself as Li Hai (62 years old, from Wuxi), residing at No. 9, Lane 321, Wuchang Road, Hongkou. She claimed that she had just returned home from Suzhou when she was ambushed by two robbers lying in wait at the entrance of the lane. They intercepted her, robbed her of a net bag containing three million yuan in legal tender, and tied her up with rope, throwing her to the ground. They also stuffed her mouth with newspapers to prevent her from calling for help. Later, a neighbor came out and helped her up and released her. She came to the bureau to request an investigation. Section Chief Shi, along with patrol officers Jiang Tianfu and Jiang Darren, went to the scene of the incident to investigate and discovered that her report was false. Under strict questioning, Li confessed the truth. She had previously borrowed money from others and traveled between the Beijing-Shanghai railway as a peddler, but she had lost everything. Creditors were demanding repayment, and she was unable to cope. She came up with the idea of falsely claiming she was going to Suzhou to borrow money on the afternoon before, but instead spent the night sleeping at the North Railway Station. She then returned to her residence, claiming she had been robbed, hoping to delay her creditors and find a way to repay them. The sub-bureau, due to her disruption of public order, has scheduled a report to the judicial authorities for review.

### Ash Pond Mistaken for Cesspool; Limestone Business Owner Detained; Investigator Suspected of False Reporting; Eight Senators Move to Investigate Strictly; Third District Public Works Management Office Responds that it was a Typographical Error

[Our Report] Eight city senators, Xie Dahuang, Chen Boliang, Huang Bingquan, and others, have filed a temporary emergency motion requesting a thorough investigation into the alleged false reporting by a city Public Works Bureau investigator, which resulted in the infringement of a citizen's personal freedom. According to the report of Senator Xie and others: "According to Zhang Nairen, a representative of the residents of the Ninth District: There is an ash pond in front of the Jiankang Limestone Business at the intersection of Anhe Temple Road and Huashan Road. The Public Works Bureau, based on the investigator's report, identified it as a cesspool placed on the street. The Changning District Police Sub-bureau detained Huang Tingsheng, the owner of the business, without asking the reason, and sentenced him to fourteen days of detention. After the district representative pleaded with the police bureau to send personnel to verify that it was not a cesspool, they still detained him for one day before releasing him because the Public Works Bureau had already issued a document. It is already strange that the investigator cannot distinguish between ash and feces, and even if it were feces placed on the street, it would be a matter of hygiene, why not notify the Health Bureau to investigate and ban it? It is suspected that they attempted to solicit bribes without success and used false accusations in retaliation. It is extremely necessary to conduct a thorough investigation to protect the personal freedom of the people."

After the Public Works Bureau's Third District Public Works Management Office investigated the case, it responded: "The Jiankang Brick and Ash Business at the intersection of Linsen West Road and Panyu Road had piled up brick materials and set up an ash pond on the sidewalk, obstructing traffic. We have repeatedly ordered them to move it, but they have not complied. We have often reported to the bureau and forwarded it to the two police headquarters, ordering the Changning Road Sub-bureau to ban it. Later, this office sent another letter to the Changning Road Sub-bureau for banning. Unexpectedly, the editor mistakenly wrote "ash pond" as "cesspool." However, the documents submitted to the bureau by this office and the main bureau, which were forwarded to the two police bureaus, all stated "ash pond," not "cesspool." Moreover, the document specified the intersection of Linsen West Road and Panyu Road, not the intersection of Anhe Temple Road and Huashan Road, which shows that the investigators did not make any false reports. In addition to issuing a major demerit to the editor to show punishment, this office is not aware of the detention of the owner of the Jiankang Limestone Business at the intersection of Anhe Temple Road and Huashan Road by the Changning Road Sub-bureau. We are reporting to request verification."

### City Council Reviews Budget, Inspects Various Bureaus and Offices of the Municipal Government

### Finance Bureau Explains Again the Valuation Method for House Tax

[Our Report] Regarding the assessment standards for the autumn house tax and municipal construction tax in the 35th year, Director Gu of the Finance Bureau has repeatedly explained this at the Council meetings. Because some citizens are still unclear about the assessment method, they inquired with the City Council. After the Council inquired with Director Gu, Director Gu gave another explanation: The house tax and municipal construction tax in the autumn of the 235th year are calculated by multiplying the rental value determined in the 26th year after re-evaluation, not according to the actual rent or original assessed price at that time. The figures listed on the former Public Works Bureau's general tax ticket are actually the actual rental figures used by the former Public Works Bureau at that time, which is different from the assessed rental value based on by the Finance Bureau. The house tax and municipal construction tax for the winter of the 35th year will still be assessed and collected according to the autumn method.

### Resumption Island Case Postponed and Ended; Executive Yuan Will Go to Guangdong Again for Investigation

### A Coat and Two Pairs of Overshoes; Prostitute Duped by Clever Scam

[Our Report] The Lin Wenyuan brothel at No. 4, Fuxiang Lane, Guangxi Road, received a call the night before from a Shen-surnamed traveler in room 426 of the Oriental Hotel, requesting a prostitute to accompany him. The brothel sent two prostitutes, but both were rejected for their ordinary looks. Finally, Chen Aying (19 years old, from Taicang), who had not been in the business for long, was sent, and the Shen traveler was finally satisfied. He immediately paid 30,000 yuan for the night. After a night of pleasure, the Shen traveler, who claimed to be named Guo Bin, from Nanjing, and currently working in a military agency in Nanjing, said that because he was still single, he had been frequenting brothels for several years, hoping to find a partner. He said that after seeing her today, he wished to spend the rest of his life with her, and to show his sincerity, he agreed to buy her a fur coat first tomorrow. The woman believed him to be true. After getting up yesterday morning, they went out together. The woman was wearing a old and outdated Haihu velvet coat. However, with the thought that she was about to transform from a goddess into a military officer's wife, the woman was overjoyed that her old Haihu velvet coat would be renewed. When the couple arrived at the Kuifa Barber Shop at No. 396, Henan North Road, the traveler said again: "To try on new clothes, one must look radiant, so please have your hair permed first." The woman agreed. When the barber started using electric tongs, the Shen traveler suddenly took off the woman's Haihu velvet coat, saying that he would go to the fashion company first to choose a size with this old coat. At the same time, he instructed the shop apprentice to go with him. The woman still had no doubt. After the Shen traveler left, he and the apprentice went to the Baoshan Road Qiujiang Road No. 119 department store and bought two pairs of tall men's overshoes, priced at 150,000 yuan. When paying, he suddenly said to the store clerks: "Because I left in a hurry, I didn't bring cash. Can you send someone with this barber shop apprentice to my wife to get the money?" The store clerks, seeing that the visitor was calm and the apprentice was unaware of the inside story, returned to the store with the department store staff, and this highly skilled con artist took the Haihu velvet coat and two pairs of tall overshoes and calmly walked away. When the department store staff went to the barber shop to ask Chen for the overshoes payment, the scam was exposed. The enraged Chen reported to the North Railway Station Police Sub-bureau, requesting an investigation.

If the cough is not frequent, occurring every few minutes with three or four coughs, and the cough is moist with balanced breathing and does not interfere with sleep, it will definitely not affect their health and will not cause changes in the course of the measles. The physiological function of coughing and choking is to eliminate obstacles in the respiratory system, expelling them from the body through the outburst of coughing. Coughing and choking in children with measles also has the function of assisting the eruption of rashes. If it is not too severe, it is beneficial and not harmful, so there is no need to use cough suppressants to eliminate it. If the coughing and choking are frequent, and the cough is not moist, or if the throat is sore and painful due to excessive coughing, and the voice is hoarse, or if the stomach is shaken due to severe coughing, causing nausea and vomiting, the situation may seem very tense. However, the eruption of rashes does not change because of this, and if the breathing is even and there are no signs of shortness of breath or rapid breathing, there is still no major problem with proper treatment. If the coughing and choking are accompanied by rapid breathing and nasal flaring, and the coughing persists after the rashes have appeared, these are all adverse signs and should be carefully noted!

Colds can cause coughing, so children with measles should avoid wind and cold. However, excessive care, such as wrapping the sick child tightly in heavy bedding or placing a stove in the room, causing external heat to force inward, resulting in coughing due to panting, is also often seen. Dense smoke is most likely to irritate the respiratory tract and exacerbate coughing and choking. It is common to see that in cramped rooms, where many people gather, the air is already very foul. Entering such a room often causes dizziness and nausea. If dense smoke is used for fumigation, it is not advisable to use this method, especially for children with severe coughing and choking. According to customs, families with measles do not "heat the wok with oil" when cooking, in order to avoid the stimulation of oily fumes and prevent an increase in coughing and choking.

The occurrence of measles is often induced by colds. For those who also have a cough, boil a few scallions, crushed, into thin porridge and drink it. This can relieve the cold and also help the measles to erupt, achieving two things with one action. If the cough is caused by heat, most will have a red face and rapid breathing, and the measles rashes will be dense and bright red. Cooling drinks, such as sugarcane juice and pear juice, are suitable. The degree of coldness of the drink and whether to take it warm or cold should be determined based on the degree of heat. It is also good to grind almonds with water, extract the juice, and drink it. If the heat is severe, it will be dry, and the body fluids will be consumed, so those who cough due to dryness will have a dry, non-moist cough, and the tongue will be light red. It is especially suitable to give them sweet and cool sugarcane juice and pear juice. For those who cough with a lot of phlegm, the key is to dispel the phlegm. Grind radish into juice, add three to five drops of dried ginger juice, and take it warm. Be careful when using it for children with measles who have loose stools. Those who cough with a lot of phlegm should not eat too much oily food. In the early stages of measles, oily food should be prohibited. Even in the later stages of measles, when the rashes have subsided and the appetite has increased, oily foods should still be prohibited for those who cough with a lot of phlegm.

### Asthma and Wheezing

— Chen Cunren

Recently, the cold weather has made the most common ailments colds and flu. Severe cases may be persistent coughs (chronic bronchitis in Western medicine) or asthma and wheezing (bronchial asthma in Western medicine). These are not short-term epidemics. Those afflicted often suffer from them and experience great pain. To seek a cure, they must pay attention to treatment methods over a long period, which vary from person to person, place to place, and profession to profession. Therefore, those who cure these stubborn ailments have experience superior to that of ordinary doctors!

Childhood asthma, wheezing, shortness of breath, and panting are all symptoms of the same condition. Some are inherited, and some are caused by cold, lung weakness, or infection. Inherited cases are the most common: often, several siblings, though with varying degrees of severity, all have the condition. Sometimes, only one sibling is affected, or it may skip a generation. In general, if parents have this condition, they must be most careful to prevent their children from catching a cold. If it breaks out once, it will easily occur every winter. They must also prevent specific odors from affecting them. Overeating salty foods can cause "salty asthma," and eating large amounts of sweets can cause "sweet asthma." Suddenly exposed to oily fumes can make the trachea uncomfortable, leading to "oily asthma," or it can be caused by ash, dust, or feathers sticking to the trachea. These are all patterns of attacks in childhood, with salty asthma and oily wheezing being the most common! Parents with asthma should carefully avoid these things for their children! But ephedra and asarum can easily cure oily asthma in children at the beginning, and dried snail, pumpkin stem, mantis ootheca, and evodia rutaecarpa can cure salty asthma in children within three years. These are all proven formulas!

It is easier to treat in childhood. The most important condition is that daily life must maintain a certain level of warmth. In winter, one cannot go outside, and the indoor climate should be kept at an average of 65 degrees. Therefore, it is necessary to have them study at home for the first one or two years of onset. If it has been more than three years, it is easy to become a lifelong condition, making it difficult to treat.

Middle Age. For middle-aged asthma sufferers, the cause may no longer be relevant. The most important thing to seek treatment is prevention and prompt treatment of the initial attack. What is prevention? In the summer, buy about ten pounds of old ginger, add a little water, mash it to extract the juice, and drain a bowl of yellow liquid. Then, use cotton to soak up the ginger juice, dry it in the sun, and soak up the ginger juice again. Do this three times, then spread the yellow cotton flat and make small cotton vests. Wear one of them in the fall. They are uniquely warm and can effectively protect the lungs from cold and prevent asthma. This is a method that many people have experienced.

When autumn arrives, be most careful to prevent cold winds from directly affecting the lungs when the first autumn wind rises. Asthma is most likely to occur. In late autumn or early winter, immediately consult a doctor and take astragalus membranaceus, aconite, and ginger preparations for prevention. Once you catch a cold, you should immediately take ephedra and asarum preparations. The sooner, the better, because if you delay for a day, phlegm and fluids will surge and flow into the lungs. The more phlegm there is, the worse the asthma will be. When phlegm enters the lungs, breathing is not smooth. Asthmatics use it to assist breathing and to agitate the phlegm, turning it into a bubble state so that it is easier to cough up. Therefore, asthmatic coughs during the day often produce several bowls full of phlegm, which are initially bubbles like thin phlegm, but become calm overnight and completely turn into liquid.

Asthma most fears unregulated air. It is not suitable to live in an extremely warm, stove-heated room, nor is it suitable to go out into the wind and rain occasionally. Wu Tiecheng suffered from high blood pressure and asthma and took refuge in Shanghai, sitting under a glass awning to bask in the sun and keep warm, which was a good strategy. When spring warms up, the disease is easily cured.

Asthma is cured when it is transformed by heat. Thin phlegm becomes thick phlegm, and clear white phlegm becomes sticky yellow phlegm. When it can be coughed up easily, the recovery period is not far off. Therefore, taking warm and hot medicines is most likely to promote recovery.

Dr. Chen Kehui's invention of ephedrine from ephedra made him famous worldwide and achieved a temporary effect. The whole world considered it a good treatment, but there is still no radical cure. However, using ephedra with aconite and lepidium seed in traditional Chinese medicine has the possibility of a radical cure! (1) Use it as much as possible during the first attack each winter, which can be cured. After recovery, it is absolutely necessary to regulate the temperature at home, avoid cold and wind, and wait for the arrival of spring. In the second winter and early autumn when it is cold, you still need to regulate the temperature at home. Although this is difficult to do in practice, you should know that if you get infected for three to five years, you will definitely get sick every winter for a month or two, which is truly a lifelong ailment. (2) After the attack in the first (second) winter, as soon as spring warms up, you must take medicine to regulate and accelerate the treatment of phlegm, warmth, and shortness of breath to prevent it from becoming a chronic bronchitis, so that there is a risk of recurrence in summer and autumn.

Elderly. The elderly are weaker in qi and blood, and their yang qi is weak. The so-called fire qi is gradually insufficient, just like the firing part of a machine has less power, and the whole body feels insufficient in yang qi. The ability to transport and transform is reduced, and the ability to promote is weaker. The food and water consumed often cannot be warmed and transported, leading to wheezing and accumulation of water in the trachea, brewing into phlegm. This kind of phlegm is cold in nature, and what is coughed up is white and foamy like crab roe. After coughing up, what sinks is all liquid. When not coughed up, it gathers in the lungs and stomach, sticking together and not dissolving. Over time, it accumulates more and more, and the phlegm becomes harder, eventually forming lumps, which are medically known as "phlegm-fluid," hidden in the lungs and not dissipating for a long time. The lungs lose their ability to breathe healthily, and there is a gurgling sound all day long, and the phlegm is coughed up continuously. When winter comes and the north wind rises, the cold from the outside makes it even less able to warm and transport water, producing even more phlegm. A slight cold will cause a cough, which is further obstructed by phlegm, causing the qi mechanism to be reversed, resulting in wheezing and asthma. The phlegm in the throat gurgles like a "sawing sound." However, during the day, the phlegm lump is still in the lower part of the stomach or lungs. If you lie flat at night, the phlegm-fluid spreads over the upper part of the lungs and stomach, and the qi mechanism is even more obstructed, making the asthma worse. Wheezing makes it impossible to close your eyes and even impossible to lie flat. In addition, due to the decline of yang qi in old age, if the person has a kidney deficiency, there will be a state of kidney not receiving qi. The shortness of breath during asthma is indescribable, and the qi in the dantian has no ability to absorb it, as if it makes the person unable to catch their breath. The suffering is truly unbearable. All people over forty years old often have this condition in winter. The symptoms are varied as described above, but the source of the disease is the decline of yang qi, the inability to warm and transport, and the lack of fire in the body!

The treatment for this disease lies entirely in the method of "strengthening the fire and warming the yang." Stopping wheezing, moistening the lungs, resolving phlegm, and calming cough are not the fundamental ways to treat this disease. In autumn, it is advisable to take about twenty doses of warm tonic medicines, or often take "aconite fried rice flour," with two taels of aconite powder and eight taels of fried rice flour (i.e., ordinary rice fried and ground into powder), mixed evenly. Those with mild conditions can take it in thirty days, and those with severe conditions can take it in fourteen days, once a day, either dry or mixed with warm water, all of which have very effective results! Except for teenagers with phlegm-fire coughs who have a history of hemoptysis, elderly asthma sufferers often take this powder, which has miraculous results. When winter comes, take "strengthening the fire and warming the yang" medicines again. Seek medical advice for the prescription of such medicines, which may include aconite, cinnamon, ginger, ephedra, and lepidium seed, in order to fundamentally treat this disease. Otherwise, the root of the disease will become deeply entrenched year by year, becoming more and more severe, which is not advisable. However, if one is unable to afford medical treatment and medicine, there is a prescription called "Jin Gui Shen Qi Wan," which is effective to take three qian every day.

### Chinese Medicine

— Cen Zhiliang

Although science is flourishing in the world, Chinese medicine is still popular among the Chinese people and can be sold abroad, without being eliminated by the times. This is because the efficacy of the medicine is remarkable, and it does not pursue superficial and quick effects for a temporary solution. It is also good at treating combined and complex diseases, as well as multiple contradictory and mixed symptoms. It also has no side effects or drastic qualities. Plant products are more common than mineral products, which is suitable for the physique of the Chinese people. It enriches the country and benefits the people, improves health, and promoting Chinese medicine is the responsibility of the Chinese people!

### After Quitting Smoking

— Zhang Ruwei

Since the victory, the ban on smoking has been strict. Most people who have addictions want to quit as soon as possible to avoid punishment and become new citizens. However, there are many people whose bodies become stronger after quitting, but there are also not a few people whose weak bodies develop diseases as a result. People take health as the first priority, and smokers are no exception. I am taking the liberty of offering a few words about the conditioning methods after quitting smoking for your consideration. People who quit smoking and have a yang deficiency will definitely see neurasthenia, night sweats, seminal emission, forgetfulness, and worry. They should often seek medical treatment and take various tonics and longan lotus seed soup. People who have a yin deficiency after quitting smoking will definitely see palpitations, restlessness, constipation, irregular periods, weakness of the limbs, and tearing. They should also seek medical treatment and conditioning, and often eat eggs, black tea, and red dates as snacks. There are also people with both yin and yang deficiencies and special symptoms. It is safer to use traditional Chinese medicine for conditioning. If you condition yourself properly within half a year after quitting, there will be no future troubles. In general, people who quit smoking replace smoking with alcohol, and get drunk every day. They can gain weight at the time, but the nerves become weaker day by day. As a result, the abdomen will become large, or shortness of breath will appear, or the spleen will leak, or it will turn into kidney disease, edema, and bloating. These symptoms cannot be prevented. People who quit smoking should pay attention to them.

### Early Stage of Damp-Warm Disease

— Chen Zhichao

The early stage of damp-warm disease is all caused by careless diet, fatigue, and exposure to cold. The symptoms are fever, aversion to cold, no sweat, headache, heavy body, chest tightness, dull stomach, fatigue of the limbs, greasy mouth coating, white tongue coating, not much thirst, and soft and rapid pulse. At this time, the damp-warm disease has already formed, but it is still mild. If it can be conditioned properly, it will soon recover. If things are delayed or the treatment is not correct or the conditioning is not complete, the disease will progress and become a major problem.

Most of those with severe damp-warm disease are people from the middle and lower classes, who either rely on their physical strength and do not pay attention, or are trapped by economic difficulties and have no ability to condition and take medicine. They still work while suffering from cold and heat, which is common.

For the early stage of damp-warm disease, use Huoxiang Zhengqi Tang (Agastache rugosa, Magnolia officinalis, Pinellia ternata, Eupatorium fortunei, Perilla frutescens, Angelica dahurica, Amomum villosum, Citrus reticulata, Stir-fried Shen Qu, Poria cocos) plus Forsythia suspensa, Talcum, Benincasa hispida, and Akebia trifoliata. For those with fullness in the epigastrium and abdomen, loose stools, red urine, and aversion to cold that has not subsided, use Cinnamomum cassia, Agastache rugosa, Eupatorium fortunei, Magnolia officinalis, Aucklandia lappa, Areca catechu, Poria cocos, Polyporus umbellatus, and Talcum to resolve the evil in both the exterior and interior.

### Differentiation of Measles, Rubella, Smallpox, and Eruptions

— Zhang Zanchen

The most important thing to note in the symptoms of skin rashes, apart from the color, is the difference between spots, eruptions and swelling. Conventionally, any pathological condition that occurs on the surface of the skin is collectively referred to as a rash. For clarity, any red spots, whether dense or sparse (such as in measles or scarlet fever), and anything that forms a granular particle (such as in smallpox or chickenpox), is classified as an eruption. Anything that is raised in lumps, like broad beans or cloud flakes, is classified as a spot. A list is given below:

Measles Measles, also known as Sha Zi, is when the fever rises again when the rash appears. The site where the rash appears is initially visible behind the earlobes and on the face, especially around the lips. Next, it appears on the chest, back, abdomen, and limbs in order. Initially, they are sparse red spots without a halo, looking like flea bites, gradually becoming dense and translucent, with a slightly purplish-red color.

Scarlet Fever When scarlet fever rashes appear, the fever also rises again, lingering for four or five days before receding. The order in which the rash appears is from the neck, chest, back, abdomen, and buttocks. It spreads throughout the body in one or two days, with less on the face and none on the nose, lips, or chin. Initially, there is still space between the skin, but after half a day or a day, they gradually merge together. The inner side of the thighs and upper arms is particularly dense. Upon close inspection, only tiny, dot-like eruptions are visible. In the less dense areas, one can still recognize tiny, needle-head-sized, raised eruptions, all red, like erysipelas.

Rubella The symptoms of rubella are very mild. The rash appears at the same time as the fever, or one or two days later. They appear as small dots, red in color, larger than scarlet fever rashes and smaller than measles rashes, slightly round or oval in shape. They are not as raised as measles rashes, nor as dense as scarlet fever. Initially, they are seen on the head, and in half a day or a day, they spread throughout the body.

Smallpox After the smallpox rash appears, the body temperature drops at the same time. The rash initially appears on the forehead, nose, and ears, followed by the face, gradually extending to the back, upper limbs, abdomen, and finally to the lower limbs and feet. A special feature is that no rash appears in the armpits. Initially, it starts as a small rash and quickly turns into a pea-sized, round, shiny, and glossy nodule.

### Thoughts on Returning from the National Assembly

— Ding Zhongying

I attended the National Assembly in Nanjing and visited various places. I know for certain that national medical colleges and pharmaceutical colleges are springing up like bamboo shoots after the rain. The teaching materials they are equipped with are all from Europe and America, and there is not a single item about our country's medicines and prescriptions. Diseases have local diseases, regional diseases, and national habit symptoms. It is inappropriate not to adopt the nation's inherent skills and therapeutic materials and to make the teaching materials of medical colleges have no national component.

### Strong Local Sales, High Prices Outside the Area, Gold Prices Rise Again by More Than 300,000, US Dollars Follow, Hong Kong Tickets Also Rise

[Report from this Newspaper] Yesterday, the Central Bank's supply of funds was reduced again, and the buying interest was even stronger, creating a high price. After noon, a slight control was added, and there was a slight recovery. The opening price was 4.43 million to 4.45 million. With many floating profits, they took the opportunity to sell and immediately reported downstream, retreating into 4.4 million, and the low price once retreated to 4.35 million. But then it still struggled. After 10 o'clock, after the Central Bank allocated 1,100 bars at a price of 4.39 million, the buying spree started again. The 4.4 million mark and the 4.5 million mark were soon broken. The supply side was even more helpless, and the pressure was unprecedented. People's hearts were greatly panicked, and the scramble to buy was even more urgent. At noon, the 4.7 million mark was broken, and the exchange once reached as high as 4.81 million before slightly falling back. At exactly 2 o'clock, the next-day delivery was opened, and the Central Bank immediately increased control, once falling as low as 4.62 million, but the selling interest was very temporary and returned to 4.76 million before stabilizing slightly. As a result, the closing price rose again by 310,000 compared to the previous one. Jewelry was listed at 490,000, and silver dollars also rose to the fourth level. The interest rate for hidden discounts was still flat, from about 1.5 to 1.8.

Foreign currencies also rose sharply yesterday. The open market for US dollars opened at 7,900 to 8,000 in the morning, rising rapidly to a high price of 8,500 to 8,800 at noon. Although the price of gold fell slightly in the afternoon, the market for banknotes did not change much. As a result, the closing price rose by 700 yuan compared to the previous one. Hong Kong tickets also started a fierce buying spree. There were not many chips, and the price rose from around 1,550 yuan to 1,700 yuan. As a result, it also rose by 180 yuan. In addition to Hong Kong telegraphic transfers rising to 1,600 yuan, Indian remittances were 1,950 yuan, and British remittances were 25,600 yuan. All were in demand but not supplied.

### Observations on the Gold Market

Over the past two days, gold prices have soared. This reporter made a special visit to a leader in the gold industry to inquire about the reasons. According to him, the recent surge in the gold market is solely due to robust actual sales, with a particularly large number of shipments to other locations, both domestically and abroad. It is estimated that since the Lunar New Year, the daily turnover of gold bars in the market has consistently been around three to four thousand bars. Among these, aside from the one to twelve hundred bars sold by various silver shops, the majority flows to various parts of the country. The supply of these large amounts of gold bars mostly comes from the Central Bank. However, in the past two days, the Central Bank has rarely sold gold in the afternoon, apart from the one thousand-plus allotted in the morning. Yesterday afternoon, all sales were halted. However, the market demand was extremely high, causing prices to skyrocket. The future trend will still depend on market demand and the supply situation from the Central Bank.

### Public Bonds Show Slight Rise

Public bonds showed some activity yesterday, with approximately one million yuan in transactions. Unified Bonds C traded at 1860 yuan, while the 604 series saw supply and fell to 1760 yuan. The 552 series advanced, fluctuating between 1820 yuan and 1850 yuan at the close, resulting in a comparison to the previous close of A and B flat, Unified Bond C up 30 yuan, Unified Bond D up 100 yuan, and Unified Bond E up 50 yuan.

### Sugar Price Uptrend Gains Momentum

Green, red, and white sugars all saw upward movement, with increases ranging from 17,000 to 34,000 yuan. The guild set the price for spot medium white sugar at 152,000 yuan, rising to 158,000 yuan and reaching 165,000 yuan in the afternoon. Warehouse receipts peaked at 153,000 yuan, later falling to 149,000 yuan. 24 Crude White was priced at 210,000 yuan, Four-and-a-Half Cart White at 225,000 yuan, Three-and-a-Half Army White at 185,000 to 190,000 yuan, Shunde Green at 100,450 yuan, Shantou Green at 100,678 yuan, and Branch Red at 125,000 yuan. A total of several thousand bags were traded, along with 300+ baskets of chemical white sugar at 160,000 to 155,000 yuan and several hundred bags of Diao Green at 100,500 yuan.

### Tea Market Sentiment Remains Firm

Recently, the tea market has shown a frequently positive trend. The reason for this is the significant fluctuations in gold and commodity prices, which have caused market sentiment to strengthen. Holders of goods are even more reluctant to sell than before, leading to a decline in supply. On the buyer side, in addition to continued inquiries from various export firms, local shops, noting the sustained sales at their storefronts, are also showing interest in replenishing their stock. As a result, there is a growing situation of too many monks and not enough porridge, leading to insufficient supply. Transactions are sparse, like stars at dawn, and selling prices are becoming increasingly sharp.

### Gold Price in Nanjing Exceeds 500,000

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 4th] The asking price for gold in Nanjing is 500,400, and the bid price is 466,000. The asking price for U.S. dollars is 8,500, and the bid price is 8,400.

### Reduced Price of British Silver

Agence France-Presse, London, 3rd. Officials have announced that the official price of pure silver has been reduced from 55.5 pence per ounce to 44 pence per ounce. According to well-informed sources, the purpose of this measure by British authorities is to bring British silver prices closer to those in New York. During the war, Britain borrowed a large amount of silver from the United States under the Lend-Lease Act, which must be repaid in the coming years.

### Allocation Extension Leads to Gold Price Hike, Silk Soars

Yesterday, the gold price soared, and silk prices followed, all reaching new highs. 120 Oriental Rayon with Luster traded at 4.15 million yuan in the morning, reaching 4.20 million yuan by noon, and another 100,000 yuan higher in the afternoon. Gaoshan and others traded at 4.05 million yuan in the morning and asked for 4.20 million yuan in the afternoon. 150 Luster and 75 Semi-Luster were even asking for 6 million yuan, refusing to sell. Yesterday, stimulated by the gold price, market sentiment was unusually excited. Furthermore, the Central Trust Bureau's extension of the 21st allocation period led to an opportunity to raise prices, soaring upwards. Due to limited actual sales, the factory-direct market was relatively calm. C-grade was asking for 5.55 million yuan, and D-grade 5.50 million yuan, roughly 50,000 to 100,000 yuan higher than the previous day. Gan Jing was offered at 4.2 million yuan for five bundles and 4 million yuan for another bundle. Very few transactions occurred. Silk goods were affected by the soaring raw material prices, and trading was quite active, so factory prices have all been raised. Meiya bedspreads were asking for as much as 400,000 yuan, with transactions at 350,000 yuan. Dachenge crepe sold for 13,500 yuan, and miscellaneous brands traded at 2,500 yuan. Artificial silk bedspreads rose sharply by 50,000 yuan. Sheng Hangzhou goods also increased, with Sheng goods rising by 2-3,000 yuan to 5,000 yuan per piece, and Hangzhou goods by 200 yuan per tael.

### Central Bank President Bei Zuyi Summoned to Nanjing Yesterday

[Our Report] The President of the Central Bank, Bei Zuyi, was summoned yesterday at 12:30 pm and hastily departed for Nanjing at 1:30 pm. Accompanying him were Luo Jishi, Economic Advisor to the Executive Yuan, and Secretary Lu Dingzhong. The mission of this trip is unclear, but it is widely believed to be related to stabilizing the current economic and financial situation in Shanghai.

### Export Promotion Committee Changes to Preparatory Meeting

The Official Establishment Date Awaits Bei's Return to Shanghai

[Our Report] The Export Promotion Committee was originally scheduled to hold its inaugural meeting at the Central Bank yesterday at 3:30 pm. However, due to the temporary departure of Committee Chairman Zu-yi to Nanjing, it was temporarily changed to a preparatory meeting. Liu Gongyun, Lin Fengbao, Shen Xirui, Jin Shixuan (Counselor of the Ministry of Transportation), Ma Baozhi (Director of Agriculture and Forestry), Yan Jia-gan (Director of Finance of Taiwan Province), Zhang Silv, and Central Bank Economic Advisor Mike, among others, attended and discussed until around 6 pm before adjourning. It is reported that the discussion focused on how to cooperate with the Ministries of Chen Lin Transportation to increase the production of export goods on the one hand and to solve transportation problems on the other. The official establishment meeting will be determined after Chairman Bei Zuyi returns to Shanghai.

### Edible Oil Joint Distribution Office Distributes Edible Oil by District

[Our Report] The Shanghai Edible Oil Joint Distribution Office began handling the distribution of edible oil in the city, Pudong, and suburban areas yesterday. It is estimated that there are more than 400 retail stores in each distribution area. Each store is still allocated one barrel each of soybean oil and sesame oil, each barrel weighing 350 catties. The total allocation volume is estimated to be over 3,000 dan. The allocation price is 180,000 yuan per dan for soybean oil and 165,000 yuan per dan for sesame oil. It is hoped that the distribution procedures will be completed today. It is also learned that the Central Trust Bureau sold 2,000 dan of Northeastern soybeans at a flat price yesterday, so the soybean price stopped rising, and the oil price also tended to stabilize.

### After Large-Scale Sales and Strict Supervision, the Rice Market Has Gradually Stabilized. Businesses Exceeding the Price Limit Have Been Warned. The Market for Miscellaneous Grains and Oil Cakes Is Also Gradually Weakening.

[Our Report] Due to the recent high rice prices, the Bureau of Social Affairs sent personnel to inspect various districts and supervise transactions in the north and south markets. However, because the negotiated price on January 10th was far from the black market price, and the amount of rice shipped to Shanghai after the Lunar New Year was extremely small, most rice merchants were reluctant to release their goods, except for the Xian rice sold by the Bureau of Social Affairs. There were almost no transactions in the market. Many rice shops secretly hoarded white japonica rice, unwilling to supply it. The black market price still hovered around 90,000 yuan. Some vendors, taking advantage of the high prices, sold their stocks, and the price has slightly declined. It is generally expected that the rice price in the city has reached its peak, and large quantities of rice from various rice-producing areas will soon arrive. Moreover, the large quantity of national rice allocated by the China National Cereals, Oils and Foodstuffs Import and Export Corporation has been shipped from Wuxi and will soon be sold in the city, so the rice price is expected to return to normal in the coming days.

Yesterday, the Bureau of Social Affairs continued to sell 3,430 bags of Siamese rice and over 800 bags of soybeans in the market. It also found that a total of 52 distributors in various districts had exceeded the negotiated price. Chief Ji of the Bureau brought the list of these distributors who violated the negotiated price to the Municipal Government at 5 pm to ask the Mayor what to do. Afterwards, Mayor Wu told reporters that, according to the rice merchants, the white japonica rice was mostly purchased at high black market prices before the Siamese rice was sold, so the situation was understandable. However, they have been given a final warning. From today onwards, if any further instances of exceeding the negotiated price are found, they will be severely dealt with.

Yesterday, the total rice arrival in the north and south markets was over 540 shi. The Bureau of Social Affairs continued to allocate Siamese rice as usual, but the stores were sluggish. White yuan and silver yuan fell back by 2-3,000 yuan. Japonica rice outside the market also fell by 4-5,000 yuan. The Xian rice supply remained small. Sentiment in the flour market was sluggish, with a slight softening. Wheat bran was scarce and still strong, rising another 5-600 to 1,000 yuan. The oil market also softened, with raw oil falling back by a small 2-3,000 yuan. Soybean oil continued to fall. Rapeseed oil and clear oil from factories had a constant supply source, and the situation was obviously weak. Soybean cake was extremely scarce, with very few transactions. The market trend was downwards. Due to the allocation of Northeastern soybeans by the China National Cereals, Oils and Foodstuffs Import and Export Corporation, soybeans became stagnant and fell back by 1-2,000 yuan. Black soybeans were flat and weak, similar to broad beans. Mung beans lacked vitality, and corn also declined by 1-2,000 yuan. However, sorghum was scarce and still stable. Sesame from Zhejiang was actively sought after, and the price rose by 3-4,000 yuan. Raw peanuts were strong, but secondary grades were reduced.

### Hua Nan Gang Collects Spot Goods, Yarn Market Reaches New High

Yesterday, the yarn market's upward trend continued. Due to rising prices in Guangdong, heavy-weight Double Horse spot goods reached a new high of 3.45 million yuan under the collection of Hua Nan Gang. Ordinary combed yarn also rose by 10,000 yuan. 16-count yarn was particularly popular, with spot goods extremely scarce, and prices exceeding 20-count yarn. 42-count double-strand thread was eagerly snapped up by cotton weaving and cloth factories, rising sharply by 400,000 yuan. Market sentiment was strong, and the trend remained upward.

A Cotton Textile Magnate Discusses Reasons for Yarn Price Increase

[Our Report] According to a leader in the cotton textile industry, the recent surge in cotton yarn prices can be attributed to the following reasons: (1) The aftermath of the issuance of new Customs Gold Unit banknotes has not subsided. (2) Yarn prices are rising in various regions, particularly in Hong Kong. According to a telegram from Hong Kong yesterday, the market price of 20-count special Double Horse yarn in that area has reached 5.6 million yuan. Although the cotton yarn originally shipped to Hong Kong from Japan is allocated at negotiated prices, Hong Kong has recently opened up exports of cotton textiles. Demand in Southeast Asia is strong, so cotton textile exports are booming, and cotton yarn in Hong Kong has become in short supply. Therefore, they are turning to Guangzhou and other places to collect, and cotton yarn prices in various parts of South China have generally risen again.

### Gray Fabric Soars, Printed Fabric Is Strong

The cloth market has become increasingly frenzied since the Shanghai Bureau of Social Affairs' Cotton Fabric Price Review Committee adjusted prices. Yesterday, gray fabric was in extremely tight supply, mainly due to the dyeing and weaving factories' extensive purchases. Printed fabrics were also in strong demand due to brisk actual sales in local shops. All parties are trying to replenish stock. Throughout the day, the price increases varied significantly. Furthermore, the major yarn mills have greatly reduced the amount of gray fabric they release. Today, Fangjian Company listed only two types of Grade 2 products, Yanghe and Longtou, at a price of 118,000 yuan, but this ultimately failed to meet everyone's expectations.

### Restrictions on the Southern Transportation of Yarn and Cloth, Executive Yuan Orders Temporary Suspension of Change

[Our Report] Regarding the controlled export of yarn and cloth to South China, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and other organizations, arguing that yarn and cloth have already resumed free trading, sent a letter to the Textile Control Committee requesting the cancellation of the Southern transportation restrictions. The Textile Control Committee reported the situation to the Executive Yuan for instructions. It is now learned that the Executive Yuan's instructions have arrived in Shanghai, ordering a temporary suspension of the change. Therefore, the association will continue to handle the Southern transportation of yarn and cloth this month as usual and will notify manufacturers to report their shipments after the routine meeting this Thursday.

### Serge Sales Are Booming in Beijing

American navy blue serge, priced at over 60,000 yuan per yard, has been selling very well recently. Merchants from Nanjing have been placing orders, and 7-800 yards have been transported through Jianhua Transport Company. It is said that the price of thin plain serge is too high, and general customers have switched to this material. Tailors in this street are aware of this, so they have also mutually distributed and purchased, resulting in a sudden surge in sales among industry peers. Other transactions have also been significantly boosted.

### Coal Market Uptrend Unabated

Bituminous Coal Reaches New Price

The supply of various grades of bituminous coal in the coal market is scarce, while demand is urgent. Sellers are raising prices sharply, and transaction prices are extremely chaotic. Although there are rumors in the market that the allocation of coal will be approved soon, the long-distance water cannot quench the immediate thirst, and the market situation is becoming increasingly tight. Although the price of white coal is slightly stable, the trend is also very firm. However, due to the impact of flat-priced briquettes, the market situation for firewood and charcoal is relatively stable.

### China Petroleum Corporation Orders Crude Oil from Britain

Due to the recent shortage of domestic petroleum raw materials, China Petroleum Corporation has ordered millions of barrels of crude oil from British Anglo-Iranian Oil Company at a price of only two U.S. dollars per barrel. The first batch of 5,937 tons is said to have been fully loaded and has set sail for Shanghai and is expected to arrive in Shanghai in mid-March. After receiving this batch of crude oil, the company will transport it all to the Taiwan refinery for refining, with most of it being made into gasoline, and the rest will be made into kerosene and diesel for sale in various regions.

### American Kerosene and Gasoline Will Soon Arrive in Large Quantities

This fuel is extracted from the American Consumer Cooperative Petroleum Well and refined at the Cooperative's oil field through the Cooperative's oil pipeline.

The delivery session fell from 880 yuan to 858 yuan. Although No. 224 absorbed, as the gold market reported lower prices, Nos. 199, 141, 179, 99, and 76 supplied again, suppressing the delivery of Yongsheng Yarn to 853 yuan.

### China Recovers Rare Ancient Books from Japan

[Gaiza-sha Tokyo Airmail] The Chinese delegation in Japan recently shipped back ten boxes of the first batch of rare books from the National Central Library of China via China Airlines, with another 107 boxes waiting to be transported.

During the War of Resistance, they were purchased by the National Central Library in Shanghai. Later, due to the increasingly dangerous war situation, they were moved to Hong Kong.

They were looted by the Japanese army and transported to Japan, stored in the Tokyo Ueno Imperial Library. After Japan's surrender, they were first discovered by Zhu Shiming, the Chinese representative in Japan. In April of last year, the Chinese delegation in Japan was formally established and was responsible for negotiating the recovery. The total number is 3,286 volumes in 34,970 books.

### Third Inter-Port Match in Hong Kong Ends in Another Defeat for the Shanghai Team Against the Hong Kong Armed Forces Team

Improper Formation Configuration Leads to Unexpected and Disastrous Defeat

[Hong Kong Air Mail] In the third match of the Shanghai Inter-Port Football Team, facing the Hong Kong Army, Navy, and Air Force Joint Team at Causeway Bay, the number of spectators was far less crowded than at the official Inter-Port matches because it was not a holiday. The match began at 4:00 p.m. Because team captain Li Yichen was injured and unable to play, Jia Youliang took over as acting captain. When choosing positions, the Armed Forces team chose to defend the side facing the mountain and sea, with the wind at their backs. Roberts Toff kicked off, and the 90-minute match began. The Armed Forces team's lineup was as predicted. Because the Shanghai team still used Xin Fuzhen as center back, the excellent center back general Song Lingsheng was switched to left midfield, and the right wing was temporarily assigned to the useless Carlo Liequ instead of Han Longhai. Thus, the lineup was as follows:

Armed Forces Team

Bao Weilu

Greenie Abraham

Anderson Queman Kanbu Road

Ford Shutge Gao Loto Stichland Hekie

Shanghai

Zhang Banglun

Manya Wu Qixiang

Han Longpi Xin Fuzhen Gao Baozheng

Li Shi Zhu Mengsheng Roberts Toff Carlo Liequ Jia Youliang

A Great Surprise This time, because Sha Quexun Jin Shun and Yan Shixin were with the army, the Shanghai team's strength was fundamentally discounted. In addition, Li Yichen's swollen foot prevented him from playing, naturally affecting the offensive power. If Han Longhai and Luo Shoufu were still used as supporting forwards yesterday, and Song Lingsheng was used as the center back, then the offensive and defensive powers might not have been as ineffective as yesterday. To lose to the Armed Forces team, it should be known that the current members of the Hong Kong Armed Forces team are seen by football fans as not yet reaching the strength of a single team like Sing Tao or South China. Yesterday, the Shanghai team could not win, no wonder everyone said after the game that it was too unexpected.

Li Shi Scores First Yesterday's shooting process was that after the Shanghai team was repeatedly attacked, they suddenly launched a counterattack eight minutes into the game. Song Lingsheng got the ball and wanted to shoot, but he kicked off course, and the ball rolled diagonally to the left, where Li Yao cut in. Roberts Toff also rushed in, just covering between Abraham and Bao Weilu, leaving a gap for Li Yao to recognize and shoot in.

A Scoreless Tie After the restart, the Armed Forces team launched another major counterattack. Twelve minutes into the game, Stichland made a diagonal shot near the goal, and the ball went over people's heads and into the right side of the Shanghai goal. This ball was impossible for Zhang Banglun to resist, and the first half ended in a 1-1 tie.

Another Goal Lost In the second half, both sides had attacks and defenses, and the Armed Forces team did not dominate as much as in the first half. But eight minutes into the game, Hekie suddenly found an opportunity to dribble the ball into the center and straight in. Xin Fuzhen could not catch up, and watched him approach the goal and shoot into the net. The Armed Forces team took the lead 2-1.

Penalty Kick At that time, both sides only had hard-hitting performances, with no beautiful techniques to be seen. Until eight minutes before the end of the game, Xin Fuzhen was flagged by the linesman for a foul in the penalty area, resulting in a penalty kick. The Armed Forces team's left back Greenie stepped forward to take the kick, and it was a bullseye. The Shanghai team lost 1-3 at the end of the game.

Three Corner Kicks What was most noteworthy yesterday was the very few corner kicks. It was calculated that neither side had kicked a corner kick in the first half. In the second half, the Armed Forces team had one corner kick first, and the Shanghai team had two. There were only three corner kicks in the whole game, which shows that neither side's goal was ever very tense.

### Last Night's Basketball League: Hwa Lien Beats All Blacks by a Landslide

[Report from this newspaper] There were originally three games in the second Basketball League last night. In the second game, the Group A Indian team forfeited to Hwa Yang, so only two games remained. In the first act, the women's group, Qiang Hua easily defeated the Li team. In the final act, Hwa Lien beat All Blacks by a landslide. The battle situation is as follows:

Qiang Hua Easily Defeats Li Team In the opening women's group match, Qiang Hua met the Li team. Gu Liqing of the Li team scored first with a free throw, but it was only a fleeting moment. Cao Manli, Cao Manti, and Huang Jun of Qiang Hua formed a three-legged power, and the score rose sharply. Qiang Hua took the lead 10-1 in the first quarter and 14-1 in the first half. After changing sides, the Cao family team became even more rampant. Chen Wenyan of the Li team only scored one point with a free throw, and the third quarter was 32-2. In the final quarter, Chen Wenyan of the Li team made one shot and one free throw to pull back three points. In the end, Qiang Hua won a landslide victory over the Li team with a score of 58-5.

Hwa Lien's Fierce Offense Hwa Lien and All Blacks took the stage for the final battle. Only five All Blacks players arrived before the game, losing momentum first. After the whistle sounded, Bao Songgang scored first with a free throw. Zhang Shaoqiang of the All Blacks scored three points with consecutive throws and free throws. Hwa Lien made a move with all of its team, and intensified its offensive. Chen Xuechong made two free throws, and Lao Bao scored again. Li Zude of All Blacks returned a goal, and Hwa Lien took the lead 10-4. Zhang Liangxiong of Hwa Lien threw again, Xu Jusheng of All Blacks skillfully scored a hollow basket, Hwa Lien called a timeout, took off his velvet coat, and showed a strong determination to win, and the pressure became tighter. Although Ah Zhang of the All Blacks sprinted several times, he was helpless to support the team alone. In the first half, Hwa Lien led 25-14.

All Blacks Was at a Loss After changing sides and exchanging blows, Lu Dazhen of All Blacks rushed to join the battle, replacing Li Zude. However, All Blacks knew they were no match and played somewhat playfully, losing more and more goals. Ah Di of Hwa Lien also came on stage, and Chen Xuechong temporarily retired. Ren Xiangcheng scored twice, and Ah Di added to the glory. At 41-14, All Blacks was at a loss. Zhang Shaoqing came up with an idea and attacked from the flanks, scoring two goals in a row. Chen Xuechong returned to the field again, replacing the lax Lao Bao, and his prestige reached its peak. Li Zhen smoked outside the field, and Kong Guangyi watched the game with a smile, and the victory was certain. In the last four minutes, Hwa Lien scored 60-30, doubling All Blacks' score. In the end, the result was 64-39.

### Football Friendly Match: Railway vs. Hequn

After being removed from the Lian Ze for dereliction of duty, Hequn practiced diligently, intending to show off in the Mayor's Cup, so today's friendly match is no less than a touchstone for the team.

Returning from Qingdao to Jinan, the reporter took the Qing-Ji direct express train that was newly added starting from the 6th of this month. This express train runs once a day in each direction. At 7:25 a.m. on the 9th, before the train departed, I circled the car and discovered that this express car was remodeled and upgraded. The former third class was upgraded to second class, and the second class was upgraded to first class. The car was upgraded, but the passengers were downgraded. However, in terms of other facilities and hospitality on the car, it is better than the Jinling and Qiantang on both lines.

Because the reporter's stay in Qingdao was too short, I missed the opportunity to visit the Sifang Machine Factory, the second largest machine factory in the country attached to the railway bureau. The only way to make up for it was to ask Zhou Wenqin, director of the General Affairs Office of the Railway Bureau, to introduce Pan Shining, director of the Machinery Department of the bureau, who was on the same train, to explain the general situation of the factory to the reporter after the train departed.

Sifang Machine Factory Makes Its Own Locomotives

According to Director Pan, among the machine factories in the country that can manufacture their own locomotives (i.e., train heads), in addition to the Panyang Locomotive Manufacturing Plant, there is also the Sifang Machine Factory. The factory has a total of 950 machines and 1,800 technical workers, of which 1,300 are originally present and 500 are returning from the rear. During the Japanese management period, manufacturing was once stopped and only repairs were done. After I took over in November of the year before last, because the three repair factories in Puzhen, Jinan, and Tianjin were more than capable of handling the repair work of the Jinpu Railway, and the Sifang Machine Factory originally had manufacturing capabilities, coupled with the fact that the enemy had many steel products left over when they handed it over, I decided to widely collect materials and engage in creation. To date, two locomotives have been manufactured, and the third is scheduled to be completed this month. If we look at the situation of the Panyang Locomotive Manufacturing Plant, which was taken over by the Resources Committee and only manufactures locomotives and does not repair them, only one locomotive has been completed in the past year, then the work efficiency of the Sifang Machine Factory is much higher. Director Pan also said: At the beginning of the takeover, many Japanese technical personnel were employed, but now they have all been replaced by Chinese, which shows that without foreigners, Chinese people can also independently undertake the manufacturing tasks of heavy industry.

This Year's Planned Output Estimate

The factory plans to manufacture nine locomotives, 24 passenger cars, and 240 freight cars this year, which will require approximately 38 billion yuan. According to the factory's existing equipment, if materials and technical personnel are replenished, it can manufacture five locomotives per month for the locomotives alone, or 60 per year. If we calculate based on the current 1,500 locomotives on the national railway, it can replenish one-twenty-fifth of them each year. In recent years, the military cars used on the Jiaoji Jinpu Railway have mostly been repaired by the Western Factory. The fishplates, spikes, etc. used for repairing roads are also produced by Sifang.

Departing Early, Arriving on the Same Day

Director Pan had just finished introducing the Sifang Machine Factory when someone on the train asked why the departure time from Jinan Station was specifically advanced by one hour and twenty-five minutes compared to Qingdao, departing at 6:00 a.m., causing some passengers to miss the train due to the curfew. Director Zhou replied on this point: This is entirely to take into account the safety of passengers, because the Communist army is more active and destroys more roads in the area near Qingdao from Chengyang to Gaomi. Therefore, when setting the time for the express train west from Qingdao, it had to be after dawn at 7:25 a.m. Similarly, in order to pass Chengyang before dark when departing from Jinan, the departure time from Jinan had to be advanced to 6:00 a.m. before dawn. Because the Communist army currently does not dare to openly destroy roads in broad daylight, and mostly does it at night. In order to facilitate passengers, in addition to changing the ability to purchase tickets and reserve seats one day in advance, the railway bureau can only make the passengers in Jinan get up early and work harder! Director Zhou also said: The distance between Qing and Ji is 392 kilometers. Ordinary express trains take two days and about 17 hours (stopping at night). Now, the express train only takes 13 hours and can arrive on the same day, which is naturally much more progressive.

Steel Rails Destroyed, Rushed to Repair That Night

The train arrived at Jiaoxian at 9:29 a.m. and Gaomi at 10:20 a.m., arriving on time as scheduled. However, when the train reached Caijiazhuang, a small station two stations west of Gaomi, which was originally not scheduled to stop, it suddenly stopped and stopped for a particularly long time. At first, I didn't understand, but then I saw some passengers had gotten off the train, so I followed them. At this station, which was so badly damaged that it was impossible to find a complete house, the stationmaster was telling the reason for the train's stop. It turned out that between Talbao, Zhangling, and Taibaozhuang in front of them, more than a thousand Communist troops had blown up five sections of the common rail and a total of 49 rails after 11:00 p.m. last night. In addition, a ten-meter steel bridge was also blown up. By the time the road protection army and police heard the explosion and rushed to encircle and suppress them, the Communist troops had fled to Shuangyangdian south of the railway! The railway bureau sent an engineering train to rush to repair the damaged steel rails that night and completed the work. Now, because the steel bridge has not yet been completed, we have to wait a little longer.

Communist Army Dreams of Overturning the Express Train

The stationmaster also said: The Communist army's original intention was to overturn this special express train, but his attempt was obviously a failure!

The bridge was not completed until 11:20 a.m., and the Communist army made us stay on the train for 32 minutes longer. When the train passed through the damaged area, I also saw many of the blown-up steel rails and steel bridges, broken and discarded by the roadside. Some of the destroyed telegraph pole porcelain bottles still occasionally emitted scattered flashes under the sunlight.

Railway Bureau's Difficulties, Expenses Exceed Income

At 2:10 p.m., the train passed Weixian. According to statistics, fewer incidents occur west of here, and everyone's mood was not as tense as in the morning. During this period, the person in charge of the railway bureau also told me: The current actual difficulties of the railway bureau are (1) Expenses exceed income: If the Jiaoji Line is to be fully restored to its pre-war state, it will still require at least 25 billion. Where will this money come from? Even in terms of the current income and expenditure situation, it is necessary to overdraw about 3 billion each month. (2) Material difficulties: Whether it is sleepers, steel rails, locomotives, or even telecommunications equipment, nothing is lacking. It is useless to talk about having no money, and even if you have money, it is not easy to buy. There are currently 350 passenger cars and more than 2,000 freight cars on this road, which are barely available for use at present, but if the Jinpu Road is repaired, it will become a big problem.

Extreme Lack of Railway Talent

(3) Lack of talent: Most of the railway's needs are for specialized technical talent. Those trained during the enemy and puppet era only know one thing. Especially, there is a shortage of middle and lower-level cadres. Jiao Tong University's graduates are also inadequate. It is hoped that various universities can set up more railway management departments or railway management specialized courses. (4) The fundamental and biggest difficulty is the endless destruction of roads by the Communist army. "Destruction is easy, construction is difficult." It is hoped that the Communist army will show some conscience and everyone will focus on the national economy and people's livelihood. Repairing damaged roads is actually more difficult than building new roads.

Smooth Transportation in All Directions, Humorous Couplet

The train finally arrived safely at Jinan Station at 8:40 p.m. When the reporter stepped out of the station, I saw that the pine and cypress archway built by the railway bureau to celebrate the New Year had not yet been dismantled. Some of the first-time passengers from Qingdao were reciting this humorous couplet on the archway:

Air transport and land travel, smooth transportation in all directions;

Spring returns with good scenery, all things are rejuvenated.

### New Trends in Industry and Commerce: Various Countries Promote Daily Necessities

— Special Correspondent Wang Yizhi, Radio Dispatch from Leiden, 26th

The latest economic policy of Russia is to promote the production of Consumers' Goods for daily use. Daily use consumer goods refer to clothing, food, utensils, and other necessities for the people. It is estimated that the Russian industrial manufacturing capacity in 1947-20 can produce 500,000 beds, 4,000 tons (i.e., 4 million kilograms) of kitchen utensils, woodenware valued at 250 trillion chablis, 5 million pairs of ski shoes, 23 million pairs of socks for men and women, and 13.5 million pairs of leather shoes. Based on a total Russian population of 150 trillion, on average, only one out of every ten people can get new leather shoes, and only 13 million knitted wool and cotton shirts, which seems that only one garment can be distributed for every ten people. It is said that Russia will not be able to complete large-scale state-owned footwear and socks industries until 1950. At that time, it is expected that 240 trillion pairs of shoes and 580 trillion pairs of socks for men and women can be created for distribution across the country, which will finally be sufficient. The current fourth "Five-Year Plan," starting in 1946 and continuing to 1950, is particularly focused on expanding the food and daily necessities industries. However, their development cannot proceed as rapidly as the steel and chemical industries. It is feared that even by 1950, the pre-war state will not be restored, as the Russian territory is now much larger than it was in 1940, and the population has also increased dramatically. According to the planned pace of the fourth Five-Year Plan, the breeding of livestock, and the harvests of wheat, cotton, flax, and other agricultural products must achieve numbers in 1950 that exceed the original production volume of 1940 by a certain percentage. Without raw materials, more production will be difficult. This depends half on human effort and half on nature. Whether it will be fulfilled as desired by then is something that cannot be predicted today.

Reviving Industry, Eliminating Panic

The manufactured goods independently produced by industrial nations are indeed inexpensive. However, if we observe this from another perspective, we see that when people are busy with industry, they often fail to give equal attention to agriculture. In countries where industrial products are cheap, the prices of agricultural products become more expensive. Or, if their domestic agricultural production is insufficient and they have to rely on imports from overseas, then, in this Pacific era, a populous nation like China, even if labor costs are lower than in other countries, may still need to purchase grains, which are fundamental to the people's diet, from other countries. If other countries discover this weakness, and the source is cut off, the country will suffer famine. In wartime, overseas transportation can be suddenly interrupted. People can still survive without essential industrial products, but agricultural products are indispensable. No matter how desolate or chaotic the world may be, rural households can easily be self-sufficient. In China, rice and cloth already represent a fulfillment of both hunger and warmth. However, laborers in large cities struggle to survive, suffering the pain of hunger and starvation. Prioritizing agriculture is the first task of all, and sufficient food is the key to stabilizing the people. China is as vast and populous as Russia. If the people speak of industry, promoting the manufacture of "daily consumer goods" is most beneficial. These goods are the foundation of the country, always needing replenishment, and having a daily market, making it least likely to cause unemployment panic. Other things, such as indispensable luxury goods for beauty, sports equipment that makes people feel younger, and ingeniously designed and novel inventions, can all cater to the demands of human nature and be exchanged with friendly nations for our indispensable commercial rights. If these things are entirely made by foreigners, for example, a radio receiver that is essential in modern families, or a vacuum cleaner that can both sweep and dust, once purchased, there is no need to replace it for five or ten years or more. If these items were all made domestically, then, as mentioned above, new inventions, luxury goods, or sports equipment, which do not need to be replenished frequently and do not have a daily market, are most likely to cause public panic due to overproduction.

Fine Craftsmanship and Arts: Catching Up Quickly

Our country's industrial knowledge is still nascent, so why take such a great risk? I believe that the Chinese people value loyalty, bravery, and peace. Among the European countries, we are somewhat similar to Switzerland, which is free from worldly strife. The Chinese are skilled in fine craftsmanship and arts, such as carving, embroidery, porcelain, lacquerware, and trinkets, which is very similar to the Swiss who love to make watches and wood carvings during their agricultural leisure time. In the past, unscrupulous Japanese merchants, recognizing the psychology of European and American countries welcoming Chinese goods, used counterfeits to deceive and profit, which is hateful and regrettable. Now, inferior goods bearing the name "Made in China" are fortunately disappearing in European and American cities. Our country can always maintain its undefeated position in fine craftsmanship and arts. Since fine craftsmanship and arts do not conflict with the new inventions and innovations of machine manufacturing in friendly European and American nations, we should seize this moment and move forward, while making overseas merchants related to this fine craftsmanship and arts the bridge to expand the sales of domestic goods. This is a small hope for our Chinese team to negotiate commercial treaties and exchange equal rights with small countries, simple and easy to implement.

Stabilizing the People: Emphasizing Agriculture and Ensuring Food Sufficiency

Those with particularly large investments in Westernization, such as coffee in Brazil, sugar in Cuba, and rubber in Singapore, are not without great benefits that are pleasing for a time, but they are all mono-agriculture. When faced with sudden competition from other countries' agricultural products, it is very easy to lead to tragedies such as unemployment and famine. Our country is vast and rich in resources, superior to Russia, and very similar to France in Europe and the United States in America, with broad paths for survival, so we should not be misled by greed. Gu Tinglin said, "When the world is in chaos, the people gather in cities; when the world is at peace, the people disperse in the fields. Sufficient food is the key to stabilizing the people, and prioritizing agriculture is the first task of all." If the people have available funds and plan to seek machinery from overseas, they should first acquire those sufficient to expand agriculture and water conservancy for beneficial use. Then, they should acquire and use those that can increase agricultural production and promote the daily consumer goods industry. Proceeding in this way will both strengthen the country and benefit the people's livelihood. For those who extravagantly advocate establishing new industries without selection or planning, straying from the path, blindly following trends without considering their capabilities, there should be at least ten times more certainty to guarantee success.

### Key US Government Officials Resigning, Creating Serious Problems

— Translated by Xi from the American magazine "Newsweek"

Recently, quite a few key US government officials have requested resignations one after another: Baruch and his capable colleagues have resigned as Chairman and members of the United Nations Atomic Energy Commission; Mayhew and Smith have resigned as President and Vice President of the International Bank; Vinant has resigned as the US representative to the United Nations Economic and Social Council; Bernays has resigned from his position as Secretary of State, and Acheson is about to resign as Undersecretary of State; Admiral Leahy is about to resign as Chief of Staff to the US President.

In the past few weeks, the US government has lost several exceptionally talented individuals such as Wyeth and Puder, and even more experienced young people were lost throughout the past year.

The departure of this large group of individuals has greatly weakened the efficiency of public service. Narrow-minded Republicans not only do not feel worried about this but instead believe: (1) that some people are resigning because they distrust Truman's prospects; (2) that the degradation of the government's administrative departments will make the prospects of the Republican Party in 1948 even more optimistic.

Acheson

However, when a first-rate person steps down, especially when a replacement with comparable ability cannot be found, it is ultimately a loss for the entire country. If a large number of first-rate people resign their positions at the same time, the loss is even greater. The consequences are low national administrative efficiency, and the entire government or certain departments may disintegrate as a result. The country is in danger of regressing.

The large number of government officials resigning from international public service indeed creates a very serious problem. Among them are also several older statesmen, whose appointments to key positions were originally temporary; Baruch, Mayhew, and Leahy all belong to this category of people. After their departure, it is not easy to find suitable successors. President Truman has not yet invited responsible individuals to serve as President of the International Bank.

Baruch

The imminent resignation of Acting Secretary of State Acheson will be another major loss for the US government. He has consistently acted as Secretary of State during Secretary of State Bernays' attendance at international conferences. Although his power was limited and his staff was insufficient, Acheson made every effort to keep the Secretary of State unified and maintain America's consistent policies.

President Truman often laments that he cannot recruit first-rate people, and at the same time, he does not seem to be able to make every effort to retain the excellent people he has already obtained. Wyeth is an example. He is an individual with great intelligence and energy, and his resignation is indeed a great loss to the public.

Among the many reasons for resignation, there is at least one factor that the US Congress can and should correct: the meager salaries. Although US government salaries were raised last year, they are still very low compared to the salaries of leaders in the business world. Most first-rate government officials, unless they possess private property, generally find it difficult to sustain themselves in public service.

### Sweden Today: Wavering Between the US and the Soviet Union

— (Translated by Xishui from the American magazine "Life")

Sweden can be considered one of the most Americanized countries in the world. Although this is not a new development, the tendency of Sweden to become Americanized is increasing, especially after the end of the war, when Sweden must rely heavily on imports of American goods. Thirty percent of Sweden's total imports come from the United States. American cars can be seen everywhere in Sweden, mostly 1946 models, and some 1947 models.

From Gothenburg to small towns and villages, every main street in Switzerland can be called an American street. The stores in the capital, Stockholm, are filled with American goods, some of which are not easy to buy in the United States. There you can find American soap, safety razors and blades, canned food, groceries, gummy candies, radios, light bulbs, and daily necessities such as lighters, sunglasses, and fountain pens. Some of these goods must be purchased with ration coupons, such as a bar of soap. Moreover, prices are often so high that people dare not ask. A pack of ordinary American cigarettes costs two kronor, about 70 cents in US dollars. An American radio costs twice the market price in the United States, and an American fountain pen costs more than twice as much.

On the surface, Sweden seems Americanized, and public opinion is extremely pro-American, but the Swedish government is leading the country to follow the political line of the Soviet Union. The Swedish government recently concluded a trade and credit agreement with the Soviet Union, with Sweden granting the Soviet Union a 1 billion kronor credit loan specifically for the purchase of Swedish goods. The Swedish public generally believes that this is a serious turning point in Swedish foreign policy. Government spokesmen have repeatedly said: Why shouldn't Sweden, which has now lost the German market, trade with the Soviet Union as it does with Western democracies? However, the Swedish people eagerly want to know: Why should Sweden, as a small country, lend the Soviet Union a huge loan of 1 billion kronor? Compared with the national wealth, this is an unbearable figure. The United States has already lent its wartime ally, Britain, about 4 billion. But the Swedes say: The Soviet Union is not Sweden's ally. In Stockholm's park, opposite the Royal Palace, stands the statue of King Charles XII, Sweden's Napoleon, who fought against the Russians in the early eighteenth century. One hand rests on his sword hilt, the other is raised high. The Swedes will tell you that his hand is pointing towards Moscow.

The consequences of the Swedish-Soviet trade agreement are not difficult to predict. Soviet merchants or government representatives will come into contact with Swedish industrialists. Swedish industry must be expanded in order to fully fulfill the terms of the agreement. Soviet representatives are already preparing to move into Stockholm; the Soviet ambassador has already occupied the magnificent former Japanese embassy. The current Prime Minister Erlander was originally the Minister of Education and did not aspire to his current position, but now that he has assumed this position, he is determined to take his responsibility seriously with the attitude of a university professor. Of course, he cannot overturn the policies he has inherited, but I believe he will do his best to restore Sweden to the "middle way."

Current Affairs Commentary

### The Torment of British Diplomacy

— Chu Yukun

Since the beginning of this year, British diplomacy has shown an active posture. On the one hand, the Anglo-French alliance, after the visit of former French Prime Minister Blum to Britain, has been materialized, and the alliance treaty will soon be signed and established. On the other hand, Anglo-Soviet relations have shown great improvement after the visit of British Chief of Staff Montgomery to Moscow. Swiss newspapers have even widely reported that Britain and the Soviet Union have established a secret agreement to divide their spheres of influence in Europe and the Near East. On the surface, British diplomacy seems very smooth and has achieved considerable success. However, in reality, the torment of British diplomats is deepening day by day.

Regarding the Anglo-French alliance, there is no problem in Britain and France, but what is the attitude of the Soviet Union? This is of great importance. From the perspective of Britain and France, the Anglo-French alliance can supplement the deficiencies of the Anglo-Soviet treaty and the Franco-Soviet treaty and promote the Anglo-French-Soviet triangular relationship, similar to the Anglo-French Entente before World War I. The Soviet Union should not express any objections. However, according to recent statements by the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union has not been able to completely eliminate its suspicion of the Anglo-French alliance intention. How will Britain obtain the Soviet Union's understanding? This still requires continued efforts from the British diplomatic authorities.

Secondly, regarding Anglo-Soviet relations, although Britain has the sincerity to gain the Soviet Union's goodwill, is the Soviet Union truly willing to maintain a close relationship with Britain? At least for now, this is still a serious question. For example, the Soviet radio station broadcast a TASS news report on the 28th of last month, openly accusing the British policy towards the Soviet Union of running counter to the spirit of the Anglo-Soviet alliance treaty. At the same time, Soviet newspapers launched a large-scale attack on the British military presence in Abyssinia, and a concrete relationship still cannot be established. Moreover, we also feel that although British diplomacy is experienced and shrewd, it is ultimately inferior to the sophisticated maneuvering of Soviet diplomats.

In the past month, we have seen very clearly that the Soviet Union's attitude towards Britain has indeed changed. It is not like in the past, where it made things difficult for Britain everywhere, specifically seizing on the Greek issue, the Iranian issue, and the Spanish issue to attack British foreign policy as endangering world peace. However, it is questionable whether the change in the Soviet Union's attitude towards Britain has other purposes. In the past month, the Soviet Union's attitude towards the United States has remained the same. Moreover, the Soviet propaganda offensive has targeted the United States everywhere, either attacking the United States for adopting atomic diplomacy or scolding the United States for attempting to monopolize atomic energy. Here, we can see a subtle effect. The Soviet Union has clearly adopted a divisive policy towards Britain and the United States. In weighing the balance, the Soviet Union's treatment of the United States and Britain already has a tendency to differentiate between intimacy and distance. Recalling before the outbreak of World War II, wasn't Nazi Germany's foreign policy pro-British and anti-French? Wasn't Japan's policy towards Britain and the United States pro-American and anti-British? Therefore, what is the Soviet Union's true intention? Britain still cannot grasp it!

In addition, the most troublesome issue for Britain after the war, the Palestinian problem, after two years of turmoil, bloodshed, and terror, the Holy Land has now become a dark hell. The seriousness of the situation is increasing, forcing the British government to order British women and children to evacuate back home. At the same time, the round table conference on the Palestinian issue held in London not only has no hope of solving the Palestinian problem, but the leaders of the Zionist movement have consistently refused to participate in the meeting. It is expected that the future result will be that the London round table conference will repeat the failure of last September and will again end in failure, forcing Britain to refer this issue to the United Nations General Assembly.

In short, it is the torment of the British diplomatic authorities, and it is also the troubles of the post-war world.

### Soviet Censorship: Always Present in History, More Intense Today

— Translated by Zuo from American Newsweek

As early as 1885, an American writer named George Kennan, after traveling from Siberia, wrote a monumental book entitled "Siberia and the Exile System." In the book, he did not mention the names of many people who provided him with information, specifically stating his difficulties in the preface: "I dare not even mention the names of these many people. Although their character and contributions are worthy of remembrance and respect, they unfortunately grew up in Russia, where the government regards frank opinions as unreliable things and regards innovative efforts as a crime."

Anyone who has traveled to the Soviet Union knows that the basic characteristics described in these kinds of ancient books have not changed to this day. The Soviet Union's strict attitude towards censorship has never changed. They closely monitor foreign journalists and cut off sources of information, making it extremely difficult to gather news. The official's rude attitude towards foreign journalists has caused the United States to have an unpleasant impression of the Soviet Union.

Why do these situations exist in the Soviet Union? My explanation is as follows: First, the Soviet Union's attitude towards censorship is merely an extreme manifestation of the general attitude held by European countries. Outside of Britain and the United States, the idea that the government has the right and responsibility to control the thoughts of the people is almost a universal tradition. In this regard, the Soviet Communist revolution does not count as a revolution. The predecessors who nurtured the spirit of the Soviet revolution, such as Feuerbach, Herzen, Bakunin, Belinsky, and even Lenin and Stalin, led nothing more than revolutions of the intellectual class. In their conception, the so-called "people" are nothing more than a mob being dominated and led. Even if we include Marx and Engels among the revolutionary martyrs, it cannot change this basic typical Soviet thought in the slightest.

The Soviet Union's suspicion of foreigners is nothing more than a tendency to keep secrets. After reading history and travelogues, one cannot conclude whether this suspicion is stronger under the Soviet government than in the Tsarist era. The George Kennan mentioned above, if he had not given a speech in the American Geographical Society in New York beforehand, supporting Russia's treatment of political prisoners, the Russian authorities would never have allowed him to travel freely in the Siberian exile lands.

If you think that this suspicion is limited to Moscow, you are mistaken. Originally, this is a universal phenomenon. Travelers, even if they carry Moscow passports, will still be suspected by local officials everywhere.

This attitude was by no means created by Stalin; it was already nurtured in the character of the Russian people in past generations. Therefore, although we advise the Soviet authorities to change this attitude, the result only increases their suspicion of us.

### Dardanelles

— Qi

After World War II, Turkey's million-strong defense forces have not yet been demobilized and have even intensified their alert at various strategic locations. The reasons for this include the internal instability and frequent armed conflicts in neighboring countries (such as Greece and Iran), which Turkey fears will be affected, as well as the strong neighbor's coveting of the Dardanelles, which Turkey considers its lifeline, as the biggest factor.

The Dardanelles Strait, belonging to Turkey, is the only passage for countries on the Black Sea to reach the Mediterranean Sea, and has always been valued internationally. During World War I, Turkey joined the Central Powers and failed. The Allied Powers then signed the Treaty of Lausanne with Turkey, stipulating that no fortresses or troops could be stationed on both sides of the strait. Later, Turkey requested the abolition of this unequal treaty. In 1936, it signed a convention in Montreux, Switzerland, with Britain, France, the Soviet Union, Japan, Greece, South, Romania, Bulgaria, and other countries, abolishing some restrictions, but stipulating that Turkey must not block the Dardanelles. Turkey has adhered to this agreement to this day. Since last year, the Soviet Union has repeatedly presented notes to Turkey, demanding that the Soviet Union and Turkey jointly manage the strait. This move by the Soviet Union seems to want to abandon the Montreux Convention, which the countries concerned should oppose, because the Soviet Union overemphasizes its own security and sovereignty and infringes on the security and sovereignty of other countries.

After World War II, the relationship between the three major powers, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, has never been fully coordinated. The new status of the Dardanelles is unpredictable. Britain has proposed convening a meeting of the countries that signed the Montreux Convention, replacing Japan with the United States, to discuss the future of the strait. The Soviet Union's policy has recently been changing, becoming slightly more moderate than before, but it is difficult to say whether it is willing to compromise on the issue of the strait.

### Tolstoy's Later Years

— Ke Tong

It is well known that the Russian literary giant Tolstoy has achieved brilliant accomplishments and immortal value in the world literary scene. In his later years, his thinking underwent a great transformation. This transformation had already shown signs before "Anna Karenina" was finished. By 1877, when the book was published, or at the turn of the 1870s and 1880s, he began to feel an internal change, pursuing a life that was more sincere and had more spiritual value than reality. He persisted in this intention until his death. As a result, the many years of happy love and affection between him and his wife came to an end.

In the early stage of Tolstoy's ideological transformation, he vehemently explored the doctrines of Orthodox Christianity, hoping to find a way out of his thoughts within the church. He believed that religion was what the general public believed in. He might be able to better understand the people from this. However, his exploration ended in disappointment, and he gradually abandoned Orthodox Christianity. During this period, he became increasingly estranged from his family, and it could be said that he rarely cared about his children. Occasional impulses would make him disgusted with his wife. In addition, he suffered five bereavements within four years. His dissatisfaction with life and his pursuit of truth became increasingly intense. Reading his "Confessions" or other works, we know that his pursuit did not yield satisfactory results, and he sometimes had thoughts of leaving home and committing suicide. He pursued faith in God, so he sometimes went to talk with Count Bobrinsky about the teachings of the British missionary Radstock, sometimes visited his close friend S.S. Urusov to discuss the beliefs of the Orthodox Church, sometimes questioned itinerant believers, and sometimes sought advice from priests and clergymen. However, no person and no principle could satisfy his wishes and restore him to tranquility! As his own spirit declined and withered, an extreme resistance arose against the existing religion, the progress of civilization, science, the family, and the accumulation of hundreds of years of human evolution. What he saw in his heart seemed to belong to the evil and hardship, and all the joyful and lovely things disappeared without a trace.

Although Tolstoy stood in opposition to Orthodox Christianity and the church, he acknowledged that Jesus' teachings were valuable sacred words. He believed that the former contradicted the latter. Tolstoy most opposed the pointless rituals of religion. He strived to apply the Gospel to practical life. In Chapter 4 of "My Religion," "Misunderstanding of Christ's Teachings," he said: "Generally speaking, people have various different interpretations of Christ's teachings, but the direct and simple meaning naturally revealed in the words is ignored. He followed Christ's teachings and applied them to practical life. Tolstoy's teachings paid most attention to individual liberation, hoping to dismantle the entire evil society through individual repentance. In Chapter 3 of "My Religion," "God's Laws and Human Laws," he said: "Christ's laws always move and please me. However, in every aspect, historical traditions and my current environment, my own life, another kind of law governs us. Although this cannot be reconciled with my conscience and intellect, it is compatible with my bestiality. I feel that if I accept Christ's laws, I will be different from the general public, and I will be harmed and criticized as Christ predicted. But if I accept human laws, I can be approved by everyone and get a peaceful and stable life. Various theological subtleties can be cited by me to earn the comfort of my conscience, and as Christ said, I can laugh and be happy. I recognize this situation, so I dare not pursue what God's laws are. I only distort them and continue my bestial life."

In 1884, Tolstoy once wanted to elope with a field worker, a peasant woman, and go to open up a new life with the farmers, but in the end it did not happen. Another time, Tolstoy had a disagreement with his wife over horses. He checked some personal belongings, wrapped them in a package, and left home, claiming that he was going to America and would never come back. At four o'clock the next morning, he finally couldn't bear it and went home. In 1897, Tolstoy again decided to leave. No one knew his secret, and he wrote a letter to his wife, but in the end that plan was not realized either. From this, it can be seen that the change in his thinking in his later years had drawn an irreparable chasm between him and his family, until his death. A great soul goes to pursue the truth, and his heart is more eager than love.

In 1891 and the following two years, Tolstoy participated in the work of helping disaster victims. At first he was satisfied, but later he still thought it was not enough, and he wanted to move towards a more self-sacrificing behavior. In 1895, his youngest son, Vanechka, passed away. This was a great blow to Tolstoy. After that, the last link between him and his family broke, sowing the distant cause of his departure in 1897 (this time, as mentioned above, he did not really leave). After Vanechka's death, the children who had slowly grown up got married one by one and left. The family seemed extraordinarily quiet and indifferent, and Tolstoy's health also deteriorated. In September 1901, he moved to Crimea in the south on doctor's orders, where he lived for ten months. His health did not improve at all, but worsened. After that, he left the world, probably to find the truth in another world.

### Clouds

— Zheng Zhao

Clouds, the heaven where poets exile their emotions, farmers see as a joyful sign of spring budding; an old helmsman at sea, occasionally seeing a cloud coming from the ocean, will think that there should be a wind, an east wind, a south wind, or a northwest wind.

I love clouds, I love them like surging waves, coming with the force of a thousand pounds toppling mountains and overturning seas, how majestic this spirit is. I love clouds, I love their beautiful and ingenious shapes, evoking my reverie. I love clouds, whether it is a clear blue sky dotted with white clouds, or a colorful and bright cloud at sunset.

The symbol of clouds is refreshing, illusory, and also liberating. Look carefully, think carefully, it can represent life, life is like a cloud.

The personality of clouds is innocent, pure, without hypocrisy and pretension. When it is angry, it pulls down its gloomy and stereotyped face; when it is happy, it will stretch its legs, swing its waist, head resting on Nanshan Mountain, and feet resting on Beigu Valley. It will also dance lion dances, play dragon lanterns, and when it is happy, it will do a conga dance.

The sky is the home of clouds, and clouds are the master of the sky. Without clouds, the sky would have no changes, no wind, rain, lightning, only a supreme and dictatorial sun. However, all things will wither because of it, and there will be no philosophers, poets, immortal epics, or tragic and tearful legends in the world. Although the universe will not lose its color, it has lost its soul. Clouds are great, clouds are gods who bestow enjoyment on mankind.

The frustrated can get comfort; the optimistic can express their aspirations; the elderly can enjoy themselves when they look at the clouds, and the middle-aged can have a detached view of life when they look at the clouds. Children look at the clouds, clap their little hands, stomp their feet, and shout and sing, "Uncle Cloud, where is your Lightning Goddess?"

Clouds sometimes show their amorous feelings, sometimes appreciate their own beauty, sometimes weep in the deep night, and sometimes climb high and whistle. Like young girls, lonely widows, hermits, and giant beasts, all are shaped in the changes of the wind and clouds.

And I love clouds because clouds are like my mother. As if giving warmth.

### Talking About Poetry

— Hu Ne

Poetry is not made up of beautiful words and phrases, and the quality of a poem cannot be determined by its external beauty; a good poem is not about the beauty of words, but about the richness and fulfillment of its content, and most importantly, poetry cannot be separated from reality.

Therefore, poetry is not the cry of a poet's heart, but the resonance of the lives of the masses!

Poets are the prophets of the masses, the bright lamps of glory, able to awaken the sleeping world and illuminate the opaque reality.

Poetry is not a pastime for refined people, poetry is a mirror of reality.

Poetry is the source of life, poetry can bring courage to people.

### Cold Scholar——Continuation of the Yangzhou Dream, Part Eight!

— Hong Weifa

In Yangzhou, when residents have weddings, funerals, or celebrations, many beggars come to ask for alms, which is the same as in other places. Among these beggars, the cold scholar occupies a special position, which is not found everywhere. These cold scholars are not as numerous as other people who call themselves "masters" or "madams." In terms of qualifications, they are mostly intellectuals. Furthermore, in terms of clothing, even though their shoes and hats are incomplete and their hair is very long, they still wear a long gown. Wearing a gown seems to have invisibly become a unique symbol of the cold scholar. As for being mostly intellectuals, it just shows that they were not originally lowly people, but because of their improper behavior, they have fallen to this state. Therefore, their number is naturally not large.

Among them, there seems to be an invisible organization. They investigate clearly which family has a happy event and which family has a funeral, and they all know each other. Some people say that they collude with the so-called "messengers" who specialize in delivering invitations and the so-called "helpers" who temporarily help out in the neighborhood, which is probably true. When they go to people's homes, they don't go empty-handed, but always bring a small gift. The host will definitely return this gift if they can, and they also have to give a large sum of money as "respect money." Regardless of the amount of this "respect money," they always have to argue for more and dislike less, and they argue even more fiercely for some upstarts and those whose family background is not very clear. If they don't get what they want, they will shout loudly at the door, revealing the secrets that the host doesn't want to publicize, in order to blackmail them. As a result, the accountant or the helper usually comes out to mediate and add a few coins to settle the matter. However, it is always about giving before taking, which is naturally more elegant than begging empty-handed, so the status of the cold scholar is far above that of ordinary beggars.

The family background of the cold scholars used to be very good. Their ancestors or fathers had been officials and made fortunes. In their childhood, who didn't live in luxury? Some had donated officials, wore official hats and peacock feathers, and sat in green sedan chairs. Some had traveled overseas and were proficient in foreign languages. Still others could write poetry and paint, and their speech was elegant. However, they were all addicts, first to opium, then to red pills, and even to white powder, which made them stay in the world of inhaling smoke and exhaling mist all day long. When all their property was turned into opium, red pills, and white powder and consumed by themselves, they shamelessly changed their profession to become cold scholars.

Becoming a cold scholar requires a good family background, so their number will naturally not be very large. Because they used to have a very good family background, they naturally have many relatives and friends who are still doing well. Therefore, they not only go to the homes of people who have weddings, funerals, or celebrations to beg in disguise, but also go in and out of various teahouses to "ask for help" from relatives and friends. "Old in-law! This nephew really can't make it today, please help me!" "Brother! Little brother begs for brother's well-being, please help me today no matter what!" We used to often hear such words in teahouses. The one speaking was the cold scholar, standing on one side of the table. Those "old in-laws" and "brothers" were entangled, and the only result was to spend money. Before the War of Resistance, one could give a beggar only a few copper coins, but one had to give them at least twenty cents. When they complained about the small amount and argued for more, and after a long time of haggling, the old in-laws would shake their heads and sigh, "Alas! He doesn't learn good things, he has lost all the face of his ancestors!" In fact, these cold scholars have no good plans for themselves, let alone thinking about their ancestors! There is only one thing, their words are very elegant, such as "a gentleman is steadfast in poverty" and "wealth and honor are like floating clouds to me"... These are all clichés, used to let others know that they are indeed from a scholarly family. If their ancestors knew, it would be comforting to them!

Wang Bu's "Anecdotes from the Worm Hermitage" says: "During the Wanli period of the Ming Dynasty, a wealthy monk of Tianning Temple passed away. Those who went to pay their respects were generously given gifts, each called 'travel expenses.' A man named Zhong from the local village imitated him. There was a scholar named Qiu, whose physique was like a dwarf. People called him Qiu the Stubborn. He was not acquainted with the deceased, but for the sake of the gift money, he prepared a gift and went to pay his respects, going several times a day. The bereaved family was surprised and asked, 'When the deceased was alive, I never saw you come and go?' Qiu said, 'The dead man knows it in his stomach!' Those who heard it burst into laughter. From then on, people always went to offer congratulations or condolences at weddings and funerals, waiting at the door and sending servants in to urge them, even demanding more money, going back and forth several times, losing all sense of shame, not as good as beggars. After Qiu died, those who inherited his mantle were all descendants of old families, aimless idlers, who still considered themselves gentlemen. This custom remains unchanged to this day. When the common people encounter these people, they call them Qiu the Stubborn. There are also funeral worms in Kunshan who are similar." The Qiu the Stubborn mentioned here seems to be more elegant than the cold scholars, because he still has a servant to follow him. However, it is these not very elegant cold scholars who have died a lot in the last ten years. The quality of those who have succeeded them has gradually declined. It is difficult to talk about family background or knowledge anymore, and there is no longer much distance between them and ordinary beggars.

### After the Snow (Photography)

### An Inch of Territory, An Inch of Blood 159

— Ye Jingfeng

"Vladivostok...Haha...Vladivostok is already in Japan's bag, how could it be considered a Soviet stronghold?"

"Alright, then let's talk about Chita." I urged Tsurumi to continue.

"Since Chita is the last railway stronghold of the Soviet Union, the Japanese regard this stronghold as the forward station for the first secret station against the Soviet Union. And the real active forward station is Harbin, also known as Binjiang."

"How about the arrangements?"

"That's a military operation, a battlefield of great espionage warfare between the two sides; they are all using White Russians."

"This is only one of the eight secret stations, what else?" I was a little afraid of his rambling.

"Hmph...there's another city called Tacheng; I'm afraid you'll be even less inclined to believe it, isn't that right? That's the forward station, the main station is actually Dihua in your esteemed country! The branch station is Suiding."

"Okay, I believe you; what else?"

"This is to deal with the Soviet Union. To deal with the United States, the main station is in Manila, and the forward station is far away in Hilo, Honolulu; for England, there are Sydney, Hong Kong, Singapore, and Calcutta; for France or the joint Anglo-French, there are Rangoon and Haiphong. Because we need to make up the number 'eight,' Hong Kong and Haiphong are only counted as one mixed station, with a considerable number of plainclothes and small-line operatives, but only one person in charge."

"Maybe that's the 'one-eight' secret that Pingzi mentioned?" I made a small conclusion to this speculation.

"Maybe it's not that simple."

Just as we were about to continue our research, we suddenly heard two knocks on the door. The doorknob moved, stopped for about a second, and then the door opened. I saw "Zero Four" walking in, holding a coded telegram in his hand:

"Reporting, received at four twelve."

Tsurumi only glanced at the code, and then slammed it on the ground:

"Bastard!" Tsurumi seemed to be losing his temper. I knew that Tsurumi was not willing to be so willful. Although his temperament was not very gentle, he was tolerant and never showed such anger, especially in front of his subordinates. This time, he failed in Tokyo and was entangled by Pingzi in a way that he couldn't get rid of, and he became irritable. His scolding was irrelevant, and "Zero Four" thought that he had said the wrong time and stood there dumbfounded.

Just as I was about to tell "Zero Four" to leave, Tsurumi suddenly burst into laughter, reached out and patted "Zero Four" on the shoulder, "Good friend, it's not your fault, go and listen, I'm afraid there will be another telegram." As he spoke, he sent "Zero Four" out the door and even gave him a bow.

I picked up the telegram and took a look. It was sent from Tokyo, and according to the code, it was simply written:

"Support secretly, pay attention to 'eight,' 'Zero Five One Three One.'"

Tsurumi took the telegram from my hand and looked at it again, so hard that it seemed that the code paper hid some special secret:

"Eight..." Tsurumi read this word again calmly, "Old brother, I think this is not a telegram from headquarters, it must have been sent separately by 'Zero Five.' Maybe it's a message that he overheard from headquarters, and he thinks it's important, so he specially notified us, but why is it so simple?"

### Fingerprints Everywhere, Evidence Complete. Those Who Take Advantage of Disaster Will Not Escape the Law!

……Talking About "Fingerprints" and Solving Cases……

In the investigation of crimes, fingerprints are considered the most powerful evidence. The recent Westmore Road fire investigation committee has also discovered fingerprints on the chopped wardrobe, which are considered the fairest and most reliable evidence. It is expected that these evildoers will not be able to save their heads! Here is some common knowledge about fingerprints:

Many people think that fingerprints can represent a person's personality, but fingerprint experts are not numerologists. They only want to find evidence of crime in fingerprints. However, experienced fingerprint experts can sometimes guess the person's gender, body shape, and general occupation from fingerprints. But what they are based on is only experience. For example: the thickness of the money strip can determine gender; the folds and scars of the skin can determine age; the size of the entire pattern can determine body shape; as for occupation, the nature of certain jobs can indeed be revealed on fingerprints.

Classification of Fingerprints

The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation stores 105 million fingerprint cards, enough to represent 60 million people. And when they receive a fingerprint card, they can determine within 36 hours, even within a few minutes, whether there is an identical one in their files. This seems impossible, but if we know their classification methods, we will not be surprised.

There are only seven types of fingerprints: loop, arch, tented arch, whorl, central pocket loop, double loop, and a shape made up of two or more of the above six types. The most common is the loop, which looks like many hairpins nested together and bent in the same direction (usually towards the little finger). The next most common is the whorl, which is made up of many concentric ellipses, or like a clock spring. There is also the arch, whose lines are raised in the center and separated to both sides.

In this way, the classification work is not difficult to complete. First, divide all the fingerprint cards into several groups according to their similarity, and then divide each group into several subgroups, and so on, until only hundreds of thousands of cards are left in each unit.

But the fingerprints in each unit are not absolutely identical. Because there is only one person in the world who has the same fingerprints as you; and that person is yourself.

So, how do you distinguish similar fingerprints? This requires focusing on small details, but although they are small details, they are extremely important. If eight details match a certain fingerprint, and the relationship between the items is also the same, then the identity verification is considered legally established. These details include: the edge of the finger spring line, irregular circles, dots, branching lines, etc.

Therefore, in court, fingerprint experts must prepare at least two enlarged fingerprint photos; one belongs to the victim, and one is obtained from the crime scene. The same details on each sheet are marked with the same numbers next to them. In this way, the law only needs to check whether the details with the same numbers are the same, and can determine whether the defendant is innocent or guilty.

The Great Wisdom of Creation

As for why we effortlessly leave our fingerprints on everything we touch, we have to admire the great wisdom of omnipotent nature.

If you carefully examine an enlarged fingerprint photo (or dip your finger in white powder and then gently wipe it off), you will find many white dots distributed on the lines. These dots are the openings of sweat glands, and the sweat secreted from them is the natural, best printing fluid for the complex rubber stamp on the finger! What is even more wonderful is that these sweat glands accelerate the secretion of sweat when the nerves are tense, making the fingerprints left behind clearer, for example, when committing a crime!

But because sweat is colorless, fingerprints cannot be seen with the naked eye; other substances must be used to display them. Thanks to scientific progress, we have many methods to display and preserve fingerprints.

The most common method is to use powder. In an emergency, almost any fine and clean powder can be used, such as face powder, flour, and cigarette ash. However, to get the best results, you need to use special powder.

Iodine vapor is also often used. When crystalline iodine is heated, it produces purple vapor, and when this gas encounters invisible fingerprints, it displays the fingerprints due to chemical reactions; but the time left is very short and must be immediately captured into the lens.

The camera for taking fingerprints is very similar to an ordinary large camera, with a flat-headed conical lens installed in front of the lens. When taking pictures, stick the flat end of this lens to the object you want to photograph, and then press the aperture. When the aperture is opened, the battery in the lens box automatically lights up at the same time, making the fingerprints particularly clear.

Fingerprints can also be removed as needed. Transparent cellophane tape (also sold in Shanghai) or thin rubber clothing can be used. When using, evenly stick the tape on the fingerprint dipped in powder, and then gently peel off the tape, and the fingerprint will remain on the tape.

The fingerprints obtained from ordinary crime scenes are only a few, but the classification method used by the investigation bureau is based on ten fingers, so the Federal Bureau of Investigation or other institutions sometimes cannot determine the owner of one or several fingerprints, even if he has a file in the bureau, unless he is a major bandit, then the bureau will use another classification method, classifying according to each finger.

Everyone Leaves Fingerprints

So, if you have a suspect and fingerprints, it is easy to determine whether the fingerprints belong to the suspect, but if you only have fingerprints and no suspect, then you cannot find the criminal.

So, someone suggested that everyone in the world should have their fingerprints taken and filed. If this is implemented, it would be much more convenient to defend against crime and espionage. (Excerpted from the October issue of Scientific Digest)

### Lantern Festival (Sheng Zha Zi)

— Liu Sui

Last year on the Lantern Festival,

Victory had just been won;

Returning from demobilization in a hurry,

Cocktails everywhere.

This year on the Lantern Festival,

Index at seventy-nine hundred;

Relief without proper follow-up,

People thinner than fried dough sticks!

### Fire Trees and Silver Flowers Like Last Year, Chaos and War Disturb the Lantern Festival!

— Xiao Rongshi

The Tang poet said in a poem about the Lantern Festival: "Fire trees and silver flowers meet, the star bridge and iron locks open; dark deer follow horses, bright moon chases people. Courtesans are all lush plums, traveling singers all sing 'Fallen Plum'; the gold crows do not prohibit the night, and the jade drips urge each other"! This poem depicts the grand occasion of the Lantern Festival, with endless beautiful scenery. Looking around the Jiangnan region today, on the Lantern Festival night, the celebrations with lanterns will still be the same as last year, with loud drums and trumpets, filled with an atmosphere different from songs and dances!

But when we look at the "beacon fires," "cannon flowers," and "chaos and war" outside of Jiangnan, smelling the "smell of gunpowder," and seeing groups of refugees drifting everywhere, we feel infinite "heartache"! It is precisely: "Fire trees and silver flowers like last year, chaos and war disturb the Lantern Festival."

### Is the Standing of Eggs Related to the Beginning of Spring?

— Junzhi

According to reports these past few days: eggs can stand upright at the beginning of spring, and a Chinese scientist in America will publicly demonstrate it, and so on.

At 8:30 PM on the second (definitely not the time of the beginning of spring), I mentioned this matter unintentionally, and I used a friend's words to prove it—he had stood two eggs upright last year at the beginning of spring—and thus. The betting began. Five minutes later, an egg began to stand upright on the table. This aroused my suspicion, but the fact was right before my eyes.

What is going on here? The answer is physics. Everyone should know the physics saying: "An object will not fall down if the vertical line from its center of gravity is within its supporting surface; otherwise, it will fall down." So, the ability of an egg to stand upright is precisely because it meets the above conditions. "Conditions for an object's stability: 1. Low center of gravity; the lower the center of gravity, the more stable the object. 2. Wide supporting surface; the wider the supporting surface, the more stable the object." Therefore, the chance of an egg standing upright is small (only at one point on the large end and one point on the small end) due to the narrow supporting surface; the chance of the large end standing upright is greater than the small end because of the height of the center of gravity. As for the upright standing and the season, I think it is completely irrelevant.

You wise readers might as well try it; you will probably not be disappointed! But it doesn't necessarily have to be at the beginning of spring.

### Look at Others, Think of Ourselves: Talking About Travel as Spring Arrives

— Zhongqi

Talking About the Holiday Travel Life of Americans

In 1947, experts estimate that 60 million Americans will take holiday trips. Americans are willing to spend large sums of money on this kind of luxury travel. This year, tourists will spend approximately 100 billion US dollars on transportation, food, lodging, souvenirs, film, luggage, clothing, and other items. One hundred billion dollars is used to improve the efficiency of various transportation means: railways, airlines, highways, and sea routes are all extremely conveniently connected to various places; vehicles, hotels, parking lots, seaside bathing areas, etc., have all been renovated; everywhere, damaged and outdated equipment has been replaced with the latest.

This year, the majority of travelers will be driving private cars on the highways, making America's highways even more crowded. Cars of all shapes and sizes are lined up in rows on the wide highways, forming a spectacular sight. However, the authorities are very concerned about their safety and have issued warnings: "If you are not confident that your car is safe, leave it at home."

There are also many passengers flying on commercial airlines. New types of aircraft are focusing on speed and capacity. The DC-8 aircraft is produced to meet this need. The interior is luxuriously equipped, and it has a speed of 300 miles per hour, saving passengers time. Some airlines have overnight flights with comfortable seats and berths, complete ventilation equipment, and ample lighting.

Buses solve the travel difficulties of many people. This year, thousands of new buses have been added to the service. The bodies are large and light (aluminum), and their mobility is extremely high. Bus fares are low, so they are very popular, especially among group travelers.

In addition to being slower than airplanes, trains have the advantages of all other modes of transportation, such as low fares, suitability for long-distance travel, and a very low probability of accidents. The equipment in the train is also as luxurious as possible. Sitting in the seat is like being in the living room at home, the bedrooms are comparable to high-end hotels, and the dining service is even better than ordinary restaurants.

It seems impossible for Chinese people to travel by car (including private and public buses) because the road infrastructure is not perfect and safety along the way is lacking. Air travel has become a cause for concern due to recent consecutive accidents. Train travel, sadly, except for the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines (which are extremely crowded), the rest have been "looted" to the point of utter destruction.

With the spring sunshine bright and the flames of war everywhere, can the Chinese people even think about travel?

### Philosophical Musings

Puppet Shows and Kites

The puppet faces us, dancing lively and very realistically, while people above are controlling it with strings.

The kite floats steadily in the air, higher than everything, while people below are controlling it with strings.

The Sun

In natural phenomena:

There is the darkest darkness, which we already know. But what about the brightest light? We still don't know.

You think it's the sun? True, our knowledge only goes that far.

The Moon

He should be ashamed of being praised; what brilliance does he have himself? He boasts of himself by borrowing the light of others, yet people are always willing to be deceived by him.

The Stars

Stop making faces; they are just little people hiding in the dark.
