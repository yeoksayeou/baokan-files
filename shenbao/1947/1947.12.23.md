### Amendments to the Organization Law of the Five Yuan; Legislative Yuan to Hold Extraordinary Session Today for Deliberation; Zhang Qun to Visit the Yuan to Explain Salary Adjustment Issues

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 22nd] The Legislative Yuan has scheduled an extraordinary session for the 23rd to discuss important cases such as the Amendment to the Organization Law of the Five Yuan and the Civil Servant Salary Adjustment Plan. In addition to concurrently President Sun presiding in person, the Vice President of the Control Yuan will attend to explain the Organization Law of the Control Yuan. Premier Zhang of the Executive Yuan will also be invited to visit the Yuan at around 11:00 AM to explain matters related to adjusting civil servant salaries. It is unprecedented for the heads of three Yuan to attend on the same day, and the atmosphere at the meeting is expected to be extremely lively. Furthermore, concurrently President Sun instructed during the meeting on the 22nd that the revision of the Organization Law of the Five Yuan and other important laws must be completed quickly to complete the legislative process, as the 25th marks the beginning of constitutional governance. In addition to holding a general meeting on the morning of the 23rd, another meeting must be held before the end of the year. In January, due to the need for most members to return to their original constituencies to campaign, the session will be adjourned several times. The national general budget for the first half of next year will only be discussed after the session resumes.

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 22nd] The issue of civil servant salary adjustments was raised again at the Legislative Yuan meeting on the afternoon of the 22nd. Liu Guanshun proposed temporarily that Liu Zhiping, who participated in the Salary Adjustment Committee, report on the progress of the meeting. Mr. Liu stood up and reported that the committee had held six meetings, and the heads of the five Yuan unanimously agreed with the principles proposed by the Legislative Yuan. The technical aspects of the salary adjustment had been discussed in detail and concrete decisions had been made. Premier Zhang had expressed his support for the Yuan's proposal when he returned from the north. However, since the proposal was put forward, three months had passed, and the need to adjust civil servant salaries was urgent. He did not know whether Premier Zhang was aware of the suffering of civil and military personnel. If he was aware, why had he not sought a solution earlier? Whether Premier Zhang's promise that day could be fulfilled, all these questions needed to be explained by Premier Zhang. He suggested inviting Premier Zhang to the Yuan to explain. Furthermore, the civil servant salary adjustment matter will be discussed at the State Council meeting on the 26th. If the decisions made are unsatisfactory, we will make further representations. After Mr. Liu's report, the meeting agreed that the matter was important and decided to invite Premier Zhang to the Yuan to explain at the extraordinary meeting on the morning of the 23rd.

White, the U.S. Foreign Property Disposal Officer, in Shanghai on August 30th of last year, the rest were signed by Wang Shoujing, Director of the Materials Supply Office of the Materials Supply Committee of our Executive Yuan in the United States, with Lonnie, Deputy Chairman of the U.S. Foreign Property Disposal Committee, and Martin, General Manager, and Sherwood, Secretary of the U.S. Export-Import Bank in Washington, between June and August of last year under Song's direction.

### Clearing of Pre-War Deposits and Loans; Balancing the Interests of Banks and Depositors; Liu Tong Explains the Review Process of the Regulations

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 22nd] The Regulations on Clearing Pre-War Deposits and Loans of the Banking Industry have been debated and approved on the 20th. It is argued that this plan is not very good, but it is difficult to find a better solution. The reasons are as follows: 1. The outbreak of the war was unpredictable and cannot be attributed to any one party, so there is no way to determine who should bear the responsibility. 2. Both parties suffered losses during the war, so both parties should be taken into account. 3. As far as the current situation is concerned, if favoring depositors, the banking industry cannot afford it, and the result will inevitably be bankruptcy. If ignoring the interests of depositors, and profits soar after the war, the banking industry enjoying excessive benefits is also unreasonable. These regulations take both parties into account and are not far from fair. 4. The amount of money that the banking industry has not yet repaid is known to be 4 billion, and there are still many unknowns. With such a huge amount of money and loans from the banking industry, if not resolved early, disputes will inevitably arise, which is detrimental to both parties. 5. The application of Article 12 of the Supplementary Regulations for Handling Civil Litigation after Recovery by the court varies from place to place, which is not a unified method, and only increases disputes and is not a solution. 6. The currency was quite stable before the declaration of war. Since then, various situations have changed, and the currency value has tended to fall. Taking the pre-war period as the standard is not without basis. 7. Current accounts and fixed deposits are different, because current accounts can be withdrawn at any time, while fixed deposits cannot be withdrawn. Separating the interest of the two is also reasonable.

### Newly Appointed Three Legislators; First Time Attending Yuan Meeting

### Kuomintang Central Commemorative Week; Qin Dechun Reports on Military Affairs

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 22nd] The Kuomintang Central Commemorative Week was held this morning at the Central Party Headquarters. After Committee Member Dai Chuanxian led the ceremony, Acting Minister of National Defense Qin Dechun gave a military report. Mr. Qin first described the recent situation of suppressing bandits, saying that the communist bandits in the Northeast had launched the seventh offensive with more than 200,000 people, attacking Kaiyuan, Liaoning, and western Liaoning in three directions. Their attempt was to cut off the northern route and isolate Shenyang, but due to our adequate preparations, their failure will be no different from past offensives. The remnants of Liu Bocheng's bandits in the Dabie Mountains have established a base, threatening Wuhan and destroying the attempt to disrupt traffic, which has also been eliminated by the encirclement of our large army. The bandits have now dispersed. The remaining bandits in Hubei and Henan are also being intercepted and thoroughly eliminated by the National Army. Mr. Qin also reported on the resettlement of demobilized officers. More than 280,000 demobilized officers at the general, colonel, and lieutenant levels have been respectively retained, transferred, or retired, and the procedures have been completed. Secondly, the salaries of military personnel have been adjusted according to the ratio of salaries for civil and military personnel since August, and the lives of military personnel have been greatly improved compared to before.

### U.S. Drafts Aid to China Plan; Relevant Departments Are Reviewing It Seriously

[Reuters, Washington, 22nd] State Department personnel are carefully reviewing a draft plan for aid to China that has already been drawn up. As of today, the review has commenced by relevant government departments (including the Budget Bureau, etc.). The aid to China plan will be included in President Truman's message on January 6th. Due to criticism from the Republican Party and the dispute over the amount of foreign aid, it is expected that President Truman or Secretary of State Marshall will issue a separate statement on China policy.

### Yu Hongjun Discusses U.S. Aid to China; Military and Economic Aid Should Be Given Equal Emphasis

[Associated Press, Nanjing, 22nd] Finance Minister Yu Hongjun stated that unless both military and economic assistance to China are given equal emphasis, neither form of assistance can truly take effect. It is said that the surplus military supplies to aid the National Government's army are of limited value unless the soldiers' salaries can be raised and morale can be boosted. With insufficient equipment, the government troops are fighting with the communist army. The communist army will continue to disrupt traffic and disrupt the national economy. During this period, single economic assistance is mostly irrelevant. Yu also said that if huge military expenditures continue to be paid, the hope of stabilizing the currency in the first step is very slim. What we do to ease the currency flood is to justify production, increase taxes, reduce expenditures, and increase domestic income. In fact, reforming the currency system is certainly necessary, but if the root cause of the currency flood cannot be eliminated, issuing a new currency system or changing the value of the current currency will make the problem more complicated and useless.

### Compensation for Civilian-Operated Goods at Compensatory Prices; Applications Can Be Issued Immediately; Gu Baochang Claims Compensation Materials Can Be Used

[News Report] Yesterday, a reporter inquired about the issue of evaluating and selling Japanese compensation materials for civilian use to Gu Baochang, Director of the Industry Department of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, who came to Shanghai on official business. He said that the price of the compensation materials sold to civilian factories will be determined by the Valuation Committee. This committee is actively being organized and will be formally established soon. This committee includes nine members, including three from the Ministry of Economic Affairs, two from the Ministry of Finance, two representatives from national industrial groups, and two representatives from national commercial groups. Invitations will be sent out soon. The principle of installment payments has already been determined. The detailed methods and the signing of contracts are yet to be supplemented in the future. The application forms for allocating compensation materials have already been drafted and are currently being printed in large quantities. They will be distributed to municipal governments and industrial and commercial guidance offices in various places in the near future, and factories can apply according to certain procedures. Since the first batch of compensation materials is working machines, the application method is for each factory to apply individually. The application method may change when the entire equipment is shipped. Gu strongly denied the point that most of the external compensation materials are unusable old items, and pointed out that this is a theory with ulterior motives. Its purpose is nothing more than to obtain compensation materials for free. Gu said: "As far as I know, only one-third of the first batch of materials are lacking parts. Our country does not intend to accept them. In the future, the value of this part can still be deducted from the total compensation value after calculation. It does not mean that after winning the lottery, you will be forced to accept it. The purpose of the government's priced sale of compensation materials is to increase the national treasury. If it wants to obtain it for free, the government can allocate it to the Ministry of Communications and the Resources Committee, and there is no need to target civilian factories." Regarding the request of 24 shipyards in this city to contract for the Japanese Kawashima Shipyard, Gu believes that if the factory's equipment is transported to China, it can be contracted by private shipyards, but at present, the method of obtaining compensation materials has been changed to lottery, so there is no way to be sure in advance.

### One Belgian Plane Comes to China, Crashes Yesterday in Kunming, Ten Missionaries from Vietnam Seriously Injured

Guangzhou Dancing Girls Request Postponement of Dance Ban Again

[Our Newspaper, Guangzhou, 22nd] Regarding the issue of banning dancing in Guangzhou City, the city government previously extended the deadline to the end of this month as the prohibition period.  As the deadline approaches, dancing girls have been continuously holding meetings, appealing for a delay in the ban and petitioning the city government to extend it to the end of September next year, following the example of other cities.  Their reasoning is that the training period for dancing girls is too short, making it impossible for them to change professions.

Eastern European Countries Plan to Form a Strong Bloc to Rival the Marshall Plan; Berlin to Become the Focal Point of Political Struggle

[United Press, London, 21st] Today it was learned that Eastern European countries within the Soviet sphere of influence are currently forming a strong bloc, striving for Communist domination of Europe and preventing Western countries from gaining leadership. This can be seen in the talks of foreign ministers, ambassadors, and other important figures of Eastern and Western European countries. They predict the development of the situation next spring as follows: Given the de facto state of division in Germany, Eastern and Western European countries may re-adjust their foreign policies to promote various new regional defense alliances, not only to resist Germany's re-emergence of aggression, but also to resist any future aggression. In the Balkans, the Soviet satellite states will intensify the integration of their political and economic life with the countries of the Danube Basin, including Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, Albania, Romania, and Hungary. Mutual assistance and friendship treaties are about to be signed, further abolishing trade and tariff barriers, and coordinating national reconstruction plans, ultimately aiming to establish a large federation. According to a European foreign minister, after communist countries consolidate their political and economic ties, they can unite 80 to 90 million people. At that time, a new country will emerge in Europe, and under the leadership of the Soviet Union, a plan for the reconstruction of Eastern Europe will be drafted to undermine the Marshall Plan and strive for political advantage. Another British official said that the Danube may become a river close to the West, while the world's richest triangle between the Adriatic Sea, the Black Sea, and the Baltic Sea will be integrated with the Soviet Union. The breakdown of the London Four Foreign Ministers' Conference may trigger a political battle for Berlin. The Soviet Union will follow the West German movement and advocate the establishment of a German central government based in Berlin, spiritually appealing to the German people to organize groups to rival the Frankfurt government. The battlefield for the governance war between the Eastern and Western sides of Europe lies in Greece. The Soviet Union's next action seems to be the establishment of a "Free Greek Government" in the mountainous areas of the northern border province, led by the Communist Party.

Developments in the Middle East Situation Worry Turkey

[United Press, Istanbul, 21st] The Turkish government is visibly anxious about the political developments on both the northern and southern borders of the country. Yugoslavia has been negotiating with Poland and Hungary to conclude a 20-year mutual assistance treaty. The official response has not been stated, but it is being closely watched. The same is true for the conflict between Jews and Arabs in Palestine. Since Turkey voted in favor of the partition of the Holy Land at the United Nations General Assembly, it has consistently adopted a policy of non-intervention; applications from journalists to go and cover the news have also been rejected. Some observers believe that Turkey's major concern about the Middle East crisis is that this matter may allow the Soviet Union to use the excuse of maintaining order to send troops to Palestine, causing Soviet troops to approach Turkey's borders from both the north and south.

Important Status of Frankfurt, the Future Capital of West Germany

[United Press, Frankfurt, Germany, 22nd] This somber city in Hesse has stepped onto the world stage due to the breakdown of the London Four Foreign Ministers' Conference and may become the future capital of West Germany. At first glance, this seems to be a misunderstanding, as Frankfurt only has the coldness of an ordinary industrial city. Even though it did not suffer severe bombing during the war, it has neither the shady avenues of Washington, D.C., nor the charm of Paris, the glory of Rome, or the tradition of London. However, there are various advantages. Frankfurt is centrally located among the major cities of West Germany, close to the intersection of the US, British, and French occupation zones. The population of the three zones is about 46 million. Although it has been through war, there are still many houses. The US military headquarters and the Anglo-American Joint Economic Council are both located here, and it is a hub for air and rail transportation. A total of 360 trains enter and exit daily, and it is possible to reach Paris, Brussels, Copenhagen, Vienna, and Berlin overnight. In addition, Frankfurt has a long history and deserves to be a symbol of the future West Germany, it is not just luck.

The Soviet Union Controls North Korea, Cannons Pointed at the US-Occupied Zone, Impressions of a British Journalist's Visit

[United Press, Seattle, 22nd] After arriving here by plane from Tokyo, Gordon Curnane, a well-known reporter from 20 British newspapers, stated that the Soviet Union has strategically defeated the United States in Korea and that internal strife will occur in Korea in March next year. The failure of the US military to enter northern Korea to expel the Soviet troops was a mistake. For the future threat of the Communist Party, there is almost no other way but to withdraw. Mr. Curnane inspected the demarcation line between the north and south zones of the 38th parallel last Wednesday and witnessed Soviet cannons aiming at the US side. After a short stay in Seattle, Mr. Curnane will fly to New York and arrive in London on Tuesday to spend Christmas.

He expressed a warm welcome to the Truman-Marshall aid to Europe plan and assured that Britain would fully cooperate.

Tojo Exonerates the Japanese Emperor, Declares that the Pacific War is Not Related to the Emperor, and Claims to be a Meritorious Anti-Communist in the East

[Reuters, Tokyo, 22nd] Former Japanese Prime Minister Tojo testified in the International Military Tribunal for the Far East today, not proving his innocence but denying that he should be held responsible for deciding to declare war and all actions after the declaration of war. However, he did not shirk responsibility for the treatment of Allied prisoners of war during the construction of the Burma Railway. Tojo accused the Allied countries of absolutely instigating the war and forcing the United States to participate in the European conflict. He also said: "The Emperor is completely innocent of the declaration of war. The Emperor has a spirit of love for peace. The decision to go to war in December 1941 was made by the Cabinet ministers and the Supreme Command Headquarters and has absolutely nothing to do with the Emperor." He also explained that Japan's opposition to communism was to save East Asia from the threat of Bolshevism. He also said that the situation two years after the end of World War II shows how important the anti-communist barrier is to world peace.

[United Press, Tokyo, 22nd] Foreign Minister Togo Shigenori, who was in office during the Pearl Harbor period, admitted in military court today that he and Tojo reported to the Emperor on the response to President Roosevelt's message on December 7, 1941, without consulting with elder statesman Kido, but he loudly denied that Japan was merely a "puppet rubber stamp."

US Economy Faces Crisis, Truman's Economic Advisory Committee Submits Report, Advocates Formulating a High Production Plan

[Reuters, Washington, 22nd] The second annual report submitted to President Truman by the Economic Advisory Committee of the President was released today, stating that if the United States wants to avoid the cycle of prosperity and depression and achieve lasting and stable balance, it must suppress the prices of industrial products, accept smaller profits, and balance the equality of wages and income distribution.

Rather than creating short-term prosperity through unbalanced expansion and excessive investment, it is better to make continuous and fully balanced use of the nation's productive resources. Short-term prosperity will inevitably be followed by wasteful periods of unemployment, factory closures, and liquidations. The report calls on the government and Congress to formulate a concrete plan for the highest degree of production that is visible and perceptible to the people. It also said that intensifying production cannot solve the problem of how to maintain the minimum production level alone, but only brings the country face-to-face with the question of what adjustments should be made to prices, wages, and property values ​​to create a lasting and stable internal balance. The report stressed that for the sake of establishing reasonable profits on a universal scale, the prices and profits of many industrial products must be suppressed, and the imbalances of the wage structure must be adjusted. The completion of these goals is the most sublime test of the American business community. If economic stability is to be achieved within the private enterprise system, management must accept more practical responsibilities when drafting investment and operating plans. The report concludes that facing the economic problems we face today, such as inflation, high living costs, and other retrogressive threats, our conclusion is that any monopolistic control over any part of the American productive capacity must be terminated.

The Potential of Japanese Underground Organizations Should Not Be Ignored

[Reuters, Tokyo, 22nd] The so-called problem of underground government continues to occupy a place in Japanese newspapers and magazines. "Tokyo Mainichi Shimbun" claims that the recent large-scale carjacking incidents in various places were all done by retired soldiers, because each action was meticulously planned and implemented in a very systematic way, indicating the existence of an underground retired soldiers' organization. It is said that these retired soldiers are organized into groups according to their military academy years and secretly store military weapons for future use. They initially intended to avenge the shame of defeat, but later realized the changing social situation. Now, compelled by the economic crisis and severe inflation, they have formed strong gangs or contacted frustrated politicians. In other words, the enemy of the Allied forces during the war has now become an opponent of the democratic government. The newspaper also said that although underground governments do not harm national welfare during the Allied occupation, their potential impact should not be ignored.

[Reuters, London, 21st] Rome Radio broadcast: Nenni, the leader of the left-wing Socialist Party of Italy, delivered a speech in Rome, strongly opposing the Truman Doctrine at the Socialist Party conference. If Italy succumbs to the United States, it will become a battlefield for the Third World War. Nenni also said that Italy must solve three main problems: the import of raw materials, the export of manufactured goods, and the emigration of people abroad. The Marshall Plan can only solve the problem of raw material imports and cannot solve the other two problems.

Shanghai Becomes a Center for Opium Trafficking and Manufacturing, There Are Still 30,000 to 50,000 Secret Drug Users in the City, Military and Police Join Forces to Form a Detective Network and Step Up Checks on Land, Sea and Air

[Our Newspaper Reports]阮光銘, Administrative Director of the Municipal Police Bureau and Director of the Opium Suppression and Investigation Institute, hosted reporters from various newspapers in the city at the new location of the institute, 99 Sinan Road, at 3 PM yesterday.劉學海, Special Commissioner for Opium Suppression in the Shanghai-Suzhou Area of the Ministry of the Interior, also attended. First, 阮氏 reported on the general situation of the implementation of the opium suppression policy in the city since its inception, stating that the Opium Suppression and Investigation Institute was established in April of last year. At that time, due to limited funding, it was first attached to the Police Academy. It was not until November 10 of this year that it moved into its new location. Currently, the institute has investigated and dealt with 5,308 opium addicts, including 3,483 males. However, 阮氏 estimates that in addition to those who have already registered for investigation, there are approximately 30,000 to 50,000 opium addicts in the city who still do not know how to reform and secretly use drugs. In order to thoroughly eradicate opium, the institute is giving them a final opportunity to register with the Shanghai Branch of the Opium Suppression Association or the various district offices for investigation before the end of this year. Otherwise, once arrested, they will be severely punished. Then, Special Commissioner 劉 addressed the audience, stating that according to central government laws, the opium suppression work in the city should have been completed by the end of this year, but based on the current situation, it will inevitably be extended again. At the same time, the central government's opium suppression laws will also be revised. 劉氏 continued to state that Shanghai has now become a center for opium trafficking, transportation and manufacturing, so the opium suppression policy is particularly important. In the past, the Police Bureau has achieved great results in investigation work, and should be strengthened in the future. 劉氏 also revealed that the city will soon establish an opium detective network jointly by military and police agencies, which will conduct strict inspections in the three aspects of land, sea and air. Finally, 阮氏 led reporters to visit the living conditions of the male and female drug suspect who are currently under investigation at the institute. The visit ended at around 5 PM.

New Interpretation of the Universal Principles and Virtues - Yan Qun

The Doctrine of the Mean states: "There are five universal principles in the world, and three ways to practice them. They are: the relationship between ruler and subject, between father and son, between husband and wife, between elder and younger brothers, and the interactions between friends – these five are the universal principles of the world. Knowledge, benevolence, and courage are the universal virtues of the world; the way to practice them is one." These words are the foundation upon which our country's social order and ethics have rested for thousands of years. I would like to offer a new interpretation based on my limited understanding and invite scholars to examine it.

"Universal" means accessible and unblocked, like a road; a universal principle is like a thoroughfare. "There are five universal principles in the world" means that there are five paths that all people in all directions share. These five are also known as the five relationships, which, in modern terminology, are called "relationships." It means that humans develop their potential within these five relationships. Although political systems differ between ancient times and today, with rulers and the people holding different positions, this is merely a difference in form. In essence, the relationship between the country and its people has never changed. Therefore, the relationship between ruler and subject is the relationship between the country and its people. The relationship between father and son, husband and wife, and siblings are family relationships; as for friends, that is a social relationship. Therefore, it is said that human relationships encompass the country, the family, and society. By fully developing one's nature and talents, and bringing these five relationships to a state of perfection, the country will be well-governed, the world will be at peace, and humanity will advance.

The means to practice these universal principles are the universal virtues. Universal virtues are the innate abilities that all humans receive from heaven, inherent in their nature, and belong to the inner self. The universal principles, on the other hand, are the paths that humans tread in the universe after they are born, belonging to the external world. By practicing these universal virtues to carry out these universal principles, one fulfills one's heavenly duty and accomplishes human affairs. Knowledge as a virtue is the ability to distinguish right from wrong, good from evil, and thereby understand ethics; benevolence as a virtue is the ability to empathize with each other, sharing joys and sorrows, and thereby nurture human relationships; courage as a virtue is the ability to strengthen this empathy and persevere without giving up. In short, knowledge is the ability to discern, benevolence is the nature of empathy, and courage is the power to act. Without knowledge, one cannot see the correctness of ethics; without benevolence, ethics will dissipate; without courage, ethical actions cannot be carried out.

Zhu Xi commented on knowledge, benevolence, and courage, saying: "Knowledge is for understanding this (referring to the universal principle, note by Zhou); benevolence is for embodying this; courage is for strengthening this." The term "embodying" is like the colloquial term "comprehending" or "being considerate," meaning to put oneself in another's shoes, achieving empathy. In modern terminology, it is called "sympathy." Sympathy comes from the Greek word "Sunpatheia," where "sun" means "with" or "together," and "Patheia" is rooted in "Pathein," meaning feeling or receiving. Combined, it means "sharing feelings," the so-called sharing of pain and joy. In this way, one feels as if one is of one body with another. Therefore, when discussing human relationships, the significance of the word "benevolence" indicates that individuals, though distinct, connect with each other in their hearts, as if they were one. Zhang Hengqu's saying, "Treat the people as my siblings, and all things as my companions," can be said to reveal this as clearly as the sun and moon.

Furthermore, in ancient times, there was the saying "serve the ruler as one would serve one's father," transforming filial piety into loyalty; therefore, the ruler was also called "ruler-father." There was also the idea of "treating subjects as one would treat one's children," so subjects were also called "subject-children." Thus, the country was regarded as a family, and the people treated the country as if they were in a family. Therefore, the ancient kings governed the world with filial piety, and the emperor had the saying "the family rules the world." As for interactions between friends, the Records state: "If one is twice the age, treat them as a father; if ten years older, treat them as an elder brother; if five years older, follow them closely." (Book of Rites, Qu Li) The father's peers are addressed as uncles, and the children's peers are addressed as siblings. Thus, society is like a family. This is not to privatize the nation or narrow the scope of society; rather, it is to regard the nation and society as one family, so that the people love and care for each other, share joys and sorrows, and empathize with each other. This is the essence of benevolence in Confucianism.

"There are three universal virtues, and the way to practice them is one." What is this "one"? Zhu Xi considered it sincerity, which is correct. The following passage states: "If one in a lower position does not gain the trust of those above, the people cannot be governed; to gain the trust of those above, one must have faith in one's friends, otherwise one cannot gain the trust of those above; to have faith in one's friends, one must be obedient to one's parents, otherwise one cannot have faith in one's friends; to be obedient to one's parents, one must reflect on oneself and be sincere, otherwise one cannot be obedient to one's parents." The so-called gaining the trust of those above is the business of the ruler-subject relationship; having faith in one's friends is the business of the friend-friend relationship; being obedient to one's parents is the business of the father-son relationship, extending to the business of the husband-wife and sibling relationships; and the ultimate path to obeying parents lies in reflecting on oneself and being sincere. Gaining the trust of those above, being obedient to one's parents, and reflecting on oneself and being sincere – from this, it can be seen that while carrying out the affairs of the five relationships through the paths of knowledge, benevolence, and courage is essential, if one does not consistently apply sincerity, it will be of no avail. Sincerity is what we call "being serious" in colloquial language. "Being serious" implies responsibility. Understanding principles must be true, which is the work of knowledge; after understanding the principles, one must proceed with a genuine and conscientious attitude, which is the work of action. When knowledge, benevolence, and courage all stem from sincerity, then one's knowledge will be undoubtedly true, one's pursuit of benevolence will be undoubtedly genuine, one's exercise of courage will be undoubtedly appropriate, and one's application to the affairs of the five relationships will be undoubtedly complete.

### Regional Design: A Blueprint for a Prosperous Nation and People - Li Chunfen

The prosperity of a nation and its people depends on construction, and the success of construction depends on the quality of planning. National construction is not like building castles in the air; it must be based on the actual environment and involve planned development. This means that the scale of national construction must be based on regional construction, analyzing the actual environment of each region, identifying the specific problems and needs of each region, and developing various plans to serve as the foundation for regional construction. Only in this way can we create a blueprint for national construction and deeply root the foundation for the prosperity of the nation and its people. Therefore, regional planning is an essential step in regional construction or development.

The Nature of Regional Design: Many regional designs use political regions as spatial units, which is not practical. While a country's resources vary by region, their distribution is also uneven. Moreover, within a country's borders, the terrain, climate, hydrology, land use, and local customs do not suddenly change with the crossing of county or provincial boundaries. Therefore, plans for development and rational utilization must be tailored to local conditions. In other words, design and policymaking should align with actual natural or economic regions. From a geographical perspective, regional design and development involve overlaying a new layer of human construction on the natural environment of the region, harmonizing the distribution patterns of the two. Therefore, all factors related to regional prosperity and their interrelationships must be thoroughly analyzed and comprehensively studied. This means that the design of all construction projects must be based on the inherent characteristics of the region itself, determining not only the content of the design but also the spatial scope of the region. If political regions are used as design units, a cohesive entity will be fragmented, and the development of the entire region or the resolution of problems cannot be comprehensively planned. As a result, fragmented efforts will lead to neglecting some aspects while focusing on others. Sometimes, conflicts of interest may prevent problems from being resolved, leading to endless disputes.

The Geographical Foundation of Regional Design: As mentioned above, the nature of the region itself determines the content of regional design, and each region has its own unique characteristics, so the design projects will also vary. However, design and policymaking are always based on the geographical background. All natural and human elements within the region, both dynamic and static, are objects of research and investigation. This includes land, power sources, products, transportation, population, cities, and so on. Each element must be thoroughly analyzed and studied in terms of its nature, distribution patterns, and the ways it affects utilization or is being utilized. It is essential to understand whether the utilization of resources within the region is in harmony with the natural environment, whether resources are being used to their full potential, and whether there is waste or misuse that leads to adverse consequences. Excess and deficiency are not signs of a healthy and rational system, and they require improvement or re-planning to ensure that resource development and utilization have a harmonious relationship with their direct environment.

Regarding the dynamics of human elements, such as population migration, factory relocation, and commodity transportation, the design should guide these trends in a way that integrates them into the normal trajectory. It should maximize efficiency under the principle of benefiting the entire region, rather than allowing them to develop on their own and letting nature take its course. In addition, problems related to the prosperity of the region that involve other regions should also be considered comprehensively. For example, if a coastal commercial port is experiencing excessive expansion, leading to overcrowding and traffic congestion, the solution to these problems requires coordination with nearby cities and ports. This involves planning how to disperse the excessive population and making reasonable adjustments to the distribution of goods to avoid an imbalance and harm to urban health.

The Focus of Regional Design: The above discussion focuses on regional design for economic development, but the focus of design varies from place to place. Some designs emphasize political management, social welfare, economic development, or national defense. For example, in France, regional design focuses on politics to facilitate the management of political units, and the same is true in Siberia. Similarly, the redrawing of provincial districts by Mr. Hu Huan-yong and Mr. Hong in our country is also a regional design with a political focus. The United States is representative of those focusing on economic development, with the TVA being an example. The YVA and KVA being implemented in our country also fall into this category. The urban regional design currently prevalent in various countries aims to improve the living environment of cities and enhance the performance of various functional areas, such as preventing the occurrence of slum areas, reducing traffic congestion, and building new satellite cities to alleviate urban overpopulation. Its focus is on the social aspects. The so-called Garden City movement in England also has its focus here.

The Dynamics of Regional Design in Various Countries After the War: European countries were directly affected by the war, with many towns and villages destroyed and people displaced. In the Americas, especially North America, the increase in urban population has made housing a problem. Therefore, in the past two years, regional design activities in Europe and the United States have focused on the planning and development of towns and villages and solving the housing shortage. Central and local design agencies are working together to restore, expand, or rebuild existing towns and villages. In 1946, twenty-eight of the forty-eight states in the United States passed legislation on town construction. In the same year, the British Parliament also passed a law establishing new towns, with plans to build twenty new towns, ten of which are located near London, with the aim of dispersing the congestion in London. Although constrained by material resources, European countries are also making progress in town design. Construction plans for several towns in the Soviet Union were approved as early as 1945. France has also begun to actively promote town reconstruction plans. Italy established a joint design committee last year to oversee various plans for the reconstruction of disaster areas. Other cities, such as Warsaw in Poland and Rotterdam in the Netherlands, are also designing and striving for restoration. In the past two years, town design can be described as a surge of activity, reaching a peak.

### A Dangerous Figure? Bergson - You Wei

Henri Bergson, the modern French philosopher, is a well-known figure in our country's intellectual circles. His major works, such as "Creative Evolution," "Matter and Memory," "Time and Free Will," and "An Introduction to Metaphysics," have all been translated into Chinese. He was once passionately admired by our country's intellectuals, but now he seems to have been forgotten by us.

Although we have forgotten him, the French have not. After Bergson's death (he died in 1941), his works have become more popular. The number of people reading his work is increasing daily. All those who lean leftward in their thinking like to read his books. Bergson's admirers have shifted from academia to the streets. Therefore, the recent American political commentator Walter Lippmann called him "the most dangerous figure in the world."

Bergson, a dangerous figure! This cannot help but surprise us. His thinking is not left-leaning. He is not like the English philosopher Bertrand Russell, who still has some sympathy for the Soviet Union or communism. He rarely makes political pronouncements. He is also not opposed to religion. Where does his danger lie? His danger lies in his philosophy. In philosophy, he argues that everything changes, and everything exists in a state of constant flux, with nothing remaining static. The flow of time is creative, continuous, and cumulative, with each moment being different from the last. Under this argument, politics, society, religion, morality, and all customs and institutions naturally cannot be exceptions and must be subject to the changes of time. In other words, he advocates overthrowing the status quo. All those who are dissatisfied with the status quo and want to overthrow it are naturally drawn to him. Many French people are currently dissatisfied with the status quo, which is why Bergson is so popular, and that is where his danger lies.

I would not dare say that Bergson's thought is dangerous because there are many people who share his views. If it is dangerous, it only proves that thinking is powerful and can influence society or change existence.

### The Propagation of Population - Fang Zheng

It is inevitable that population increases geometrically. Because two becomes four, then four must become eight. The problem is that it is difficult for most people to imagine how fast the population can propagate when it increases geometrically. Unless a concrete example is used to illustrate it, it may be difficult for the average person to grasp the seriousness of the population propagation prospect.

Let us assume that the Chinese nation only migrated or originated in East Asia 5,000 years ago. Let us also assume that China's population has propagated at a constant rate from ancient times to the present. Even if this rate is very low, as low as an increase of only seven per thousand per year, that is to say, after one year, out of every 1,000 people, after deducting deaths, 1,007 people remain. This is equivalent to saying that in 100 years, 1,000 people will propagate into 2,000 people. The population only doubles in 100 years, and the propagation rate is not high because Western Europe increased this number in the 19th century, even though there were constant wars, revolutions, famines, and epidemics in Western Europe in the 19th century. In a backward area of the United States, Ruerto Rico, the residents of this island, although medicine is backward and the mortality rate is high, the annual propagation rate is 2.3 percent, that is, the population doubles in 30 years. 100 years is three or four generations, and the population doubles in three or four generations, which is not considered a high rate. But if we propagate at this rate, then even if our ancestors were only two people 5,000 years ago, then after 5,000 years today, our population would exceed 20 million billion, that is, 20 million million million people, which is more than 10 million times the population of the entire earth today. Some people yearn for a future world where there is no worry about food and clothing, but how much land would 20 million billion people need to live? Even if science advances, the entire land area of the earth (about 51 million square miles), regardless of ice, cold, heat, miasma, high mountains, and barren valleys, can be inhabited. To allow 20 million billion people to have a sleeping area of three feet wide and six feet long, unless the whole world is built like the 30-story buildings in New York City, with no gaps at all, our great nation will have a place to sleep. In addition to this, there is no place for eating, living, culture, and enjoyment. Such a world is naturally impossible.

Therefore, the population must be limited in any case, whether such restrictions are natural or artificial. In the past, natural restrictions on excessive population propagation were famine and war, disease and epidemics. Some people even believe that this is the main reason for progress or evolution, the so-called natural selection, survival of the fittest, and only then can the race progress. This evolutionary theory has long been untenable in the face of various facts in modern embryology. We hope that mankind can grasp its own destiny. Famine and disease should be banished from the world with the progress of science, and war is also hoped to be avoided. Limiting population propagation should be controlled by humans.

Past facts tell us that the birth control movement (artificial production restriction) has produced extremely bad results. This is the so-called Differential fertility. The more excellent the propagation rate is, the lower it is, and the more ignorant and poor, the higher the propagation force is. For example, the urban population statistics of the United States in 1935. The fertility rate for those with an annual income of over $3,000 was 0.46 (in other words, even if the fertility rate is doubled, it still cannot maintain the population from decreasing). The fertility rate for those with an annual income of $1,500 to $2,000 was 0.70; the fertility rate for those with an annual income of less than $1,000 was 0.93. Therefore, the urban population is not enough to maintain the population from decreasing, only those who are too poor to support themselves have a fertility rate as high as 1.43. The difference in education level is also the same. The fertility rate for college graduates is 0.57, the fertility rate for high school graduates is 0.77, and the fertility rate for elementary school graduates is 1.18. This difference in fertility rate, even if it can maintain the population equilibrium, can greatly affect the quality of the population, and this method of restricting the population is too costly.

The impact of differential fertility on the population can be illustrated by intelligence. According to extremely conservative estimates, as Haldane estimates in his book "Heredity and Politics," if the fertility rate of the upper class remains so low, and the fertility rate of the lower class remains so high, the average IQ of each generation will be 1 to 2 percent lower. Thus, in a few dozen generations, the absolute majority of all mankind will become idiots. Or some people do not believe that intelligence is entirely determined by heredity. But even from the position of environmentalists, he must admit that handing over the next generation to those who cannot support themselves, are ignorant and irresponsible parents, the education of the next generation is very problematic. If acquired upbringing can determine a person's intelligence, the result of differential fertility is still no different from that of heredity theorists. Thus, population policy is a very important issue in today's society. How to maintain the quality and quantity of the population to a perfect state is a problem that anyone who cares about the nation must pay attention to.

### Academic Forestry Talks - Zhang Qiyun

Provincial District Issues

There are currently two factions, for and against, on the issue of provincial district reform, and debates have already begun. The author is one of those who advocate shrinking provincial districts. Recently, I drafted an article entitled "Provincial District Review," which will be published in the 49th issue of Ideals and Times (in print), and re-studies the theory of shrinking provinces. Briefly, if one can carefully examine the intent of the Constitution, it is not difficult to dispel all the doubts of the opposition. The author deeply agrees with the intent of President Zhang Qun's speech, believing that establishing provinces is indeed one of the biggest issues in nation-building. Precisely because this matter is of great importance, it is necessary to be cautious in handling it, in order to gain the sympathy of the majority of the people. A reporter from Ta Kung Pao said that there is no need to list this as the first major event of constitutional governance in times of war and chaos, and it is not too late to implement it when peace and unity are achieved. The author would like to offer a further explanation, even if peace and unity have already been achieved, it still needs to be carefully reviewed by all levels of public opinion organs to complete the legislative procedures. It is absolutely not possible for the government to make partial reforms to provincial districts with a single order, otherwise, it will disrupt the process and inevitably lead to unnecessary disputes.

In 1931, the author drafted an article entitled "Basic Principles for Reforming Provincial Districts" (published in the Current Affairs Monthly), and its conclusion was that the reform of provincial districts must go through three stages: first, the preparatory period, second, the debate period, and third, the implementation period. There are currently at least five specific plans for reforming provincial districts (Hu Huanyong, Huang Guozhang, Hong Fubo, Lao Gan, Zhang Qiyun). The author has not yet seen the plan proposed by the Ministry of Interior's Fangyu Division. The preparatory period can temporarily be brought to an end, and now should be the beginning of the debate period. The National Assembly for constitutional governance is about to convene. The government should submit this case to the Assembly for discussion, summarize the opinions of representatives from various provinces, and first make a conceptual examination. If the principle of shrinking provinces is approved by the Assembly, a joint meeting of the Legislative and Supervisory Yuan should be convened to review the specific plan, based on public opinion, expert reports, and the views of colleagues from the two Yuan, to conduct research and consider it in detail. Then, a small group review meeting should be established to create a hypothetical regional map based on the discussion results, with a description attached. Then, the government will send it to the provincial assemblies of various provinces for reconsideration. The provincial assemblies will then consult the opinions of the county assemblies, discuss back and forth, and strive for perfection. Then, from the bottom up, the government will summarize public opinion and make judgments. At this point, the debate period will be over. After the formal legislative procedure is completed, the government can promulgate the new Anqu District map and order the simultaneous implementation throughout the country. The great cause of nation-building must make the people sincerely convinced before it can conform to the democratic rule.

New National Defense Theory

What is the impact of the rise of air power on the old sea power and land inspection? This is a prerequisite for today's discussion of national defense. Land power refers to the armed forces operating on land, with land fortresses as their base. Sea power refers to the armed forces operating at sea, with naval ports as their base. The area along the sea-Han can be used by warships to transport troops ashore, which is called the overlapping zone of sea power and land power. The air force's operations depend on land, sea, or both. Since the air force cannot be independent of the army and navy, air power can be regarded as an extension and expansion of sea power and land power. However, the air force has the greatest fluidity. The navy and army can assist each other very quickly with the help of the air force. Furthermore, using the air force to directly destroy the enemy's economic organization is erratic, and it seems to be a new strategy for the sudden rise of the military. The current military situation is that air power is still difficult to independently constitute a third type of armed force, but it is not easy to completely integrate it into the land power and sea power systems. The most significant impact of the air force is that it can converge the sea and land, making the clear distinction between sea power and land power no longer exist. As a result, the old three-element defense has evolved into a new one-element national defense. Recently, the governments of various countries in the world have reformed their systems, and the Ministry of Navy and the Ministry of Army have mostly merged to form the Ministry of National Defense, which comprehensively manages the three armies, in order to meet the requirements of the new era. As for the invention of rockets and atomic bombs, as well as the brewing bacterial warfare, I am afraid that the factors of position and distance in national defense will be reduced to nothing. This is not only a major revolution in strategy but also an unprecedented change in geography. The future of the world is truly difficult to predict.

Free Talk - Observations in the Old Capital - Fa Hui Ze Wen

The "Patrol Post Cars" of the Pingjin News are designed to facilitate the citizens' sending letters. Every day, they stop at certain stations for two or three hours at a fixed time. The stopping place is selected about one mile away from the nearby post office, so that people know the time to go to the car to send letters nearby, so as to save the trouble of walking. This was originally a good idea. However, the situation in the old capital is different from that of the bustling and densely populated cities outside. The distance between the post offices is mostly no more than two miles, and there is also a "Dao Di Postcard" in the middle, which can send plain letters, and there is no inconvenience in habits. Moreover, the patrol post car has a time limit, and the people have to wait, and still have to run the road (the stopping place of the car is in the David Center, which is quite far away from the households in the various lanes), so they don't pay much attention to it. It often stays for a long time, and no one asks about it. The military is of milk-white and oil-blue colors, which is very beautiful. The cabinets and seats in the car are equipped like a small house, and the people in the car are quite leisurely.

The "post kiosks" added at the critical intersections have very good business. The post kiosk is shaped like a cigarette kiosk, and also looks like an electric car ticket office. It stands alone, with a milk-white top and walls, blue-green lines, and the words "post kiosk" at the top, also in white letters on a green background, clean and beautiful. It is also full of poetic and artistic sentiments, making people think of painting on the wall of a tavern.

There are many American goods in Ping City, but the sales are not all booming. For example, cigarettes can be said to be a popular addiction. There are cigarette shops and stalls one after another on the streets and alleys, and there are colorful colors everywhere. However, most of the people passing by on the streets buy the exports of Shanghai companies. Only a few aristocratic American-style modern people think that American cigarettes are fashionable and occasionally patronize them. Therefore, cigarette stalls only have one-tenth or two-tenths of "Philips" and "Red Light" prepared, and listed on the upper layer, just to connect them. Shen cigarettes are densely layered, followed by Tianjin products, which are lower in price and quality, and small vendors like to buy them. Also, such as glass skin and glass silk products, except for cloth companies and new-style stores, they are rarely seen in ordinary city stores and stalls. Occasionally, combs and ribbons are listed on the stalls, but they are not welcomed. Local women also think that they are easily broken children's toys. Also, canned goods are indeed "cheap and good", but they are not well known by the public. Most people do not know the foreign languages on them, and they cannot open them.

(People in the old capital buy food and talk about safety first and then buy). Moreover, there are too many types, eating and using (such as shoe polish and insecticide) are all beautiful tin cans, I really don't know "what is sold in the gourd", "old Beijing" people look and leave.

The old capital mixed grains (coarse grains for the people) have been sold for 8,000 yuan per catty, and a large can of American dry powder (bean curd), weighing five pounds, is sold for 40,000 yuan. And the people in between only say that this can is worth 20,000 yuan, but they don't know what is inside. Its exquisitely packaged turkey costs more than two pounds per can, and it is deboned pure meat, and the price is only 50,000 yuan (live chickens in the vegetable market cost 50,000, 60,000, 70,000, or 80,000 yuan each, and the amount of meat is only a quarter of this can), but no one asks about it. Once a friend asked me, what does Turkey mean? I replied "turkey", then he exclaimed: "Turkey is poisonous, how can it be eaten?" I said that this is an American chicken, that is, the chicken for eating, and the quality is similar to Chicken in Western food, and there is no other difference, but he is still suspicious. Only milk powder and Cheese are very popular, and the price is also soaring, because there are many teachers, staff and students in the academic circles who are the main customers.

### Lonely Harmony - Bin Ru

There is a small beef shop here, specializing in beef snacks, such as beef dumplings, pot stickers, buns, beef tripe, beef soup, etc., which are all delicious and cheap.

Probably small shops are like this, from the boss to the guys, they are a family, and everything is very harmonious, making the customers who come to spend money feel comfortable sitting down. I often spend my time here.

There are also those fellow customers, rickshaw drivers, workers, vendors, who are all dirty, but looking at the large stack of banknotes they take out, in addition to filling themselves, they must be able to support other people, which is also a reassuring thing.

Sometimes I can see a foreigner who has had enough wine and comes to drink again. When he staggers into the door, the boss will definitely speak Shanghainese to him:

"Hello, hello, why haven't you come for a long time?"

The foreigner always nods with a smile and says:

"No money, no money, I don't come if I have no money."

It is authentic foreign Shanghainese, and then he takes out a 5,000 yuan legal tender. Without ordering, the shopkeeper takes it and calls to get a glass of Wu Jiapi. The foreigner divides it into three mouthfuls, drinks it all, wipes his mouth with the back of his hand, and then staggers away. He always turns his head and waves when he reaches the door, and says "See you tomorrow". He only leaves his own impression on others, and does not think about who is next to him.

This small shop also has a radio. Because the boss likes to listen to Peking Opera, he often receives Peking Opera records or broadcasts. One night the boss asked me:

"Do you also like to listen to opera?"

At this time, the radio was playing Yan Jupeng's voice, desolate, vicissitudes, which I thought was the best, so I told him: I also like to listen, but I don't like to listen to Ma Lianliang or Mei Lanfang, I want to listen to Gao Qingkui, I want to listen to Jin Shaoshan, and especially like Yan Jupeng.

When the boss heard my words, he couldn't help but sigh and said: "Ah! You are really a scholar, Yan is also a scholar, no wonder you prefer him, haha!"

In fact, the reason why I especially love Yan Jupeng is not because of his scholar background, but I always feel that his voice is used better than anyone else's. Every word is so tightly fastened (not just accurately bitten), and it becomes a powerful thing invisibly, deeply hitting people's hearts, and is very harmonious with this desolate, lonely, and colorful world.

### Judgment - Ge Chunliang

"Mr. Lawyer is the smartest and most wise person in the city, which everyone admits, without a doubt. One day, a young man in the crowd asked him, 'Mr. Lawyer,' he said, 'How did you become so smart and know so much?'"

"Good and accurate judgment." Mr. Lawyer said without fear, "I can say that it must be because of my good and accurate judgment!"

"Then, where did your good and accurate judgment come from?"

"I got that from experience."

"Then, where did your experience come from?"

"I got that from my wrong judgments!"

### On "Drilling" - Ji Yong

Zhang Duanyi's Gui Er Ji is an interesting book. Volume does not record the Taishi chair, one of the items, which says:

"The school chair of today (that is, the cross chair) is the ancient Hu bed. From the past, there was only a material sample, and the prime ministers and attendants all used it. Because Qin Shiyuan (that is, painting) believed in the national taboo for a moment, his turban fell. Jingyin Wu Yuan flattered the prime minister and came up with the idea of ​​making forty handles of lotus leaf trays, and rushed to the national taboo, leaving the craftsmen to add them in an instant, and all the prime ministers and attendants had them, so they were called Taishi style."

A chair is so small, and there is such a shameless fact, which is really unexpected. The power of Prime Minister Qin that day must have been known. However, the flatterers also understood the truth. Forty lotus leaf heads were made, and the prime ministers all had them. In my hometown, a gentleman hosted a county magistrate, and specially set up a table. When he sat down, he shouted: "The seat is prepared for the county magistrate!" Although the gentlemen did not dare to compare, they were unhappy. This is called drilling also has a way. Zhao Shi's "crowing and barking" to Han Tuozhou was too much. It not only shamed himself, but also made the descendants feel very uncomfortable when they saw it. Therefore, Wu Gongyuan is quite worthy of incense.

The first class has the first class of drilling, and it is mainly to "get my heart first". How did Qin Hui succeed? His magic weapon is "peace". He saw that King Kang had no intention of fighting anymore—if Emperor Qinzong was really welcomed back, how would King Kang be the emperor! So Yue Fei was a fool—he took the blame for the emperor and was scolded by the world. Later generations knew the danger of the Qin family, but they did not know the more dangerous and more evil of Gaozong. One of the items in the Gui Er Ji volume says:

"One day, Qin Hui was so bold that Emperor Gaozong's face was unhappy. Kui said, what is the matter that makes the emperor worried? He replied: There are 5 million branches of silk and cloth in Jiaoji. He said: The minister should take care of this matter for His Majesty. (According to the Song system, after the Jiaoji ceremony, the ministers must be rewarded, which costs a lot.) Suddenly one day he reported: I beg the forbidden city to give the minister four golden pots of wine. He will be declared on a certain day, Qin Yue Zhang Han two generals (should be Zhang Jun, Han Shizhong) to discuss matters. From the morning to noon and afternoon, he did not get an audience, but saw the envoy declared the royal wine to come, and his heart became more confused and surprised. He moved, Qin and Zhang Wei said, and did not say a word. Suddenly he said: Royal wine is given in front of the emperor, drink a cup together. Zhang Han was terrified and did not dare to drink. Qin first took a sip of wine and drank it safely. After a while, he slowly said: The emperor wants to give each of the two generals 10 million yuan to pay for the Jiaoji ceremony, and then allocate it after the ceremony. Zhang Fajijin ordered and reported to Emperor Gaozong, and he was ordered to lend only 500 thousand yuan."

After seeing Zhang Han's demeanor, I really feel unbearable. If that is poison, what is there to manage? But it also shows that Qin is not easy to mess with. In the era of warlords, many people used this technique to kidnap tickets. Of course, there are also those who stole the position by this method. Zeng Zhi's cleverness is deeply pleasing to the ear.

### Thinking of the Disaster Victims in the Cold of Winter

After a heavy snowfall, the weather in Shanghai has turned very cold. Although the sun has come out in recent days, the cold air remains strong. The Siberian cold wave reached Shanghai on the 15th, and the actual temperature dropped to minus 5.7 degrees Celsius. According to the astronomical observatory, such severe cold has not been seen in seventy years, except for 1925. It is predicted that this cold wave will continue to invade the city. Christmas and New Year's Day will both be spent in the midst of severe cold.

Severe cold may not be a seasonal experience for a certain group of people: they live in mansions with water heaters and fireplaces, and they can sit comfortably and travel quickly in new cars. They wear precious furs and fine jewelry. The cold weather cannot pose the slightest threat to them. Moreover, the colorful snowflakes and the snow-covered earth can be regarded as beautiful scenery for entertainment. With Christmas and New Year approaching, they are busy preparing food and wine, feasting friends, and engaging in lively celebrations. As for the general public, they are struggling under the high pressure of life, constantly striving for profit, and although they are deeply troubled by the hardships of the year, they are not at risk of losing their lives. The ones who are most bullied by the cold weather are the tens of thousands of poor and helpless disaster victims!

In any street and corner of the city, you can see disaster victims shivering with their arms folded: they are hungry all day long and poorly clothed. They "prostrate themselves on the ground" on the sidewalks, push tricycles on the bridge piers, stretch out their skinny hands to beg from pedestrians on the streets, and huddle together in hidden alleys. Especially when the night is deep and quiet, they huddle together in the vegetable markets and under the eaves, constantly suffering from the invasion of the north wind. Often, dozens of people die overnight. This is truly a tragic scene of human hell!

They are both citizens of Shanghai, but for one part, the severe cold is enough to enjoy and entertain, while the other part sacrifices their lives in the severe cold. This is truly a stark contrast.

In modern cities, it is a common problem that the rich get richer and the poor get poorer. In Shanghai, China, this situation is even more acute. The formation of these groups of disaster victims is nothing more than the result of the eight years of the War of Resistance against Japan, the victims of which have not yet recovered, and the cruel destruction by the communists during the two years of turmoil. North of the Yangtze River, which is not accessible from Shanghai, is disturbed by the communists and lurking local communists. Under their ruthless "liquidation," "struggle," "grabbing grain," and "joining the army" activities, the rich have become the targets of liquidation, and the poor have become the targets of coercion, causing the vast rural areas to fall into a state of production collapse and people displacement. People in these areas, without clothing or food, live from day to day, and turn to Shanghai in the hope of finding opportunities for livelihood and assistance. However, Shanghai not only did not give them job opportunities, but even did not give them a foothold, so their fate is unimaginable.

Of course, the fundamental solution to relieving disaster victims is to suppress the communists so that people can live and work in peace and contentment, and so that the vast number of farmers can return to the countryside. However, the work of suppressing the rebellion cannot be completed in the short term, and rescuing the dying and healing the wounded is urgent. Therefore, before the fundamental solution is completed, the partial rescue is the most urgent task at present.

Under the active promotion of the municipal government and people from all walks of life, the winter relief work in Shanghai has begun, and the following items are being held:

Charity performances are held in various theaters, which are expected to generate 20 billion yuan.

House rent fee, which can generate 30 billion yuan.

According to Mayor Wu's speech on the 8th of this month, 20 billion yuan has been raised.

The income from the above three items has reached 70 billion yuan, which seems to exceed the original target of 60 billion yuan.

As for the relief situation: Three shelters have been set up, which can accommodate 4,500 people in total, and more than 800 people have been received. Eleven work-relief shelters can accommodate about 3,000 people. The municipal government assists charitable organizations in setting up eleven porridge distribution points from January 1 of next year, which can provide food for 15,000 people every day. In addition, medical treatment and corpse collection are also being handled by public and private charitable organizations.

We assume that there are 70,000 disaster victims in Shanghai who are in urgent need of relief, which is a total of 70 billion yuan. Each person can get 1 million yuan in relief funds, and the three months of severe winter can be barely survived. However, it is still just the beginning. To achieve the above goals, we still need to work hard continuously.

We must point out that, in addition to the active promotion by the municipal government, those who are enthusiastically engaged in relief work are mostly small and medium-sized citizens, while the generous donations from wealthy merchants and tycoons are still not common. Relieving disaster victims is based on human compassion, based on compatriot love, maintaining social stability, ensuring the lives of people who do not want to be enslaved by the communists, and warming their spirits, which is also indirectly mobilizing for suppressing the rebellion. We hope that the government and the general public will complete the winter relief work with the greatest enthusiasm and perseverance, and we also hope that the rich can arouse their conscience, and that the municipal government will propose effective donation methods for the rich, and use their excessive wealth on the dying disaster victims.

Fang En's Report

Mr. Fang En, manager of the Asia branch of the United Press, held talks with senior Chinese and American officials in the city last week and reached a conclusion that if the United States announced a broad aid plan to the Chinese National Government to defeat the Chinese Communists, the Soviet Union would inevitably retreat and would not interfere in China's internal unrest or provide military assistance to the Communist army in Northeast and North China by force. The reasons he cited are as follows: Although the Soviet Union has provided the Chinese Communists with military weapons and ammunition seized from the Japanese army in Northeast China and Korea, and may still transport limited supplies to the Chinese Communists through ports such as Vladivostok and Dalian, the Soviet Union cannot risk a full-scale conflict with the United States in order to control Asia. If the United States announces a broad aid plan to the Chinese National Government, the Soviet Union will inevitably launch a large-scale propaganda offensive; however, China and the United States can formally point out that the Soviet Union has not only failed to comply with the Yalta Agreement to open Lushun and Dalian, but has also ignored the provisions of the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance, refusing to hand over the Lushun and Dalian to China, thus counteracting the Soviet propaganda offensive. China and the United States can also issue a joint declaration in the United Nations framework with other countries, pointing out that the Soviet Union's actions in Northeast China are enough to constitute a threat to peace. In this way, the Soviet Union can be defeated in the diplomatic offensive.

After reading Mr. Fang En's report, we suddenly realized that the United States still has some concerns about the issue of aid to China. It is not afraid of the opposition of the American people, but of the interference of the Soviet Union. Mr. Fang En's explanation is well-founded and reasonable in addressing this point. However, from our point of view, we believe that the United States' concern about the interference of the Soviet Union is completely unnecessary.

After World War II, the main players on the international stage are only the United States and the Soviet Union. The United States is committed to world peace everywhere. Whether in Europe or Asia, it hopes that peace can be achieved, so it always adopts a cautious and forbearing attitude. However, the Soviet Union only seeks its own security. Whether in Europe or Asia, it hopes to expand its power indefinitely and create a "safe zone" that is as stable as Mount Tai. The Soviet Union already has its iron curtain in Europe, and it also has its iron curtain in Asia. However, in terms of its focus, it is obviously more focused on Europe. The reason why the Soviet Union wants to organize the new Communist International, why it resolutely opposes the American aid plan to Europe, and why it adopts an uncompromising attitude at the London Foreign Ministers Conference, even to the point of willingly making the four-country foreign ministers unhappy, is entirely to expand the Soviet Union's power in Europe in order to compete with the United States. As for the Soviet Union's attitude towards Asia, although it also has the same ambitions and intentions, the situation in Asia is not entirely the same as that in Europe. The biggest difference is that there is China in Asia.

Although China today is experiencing internal turmoil due to the Chinese Communists' armed rebellion, the Chinese government not only can still control the entire country, but is also the only legitimate government. Its consistent diplomatic policy will not change due to internal problems. According to our country's basic policy, we not only wish to maintain friendly and close relations with the United States, but also wish to maintain friendly relations with the Soviet Union, as long as the Soviet Union can truly abide by and fulfill the obligations stipulated in the Sino-Soviet Treaty. Therefore, in any international conference, whenever the United States and the Soviet Union are deadlocked, our country always mediates between them and puts forward compromise proposals to reconcile the views of both sides. If the Soviet Union has no other intentions towards China, it seems that it cannot have unfriendly actions towards China. Moreover, China today is independent and complete, and its internal affairs do not allow interference from other countries. Therefore, the United States' aid to China does not need to take the Soviet Union into account in any case.

However, the crux of the Chinese problem lies in the Chinese Communists' armed rebellion, attempting to economically drag down the National Government; the hidden worry in Asia lies in the Chinese Communists' collusion with the Soviet Union to organize the Far East Communist International, attempting to gradually and completely bring the entire Asia under the Soviet Union's iron curtain. The American diplomatic authorities should recognize that the crisis in the Far East is enough to constitute a source of world turmoil and threaten world peace. They must not hesitate and hesitate any longer. There is an old saying in ancient China: "Hesitation leads to trouble." The time is extremely urgent, and aid to China cannot be delayed. We hope that the American authorities can pay close attention to Mr. Fang En's report!
