[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 15th] The great battle of Siping has reached its climax. Since the afternoon of the 14th, the Communist army has continuously bombarded the defending troops' positions from Xiaokagou in the western suburbs and the Lingshen Temple area in the southern suburbs with artillery.

The ground in front of the National Army's positions in the suburbs was littered with Communist corpses, and casualties were heavy. It is generally believed that the defense of Siping is only the beginning, and fierce fighting will likely continue. A high-ranking military official here told reporters today that the strong fortifications in the suburbs of Siping will destroy most of the invading Communist forces. These words have implied that the National Army's deployment and preparations may cause the Communist army besieging Siping to repeat the tragedy of their invasion of Dehui last winter.

Furthermore, the Wang Jingjiu Corps of the National Army, which advanced towards the northeast of Xintai, drove back more than 30,000 troops from the 1st, 7th, and 8th columns of the Communist army who had sneaked into the vicinity of Nanshidian on the 14th, seizing numerous war trophies.

### Xinjiang Incident Shows No Development; We Quietly Await Soviet Reply

### Border Security Measures Should be Proactive; Focus on New Transportation Lines

[Our Newspaper Report] Former Director of the Xinjiang Construction Department, Lin Jiyong, expressed his views on the Xinjiang incident, stating that border security should adopt proactive policies: (1) Two parallel railway lines should be built, connecting Xinjiang to Gansu and Qinghai respectively, creating a "double-track corridor." This would avoid the danger of the 3,000-mile-long Gan-Xin Highway being cut off at any time. If the construction of the railway is too slow to meet the need, a large number of aircrafts should be used to open up air routes. (2) Honest and capable officials should implement sound economic policies, with all measures aimed at enhancing the welfare of the people of the entire province, without any intention of competing with the people for profits.

### Requests to Protect Rights and Preserve Territory Continue to be Expressed in Various Places

### American Newspaper Comments on Xinjiang Incident, Sympathizing with Our Protest to the Soviet Union

[Central News Agency, Washington, 14th] Reports of the invasion of Xinjiang by Outer Mongolian troops have not yet caused a reaction from officials here. The State Department is currently awaiting detailed reports and remains extremely silent. The Washington Star's editorial this afternoon stated: "We have good reason to believe (as Nanjing apparently believes) that the Soviet Union must bear at least some responsibility for the Outer Mongolian invasion of Xinjiang. China's protest to the Soviet Union is not without reason. The action of that foreign business may, in imagination, be an action by the Kremlin to add to the difficulties of the Chinese government while it is fully dealing with the Communist Party. The Soviet explanation will be of concern and expectation to people all over the world.

### America Needs China's Tungsten Production; Government Stockpiling Policy Creates Tungsten Shortage

[Central News Agency, New York, 14th] According to people in the tungsten industry here, China is a major global supplier of tungsten ore, so it is very easy to regain the American market, because the United States is the country with the largest industrial use of tungsten. At the same time, recent reports have further confirmed this statement, because American industry is facing a serious tungsten shortage due to the government's stockpiling policy and lack of imports. The lack of tungsten in the United States has caused a sharp increase in tungsten ore prices, which have risen from US$23 per 20-pound unit to US$32 in the past six months (an increase of about 30%). Before the war, tungsten ore supplies from China, Burma, and Malaya accounted for 65% of the world's total. Since then, tungsten production has been concentrated in the United States and South American countries such as Bolivia, Brazil, and Mexico. China's tungsten exports have been greatly hampered by its efforts in warfare and transportation inconvenience. Recently, costs have risen sharply, and the American tungsten industry has adopted a tariff barrier system, so people in China's tungsten industry feel that it is impossible to make a profit from mining tungsten for export. Tungsten is resistant to heat and acid, so it is an important metal in both wartime and peacetime. In industry, tungsten is used to manufacture high-speed machine steel, tungsten filaments, and various power chemical products. In military terms, tungsten is used to manufacture armor plates and armor-piercing projectiles, so it is an important metal in military terms. The reporter learned from authoritative sources that the US government has stockpiled large quantities of tungsten ore seedlings and tin, and this inventory is kept for emergency use and is currently under the control of the Army and Navy Munitions Bureau. It is said that the US government intends to continue to store this important metal for the next five years, and they refuse to supply any inventory for commercial use. According to tungsten industry estimates, the United States consumed approximately 2.5 million pounds of tungsten in the first three months of this year. The current supply of tin in the American market is only enough for four Danes. The large-scale application of tungsten by American industry has created a huge gap between the supply and demand of tin. People in the tungsten industry here believe that if China's tungsten mines can adopt new methods and be sold at international prices, it can be a major resource for obtaining US dollars.

### Universal Suffrage is Determined to be Held as Scheduled; CCP Seems to Have No Intention of Reconciliation; Zhang Junmai Talks about the Situation after Returning to Shanghai from Beijing

[Our Newspaper Report] Zhang Junmai returned to Shanghai from Beijing yesterday and told reporters: "Regarding the unified interpretation of the constitution, it is being drafted by designated personnel. As for the determination of the peace plan, the National Affairs Conference's peace resolution will be passed and accepted at the next State Council meeting. The prerequisite for restoring transportation in the past three-party joint governance policy will be omitted, that is, the restoration of peace talks is unconditional. As long as the CCP is willing to talk, it can be started at any time. In addition, when I was in Beijing this time, I also contacted people about participating in the universal suffrage. Currently, various preparatory work, such as population surveys and printing election tickets, are underway. The government has decided to implement it in accordance with the National Assembly resolution and does not intend to postpone it. Negotiations on the ratio of the number of representatives from the Democratic Socialist Party and the Youth Party to the government are also underway. If we want all parties to jointly conduct elections, we should first agree on the ratio of representatives." After Zhang reported, reporters asked about the development of the situation, and he replied separately as follows: (1) The understanding of the situation of the Xinjiang incident is not yet sufficient, and it is probably a co-issue between Outer Mongolia and Xinjiang Province.

Complex Internal Communist Army; Tense Situation in Northeast

(2) There are Korean Communists and Japanese prisoners of war participating in the Communist offensive in Northeast China, and the situation is very serious. The Communist Party has an international character, so the seriousness did not start today. (3) Regarding the protection of human rights, I wrote to Director Zhang because of Fan Puji's arrest. In fact, Fan was not arrested, but only stayed on a farm outside Chengdu. Restoring freedom is only a matter of time. Some of the students and reporters arrested in various places have been punished, and the reporters are being rescued by the Information Bureau. The government has decided to temporarily suspend these emergency measures. (4) The current economic policy should focus on increasing production, and then foreign exchange can be obtained through exports. Although the civil war is ongoing, the area south of the Yangtze River is not affected by the Wu disaster and can still strive to increase production, especially agriculture. For example, the government is quite confident in improving cotton production. Zhang said that

It is still difficult to achieve peace at present, because the

Strong military, even if it agrees to the two prerequisites it requested in the past, it may not be able to turn hostility into friendship. Today, the CCP may not be satisfied with the nationalization of the army in the military reorganization plan.

Since the pacification of the East River, the Northern Expedition, the suppression of warlords, and the unification of China, up to the eight years of sacred and arduous resistance against Japan, countless of our past students have shed their blood on the battlefields and sacrificed themselves for the country, amounting to tens of thousands. Now, two years after the victory of the War of Resistance, the foundations of the country are precarious, the accumulated worries are piling up, and the suffering of the people is almost back to the time of the school's opening in 1924. The perilousness of the revolutionary environment, the arrogance of counter-revolutionary forces, the obscurantism of the Three Principles, and the widespread dispersal and bewilderment of people's hearts are even worse than they were then. As the saying goes, "If the way rises one foot, the demons rise ten." And, "Hardships and difficulties make jade." As the revolution reaches its final success, the obstacles to the revolutionary future, which await our destruction and clearing, will inevitably appear more stubborn and intense. Therefore, today and in the days to come, is the time for our final struggle, which is also the key to the success or failure of the revolution, the survival or demise of the country, and the rise or fall of the nation. Our graduates of past years, whether fighting bravely on the front lines or dedicating themselves to the work of building the army and the nation, on this important anniversary, must know that the country's worries, the revolution's difficulties, the devastation of our villages, and the suffering of our compatriots are all our own greatest shame. Whether the glory of Whampoa's history can be carried forward, whether the fruits of the victory of the War of Resistance can be maintained, and whether the spirits of the martyrs underground can rest in peace, are all the inescapable responsibilities of our hundred thousand students.

Cooperate Unanimously and Strive for Self-Improvement

Our school's motto is "Fraternity, Integrity, and Sincerity." Only with the spirit of unanimous cooperation and shared honor and disgrace can we speak of fraternity; only with the virtue of continuous self-improvement and unwavering honesty can we speak of integrity and sincerity. The main points that our students should strive to emulate have already been explained in detail by me on the 20th anniversary of the school's founding. What I want to emphasize to all my students today is our founder Sun Yat-sen's most essential teaching: "Establish revolutionary aspirations and emulate the actions of the martyrs." Every student must deeply reflect on whether our daily thoughts, lives, and actions are worthy of the revolutionary party's unwavering independence, selfless dedication, sacrifice for righteousness, and the spirit of overcoming setbacks. Whether our conduct, treatment of others, fighting, and governance can emulate the revolutionary martyrs and deceased students' fearlessness of difficulty, avoidance of danger, resoluteness, bravery, and having a "me against the enemy" attitude.

Carry on the Past and Open up the Future

Our cause depends on us to continue, the nation's peril depends on us to save, the party's disgrace depends on us to wash away, and the suffering of our compatriots depends on us to alleviate. Our position today is as loyal ministers and abandoned children. Our responsibility today is to carry on the past and open up the future. If we today do not succeed in the final struggle, we will be guilty of failing Sun Yat-sen, failing the glorious martyrs, failing the deceased students, failing the country and the nation, and deserving eternal condemnation. Time is running out, and where there's a will, there's a way. How can we encourage and save ourselves, follow the blood-stained footsteps of the martyrs, and clear the thorns to reach the goal of final success? Let all students think deeply, reflect profoundly, and put it into practice.

### Obstacles in the Yangtze River Channel Urgently Need Continued Clearance; Ministry of Water Resources Sends Letters to the Ministries of National Defense and Transportation

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] In the national water conservancy construction guidelines, the issue of Yangtze River water conservancy was clearly stated: "The Yangtze River management plan should focus on shipping and hydropower. In order to meet the needs of the country's overall economic construction, priority should be given to implementation." However, a large portion of the sunken ships and river defense projects from the war have not yet been cleared. It is understood that the obstacles affecting navigation on the Yangtze River were all set up during the war, such as mines, sunken ships, and rafts. The clearing of mines was handled by the Military Command Headquarters, while the salvage of sunken ships has been entrusted to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Ship Salvage Department by the Ministry of Communications. Recently, the Ministry of Water Resources again sent letters to the Ministries of National Defense and Transportation, requesting the organization of clearance and salvage work to prevent the silting of waterways and hindering navigation.

### The National Government Explicitly Commends Jamyang Sheypa and Master Taixu

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 15th] The National Government issued the following orders on the 15th: (1) Jamyang Sheypa, a master who assisted in the country's transformation and enlightenment, was refined and meticulous, with a pure and comprehensive nature. He promoted enlightenment and assisted the people, and the border peoples believed in him.

He should be explicitly commended and bestowed with the honorary title of "Assistant in National Transformation and Enlightenment, Righteous Awakening Illuminating Master" to show our recognition. (2) Master Taixu, deeply studied philosophy, with pure and outstanding aspirations and conduct. Throughout his life, he traveled extensively both domestically and abroad, promoting religious doctrines with great dedication. During the War of Resistance, he organized Buddhist rescue teams to serve with the army, and his loyalty to protecting the nation was particularly commendable. Now that he has passed away, we deeply mourn his loss. He should be explicitly commended to highlight his loyalty and integrity.

### The Nation Should Be Deeply Vigilant About Opening Trade with Japan; General Opinion of Various Circles in Shanghai

(This City News) The U.S. State Department announced that the U.S. will open Japan's foreign trade posts in mid-August this year. People from all walks of life here attach great importance to this. The opinions of various parties are collected and reported as follows: According to Xu Jiyun, the current chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce: Since General MacArthur took control of Japan, the results have been remarkable. China, affected by unstable conditions, is facing considerable obstacles in its reconstruction and development. Moreover, the problem of domestic raw material supply has not been fully resolved, and production is declining. In the future, with Japanese goods pouring in, the future of China's industry will face even greater crises. Xu continued: I was a student in Japan after the Sino-Japanese War and lived in Japan for a long time, so I know the Japanese national character better. Generally speaking, they are outwardly humble and inwardly treacherous, seemingly respectful but cunning in their hearts. Although Japan has been defeated, under the support of General MacArthur, its recovery ability is truly astonishing. We should be even more vigilant.

According to Liu Bingyi, Customs Commissioner of the Jianghai Customs: Japan's pre-war trade volume was not only a giant in the Far East, but also occupied an important position in the world. A review of the annual statistical tables of our country's customs and the world trade books will make this clear. China's current international trade is sluggish, and the trade deficit cannot be reduced for the time being. This has become an obvious fact. With the addition of this powerful competitor, the future is even more unthinkable. Although it feels too early to talk about Japan's restoration of foreign trade at this time, China's industrial and commercial circles must prepare in advance.

According to Wu Weijing, Deputy General Manager of the Textile Building Company: Although Japan currently has only 2.5 million spindles and produces 70,000 bales of yarn per month, it is impossible to dump large quantities abroad for the time being. However, Japan must first compete for the Nanyang market. This will inevitably hit our country's efforts to seek the southern transport of yarn and cloth. However, the potential for Japanese recovery is extremely strong. If our country does not take measures to surpass it in advance, we will inevitably fall behind in the future.

### Japanese Importers and Exporters Struggle on the Brink of Death

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 15th] It is estimated that as many as 7,000 Japanese importers and exporters are currently struggling on the brink of death. This is because General MacArthur's statement regarding the resumption of Japanese foreign trade assured Allied merchants that they could have unlimited contact with Japanese producers and provide these merchants with all possible conveniences in Japan. Japanese importers and exporters are afraid that once Allied traders enter Japan, they will seize the position of agents for Japanese importers and exporters. These unhappy importers and exporters told a reporter from the Central News Agency that they have no chance to compete with Allied merchants who have received MacArthur's promise to obtain all possible conveniences. On the other hand, Japanese exporters face the insurmountable difficulty of a lack of transportation, as well as the controls of the Allied General Headquarters' foreign trade organizations. Japanese exporters pointed out that Allied traders, with their access to transportation, have easier access to Japanese producers than Japanese exporters do. In addition, the Allied General Headquarters' foreign trade organizations, which control Japanese trade, will be more accommodating to Allied traders while ignoring Japanese exporters. Japanese importers and exporters fear that the era of their being refused to act as agents may be coming to an end.

### Due to Lack of Raw Materials and Sluggish Sales, Japan's Silk and Yarn Production Has Sharply Decreased, Reaching Only 30% of Pre-War Levels

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 15th] Japan's silk and rayon industries, along with the cotton and fishing industries, will be sources of national income. However, the rayon industry, like the cotton industry, is also facing obstacles, and sales are sluggish due to the rise of American-made nylon. Japan's raw silk industry is also slowly recovering to the world market. From December of last year to March of this year, Japan exported a total of 84,400 bales of raw silk (132 pounds per bale) to the United States, but only 20,000 bales have been sold. Japanese sources say that they will export 130,000 bales this year, but by mid-April, only over 2,000 bales have been exported. Japan's current raw silk production is 8,500 bales per month. According to the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, there are 876,500 silkworm farmers in Japan, with a total of 186,250 chō of mulberry fields. Last year, they produced a total of 32.49 million grams of silkworm eggs, and the silkworm contribution reached 18.21 million guan (one guan equals 8.28 pounds). According to American silk experts, no other industry in the Japanese economy can replace sericulture. Japan's current production of rayon and cotton yarn is only 30% of pre-war levels. Currently, the production of rayon is less than one million pounds, and the monthly production of cotton yarn is only slightly less than two million pounds.

### Seeking Stability Through Economic Revival

A Dedicatory Speech at the Opening of the Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East

The United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East solemnly opened in Shanghai this morning. Representatives from ten countries, including China, the United States, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, France, the Netherlands, the Philippines, Thailand, India, and Australia, have jointly arrived in Shanghai. Mr. Woven, Deputy Secretary-General of the United Nations Social and Economic Council, came to Shanghai from the United States specifically to preside over the meeting. The Chinese authorities, in recognition of the importance of this meeting, also had Foreign Minister Wang personally preside over the opening ceremony and deliver a speech on behalf of President Chiang. This is the first international conference convened in the Far East after the war. Its mission is to study the economic losses suffered by various countries in the Far East during the war, to provide suggestions on how to restore the economic situation of each country, and to establish normal economic relations between countries. However, its effect will not be limited to the economic aspect alone, and it will inevitably have a very important impact on politics as well. In today's world, where politics and economics are inseparable, political stability often depends on the resolution of economic problems; similarly, economic stability also depends on enlightened and progressive politics. Therefore, the establishment of the Economic Commission for the Far East in Shanghai this morning is of great significance, both in terms of the lofty ideals of the United Nations organization and in terms of the future of economic revival in the Far East. We feel particularly excited and earnestly expectant regarding the meeting of this committee, and we should first express our sincere welcome to the representatives of various countries who have come to Shanghai from afar.

Modern international warfare is truly a catastrophe for mankind. In particular, the Second World War caused even deeper suffering to humanity. The Sino-Japanese War was the prelude to the Second World War, so Asia suffered from the poison of war not only for a longer period than Europe, but also suffered greater losses than Europe. President Truman has proposed a plan to provide economic assistance to European countries in order to restore the economic situation of various European countries and prevent the collapse of the social economy of various European countries. However, the economic assistance plan for Asian countries has not yet been discussed; therefore, the people of Asian countries feel even more urgent about the establishment of the Economic Commission for the Far East. As far as China is concerned, from the July 7th Incident to the end of the victory in the War of Resistance, the losses of public and private materials are estimated to be no less than three hundred billion US dollars, not including the deaths and injuries of soldiers and civilians and the expenditure of national military expenses. Moreover, after suffering great trauma, China is now preparing to engage in post-war economic revival work, so in the future, whether in terms of materials or economics, the need for external assistance is self-evident. Requesting priority compensation from Japan is certainly a viable approach, and our delegation to Japan has also frankly stated that "China hopes to extract compensation from Japan's current production, and China needs to obtain immediately applicable materials from Japan." However, Japan's compensation capacity is ultimately limited and may not be able to compensate for all of China's losses, and the opinions of various countries on this Japanese compensation issue are divergent and have not yet touched the core of the issue. It is expected that the peace treaty with Japan is still far away. Under this situation, China cannot immediately obtain compensation from Japan, so naturally it can only hope that the United Nations Social and Economic Council can take effective measures to prevent China's social economy from falling into a state of collapse. At present, China's social economy is fraught with dangers and crises. On the one hand, it can be said that it is due to internal reasons, but on the other hand, it must be said that it is the result of the eight-year War of Resistance. The inability to eliminate the destructive forces of the Communist Party and the tendency to become bandits are fundamentally due to the fact that China's social economy has been affected by the long-term War of Resistance, creating an environment conducive to incitement by those who engage in destruction.

China's practical situation is indeed like this, and the same sad situation exists in other Asian countries. First, let's talk about India. Although Britain has provided a promise to transfer power to India early, creating a beautiful prospect for India, in terms of social economy, due to the internal conflict between India and Pakistan, disturbances have occurred in various places, and are still ongoing. In the future, after the partition of India and Pakistan, the terrible internal conflict may intensify, and the ultimate result will also be to bankrupt India's social economy. If the United Nations cannot face reality, prevent problems before they occur, and provide all possible assistance to restore it to normal, then the future of the Indian economy is not entirely optimistic. The next is Indonesia, which, after the end of the war, was stirred by the tide of the world, and raised the banner of national liberation, demanding independence and freedom from the Netherlands; as a result, another bloody tragedy was triggered, which has not yet been completely resolved to this day. Looking at the domestic situation, not only are families broken and fields barren, but also the East Indian Islands, which have always been known for their prosperity, are now harboring various crises in both social and economic aspects. The third is the situation in Vietnam, which is exactly the same as the actual situation in Indonesia. In addition, Myanmar, Thailand, the Philippines, etc., were all devastated by Japanese imperialism during the war, lost their vitality, and have not yet been able to restore their former appearance.

Just looking at the above few simple descriptions of the sad faces of the people of Asian countries after the war, we can have a simple outline. We are not afraid to alarm the ten country representatives and emphasize the crisis of the social economy of various Asian countries, but we sincerely hope that the Economic Commission for the Far East can investigate the actual situation of various Asian countries on the spot, so as to prescribe the right medicine and provide practical and effective suggestions on how to enable various Asian countries to quickly achieve economic revival, so as not to cause the inevitable economic panic after the war. As for the active aspects, how to increase the production of various Asian countries, how to improve the living standards of the people of Asia, and how to promote economic cooperation between various Asian countries, the Economic Commission must discuss a concrete and effective plan for this meeting.

In short, the establishment of the Economic Commission for the Far East has a very important significance, but its task is limited to providing suggestions. Whether or not the suggestions are implemented is in the hands of the countries themselves, and what Asian countries urgently need today is not empty plans, but material assistance and technical cooperation. Although the United Nations organization itself can also do its best, we ultimately hope that the United States' economic assistance plan can be expanded. At present, the United States is trying to provide economic assistance to European countries. We hope that the United States can broaden its horizons and never ignore the importance of Asian countries, and immediately extend its economic assistance plan to Asian countries. Therefore, how the United Nations organization can cooperate with the United States' economic assistance plan for Europe and Asia, so that post-war Asia can seek stability in revival, and post-war Asia can seek prosperity in stability, is the only issue facing the Economic Commission for the Far East.

### President Truman Signs Instrument of Ratification for the Four-Nation Peace Treaty, Emphasizes Friendship Between the American and Italian Nations, Criticizes Romania, Hungary, and Bulgaria for Failing to Establish Democratic Governments

[Reuters Washington 14th Telegram] President Truman today signed the instrument of ratification for the peace treaties with Italy, Romania, Hungary, and Bulgaria, and issued a statement at the time. His statement regarding the Italian peace treaty stated: "Some of the provisions of the treaty are not entirely in line with our wishes, and may be amended by the United Nations organization in the future as needed. The ratification of the Italian peace treaty has brought an unpleasant chapter in US-Italian relations to a close, and at the same time, Italy has entered a new era, allowing its people to look forward with hope and trust. The Italian military and civilians have made significant contributions in the task of defeating fascism and Nazism. The common sacrifices of the American and Italian nations have strengthened the friendship between the two sides. The United States is pleased to stand by Italy as the Italian people rebuild their democracy and restore their freedom in adversity. The American people are determined to continue to assist the Italian people."

His statement regarding the Romanian, Hungarian, and Bulgarian peace treaties stated: "I believe it is necessary to publicly express regret for the disregard of the majority of public opinion and the suppression of public opinion by the governments of these three countries. Since these three countries were liberated and reached the Yalta Agreement with the three powers, I have hoped that governments truly representing the people could be established in these three countries, but to this day, such governments still do not exist. However, for the benefit of the people of Romania, Hungary, and Bulgaria, the state of war that has lasted for more than five years between the United States and these three countries must be ended. The establishment of peace means that all occupying forces in various countries (except for the Soviet troops maintaining the transportation lines to Austria) will be withdrawn from their respective countries, and the control committees established under the armistice agreement will also be terminated."

[United Press Washington 14th Telegram] President Truman criticized the governments of Romania, Hungary, and Bulgaria for violating the public opinion of their own countries when signing the peace treaties with Italy, Romania, Hungary, and Bulgaria on the 14th. At the same time, he praised the Italian people and hoped that they would become a "strong, free, and democratic Italy." Truman's harsh criticism of the governments of the three Balkan countries came after US officials were planning ways to stop Soviet political aggression in Eastern Europe. US officials have changed their original intention of immediately appealing to the United Nations about the Hungarian coup, because if the Soviet Union is determined to prevent it, the United Nations and the United States will in fact be unable to do anything about the Soviet Union's actions in Hungary. US officials now feel that the most appropriate way is to first allow the treaty to take effect, and then wait and see the changes in Hungary and other places. According to authoritative sources: The United States has not yet formulated a plan for what actions to take in the Balkans in the future. At the same time, it is expected that the Soviet Union will reject the US request for the three powers to investigate Hungary.

### Within Ninety Days of the Peace Treaty with Italy Taking Effect, All British Troops Will Withdraw; The Two Countries Sign an Agreement in Rome

[Reuters Rome 14th Telegram] The United Kingdom and Italy have recently signed an agreement at the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, each in a sovereign capacity, to facilitate the withdrawal of British troops and to determine the status of British troops in Italy within ninety days of the Italian peace treaty taking effect. The agreement consists of four letters, including fourteen points, which will be published by the British government in the form of a white paper, so it cannot be announced at this time. However, it is learned that the provisions include: British troops will pass through Italian territory to Venice Giulia Province, British troops will continue to use empty houses in Italy, but British troops will engage in rapid withdrawal within ninety days. British military personnel are subject to the jurisdiction of British courts, and the Italian authorities will provide British troops with expenses, etc. It is known that the content of this agreement will lead the US authorities to anticipate that a similar agreement will also be established between the US and Italy.

[United Press Rome 14th Telegram] According to a British Embassy spokesman, there are currently only about 35,000 British troops stationed in Italy, the most being 500,000 during the war against Germany. British Ambassador Sir Charles signed the agreement on behalf of the British government and said that once British troops are completely withdrawn, the last symbol of the armistice period will be eliminated. Italian Foreign Minister Sforza also declared after signing that this agreement can symbolize the future relationship of British-Italian understanding.

### Vatican Newspaper Says Conflict Can Be Avoided

[United Press Vatican City 14th Telegram] The Vatican newspaper "L'Osservatore Romano" said in an editorial today that the conflict between communism and Western democracy is not inevitable, and there is plenty of room in the world to accommodate more than one way of life. What is especially important is that national theories must recognize that all ideals can coexist in the world. They must recognize this point, otherwise they will repeat "you die or I live."

### British Prime Minister's Speech Supports the United Nations Organization; The World Should Understand Its Importance

[Reuters Gilham Villa near Canterbury, England 14th Telegram] Prime Minister Attlee said in a speech today at a conference supporting the "United Nations Organization Association" that any future war is not only a matter of life and death for individuals, but also a matter of life and death for the entire culture. The Prime Minister asked, "Some people think that the world can continue to move forward in its old way, and once a crisis occurs, the United Nations organization can prevent the tragedy from happening. I do not believe that this is the way we can complete the establishment of the United Nations organization. We want to make the world recognize this United Nations organization, which is no less important than their own government, so everyone must use their reason to understand the problems handled by the United Nations organization."

### There Is Talk of President Truman Visiting Brazil

### President Truman Will Veto the Income Tax Reduction Bill

[French News Agency Washington 14th Telegram] Regarding the fact that the US Senate passed a financial bill under Republican influence, stipulating that income tax should be reduced, it was recently learned from responsible sources that President Truman will exercise his veto power before the evening of the 16th, so that the US treasury will not be depleted due to the reduction of income tax, and at the same time, so that President Truman's proposed economic assistance plan for Europe will not be affected. According to well-informed sources: When President Truman announces the veto of the bill, he will attach a statement, stating that the United States has a large-scale need to assist Europe and Asia.

### US Republicans Demand Greater Voice

[United Press Washington 14th Telegram] Secretary of State Marshall faced a problem today, namely the Republican Party's demand for a greater voice in reviewing US foreign policy, especially its plan to revitalize Europe with billions of dollars. Senate Speaker Vandenberg demanded the rapid organization of a special bipartisan advisory committee. There is considerable disagreement in Congress on this matter. Some Republican senators have expressed their doubts about the United States spending money abroad again. Republican Policy Committee Chairman Taft recently said that he will issue a statement on foreign aid programs and will convene a special meeting of the Economic Committee of the two houses on the 23rd to discuss all matters related to foreign spending. Marshall and his staff have not reacted to Vandenberg's plan, but even if they object, they know that it is quite difficult to deal with, because Vandenberg is the backbone of planning US foreign policy, especially in planning anything that "requires Congressional action". Moreover, the economic revitalization plan for Europe not only requires Congressional approval, but also requires the appropriation of billions of dollars. If Vandenberg's "price" for organizing a bipartisan advisory committee is cooperation with the economic revitalization plan for Europe, Marshall will likely support it.

### Soviet Union Rejects US Proposal, Opposes Three-Nation Joint Investigation of Hungarian Coup

[Our Newspaper] London 15th Broadcast: The Soviet representative of the Allied Control Commission has rejected the US request for a joint investigation by the three countries into the recent Hungarian coup, considering the request to be "interference in Hungarian internal affairs."

### Nagy Arrives in the United States and Makes a Statement

[Reuters New York 15th Telegram] Former Hungarian Prime Minister Nagy arrived at LaGuardia Airport from Geneva today with his family. In the airport reception room, a reporter asked what measures he expected the three powers to take regarding the situation in Hungary. He replied that the three powers had already won the victory in the war, which is an undeniable fact, but all major countries hope that after the signing of the peace treaty, no one will threaten the survival of their independent countries again. Strong countries should pay close attention to the situation in Southeast Europe. The political trends there have definitely threatened the safety, peace, and freedom of small countries, so when strong countries discover that the sovereignty of small countries has been threatened, they should immediately conduct an investigation. When asked how long he planned to stay in the United States, he replied that he could not answer at this time. He said that the main purpose of his visit to the United States was to make the United States and the world understand the situation in Hungary.

### Soviet Union Tempts Austria to Join the Balkan Group; Austrian Foreign Minister Criticizes the Communist Party

[United Press London 14th Telegram] According to a Paris telegram: Under the instigation of the Soviet Union, the Danube countries will convene a meeting in the capital of Romania, and Austria has also been invited, attempting to tempt it to join the brewing Balkan group.

[French News Agency Vienna 14th Telegram] Austrian Foreign Minister Gruber delivered a radio speech tonight, fiercely criticizing the Communist Party's attempt to subject Austria to the rule of a minority faction, and said that Austria has become the nerve center of the world's conscience. Attempting to place Austria under the rule of a minority faction is also attempting to destroy the system of international cooperation. World peace requires us to crush all attempts to implement dictatorship. We must not be subdued by force. Austrian Communist Party leader Fischer studied in the Soviet Union for many years and demanded close relations with the Soviet Union, which is unreasonable. In short, a free Austria will be born sooner than we expected.

### British Commonwealth Association Advocates Convening a Three-Power Summit to Solve the Problem of Atomic Energy Control

[Our Newspaper] London 15th Broadcast: The British Commonwealth Association, newly established and led by Churchill, issued a public letter today requesting Prime Minister Attlee to hold a summit with President Truman and Stalin as soon as possible to formulate a plan for atomic energy control.

Attlee's reaction to this proposal is not yet known.

### Regarding the Issue of European Economic Cooperation: France Submits Memorandum to the United States; French Viewpoints Are Quite Similar to Marshall's

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 14th] A person in charge here told an Agence France-Presse reporter today that the French Ambassador to the United States, Mr. Bonnet, submitted the French government's memorandum on economic cooperation among European countries to U.S. Secretary of State General Marshall yesterday. The French viewpoints are similar to those recently expressed by Secretary Marshall at Harvard University, it is said.

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 14th] Regarding the U.S. economic aid plan for Europe, after Secretary of State Marshall announced that the Soviet Union was also included, some people here were relieved. This is because they had initially expected that the Soviet Union would be excluded.

Britain and France Intensify Consultations on the U.S. Aid to Europe Plan

[Agence France-Presse, London, 14th] Mr. Alphand, Director of Economic Affairs of the French Foreign Ministry, will come to London early next week to discuss the aid to Europe plan proposed by Secretary of State Marshall with British economic experts. At the same time, British Foreign Secretary Bevin will also go to Paris to meet with French Foreign Minister Bidault. Thus, the economic cooperation between Britain and France announced by Foreign Secretary Bevin will enter an active stage. Britain and France had already begun consultations on the U.S. economic aid plan for Europe a week ago, and now both sides will jointly consider the best methods to adapt to the U.S. aid to Europe plan. Secretary of State Marshall should explain his aid plan in more detail, so that European countries can use this as a basis to formulate a joint statement on their needs. However, the problem that needs to be solved now is whether to contact the United States through various European economic and social institutions already established in Geneva, or whether the relevant European countries should negotiate directly with the United States. In addition, should the U.S. aid to Europe plan be a general aid plan limited to three or four years, or a plan that is easier to implement and only supplies urgent needs? A choice must also be made between these two.

After the arrival of the Chairman of the Committee, Mr. Sandström (Swedish), he said that the committee will hold a plenary meeting on Monday, then visit Palestine to familiarize themselves with the local situation, and then begin the investigation work. Although the Arabs boycotted the committee, all commissioners will visit both Arab and Jewish areas. "Even if the Arabs do not cooperate, we still want to understand the overall situation." Regarding the fact that the Palestinian Arabs notified the United Nations institutions on Friday night, stating that the committee is composed of representatives of small countries and is easily susceptible to Jewish pressure, so the Arabs boycotted it, Mr. Sandström said that if this statement is true, then the Arabs should present their case even more.

### Vitamin B Added to White Rice: People in the Philippines Are Testing Its Effectiveness

[United Press, Manila, 15th] More than 100,000 residents of the Bataan Peninsula have voluntarily replaced guinea pigs to participate in a test, the results of which may have a significant impact on hundreds of millions of people in Asia who mainly eat rice. Dr. Salsbury, Director of the U.S. Public Health Office in the Philippines, has invented a method of adding Vitamin B to white rice, and plans to use the test to determine whether this method can be practically adopted on a large scale to prevent beriberi. According to Dr. Salsbury, most people in the East whiten their rice, so it does not contain vitamins. He believes that at a cost of 25 U.S. cents per person per year, sufficient beriberi-preventing ingredients can be supplied to the entire population. The taste of rice does not change when Vitamin B is added, it is said.

### Acheson Condemns Soviet Union for Taking Unilateral Actions in Europe and Asia

[Central News Agency, New York, 15th] Mr. Acheson, the recently resigned U.S. Undersecretary of State, publicly criticized today the Soviet Union for pursuing policies that are completely contrary to the major premise of international coordination and restoration. Mr. Acheson pointed out that the Soviet Union's failure to return Dalian to our country is a clear proof of this. Mr. Acheson broke away from the diplomatic euphemisms commonly used and condemned the Soviet Union for taking unilateral actions in Eastern Europe, the Far East, the Middle East, and Greece. He delivered a speech at the graduation ceremony of Wellesley College in Middle Town. When he mentioned the Far East, he stated: In the Far East, the Soviet Union dismantled industrial equipment in the Northeast, hindered the political and economic unification of Korea, and failed to fulfill its promise to return Dalian to the Chinese government as a free port. All these actions have greatly delayed economic restoration and political stability, and have largely caused the prolonged poverty, suffering, moral decline, and border chaos throughout the Far East. Mr. Acheson also severely attacked the Soviet Union for obstructing the conclusion of peace treaties with Germany and Austria. Mr. Acheson explained why the United Nations often cannot follow the principles listed in its charter, saying that it is because the Soviet Union makes the United Nations a forum for intense, useless, and endless dialects. Under this policy of the Soviet Union, the United States can do and is doing many things. Mr. Acheson gave a detailed description of the meaning of the Truman Doctrine. He said: The United States has always supported people who are fighting to maintain their own freedom. He listed examples of the United States in this regard, and said: We have spent decades of effort to assist China in its struggle against foreign conquest. Mr. Acheson's speech was formally a praise of American policy in the position of the outgoing Deputy Secretary of State. He specifically reviewed the United States' attitude toward the Soviet Union and the clear evidence of the United States' good intentions. Mr. Acheson also telegraphed to the American people upon his departure, saying: The United States should not wait for the development of extreme crises, and should not attempt to assume all the responsibilities of the world, or solve all the problems of the world, but should thoroughly support and exert its own abilities and cooperative forces to win over those who seek freedom.

In addition, the bill will divide officials into two major systems, technical and administrative, which cannot be transferred to each other, in order to seek the fundamental reform of officials.

### Post-War Japan: Widows Abound; How to Handle Them Is a Head-Scratcher

[Central News Agency, Tokyo, 15th] Although Japan is committed to political and economic revival, there is a very important issue related to the future of the Japanese people that has not been considered at all, and that is the issue of wartime widows.

### Commemorative Meeting of the 36th Anniversary of the Recovery of Shanghai; Business Guild Comrades Pay Public Tribute to the Martyrs; Suggest Establishing September 13th as a Local Memorial Day; Speaker Encourages Citizens to Maintain the Traditional Revolutionary Spirit

[This Newspaper News] The Shanghai Business Guild Comrades Association for the Recovery of Shanghai in the Xinhai Revolution held a 36th anniversary commemorative meeting at the Lake Society on Guizhou Road at 3:00 p.m. yesterday, and publicly paid tribute to the martyrs Chen Ying-shi, Liu Shun-qing, Zhang Pei-ru, Yu Zhi-wei, Rong Jiu-song, and Di Qi-feng, as well as the virtuous predecessors Li Ping-shu, Shen Xian-yun, Wang Yi-ting, Yu Ping-han, Lai Hui-jun, Shen Wen-bin, Su Jun-shang, Shang Shao-zeng, Zhang Gong-le, Ye Hong-ying, and the deceased comrades of the Business Guild. Wu Guo-zhen (represented by Wang Guan-qing), Pan Gong-zhan, Xuan Lu-wu, Chen Ba-shi, Wang Zhen-xiao, and guests from all walks of life attended, as well as family members of members, totaling more than 400 people. At its peak, the Business Guild had more than 6,800 members. The Xinhai revolutionary martyr Chen Ying-shi led the Business Guild to attack the Manufacturing Bureau, recovering the city. It has been 36 years since then. After 36 years of changes, the national revolutionary heroes of that year have almost all passed away, and only 241 members of the Business Guild Comrades Association are still alive today. At the beginning of the establishment of the Comrades Association last summer, there were 246 people, and 5 more have passed away in one year. Yesterday, a total of 152 people attended, most of whom were elderly. The oldest was Chairman Zhu Shao-yi, who is 76 years old, and the youngest were Ma Bo-shou and several others, who are also 53 years old.

Public Tribute at the Meeting

The meeting began with a tribute to the martyrs, virtuous predecessors, and deceased comrades of the Business Guild. After the tribute, Chairman Zhu Shao-yi reported, followed by speeches from the attending officials. Commander Xuan requested: Everyone here is an old comrade who attacked the Manufacturing Bureau, the creator of the most glorious page in revolutionary history. Today, after the victory of the War of Resistance, we are waiting to work hard to build the country, but there are conspirators who are trying to undermine the Republic of China, which is very distressing. Future construction still requires continued efforts. Speaker Pan then delivered a speech, roughly saying: The Shanghai Business Guild Comrades for the Recovery of Shanghai are holding a commemorative meeting in the Chen Ying-shi Martyr Memorial Hall today, which is of profound significance. Your glorious achievements in revolutionary history will be passed down to all ages and will last forever. From the Xinhai Revolution to the birth of the Republic of China, the Republic of China has always grown up in hardship and difficulty. Although the War of Resistance has been won, internal and external troubles are frequent. Lüshun and Dalian have not yet been recovered, and sovereignty is not yet complete. Recalling the hard work of the martyrs in creating the Republic of China, we should be even more vigilant. I hope that the citizens of Shanghai will maintain the traditional revolutionary spirit and work hard to build the country. Committee Member Chen Ai-shi, the younger brother of the martyr Chen Ying-shi, then rose to report the process of the recovery of Shanghai in the Xinhai Revolution, and narrated the importance of the position occupied by the recovery of Shanghai in the revolutionary process. Wang Xiao-lai, the former president of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, then spoke about the evolution of the city's Business Guild and the details of its evolution into today's voluntary police force.

Three Suggestions

At the same time, taking advantage of yesterday's meeting, the Xinhai Revolutionary Comrades Association made three suggestions to the city's party and government authorities and the Municipal Council: (1) Incorporate the fact that Shanghai was recovered in the Xinhai Revolution into the local chronicles. (2) The recovery of Shanghai was on September 13th of the lunar calendar, which is November 3rd of the solar calendar. Please designate this day as a local memorial day in order to commemorate the achievements of Chen Gong Ying-shi in recovering Shanghai, as well as the martyrs who died in this campaign, and the local gentry who assisted in this campaign, so that the people of the city will never forget. (3) The Shanghai Business Guild has more than three acres of land in Lujiabang in this city. It is willing to build a Shanghai Business Guild Memorial Monument and Memorial Hall on it, with an attached elementary school. After a few years, after all the Business Guild comrades have passed away, there will still be relics left in this city, and the descendants of thousands of comrades will see the objects and think of people, and encourage their actions. After the meeting, there was a rehearsal of a Peking opera, with wonderful programs such as Qian Hua-fo's special addition of an official. After the play, there was a dinner, and the meeting did not break up until around 10:00 p.m.

### First Meeting of Directors and Supervisors of the National Products Manufacturers Association

### Actively Auditing Business Income Tax; Audit Standards Increased as Much as Possible; Only Three Percent of Shanghai Units Should Be Audited

In order to implement the principle of rectifying tax revenue under the Economic Emergency Measures Plan, the Ministry of Finance is actively auditing last year's business income tax and selectively conducting audits. However, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce believes that the procedures are cumbersome and has requested the Ministry of Finance to exempt account verification and continue to adopt simplified tax collection methods. A spokesman for the Ministry of Finance stated that, according to the regulations of the Business Income Tax Collection Measures, Shanghai City belongs to the account verification tax area, and the Shanghai Direct Tax Bureau is actively carrying out account verification work, which is being handled by order and in accordance with the principle of fair calculation.

Recently, in consideration of the convenience of business people in practice, the audit standards have been increased as much as possible. Except for those in each industry whose declared total annual turnover is more than 400 million yuan, or whose profit is more than 200 million yuan, audits will still be conducted. The rest will be handled in accordance with the standard tax calculation method. The so-called standard tax calculation is based on the declared income, randomly inspecting the account records of each industry, and comparing 5% to 10% of the most complete and accurate merchants. In each industry, the amount of turnover is also considered, and a lottery method is used to select the numbers for inspection. Then, based on the results of the inspection, the standard ratio is calculated, and then the tax amount is assessed by household. According to this standard, among the more than 50,000 industrial and commercial enterprises in Shanghai, those that should be audited, calculated based on sales, account for about 1,600 units. The financial industry, which reports its income, has more than 40 units. In total, the number of units that should be audited accounts for just under 3% of the entire city of Shanghai, including many foreign companies. By doing so, both fairness and convenience can be taken into account. The Ministry has already instructed the Shanghai Direct Tax Bureau to follow and comply with it carefully, and strictly prevent harassment, so that both national interests and the welfare of the people can be taken into account. The spokesman also stated that the simplified tax collection method that was once piloted in the past involved trade associations determining the amount and apportioning it among the same trade, which was actually equivalent to apportionment and was not in line with the basic system of income tax, so it should not be adopted. In the future, the Ministry of Finance will continue to devote itself to the establishment of a good and reasonable tax system, and hopes that the business people across the country will cooperate sincerely and jointly witness its success. In addition, foreign companies in Shanghai, such as Mobil Oil, have not only declared their income for the previous year and paid income tax, but have also recently estimated their profits for January to April this year and prepaid a large amount of income tax.

For DDT spraying, the total amount of pure powder allocated by the head office is about 12 tons, and the content of 10% is about 30 tons, but because of the difficulty in purchasing kerosene, there is not much powder in stock, so the spraying and disinfection work is divided into three categories: (1) Shanty towns, slums, public toilets, etc. are sprayed free of charge by the Epidemic Prevention Committee. (2) If institutions, schools, and groups need to try spraying, the Epidemic Prevention Committee can provide DDT powder free of charge and provide assistance and guidance, but kerosene must be self-provided, and each gallon can spray 1,000 square feet. (3) If hotels, restaurants, large factories, etc. need to be sprayed, they can contact the Epidemic Prevention Committee and recover the cost.

### Cracking Down on Taxi Drivers' Small Account; Drivers Propose Two Demands

Since the police bureau announced the crackdown on small accounts, most customers have refused to pay, and taxi drivers and workers mainly rely on alcohol income to maintain their lives, in addition to a few fixed extra wages, so everyone suddenly became panicked. The union of the industry had asked the police bureau for remedies a few days ago. As a result, Director Ruan instructed in person that before the wages of taxi drivers are adjusted, they should still be handled according to old habits, and instructed all drivers to serve with peace of mind. After discussion by all drivers, the association proposed two demands: (1) Deduct 20% of each trip's fare as a mutual assistance fund. (2) Add another 10% as a welfare fund. It has formally submitted the demands to the employer's trade association. According to the person in charge of the association, taxi drivers and workers are currently often imprisoned due to traffic congestion and accidents, and their families' lives cannot be maintained. Therefore, they requested that the employer extract 10% from the industry's income as a welfare fund.

### Difficult to Sell Traitor Houses: Hard to Move People During Housing Shortage; Liquidation Office to Request Instructions

The Enemy and Puppet Property Liquidation Office has received and seized many enemy and puppet properties. A portion of these, the assets of traitors, have not yet been put up for sale. According to a person in charge of the Liquidation Office, there are many difficulties in selling the real estate of traitors. Most of the major traitors in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces have been sentenced, and all valuable real estate belongs to these major traitors. Moreover, there are many properties. However, all are being managed and occupied by government officials or local prominent gentry. During this time of housing shortages, it is impossible to move them, which makes it impossible for the Liquidation Office to assess the value and conduct public auctions. Recently, high-ranking officials and gentry have expressed their willingness to purchase the houses they are managing and occupying with priority, and are unwilling for the Liquidation Office to conduct public auctions. Under these circumstances, the Liquidation Office is considering whether they can pay the full amount without delay. In short, the Liquidation Office is doing its best to overcome difficulties in handling these traitor houses. If the matter is delayed for too long, they will have to request instructions from the authorities to make firm regulations.

### Number of Professional Criminals Exceeds Two Hundred; Thieves Account for Half; Mostly Lazy by Nature; District Court Imposes Forced Labor

Those criminals who were released under the amnesty and commit crimes again are sentenced as recidivists under criminal law, or are known as habitual offenders (those who make a living by committing crimes). According to statistics from the District Court, there are more than 200 habitual offenders in this city, of which theft accounts for more than 50%. Chief Prosecutor Huang Liang of the District Prosecutor's Office told reporters: Most habitual offenders are lazy or wandering by nature and unwilling to work. The District Court handles these types of criminals with modern criminal policies that focus on security measures such as forced labor.

The required cement, steel bars, and other materials have also been mostly prepared. However, due to soaring prices and the enlargement of the bridge surface, the original budget of more than 800 million yuan is far from sufficient and a supplementary budget is needed to complete the project.

### Dr. Qian Jianqiu Broadcasts: Shanghai Women's Movement After Victory Should Cultivate Strong Will and Exert Strength

[Our Newspaper] This newspaper held its eleventh Sunday special broadcast yesterday at the Minsheng Radio Station, inviting Dr. Qian Jianqiu (see photo, taken by this newspaper) to broadcast, entitled "The Shanghai Women's Movement After Victory." The following is a record of her speech:

Unite and Seek Common Welfare

"The history of the women's movement is very long and the scope is very wide. Today's scope is limited to one year and ten months after the victory, and the materials are limited to the Shanghai urban area. The meaning of the term women's movement is that the majority of women unite and work together to seek the welfare of women themselves. To promote the women's movement, the first thing is to have a strict organization to generate power. Women from all walks of life in Shanghai can be divided into (1) professional women, (2) housewives, (3) working women, and (4) female youths in school. After the victory, we collectively organized the women of Shanghai and established eleven friendship associations, such as those in the education sector, the art sector, the sports sector, housewives, and college and middle school students in school. Each unit seeks common interests. As for welfare, the Shanghai Women's Welfare Association was also established to handle relief, childcare, and other welfare matters. The work of the above organizations is promoted under the guidance of the Shanghai Women's Movement Committee. This is an outline of the women's movement. Below, I want to report some actual situations:

College and Middle School Girls Focus on Training

(1) College and Middle School Girls - College and middle school girls are all intellectuals. They need to have complete training in terms of thought and character. We have held speeches, essays, and sports competitions one after another. In one year and ten months, we have tried our best. Because speeches can train speaking skills, essays can improve writing skills, and sports can temper their physique, so we attach great importance to these three competitions.

Professional Women Still Need to Work Hard

(2) Professional Women - There are quite a number of professional women in Shanghai. The largest number are in the education sector, followed by freelancers, and those in politics and business. Among freelancers, doctors are the most numerous, followed by lawyers, and accountants are fewer. As for women in politics, I feel that they are just empty names, and there are too few who can take on actual responsibilities. Taking Shanghai as an example, those above the recommended rank are as rare as phoenix feathers. Now, in name, men and women have equal rights, but it is difficult to develop freely in politics. As for those who serve in the business world, there are also very few who can stand out. Shanghai is the business center of the country, and if women cannot show their faces in the business world, other places can be imagined. There is also a gratifying phenomenon that female reporters are quite active after the victory, and their service efficiency is no less than that of men, but the number is still limited. I hope that my female comrades will work hard to expand the effectiveness of their services in various aspects of the professional world and win glory for the female world.

Housewives Have No Lack of Talent

(3) Housewives - The largest number of women in Shanghai are still housewives. Some of them are only consumers and do not produce. Many of them have received advanced education and have very good talents, but they cannot develop their ambitions upward, which makes people feel very sorry. During the period of the fall, everyone felt that the environment was special, and even after the victory, the thoughts of the general housewives have greatly improved, thinking that in the process of national construction, they can no longer live in a drunken dream and want to do some undertakings that are beneficial to the country and society. For example, when their children grow up, they can contribute part of their time and energy to social undertakings. This is a kind of alertness and a good phenomenon of self-reliance. At the same time, they are very concerned about childcare and relief, such as donations to nurseries, and they are worthy of everyone's admiration.

Improve the Lives of Working Women

(4) Working Women - Speaking of working women, there are quite a few in Shanghai. They have made great efforts for social production, but their lives are difficult. We express our great sympathy and should promote their welfare undertakings as much as possible. In other words, since they are the producers of society, we will promote their welfare undertakings even more so that they can get comfort in spirit and enjoy in material. In the past, we ran literacy classes to give them the opportunity to receive education and ran nurseries to give their children reasonable care.

General Women Should Correct Bad Habits

(5) General Women - There are also general women in Shanghai who live extravagantly, admire vanity, and their actions are not in line with the right path. We regret this and should take the responsibility to correct them. First, extravagant living should be reformed; second, the mentality of vanity should be changed; third, we must establish a foundation for economic independence so that they can develop a simple, hardworking, and hardy spirit. We want to launch a women's movement. We should make women develop a strong will, not follow the crowd, and not be assimilated by the inferior environment. Exert the power of the women's world to launch a bright future for the women's movement."

Full-Day Broadcast Program

Yesterday was the eleventh special broadcast organized by this newspaper. It started at 9:00 AM with Reverend Zhao Junying speaking on "Science and Religion," Dr. Zhong Zhihe speaking on "Conclusion of Artificial Pneumothorax," and Liu Dayin speaking on "A Brief Discussion on US Dollar Bonds."

The participating schools included the 1st and 2nd Centers, Xicheng, and Tonghui units of the 5th District, sponsored and led by Xu Xiyi, Pan Boying, and Jin Shirong, and personally conducted by Xu and Pan. The performances were very beautiful.

### Bird's-Eye View of the Domestic Film Industry: There are a Total of Five Large-Scale Production Companies in Shanghai; the Existence of War Zones Limits Many Screening Opportunities

[Special Feature of This Newspaper] Watching movies is the favorite entertainment of most citizens. In this city, which is overwhelmingly occupied by Hollywood movies, let us take a bird's-eye view of the situation of the domestic film industry, which is shrinking in a corner.

First of all, let's talk about the production companies. In the whole of Shanghai—or even the whole of China—there are (1) Central Film Studio, (2) Cathay Film Company, (3) Former Lianhua Film Company's old department, (4) Shanghai Experimental Film Factory, and (5) Wenhua Film Company, etc. There are five companies with a larger scale, a fixed organization, and a foundation. China Electric is a semi-official institution. Luo Xuelian is the head of the factory, and it is divided into three factories below. The first factory is in Tientong'an, Zhabei, and the head of the factory is Qiu Yiwei. The second factory is on Jianguo West Road, and the head of the factory is Su Yi. The third factory is far away in Beiping, and the head of the factory is Xu Angqian. Cathay is a purely commercial film company. The old cabinet is Liu Zhonghao. It has strong capital and a large number of people. It produces the most and the fastest, but it inevitably becomes bad. The base of production is in Damuqiao. The organization of the old department of Lianhua is more complicated. Its names include Shanghai Film Studio and Kunlun Film Company. Like Shanghai Experimental Film Factory, it is hosted by more serious artists. The person in charge of the former is Cai Chusheng, Zheng Junli, Kuang Dongshan, etc., and the latter is Fei Mu. Wenhua is smaller in planning, and the manager is Wu Xingcai. The production locations of the above three companies are concentrated in the Xujiahui Triangle. In addition, there may be a few friends who "stir up" in the film circle, suddenly rising, or blessed to the heart. Thinking that there is money to be made, they gather a group of capital, invite a few "popular" stars, borrow other people's studios, or even go as far as Hong Kong to shoot one or two movies, and put on a name of a certain production company for release. This type of "guerrilla-style" producer has no fixed organization and no fixed foundation, so there is no need to talk about it here.

Star Remuneration: Female is Valued More than Male

According to estimates by friends in the circle, Cathay's production speed in the past was an average of one movie per month, but now there is a trend of slowing down. China Electric and Wenhua average one movie every two months, while the old department of Lianhua and the Experimental Factory only have one movie a year. The speed of production depends not only on the size of capital and scale, but also on whether the attitude of production is to be group abuse or serious.

The most important thing in the production of a movie is the director and the actors. Since the victory, Shanghai society has been invisibly divided into two domains: "those from the mainland" and "those from the recovered area." The film industry is no exception. "Directors and actors from the mainland" are mostly concentrated in China Electric, such as Zhang Junxiang, Chen Liting, Zhao Dan, Bai Yang, Qin Yi, etc., "those in the recovered area" are included by Cathay, etc., such as Yang Xiaozhong, Xu Xinfu, Li Pingqian, Chen Yanyan, Liu Qiong, Gu Lanjun, Li Lihua, Yan Jun, etc. There is another group that has transferred from the drama world, such as Zuo Lin, Shi Hui, Zhang Fa, etc. However, as far as actors are concerned, most of them are not fixedly attached to a certain company or a certain film studio, but are the so-called "star special appointment system." Their remuneration is calculated by film value. The current salary for each film ranges from 10 million to 40 million yuan, depending on the "degree of popularity," and there is a difference between men and women. Female stars always earn more than male stars.

The Cost of a Movie is 500 Million

In the social and economic environment where prices continue to rise, the situation of the film industry is similar to that of the general industrial sector. It is estimated that the production cost of each movie now is about 500 million yuan in national currency. From the completion of production to the revenue from screening, it seems to make money on the surface, but when calculated at the cost of reproduction, making money becomes a loss. For this reason, some manufacturers seek speed in making films in order to make the flow of funds faster, but this inevitably leads to criticism of group production and abuse. In addition, the existence of war zones limits the opportunity for films to be screened in many places, which is also a major blow to the income of producers.

The Most Successful Film

In terms of equipment and technology, domestic films are of course far behind Hollywood films, but the most regrettable thing is the lack of film and drama themes. Someone said: If movies are compared to people, the script is like bones, the director is like the soul, and the actors are like flesh and blood. Without a good script, the director cannot perform, the actors cannot perform, and what the domestic film industry lacks most is good screenwriters. Secondly, there are too few good actors. Under the star system, an actor often makes films for more than two manufacturers at the same time, which is a loss of time and energy. As for directorial talent, there is no shortage, and there are several first-class players among them. If they can be given a good script, equipment, and talent, it is possible to create brilliant achievements.

Finally, it is worth mentioning that the most successful domestic film since the victory, which means the film with the most audiences, is "Top Secret Number One," produced by the Third Factory of China Electric, directed by Tu Guangqi, and starring Ouyang Shafei. It is said that this film is not only selling well in first-run theaters, but also in second- and third-run theaters for a long time.

If Cooperating with Excellent Script Equipment, It May Not Be Possible to Create Brilliant Achievements

### Funding Adjusted for All Colleges and Universities: To Be Distributed on Schedule Starting in July; the Amounts for May and June Have Been Ordered by the National Treasury to Be Issued by Central Banks in Various Places

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 15th] Since the government adjusted the salaries of public school employees, the adjusted additional funding for all national colleges and universities should be allocated starting in May. The Beijing and Shanghai areas are close to the capital and have been issued separately according to the additional amounts. Due to the remote locations of various places, the official documents were forwarded and the payment orders arrived late, which affected the faculty and staff of the colleges and universities and they could not receive the additional salaries for May on time. A few days ago, the colleges and universities in Beiping held a meeting on this matter and decided to telegraph the relevant authorities to allocate the additional funding for May as soon as possible. It is heard that the Ministry of Education has long paid attention to this and submitted a request to the Executive Yuan in mid-May to notify the National Treasury of the Ministry of Finance of the payment order for the funds added to the adjustment of various colleges and universities in May as soon as possible, and to order the National Treasury Bureau of the Central Bank to separately notify the National Treasury of the branch offices in various places to issue the funds as soon as possible, and also to send a letter to the National Treasury of the Ministry of Finance to grant prompt handling. Recently, the National Treasury has replied to the Ministry of Education, generally stating that the adjusted additional amounts for May and June have been transferred to the National Treasury Bureau together, and the National Treasury of the Central Bank has been notified separately to issue them in various places, and the additional funding from July to December is also planned to be sent to the National Treasury in various places so that they can be paid on schedule. It is learned that the additional funding for May for various colleges and universities can be received from the local National Treasury, and the funding for June can also be withdrawn on time. From July onwards, the National Treasury can issue the funds on schedule.

[Report from this newspaper in this city] Alumni associations of National Peiping University of Technology in various places have written to request the restoration of the school and oppose its merger into Peiyang University. They have successively sent representatives to Shanghai to gather and discuss petitioning the Ministry of Education in Nanjing. The Shanghai branch of the Alumni Association hosted reporters from this city at the YMCA at 6 PM yesterday, where they reported on the matter. According to the association's chairman, Hu Juewen, the school was founded in the 29th year of the Guangxu reign of the Qing Dynasty as the Imperial Higher Industrial School, under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce. In the first year of the Republic of China, it was renamed the Beijing Industrial Vocational School, under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Education. In the thirteenth year, it was renamed National Beijing University of Technology. In the seventeenth year, the Ministry of Education implemented the university district system, merging various national colleges and universities in Peiping into Peiping University, and the school was renamed the First Engineering College of Peiping University. In the nineteenth year, it was renamed the Engineering College of Peiping University. When the War of Resistance broke out in the twenty-sixth year, faculty and students moved west, becoming part of the Northwest United University and the Northwest Institute of Technology. After the victory, various schools were restored one after another, but the Ministry of Education alone proposed the merger of Peiping University of Technology into Peiyang University of Technology. The students of the school felt dissatisfied and decided to take the following steps: (1) National Peiping University of Technology or National Peiping Institute of Technology has its reasons for existing, and its restoration must be vowed. A document will be prepared and first requested from the Ministry of Education. (2) Send representatives to personally meet with Minister Zhu to request restoration starting from the next semester and to first issue an order to prevent Peiyang from merging the alma mater. (3) If the second request is not approved by the Ministry of Education, it will be made public to the society and appealed to the relevant authorities. (4) If, during the pre-litigation process, the Ministry of Education still obstructs the restoration of the alma mater based on the deceptive reasons for the representative of the industrial school approved last year, they will go to Beijing to petition according to the original plan and will not stop until the goal of restoring the school is achieved. At the same time, a school restoration committee will be organized. Self-restoration of classes will be conducted at the original site of the alma mater. Subsequently, Dai Ruji, an old professor of the school (now a professor at Jiaotong University), listed eighteen reasons why the University of Technology should not be abolished, explaining the achievements and characteristics of the school's contribution to national industrial construction since its establishment, which is famous at home and abroad, hoping that the education authorities will carefully consider it.

### Former Assets of Peiyang May Be Taken Over by Peking University

[Beiping, This Newspaper, 15th] Jin Wenshu, the president of Peiyang, received a letter from Mao Yisheng a few days ago, stating that the Ministry of Education has made a decision on the issue of the former assets of Peiyang, namely, to be taken over by Peking University or to establish an independent institute of technology. If the latter is adopted, the campus will have to be moved to Baoding in the future. After Jin Wenshu's negotiations in recent days, it is more likely that Peking University will take over. Hu Shi stated that although many science and engineering professors at Peking University oppose it, if opinions are consistent and the Ministry of Education issues a clear order, he can make it happen. Jin will send two letters to Nanjing, expressing that it is more appropriate for Peking University to take over.

Despite the rain and wind, there were still more than 200 spectators, and the atmosphere was not lonely at all. Youyi came to the court with great momentum. In the first two rounds, Zhu Jinhai and Zhu Qingji of Youyi were against Lu Wenliang and Deng Xiurong, the main players of Hualian. Lu and Deng had fierce shots, but the two Zhus resisted desperately and achieved miraculous results. Lu and Deng were temporarily caught in a hard fight. They finally reversed the situation and created a victory with their rich experience and calm attitude. It was a pity that Youyi could win but did not. Hualian's morale was even higher. Li Zhen, Yang Zhixiong, and Li Zaichun all played with ease. Youyi was defeated repeatedly. It was not until Shen Airen ascended the court that he forcefully defeated Pan Rixi, the chopping-style player of Hualian, 3-2, to pull back a game. As a result, Hualian defeated Youyi 6-1 and ranked first in the third division, while Youyi retreated to second place.

The finals between Jingwu and Hualian of the second division will be held at the Yokohama Bridge Central Auditorium at 8 PM tonight, with Chen Linsheng and Li Longbiao as referees. Jingwu was the overall third runner-up in the previous season. This season, they have the help of Wang Youxin, Ouyang Wei, Yang Kaiyun, and others. The strength of the lineup is no less than that of Huxing. Hualianhua is a military force composed of new and old table tennis players. In the second division, they have repeatedly defeated strong enemies and maintained their undefeated streak. With players such as Zhou Weixin, Ye Xuebin, and Gu Jinxiang, who are all veterans of more than ten years ago, and Liu Baotai and Xu Zhifu, who are excellent talents among the newcomers, they pose a serious threat to Jingwu.

### After Zou Bingwen Agreed to Serve as Chairman, the Textile Adjustment Committee Began Preparations; Wu Weijing Still Resigned from Concurrent Position as Director

[Our Report] The Ministry of Economic Affairs' Textile Industry Adjustment Committee, since its approval for establishment, has not commenced preparatory work due to internal personnel matters still being arranged. It is now learned that Zou Bingwen's appointment as chairman is largely settled. Therefore, the committee's preparatory work will begin immediately, with plans to find a suitable address and recruit staff. It is expected that the official establishment will be announced within this week once arrangements are finalized. It is reported that after its establishment, the committee will take over the business of the Textile Management Committee in handling the transportation of yarn and cloth between North and South China and re-export operations. However, the committee will consider the current situation and revise various regulations on the export of yarn and cloth to meet actual needs.

Additionally, Wu Weijing was originally announced to concurrently hold the position of Director of the Business Department of the committee. However, Wu stated that his original position as Deputy General Manager of China Textile Construction Corporation was already busy, and it would be especially inconvenient for a member of China Textile Construction to hold such an impartial position. Therefore, he personally visited Zou Bingwen's residence yesterday to firmly tender his resignation. It is said that Zou still persuaded Wu to withdraw his resignation and work diligently together to advance the committee's work.

### 1946 Business Overview of the Bank of China

[Our Report] The Bank of China held its 23rd Annual General Meeting of Shareholders on the 14th. Details of the meeting were reported in yesterday's newspaper. Further details on the Bank's business overview for 1946 are as follows:

1. Deposits

At the end of the year, the total amount of various deposits in domestic and overseas branches was over 435.5 billion yuan, an increase of over 384.3 billion yuan compared to the previous year. Domestic deposits accounted for approximately 54%, while overseas deposits accounted for approximately 46%. Among domestic depositors, industrial and mining enterprises accounted for 41%, government agencies accounted for 35%, individuals accounted for only 11%, and groups and businesses accounted for 13% collectively.

2. Loans

At the end of the year, the outstanding loan balance was over 278.7 billion yuan, an increase of over 263.5 billion yuan compared to the previous year. International trade loans accounted for the largest share, approximately 43%, followed by industrial and mining enterprises at 29%, transportation and sales enterprises at 18%, and the remaining 10% allocated to transportation, public utilities, and other businesses. The government-assigned loan program for overseas Chinese to resume their businesses is still progressing gradually due to local legal restrictions. The guarantees issued by the bank under government orders are: (1) US$16 million for Yongli Chemical Company's equipment procurement loan, and (2) US$33 million for the US cotton loan.

3. Remittances

A. Domestic Remittances: The total amount of domestic remittances this year was over 19,129 billion yuan, an increase of 17,362 billion yuan compared to the previous year, with commercial and industrial remittances being the most prevalent.

B. Foreign Exchange: At the end of 1945, the International Department moved to Shanghai with the head office, and foreign exchange business also began to develop. On March 4th of this year, the foreign exchange market opened and exchange rates were adjusted. For export businesses, the bank simplified foreign exchange settlement procedures and provided loans through packing and export document financing to promote the export of domestic products. For imports of foreign goods, foreign exchange was only provided for essential goods. Less essential goods had to be curtailed to conserve resources. Over the past year, the International Department received a total of approximately US$33 million in export foreign exchange and paid approximately US$80 million in import foreign exchange. These import and export foreign exchange figures are not ideal, but they cannot be changed by the bank alone. The International Department and its branches collected and paid a total of US$120 million in import and export foreign exchange, accounting for a considerable portion of the country's total foreign trade value.

Overseas Chinese remittances were handled according to the method of adding subsidies before the exchange rate adjustment in January and February, and the business was brisk. Since March 4th, the subsidy method has been abolished, and all overseas remittances have been converted and paid according to the Bank of China's posted exchange rates. Subsequently, the black market exchange rate gradually increased, and the amount received by the bank decreased day by day. By the end of the year, a total of over 61 billion national currency was received, approximately 60 billion yuan more than the previous year.

4. Investments

In the past, the bank's goal for investing in various businesses was to promote production in the rear and enhance the strength of the War of Resistance. Since the post-war recovery, construction has yet to begin, and the need for investment has become even more urgent. During the year, the number of projects approved by the Joint Treasury Administration for the bank to participate in continued to increase, and the targets were mostly production and distribution organizations.

5. Branch Network Dynamics

The number of branches in various locations has been increased or decreased as needed. By the end of the year, there were a total of 222 branches, 205 in China and 17 abroad. Among them, 58 branches in China, including Qingdao, Zhengzhou, and Changchun, have resumed operations. Five branches abroad, including Yangon and Haiphong, have resumed operations. Sixteen branches in China, including Tanggu and Fushun, have been newly established. One branch in Saigon has been newly established abroad. Twenty-six branches in China, including Lingling and Dushan, have been closed. One branch in Hanoi has been closed abroad.

### The Tobacco Market is Apparently Firm but Actually Soft

The situation in the cigarette market yesterday opened strongly in the morning. The market for "Men Fei" and other brands was still good, and prices gradually increased. Ten-pack Great Britain cigarettes were once pushed up to 6.3 million yuan. As the market rose, selling increased frequently, transactions gradually cleared, and prices fell by 110,000 to 120,000 yuan. In the afternoon, there was some sporadic interest, so the price of ten-pack Great Britain cigarettes returned to 6.22 million yuan, an increase of 70,000 yuan compared to the previous day. Old Knife cigarettes and the Five Flowers Hardamen brand also rose by 50,000 to 100,000 yuan. Throughout the day, the situation in the cigarette market was that due to the upcoming "Plum Rain" season (starting on the 16th) and continuous deliveries from manufacturers, dealers were nervous about the upcoming Dragon Boat Festival and tight credit conditions. Holders rushed to sell at high prices, so it was difficult for prices to stabilize. Only the Old Knife brand was actively traded, with prices being pushed up to 5.26 million yuan for成交. Although it was a weekday, the Golden Dragon brand cigarettes from Huacheng Company were also particularly popular. Prices rose to 18,200 yuan, making them difficult to buy. Finally, there was a transaction at 18,500 yuan, an increase of 700 yuan from the previous day. Other Huacheng brands were also good.

Canned cigarettes saw a return to prices between 1,500 and 2,600 yuan due to more active sales. They also remained stable due to less spoilage during the rainy season. However, there were many shipments from Hong Kong recently, which were being sold on the market. Dealers were already satisfied, and there was very little inter-dealer trading, so it was also difficult for prices to stabilize.

### Interest Rate Survey

[Our Report] According to the interest rate survey of major cities across the country in the past week released by the Inspection Department of the Central Bank, the highest rate for interbank lending was in Ningbo, at 6 yuan per thousand. Next were Hangzhou, Jinan, and Zhenjiang, all at 5.5 yuan. Shanghai, Tianjin, and Beiping were all at 5 yuan. Chongqing, Hankou, Yangzhou, Wenzhou, Huaiyang, and Shijiazhuang were all at 4.5 yuan. The lowest was Jinzhou, at only 1.2 yuan.

The highest rate for interbank daily lending was in Jinan, at 4.5 yuan per thousand. Next were Hangzhou, Tianjin, and Yangzhou, all at 3.5 yuan. Shanghai, Nanjing, Xi'an, Beiping, Baoji, Taiyuan, Wenzhou, Santai, Leshan, Ningbo, and Zhenjiang were all at 3 yuan. The lowest were Jinzhou, Chengde, Changchun, Shangrao, Quxian, Pingliang, and Xining, all at 0.5 yuan.

### Deng Huamin Returns to Shanghai from Beijing and Resigns as General Manager of the Sichuan Provincial Bank

Deng Huamin, Chairman of the Board of Directors of Tunghui Industrial Bank, recently went to Beijing from Chongqing to attend the National Political Council. After the meeting, he discussed the difficulties of Sichuan with relevant parties in Beijing. It is now learned that Deng Huamin has completed his business and arrived in Shanghai yesterday. The reporter visited him and asked if he was willing to take the position of General Manager of the Sichuan Provincial Bank. Deng replied that the rumors were absolutely untrue. He continued to say that prices in Sichuan have been rising sharply in the past month, especially for rice. This is because of purchases from Beijing, Shanghai, and Hankou, with large quantities being transported eastward, and because of rising prices at the source, leading to increased costs. Those holding stocks were unwilling to sell, and there was a shortage of supply in the market, so the price of grain has risen to as high as 170,000 to 180,000 yuan per stone. Cotton yarn, on the other hand, has seen a reverse flow. As for the market, there is an extreme shortage of cash, so even for ordinary commercial needs, it is difficult to obtain cash for millions or small payments. This situation deserves attention, he said.

### Difficulties in Exporting Frozen Eggs to the UK Resolved; National Bank Plans Remedial Measures

The Loan and Grant Council's export of frozen eggs to the UK has been delayed due to disagreements on prices. There are still 4,500 tons undelivered. The UK price is 480 yuan per ton, while the cost of Chinese frozen eggs is approximately 600 yuan per ton in US dollars. After repeated consultations, the Business Bureau of the Central Bank has proposed remedial measures to facilitate exports. The UK still intends to order from China for two reasons: (1) Imports from China can be done through barter trade, saving the country's foreign exchange. (2) China's pre-war exports of frozen eggs to the UK accounted for 90% of that commodity's exports. Therefore, in order to maintain future trade, they are willing to increase the purchase price appropriately. It is expected that delivery can be completed by the end of September.

### Cotton Continues to Arrive

The cotton market situation is that prices are weak due to continuous arrivals and falling external cotton prices. Customers are very willing to sell, and yarn mills are not very interested in buying. Credit conditions on the market have eased, and the market is still weak. Trading volume for various grades was slightly lower than the previous day, and transactions were not strong. In the afternoon, 75 pieces of Dangbao cotton were traded at a price of 1.5 million yuan. 100 pieces of Shashi Daguan were traded at a price of 1.46 million yuan. The above were all spot prices for delivery at the warehouse. In addition, 111 pieces of Shashi cotton were traded at a price of 1.435 million yuan, for delivery at the warehouse, with payment by check in seven days. 100 pieces of Hankou wood frame cotton were traded at a price of 1.16 million yuan, delivered to the factory, with payment by check in ten days.

### Timber Arrivals are Congested

The timber market is very tight on credit, and recent increases in carpenter wages have affected sales. The entire market fell yesterday, and very little trading occurred. Hangzhou timber has fallen by one-third since the beginning of the month, from 850,000 yuan per tael to 500,000 yuan, with no buyers. Foreign pine has fallen to 6,500 yuan per foot. Five-tenths pine planks have fallen from 150,000 yuan per zhang to 120,000 yuan. Large cedar logs are 2,200 yuan per foot, and small logs are 2,100 yuan, a decrease of 1,000 yuan from the peak. There has been plenty of rainfall in various places recently, and timber has been flowing downstream, so arrivals are congested.

### Tobacco Leaf Loan Allocations for Various Provinces Determined, Totaling Over 27.9 Billion

The tobacco leaf loan for various provinces this year has been approved by the Joint Treasury Administration to be 27,935 million yuan. The China Farmers Bank has also proposed a breakdown of the loan allocations (in millions of yuan) as follows: Sichuan Province: tobacco leaf production 300, processing 260; Guizhou Province: tobacco leaf production 300, processing 260; Anhui Province: tobacco leaf production 2400, processing 1845; Henan Province: tobacco leaf production 11200, processing 9610; Northeast Province: tobacco leaf production 600, processing 460.

### Business Conditions in the First Half of the Year are Generally Good

The end of June is approaching, and all industries are preparing for their first-half settlements. Although credit conditions in Shanghai are tight, both the four major banks and the two bureaus, as well as the joint reserve pool of the banking and money industries, have released large amounts of funds, allowing businesses to turn over their capital. Therefore, the difficult month-end should be passed smoothly. It is heard that all industries have been profitable in the first half of this year, especially the yarn and cloth industry, raw material, enamel, and tobacco industries, whose conditions are very good. Although department stores and pharmaceuticals have profited significantly from rising prices, it has been difficult for them to sustain operations due to large expenses. The silver shops, gold shops, and money exchange industries have fallen into a stalemate due to government crackdowns on speculation.

### China Trust Greatly Purchases Rapeseed in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui

Rapeseed has come onto the market in producing regions, and it is currently in its waning phase. In order to increase the production of edible oil, the China Trust Bureau has already prepared a purchasing plan, entrusting the Third District Vegetable Oil Refining Association to cooperate in the handling of the task. Cadres have been sent to important producing areas in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui to purchase in large quantities. The designated personnel were dispatched a week ago and are actively working. The needed麻袋 (hessian sacks/burlap bags) were shipped out by the bureau the other day, with 50 bundles or 20,000 sacks to Wuhu; and 30 bundles, or 12,000 sacks to the Pinghu-Suzhou area. Once the new goods arrive, they will be rationally allocated according to the existing equipment and production capacity of each factory, in accordance with the established policy. It is understood that China Trust can obtain one-third of the total amount, with the remainder belonging to eight companies including Dayouyu, Dadexin, Dachang, Shunyu, Huimin, and Tongsheng. According to the current price of new goods arriving in Shanghai, the market price is about 160,000 to 180,000 yuan per 100 kilograms. Due to local custom, Wuhu weighs 138 to 140 kilograms per bushel, while Pinghu-Suzhou weighs 126 to 128 kilograms per bushel. The average selling price is about 210,000 yuan per bushel. Shipping costs from Wuhu have increased by 70% due to adjustments in ship prices. Pinghu and Suzhou, on the other hand, can be transported by帆船 (sailing junks).

### Increased Costs and Inconvenient Transportation Greatly Reduce Sales of Sichuan Summer Cloth

[Central News Agency, Chengdu, 15th] Sichuan's specialty, summer cloth, is best produced in Rongchang and Longchang. The white ramie from Rongchang, Longchang, and Neijiang has light and soft fibers, with a pure white and beautiful color, and is the sole raw material for fine summer cloth. Therefore, these counties are the center of summer cloth production. The cloth-making process is roughly divided into three steps: first, spinning the ramie, weaving the fibers into ramie thread; second, weaving the cloth, spinning the ramie thread into raw cloth; and third, refining, bleaching, dyeing, printing, and sizing the raw cloth. Longchang and Neijiang are skilled in weaving and produce a lot of cloth. Neijiang's quality is the best, and most of the weaving is double-stranded. Rongchang is skilled in refining, as the water quality there is particularly good, and the bleached cloth is pure white and beautiful. Therefore, most of the bleaching, dyeing, printing, and sizing workshops are located there. Summer cloth is divided into plain cloth and羅紋 (ribbed) cloth, depending on the difference in the way the warp and weft threads are woven. Plain cloth is divided into clothing, bedding, and bag cloth, depending on its use. Each roll is about five zhang long and one foot four inches wide. The quality depends on the number of頭分 (threads) per roll. 頭分 refers to the number of warp and weft threads in the entire roll. Cloth with fewer than 500 頭分 is called coarse cloth. Cloth with 500 to 1,000 is middle-grade cloth. Cloth with more than 1,000 is fine cloth. The best can reach 1,600 頭分. Sichuan summer cloth is sold throughout the country and to Korea, Hong Kong, and other places. There are Beijing, Shandong, Shanxi, Henan, and Guangdong帮 (guilds). At the peak of production, the annual output reached more than 600,000 rolls. However, due to the slow operation of household side-business small handicrafts, each person works only two or three hours a day, producing only one or two zhang of cloth. In addition, rising prices and inconvenient transportation in recent years have greatly reduced sales, leading to a decline in production. The average output is about 200,000 to 300,000 rolls, and the current price is 100,000 yuan per roll.

### The Source of Industrial Oils and Fats

— Zhang Boan

The oil and fat industry in China still uses outdated production methods. Most oils and fats are produced by small units in the producing areas, and their scattered production and unregulated transactions have not been improved to this day.

Many people despise "vegetable oil" and "animal fat" without knowing their great utilization value and their relationship with everyone. Nowadays, with the prosperity of science, any substance has amazing uses. For example, "glycerin" is extracted from the oil and fat industry, and its extensive uses can have a significant impact on national defense. Without "trinitroglycerin," it would be impossible to synthesize explosives for bullets. Although TNT or Dynamite is more widely used, nitroglycerin is always a major source of explosives; the essential cigarettes and cosmetics cannot do without glycerin, and the nutrients that the human body absorbs every day cannot do without "oil" or "fat," especially since many industries cannot do without oils and fats. Recognizing this point, the importance of industrial oils and fats is no less than that of mineral oils.

Industrial oils and fats contain many types, the most widely used of which are cypress oil, tallow, coconut oil, and tung oil. Of the other edible oils and fats, apart from a few that are still used as industrial oils and fats, the most prominent are the four mentioned above.

Cypress oil is extracted from cypress seeds produced by cypress trees. The most commonly traded in Shanghai is "Heben." Heben is the abbreviation of Jiaxing Bencheli. Ping oil is produced in Wuping, Zhejiang (on the border of Anhui and Zhejiang), and Lan oil is produced in Lanxi, Zhejiang. Also, "Mingjian," "Jianma," "Macheng," "Chaixue," and "Jingbai" are either goods from north of the continent or goods from Hunan, mostly re-exported from Hankou. The peak season each year is December, and the production season is October. Most of it is used to make local wax candles, and soap factories can also use it to make soap, but its disadvantage is that it lacks luster and does not glow like coconut oil. Last summer, the price was 50,000 to 60,000 yuan per dan. This year, Heben's highest price was 850,000 yuan, more than ten times higher than last year. Recently, Sichuan梓汕 (Zishan) has been actively promoted in Shanghai.

The most popular tallow sold in Shanghai is蚌埠 (Bengbu) tallow. Tallow from Bengbu is the most sought after. There are also goods from Qingdao, etc. Sales are slightly lower in the summer each year, and the production season is from September to April. After April, there is no production. The daily output of Bengbu goods in this city is about 200 dan, and it is still necessary to supplement from other ports. At this time last year, each dan was 70,000 yuan, but now it has soared to 1.1 million yuan. Given that many producing areas have fallen into war zones, market inventory is very low, and further price increases are inevitable. All users must stockpile inventory to wait for the production season, so this period is the stockpiling period, after which production and sales will be weak.

The source of coconut oil is entirely imported. A lot was imported from Little Luzon last year, but now, as the goods have been imported for a long time, there are no further imports, and the inventory is extremely thin. Last spring, the price was 360,000 to 370,000 yuan per dan. In August and September, each dan only sold for 110,000 to 120,000 yuan. In February of this year, each dan reached a high of 850,000, and is currently at 1.2 million yuan. Coconut oil is most used by soap factories, and it is indispensable for soap factories. The current price from Hong Kong is 1.5 million yuan per dan, which is 300,000 yuan lower than the market price.

Tung oil is an export commodity, but the quantity used internally for paint is also very large, especially the usage for ships. The sales are very large every summer when ships are repaired. Recently, because the exchange rate is too low, exports are being withheld. The amount given is plentiful, and the price is also stable. The price last spring was 50,000 to 70,000 yuan per dan. The highest price this year reached 750,000 yuan. Now exports from Hong Kong must be 架匯 (priced based on the parallel exchange rate), so will the smuggling of tung oil to Hong Kong decrease slightly? Tung oil is the best of the drying oils. As the prospects for external sales are poor and internal sales are not attractive, tung farmers may lose interest in planting tung trees after a certain period. Recently, the China Trust Bureau has a barter agreement to transport 50,000 tons of tung oil to Japan, which is the largest export figure for Shanghai this year.

Other oils, such as lard and tea oil, are also exported, but in very small quantities. The refusal price of lard is 650,000 yuan per dan. The market price of tea oil is not known. Production in the inland is very abundant, but it is mostly used for eating. Soap factories also demand sheep oil.湯淮 (Tanghuai) (named because it is taken from oily water) is occasionally seen on the market, and the price is similar to that of sheep oil and lard. There is also egg yolk oil, and the price is not expensive, but there is very little. However, if this type of oil is refined for edible use, its nutritional value is very high.

### A Glimpse of Tanggu New Port (Part 1)

— Tianjin, 8th Day Aviation News, Xing Qishen

Tanggu is located on the north bank of the Hai River, facing Dagu. It is situated on the Bohai Bay, with the new port built here, located at 117 degrees 40 minutes east longitude and 39 degrees north latitude.

Tanggu closely connects Pingjin (Beijing and Tianjin). Its land transportation is connected to the main lines of the Beiping-Suiyuan, Jinpu, and Pinghan railways. Its water transportation extends upstream along the Hai River, reaching the upper reaches of the Bei Canal, Nan Canal, Dajizi River, and Ziya River, penetrating inland for no less than 3,000 kilometers. In terms of sea transport, it can directly connect with coastal ports and ports in Europe and America. Therefore, Tanggu New Port occupies a superior geographical position and is a necessary facility for international trade.

The distances between Tanggu New Port and major domestic and foreign seaports are as follows (unit: nautical miles):

Qingdao 425 Shanghai 678 Hong Kong 1400

Guangzhou 1491 Dalian 195 Simonoseki 770

Yokohama 1418 Vladivostok 294 Manila 1736

Honolulu 4677 San Francisco 5664 Panama 8788

Calcutta 4450 London 2035

Hydrology and Meteorology

1. Tides: According to the Hai River Engineering Bureau's report from the 31st year (1942), the average high tide level at the mouth of the Hai River from 1910 to 1942 was 0.258 meters above the Dagu zero point. August has the highest average of 3 meters. The average low tide level is 0.76 meters, and the average tidal range is 2.12 meters. The tidal current direction is northward during flood tide, with a speed of 2 nautical miles per hour. During high tide, the Gejiang sandbank outside Dagu Port is completely submerged. The tidal current meets the shore, resembling a parallel flood tide. During ebb tide, the flow is southward, with a speed of 1 nautical mile per hour. During neap tides, the time between slack water and the change of flow often lasts three to four hours.

2. Wind Force and Direction: According to records from 1929 to 1937, the wind force in Tanggu is strongest from the northwest, with an average maximum wind speed reaching 86.4 kilometers per hour. The most frequent wind direction is from the southeast, followed by the northwest and southwest. The influence of wind on the rise and fall of tides is very significant. When there are north and northwest winds, the high tide time is delayed and the tidal height is reduced. East and southeast winds increase the tidal height and delay the ebb tide time.

3. Temperature: According to the Central Meteorological Bureau's records from 1928 to 1937, the average temperature in January is -4.7 degrees Celsius, with a minimum of -18.9 degrees Celsius. The average temperature in July is 26.7 degrees Celsius, with a maximum of 40 degrees Celsius. The average annual temperature is 12 degrees Celsius. According to recent weather records, on June 11, 1946, the highest temperature was 37.7 degrees Celsius, and on January 26, 1947, the lowest temperature was -15.9 degrees Celsius. The sea surface outside Dagu Port even froze over, a rare phenomenon in the past decade.

4. Rainfall: According to records from 1909 to 1937, the average annual rainfall in Tanggu is 503.7 millimeters, with July and August having the most rainfall, accounting for about 74.5% of the annual rainfall. The average number of rainy days per year is 53. However, in 1946, the average rainfall was 835.8 millimeters, with the highest rainfall on August 16, totaling 201.9 millimeters.

5. Ice: The period of ice formation near the mouth of the Hai River is usually from mid-December to the end of February of the following year, lasting about two and a half months. The thickness of the ice varies with the climate. On January 26 of this year (1947), the temperature was -15.9 degrees Celsius, and the estuary was frozen until late February. When the wind direction changed from northwest to east, the ice floes drifted away, and navigation resumed.

6. Fog: Foggy days are rare in Tanggu, and the duration of fog is also very short. On average, there are no more than six to seven foggy days per year.

1. Absolute Specific Gravity

First Mud Sample: Tanggu Pier No. 1

Second Mud Sample: East End of New Port Lock

Third Mud Sample: Tianjin Customs Pier

Compared with the specific gravity of the soil of the Yangzi River's Dangerous Rapids, which is 2.75, and the specific gravity of the soil of Pudong Malu Bridge in Shanghai, which is 2.71, it can be seen that the soil of Tanggu is heavier than that of the Yangzi River's Dangerous Rapids, and the soil of Tianjin is also slightly heavier than that of Shanghai.

According to the above standards, the analysis of the soil of Tanggu shows that it contains less sand and more clay, with fine and loose particles, similar to the silt of the Yangzi River's Dangerous Rapids. As for the soil of Tianjin, it contains more sand than clay and is coarser than the soil of Shanghai. The percentage composition of the soil is shown in the attached table.

From the attached table, the soil of Tanggu contains 26% sand and 58% clay. The soil is fine and mobile, with a small natural slope angle and extremely high lateral pressure. In construction engineering, this type of soil is easily compressed, and the ground formed by filling settles faster. Therefore, special attention must be paid to the architectural design of wharves, warehouses, and land facilities.

The new port is located on the north side of the Hai River. Because the Hai River carries sediment downstream, it accumulates outside Dagu Port, forming the Fuyi River (commonly known as the Dagu Dam), which has always been an obstacle to navigation. The purpose of building the port in Tanggu is to avoid the Dagu Dam and open up a new waterway. The newly built locks, wharves, and all equipment enable 3,000-ton ships to reach Tianjin directly through the new waterway and locks at any time. Larger ships can dock in the port to load and unload goods. The equipment and operation of each important project are described below:

Geological Exploration

Geology is closely related to port construction planning. The geology of the coastal area of Tanggu is alluvial. At the beginning of the construction of the port, the Japanese conducted geological explorations every 3,000 meters along the north and south sides of the new port, extending from the coast into the sea, with six explorations for each layer of seabed geology. Three more explorations were conducted on the shore, inside the port, and north of the north breakwater, for a total of fifteen explorations. The depth ranged from 35 to 50 meters. The results showed that the surface layer of the strata was mostly brown mud, about 6 inches deep, followed by dark brown clay. This layer was the most extensive, with some depths reaching 14 meters. Below that were dark brown sandy clay, brown or gray fine clayey sand, fine coarse sand, fine sand, gray clay, etc., with occasional shell fragments mixed in. The layers varied in depth and were uneven, but in short, they were nothing more than these several kinds of sedimentary soil.

Soil Testing

The absolute specific gravity and particle analysis tests were conducted on the soil behind the New Port No. 1 pier and the east end of the lock, and compared with the soil of Tianjin and Shanghai. The results of each test are described below:

Specific Gravity: 2.880

Specific Gravity: 2.798

Specific Gravity: 2.716

Soil Particle Analysis

The soil classification of the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Bureau of Chemistry and Soils was adopted as the standard for testing. The classification is as follows:

Transverse Breakwater

The construction of breakwaters is to prevent the intrusion of sediment and the attack of northwest winds. The south breakwater starts from the lock and extends directly into the deep sea, about 17 kilometers long. The north breakwater starts from the second pier and extends into the sea in a trapezoidal shape, 10 kilometers long. Only a part of each has been completed. Because the foundation is formed by the sedimentation of mud and sand and the geology is loose, the rubble mound method is used for the dike construction. The lower part is filled with stones that sink down, and concrete blocks are laid on the dike to stabilize the foundation. A transverse breakwater of 650 meters long is also built within the confluence to prevent sea waves from affecting the port and to maintain the calmness of the water surface within the inner harbor, which is convenient for ships to dock.

Channel Excavation

A channel is excavated between the north and south breakwaters, connecting the deep sea to the east and connecting to the Hai River through the lock. It is about 13.4 kilometers long. The original designed width was 200 meters, and the excavated width is 130 meters, with a depth of 5 meters. Because the breakwaters are not completed, the channel is silted up due to the impact of tidal currents. Although dredging efforts have been made, the expected results have not been achieved. After the work was stopped, the channel silted up more and more severely. From August 1945 to September 1946, the siltation was more than one meter in one year, especially near the lock and the first and second piers. The water depth was only between 2 and 3 meters, and the remaining part was about 3 meters.

The berthing area in front of the first and second piers is about 1,400 meters long and 400 meters wide, including the channel. The original excavation depth was 6 meters. According to the actual measurement in September 1946, the average water depth was only about 2 meters, and the severity of the siltation can be imagined.

Land Reclamation

The land reclamation project involves reclaiming about 5,000 meters of land from the coastline on the left bank of the Hai River to the sea, forming 32 million square meters of port land. The amount of earthwork used is about 13 million cubic meters.

Wharves and Locks

In order to facilitate the berthing of ships, it is planned to build the first and second piers from west to east along the south side of the reclaimed land. The first pier is 700 meters long, and about 90% of the revetment project has been completed and can be used. The second pier is 350 meters long and 8 meters deep. 60% of the revetment project has been completed. There are two coal loading machines for the export of coal and salt. However, after the Japanese surrendered, most of the electric motor iron enamel skinning was stolen, and almost all previous efforts were in vain.

In order to enable ships to reach Tianjin directly without waiting for the tide, the lock was built. The lock is located on the north bank of the Hai River estuary, connecting the outer port to the east and the Hai River to the west. Its purpose is to allow the sediment from the Hai River to enter the sea through the original channel, so as to avoid silting up the port, and to open and close the gates according to the high and low tides to adjust the water level, so that navigation can be carried out at any time. A delta is also set up 20 meters upstream of the lock on the river side to prevent sediment from the Hai River from flowing into the bottom of the lock. The lock is 180 meters long and 21 meters wide. The lock body is built of reinforced concrete, and the gate is a sliding type, which is opened and closed by a 75-horsepower electric motor. The water level is about 5 meters, and ships under 3,000 tons can pass through at any time.

### On the Salaries of Civil Servants

— Luo Bida

With the recent adjustment of civil servant salaries, the basic amount in the Beijing and Shanghai areas is 340,000 yuan, plus 1,800 times the base salary. The so-called base salary is the grade salary, which is stipulated by the Civil Servant Grading Regulations. The current Civil Servant Grading Regulations were revised and promulgated by the National Government on November 1, 1945, through legislative procedures. The full text consists of 16 articles, which are simple and concise, and there are many commendable points, but it is still not perfect. Now, based on my limited understanding, I would like to offer suggestions for improvement, and I sincerely hope that wise scholars will provide guidance.

First, the regulations stipulate that newly appointed senior and recommended-rank personnel shall be graded starting from the lowest grade of their respective positions (Article 3). This provision seems unfair and unreasonable. According to this provision, a newly appointed recommended-rank clerk should be assigned to the lowest grade of a recommended-rank clerk, which is the 12th grade of the recommended rank. The monthly salary for the 12th grade of the recommended rank is 180 yuan, which is 20 yuan less than the monthly salary of 200 yuan for the 1st grade of the appointed rank. However, one of the qualifications for the recommended rank is having served in the highest-grade appointed position for more than three years, with only those who pass the assessment remaining (Article 3, Paragraph 3 of the current Civil Servant Appointment Law). In this way, although one is promoted from the appointed rank to the recommended rank, the monthly salary is reduced. From the perspective of the psychological state of those who are promoted, this is certainly unpleasant.

Perhaps some people think that rank and salary should be separate, rank is rank, and salary is salary, and it is even possible not to receive a salary. But this is ultimately a special case and is limited to the highest-level officials. As for lower-level civil servants, it is unprecedented to serve without pay. Usually, officials are paid, and promotion brings a pay raise. Therefore, when personnel in the highest grade of the appointed rank are promoted to the recommended rank, if the lowest grade of their position is below the 10th grade of the recommended rank, it seems inappropriate to rigidly stipulate that they should be graded starting from the lowest grade of their position.

If the rigid provisions of the law are fair and reasonable, they can not only be implemented but also guarantee good implementation, and of course, they should be rigidly stipulated; otherwise, there will be extra-legal provisions, thereby reducing the spirit of law-abiding among the general public. For example, Article 3 of the Explanatory Section of the Provisional Official Rank and Salary Table for Civil Officials (revised and promulgated by the National Government on March 4, 1946) stipulates: "Those who pass the higher-level examination and are appointed as recommended-rank clerks shall be graded starting from the 10th grade of the recommended rank." Another example is the table for calculating seniority in the Supplementary Measures for Civil Servant Appointment, which stipulates that graduates with specialized works that have been reviewed and qualified can be graded starting from the 10th grade of the recommended rank. Further, on November 30, 1944, the Ministry of Personnel handled the grading case for Wang Xuezeng, a recommended-rank clerk in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and determined that those who had served in the 1st grade of the appointed rank and were transferred to the recommended-rank clerk position should be graded starting from the 10th grade of the recommended rank.

Due to these exceptions, the provision that newly appointed recommended-rank personnel should be graded starting from the lowest grade of their position can no longer maintain its dignity and integrity. Legislation outside the law and law on top of the law have resulted in a proliferation of laws, making people unsure of what to follow. It would be better to revise the original articles and abolish the exceptional provisions.

Second, the regulations stipulate that newly appointed appointed-rank personnel who meet the provisions of Article 4, Paragraph 4 of the Civil Servant Appointment Law shall be graded starting from the 8th to the 6th grade (Article 4, Paragraph 1, Item 3). Article 4, Paragraph 4 of the Civil Servant Appointment Law refers to the provision that those who have devoted themselves to the National Revolution for more than five years and have achieved results that have been proven to be true. Those who meet this provision should be graded starting from the 10th to the 6th grade, which also seems inappropriate. Because those who have devoted themselves to the National Revolution for more than seven years and have achieved results that have been proven to be true are qualified for the recommended rank (Article 3, Paragraph 4 of the Civil Servant Appointment Law). Those who have devoted themselves to the National Revolution for more than ten years and have made meritorious contributions that have been proven to be true are even qualified for the senior rank (Article 2, Paragraph 4 of the Civil Servant Appointment Law). The difference between five years or more and less than seven years is very small, so the difference in grade salary should also be very close. Moreover, the quality of the achievements and the length of time are not absolutely proportional. The achievements of those who have devoted themselves to the National Revolution for five years or more but less than seven years may be better than those who have devoted themselves to the National Revolution for seven years or more, or even ten years or more. Therefore, we believe that it should be revised to: those who meet the provisions of Article 4, Paragraph 4 of the Civil Servant Appointment Law shall be graded starting from the 8th to the 1st grade. As for the determination of the starting grade within the specified range, it should be determined based on the achievements, time, academic qualifications, experience, and work ability of the proposed personnel who have devoted themselves to the National Revolution.

The regulations stipulate that newly appointed appointed-rank personnel who are graduates of junior colleges or above shall be graded starting from the 5th to the 4th grade (Article 4, Paragraph 1, Item 2); graduates of senior high schools shall be graded starting from the 9th grade (Article 4, Paragraph 1, Item 4); graduates of junior high schools shall be graded starting from the 16th to the 10th grade (Article 4, Paragraph 1, Item 5). However, graduates of senior and junior high schools are limited to those who have the qualifications specified in the relevant appointment law (Article 4, Paragraph 2). This provision seems debatable.

Junior colleges recruit senior high school graduates, and the length of study is mostly two years. Senior high schools recruit junior high school graduates, and the length of study is three years. In this way, the length of study for junior college graduates is only two years longer than that of senior high school graduates, but the starting grade salary is four or even five grades higher. However, the length of study for senior high school graduates is three years longer than that of junior high school graduates, but the difference in the highest starting grade is only one grade, which seems too small. It is appropriate to grade junior college graduates or above starting from the 5th to the 4th grade; the starting grade for senior high school graduates seems to lack uniformity, and it is advisable to restore the provisions of the old regulations, changing the starting grade from the 9th to the 8th grade. It is advisable to revise the starting grade for junior high school graduates to the 16th to the 12th grade.

Furthermore, we believe that within the prescribed limits, the starting grade of the proposed personnel should be determined based on the following standards:

(1) Whether the academic experience is commensurate with the nature of the proposed position. If it is commensurate, it should be higher, and if it is not commensurate, it should be lower, so that the academic experience can be used and the purpose of expert politics can be achieved.

(2) The quality of academic performance in school. Those with excellent performance should be higher, and those with poor performance should be lower, in order to cooperate with academic education and imply the use of diligent academic performance.

(3) Whether there is administrative or economic experience. Those with experience should be higher, and those without experience should be lower.

(4) The strength of work ability. Those who are strong should be higher, and those who are weak should be lower.

(5) The length of the statutory length of study. For example, if the statutory length of study for junior colleges is two years and the statutory length of study for universities is four years, the latter should be higher, and the former should be lower, which seems fairer and more reasonable.

Fourth, regarding students who drop out of school and become civil servants, their academic qualifications are not recognized by the regulations, which seems debatable. Of course, students should be encouraged to graduate, but in an unstable society, and under the current situation where the cost of school is too high, the number of those who have to drop out of school midway is increasing year by year, and the income of civil servants is difficult to maintain even their own food and clothing, and they are struggling with hunger; the huge school fees paid are mostly obtained by selling books, antiques, treasures, clothing, and borrowing; if there is no way to sell advertisements and no way to borrow, and it is not possible to gun down or steal, the academic qualifications of students who drop out of school and become civil servants should be recognized, and the starting grade should be based on the graduation qualifications before dropping out of school. According to their academic performance and the number of years of study, the starting grade may be increased by one or two grades.

Finally, we must especially solemnly put forward one point; that is, "orders cannot change the provisions of the law." Now the constitution has been promulgated, and constitutional government is about to begin, and there should be a spirit of the rule of law. The constitution should be higher than the law, and the law should be higher than the order. Orders cannot conflict with the law, and the law cannot violate the constitution. Laws that violate the constitution should be invalid, and orders that conflict with the law should also be invalid. This is the basic principle of the rule of law in the constitutional era. The current Civil Servant Grading Regulations were revised and promulgated by the National Government on November 1, 1945, through legislative procedures. According to the provisions of the Standard Law for the formulation of laws, anything promulgated by the National Government through legislative procedures is called law, which includes regulations. Therefore, the current Civil Servant Grading Regulations are of course law. The "Explanatory Section of the Provisional Official Rank and Salary Table for Civil Officials" was ordered to be implemented by the National Government on March 4, 1946, and has not gone through legislative procedures, so it is certainly not law, but an order. Furthermore, the Ministry of Personnel's appointment and grading determination case has neither gone through legislative procedures nor been promulgated by the National Government, so its effectiveness is of course lower than law and lower than the orders of the National Government. However, the current Civil Servant Grading Regulations stipulate that newly appointed recommended-rank personnel shall be graded starting from the lowest grade of their position (Article 3), and the lowest grade of the recommended-rank clerk position is the 12th grade of the recommended rank, and newly appointed recommended-rank personnel should be graded starting from the 12th grade of the recommended rank according to law. However, the "Explanatory Section of the Provisional Official Rank and Salary Table for Civil Officials" stipulates that those who pass the higher-level examination and are appointed as recommended-rank clerks shall be graded starting from the 10th grade of the recommended rank (Explanation Article 3), and the Ministry of Personnel's appointment and grading case determines that those who are promoted from the appointed rank to the recommended-rank clerk position shall be graded starting from the 10th grade of the recommended rank. Isn't this obviously an order changing the law, denying the provisions of the law? Although this change is reasonable, and this denial is in line with the principles of making laws based on reason and emotion, it should be changed, but in the spirit of the rule of law, this approach is inappropriate. Laws are drafted by experts and discussed by legislators, and are mostly very ideal when the legislative process is just completed; but when they are actually applied, it is inevitable that flaws will be discovered. However, the provisions of the law cannot be changed by order simply because there are flaws; nor can the law be enforced to the end regardless of whether the results are good or bad simply because there are provisions of the law. Implementation should be in accordance with the law, and the law that is perfect is ideal. Since the current Civil Servant Grading Regulations need to be revised, I hope that the legislative authorities can revise them, so that the grading of civil servants can be fair and reasonable, and that even though the salaries of civil servants are meager and their lives are hard, they can still work with peace of mind. I submit this to wise scholars for their consideration; I wonder what they think?

Spring and Autumn

### The Prophet

— Min Zi

God's prophet, the supreme seeker—Ar-Istafal, told the people in the city of Afalis everything between life and death, and then took his sailboat back to the Isle of Eternal Life.

When he parted with the people of Afalis, he said:

"My days among you are short, and the words I speak are even shorter.

"But when my voice becomes blurred in your ears and my love disappears from your memory, I will come again.

"I will speak with a fuller heart and more inspired lips.

"Yes, I will return with the tide.

"Although death will hide me, and greater silence will surround me, I will seek your understanding.

"And lo, my seeking will not be in vain.

"If all that I have spoken is truth, this truth will be revealed in clearer voices and plainer words."

Now decades have passed, and the prophet's voice has become blurred in people's ears and dim in their memories.

He came to Afalis again on that sailboat from the Isle of Eternal Life.

The female prophet Ermesha came out of the temple to greet this "dawn of the modern age" who was loved by the people.

Ermesha said to him:

Speak the truth to us in voices as clear as streams! Reveal the "truth" to us in clearer words, without any obscurity.

God's prophet smiled softly.

Time

Time is the most ruthless character. It has dragged me away from you for decades, and it has taken away my voice that leaped deep in your hearts.

It doesn't run fast for your sake, and it doesn't stop its forward steps for you either.

Like a stream, it flows very self-importantly day and night.

Do you want to know its power? -- It will drag you from the cradle all the way into the grave.

You work, you love, without any gaps, just like it.

In this way, it can only drag your body away, and your spirit will be immortal;

Otherwise, along with your stinky skin, everything will be reduced to illusion.

Only the future belongs to you, and the past has become the history in the hands of historians; then it will be sent to later generations for ruthless criticism: is it good or evil?

Live well, be a good person. O people of Afalis! Time does not have any difference because there are rich and poor.

Thrift

This is a good word, but it's not the best.

God has never created this word, just as God does not want you to indulge in sensuality.

This is like a plate of precious delicacies, which is superfluous luxury for people who are being eroded by natural and man-made disasters, but those who are tired of sensuality need it. But they insist on giving this dish to people who don't like it.

Millions of pieces of tree bark and Guanyin flour.

Millions of bowls of chaff and wheat paste,

Can't compare to half a seat of chicken tail wine.

(O people of Afalis! Do you understand the term "cocktail"?)

People whose minds are blinded by luxury and sensuality are precisely the ones who are calling for the slogan of thrift in voices as moving as singing, but they themselves are exceptions. Just like the emperors of the past who made laws but were not bound by them themselves.

Remember: A pretty good lie is a beautiful song.

But the highest intellect will never be blinded by songs. Because thrift has become a harsh demand for you.

Use the hands that you use to dig tree bark to dig your own path, the spring of the sensualists has passed, and the cold winter of wind and snow is coming.

Marriage

The marriage system, like two livestock, combined under the master's shouts of "Hey! Live together well," has passed.

So you understand love, and know that you not only seek the union of the body, but also seek a deeper confluence and tacit understanding of hearts.

The big bellies are innately aware of this truth.

Their extravagant and luxurious lives are the bait for fishing, and only the poor and humble fish will take the hook.

One day, they fall down from their decadent lives, and the cornerstone of unstable love collapses with it.

The mediator of a good marriage is never gold bars and beauty bans, have you ever seen the nightingale's courtship for material needs?

A beautiful appearance will not necessarily wrap a beautiful and kind heart, such a choice is a foolish silkworm, a foolish mistake.

You must love each other, drink milk together, but also drink bitter wine together.

A string can only play a monotonous note, it must be played with two strings to be harmonious.

Show each other your hearts, without any concealment.

A good marriage is the beginning of a career; otherwise, it is useless to use the hands of two people to tie your own feet, it is faster than one person.

Friendship

Friendship is the most precious thing in the world. But it is not a gemstone, but it is more enviable than a gemstone.

It is not built on a material foundation. If you and your friend have obtained it through competing for wine and food, this is like a tower built on gravel.

Friendship can have no other purpose than deepening each other's minds, deepening love, and understanding.

It is like a gentle hand,

It wipes away your tears, soothes your wounds, and gives your pain the highest comfort.

It is also like the spring breeze, sticking closely to your heart so warmly. There is nothing sweeter or gentler in the world than this.

It is even better than a mother's heart.

Friendship is not a commodity. You should not be stingy when someone asks you for it, you should give it generously;

But when it is not needed, you should not sell it cheaply like inferior goods.

### Bamboo Sparrow

— Tang Yun

### Preface to Yutang's Seal Album

— Ma Gongyu

The making of seals originated in ancient times, developed gradually, and flourished in the Han Dynasty. Making seals must follow the Han Dynasty, just like writing in the Jin Dynasty and poetry in the Tang Dynasty. However, ancient seals mostly used gold and jade as materials, and engraving and carving were two separate matters. Although those who made seals were proficient in various schools, the labor of casting and chiseling was often entrusted to craftsmen; therefore, it was rare for scholars to be known for engraving seals. In the Yuan and Ming Dynasties, there was the production of flowery milky stone, which was brittle and easy to be cut, allowing it to reach perfection at will. Scholars often liked to use this to express their emotions, so seal engravers emerged in large numbers. However, when literature prevails, quality is lacking, people do not study the ancients, and they create and flaunt themselves, competing for novelty; although the engraving is skillful, the seal script is violated, and the meaning of the seal is obscured. In the Qing Dynasty, the study of bronze and stone inscriptions flourished, and seal engraving entered the right path, with the Zhe and Wan schools as the return. Zhao Beifu of Kuaiji, alone melted and forged the strengths of various schools, and pioneered a new realm; his works were the most elegant and docile, but learning his steps was quite difficult. Qian Zijun Tao, has been engraving seals for many years, works hard, seeking to be like Bei Hui, and has fully grasped its essence. After accumulating rich drafts, he will gather and rub them to ask the world, and I will write a preface for him. I have always respected Bei Wei, and I am happy that Jun Tian can choose good and learn from it, which is different from the current trend of closing the door and creating things out of thin air and boasting about them. I once said that although seal engraving is a minor art, it cannot be accomplished without both talent and human effort; it is not enough to simply hold the old scores to speak of the big; one must be proficient in the seal script, have a thorough understanding of bronze and stone objects and characters, simplify them, connect them, combine the ancient without being rigid, and innovate and stand out on one's own; one can respond handily with a chisel, with plenty of room. This is where Bei Wei's victory over others lies. Jun Tao's seal engraving is already very similar to Bei Wei, and if he goes further to learn from his teacher, then it will not be difficult to temporarily replace Bei Wei. However, Jun Tao is modest, is involved in many things, and is proficient in calligraphy, literature, phonology, and music. How can he only be passed down as a seal engraver in the future! So I am happy to write a preface for him.

### Blessing of Youth

— Li Wendong

Opening the window, a gust of good wind hits my face, making my heart sway, a oleander tree is full of spring light, for a long time, I have lost this kind of youth's expectation.

I often think of the Dutch painter Van Gogh's landscape painting titled "Spring", under the vast, gloomy sky filled with gray clouds and haze; the wind in various places lingers in the wilderness, with a little doubt and a little hesitation. In front of a low thatched house, in a poor and desolate field, a lonely peach tree silently lowers its head, enduring loneliness and spring cold, spitting out a few bleak small flowers, it is growing stubbornly in a firm posture, and the sound of blood flowing seems to be still rolling in the branches, this sound is very similar to the boatman's song that rises from the Jialing River, full of desolation and full of confidence.

This is a real, bleak spring, and it is also the fate of our generation, all our youth has been dedicated to the war of resistance.

Early on, I was overwhelmed by a kind of thought, and like a low wintergreen in front of the window, I completely became a little old man. The aging of the heart happened after returning to the east, as for the physical aspect, long-term work and wandering made my youth wither. But at that time, the heart was still strong, until the victory returned, I happily returned to my childhood Jiangnan, and when I returned to Jiangnan, it changed, my childhood friends had become strangers, the girl I loved had become an aunt, and there was a girl whom I had hugged and teased when she was in her infancy, and now she was too shy to raise her head when she saw me, and I also heard that she had learned about love. There were more who had already passed away, some died under the "appeasement" of the Imperial Army, some died in exile and epidemics, some sought short sights, and some simply lost them in a muddle.

From these constant births and deaths, I first felt the aging of youth.

Du Fu said in his poem to Wei Ba Chushi:

"...; how long can youth be, the temples are already gray

Visiting the old half for ghosts, exclaiming in the heat of the heart

..."

I didn't find any meaning in reading it when I was a child, but now when I read it, my heart beats non-stop, just like Dante's line; "Halfway along the road of my life..." At that time, the French writer France read it and threw it aside casually, but later when he entered middle age himself, he accidentally read this line again, and his whole body trembled.

The momentary realization made me shiver, and at that time it was still winter, and the cold and loneliness were pressing closer and closer, and the situation was quite embarrassing. When I thought of the days when I had lived, loved, worked, and suffered, those days were full of hunger, bombing, massacre, exile, love and tears, enthusiasm and dreams...

But spring still came as usual, everything was the old label, and there was no difference from the spring we encountered in the past, the spring of Hankou, the spring of Chongqing, the spring of Chengdu, the spring of Kunming, and the spring of the battlefield, life may have been an easy-to-fall banquet.

Now I have returned to the spring in Jiangnan, and young men and women are hanging a song called "Roses bloom everywhere" on their lips, I have never heard this song before, they sing it vigorously, and when I walk past them, they don't look at me at all.

The spring in Jiangnan is so beautiful, the sunlight makes my eyes dazzled, a small river flows vividly, a apricot blossom is red and charming; on the river bank, the grass is green, the green wheat seedlings and the yellow rapeseed flowers, the white clouds are stretching in the sky, on the road, pairs and pairs of flower-selling girls are flying and sending charming eyes, putting all the amorous feelings on the corners of their eyes, the clever young men are flirting and scolding, and the girls are ashamed and cover their faces and laugh. This is so good! It's just that I'm already old, like the amorous Turgenev standing on a desolate post station, saying goodbye to the past, and giving them blessings with a sad and sweet mood:

"The future belongs to you, your life will be easier than ours, and you will no longer be forced to search for roads, struggle, fall and get up in the black stage. We have to find the strength that supports us in pain, and many of us have failed—but you, you just have to work hard, such a blessing from me is for you, although I have sadness, but I have no jealousy, and no dark emotion..."

The song of life never ceases, singing down one after another, exchanging for new days and seasons, and we have already lived, loved, and suffered... Besides blessing you, what else is there to say?

### Yellow Sand

— Chen Ying

I am afraid of the season when yellow sand falls.

I am afraid of the sand that obscures my eyes...

The bright sunny day outside the window suddenly turned yellow and turbid. A strong wind撲向the window sill, and also樸向me.

This is another day of drifting yellow sand.

When the land is immersed in the confusing wind and sand, there are old shepherds who sigh in melancholy. Some people also say that the travelers and camels walking in the desert are buried by the sand dunes, and there will be no news of him forever.

And my heart also palpitates on this moldy day.

When the yellow sand falls on the mountains and fields, on the roof of every house, when the yellow sand falls on the bridgehead, on the road extending to the distance; then, I see in the hazy sand mist, the hills are like floating small islands one by one, and the dove-colored clouds are like withered daisies.

But, I can't see the sun, I can't see the rows of flags walking on the road.

Although, the blurred wind and sand, seals everyone's eyes, and our breathing is closer, our hands are holding tighter, our active hearts will meet the refreshing blue sky that scratches through the dense sand nets...

### On Watching the Jinshan Idle Gulls Collaborate on Painting Fans, I Immediately Wrote

— Lü Baihua

The misty peaks hide the eyebrows, the autumn water dims the eyes; holding a staff, I would rather leave my nature behind, the sound of pine mixes with the Hui merchants. (June 15th)

### Roman Rolland on Writing

— Yan Chuan

French literary giant Roman Rolland had several valuable opinions on writing, which are very useful for beginners. Now, I excerpt them below:

1.  First piece of advice: Unless you urgently feel driven by social responsibility, your conscience, or some kind of inner need, never write. Merely participating in the already numerous ranks of writers for the sake of delusion or vanity is not only useless but also harmful.

2.  When writing, one must be honest. A writer should only write the truth, write what you think, see, and believe.

3.  A writer must strive to narrate the truth with the greatest possible accuracy, precision, and directness, as well as the simplest form; herein lies the whole secret of style. When a writer has no regrets in this regard, he can write very well. But this is very difficult, because a writer must constantly work hard to liberate thoughts from their shells, from their dust, from all the darkness, confusion, and unnecessary things that cover them.

4.  Such labor must be done by oneself, because each person must fight against his own shortcomings, and everyone is his own judge. However, this effort can be greatly facilitated by great and excellent classical literary masterpieces. A writer should study the overall structure, organization of chapters, the construction of sentences within these chapters, the logic of thought, and the value of words in these masterpieces.

### A Hundred Quatrains on Wu Ballads

— Shu Zi

Although I lived in Suzhou for more than a year before, I was never interested in the local literature of Suzhou. Not to mention ordinary poetry collections, I felt sleepy just flipping through the table of contents of "Wu County Literary Compilation." The reason is that I had no interest in small, decorative local anecdotes. Occasionally, I skimmed through some local Wu documents, but mostly popular books, such as "Wu Xia Xian Lian" and "Wu Ge Shi Chao." Being a common person, my attention was limited to common things. My purpose was only to gain some scattered knowledge of customs and language from books.

Among this type of book that records common events, I liked several kinds, and Cai Yun's "A Hundred Quatrains on Wu Ballads" is just one of them.

The original book has one volume, published in the eleventh year of Tongzhi, Renshen. The book has a postscript by Shi _, which describes the process of carving the book, saying:

"Mr. Cai _ Geng of Yuanhe, with his writing _ bore a heavy name, and usually there were dozens of students following him. After his death, his disciple Cheng Gengtang (_ Mei) Xiaolian carved his complete collection of poetry and prose, which was around the early years of Daoguang. At that time, I had his collection, but lost it after the chaos. Recently, I copied his "A Hundred Quatrains on Wu Ballads" in one volume, and my brother-in-law, Su Jun Yaqing...re-carved it. I am happy that it highlights literature and can be used for old news in Wu. The carving has been completed, and I have described the whole process as such."

According to Cai’s given name Yun, styled Liqing, with the sobriquet Tie Geng, was from Yuanxiang, born during the Qianlong and Jiaqing period. He authored: “Cai's Monthly Ordinances with Commentary” in four volumes, “Pitan” in four volumes, and “Borrowing Autumn Pavilion Poetry Drafts” in eight volumes, see Cao Yunyuan's "Wu County Chronicle" Volume 58 (Part 1) "Arts and Literature Examination" (4). There is also "Borrowing Autumn Pavilion Examination Essays." According to Shi Tian's postscript, "A Hundred Quatrains on Wu Ballads" seemed to have been originally carved in "Poetry Drafts." The single-edition book has a preface by Cai at the beginning, unsigned and undated, and it is unknown when it was written. The preface says:

"Yun was born and raised in the Wu market, naturally a Wu simpleton, singing Wu ditties, roughly discussing Wu customs. Collecting the best of the year, searching for the latest news from the three counties; storing ballads in the poetry gourd, hiding advice in jokes. It covers everything at the time, which can be sung and can be told." The main theme of the whole book is nothing more than singing and describing the customs of the seasons, slightly like willow branches and bamboo branches.

Gu Lu (Tieqing) "Qingjia Records" quotes many poems praising Wu customs, and often cites Zhou Zongtai's "Gusu Bamboo Branch Lyrics" (six poems) and Cai's "A Hundred Quatrains on Wu Ballads," with the most citations from Cai's poems, totaling more than seventy items, accounting for a quarter of Cai's original book. However, the annotations attached to the original poems were mostly deleted by "Qingjia Records," and even when the original poems were quoted, the annotations were removed. In our view, the annotations are more important than the poems (the annotations mostly record Wu customs in detail). Gu's deletion is truly "returning the pearl and keeping the casket." It is fortunate to see the original book, as the original face is better than just seeing Xian Shi's deleted version.

There are a hundred poems in total, no different from ordinary bamboo branch words, but the annotations are quite detailed. For example: "Watching the leftover candles at the Lantern Festival, racing out to the boat to solicit blessings. Not letting the moonlight soak the lower realm, a shining pole and a lamp tower and a star bridge." The annotation says:

"On the thirteenth, watching the big pile of grain at Liu Mengjiang Temple, the candles are several feet high. On the fifteenth night, the gongs and drums are played for fun, called 'noisy Lantern Festival.' The land parade imitates the sounds of the dragon boat race, which is what the Stone Lake Poem's own note calls 'rowing a dry boat.' The dragon boat turns and rotates, commonly known as 'hitting the beckon.' Fireworks are made like firecrackers, planted on long poles and set off in the county, city, and walls, all sprayed out of the fire. Each time one is set off, there are several stories. All the bridges must be manned, and frames are placed like towers, with lights on each floor. The streets and alleys are also equipped with poles and ropes to make bridge lights. According to the 'Stone Lake Poetry Collection,' the Lantern Festival market is full of lights, including myriad-eyed nets and glass balls, which are especially wonderful. Today's customs only have these kinds and children's toys. The lantern decorations are at their peak between the second and the fifth, but they are still done every other year."

Another example is the poem about the New Year: "The stove mountain screen hangs, the well is sealed with orchids, burning the first incense and worshiping the joyful face. A hundred-year-old coin is distributed on a plate, and ten-thousand-year grain is offered on the table." The annotation says:

"The common people call the stove door the stove mountain, with _ offerings to the spirit horses, and after the welcoming sacrifice, it is covered with a curtain. No water is drawn for the first three days of the new year, and spirit horses are offered at the well's posterity, sacrificed and robbed, called sealing. On New Year's Day, incense is burned early to be pious, and there are people rushing to burn the first incense at midnight. Hanging ancestral portraits, or collecting them after five days or half a month. Fruits are distributed to children in a tray, with a hundred-year-old coin inside. At the beginning of the year, it is taboo not to wash rice, and leave it for several days to offer it, called ten-thousand-year grain."

Another example is the Dragon Boat Festival: "The heavy hammer dumplings are piled on a plate, good to serve with several cups of realgar wine, the remaining drips can still dispel the five poisons, spraying on the foreheads of the messy children and the door lintel." The annotation says:

"Glutinous rice without horns is called heavy hammer dumplings, a Dragon Boat Festival item. Drink Wanman wine during the Dragon Boat Festival, now mixed with realgar. The common people regard toads, lizards, spiders, snakes, and centipedes as the five poisons."

The records are all detailed and worth seeing, one level higher than Lu Gao. Therefore, the annotations are more worthy of attention.

In books that record Wu customs, previous people had Fan Chengda's "Stone Lake Yuefu," Huang Sheng's "Wu Feng Lu," and Wang Angdeng's "Wu She Compilation"; recent people have: Ju Zhenhe's "Suzhou Customs" and Gu Zhenyu's "Suzhou Customs Talk," etc. If they can be classified and compiled, it can also become a book like "A Classified Collection of Beijing Customs," and "A Hundred Quatrains on Wu Ballads" is one of the important materials for this book. But this matter seems impossible to talk about at the moment.

### Sixth Sense and Eighth Consciousness

— Chen Ziqi

Professor Rhine, a psychologist at Duke University in the United States, and his assistant spent seventeen years of research to prove that a person has a sixth sense in addition to the five senses of sight, hearing, smell, taste, and touch. This sixth sense is also called extrasensory perception. All mentally normal and sensitive people have the possibility of this sixth sense. Its function is to predict things and events that have not been seen, without being blocked by space and time; it can perceive the same pain as its relatives, and even suffer the same misfortune. This extrasensory perception is particularly significant in people who have a close relationship, such as twins and couples. The famous American Happiness magazine has given many examples to prove this significant discovery in psychology. This is indeed a very surprising thing.

However, as far as I know personally, this sixth sense is the eighth consciousness mentioned in the Buddhist scriptures, also called Alaya consciousness. The seventh consciousness is Manas consciousness, and the sixth consciousness is consciousness. The scope of this eighth consciousness is very broad, and it interacts with all mankind and various organisms on the earth. Everyone has it (regardless of whether he is mentally normal). Not only everyone has it, but every animal has it, no matter how small it is. Of course, mothers and children, couples, have a close relationship, and the function of this eighth consciousness is easily discovered. Twins have the same aura, and its function is particularly significant.

For example: in our history, there is such a record, saying: Zengzi's mother, one day because she had an urgent matter, hoped that her son would return from outside, so she broke her own finger. Zengzi was chopping wood on the mountain, felt a burst of heart pain, knew that something must have happened at home, so he hurried home. He asked his mother and learned that his mother had bitten her finger because of some urgent matter. Also, we read Huang Zongyan's "Ten Thousand Li Search for Brother." Huang Tingfeng was inspired in a dream by his longing for his brother, and finally met his elder brother Bojun in a toilet in Daozhou. These are all inductions caused by the function of the eighth consciousness.

Some people say. This sixth sense is similar to the function of a thousand-mile eyes and hypnosis. Because after being hypnotized, the subject can clearly say what has been sealed in advance. Yes, the function of hypnosis and the function of a thousand-mile eyes are indeed related to extrasensory perception (that is, what I call the eighth consciousness). The subject of hypnosis must first stop consciousness and enter a hypnotic state before the function of extrasensory perception can occur. Buddhism teaches people to meditate, nothing more than to stop their own consciousness and let the eighth consciousness fully function, so as to achieve a state of inner and outer unity. However, although the principles here are interconnected, the realm of meditation is not something that those who learn to use a thousand-mile eyes and hypnosis can dream of.

Finally, the function of this eighth consciousness is not unknown even in Confucianism. The Doctrine of the Mean says: "Nothing can be reduced," which means that people should not rely solely on the usual sixth consciousness to measure everything. Because this consciousness is the most unreliable; it is the most unable to understand the truth of things, so if you want to understand the truth of things, you must stop the delusion of this consciousness, "stop at the highest good," and then you can discover the function of "manifesting virtue," and then you can be sincere and have things, and understand the truth of things. The so-called "the way of perfect sincerity can foreknow," that's the reason, the "manifesting virtue" mentioned in this skin is the substance of the eighth consciousness. Zengzi elaborates on its function, saying: "Up and down flows with heaven and earth," able to flow with heaven and earth up and down, what is that if not the eighth consciousness?

The Buddhist scriptures and treatises have very detailed explanations of the substance and function of this eighth consciousness. However, studying it is not an easy task. We welcome Professor Rhine and other psychologists who study the sixth sense to come to China to study the eighth consciousness in order to glimpse this mysterious universe!

### Attitude at Mealtime

— Guo Yongnian

Once, an experimental laboratory in the United States conducted an experiment. A cat was fed with rich and delicious food such as pig liver. After it fell asleep quietly on the ground, an X-ray machine was used to see its internal condition, and it was found that its food digestion was proceeding smoothly. Suddenly, a record player hidden behind the curtain made a burst of fierce dog barking. The cat immediately jumped up desperately, arched its back, erected its fur, and bared its teeth and claws. This was the external change. From the X-ray mirror, it was observed that the entire stomach was full of gastric juice, and the direction of the stomach's peristalsis was opposite to before. The delicious pig liver seemed like indigestible bricks in its stomach.

Looking back at us humans, the time when parents and children are most likely to meet in a day is at mealtime. At this time, the father often cannot help but teach and criticize the children's usual behavior, study results, etc., and the mother cannot help but defend the restriction of household expenses. Even the father himself. He may not be happy to have dinner with his family in this attitude. In this way, if an X-ray mirror is used to see the digestion of everyone's stomach, it will be the same as the experimental cat. Therefore, if people avoid talking about all unpleasant things when making food, the occurrence of indigestion, excessive kidney acid, and other stomach diseases in the world can be reduced a lot.

### Alice on Stage

— Guo Hua

"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland" is a famous fairy tale, and there are many Chinese translations. The author, Lewis Carroll, was a mathematics professor, but his fairy tale is incredible and whimsical, including talking rabbits and flying queens. As for the strange birds and monsters, there is no end to them. However, the good thing about this fairy tale is not its weirdness, but the fact that Alice, this little girl, still maintains a realistic character in the Wonderland, encountering all kinds of strange things. Although the environment is absurd and outrageous to the extreme, her every move is extremely rational. This can also be said to be a particularly worthwhile place to read in this fairy tale. Recently, this novel has been brought to the stage and is being performed at the "American Playhouse" in New York. The set design is exactly the same as Tenniel's illustrations in the original book. What's especially good is that Bambi Lynn's portrayal of Alice is exactly what the heroine in the book should be. Her gestures, voice, smile, and appearance are all the same as the character in the book. In other words, when the author wrote this book, it was as if he had Bambi Lynn in his mind.

### "Butterfly" on the Jeep

— Bao Qing

Jeep arrives, and girls follow everywhere.

American Jeeps have arrived in San Dao, and are no exception. They have formed a green relationship with Japanese girls. Those Japanese "butterflies" are also known for producing virtuous wives and good mothers. It is good to have a husband bring a woman home to sleep in the same bed with his wife and not think it is strange. American soldiers' comments are that they have "friendly qualities, gentle personalities, and their enthusiastic emotions to make men comfortable."

Last year's national census in Japan showed that there were about three million more women than men. Under this surplus situation, in the feudal social environment, and with the impending unemployment and famine today, the fate of Japanese women is even more tragic. Although Japanese women have the right to vote and participate in politics, they cannot solve the plight of those sisters.

At first, the vocational guidance department of the government's "Overseas Compatriots Relief Association" introduced women who came to ask for relief to work as hostesses, etc., when they had no other choice, and even they were willing to be concubines and prostitutes. Although on January 14 last year, MacArthur ordered the Japanese government to abolish all contracts and agreements restricting women from serving and deprived them of the right to legal prostitution. But this only removed a layer of exploitation for the poor prostitutes.

The American military not only moved the hearts of those self-proclaimed noble geishas, ​​but also many young girls threw themselves into their arms. A Japanese girl marrying an American soldier got her parents' permission because they could get bread, sugar, etc., and even US dollars, which shows the seriousness of the economic relationship.

These friendly events even made it to the American newspapers. In a photo taken by a Associated Press reporter, an American soldier was holding a smiling Japanese girl in his arms. A soldier's wife actually thought that the soldier was her husband and wanted to get a divorce, forcing the husband to find the photographer to prove that he was not. The American soldiers' families at home are worried about this kind of thing.

Under this situation, MacArthur had no choice but (on April 2 last year) to give a letter to Pastor Swihart, asking him to find a way to stop this "friendship" that was obscured by "obscenity." MacArthur believed that it was absolutely impossible to strictly prohibit contact with the Japanese, and it would not solve the problem, violating the inherent self-esteem and personal rights of American soldiers. Therefore, he hoped that they could maintain a high level of morality, otherwise, it would not only damage the reputation of the army and the prestige of the United States, but also make their families feel very sad. Therefore, he asked them to strictly abide by the two points of "self-restraint" and "self-cultivation."

Therefore, for their own sake and for the sake of the country, the Jeep warriors should also listen to the commander's words! The American troops in other places should also listen.

### May Loquats Fill the Woods

— Rui

According to the Compendium of Materia Medica; "Loquat, the leaves resemble a lute, hence the name," Guang Zhi says: "Loquat leaves are slightly like chestnuts, flowers in winter and fruits in spring, clustered fruits, hairy, ripe in April, large ones like _ seeds, small ones like longan, seedless ones are called Jiaozi." According to this, loquat fruits have become hot, but good varieties are always on the market around the Dragon Boat Festival. What Guang Zhi records are mostly Zhangcheng and other kinds.

Loquats have appeared in poems a lot, such as Guo Zhengxiang's poem: "I don't know where it is really comparable, I am afraid that the flying fruit has wax pills inside." Chen Ji's poem says: "The wind and dew fill the sky and the loquats are ripe, returning to offer to my loving mother to taste." Bai Juyi's poem: "The side of Huai Mountain is the shade of the Chu River, and the loquats fill the woods in May." Su Shi's poem: "The hawk orange is slightly yellow and still sour." Dai Shiping's poem: "The east garden fights and the west garden is drunk, picking all the loquats on a tree of gold." Lu You's poem: "I am not afraid of the wind shaking and falling on the branches, I only worry about the birds pecking at the tree." All are masterpieces.

According to Guang Zhi, seedless loquats are called Jiaozi, but if you want to make every loquat seedless, you can also do it manually, that is, when the loquat starts to flower, remove its flower whiskers. It is said that Zhu Zhuzhai of Xiushui and a Taoist priest did this, and there was a good story: "A Taoist priest watched that there were two loquat trees, and every time they ripened, he had to treat Zhu Zhuzhai, and they were all seedless when they were peeled and eaten. During the questioning, he did not answer. Zhu Zhuzhai loved steamed pork, so he bought meat and steamed it until it was cooked, and then invited him to come, ordering the maid to buy _ shoulders from outside. Therefore, the Taoist priest saw it, and he took it out to serve the guest in less than a moment. The Taoist priest was surprised at how fast it was, and it was already cooked through. Suddenly, Zhu Zhuzhai asked about the method of quick ripening, and Zhai said: "I want to exchange it for loquat seeds." The Taoist priest said: "Nothing else, just remove its flower whiskers when it starts to flower." Zhai said: "My meat is nothing else, it was steamed in advance yesterday." After speaking, they laughed together. This is still passed down as a good story.

### Yuan Wei Zhi and Yan Ji Dao

— Qi Ren

Today, there are many bad phenomena of conflicts between the older and younger generations, just like what Mencius said: "The master teaches me with righteousness, but the master has not come from righteousness, which means that the father and son are hurting each other, and it is bad if the father and son hurt each other!" Because of the reason that "if the upper beam is not straight, the lower beam will be crooked", disputes in society and family are increasing day by day.

I once laughed at ancient literati who also had this disease, such as Yuan Wei Zhi to his nephew Shen Yun:

"I grew up in the capital, and I don't have many friends, but I have never known the home of an actor, and I have never watched a lively scene in a noisy place...

Later, when he arrived in Shaanxi, he wrote a poem expressing his ambition, saying that he was "indulgent in life," and even wrote: "...I didn't know I was young, I deeply understood things in wine, I could sing poems that violated the law, and I was particularly proficient in changing the meaning of review, containing words and waiting for the remaining beat, shouting and throwing the plate..." This is almost like being written by two people compared to the words in the letter to his nephew, which can be said to be extremely contradictory! Probably the words of teaching his nephew were feigned and upright, to deceive the child, while the poems eating, drinking, and throwing plates in a prostitute's house...were the real situation. The so-called poem expresses ambition, and words are the voice of the heart, so there is no concealment at all.

This reminds me of some hypocritical Confucians among my predecessors. They said: "When I was young, how did I abide by the rules, not look at what was not proper, not say what was not proper..." etc., but in fact they were all fake. "Evasive words show their poverty," covering up or exaggerating, and as a result, revealing their tails, it becomes even more ugly! But after they become angry in their old age, they are used to saying such things: "Bandits never want their children to be bandits, and opium smokers never want their children to smoke opium." This is called "being thin to oneself and generous to others."

For example, Yuan Wei Zhi, he can proudly say:

"Don't learn my shortcomings, you should learn my advantages, such as my literature, which is enough for you younger generations to learn. If you don't learn my articles but learn my drinking, throwing plates, and some romantic and impulsive behaviors, that's not right!"

Also, Yan Ji Dao, who scolded the most happily, when he was the director of Anhui Xuexiao, he smoked opium heavily, and the students pointed at him. He got angry, and then issued a _ theory saying: "With Ji Dao's knowledge, smoking opium is acceptable, but without Ji Dao's knowledge, smoking opium is not acceptable."

This seems to be a matter of course, and this high theory can be hung at the gate of the country, and no word can be changed. However, this always cannot make the younger generation convinced. Whether it is Yuan Wei Zhi's pretense or Yan Ji Dao's real anger, the result is the same as the next generation looks down on.

"He who teaches by words argues, he who teaches by example follows", from now on, we should still believe in this sentence in order to have the true price of education.

Although Yuan Wei Zhi and Yan Ji Dao are also amazing, but the amazing thing about them is not that they can pretend and be angry.

### Chronicle of a Besieged City

— Qin Shou Ou

"But, you still have to bring some luggage," many people said in unison.

Zhu Zhaonian pointed to the small leather suitcase he was sitting on.

"This one is enough! You guys deal with the rest, bring what you can, and it doesn't matter if you throw away what you can't." He hugged Fei Fei and stood up hurriedly.

Fei Fei also opened her eyes and looked at everyone, appearing quite reluctant.

But as soon as Lao Zhu stood up, several more careful companions discovered a difficulty. They were worried that he would not be able to carry Fei Fei in one hand and the suitcase in the other for a long journey. And Lao Zhu had been holding him like this, and the sick Fei Fei was also very tired. After they said this, Zhu Zhaonian himself also thought of it. After discussion, the final decision was to let him carry Fei Fei on his back. At that time, a female member of the group took off a square cloth bag with a very solid texture without thinking, and turned it into a _ shape, tying Fei Fei to Lao Zhu's back, so Fei Fei didn't necessarily need to hold on to Lao Zhu's shoulders, and Lao Zhu's hands could also be free.

"Is it comfortable, Fei Fei?" Everyone asked Fei Fei.

Her reply was a silent smile; after this exhausting work, her spirit seemed to be refreshed. "Fei Fei, give me the rabbit, it's tiring to hold it. Uncle Zhu will put it in the suitcase for you, okay?" Lao Zhu turned his head and said.

"No, Fei Fei wants to hold it, you will lose it if you give it to you." She replied very naively: "If it is really lost, what will you give to my younger brother?"

This made Lao Zhu and others laugh.

"Well, then," Lao Zhu nodded to the many companions around him one by one. "If you think our troupe is still unwilling to disband and still wants to maintain it, I suggest that you should first elect a responsible person so that everything will not be chaotic."

Everyone felt that it was right, but they couldn't think of who should be elected for a while.

"In my opinion, Lao Ying is the most suitable person!" Zhu Zhaonian pointed to the cripple and said: "He is very cautious and older than you guys, ......"

Before he could finish speaking, the people around him clapped their hands.
