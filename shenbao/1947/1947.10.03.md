Editorial

### Can Japan's Industrial Level Be Allowed to Rise Further?

Mr. Sheba, the Chairman of the Fourth Committee on Japan and the US representative, recently reported on the current state of Japan's industrial production. He believes that the Far Eastern Commission's resolution that Japan's post-war economy should maintain the level it had between 1930 and 1934 is too strict and insufficient to supply Japan's peacetime needs, and seems to advocate for further increases. After seeing this news report, we wonder what the intentions of some American politicians and economists are. A few days ago, we received the September issue of "American Magazine," which contained an article by Mr. Stryker, an advisor on reparations issues for the US Army Department, entitled "Revenge is Waste," which fundamentally opposes the United Nations' demand for reparations from Japan and advocates overturning the resolution passed by the Far Eastern Commission, so as to allow Japan to retain a higher industrial level. This newspaper already wrote an article on the 29th of last month to refute it. However, Mr. Stryker's absurd arguments do represent the views of some American politicians and economists, and Mr. Sheba is one of them.

Mr. Sheba's report on the current state of Japanese industry can be summarized into the following four points: The level of Japanese industry determined by the Far Eastern Commission is inevitably too strict and insufficient to supply Japan's peacetime needs; Since its surrender, Japan has achieved very substantial recovery in industry, and this autumn's production volume has reached 45% of the level between 1930 and 1934; Concluding a peace treaty with Japan and restoring Japan's foreign trade is the only way to make Japan's economic recovery optimistic; It is expected that in the coming year, Japan will make even better progress in obtaining the essential industrial raw materials it needs. Judging only from Mr. Sheba's report, one can see the rapid speed of Japan's industrial recovery and the excessive leniency of the American attitude towards Japan. It not only poses a great threat to China, as General Shang Zhen, the head of our delegation, said: "When building the Japanese economy, precautions must be taken to prevent the recurrence of 'past unsatisfactory situations,' and the Allied nations should not forget the reconstruction work of China and the countries of the Western Pacific that were destroyed by Japan when assisting Japan in restoring its industry." Even the British representative felt uneasy after hearing Mr. Sheba's report, so Mr. also said: "Although the Japanese economy has not yet recovered to the extent that it threatens peace, it is necessary to conduct safety inspections of the development of the Japanese economy."

The issue of Japan's industrial level not only involves the core issue of the peace treaty with Japan—the issue of Japanese reparations—but also concerns China's security. In recent days, all sectors have been discussing the issue of the peace treaty with Japan, and all have emphasized the issue of Japan's post-war industrial level. President Truman's reparations commissioner, Mr. Pauley, personally went to Japan last year to conduct an on-the-spot investigation of the country's industrial and commercial economy. After returning to the country, he submitted a report to the President, advocating that Japan's future industrial level should be based on the standard of 1928. However, after research by the US State Department, it was believed that Mr. Pauley's plan would reduce the living standards of the Japanese people, so it was revised to relax the standards and advocate for Japan's industrial level to be restored to the level of 1932. Later, the Far Eastern Commission held repeated meetings to discuss this issue and decided that Japan's future industrial level should be based on the standard between 1930 and 1934. But recently, some American politicians and economists believe that the level determined by the Far Eastern Commission is inevitably too strict and insufficient to supply Japan's peacetime needs. Mr. Stryker and Mr. Sheba are representatives of these people. What exactly are their intentions? It is really puzzling!

China's basic attitude towards Japan has been repeatedly expressed by our Foreign Affairs Bureau, adhering to an attitude of generosity and never adopting a policy of revenge towards Japan. However, generosity must have its limits. We know that if a policy of revenge is adopted towards a defeated country, the hatred between nations will deepen, which will inevitably arouse resentment among the people of the defeated country. The rise of Nazi Germany, which eventually led to World War II, is a good example. However, if we overcorrect and are unilaterally generous to a defeated country, even to the point of indulgence, allowing it to recover rapidly and maintain its potential for aggression, the consequences will be endless. As the saying goes, "Indulgence breeds evil." The Allied authorities must pay attention to this, especially since Japan is adopting the method of "Goujian serving Wu" in our history towards the United States, being outwardly obedient but inwardly determined to endure hardship and seek revenge at all times. Therefore, we have repeatedly called on the American government and the public to pay special attention to Japan and should be especially vigilant. In all fairness, Commissioner Pauley's plan to advocate for the standard of 1928 is the most fair. The Far Eastern Commission's decision is already inevitably too high. How can it be allowed to rise further? Mr. Hou Debang, General Manager of Tianjin Yongli Chemical Industry Company, spent two months in Japan this summer and witnessed the rapid recovery of Japan. Filled with emotion, he recently gave a speech to the press, saying: "With the support of the US military, Japanese industry has gradually recovered to its pre-war level. The Pauley Plan has been abandoned, and Mr. Stryker's generous anti-reparations theory has given Japan even greater encouragement."

In short, what are the intentions of Mr. Stryker and Mr. Sheba? It is certainly not to deal with China, but it has other effects, but the consequences it creates are enough to threaten China's security. Therefore, we must criticize such absurdities that could endanger peace in the Far East!

### Annual Meeting of Engineers

Director Zhang's Speech

Director Zhang said in his speech: The annual meeting of the Chinese Institute of Engineers was previously held in Rong and Yu during the war and made considerable achievements in the construction of Sichuan Province, giving Sichuan Province a foundation for construction. During the War of Resistance, it was stated in the Outline for Resistance and National Reconstruction that the War of Resistance was to eliminate obstacles to construction, and the importance of construction can be seen. After the general mobilization order was issued this year, I had a speech explaining that the current struggle is between the forces of destruction and construction. Although our country has abolished the unequal treaties of the past century, if we want to achieve true independence and freedom, we must strive for it through construction. We should all concentrate our efforts on construction in order to obtain the true meaning of independence and freedom. Mr. Zhang then reported on his impressions of his recent inspection in Northeast China and North China, and emphasized the importance of "talent populating the border regions," saying: During this trip to the recovered areas, I visited all the factories worth seeing, such as the Anshan Iron and Steel Plant and the Xiaofengman Hydropower Plant, to investigate. According to the investigation, when the Japanese operated the mines before the end of the War of Resistance, coal production was estimated at 27 million tons in the Northeast and 14 million tons in North China, totaling more than 40 million tons. This year's production is 25 million tons. It is hoped that it can be restored to 30 million tons. Secondly, iron ore production is 2 million tons in the Northeast and 680,000 tons in North China, steel production is 1.8 million tons in the Northeast and 130,000 tons in North China, and electricity production is 1.8 million kilowatts in the Northeast and 150,000 kilowatts in North China. These are all major resources for industrial construction. Our engineers have great foresight and the hard work of the engineering personnel is extremely admirable. In particular, the heroic spirit of engineers Zhang Xinfu, Yu Zailin, and the recent deaths of 83 engineers in the recent battle are all extremely admirable. Today, we should strengthen the defense of Northeast China and North China. At the same time, I propose the idea of "talent populating the border regions," which is urgently needed at present. Because if we want to talk about construction, the first is construction, and the second is talent. China's resources include coal in the Northeast and oil in the West and North. Even looking at the entire Southeast Asia, its quality and quantity of coal cannot exceed our Datong Coal Mine. Datong's coal is as good as the coal in English Welsh. We need to strengthen protection and also need people to manage it. We hope that engineers can study how to strengthen management, and we hope that everyone can go to the border areas for inspection in order to develop resources. On the day of the annual meeting of the Chinese Institute of Engineers, I would like to offer the four characters "talent populating the border regions" to everyone.

Mr. Bai Chongxi's Speech

Mr. Bai Chongxi briefly discussed the relationship between engineering and national defense. He said: During the eight years of the War of Resistance, engineering construction greatly helped national defense. For example, the completion of the Xiang-Gui Railway greatly assisted in the important task of advancing the war. Later, the Gui-Qian Railway and the Shan-Gan Railway were all important strategic projects. In terms of resources, the Yumen Oil Mine in Gansu and the alcohol factories established everywhere were the assistance of our engineering community to the development of such resources, so that the five million troops could fight a long-term war in the inconvenient areas of the southwest. Secondly, Minister Bai analyzed international wars, saying: The First World War was still a positional war, while the Second World War was a victory for scientific warfare, because scientific inventions such as radar, rocket launchers, and atomic bombs were able to end the war. Now, the Ministry of National Defense has a National Defense Science Committee for this purpose, hoping to establish close contact with the engineering community, while researching and improving. Therefore, our engineering construction plan should be coordinated with the construction of national defense science.

Mr. Weng Wenhao's Speech

Mr. Weng Wenhao briefly stated: We claim to build the country on agriculture, but we are short of 30 million dan of grain every year. We want to be scientific, but during the War of Resistance, we could still manufacture 1,500-kilowatt generators, but after the victory, we could no longer manufacture them. The reason is that everyone thought that they should be comfortable after the victory and did not work hard. Therefore, I believe that engineers should have three standards: Construction, Advancement, and Meaningful planned work. We must defeat those who hinder national construction and build the country. We must fully do meaningful and planned work.

Mr. Chen Lifu's Speech

Mr. Chen Lifu replied: If the government has a more complete plan, then engineers will make a greater contribution. For example, at the beginning of the War of Resistance, engineers participated in the construction of military positions, and their bravery was no less than that of armed soldiers. But what we hope for is a more concrete plan. Engineers are not afraid of death. In the future, military affairs and engineering will be inseparable. We must give engineers the opportunity to work and die for the country. Secondly, Mr. Chen believes that the current economic policy and financial policy cannot be coordinated, and the financial policy is running counter to the goal of increasing industrial production. Therefore, we also hope that those responsible for the economy must study how to develop industry under very reasonable conditions. Finally, he hopes that the education sector can especially seek more equipment for engineering education.

Telegram to the Chairman

Respectful telegram to the Chairman: To Chairman Chiang: Your brilliant decision-making and leadership in the War of Resistance eventually led to victory, which is respected by the world. As you are about to devote yourself to peace, implement constitutional government, and return power to the people, it is the opening of the 14th annual meeting of this association, bringing together engineers from all over the country. All of us will fulfill our duties to the best of our ability, and strive to cooperate with national defense and people's livelihood, in order to live up to your intention of peace and national construction. We respectfully send this telegram and ask for your consideration. The Chinese Institute of Engineers and the Joint Annual Meeting of Various Specialized Engineering Societies kowtow.

Wang Ni Mo's Retrial (Continued from Page 1) Wang Ni's answer stated that his involvement was initially motivated by the need to support a family of nine, so he took the position of professor at the puppet Normal College. Later, Tang Erhe (then Educational Supervisor) and Japanese Major Narita (Japanese Special Agency Education Director) persuaded and coerced him into reluctantly taking the position of president of the Normal College. It was not until the end of 1943 that he began serving as a political commissioner and educational supervisor. The process was due to the promotion of colleagues in the Beijing cultural and educational circles. Initially, Chang Zhun, Zhang Dongsun, Tang Erhe, and others met at Tang Zhiming's residence. Before taking office, he asked Zhang and others how to preserve the vitality of education in North China. He claimed that his acceptance of the puppet position was purely due to Zhang and others' persuasion. He presented Zhang Dongsun's letter of proof in court, stating that he had consulted Wang, but Zhang had "not replied due to a bad mood." Zhang's letter proved that Wang was trying to preserve culture and education. Wang Ni also expressed with emotion that he was subjected to enemy bullying, "which is difficult to describe in one word." The court then asked why he did it again after suffering losses. As a university professor, he should understand reason, but he did not know that under Japanese control, it was impossible to have the freedom to do things as he pleased and preserve Chinese culture. His understanding was not clear, which was too difficult to explain. Wang Ni repeatedly said yes. Finally, he was asked about the Qinghua University's accumulated books and materials being sold as waste paper by the Education Directorate. Wang Ni claimed that he was negligent beforehand and had tried his best to remedy it afterward. The sold items were old files from the Beijing government, with no books at all. The interrogation ended at 4:30 PM. Wang Ni did not present any new evidence, but only asked for fewer trials and a quick conclusion to the case, as he was a poor scholar who could not afford the transportation costs. After the clerk Xu Xiaogong read the court record, the court was adjourned, and Wang Ni was returned to custody.

### Pan Ni Yu's Verdict Not Announced Yesterday: More Evidence of Guilt Discovered, Decision to Investigate Further

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 2nd] The case of the major traitor Pan Ni Yu in North China was originally scheduled to be announced on the morning of the 2nd. However, the Capital High Court recently obtained new evidence of guilt and decided to reinvestigate. At 4:00 PM, Presiding Judge Jin Shiyue, Judges Wang Hongquan, Liu Cai, and Clerk Sha Rongsheng took the stand and brought in Pan Ni. They announced the ruling to "reopen the debate" in court, stating that there was still some evidence to be investigated. After the investigation is completed, the case will be retried. Then the court adjourned, and Pan Ni was greatly disturbed.

### Pu Yi's Brother's Scandal: Lawsuit Unresolved After Ten Years, First Wife Resues, Hearing in Ping

[Shenzhou News Agency, Beiping, 2nd] Pu Guang, the brother of the puppet Manchukuo emperor Pu Yi, caused his first wife, Jin Cunyin, to be dissatisfied after marrying Kunling Xue Yanqin, resulting in a lawsuit that has lasted for more than ten years. This year, Jin sued again in the Beiping District Court, seeking alimony. After the District Court accepted the case, it summoned Pu Guang, but he did not appear. The hearing is scheduled for the 3rd. If he fails to appear again, his property will be seized according to the plaintiff's request.

### If the Democratic League Does Not Change Its Style, the Government Will Take Action

[Our Dispatch] Sources say that the government spokesman's accusations against the Democratic League are all based on facts. Therefore, if the Democratic League does not change its style, the government will take action in the near future. The Democratic League has assisted the Communist bandits in intelligence work. Before and after the fifth offensive of the Northeast Communist Army, it received the cooperation of members of the Democratic League in this regard. For the sake of its own dignity, the government cannot tolerate this for long. As for the government's future measures, it may be to concentrate all members of the Democratic League in government areas and send them to the communist areas.

### Yangtze River Steamer Fares Increased by 45 Percent

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 2nd] The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, Sanbei, and Minsheng Yangtze River steamer companies will uniformly increase fares by 45 percent starting from the 3rd.

Li Hua and other supervisory officials were also sent to various places to organize and train civilian forces, making Sichuan's defense extremely solid.

### Communist Bandits Attempt to Make Trouble in Nanan Market, Huazhou County, Southern Guangdong, but Fail

[Our Guangzhou Dispatch, 2nd] According to the Daguan Daily Zhanjiang report, more than 3,000 Communist bandits under Tang Caiyou gathered in Nanan Market (under the jurisdiction of Huazhou County) on September 20th, attempting to cause trouble. The garrison troops opened fire and suppressed them. After a fierce battle, more than 2,000 bandits were killed or wounded, and only a few hundred escaped.

### Sino-Australian Trade Continues to Increase

[Central News Agency, Canberra, 2nd] Since the end of the Pacific War, Sino-Australian trade has continued to increase. According to Australian official statistics, Australian imports from China reached 1,045,000 pounds last year, and Australian exports to China reached 4,844,000 pounds. Exports exceeded imports by 3,799,000 pounds. In 1946, Chinese imports to Australia were only 83,000 pounds, and Australian exports to China were only 700,800 pounds.

### School Principals Are Not Officials and Do Not Need to Resign to Run for Election: Women's Groups in Various Places Have This Request

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 2nd] Zhai Jingmin, the executive director of the National Professional Women's Election Office, recently answered reporters' questions regarding election issues:

Q: The number of seats for industrial and commercial groups has been approved by the Legislative Yuan. Has the detailed distribution method been decided?

A: It is awaiting the official announcement from the National Government.

Q: Are school principals regarded as officials? Should they resign before running for the National Assembly or the Legislative Yuan?

A: The General Office has explained this matter. All civil servants appointed by the government equivalent to or above the rank of entrusted appointment, and military officers equivalent to or above the rank of lieutenant, are regarded as officials. If they participate in local National Assembly or Legislative Yuan elections, they should resign. However, responsible persons from women's groups in various places have repeatedly requested that school principals are not appointed in accordance with the civil service regulations, and that when they concurrently serve as provincial and county councilors, they have been expressly exempted from the restriction that "officials may not concurrently serve as provincial and county councilors." We have now asked the General Office to reconsider it.

### Land Administration Review Meeting Passes: Tanggu New Port Assigned to Tianjin City

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 2nd] The Land Administration Review Meeting held its third general meeting this morning, chaired by Li Jingzhai.

### Overseas Chinese in Nanyang Recovering Rapidly: Remittances from Singapore and Other Places Increase, Says Governor of Guangdong Provincial Bank After Returning from Inspection

[Our Guangzhou Dispatch, 2nd] Liu Zuoren, the governor of Guangdong Provincial Bank, recently returned from an inspection of various places in Nanyang. According to him, although overseas Chinese in Nanyang suffered greatly from enemy devastation during the war, their recovery after the war has been extremely rapid. However, the main local products such as rubber and tin have not fully resumed production, and the unrest in the Dutch East Indies and Vietnam has prevented them from recovering to their pre-war prosperity for the time being. Singapore has not been turned into a war zone, and its economic situation can still maintain its old appearance, but its currency value is also extremely low. Overseas Chinese in Singapore and other places have a deep hope for the motherland, and remittances are rapidly increasing. They all hope that the motherland will be stable soon so that they can return home to invest and start industries. Overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies suffered greatly from the maltreatment of the local people during the recent war, with more than 100,000 victims, and they are looking forward to the motherland's rescue day and night.

### Hebei Plans a Grain Storage and Disaster Prevention Program

### Requisitioning Enemy and Puppet Properties in Nanjing and Shanghai: Allocating Them as Dormitories for Public School and Government Personnel; Representatives from Various Organizations Discussing the Compensation of Public School and Government Personnel

(Continued from the first page) During today's meeting, Liu Zhiping, Wu [name missing in original] Xu, Chen Zifeng and others spoke separately. There were different views on the level of the basic salary. Some people thought 15 [currency unit missing in original] was sufficient, while others thought 30 [currency unit missing in original] was too little.

Supervisory Committee member Wang Guanwu spoke, emphasizing that superiors and subordinates should share hardships together and that there should be no more disparities and injustices. He stated sorrowfully that at present, some officials and important figures have their food, lodging, and servants provided by the government. The enjoyment of one person is at least equivalent to that of many civil servants. Often, a minister occupies ten rooms, while junior staff cannot even find one room. This kind of disregard for subordinates and unequal phenomenon should be corrected. Regarding the entire compensation issue, he believes that in addition to salary increases, the government should do its best to provide in-kind allocations, accommodation, subsidies for [items missing in original] and education expenses. The aim should not be [missing in original], but rather universality, so that everyone can benefit. Regarding accommodation, he also put forward a strong suggestion, advocating the requisition of enemy and puppet properties and the equal distribution to civil servants of various organizations. Wang recently returned from investigating enemy and puppet properties and stated that in Shanghai alone, there are over 3,300 enemy and puppet properties, all occupied by influential figures, which should be requisitioned.

Liu [name missing in original] does not believe that the national treasury has no funds to build dormitories for public school and government personnel. He cited a shocking fact: a certain important figure recently celebrated his birthday, and the Four Banks and Two Bureaus were ordered to give gifts of 60 million [currency unit missing in original] each. Six times six is thirty-six, and with a wave of the hand, 360 million [currency unit missing in original] was obtained. Money is available for private gifts, but not for building dormitories for public school and government personnel. This statement should convince everyone.

Cheng Yuan [name missing in original] advocated starting with salary increases. He believes that even if everyone's salary is doubled, the national treasury has ample capacity to bear it. The current national financial difficulties are mainly due to corruption in the tax system, with tax revenues being pocketed by those who handle them. If the government can resolutely rectify tax collection, then the increased income can be used to adjust the compensation of civil servants and will definitely not lead to financial collapse. The original proposer, Liu Zhiping, put forward the following points: 1. Support the method proposed by the Supervisory Yuan of using 30 [currency unit missing in original] as the base salary and issuing it according to the cost of living index. 2. The adjustment of compensation should not be limited to Nanjing and Shanghai but should be extended to the whole country. 3. Building loans that have not been issued should be recovered, and the use of those that have been issued should be thoroughly investigated.

After the attendees finished speaking, they discussed each item individually. Regarding the salary adjustment method, everyone agreed to adopt the method proposed by the Supervisory Yuan of using 30 [currency unit missing in original] as the base salary. This 30 [currency unit missing in original] is calculated according to the cost of living index. For amounts above 30 [currency unit missing in original], the method proposed by Chen Lifu will be used, which is approximately 5,000 times the current standard.

Regarding the in-kind allocation method, most people agreed that it should be continued and expanded to the whole country. As for the types of items, they should still be rice, oil, salt, sugar, coal, and cloth, among other seven types. Cheng Yuan [name missing in original] raised the issue of imperfections in the past in-kind allocation methods, such as insufficient distribution of oil and coal briquettes, and some bureaucratic capitalists taking the opportunity to make a fortune. Therefore, he advocated only providing rice, coal, and cloth.

Regarding the dormitory issue, the attendees generally agreed that the government should build more dormitories for public school and government personnel. The suggestion made by Wang Guanwu to requisition enemy and puppet properties in Nanjing and Shanghai and distribute them equally to civil servants of various organizations was passed without objection. Chen Zifeng and others advocated recovering building loans to build houses and punishing those with money and houses who borrow again with the crime of corruption. Liu [name missing in original] also agreed, while She Guangxun believed that those who borrowed legally in the past should not be held accountable, and future loans should be stopped.

Regarding children's education and medical expenses, the attendees generally agreed that they should be provided free of charge. Du Guangxun also cited the fact that the cost of his children's illness consumed several months of his salary. Another attendee also pointed out that tuition fees for children entering school accounted for the entirety of one month's income. Everyone agreed that the government should establish more schools and hospitals.

### The Security Council Mediates International Disputes: Major Powers Should Abandon the Right of Veto; China Makes a Formal Proposal to the General Assembly; Jiang Tingfu Declares Support for the U.S. Position on the Greek Issue

[United Press, New York, Second Day [of Month Missing]]: China today formally proposed to the United Nations General Assembly that the five permanent members of the Security Council should automatically abandon their right of veto when mediating international disputes. However, it does not advocate amending the UN Charter but only requests to clarify the nature of the automatic abandonment of the veto. Diplomatic circles are surprised by this move, given that the Chinese government recently issued a statement advocating for the retention of the veto.

[Central News Agency, New York, First Day [of Month Missing]]: Chinese representative Jiang Tingfu this morning explained China's attitude towards the Greek issue at the Political and Security Committee of the General Assembly. Jiang stated that the Chinese delegation supports the proposal made by the United States regarding the Balkan issue. Although China is far from Greece and has no direct material relationship in Southeast Europe, we are still concerned about the situation in Greece because the various principles involved in the Greek issue are extremely important to world peace and security. According to the U.S. proposal, the General Assembly should declare that Albania, Bulgaria, and Yugoslavia are guilty of aggression against Greece and send a United Nations commission to the Balkans to restore peace to the Greek border. Jiang also stated that some theories argue that the Greek issue stems from British and American aid to Greece. However, neither the UN Charter nor international law prohibits a government from aiding another government or accepting aid from another government. Therefore, other governments have no legal reason to be dissatisfied with Greece's acceptance of British and American aid. We cannot accept the view expressed in some theories that because the United States and Britain aided Greece, Greece's neighboring countries can use force to assist the opposition factions in Greece. If we recognize this theory, it will lead to anarchy. This General Assembly should declare to the world that we abide by the universally recognized principles of international law, and one of the most important aspects is that no country can assist or instigate rebellion within other countries.

### Six Countries Elected as Members of the Economic and Social Council, Including the UK and the Soviet Union; The Security Council Trusteeship Council Election of Members Reaches a Stalemate

[Central News Agency, Lake Success, First Day [of Month Missing]]: The United Nations General Assembly elected members to the Economic and Social Council this morning. The United Kingdom and the Soviet Union were re-elected, and Brazil, Denmark, Australia, and Poland were also elected. These six countries will serve as members for two years starting from January 1 next year.

### Authorities Agree on Countermeasures for the Streetcar Workers' Strike: All Must Return to Work Today, Otherwise Unconditional Dismissal; Replacement Workers Are Ready and Can be Deployed Immediately

[Reported by this newspaper] The municipal authorities convened an important meeting at the Social Affairs Bureau conference room at 4 p.m. yesterday to handle the French streetcar workers' strike. Those in attendance included Mayor Wu, Social Affairs Bureau Director Wu Kaixian, Public Works Bureau Director Zhao Zengjue, Workers' Welfare Committee Director Lu Jingshi, Police Bureau Director Yu Shuping, General Labor Union Chairman Shui Xiangyun, and Social Affairs Bureau Labor Division Director Shen Ding. The French director and personnel manager of the French water and electricity company also attended. The meeting ended at 5:45 p.m. After the meeting, Mayor Wu and Director Wu met with reporters. Mayor Wu said: The French streetcar workers' strike has been dragging on for several days. Most well-intentioned workers have been unable to return to work due to external threats. Considering the public interest, the authorities cannot allow public transportation to remain suspended for so long. Therefore, workers have been notified that if they do not return to work, they will be unconditionally dismissed. The government has made all preparations, and public buses can be driven by soldiers from the driving corps, and streetcars can be operated by unemployed workers. However, the workers are still delaying their return to work. Therefore, the company issued a notice tonight (referring to last night) requiring all workers to return to work by the 3rd, otherwise they will be unconditionally dismissed. From the 4th, the Social Affairs Bureau will immediately deploy the workers who are ready and begin hiring new workers. The government is taking this measure not because it is being too harsh on the workers, but because they have been warned repeatedly and still refuse to return to work. The situation cannot be delayed any longer, and for the sake of the public interest, this is the only way. Mayor Wu continued that the list of personnel to be arrested has already been announced. This list was found at the Futong Printing Company. Those who are at large have been instructed to have each Baojia try to collect drawings of photographic images and to arrest them. Workers who are not on the announced list should not believe rumors. Any well-intentioned worker who is threatened by trouble-makers can report to the police station, and the municipal government has ordered all police stations to provide protection. Currently, trouble-makers are using a "bitter meat" strategy, using the families of arrested workers to cry and wail at the factory to prevent workers from going to work. If these family members have grievances, they can go to the Social Affairs Bureau or the municipal government to appeal and explain. In the future, any similar crying and obstruction will be regarded as disruptive behavior and will be subject to arrest. The government will resolutely protect well-intentioned workers, but workers who are not on the arrest list but collude with those on the arrest list will also be severely punished. Mayor Wu finally hoped that the well-intentioned workers of the French streetcar company would not be afraid of threats and return to work today, and stated that any threats from trouble-makers in Shanghai can be suppressed.

Mounted Police to Protect Returning Workers

Director Wu continued to supplement the report, saying that the government has made the greatest determination and dispatched all mounted patrols, police, and plainclothes police to protect returning workers and their families, so that they can work with peace of mind. Any returning worker or their family who is threatened can report to the police station at any time, and the authorities will severely punish the threatening personnel. Director Wu also stated that if French streetcar workers return to work after today's deadline, they will be hired as new workers, and all past years of service will not be counted.

Director Wu also told reporters that Zhu Junxin and 15 others who were previously dismissed by the Social Affairs Bureau from the French streetcar company are all on the wanted list.

### Workers Hold General Meeting, Majority Willing to Return to Work, Abandoned After Dispersing From the Factory Due to Underhanded Tactics, Leaflet Distributors Arrested

[Reported by this newspaper] French streetcars and buses did not leave the factory yesterday morning, but partially resumed work in the afternoon, with more than 20 vehicles running. Employees had sent representatives to see Social Affairs Bureau Director Wu the night before, saying that they could formally return to work yesterday, but hoped that the drivers sent out by the Social Affairs Bureau would no longer work, otherwise they feared that workers would misunderstand that their jobs were being taken and be unable to return to work. Director Wu said that if the employees could return to work, the drivers sent out could wait a while, and to avoid stimulating the original workers, he immediately ordered the drivers sent out not to enter the car factory, but to wait elsewhere. At 10 a.m. yesterday, employees held a general meeting in the factory, attended by more than 400 people. Some employees still demanded the release of the arrested workers. However, under persuasion, the majority of the workers present said they would be willing to return to work and agreed to return to work in the afternoon after returning home to put on their work clothes. The factory immediately dispatched a fixed-route trolleybus, a streetcar, and a bus at 10:30 a.m. to transport the returning workers. After the meeting, as the workers left the factory, a track worker numbered 45 distributed "Letter to the People of Shanghai" from the "Strike Committee of the French Streetcar Company of the Shanghai Electric Power Company" and "Letter to Members" from the French Electric Power Union near the post office on Jianguo East Road, south of the car factory. Military police nearby discovered this and arrested him. As a result, the workers who were scheduled to return to work at the factory in the afternoon abandoned their plans. Therefore, the Social Affairs Bureau still dispatched the workers who were prepared in the afternoon to drive out of the factory to maintain transportation. Each vehicle had two armed policemen accompanying it for protection, and the fare, regardless of distance, was still 1,000 yuan across the board.

### Company Issues Notice Sent Out Late at Night

The power outage in some areas of Nanshi and the former French Concession the night before was due to a sudden decrease in the power plant's electricity generation, and the company automatically shut down the current to the aforementioned areas. Rumors that the power lines were destroyed were inaccurate. It has also been learned that a power supply shed at the intersection of Pengpu Road and Yulin Road was destroyed yesterday, but was quickly repaired. The Yulin Road Police Station and the Garrison Headquarters have dispatched additional police officers to protect it and strictly investigate traitors who attempt to destroy electricity.

Furthermore, the news that a typhoon would come to Shanghai on August 29th and 30th was merely a headline created by a reporter to arouse readers' interest.

### Newly Revised Commercial Registration Law, Very Detailed Provisions, Opinions from Xi Yushu, Chen Tingrui, etc.

[Reported by this newspaper] After the key points of the Ministry of Economic Affairs' newly revised draft Commercial Registration Law were published in the newspapers, a reporter specially consulted with accountant Xi Yushu, who gave his opinion, stating: The method adopts a definitional provision for the scope of commerce, instead of an enumeration, which can avoid the problem of leaving out one or two cases. The method requires that registrations other than creation or change should be registered at the same time as creation or change. With such regulations, the nature of the store is easy for the competent authority to investigate, and the public can easily understand. For example, there are more than ten stores in this city that use the Guan Sheng Yuan name, but as far as I know, most of them are agencies, and the outside world is not very clear. Taking this example alone, it can be seen that the registration of managers, agents, partners, etc. is really necessary. Lawyer Chen Tingrui also expressed his opinion, saying that the new law is very detailed in its regulations on various registrations. He also said that China is carrying out large-scale post-war construction, and in principle, it should value foreign technology and capital. However, the psychology of some Chinese people at present is still worried about foreign economic invasion, which is not necessary. After the abolition of consular jurisdiction, if there can be strict commercial management, the tricks of the past will definitely not be seen again today. Passively opposing international economic cooperation is really not a wise move.

[Reported by this newspaper] Regarding the issue of whether criminal acts of substituting for military service should be tried by military law agencies or judicial agencies, the Shanghai Garrison Command received a clear order from the Ministry of National Defense yesterday, stipulating as follows: 1. If substitution for military service is discovered before entering the camp, it should be tried by judicial agencies; 2.

### Qingdao Tries Traitor and Corruption Cases: Diao Fuchi Highly Suspected; Ding Jingchen Bribed 800 Million to Buy Freedom, Falls Back into Confinement

[Qingdao, 28th (Airmail)] Qingdao recently uncovered a case of corruption and malfeasance involving Diao Fuchi, a prosecutor at the Second Branch of the Shandong High Court, and others, involving 800 million yuan. Diao was suspended from his duties and released on bail for investigation on the 8th of this month. It is now reported that he has flown to Jinan to await questioning. The details of the case are as follows:

Ding Jingchen, an economic traitor, was the chairman of the Dabu Bank during the Japanese occupation of Qingdao. The bank was a joint venture between the puppet government and merchants. After the victory, Ding was reported, and the Prosecutor's Office of the Second Branch of the High Court (with Zhu Weiran as the Chief Prosecutor) treated Ding with great deference during the investigation of the case. Each interrogation was conducted by Diao himself at the detention center, without a court hearing. There was early speculation that this was not right. The case dragged on until October of last year, when the Prosecutor's Office concluded that there was insufficient evidence of a crime and decided not to prosecute him, causing a public outcry. Local newspapers reported the case extensively, questioning, "If Ding Jingchen is not a traitor, then who is?"  The Second Branch of the High Court even sent a letter to a newspaper, correcting them, stating that the case was handled entirely according to the law and that evidence should be presented if Ding was considered a traitor, which further fueled dissatisfaction. The City Council then sent a letter to the Ministry of Judicial Administration for clarification. The Ministry confirmed that Dabu Bank was a traitor bank and Ding Jingchen was an economic traitor.

Someone in Jinan also reported Ding Jingchen to the High Court, and the Shandong Provincial Council sent a letter to the High Court requesting the Second Branch of the High Court to thoroughly investigate. The High Court then sent a letter to the Second Branch of the High Court on October 18th stating: "Our Court has accepted a case involving Ding Jingchen and others as traitors. It has been reported that the defendant Ding Jingchen was arrested in Qingdao and that your office has concluded the investigation, deciding not to prosecute him due to insufficient evidence of a crime. We hereby inform you that you should send the entire case file to our court for handling. If the defendant has not been released on bail, please detain him temporarily. If he has been released on bail, please add a significant amount of bail to ensure caution." Unexpectedly, Ding Jingchen left Qingdao on the day the Second Branch of the High Court announced the decision not to prosecute him, flying to Shanghai by plane, his actions swift and surprising. It was later discovered that Ding lived at No. 123 Linsen Middle Road in Shanghai and frequently visited Dr. Yu Caiyao's clinic at No. 94 Zhongzheng North First Road. The Shanghai High Court Prosecutor's Office was telegraphed to bring Ding to justice. On October 26th, the Shanghai office detained Ding and transferred him to Qingdao via Jinan.

During the investigation in Jinan, it was reported that Ding had fully disclosed all the bribery details, stating that the money had been used in all departments of the Second Branch of the High Court in Qingdao, totaling 800 million yuan (at last year's currency value). Ding originally expected to buy his way out of prison, but now that he has still lost his freedom, he feels unwilling. Although the Prosecutor's Office is currently conducting a "secret" investigation, rumors about the case have already spread widely in Qingdao and Jinan.

In June of this year, Hu Ji, the President of the Jinan High Court, reportedly came to Qingdao for this case. On the 8th of this month, the presiding prosecutor, Diao Fuchi, was suspended from his duties and released on bail for investigation. According to the Second Branch of the High Court, Diao has already flown to Jinan. The inside story of this case is complex and involves a wide range of people. (Special Correspondent Shao Shenzhi)

### South Seas Rubber Prices Fall: Overseas Chinese from Hainan Return Home

[Hainan Island, 28th (Airmail)] In recent months, more overseas Chinese have been returning to the island than leaving, especially from the Malay Peninsula. According to officials from the Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau, the reasons are generally due to: 1. Falling rubber prices. Previously, the price of rubber was about $35 per picul, and it even rose to $38 at one point. Due to the brisk sales of rubber, most Chinese workers had jobs and their lives were relatively stable. However, the market price has recently been only about $25 per picul. Rubber factories are finding it difficult to continue due to the low price of goods. Even if they do not go bankrupt, they are laying off large numbers of employees due to cost issues, which is a major reason forcing overseas Chinese to return home. 2. Food problems.  Most of the food for overseas Chinese in Malaya is supplied by the black market. Due to rising black market rice prices, it is difficult for ordinary overseas Chinese to purchase rice, and they are returning home to seek other ways to make a living. Regarding remittance issues, due to the above two reasons, it is also reported that remittances have sharply decreased, which is a serious crisis for overseas Chinese in Malaya. However, according to reporters' inquiries from various sources: although the number of overseas Chinese going to Singapore has decreased, there is an abnormal phenomenon, that is, very few middle-aged and elderly men are going to Singapore, while there are more elderly, weak, women and children, because the entry permits issued by the British government are very strict. As for those going to Burma, after the Burmese representative U Tun Maung arrived in Hainan to handle the repatriation of Hainanese overseas Chinese from Burma, very few new people are going abroad.

### Twelve-Month Pregnancy: A Strange Girl Born

[Hainan Island, 24th (Airmail)] The wife of Liao Fuxing, a villager of Dapo Village in Chengmai County, Hainan Island, gave birth to two children on September 12th, a boy and a girl. The boy was normal, but the girl had fully formed upper and lower teeth in her mouth, with longer front teeth. Her head and face were silvery-white, resembling a grown woman, which was quite eerie. The villagers, upon hearing the news, rushed to see her. The next day, the mother, believing that giving birth to such a daughter was an ominous sign, secretly smothered the girl to death. It is reported that the woman was pregnant for almost twelve months before giving birth.

### Ten Thousand People Compete to Watch the Haining Tide: The Grandeur on the Eve of the Tide God's Birthday is Undiminished

[Haining, 1st (News)] Today is the eve of the 18th day of the eighth lunar month, the "Tide God's Birthday." Reporters and group personnel from various districts and counties went to Babao from Chang'an to watch the tide. The once quiet city of Haining appeared very lively. Pedestrians milled about, and farmers from all over the area gathered. At noon, when the tide came, the Babao Dam was bustling. China Travel Service and the Highway Administration both built viewing platforms, and although the temporary shops were quite simple, their business was a hundred times more prosperous. The crowds were as large as in previous years, but the tide was not as magnificent as it once was. After the tide passed, cars sped along the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway, and pedestrians were as thick as thread, with the "human tide" being more ferocious than the "sea tide." Potalaka devotees have also gathered here and will be "staying overnight" for three days. It is expected that the grand occasion will be even more pronounced tomorrow, which is the "Tide God's Birthday."

[Haining, 1st (News)] The reporter has been fortunate enough to witness the roaring tide on the 18th day of the eighth lunar month on several occasions, which can be considered a highlight of his life. Fearing that he may not be able to see the tide again next year, and to commemorate the magnificent scenes of the past, he would like to borrow a corner of the page to describe the various grand occasions of the Tide God's Birthday.

A telegram from Hangzhou reports that the highest tide will occur on the 18th day of the eighth lunar month, and the grandeur of watching the tide will exceed next year, because the river's course has changed, and the tidal bore in Haining has become smaller. It is predicted that there will be almost no tide to see next year. In fact, according to ancient Chinese customs, our ancestors believed that the tide was highest on the Tide God's Birthday, so they had the idea that the 18th day of the eighth lunar month was the highest tide. The real tide may be around the 18th day of the eighth lunar month, but not necessarily on the 18th day. During the Southern Song Dynasty, the imperial government designated the Tide God's Birthday as the date for reviewing naval forces, which caused the common people to flock to the area, giving the impression of "watching the human tide as much as watching the sea tide."

The scene when the tide comes is roughly as follows: First, there is a sudden rustling sound from afar. At this time, the滔滔 (滔滔 táotāo: torrential) white waves begin to rush over from the horizon, like thousands of white clouds bursting out of the gray clouds. The rustling sound, like white paper tearing, is transformed into a cascading waterfall-like rushing sound in an instant.

In the blink of an eye, the tide seems to be galloping like thousands of horses; followed by the roaring of the tide; like a lion's roar, like a tiger's howl, suddenly turning into the sound of all kinds of beasts roaring together. At this time, the people watching the tide cannot help but feel a sense of awe, standing silently, their eyes all fixed on the oncoming tide. The tide quickly approaches, seemingly carrying the enormous power of overturning mountains and seas, making surging, ever-changing gestures, and immediately emits a deafening roar, shaking the river and the riverbank. White waves, like mythical beasts, roll past in the blink of an eye. The water level on the riverbank immediately rises by seven or eight feet.

Melodious flute sounds come from the nearby temples, and the farmers and fishermen on the riverbank bow down to the tide (which in their minds is the Tide God), and firecrackers are set off all at once on the riverbank.

Fishing boats facing the tide also leap onto the tide, proudly ride with the wind, and speed against the current. This spectacular drama of watching the tide ends in the melodious music. Wu Ling's Old Tales records the Zhejiang tide as follows: "When it first emerges from the sea gate, it is only like a silver thread, but as it gradually approaches, it is like a jade city and a snow ridge, coming from the sky, with a loud sound like thunder, shaking and spurting, swallowing the sky and washing the sun." (Zhou Mi) From this, we can see the heroic posture of the huge Zhejiang tide in the Song Dynasty. Shicui Yutan says: "At first glance, it is a piece of green air, and as it gets closer, it is a vast expanse of white. The edge of the tide sounds like thunder, and its power is like a mountain, roaring and galloping, and in an instant, it reaches the shore, like mountains collapsing and houses falling, leaping three times and settling down, then the entire river is thousands of miles wide, and the sky and the earth are one color." (Wang Keyu) As for the spectacle of the night tide, Sishi Chushang Lu once had a passage: "The wind suddenly turns cold, the sea gate rises, the moonlight and silver waves shimmer, the light swaying like splashing snow, the clouds move like jade banks, the waves roll and crash, and the white silk flutters in the wind, twisting and turning, its momentum is like mountains galloping, making people shudder."

### Autumn Tide High, Seawall Collapses, Yamping Engineering Office Intensively Repairing

[Our Correspondent in Pinghu, 1st] On the eve of the autumn tide, frequent reports came from seawall patrols. The Haiyan-Pinghu section of the Yamping area, under the impact of the Zhapu estuary, suffered frequent collapses. The entire stone seawall from "Wang" to "Ming," numbered 48, was completely destroyed, with seawater rushing into the breach, relying entirely on the earthen road embankment for protection. From Haiyan Nantan to the Fifth Regiment, the base of the stone seawall in front of the Chi Hai Temple was severely damaged. The entire stone seawall from "Zi" to "Lin," numbered 16, collapsed. From Zhapu to Jinsiniang Bridge, near Dushan, one section of the stone seawall collapsed, with the attached earth sinking. From Guandi Temple to Dengya Bridge, Luotangtou, the base of the original gap was hollow, and the entire "Duan" numbered section was tilted outward for hundreds of meters. The Yamping Engineering Office is currently working intensively to repair it, hoping to protect the harvest of crops along the seawall.

### Strange Conscription Event in the Fifth District of Xibei: Guidance Society Runner Introduces Volunteers, Uses Hard Wooden Pole to Beat Village Head

Yesterday's Match

Yesterday's match between Tao and McLagan progressed faster than expected. McLagan reversed his fierce style of the previous days and became a docile lamb. He was not rushing to hit the ball, and frequently hit the net or out of bounds. The key reason was that the ground was loose after the rain, and the ball's bounce was weaker, so his signature forehand could not be used. In addition, he lacked experience and could not get to the net, leading to a complete failure. Tao won all six games in the first set, and lost one game each in the second and third sets, taking only three quarters of an hour.

### Seven Chinese Teams Participate in Competition - Hong Kong Football League Opens - South China Suffers Heavy Defeat Early, Kitchee Wins Over Bus Team - Chinese Team Victorious, Eastern and Guanghua Teams Defeated

[Our Hong Kong Dispatch] The autumn is crisp and refreshing, and it is the football season. The Hong Kong 1947-48 football league opened after the Wooden Shield competition. Fifteen teams in Group A are participating in the championship this season, with Chinese teams accounting for seven: Star Island, Kitchee, Bus Team, Eastern, South China, Guanghua, and Chinese Team. Group B is divided into two groups for mixed battles. There are also two more stadiums than last year, including the South China Association, Naval Stadium, Hong Kong Club, and the newly opened Army Stadium in Hong Kong, and a Police Stadium in Kowloon.

Strength Observation

After the weekend's performance, the strength of each team has been revealed. The strongest Western team is Devan Army, followed by Inness and the Artillery. As for the Chinese teams, Star Island has not returned from its expedition. Although the South China team has returned triumphantly with its full force, it has been unable to form a team due to player treatment issues, so most of the good players have not yet appeared on the field, and it seems that there will be major changes in the team formation. The league is a round-robin system, and the competition will be fierce in the future.

Kitchee's First Victory

On Saturday, the 27th, the league opened, with four games in Group A. The most important battle was between two newly promoted Chinese teams in Group A. Kitchee fought the Bus team at the Police Stadium. The Bus team had four national players, Li Tiansheng, Mai Shaohan, Tan Jiangbai, and Zhuo Shijin, while Kitchee was based on last year's Star Island B team, supplemented by Guo Yingqi, Liu, and Cai.

Kitchee Team

Zhang Guan Yu

Hui Zhongyun Zheng Yingquan

Tan Zhenhui Shan Yousheng Liu Mo Cai

Huang Jingcong Guo Yingqi Li Bingzhao Tan Huanzhang Deng Guangsen

Bus Team

Sun Binan

Li Tiansheng Mai Shaohan

Tan Jiajun Deng Xuanjie Deng Sen

Zhong Jingsheng Zhuo Shijin Tan Jiangbai Zhang Songgen Qian Chiihui

Fifteen minutes after the start of the war, the bus was still able to hold on, but before the dust, Kitchee received a remote lead with a score of 3-0. After changing defense, Guo Yingqi scored a penalty, 4-0. The bus team finally broke the egg with a long shot from Tan Jiangbai. In the end, Kitchee's Deng Guangsen scored, ending the game with a score of 5-1.

South China's Crushing Defeat

South China fought Inness at the Naval Stadium. Because the South China team could not form a team, they hastily went into battle and suffered a crushing defeat of 6-1, the most disastrous defeat in South China's history.

In the other two Western team matches, the artillery team won against the navy with six goals, and the Hong Kong club defeated the police with a score of 4-1.

On Sunday the 28th, Star Island was on a bye, with three games in Group A. Three Chinese teams played at the same time:

Eastern Team Defeated

The Eastern team competed against St. Joseph at the Hong Kong Club Stadium. The strengths of the two sides were at the same level, and the Eastern team finally lost a penalty, with a score of 4-3. The Eastern team lost due to insufficient morale, coupled with goalkeeper Liang Dingtang, who was restless and ruined the big event.

At the Army Stadium, the strongest Western team, Devan, faced the weakest Chinese team, Guanghua, which was naturally one-sided, with Guanghua losing 10-1.

Chinese Team Victorious

At the Police Stadium in Kowloon, the Chinese team, which had just won the Golden Shield championship, played against the Air Force. The Chinese team, with its youthful spirit, subdued the flying strongmen, with a score of 3-1 in the first half.

In the second half, Guo Zhuochang added another goal, ending the game with a score of 4-1. This was the army's only victory today. The Chinese team's lineup is as follows:

Yu Qi'en

Li Guowei He Jiaqiang

Chen Jinpei Kong Qingyu He Youji

Liang Bingkun Li Chunfa Miao Changrong Guo Zhuochang Li Wenhui

### New Foreign Exchange Policy Takes Effect - Export Industry Improves Daily - Changing Forward Exchange Interest Benefits Exporters

[Our Report] A person in charge of the Foreign Exchange Fund Balancing Committee explained the importance of the committee's recent approval of changes to forward exchange interest. The forward exchange interest rate was originally set at 4% per month, but is now changed to 8% for the first month, 11% for the second month, and 15% for the third month. The forward exchange interest for a three-month period will be 34%.

He said: The main purpose of this measure is to increase the interest burden of forward exchange and reduce the large-scale forward exchange purchases by importers. It will help exporters, as exporters can still apply for early loans from banks based on letters of credit.

He pointed out that the total value of exports in the four weeks after the establishment of the Balancing Committee exceeded the average monthly value of exports before the war. The value of exports in the recent two weeks is also balanced with the average weekly value of exports in the past four weeks. This shows that the export situation has indeed improved. Moreover, it is now the export season, and if transportation is not subject to unexpected delays, the export situation will continue to improve daily.

The world market prices of our country's export goods, except for tung oil, have not seen significant depreciation. When tung oil was purchased by the China Trust Bureau, it was only US$0.20 per pound, but it gradually increased to US$0.25. Recently, due to the dumping of 2,000 tons by a tung oil merchant in Hong Kong, it plummeted to US$0.22. However, the market price is now gradually improving, and the market price of pig bristles is still stable.

### Many Parties Close Out Positions - The Situation of Chinese Stocks is Uncertain

Yesterday, the Chinese stock market encountered the day of the transfer period for cash delivery. The bulls finally became discouraged and closed out their positions in cash delivery. The morning market ended at a low level. In the afternoon, off-market buyers suddenly became enthusiastic, and the Cantonese banks strongly purchased, turning to a stable trend. There were not many transactions, and the future is still uncertain.

At the beginning of the morning, the market was flat and weak. After the opening of Yongsheng Yarn, it immediately plummeted to 260 yuan for cash delivery and 270 yuan for forward delivery. After 10:15, there were purchases at low prices, and there was a slight struggle, but soon the off-market interest rates were still high at 2.7 cents and 3.15 cents, and there were many sellers, forcing the prices down to 260 yuan and 270 yuan. Then, as the buyers were slightly smoother, they pulled up to 264 yuan and 275 yuan, but it was rumored that the labor unrest was serious, and many people were cutting losses off-market. The pavilion rats were trying to sell short in the market, and the sellers followed one after another, and the prices gradually dropped to a low price of 255 yuan and 265 yuan near noon. Forward delivery closed at 267 yuan. After the close, Yongsheng Yarn was called lower, and as a result, compared with the previous close of cash delivery stocks, Yongsheng underwear Liann Jinglun Matches Zhongfang Zhabei Hengfeng slightly decreased, Xinhe Maya Huafeng Xinguang Jingfu Sino-French Qinxing Zhongsi Tongyi Rongfeng Huaxin each fell by half a percent, Xinhua fell by ten percent. In terms of forward delivery stocks, Yongsheng slightly rose, Xinhe slightly fell, and Hua fell by half a percent.

In the afternoon, there were repeated acquisitions, and the National Bank's difference was not much. Yongsheng gradually rose to a high price of 260 yuan for cash delivery and 268.5 yuan for delivery, before there were sell-offs. Afterwards, it closed at 258 yuan and 268 yuan. As a result, compared with the most recent close of cash delivery stocks, Yongsheng Xinhe Maya Xinguang Jingfu underwear slightly rose, Huafeng Xinhua matches Xinya Hengfeng Zhongfang Zhabei Tongyi Rongfeng were flat, Qinxing Zhongsi slightly decreased, and Huaxin fell by half a percent again, further away from the premium. In terms of forward delivery stocks, Xinhe was still flat, Yongsheng Liangfu slightly rose, and Maya Huafeng Xinguang slightly decreased. Various old stocks off-market fell a little again.

In the current transfer period, the arbitrage interest rate was about 1.6 to 2 cents, and the bulls were unwilling to bear the premium, so the initial high continued to be low. The banks helped to advance, but the bulls were not crowded. Yongsheng opened at 11 yuan, and retreated from 11.5 yuan to close at 9.5 yuan. Maya retreated from 18.5 yuan to 14 yuan, and closed at 14.5 yuan. Xinhe fell from 6.5 yuan to 4.5 yuan.

### Unified Bonds Weak - Foreign Stocks Hover

Government bonds were slightly weak yesterday. Although 555 and 552 advanced, 360 and 503 were sold. Tong Bing opened at 15,500 yuan, starting from 15,000 yuan, and traded up to 16,500 yuan before flattening. As a result, compared with the previous close, A and B fell by 300 yuan, C fell by 400 yuan, and D fell by 100 yuan. Tong Wu was flat, with a transaction volume of about 5 million.

Foreign stocks hovered again yesterday. Foreign companies had different inflows and outflows. Securities companies sold, while Cantonese banks bought. Yisha opened at 127,000 yuan in the morning, with a low price of 126,500 yuan and a high price of 128,500 yuan. The afternoon was mediocre. As a result, compared with the previous close, Yeguang fell by half a percent, Wheelock Marden Navigation was flat, and the rest slightly decreased.

### Pre-War Debt - Repayment Method

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 2nd] According to a report from the United Credit Bureau, the pre-war debt repayment method passed by the Political Affairs Conference the other day only applies to the settlement of value relations between private individuals and banks. It does not apply to government bonds issued by the state, debts between individuals, and debt relations between government agencies and banks.

### Food Rice Supply is Smooth - Japonica and Indica Trends are Weak

Yesterday, the north and south markets together had more than 17,100 stones of rice. In the early morning market in the south, both japonica and indica rice fell, and stabilized at noon. As a result, japonica and indica rice still tended to be weak, falling back by 35,000 to 10,000 yuan. The northern market opened tight, and also became slack at noon. In the end, due to the influx of sources, it was still sluggish. There are more than 300 rice boats stored in Hubie and Hexia in the southern market, totaling about 30,000 stones, and the future may be difficult to share the prosperity.

There are continuous shipments of flour from other places, and the market is sluggish, falling back by 3,4000 yuan. Unified powder and miscellaneous brand powder each fell by 3,5000 yuan, and the price of rationed powder remained unchanged, but it was higher than the various powders on the market, so there were very few applicants. The actual sales of bran were sluggish, falling back by 1,000 yuan. Soybean cake and oil head remained unchanged, falling by more than 1,000 yuan. Soybean oil factories and main streets successively purchased, and the goods were scarce and strong, gradually increasing by 35,000 yuan, and the future situation is still promising. Mung beans from Nanyang were cold and sluggish, gradually decreasing by 6,7000 yuan.

Field peas from Shantou were used one after another, and the amount stored in Shanghai was very small, which was still firm. Broad beans have already been filled by customers, and retail sales are slightly stable. Red sorghum was absorbed by wineries, and the market was firm. Corn from the north was very slack, and the trend was softening. Raw peanuts had no movement in customer sales, and the main street was normal, but there were not many arrivals. Old goods were flat, and new goods were raised by 10,000 yuan. Sesame seeds were actively sold, and continued to rise, continuing to rise by 120,000 yuan.

The oil market rose and fell differently. Raw oil digestion was still active and remained promising. Sesame oil fell back by 10,000 yuan. Rapeseed oil supply was greater than demand, and it sharply decreased by 230,000 yuan. The grid of soybean oil was flat and weak, and refined oil followed the decline by 10,000 yuan, and rationed oil continued to be processed.

### Slightly Active Export Tea

Recently, green tea such as Chouzhen and Zhenmei, which tea merchants in the city promoted to North Africa, has now found an outlet, which has gradually revealed clues in the buying sentiment in yesterday's market, while the number of transactions is still sporadically opened in the special goods that hold up. Although the market has not made significant progress, it is more stable than before.

Qimen black tea, the sellers' asking prices also consistently increased by 10-20%, but unfortunately, buyers, in view of the weak demand abroad, and the sparing prices, are still unwilling to rush to take, and the process is quite a game of back and forth.

Various domestic sales tea, in addition to the continued sluggish sales in the Tianjin area, the sales in the main street shops and Suzhou, Wuxi and other places are still smooth, and the market is upward.

### Sugar Steps Loosely

Yesterday, the sugar market still showed a soft trend, with a difference of 20,000 yuan to several thousand yuan.

### Yarn Merchants' Representatives Visit Wu Weijing - Requesting a Review of the Stopped Allocation Numbers - Cloth Merchants Refuse to Open Central Textile Cotton Cloth

[Our Report] The city's Yarn Merchants' Association believes that the Textile Construction Company's recent announcement to stop allocating yarn to 284 members of the association is due to inaccurate investigations. Yesterday, they sent representatives Tang Zhiliang, Shen Boqin, Yin Peiyuan, Chen Junming and other four to visit Wu Weijing, deputy general manager of the Textile Construction Company, requesting that the stopped allocation numbers be reviewed immediately. Wu said that if the stopped allocation numbers are considered inaccurate, they can submit a letter for review, and hoped that the heads of the association would provide assistance and provide information for the company to refer to.

[Our Report] The Cotton Cloth Association is automatically investigating the member firms whose numbers have been suspended by Textile Construction, starting yesterday, and will provide it to Textile Construction for reference after the investigation is completed. Textile Construction opened cloth yesterday, and the cotton cloth industry still did not go to open sales.

The market for the whole day, except for the hot-selling dragon head and other fine cloths and plain cloth, grey twill, the market was slightly better by 2,3000 to 120,000 yuan, and the rest of the cloths had no glory or shame.

Spot Cotton Rises

Yesterday, spot cotton yarn factories had a desire to absorb, and the industry had intentions to advance, and the market turned flat, and the price rose slightly compared to the previous day. The total transaction for the whole day was more than 1,100 bales.

The plant still had a very quiet transaction due to the fact that the capital had not yet loosened, and the calling prices for all levels remained at the original level, and the five dans were all lacking. The transaction price for other dans was the same as the previous day, and there was no increase or decrease in the asking price for dried.

### The Fourth Disease: A Childhood Infectious Disease Resembling Scarlet Fever but Not Scarlet Fever

— Cheng Hanzhang

Recently, some children in this city have contracted an infectious disease with fever and red rashes, resembling scarlet fever in appearance, but it is actually not scarlet fever and is not as severe. This is called the Fourth Disease (Fourth disease), also known as Filatov-Dukes' disease (Filatou Duke's disease). It was first recorded by Dr. Dukes in a British hospital in 1900 AD. However, Russian physician Filatov had also reported it several years earlier, so the disease is named Filatov-Dukes' disease, combining both names.

The cause of this disease is still unclear today. Many people claim it belongs to the rubella family of diseases. However, it is actually different from rubella.

The targets of infection are mostly children. After infection, there must be an incubation period of nine days to three weeks, and then a slight fever is felt, while red rashes appear on the body. However, some may experience headaches and nausea first. The rash consists of small rose-red spots, starting from the lips and nose, gradually spreading to the chest, upper limbs, abdomen, and lower limbs, and then to the whole body. These rashes do not rise above the surface of the skin. There are also no mucosal rashes. However, the conjunctiva and throat may appear slightly congested. The cervical lymph nodes may be slightly swollen, but to a lesser extent than in rubella. The rash fades in two or three days. Afterwards, there is no skin pigmentation. Peeling occurs in a bran-like form, completely shedding in one or two weeks.

The sick children do not feel very uncomfortable, and there are no complications or sequelae during the illness.

Although the illness is very mild, diagnosis is not easy because it is very similar to rubella or scarlet fever. However, diagnosis is not difficult in the middle of the illness.

Since this disease is not dangerous, no medication is needed for treatment. Just pay attention to its course and nutrition.

### The Importance of Whooping Cough and Its Treatment (Continued)

— Shou Zaiwu

Second stage: The longest period, with more severe coughing and thick, sticky phlegm. Coughing occurs in spasms, the face is tense, and the complexion is red and purple. After coughing, a deep, long breath is inhaled. Coughing sounds are incessant, the neck and back are hunched, and once the coughing subsides slightly, phlegm and food are vomited until the stomach is empty. It is lighter during the day and heavier at night.

Third stage: The recovery period. Coughing gradually becomes lighter, the paroxysms significantly decrease, phlegm is easier to cough up, there is no vomiting, one can eat, sleep is better at night, and the patient's condition gradually improves.

The importance of whooping cough lies not only in the long-term coughing, which depletes physical strength, frequent vomiting, which leads to nutritional loss, and frequent coughing at night, which disturbs sleep, but also in the physical spasms during coughing, which cause the chest muscles to contract and relax irregularly. The lungs and trachea are directly affected by external pressure, leading to insufficient gas exchange in the blood and congestion in the local lung tissue. This can result in nosebleeds, throat bleeding, rupture and bleeding of the tracheal mucosa, perforation of the lung tissue leading to pneumothorax, subcutaneous emphysema, conjunctival hemorrhage, eyeball hemorrhage, and retinal hemorrhage. Bleeding in the ear and meningeal hemorrhage are particularly important complications of this disease. It can also lead to limb spasms, left and right hemiplegia, coma and recovery, heart failure, or physical and mental exhaustion. Various reasons can lead to death. In those with rickets, it can develop into hilar tuberculosis. Those already infected with hilar tuberculosis can develop active and severe pulmonary tuberculosis. Furthermore, miliary (i.e., disseminated) pulmonary tuberculosis and intestinal tuberculosis can often develop from whooping cough. The induction of chronic meningitis is also a common fact of this disease. I once saw a long advertisement in the news offering a huge sum of money to find families with chronic meningitis that had been cured several times, but the results were likely impossible to achieve. Young infants who contract this disease are prone to pneumonia, especially those under three months old, making it particularly dangerous. I once saw a magazine report that a pregnant woman had whooping cough before giving birth, and the baby also had whooping cough when it was born, indicating the importance of this disease.

The treatment for whooping cough requires isolation of the affected child. If in school, teachers should order the child to return home for treatment and only return to school after recovery. If at home, children who have not contracted the disease should live and eat separately. The living space should be spacious and well-ventilated, not too cold in summer and not too hot in winter. Any food that is not difficult to digest or irritating can be given for three meals a day. Rice porridge, rice, vegetables, milk, and meat can all be eaten freely. When vomiting is severe, liquids are easier to swallow than solids, and semi-solid food is more appropriate. Repeat feeding after vomiting. Cough medicine should be taken according to the stage of the disease. Antipyretics should be given mainly through injections. Whooping cough vaccines may or may not be effective for early prevention. If there is a tendency or suspicion of pulmonary tuberculosis, Stryptomycin can be tried. However, the latter is extremely expensive and requires continuous injections, which is difficult for ordinary families to afford, making it a drawback. Moderate use can cure many cases of whooping cough.

In summary, whooping cough is generally considered an insignificant disease in Chinese society. No attention is paid at the beginning, and families with some knowledge often take over-the-counter medicines such as white pine syrup, cough syrup, and creosote. Over weeks and months, the disease deepens, and it becomes difficult to cure when seeking medical help again. Some also take almond juice internally, boil sparrows in soup internally, or take saliva from a frightened person internally, calling them folk remedies. These non-physical and chemical treatments cannot be effective after all. Aunt Wang says this remedy is really effective. Grandma Zhang says this remedy is very effective. Patients who seek medical help say that folk remedies have all been tried one by one, but none are effective. From this, the effectiveness can be known. In today's developed new medicine, although there is no specific medicine for whooping cough that can cure it immediately and effectively, shortening the course of the disease, reducing pain, and avoiding harm are also goals of treatment. The neighbor's grandmother says that whooping cough heals itself when blood is seen. An old fellow villager from Shandong says that my child was healed in three days. These are all unfounded claims and should not be believed. I once saw a young child with whooping cough that lasted for eight months. Blood was seen three times, for a total of more than ten days, but he still recovered through careful diagnosis and treatment. As for mild cases, treatment is easier, but how many people recover without medicine? According to clinical experience, about 70% or more of those with whooping cough are cured, but the time required is the only focus of treatment for this disease.

### Prognosis and Nursing of Typhoid Fever Patients

— Xie Yunshou

People often talk about illnesses among relatives and friends. If they know it is a cold with a fever, most people do not pay much attention, thinking that a cold with a fever will not cause any danger. But if they hear it is typhoid fever, their expressions inevitably become very tense. Why is this? Because typhoid fever can lead to death. Even if one is lucky enough to survive, they will have to stay in bed for at least one or two months. It is currently late summer and early autumn, which is the season when typhoid fever is prevalent. What are the dangers after contracting typhoid fever? I think this is something everyone wants to know.

Speaking of whether there is danger after contracting typhoid fever and the degree of danger, this is called prognosis in medicine. The prognosis for typhoid fever patients is certainly not optimistic because many patients with mild conditions suddenly experience intestinal bleeding or intestinal perforation, leading to death. From general observations, we can draw the following conclusions:

Systemic symptoms, such as a very high fever, consistently above 40 degrees Celsius, and a rapid and weak pulse, consistently above 120, indicate a very dangerous prognosis.

Severe neurological symptoms, such as picking at the air, fidgeting in bed, mania, shouting angrily, hitting around, or delirium, muttering, or even severe headaches, opisthotonos, hyperesthesia, and stiff neck, resembling meningitis, are called pseudomeningitis or typhoid meningitis, and the prognosis is mostly dangerous.

Typhoid fever is often accompanied by bronchitis or bronchiolitis. If the patient is drowsy during the onset of typhoid fever, it is difficult to cough up secretions from the bronchioles, and they are often lying down, it is easy to develop severe bronchiolitis. This small bronchiolitis can easily cause bronchopneumonia, which can then lead to hypostatic pneumonia or aspiration pneumonia, which is also a dangerous situation.

During typhoid fever, there is often some protein in the urine (below 0.5%). If the protein increases, urine output decreases, and there is blood and casts in the urine, it means nephritis has developed, and the prognosis is also poor.

Constitution and individual factors are also relevant. Intestinal perforation and intestinal bleeding are less common in children with typhoid fever than in adults. Although neurological symptoms can sometimes be very severe, the prognosis is better than in adults. In elderly people with typhoid fever, although the fever may not be very high, their neurological symptoms, respiratory and circulatory disorders are often very severe, so the outcome is often unfavorable. Obese people and heavy drinkers often have weak heart function, so the prognosis is also poor. (To be continued)

### On Misers

— Qi Ping

Misers certainly have their inimitable qualities. For example, most of them are self-made individuals who have struggled with society since childhood, and their spirit of perseverance is quite admirable. However, on the other hand, "life is like a dream, how much joy is there?" Their degree of "self-denial" is really too self-afflictive!

Professor Parsons of New York University in the United States is a specialist in the study of misers. The information he has collected on misers is unparalleled in the world. His conclusion from years of research on this subject is that most misers lead miserable lives!

The most miserable miser must be Fougères, a French tycoon in the 19th century. He hoarded all the wealth he had accumulated throughout his life, and even installed a secret door at the entrance to the cellar, which no outsider could possibly know about. One night, when he lit a candle to count his money, a gust of wind suddenly slammed the secret door shut, and Fougères was buried alive in the cellar! Outsiders had no idea where he had gone, and misers all lived in seclusion, so no one cared about the life or death of those stingy ghosts. Years later, someone bought the house and wanted to build a wine cellar, and unintentionally discovered Mr. Fougères, who had starved to death next to his huge stash of gold - poor fellow, he had chewed away most of the candle, and had even gnawed away a lot of the meat on his body!

In medieval England, there was a miser named Oveross. This man was a bachelor with a lot of hidden gold and was extremely suspicious of his servants, fearing that they would covet his wealth. According to the customs of the time, servants did not need to fast and mourn when a family member died. So Oveross had a brilliant idea and immediately pretended to be dead in order to save money. But his servants did not care about this and instead started eating heartily after the master died. Oveross secretly peeked from the deathbed and was so enraged that he sat bolt upright. The servant thought a ghost had appeared, grabbed a rake leaning against the wall, and struck the master hard - this time, Oveross really died.

There was also an 80-year-old widower in England who went to see a doctor when he was seriously ill. The doctor advised him to drink a little wine. The old man was shocked, because he had countless bottles of fine wine hidden at home, but he was afraid of letting others know and would rather spend money to buy a little - because money was a good thing that he was reluctant to part with. He finally gave in and walked step by step to the wine cellar, but he was old and weak, stumbled, and immediately lost his life.

A hundred years ago, there was a nervous merchant in Paris who suddenly felt that there would definitely be a white kerosene panic in the world. He used all his property to buy white kerosene and hoard it. But the white kerosene panic never happened, and the man wasted all his efforts, and all the white kerosene rotted. Many years later, his neighbors found his body in a pile of rotten white kerosene.

The most famous miser in the United States was a woman named Hetty Green. When Hetty was young, she was a beautiful, intelligent, and popular girl. But after her aunt left her an inheritance worth one hundred American dollars, she immediately changed her ways. She mingled with some of the most ruthless and vicious merchants on Wall Street, learned to be sharp and quick, and only knew how to make money for herself, regardless of whether other people lived or died. She made a fortune, but she wore the same old black dress every day and lived alone in a cheap apartment. When she occasionally went out to eat, the waiter never expected to get a penny of tip from her. She "suffered" all her life, and when she died of illness in 1916, she left behind more than $100 million in property.

### The Pronoun for Airplanes - Qi

In newspapers and magazines, we often see airplanes of various designs represented by numbers and a letter, such as B-29 and P-40. What do the letters B and P in front of them represent? I will now write down their meanings below:

A - Light bomber, for example: A-20

B - Bomber, for example: B-29

C - Transport aircraft, for example: C-46

F - Camera aircraft, for example: F-2

G - Glider, for example: G-6 L - Liaison aircraft, for example: L-20

O - Observation aircraft, for example: O-50

OA - Amphibious observation aircraft, for example: OA-19

P - Pursuit aircraft, for example: P-40

PT - Primary trainer, for example: PT-14

BT - Basic trainer, for example: BT-14

AT - Advanced trainer, for example: AT-7

The above are the symbols used by the U.S. Army.

F - Fighter, for example: F2A-3

J - Utility aircraft, for example: J4F-1

N - Trainer

P - Patrol aircraft

PB - Patrol bomber, for example: PBY-5

SB - Scout bomber, for example: SB2U-3

TB - Torpedo bomber, for example: TBD-1

OS or SO - Observation aircraft, for example: SO3C-1

Q - Glider

R - Transport aircraft, for example: R5D

The above are the symbols used by the U.S. Navy.

From these representative letters, we can know the purpose of a certain aircraft.

### Cremation and Burial at Sea

— Wei

In this degenerate world, it is difficult to live and equally difficult to die. Wealthy families spend lavishly during their lives and have grand funerals after death, which is understandable. The most difficult situation is for the proletariat, who struggle for a living during their lives and never get any rest. If they unfortunately die, the cost of funeral arrangements and burial will deplete their assets and still be insufficient, and the living expenses of the surviving family members are not guaranteed. Therefore, from the perspective of thorough frugality, cremation and burial at sea are necessary to promote.

The other day, the old educator and musician, former principal of Nanyang Public School Affiliated Elementary School, Shen Shuda (Xin Gong), held a burial at sea after cremation. His wise son also followed his father's will and published a farewell notice to relatives and friends in the newspaper instead of sending out obituaries, and used the money saved from funeral expenses and condolences from relatives and friends as a music scholarship fund. This is a good and beautiful idea and worthy of emulation. Frugal funerals should be promoted for three reasons:

First, from an economic standpoint, as the ancients said: "When the country is poor, talk about frugality and frugal funerals." Frugality is a matter of life, reducing clothing and food, abandoning extravagance, and not wasting. A frugal funeral is a matter after death. Lavish funerals and excessive rituals should be avoided. Saving a thousand or ten thousand for one family, ten families is millions, and extending this, it may be possible to cure the country's poverty by one in ten thousand.

Second, in terms of etiquette, extravagant funerals are originally a means for descendants to flaunt their wealth and superstition, which contradicts the principles of social economy and is inconsistent with the ancients. Mozi did not approve of extravagant funerals and long mourning periods and established a burial method, saying: "A coffin three inches thick is enough to rot the bones, three layers of clothing are enough to rot the flesh, dig the ground deep, so that there is no leakage below, and no gas vents above. The mound is enough to mark its location, and that is all." He even further stated that extravagant funerals and long mourning periods, heavy coffins and outer coffins, many clothes and bedding, sending off the dead as if moving, three years of mourning, being supported when standing up, walking with a cane, the ears hear nothing, the eyes see nothing, is enough to ruin the world.

Third, from a philosophical point of view, the most thorough approach is what Yan Pingzhong said to Guan Zhong: "Once dead, what is there to do with me? Burn it, sink it, bury it, expose it, wrap it in firewood and throw it into a ditch, or wrap it in embroidered robes and bury it in a stone coffin, whatever fate may bring..." (Liezi Yang Zhu Chapter)

The so-called burning it or sinking it is an explanation of cremation and burial at sea. The number of coffins awaiting burial in Shanghai is the highest among the world's major cities, numbering more than 100,000. An article in the American "Life Magazine" about Mayor Wu's work on Shanghai's municipal administration included a photo of coffins piled high like mountains in funeral homes, which is shocking. If people in society can change their mindset and promote cremation and burial at sea, it will also be a way to solve many intractable problems.

### On Filial Piety

— Ding Ye

No one reads the Classic of Filial Piety now, and I guess no one reads the Biographies of Exemplary Women either. We haven't seen the illustrations of the Twenty-Four Filial Exemplars for a long time. But recently, a small booklet called "Illustrated Compendium of Twenty-Four Filial Exemplars and Twenty-Four Filial Women" has been printed and published, doubling the previous number to a total of forty-eight filial exemplars. It is said that it sold quite a few copies during "Father's Day." Parents probably bought it for their children, hoping that they would learn this Chinese "ancient filial piety"!

Speaking of "filial piety," Chinese history is full of stories about it. Emperors "governed the world with filial piety," and officials should "serve their parents with filial piety before serving their rulers with loyalty." Since Confucius and Mencius, gentlemen who promoted filial piety have followed one after another, so China relies on this to remain a country of morality. Now, the gentlemen have specially printed the Forty-Eight Filial Exemplars. This booklet can be called a complete work that collects filial sons from all dynasties in one book.

I know that the first half of this book, the Twenty-Four Filial Exemplars, was written by Guo Juye of the Yuan Dynasty. According to the editor, the second half, the Twenty-Four Filial Women, was compiled by modern people. It is said that the purpose of printing this book is to "benefit the world's morals and people's hearts." It is also hoped that "if everyone can extend their love for their parents to love their families, love their country, and love humanity, then advancing the world to great harmony will also start with this book!" The editor's intention is great enough!

But my prejudice has always been a little disgusted with the Twenty-Four Filial Exemplars. I don't know how I saw this great work that "advances the world to great harmony starting with this book," which makes me feel like I have a bone stuck in my throat, and I have to spit out the unpleasant words. If this book is printed for the middle-aged generation, I think they are already fathers themselves, and they only hope that their sons will be filial to them. They may not be happy if they have to follow the Twenty-Four Filial Exemplars to be filial to old people over sixty years old. If it is made for the younger generation to read, I dare not wish them to read this book. Because if the stories in this book are analyzed from a modern perspective, many of them not only do not benefit young people, but also contain superstitious, cruel, and unintelligent poisons.

For example, Meng Zong "weeping for bamboo to produce shoots" and Wang Xiang "lying on ice to seek carp" are fundamentally unreasonable miracles. How can Dong Yong "selling himself to bury his father" meet a fairy, isn't this close to encouraging people to be otherworldly? Also, what is the thinking behind Guo Ju and his wife's "burying their son for the sake of their mother," they killed their next generation to save the old and decaying! Is it possible to let people today play this set again! Everyone learns from Lao Laizi's "playing with colors to please his parents" and Yu Qianlou's "tasting feces to worry about his parents" to "advance the world to great harmony." I really admire Mr. Gang's painstaking efforts!

Secondly, such as the newly compiled Twenty-Four Filial Women, most of them inherit the meaning of the previous Twenty-Four Filial Exemplars. The difference is that the so-called "never changing after marriage," the editor does not know what is the intention, to ask modern women to abide by the "virtuous women do not serve two husbands" doctrine? Also, Wang Lanzhen's "speaking frankly to advise her father," she privately burned the Romance of the Western Chamber and Dream of the Red Chamber that her father had hand-written notes on. The editor probably thinks it is a "virtuous thing," but these two works have been recognized as valuable works since the May Fourth Movement. How much research has been published on the Dream of the Red Chamber after Hu Shi, and it was once even compiled into textbooks. The editor does not know if he knows these things? If not, you can look through the "A Brief History of Chinese Fiction." Finally, there is an article called "Blood from the Arm to Make Pills," which must be said. This matter is transformed from "cutting flesh to heal relatives," but this poison still exists today, and there is no need for the editor to promote it again. A Hangzhou newsletter was recently reported: "Zhao Xiuying, a female student in a middle school in this city, cut flesh to heal her relatives, and fainted on the spot..." According to the editor, this is "beneficial to the world's morals and people's hearts."

### Miss America

— Xu Shuyuan

Miss America in the Family

Those who do not understand the American family environment certainly have a wrong perception of American women, believing that American women, apart from dancing, watching movies, typing, and swimming, are generally indifferent to household chores. The truth is quite the opposite. It should be known that most American families cannot afford maids, and everything from cooking, washing, sweeping, to gardening must be done by themselves. Moreover, each person does their own tasks; mothers do not usually wash their daughters' clothes. Therefore, a young lady living in a household has many things to take care of. Even if she leaves her parents and rents an apartment, she must bear all the chores. Getting up in the morning, she goes into the kitchen to brew coffee and toast bread on the electric stove. After breakfast, she tidies the room or mops the floor. There are electric sweepers for sweeping, but there is no machine for mopping the floor, so she still has to rely on a mop. After finishing work, she goes to the office or school. Lunch is mostly eaten in restaurants, but some people also bring lunch boxes and thermos bottles to eat at their workplaces. Those lunch boxes are very exquisitely made, some like a cosmetic case, some are transparent, revealing a thermos bottle and two sandwiches, which are not cumbersome or conspicuous to carry. Coming home from work, she cooks a hearty dinner. After dinner, she washes a few odd pieces of clothing or does some needlework. It is easy to find a hand-cranked sewing machine in Miss America's boudoir. That kind of sewing machine is as small as a toy, and you can sew seasonal fashions on that small sewing machine. However, formal dresses and expensive clothes are mostly custom-made in clothing stores, and the sewing is quite expensive. What you can do yourself, you will never buy from clothing stores. In America, using a washing machine to wash clothes is not a big deal. You just put the soap powder and clothes in the washing machine, turn on the power, and in three to five minutes, it's done. But ironing clothes requires manual labor, which is more troublesome, especially in summer, when there are many clothes and the weather is hot. This is a relatively heavy task in housework. Only after finishing a day's work can you go out to attend banquets. Sunday seems to be relatively leisurely, but in reality, it is even busier. In the morning, she changes into new clothes and goes to church for worship, which every young lady should participate in, unless she has no religious beliefs. After returning from worship, most people spend their time cleaning the house, mopping the floor, airing carpets, washing cars, watering flowers, and planting vegetables. If there is a vegetable garden behind the house, some people also paint floors and whitewash walls on Sundays, exhausting their delicate bodies. Such work has a special home economics course in universities and middle schools, so 99% of American women know how to cook and sew and handle household chores in an orderly manner. On the other hand, Chinese ladies who pride themselves on being virtuous grow up being served by servants, gradually shifting their activity centers to dance halls, nightclubs, and cinemas. Chinese ladies have already lost the virtues of the old era and have not yet acquired the life skills of the new era, creating many social butterflies, young mistresses, vases, and even concubines and dancers in society. This can also be said to be a failure of the new era of education, a comedy in the process of Europeanization.

### Remembering Powell

— Binzhi

On February 28th of this year, when the University of Missouri alumni association held a meeting in Washington, Powell gave a speech expounding on the situation in the Far East. He said, "If a war breaks out between the United States and the Soviet Union, the battlefield will definitely be in the Far East, not in Europe. In Asia today, communism, imperialism, and American democracy are competing with each other. The tendency of hundreds of millions of people in China and India depends entirely on the future direction of the United States. In the Far East, Siberia, China, and India are three major political regions, especially China, which is the key to Asia. To maintain our position in the Far East, we must use our intelligence and skills to help Asia and transform Asia."

Powell's name is not unfamiliar in China. He is the father of Little Powell, the current host of the China Weekly Review. Powell was from Missouri. He studied journalism at the University of Missouri, and after graduating, he engaged in journalism in Hannibal. He then returned to his alma mater as a lecturer. After that, he was an editor and reporter for various newspapers, gradually showing his talent in the newspaper world. In 1917, he went to Shanghai and took over the China Weekly Review, using his sharp pen to discuss the Far East and the world political situation, with many insightful and unique views.

Powell spent more than 20 years in China, always paying attention to the situation in the Far East and reporting it to the world. When Japan planned to invade China, he was the first to expose its ambitions and issued warnings to the world. The September 18th Incident proved that Powell's arguments were accurate. A year before the Lugouqiao Incident, Powell wrote a novel for the Chicago Tribune, implying Japan's preparations for war in the Far East. Powell was a famous reporter and author, especially for Far Eastern issues, he had in-depth research. If the countries had trusted Powell's remarks earlier, Japan would not have been so rampant.

Powell exposed Japan's ambitions and conspiracies everywhere, which was certainly resented by the Japanese, but there was nothing they could do. When the Japanese revealed their hideous faces and openly invaded China, Powell should have left his dangerous environment. But for the sake of human justice, he resolutely stayed in Shanghai and continued his work. As Shanghai fell into an isolated island, the power of the enemy and puppets expanded day by day in the concessions. Powell, who was regarded as a thorn in their side, naturally wanted to get rid of him. At first, they instigated traitors to expel him from the country, but Powell ignored them. A fake "secret agent" threw a grenade at him on Sichuan Road, but fortunately, he was unharmed. Under the enemy's threats and intimidation, Powell could not shake his sense of justice, and his remarks became even more sharp.

After the Pearl Harbor Incident, the enemy entered the concessions. Powell could not escape the enemy's clutches and was imprisoned in a concentration camp. He spent seven months in prison in the Broadway Mansion before being sent back to his country on a prisoner exchange ship. In those seven months, Powell's weight decreased by two-fifths, and one of his legs became numb and unable to move. Finally, it was amputated after returning to his country. After the victory, he still used one leg to go to Tokyo and testify at the Far East International Tribunal.

When Powell finished his speech at the University of Missouri alumni association, he suddenly died of a heart attack. We miss this friend of China, who suffered so much for China, and we feel very uneasy in our hearts. Seeing the turbulent situation in Asia today, we should remember Powell's last words even more.

Editor's note: Not long after JB died a few months ago, this journal wrote a memorial article.
