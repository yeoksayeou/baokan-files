### U.S. and Canada Military Aid to China: Negotiations Approaching a Decision Stage; Secretary Marshall Returns Home to Focus on Long-Term Plans

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 19th] Reliable sources report: Negotiations between the U.S. and Canada regarding military aid to China, which have been underway in Washington and Nanjing, are now approaching a decision stage. Both sides are currently engaging in frequent contacts on this matter, but the details remain highly confidential. Ambassador Stuart originally planned to fly to Beiping for a two-week vacation before Christmas, but has now decided to reduce it to one week. He will fly to Beiping on the 23rd, stay at Yenching University for seven days, and then return to Nanjing. It is generally speculated that this may be related to the ongoing negotiations between China and the U.S. on various aid programs to China. Furthermore, Foreign Minister Wang met with Canadian Ambassador Davis on the afternoon of the 18th for a lengthy and confidential discussion.

[United Press, Washington, 19th] The Senate Appropriations Committee last night at 11 p.m. approved an emergency foreign aid appropriation of $570 million, $61 million more than the House-approved amount. Of this, $550 million is earmarked for aid to France, Italy, and Austria, while $20 million is designated for aid to China. The bill has now been submitted to the Senate for discussion. Congress is scheduled to adjourn tonight, and the Senate will convene an hour earlier to ensure a decision can be reached before the recess. Regarding aid to China, neither the House resolution nor the original government proposal stipulated immediate allocation of funds. However, Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Bridges stated that the committee's decision was made in recognition of the importance of ensuring the continued functioning of the Chinese government. Congress may increase the appropriation amount after the State Department formally submits an aid to China bill next spring.

[Central News Agency, Washington, 18th, United Press] According to government officials, one of Secretary Marshall's priorities upon his return from London to the U.S. on the 19th will be a long-term aid to China plan. All indications suggest that the State Department's final proposal will far exceed the $300 million that Marshall estimated in Congress last month. Public interest in aid to China plans is growing in the United States, and Congress is pressing for action, forcing senior government officials to engage in serious discussions on the matter.

### Truman Promises to Urge Congress to Revive China Plan; Welcomes Stalin to Visit the U.S.

[United Press, Washington, 19th] President Truman on the 19th called for aid to revitalize the Far East, with particular emphasis on China. He also announced a $17 billion fund for the Marshall Plan to rebuild Europe. Truman promised that he would present a plan to revive China when Congress convenes in early January. Truman stated, "At present, our full attention is focused on Western Europe, as it is the most important region in the world in terms of peace and the future. However, we are also deeply concerned about war-torn Asia. The United States has provided substantial assistance to Japan and Korea to maintain livelihoods and commercial construction. After the war ended, we provided various important forms of assistance to China, with considerable success. The United States should continue to do its utmost to assist in the restoration of economic balance as a foundation for revitalization in the Far East. In recent months, we have been conducting a thorough study of how to meet the special needs of post-war relief in China. I hope to make recommendations to Congress on this matter during the next session."

[Central News Agency, Washington, 18th] President Truman stated today that he would welcome a meeting with Stalin if the latter were willing to come to Washington. He also said that he and Stalin had not exchanged messages recently. He expressed his strong belief that world peace would ultimately be achieved. He declined to comment on the breakdown of the Four Foreign Ministers Conference, stating that Secretary Marshall would explain the matter to the American people tomorrow evening.

### Bishop Corson Declares in Philadelphia: U.S. Future Lies in the Far East; Aid China Association Raises Funds Through Christmas Card Sales to Aid Our Country

[Our Dispatch] New York, 19th Broadcast: Washington report, Massachusetts State Senator Clarkson today urged immediate authorization of $60 million in temporary aid to China to alleviate the country's current severe difficulties, and proposed a plan to make the most effective use of these funds. He proposed allocating $30 million to purchase food, $4 million to purchase medical supplies, $15 million to purchase clothing, $5 million to purchase fertilizer, $500,000 to purchase seeds, $2 million to purchase miscellaneous items, and $3.5 million for transportation costs. Mr. Clarkson, a former sergeant during the war and now a businessman, has always been interested in China.

[United Press, Philadelphia, 19th] Methodist Bishop Corson, who recently returned from the Far East, stated yesterday that the Far East would not turn red unless the United States gave up. Aid to China is essential. Before China is unified, the value of relief work is difficult to estimate. The National Government is currently engaged in a war of defense, and the next twelve months will be a critical period in Chinese history. The economic future of the United States is tied to the Far East, and the Far East will provide the best missionary opportunities in a century. The people are ready to accept a new philosophy of life, and if Christian ideas are not adopted, it will greatly affect the future of the entire world.

[United States Information Service, New York, 18th] The United China Relief Association is continuing its practice of the past several years by selling Christmas cards, with all proceeds going to relief and service programs for China. Last year, the United China Relief Association sold approximately 420,000 Christmas cards, raising $35,000. This year's Christmas card designs are very appealing.

[United Press, Washington, 18th] House Democratic Floor Leader McCormack declared in the House of Representatives on the 18th: "The United States should provide military aid to China immediately."

He stated that while economic aid is important to the Chinese government's fight against the communists, military supplies are even more urgent. We have many surplus military materials in the Far East that could be used to help China resist aggression.

He continued: "We should not forget China's contribution in trapping Japan in a two-front war." He acknowledged that the Chinese government is "not perfect," but argued that criticisms were exaggerated. Even if there is corruption within the Chinese government, it is still a free government, at least in areas not occupied by the communists.

### Re-implementation of the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Control Policy

In order to stabilize prices and suppress speculation, the Executive Yuan, in addition to establishing the Financial Management Bureau to stabilize finance, also recognizes that the management of cotton yarn and cloth is closely related to prices. To strictly implement the management policy, it has adopted the plan of the National Economic Commission, reorganized the Ministry of Economic Affairs' original Spinning and Adjustment Committee into the National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Management Committee, and implemented the policy of commissioned spinning and weaving, unified purchase, and unified sale, in order to strengthen production, regulate supply, and benefit the people's livelihood. On the 5th of this month, the Executive Yuan's temporary meeting approved the organizational regulations of the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Management Committee and set the date of establishment as New Year's Day, with Yuan Liang taking the position of Chairman. Other personnel appointments will also be announced within the week. According to the Director of the Executive Yuan's News Bureau, Director Dong, in a statement on the 17th, after the establishment of the new cotton yarn and cloth management agency, yarn factories and weaving factories will produce for the government, and the government will allocate cotton, and they will spin and weave for the government. The government will carry out unified purchase and unified sale. This is a general outline of the government's restoration of wartime management policies. However, the reaction of general private yarn factories is different. Whether this major measure can be smoothly implemented and achieve the expected results depends on the efforts of the new agency in the future.

The establishment of the Ministry of Economic Affairs' Spinning Management Committee was originally a government agency for managing the textile industry, controlling yarn and cloth prices by means of price limits. This June, it was reorganized into the Textile Business Adjustment Committee, changing from rigid control to moderate adjustment. The method of stabilizing yarn prices changed from price limits to negotiated prices. Under the previous control policy, the increase in production was limited, and there was panic regarding raw materials from time to time. The black market for cotton yarn and cloth and the price limits became increasingly disparate, leading to the black market overwhelming the official price, and the spinning management policy was declared a failure. Later, the abandonment of control for adjustment, besides seeing institutional adjustments and personnel changes, did not have any significant achievements. On November 23rd, the National Economic Commission passed the "Outline for Joint Distribution of Cotton Yarn with Certificates," preparing to control yarn and cloth materials and continue to purchase cotton yarn, to implement commissioned spinning and weaving, and then negotiate prices and set up adjustment public warehouses to stabilize the national yarn and cloth market. After this method was announced, on the one hand, it aroused the opposition of the private textile industry, and on the other hand, it was supported by the copying industry. Soon there was talk of reorganizing the Spinning and Adjustment Committee again. Recently, following the wave of rising prices, the government decided to expand the distribution of daily necessities and decided to adopt wartime methods to strengthen the control of cotton yarn and cloth, entrusting the important responsibility of controlling national cotton yarn and cloth to the soon-to-be-established Cotton Yarn and Cloth Management Committee. Obviously, this adjustment is not simply a change of institutions and personnel, but a further and comprehensive development of the control policy, which is of greater significance.

According to the organizational regulations of the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Management Committee, its business scope is very broad, including the overall purchase, transportation, and distribution of national cotton, cotton yarn, and cotton cloth, the adjustment of market supply and demand, and the approval of prices, the increase and improvement of raw materials and finished products, the import of raw materials and the export of finished products, and even the zonal establishment of state-owned and private textile factories and the coordination of raw material producing areas, are all its main responsibilities. As for the control policy, according to the government's planned program, all yarn factories will spin and weave for the government, and the government guarantees that in addition to paying for labor and expenses, they will obtain reasonable profits. The goal of its implementation of management is not to establish a profit-making business organization, but to protect the interests of the public and prevent speculation. Theoretically speaking, cotton yarn and cloth belong to people's daily necessities, cotton yarn and cloth production should be for the people, and cotton yarn and cloth economy should be a people's livelihood economy, closely related to every people's living standards and production requirements. At this time of severe national economic crisis, the implementation of strict control, the prevention of black market speculation, and the crackdown on material hoarding should be very necessary measures. The problem lies in the efficiency of the administration, the steps of control, and the cooperative attitude of the private yarn factories; as for the supply of raw materials and quality technology, they are relatively easier to overcome.

Regarding the problem of raw cotton production, our country's output last year was 7.43 million dan, this year it has increased by 50%, and it may increase again next year. Coupled with the import of American cotton, there is no shortage of raw material sources. Our country's textile industry has a total of 4.5 million spindles, of which 3.6 million spindles are currently in operation. Based on spindles, the annual demand for raw cotton is 10.8 million dan. In addition, the hand-weaving industry still needs 2.5 million dan, totaling 13 million dan. In the future, the Management Committee will uniformly purchase raw cotton and distribute it, which should not be a problem in theory. Regarding commissioned spinning and weaving, the production activities of textile factories are guaranteed, as long as the controlling authorities have overall planning, fair supply of raw materials, fair commissioned spinning fees, and the problem of power is solved, and the factory is guaranteed not to stop work, then private yarn factories should support it. The main purpose of controlling yarn and cloth production today should be to facilitate distribution, followed by the export of finished products. If the main purpose of controlling yarn and cloth production is to export to foreign markets, rather than supply domestic distribution, not considering the root cause and focusing on the tip, it will depart from the "economic adjustment" and return to the path of "political control." This seems very unfavorable to the future of cotton yarn and cloth control.

In short, comprehensive control of cotton yarn and cloth is imperative. In order to stabilize prices, prevent speculation, and stabilize people's livelihood, implementing distribution is a necessary measure at present. We hope that the establishment of the new agency will take on this major responsibility with a new spirit of service and mobile management technology, dispelling public doubts with its performance in work. The failure of cotton yarn and cloth management during the war was not due to errors in the control policy, but to the low efficiency of the administration. The failures of the Spinning Management Committee and the Spinning Adjustment Committee after the war were not due to errors in price limits or adjustments, but because the wind of speculation and illegal manipulation undermined the government's decisions. Now that a new control agency has been established, it is endowed with authority, and given the magnitude of its responsibilities, it should not suffer another setback. We sincerely hope that the authorities can learn from the past lessons and be vigilant. On the one hand, they can stand on the position of the nation and the country, and on the other hand, they can protect the rights and interests of private enterprises, considering both the national economy and the people's livelihood, so that the implementation of the cotton yarn and cloth control policy can achieve the expected results.

### Multiple Corruption Cases in the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) Referred to the Courts for Investigation

[This City News] UNRRA announced: Director Huo of UNRRA has always paid close attention to the integrity of his staff. Recently, based on investigation reports, several cases of Jiaotong University have been dealt with, including:

Ji Jianchang, the representative of the Finance Department of the General Office stationed in Beiping and Tianjin, sold cotton to manufacturers who had not started work or had no spinning equipment, and forged contracts, leasing office buildings in his private name, which is suspected of corruption. In addition to dismissing the staff member, he has been transferred to the Tianjin District Court for investigation.

阎伟, the Deputy Director of the Jin-Cha-Sui Branch Office, colluded with Yan Shulin, the Director of the Storage and Transportation Group, Zheng Zuyin, the Director of the Beiping Warehouse, and merchants, using the name of the Shanxi Provincial Training Corps' public-operated marketing and sales cooperative to exchange relief flour of 10,500 bags in Beiping for wheat in Linfen, and resold it. In addition to dismissing Yan Wei and the other two, the case has been transferred to the Beiping Court for investigation.

### Independence of UNRRA Air Transport Cannot Happen, Likely to Improve the Post-War Committee

[Our News] The UNRRA Air Transport, headed by Flying Tiger General Chennault, should end at the end of this year in accordance with the original agreement signed with UNRRA. However, the Air Transport authorities have been in contact with all parties, hoping to continue operations, and are currently in discussions with the Executive Yuan authorities, possibly establishing an Air Transport under the name of the Executive Yuan's Post-War Committee. General Chen may sign an agreement with the committee on a monthly basis. It is learned that our Ministry of Communications cannot approve foreigners operating airlines independently, so the independent establishment of the Air Transport is impossible. The Ministry of Communications had intended to purchase all the equipment of the team, but it was not agreed to by the Air Transport. Chen had also discussed cooperation with the Southwest Airlines, jointly operated by the Guangdong and Guangxi provincial governments, but the negotiations were unsuccessful.

The UNRRA Air Transport has been in operation for less than a year. It currently has 19 usable aircraft, of which 12 are frequently flying, and another 25 are used as parts.

### 譚伯羽報告　交通進步困難

(Continued from page 1) In his report, Mr. Tan Boyu used facts to illustrate the difficulties in current transportation progress. He first stated: In the past six months, since the mobilization for suppressing the rebellion, the departments under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Communications have been facing destruction on a daily basis.

Regarding railways: of the more than 30,000 kilometers of railways nationwide, more than 15,000 kilometers were passable in January of this year. Currently, they continue to be damaged, and only more than 13,000 kilometers are passable. However, the new lines in South China have increased by 400 kilometers. In the Northeast, the Beining Railway was fully opened to traffic in early December, but it has now been cut off again. Of the more than 3,000 kilometers of road, only more than 1,300 kilometers are open for military use. In North China, the Zhengtai Railway from Shijiazhuang to Taiyuan has been impassable since October. The Jiaoji Railway was fully repaired last December, but it was destroyed again after only two months. Currently, the section from Jinan to Qingdao has been cut into three sections. The PingSui Railway was open to traffic until November, and there were still direct trains from Ping to Baotou. The PingHan Railway has suffered significant damage in the past one or two months. The southern section is impassable, and Zhengzhou is almost like an isolated island. The northern section has also undergone seven repairs. The portion north of Baoding is expected to be restored around the 25th of this month. The line from the PingHan Railway to Jiaozuo was restored earlier this year, but it was cut off again in April. Efforts are currently being made to restore it in order to utilize the coal from Jiaozuo. In South China, the YueHan Railway was repaired within a limited time frame last July due to military needs, but due to inadequate equipment, there have been issues. The ZheGan Railway from Jinhua to Quzhou was repaired in August of this year. In order to transport grain, it was planned to reach Nanchang directly from Hangzhou by the end of the year, but this was not achieved due to insufficient materials. It is now hoped that the materials will arrive by the end of January, and the goal can be achieved one month later. The Jinpu Railway has now been opened to traffic on the 12th of this month. This opening has great significance. Shanghai originally relied on coal from Kailuan, but it was greatly affected due to transportation inconveniences. Now, it can use coal from Boshan via the Jiaoji Railway. Jinan, which was originally an isolated island, can now communicate with the outside world.

Regarding highways, improvements are not easy due to changes in foreign exchange rates, shortages of gasoline, and fluctuations in prices. Currently, the focus is on driver training and military vehicle registration. Old roads are difficult to repair satisfactorily, while the new roads only include the Jixin Highway, which is 1,247 kilometers long, with an altitude of more than 3,000 meters. It was built by the Qinghai Provincial Government through requisitioning labor from the people. The process was like a Journey to the West. The road runs from Xining through Daotang River, Mangya to the Jinhong Mountain of the Southern Xinjiang Highway.

Regarding waterways, there are currently more than 951,000 tons of ships, with Shanghai accounting for the majority. Regarding shipping, military transport accounts for 5% of private companies, while military transport accounts for the majority of state-owned companies. Regarding overseas routes, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company was able to sail to the Philippines in July of this year, setting a precedent for flying the Chinese flag on the high seas. Regarding ports, Tanggu New Port and Huludao, etc., are all being completed with great effort.

Regarding aviation, China and Central Airlines have a total of 83 aircraft, of which 63 are flyable. In January of this year, more than 30 aircraft achieved a record of flying more than 40,000 kilometers. This month, 38 aircraft flew 78,000 kilometers. International routes, such as Sino-British, Sino-American, Sino-French, Sino-Dutch, and Sino- , have all been signed, but Siam has not yet been implemented. Currently, China Airlines officially took off on November 16 to Honolulu and San Francisco to participate in international flights. It is not yet possible for Central Airlines. The Ministry of Communications established the Civil Aviation Administration on January 20 of this year, and civil aviation management is now under the control of the Civil Aviation Administration.

Regarding telegraphs, there have been more than 4,000 instances of damage, with a loss of 1,470 tons of copper wire and more than 200 tons of wire being stolen. The personnel in charge of the repair project have stated that they have conducted eight major repairs from Beiping to Baoding, and the wire used can build more than 5,000 kilometers of telegraph lines. Since July of this year, we have been able to conduct direct telephone calls with the United States. The postal service is improving daily.

### 杜魯門總統咨文國會　提長期援歐程序　需一百七十億美元協助十六國復興　俾對世界和平有所貢獻

[United Press, Washington, 19th] President Truman formally requested Congress on the 19th to pass a bill allocating $17 billion to the Marshall Plan to rebuild Western Europe, maintain freedom, and prevent another war. The President submitted a 9,000-word message to Congress, urging it to use American money and productivity to fund the Marshall Plan so that it can be sustained until 1952. Truman said that the adoption of the Marshall Plan would be "evidence of the united freedom-loving people resisting totalitarian pressure, defending the foundations of freedom, and raising the living standards of all mankind." President Truman asked Congress to allocate funds to assist the 16 European countries in their efforts to help each other recover. He estimated that at least $6.8 billion would be needed in the 15 months after the start of the European aid program, which runs from April of this year to the end of June of the following year. Truman pointed out that this amount accounts for 5% of the cost of the United States in World War II. He said that during the effective period of the Marshall Plan, 3% of the United States' national income would exceed this amount. The President said: "The basic goal of the United States' continued assistance to European countries is to help these countries achieve economic self-sufficiency and contribute to world peace and prosperity with all their strength." Truman said that the European Recovery Program is fully in line with the principles of the United Nations Charter. "Free nations are working together to promote world peace. Any country that attempts to obstruct or undermine Europe for its own self-interest is clearly contrary to this goal." Truman pointed out: "Several governments in Eastern Europe were invited to participate in the Paris Conference to discuss economic cooperation, but they refused to participate. Their non-participation makes the recovery effort more difficult. On the other hand, it will undoubtedly prolong their own economic difficulties. This is not enough to prevent the restoration of trade between Eastern and Western Europe, as it is beneficial to both sides." The special Congress will adjourn on the evening of the 19th and reopen on January 6 of next year. This meeting is to pass the emergency European aid bill. Truman's message came one day after the end of the special Congress , and Congress will thoroughly study Truman's request on January 6. At the same time, even during the New Year's holiday, any committee of the two houses can start research at any time.

[United Press, Washington, 19th] In his speech today calling for the passage of the Marshall European Recovery Program, Truman said: "The Far East's exports to the United States help to pay for Europe's exports to the Far Eastern countries, so Europe is an important link in the world trade network."

### 推行計劃六要點　預定四年歐洲各國自給自足增加生產促進普遍繁榮

President Truman said that there are six basic points for implementing this plan: "This plan is to promote universal recovery within a specified period. "This plan is to use the money and goods we supply in the most effective way to revive Europe. "This plan aims to "reduce the financial cost of the United States on the one hand, and avoid burdening European countries with financial burdens that they cannot sustain for a long time on the other. "This plan was drafted with attention to preserving American resources while reducing the unfortunate consequences of aid to Europe on our country's economy. "This plan seeks to be consistent with other international relations and responsibilities of the United States. "The implementation of this plan is intended to be wise and effective."

President Truman emphasized the importance of "making Europe self-sufficient." He said that the key issue is "increasing Europe's production. The 16 countries have put forward a recovery plan in their report, which estimates that in four years, Europe can be self-sufficient and maintain a reasonable minimum standard of living without external assistance. This plan is based on the following four basic points: The participating countries make strong production efforts. Each country promotes domestic financial stability. Participating countries continue to cooperate with each other to the greatest extent. The solution to the trade deficit between the participating countries and North and South America, with special emphasis on increasing European exports.

參加十六國家　應守七大條件

Truman set down seven broad conditions for aid, including requiring assistance in the accumulation of American raw materials in addition to the domestic and commercial export needs of the 16 participating countries. Truman told Congress that every Marshall Plan country would guarantee to take individual and collective action to achieve recovery. Truman also put forward the following conditions (except where impossible to apply): "Promote agricultural and industrial production" so that it can get rid of the abnormal foreign economic assistance. Cooperate with each other "to reduce trade barriers between each other and promote the exchange of goods and gifts" "Balance the currency and establish or maintain confidence in its monetary system." Effectively use American goods and gifts. "Strengthen the production of prescribed raw materials and give priority to the United States in obtaining raw materials for accumulation in order to avoid exceeding reasonable domestic uses and commercial export needs." "Deposit the local currency equivalent to the price of the donated aid goods in a special account, which may be used only after mutual agreement between the two governments." "Information on the development of American aid and agreements between participating countries and between participating countries and the United States should be published domestically and provided to the United States."

### 援助方式　分貸款與贈與

However, Truman warned: "If our previous aid is used improperly, the United States certainly reserves the right to stop aid." He said that part of the aid is in the form of grants and part in the form of loans, and the standard is the solvency of each country. Countries that have the ability to purchase imports with cash or repay loans will not receive grants. Special loans may be needed later to balance currencies, but this cannot be estimated at this time. Truman also said that the promotion of the plan

### 推行馬歇爾計劃　成立經濟合作部　受援國應將戰略品售與美國

[United Press, Washington, 19th] The main points of the various bills related to the Marshall aid plan proposed by the US government are as follows: "The plan" will last until June 20, 1952, and the United States will assist Europe in its recovery with $15.1 billion to $17.8 billion. "What Congress is asking for" stipulates that the total US aid to foreign countries for the entire period is $17 billion, but only $6.8 billion can be allocated in the first 15 months starting from April 1, 1948, and gradually reduced to $2.2 billion in the last 12 months. Before Congress begins to allocate funds, $500 million will be paid in advance to transport supplies. The countries that should receive assistance include Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Ireland, France, Greece, Iceland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, the United Kingdom, Turkey, Sweden, and Switzerland. "Germany's contribution" revives the industrial resources of western Germany to assist the recovery of western Europe, but prevents the revival of militarism. To this end, the military will allocate an additional $822 million during the first 15 months to achieve this goal. "Political conditions" If the political situation in a country changes, the United States may decide whether it can continue to receive US assistance. "Management agency" A new agency called the Economic Cooperation Department is established, nominally equal to other departments of the government, but subject to the control of the Secretary of State on all diplomatic points. "US strategic necessities" European countries and their colonies should sell important strategic necessities to the United States and pay in cash to increase the production of these items. As far as the occasion goes, personal observations will become more and more important. This plan requires "the American people to make a little self-sacrifice," but there is no need to exaggerate this burden too much, because this plan "we can certainly afford it." After comparing the needs of the Marshall Plan with the US national income, Truman said, "This is an investment in the hope of world peace, security, and a better future, and the price is really not high." Truman specifically declared that the United States has no intention of losing contact with other American countries, "I especially want to point out that our current focus on the work in Western Europe does not diminish our interest in long-term economic cooperation with our neighbors in the Western Hemisphere. As one of the American countries, the American countries are now taking cooperative actions similar to those of European countries, so we must increase production to promote financial balance and eliminate trade barriers. We are fortunate in the Americas that we have already achieved considerable success in this regard, but we should not ignore opportunities for further progress. The European Recovery Program requires supplies from many countries in the Western Hemisphere. This move will stimulate production and commerce and promote the establishment of a world trade on which our prosperity depends."

### 確定樂觀信念　應付共黨策略

Truman criticized the European atmosphere surrounding the Marshall Plan, saying: "We should not ignore the fact that the Communist Party has already declared its determination to oppose all efforts to revive Europe. Strikes will inevitably occur in the future, not to alleviate the difficulties of a certain group, but to create chaos, hoping to achieve totalitarian control. On the contrary, if faith and optimism can be established early, a spark can start a prairie fire, and the progress of European recovery can be greatly accelerated."

### 美與歐洲·貿易差額　今後四年內將逾二百億

[United Press, Washington, 19th] At the same time as President Truman delivered his message, the US State Department also released a report estimating that the trade deficit between Europe and the Western Hemisphere from April 1, 1948, to June 30, 1952, would reach $19.4 billion to $22.1 billion. The report said that in order to make up for this deficit, President Truman will ask Congress to provide $17 billion in aid to Europe, and the remaining shortfall will be made up by increasing loans from the Export-Import Bank and the World Bank, as well as contributions from other countries in the Western Hemisphere. The State Department's report said that in the 15 months starting from April 1 of next year, Huanzhou is expected to obtain 5.2 million tons of bread grains, 800,000 tons of coarse grains, 200,000 tons of fats and oils, 400,000 tons of meat, 700,000 tons of sugar, 150,000 tons of dairy products, 5,000 tons of dried fruits, and 3,000 tons of nitrogen from the United States.

After Madame Chiang delivered her address, Chairman Fang delivered a speech and expressed his gratitude to Madame Chiang on behalf of everyone. Then, accompanied by Mayor Wu and others, she visited the new recruits' barracks. Madame Chiang expressed great sympathy for the soldiers' austere living conditions.

Before going to the reception center, Madame Chiang had already instructed Director-General Huang to prepare a packet of peanut candy, sesame candy, a bar of soap, and three liang of pork for each person, which were distributed immediately after the meeting.

After leaving the reception center, she also visited the Army Hospital. Madame Chiang carefully inspected everything inside the hospital, including the wards and the kitchen, and gave instructions.

### Warehouse Inspection Difficult, Director Wu of the Social Affairs Bureau Advocates Automatic Inventory Registration and Spot Checks

[Report from our newspaper] The authorities previously intended to inspect warehouses throughout the city to stabilize prices and prevent non-businesspeople from hoarding goods. Director Wu Kaixian of the Social Affairs Bureau told reporters yesterday that he believes that if this measure is not handled properly, it will have adverse consequences and cause materials to evade inspection. There are many warehouses in this city, and the issuance and receipt of goods must be suspended during the inspection period. A three-day suspension will not have a major impact, but a one-week suspension will freeze the materials and stimulate prices. Moreover, during the implementation of the inspection, it is difficult to guarantee that there will be no lawless personnel who extort money. There are so many warehouses in this city that even if all the people the municipal government can mobilize are sent, it may take a month to complete the inspection. Therefore, Director Wu believes that the implementation of warehouse inspection has many difficulties and it is more reasonable to implement a method of automatic inventory registration and spot checks. His opinion will be submitted to the Economic Council for discussion.

### Prosecutor's Indictment Lists Five Reasons for Corruption Case of UNRRA Officials

[Report from this Newspaper] In the UNRRA senior official corruption case, Hou Aichang, Director of the UNRRA Logistics Division and General Manager of the Material Purchasing and Sales Department of the Finance Bureau; Dong Chengdao, Director of the UNRRA Finance Bureau; Tao Jingyuan, Section Chief of the Document Section of the UNRRA Finance Bureau; Deng Zhonghe, General Manager of Anle Textile Company; Hu Keshi, former Director of the UNRRA General Affairs Department; Jiang Renlin, former Section Chief of the Welfare Section of the UNRRA General Affairs Department; Huo Yongzhang, Specialist of the UNRRA General Affairs Department; Chen Chao-min, Specialist of the UNRRA General Affairs Department; Chen Jiaju, Specialist of the UNRRA Auditing Office; Du Cen, Deputy Chief Auditor of UNRRA; Ding Tiansheng of the United Shengji Construction Factory; and Pang Yuanlong, Chief of the UNRRA Welfare Section, have been indicted by the District Prosecutor's Office. The original indictment is very long. The following is an excerpt of its main points:

Sale of Electric Fans

Regarding the fraudulent sale of electric fans, Hou Aichang was the General Manager of the Material Purchasing and Sales Department. The UNRRA assigned to the Finance Bureau in February, May, and June 1947, two thousand and forty-one boxes and five thousand and seventy-five electric fans to be sold. On May 19, 1947, it was advertised for sale by tender. Zheng Yi Trading Company won the bid at 356,000 yuan per fan. Subsequently, it was advertised for sale again in May and June. Because no one bid, a total of one thousand and four fans were sold by Chen Xu in small quantities. In July, it was advertised for open retail sale at 400,000 yuan per fan. At that time, the market price was 800,000 to 900,000 yuan per fan. There were many applicants. Hou colluded with Tao Jingyuan, Section Chief of the Document Section of the Finance Bureau, to suppress more than 500 application letters from various agencies and organizations after July 4, and sold a total of 4,295 fans in July and August, profiting from it. This has been verified by the Jiangsu Supervisory Commissioner's Office after sending personnel to audit the accounts.

American Cotton for Yarn

Regarding the fraudulent exchange of American cotton for yarn, the Allied Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) China Bureau's Cotton Yarn Department investigated and determined that the ratio should be 670 pounds of American cotton for 400 pounds of 20-count yarn. Hou, in collusion with Dong Chengdao, Director of the Finance Bureau, used the excuse that cotton was slippery to store and that insurance was a problem. They signed a contract with Yuzhong and 25 other yarn factories, exchanging 760 pounds of American cotton for 400 pounds of 20-count yarn. This resulted in a loss of 90 pounds of cotton for every 760 pounds of cotton from UNRRA. Subsequently, after the Bureau announced the exchange ratio, other manufacturers requested to exchange according to the same standard. Hou and others refused to allow it, and wanted to exchange 670 pounds of American cotton for 400 pounds of 20-count yarn, as testified clearly by Zhang Lisheng, Managing Director of the Shanghai Yarn Trade Association, and Wang Hongsun, Manager of the China Cloth Company.

Sale of Wool

Regarding the fraudulent sale of wool, Hou and Dong colluded and, without going through bidding procedures, entered into contracts with Deng Zhonghe, General Manager of Shanghai Anle Textile Company, in April, September, October, December 1946 and January and February 1947, selling 1.17 million pounds of wool to Anle Company. Deng Zhonghe, the General Manager of the company, gave Hou Aichang an apartment building at No. 1396 Yuyuan Road for his residence, as a reward. According to the defendants Hou Aichang and Deng Zhonghe, although they did not admit to giving or receiving the house, Deng claimed that "the house was sublet to him by Hou's relative Wu Zhiwei" and presented a letter from Wu Zhiwei to Deng Zhonghe dated June 15, 1946, and a business card from Deng Zhonghe to Wu Zhiwei, as proof. The letter was not delivered by the post office, and the paper and ink were new, indicating that it was not an old letter written in June 1946. The business card was written in pencil, making it impossible to verify. It is evident that the letter and business card were fabricated by the defendants Hou and Deng after the fact.

Embezzlement of Public Property

Regarding Hu Keshi, Jiang Renlin, Huo Yongzhang, Chen Zhoumin, Lu Jiaju, Du Cen, and others purchasing furniture, repairing houses, engaging in fraudulent activities, and embezzling public property, when Jiang was the Chief of the Welfare Section, he embezzled 5 million yuan from the section's reserve fund in May 1946, and embezzled 14 valuable tables and chairs from the UNRRA Ruifengli dormitory under his management. He colluded with Huo Yongzhang, a specialist in the General Affairs Department, to privately hire contractor Ding Tiansheng to repair the UNRRA Ruifengli dormitory, and colluded with Chen Tianmin, a specialist, to purchase furniture from Jinchangxiang Zhiji and Huasheng Hao for personal gain. Du Cen and Lu Jiaju, as the Deputy Chief Auditor and Specialist of the Auditing Office of the Bureau, did not follow the Bureau's auditing procedures when approving the above reimbursements, and signed that the furniture had been used by the Bureau, without the need for auditing. There is a suspicion of collusion and fraud.

Electric Appliances and Refrigerators

Regarding Pang Yuanlong's management of welfare fraud, Pang was originally a specialist in the Bureau. After Jiang Renlin left his position, he was appointed Chief of the Welfare Section. He took the opportunity to take possession of an electric appliance and a refrigerator in the UNRRA Ruifengli dormitory.

In summary, according to Article 30, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law, the defendant Jiang Jingyuan and the defendants Hou Aichang and Dong Chengdao are suspected of violating Article 3, Paragraph 6 of the Statute on Punishment of Corruption. In addition to being suspected of violating Article 30, Paragraph 1 of the same law and Article 2, Paragraph 7 of the same Statute together with the defendant Hou Aichang, the defendant Dong Chengdao and the defendant Hou Aichang should be punished according to Article 56 of the same Statute. The defendant Ding Tiansheng is suspected of violating Article 1, Paragraph 1, Subparagraph 2 of the same Statute, and the defendants Hu Keshi, Jiang Renlin, Shi Yongzhang, and Chen Tianmin are suspected of violating Article 3, Paragraph 6 of the same Statute. The defendants Du Cen and Lu Jiaju are suspected of violating Article 9 of the same Statute. The defendant Deng Zhonghe is suspected of violating Article 122, Paragraph 3 of the same Statute. A public prosecution is filed in accordance with Article 1, Paragraph 1 of the Special Statute on Criminal Cases and Article 230, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law.

### Another Case of Malfeasance Involving UNRRA Officials

[Report from This Newspaper] Lan Chunchi, a specialist at UNRRA, has been found to have engaged in fraud by privately selling trucks using his position for personal gain. The case has been investigated and confirmed by the bureau, and was yesterday transferred to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation. While Lan was serving as the chairman of the Automobile Allocation Review Committee of the bureau, the "Fujian Fu Pu Xian Automobile Transportation Company" applied for the allocation of trucks on December 24 of last year. The Shanghai communication address Zhongzheng West Road 1100 listed on the application was found to be the home of Lan's brother. Furthermore, the application had not been registered and numbered by the receiving and dispatching office before Lan submitted it to the seventh meeting on December 27 of last year and got approval for the allocation of two new trucks. After the trucks were purchased, they were parked at the home of Lan's brother. One of the trucks was later resold to China National Aviation Corporation through the introduction of the Maochang Company for 128,650,000 yuan (the original allocated price was 23,650,000 yuan per truck). After the case was reported, UNRRA and UNRRA both launched investigations, but Lan avoided meeting them by feigning illness.

### Zhejiang Agricultural Development is Advancing - After the Provincial Administrative Conference

[Report from this Newspaper, Hangzhou, 18th] Although Zhejiang Province can be considered relatively stable amidst the turmoil in Jiangxi, it is not easy to focus on development. Since Mr. Shen Chengchang took office as provincial governor, he has convened two administrative conferences. The first was in the early autumn of 1946, and the second was in December of 1947. Reviewing the achievements of the first administrative conference, we find that, in addition to progress in governance, transportation, and education, the arbitrary levies and requisitions have indeed been abolished.

Qianjiang Seawall Project

The first phase has indeed been completed. In the Cao'e River basin, ten flood control projects have indeed been completed. In the Pujiang River basin, twelve flood control projects have indeed been completed. In the Donglaoxi River basin, fifteen dikes have been repaired and 142 culverts have been repaired. In the Xizhaohan River basin, eight dredging projects have been completed. In terms of large-scale agricultural water conservancy projects, the first and second phases of the Ningbo Dongqian Lake project have indeed been completed on schedule. The Ninghai Army Port project has completed a three-hole sluice gate and over 50,000 cubic meters of river diversion earthwork. Fifty-five counties have undertaken small-scale agricultural water conservancy projects, totaling 628 projects. Although much of this was thanks to the flour provided by UNRRA, it still required the efforts of government officials for the many tons of flour to be used efficiently for labor relief. Zhejiang is undoubtedly an agricultural province, so we especially highlight the completion of water conservancy projects, which can be said to show that the government authorities have grasped the key points. However, many agricultural problems remain in Zhejiang, such as the improvement of agricultural tools, the improvement of animal husbandry, the reclamation of wasteland, further research on agricultural specialties, and the widespread introduction of improved crop seeds, all of which are extremely important tasks. Doing anything requires both money and people, with people being the most important. Today, agriculture in Zhejiang should focus on people, so more specialized agricultural, forestry, and water conservancy talents should be recruited and trained and assigned to various counties for application. We have seen that Chairman Shen, in his instructions to the screening committee of the 1947 Provincial Administrative Conference on important related issues, specifically mentioned that the salaries of specialized agricultural, forestry, and water conservancy talents will be specially increased, which can be said to be a way to build Zhejiang agriculture by

Nurturing Wealth and Using Talent.

If agriculture in Zhejiang has made significant progress, then wealth will be even more abundant. With abundant wealth, there will be no reason for bandits to arise, and no reason for corruption and malfeasance to occur. Education will flourish, and the people will be able to live and work in peace. Therefore, the only active and important policy for Zhejiang today should be construction, and the most important aspect of construction should be the improvement and development of agriculture. The result of the 1946 Provincial Administrative Conference was the abolition of arbitrary levies and requisitions as a negative aspect, and the construction of several agricultural water conservancy projects as a positive aspect. We also eagerly hope that the result of the 1947 Administrative Conference will be that no civil servant in the province will be corrupt or engage in malfeasance as a negative aspect, and that the province's grain production will increase significantly, the province's specialty products will be greatly improved, and agricultural tools will reach the level of modernization as a positive aspect.

The reporter always believes that, in the current situation where agriculture is the foundation of Zhejiang Province, all levels of schools should especially strengthen the inculcation of agricultural knowledge, and at the same time have a particularly clear understanding of their own hometowns. We eagerly hope that the government will assign cadres to the villages to work together on rural construction, and hold regular competitions to observe their achievements. Another important issue regarding agricultural development is the

Support of Owner-Cultivators.

The government's current implementation of the 25% rent reduction has had some effect in several counties, but it has still not been fully implemented in many places. We should count the wasteland in the whole county, encourage reclamation, and at the same time use the power of the government to especially reward owner-cultivators, so that owner-cultivators can gradually increase in number and truly achieve equal land rights. However, this work also requires those in power to personally go to the countryside and contact the farmers in order to achieve results.

I believe that in today's turbulent times, our Zhejiang needs to achieve stability amidst the turmoil, and

Construction Amidst Stability.

This is certainly not an easy task, but we only need to think about what the unit of stability is. Of course, it cannot be separated from the people. In Zhejiang, more than 80% of the people are farmers. As long as we stabilize the rural areas, everything will be fine.

The 1946 Provincial Administrative Conference has already revealed the bright future of Zhejiang's agricultural development. After the 1947 Provincial Administrative Conference, we hope that under the leadership of Chairman Shen, the development of agriculture in Zhejiang Province will be pushed forward by hundreds and thousands of steps.

### Strong Clan Mentality Prevents Resolution of Disputes in Dan County

[Aboard from Haikou, Hainan Island, 16th] Clan feuds have plagued Dan County, Hainan Island, for decades, often turning villages into ruins, and leading to the humiliation and murder of wives and scholars, and mutual killings. Despite repeated exhortations and dissuasion by local administrative authorities, the deep-seated prejudices persist and the trend has not been curbed. Recently, residents of the county residing in Haikou held a special symposium to discuss solutions, and formulated four concrete measures for adoption by Commissioner Han Hanying. To understand the cause of clan feuds, our reporter visited certain individuals, who said: The clan feuds in the county have reached a state of

Deep Rootedness

to the extent that they cannot be eliminated overnight. The matter of clan feuds has a long history, dating back to the late Qing Dynasty. Wang, from Shajing Village, obtained the status of Jinshi and then ran rampant in the countryside, relying on his power to humiliate the villagers, arbitrarily seizing fertile fields, and forcibly taking women. The people hated him to the core. Wu, a Bagong from Tangdi Village, a neighboring village, witnessed Wang's rampant power and rose up to speak out against injustice, and reported the matter to Li Xi, the then magistrate. Magistrate Li summoned both parties for trial, but Wang

Roared in Court

angering the magistrate, who then charged Wang with ten major crimes and executed him in the market in Dan. From then on, the Wu and Wang clans formed a deep-seated hatred, leading to fierce clan feuds. Later, due to the advantageous conditions of geographical environment and kinship, each formed

### Li Shumei, Logistics Officer of Tongshan Garrison District, Apprehended After Fleeing

[Report from this Newspaper, Suzhou, 19th] Li Shumei, a first-class logistics officer of the Tongshan Garrison District Headquarters of the Northern Jiangsu Garrison District, was recently dismissed from his position for some reason. However, Li refused to hand over his duties and seized the opportunity to flee. Today, he was apprehended by the Criminal Investigation Team of the County Police Bureau based on a tip-off. Li admitted to fleeing without hesitation. The Police Bureau has telegraphed the Tongshan Garrison District to send personnel to Suzhou to escort him back for trial. Parties, each establishing a separate faction to oppose each other, involving eighteen surnames such as Wu, Chen, Li, and He, against twenty-four surnames such as Wang, Li, Fu, Tang, Sun, and Yang. The clan feuds escalated and became uncontrollable. It was not until 1928 that both sides suffered heavy losses and their vitality was greatly reduced that the matter subsided slightly. In 1932, the Chen and He surnames in Shenque Pit fought again over stones and wood. Because the mediator's mediation was ineffective, the Chen clan leader was shot and executed, thus causing a new generation of feuds between the Chen and He families. In 1935, the Chen and Wu surnames in Sandu territory also fought over stones. Before the enemy landed, there was another clan feud between the Chen and Yang surnames in Sandu territory. After the victory, for various complex reasons, the two sides failed to

Overcome Prejudices.

Some even used the opportunity to scheme and attack each other, resulting in the clan feud wind never being lessened. In short, although the clan feuds in Dan County have various causes, the strong clan mentality and strong feudal colors of the general public, which prevents the two sides from overcoming old grievances and forming new friendships, is the biggest factor.

### Our Country Does Not Plan to Participate in Activities of the World Student Union; Student Unions of Finland and Norway Will Not Attend Next Meeting

[Dispatch from Nanking, 19th of this Month] Ministry of Education reports: Our country does not plan to participate in any future activities of the World Student Union. The situation with the World Student Union headquarters in Prague is extremely complex. Since the World Youth Festival this summer, the true nature of the Union has become increasingly clear. According to the November 7th commentary in the Czech Social Democratic Party newspaper, Free Word, the Union is part of a communist international organization. This fact is known not only to students but also to officials in various countries. The Union excludes organizations that it finds inconvenient, such as the Chinese Student Association, in order to include organizations from so-called "liberated areas" in China. Similarly, it allows only a student union organized by communists, representing only one-fifth of all Italian students, to join on behalf of Italy. The commentary continues: Unless the Union changes its current political views, student unions from Finland, Norway, Denmark, Belgium, Sweden, Scotland, and New Zealand will not attend the next meeting.

Schools will be required to schedule teachers to be responsible for guiding students' self-study, so that students can fully digest the material taught each day. Furthermore, day students will be strictly prohibited from returning home on their own after regular classes. The afternoon meeting continued until the evening, and the curriculum standards for natural history, physiology, hygiene, and history were discussed and finalized. The meeting will continue on the 20th.

### Hu Shih Arrived in Peiping Yesterday

[Dispatch from Peiping, 19th of this Month] Hu Shih returned to Peiping from Shanghai at 1:00 p.m. today. Mr. Hu expressed admiration for the establishment of the Sino-American Education Fund Board, believing that the United States' passage of this farsighted bill would make a significant contribution to promoting Sino-American friendship. While Chinese schools in general would benefit, those receiving special assistance, such as Peking Union Medical College and various mission schools, would continue to benefit the Chinese people, which is only right and proper. Mr. Hu also mentioned that during his trip south, he appealed to Peking University alumni in Peking on the 11th to donate funds for the construction of a grand auditorium and museum at Peking University, totaling 77 billion yuan. The auditorium accounts for 37.9 billion yuan, which should not be a problem. Regarding the recent negotiations by northern professors to peg their salaries to an index with the central government, Mr. Hu said that he had not had the chance to meet with the responsible officials due to their busy schedules.

He also expressed gratitude for the scholarships donated to the various schools by all sectors of the city.

Fang Xikong Stated Yesterday That Party Groups Have Withdrawn From Schools

Chairman Fang stated in his address that it is unreasonable that school administrators today are busy with school economic problems and trivial matters. Local authorities are eager to assist schools in solving difficulties, as exemplified by the current fundraising for scholarships. Mr. Fang continued that since the consolidation of Party groups, they have completely withdrawn from schools. He hoped that in the future, teachers and students in various schools would prioritize academic research over political activities, in order to cultivate talent for the country. He also hoped that schools would establish expanded lectures to benefit the general public. As for extracurricular activities in each school, he hoped that they would also be strengthened. Zhu Jingnong, president of Guanghua University, said that implementing democracy begins with elections. Given the cold reception to the National Assembly elections last month, university groups cannot sit idly by. Legislative elections are especially important because they relate to national legislation. He heard that five candidates for legislative representatives from university groups nationwide were designated by the central government, and Ou Yuanhuai, president of Daxia University, was the only designated candidate in this city. He hoped that universities in the East China region would assist Mr. Ou's campaign in order to seek benefits for university groups. The entire audience expressed their willingness to support him.

Participating in Public Memorial for Li Denghui

Afterward, the following resolutions were passed after discussion: The late Li Denghui, former president of Fudan University, was a master of the education world, not only benefiting Fudan students but also widely respected by the nation. It was decided that everyone would participate in Mr. Li's public memorial tomorrow and that the Federation would present a plaque with the inscription "A Model Teacher for Generations" to express their admiration. The Scholarship Unified Review Committee expressed its gratitude to the municipal authorities and the various donating organizations, and offered two points based on their experiences handling scholarships this semester: (A) Please issue scholarships earlier in the future, so that the recipients can truly benefit. (B) Please announce the methods for scholarships with attached conditions as soon as possible, in order to fulfill them and achieve the desired effect. The issue of tuition fees for private schools next semester will be discussed at the next meeting. In order to strengthen extracurricular activities in each school, in addition to the original Sports Committee, a Speech and Debate Committee will be established, with Fudan, Shanghai, Shanghai Business School, Shanghai Law School, and Lixin Five Schools as members, with Fudan as the convener. The Academic Advancement Committee will consist of Datong, Tongji, Guang, Da, and Political Science and Law College Five Schools, with Datong as the convener. The two committees will draft specific methods and submit them to the next meeting for discussion and implementation. Youth cafeterias have already been established in each school, but the various items that the Bureau of Social Affairs promised to allocate have not yet been distributed, and students are waiting. Zhu Guozhang and Hu Wen will be designated to negotiate with the authorities in charge on Tuesday of the tenth week, in order to open them as soon as possible.

### Summary of the 1947-1948 Basketball New Rules (Continued and Finished)

When jumping the ball in the center circle or on the free-throw line, the other eight non-jumping players should all stand outside the restricted area before the ball is tapped. During the jump ball, teammates may not stand side by side in the restricted area (unless the opposing team does not need to occupy one of the positions in the location where they are standing).

The above rules also apply to jump balls that are not performed within the restricted area, except for the assumed restricted area that is a considerable distance from the jumping players. Note of Article 1 of Chapter 7 has been revised and incorporated into Article 2 of Chapter 1.

(Official Note) Article has been shortened because part has been incorporated into Article 5 of Chapter 2. The meaning has not changed. The full text is as follows:

Officials' instructions for announcing out-of-bounds balls should be clear. If a player has doubts about the judgment, the official should take the ball away and wait for the judgment to be understood before proceeding to throw the ball. (Refer to Article 5 of Chapter 2 for the rules on handing the ball to the player with the right to throw it).

Article 5 of Chapter 8 adds a "Special Case" section to conform to the old rule using "the center circle jump ball method to begin each half or each decisive period of the game." The full sentence is as follows:

(Special Case) If a foul in the first item occurs before the beginning of each half or each decisive period, then after the free throw, a jump ball should be used in the center circle to begin the game.

Article 4 (E) of Chapter 10 is a newly added rule that lists examples of technical fouls. Item (E) in Article 7 of Chapter 4 states that any avoidable physical contact during a stoppage in the game is considered a technical foul against the spirit of sportsmanship. The full sentence is as follows:

(E) Making unnecessary movements that cause physical contact during a stoppage in the game.

The penalty rules in Article 7 of Chapter 10 have been recompiled, but the original meaning has not been changed.

The meaning of "continuous action" in the note has been expanded to include a ball that has been tapped and rebounded, or a legal step during a shot. This provision provides officials with a more definitive basis for judging situations where "an opposing player commits a foul against a player after the ball has left the hand, but the shot should be considered valid if the ball goes in." The full text is as follows:

If an opposing player commits a foul against a player, and that player has already made part of the shooting motion before the foul (including a ball that has been tapped and rebounded or a legal step during a shot), then the shot should be considered valid if the ball goes in, even if the ball leaves the hand after the whistle has blown, as long as the whistle does not affect the game. The player must be continuing or beginning the shooting motion when the whistle blows, but if the timekeeper's signal sounds before the ball enters the air, then the shot is invalid.

Article 8 of Chapter 10 is a new rule that allows a player to waive a free throw after a personal foul. It was previously part of Article 7 of Chapter 10, but the meaning has been changed. The full text is as follows:

When a free throw is awarded for a personal foul, the captain of the free-throwing team may declare that they are waiving the free throw, unless there is another free throw in succession, or a jump ball in the center circle (as in Article 7 of Chapter 8). After waiving the free throw, any player on the team should throw the ball in from the boundary in the center court to continue the game.

### National Bank Requests Prohibition of Cash Flow into Shanghai; Ministry of Finance to Order Customs to Conduct Thorough Inspections

Since the National Bank's order restricting remittances, funds from various places have continued to flow into the city. The methods include: remittances from commercial banks and firms, carrying cash. However, commercial banks and firms are limited in number due to restrictions from the National Bank, so most still transport cash to Shanghai.

It is reported that the amount of cash transported to Shanghai is very large. Unofficial statistics show that it exceeded 300 billion in the week.

Cotton Yarn Remains Firm

Yesterday's cotton yarn market conditions were based on the indecisiveness of monetary tightness, coupled with the increase in the US exchange rate, and people's hearts turned firm, and the intention of all parties to pay was suddenly strong, and the sound of shouting in the court was mostly heard. Forty-two branches of Blue Phoenix fine yarn, once raised to 48 million, then because floating more profit selling, near closing back to 47.6 million, but compared to the day before, it rebounded 2.4 million. The rest of the fine yarn branches also rebounded, from 340,000 to more than 2 million.

Cloth Rises

Cotton cloth market conditions, when the first morning opened, because the floating more overnight to settle, the transaction Qing rare, the line Qing ups and downs very small, how to reach after 10 o'clock, Wen Meijin hanging high, people's hearts turned firm, Tianjin Gang and Shanxi Gang since the absorption, the parties paid the stomach to start, shouting the price of more than the constant. To the result, 12 pounds of dragon head and other fine cloths, soaring 55,000 to 83,000 yuan, in addition to the bleached cloth biji straight tribute coarse cloth fine materials and other market conditions, Beijing Jin rose 230,000 to about 100,000, and the rest of the cloth feet also trended high show.

Textile Construction Sells Yarn

[Our Report] China Textile Construction Company yesterday opened for sale the usual alliance with cotton yarn, a total of 895 pieces, combined with 20 yarn 1646 pieces, the application list a total of 318 strong, the allocation price is still according to the original price did not move.

### Pre-War Deposit Refund Multiples: The Financial Industry Requests a Speedy Review and Approval; The Technicalities of the Special Business Tax Collection Will Be Appropriately Improved

[Our Report] Regarding the issue of the multiples for the refund of pre-war deposits, although the Executive Yuan has previously passed a draft handling method, which has been set at 1,700 times, it still requires the Legislative Yuan to complete the legislative process before it can be formally implemented. It is now reported that the Legislative Yuan may temporarily shelve this case due to the impending reorganization. The financial industry in this city believes that it is not convenient to postpone this case indefinitely, and has specially requested the Chairman of the Bankers Association, Li Fuxun, to go to Beijing a few days ago to urge a speedy review, approval, and implementation.

Also, the issue of reducing the special business tax for the silver industry is now impossible. However, it is reported that the collection techniques may be appropriately improved. Currently, the silver industry has three opinions on improving the collection techniques: 1) Calculate the standard based on interest income plus fee income, minus interest expense plus fee expense. 2) The special business tax for branches and sub-branches should be submitted by the head office. Currently, the special tax for various banks and firms in Shanghai is calculated from July of this year. Other regions are calculated from May. 3) Each silver firm should submit a monthly report to the Ministry of Finance, and request that the special tax payable be calculated based on the monthly report, without further account verification. It is reported that the authorities are expected to accept the first two opinions, but the third opinion is unlikely to be accepted. The special tax for the second half of the 36th year for various banks and firms in this city will be levied from July 1st to December 31st. It is now scheduled to begin filing on January 10th of next year. It is estimated that the largest commercial bank will have to pay approximately 1.1 billion in special taxes. It is expected that the total special tax payable by the banking industry in the city will be approximately 30 billion yuan.

History and Literature

### On Buddhism and Translated Literature (Part 1)

— Zhou Yiliang

In the Biography of Kumarajiva in Volume 2 of the Biographies of Eminent Monks in the Liang Dynasty, it is recorded that this great translator of scriptures in the Yao Qin era commented on translation, saying, "Changing Sanskrit to Chinese loses its elegance. Although the general meaning is obtained, the literary style is very different. It is like chewing food for others, which not only loses the flavor, but also makes one vomit." Even a master translator like Kumarajiva said this. If we want to study translated Buddhist scriptures from a literary point of view, aren't we trying to find flavor in food that someone else has chewed? Strictly speaking, of course, no translated work can replace the original. However, the translation of Buddhist scriptures in China lasted for more than a thousand years from the Later Han Dynasty to the Northern Song Dynasty. So many people participated, and the content of the translated scriptures was so broad. At the same time, the original versions of these classics are now extremely rare, relying entirely on the translated versions to be circulated. In no other language in the world is there probably such a collection of translated literature! Even though it is food that has been chewed, there is still value in re-chewing it, that is without a doubt.

Chinese scholars have always disdained to look at the books of "heretics" and "two clans." The Qing Dynasty historian Qian Daxin, whose learning can be described as profound and extensive, made a very serious mistake in his postscript to the inscriptions on metal and stone in the Qianyan Hall, in which he examined the establishment years of the Tang Dynasty's official in charge of repairing meritorious deeds in the monasteries of the capital, because he did not refer to the records of Buddhists. This is a very good example. In recent decades, the academic atmosphere has undergone a tremendous change. On the one hand, many new materials have been discovered, and on the other hand, materials that were not noticed by predecessors have also been used. Those who discuss Buddhist philosophy and Buddhist history certainly have to look at the Tripitaka, and even scholars who study history or Sino-Western communication have obtained many useful materials from Buddhist writings. Only those who study literature or literary history have not been able to fully utilize translated Buddhist scriptures, and that is what this article wants to discuss.

Mr. Hu Shih, in his History of Vernacular Literature, once devoted a special section to discussing translated Buddhist literature and gave examples to illustrate his point, which can be described as uniquely insightful. Shen Congwen's collection of short stories, "Moonlight Scenery", and Su Xuelin's play, "Kunnara's Eyes", as well as the late Xu Dishan's several short stories, are all taken from translated Buddhist scriptures and are very successful. All can be described as the sound of footsteps in an empty valley. I now want to look at translated Buddhist literature from three perspectives.

The first is to treat it as pure literature. For example, the parable of the burning house in the Lotus Sutra is an extremely beautiful literary work in the original text, and Kumarajiva's translation is also quite sufficient to convey the emotion of the original text. As in the narrative of the fire: "Later, the house suddenly caught fire. The flames blazed on all sides at once. The sound of the beams and pillars cracking shook the ground. They collapsed and fell, and the walls collapsed. All the ghosts and gods shouted loudly. The vultures, crows, and kumbhandas of Liju were in a state of confusion and panic, unable to get out. Evil beasts and poisonous insects hid in holes." It is written in a way that conveys the meaning of a raging fire. Asvaghosa's Buddhacarita is a poem narrating the life of Buddha, and half of the original text still exists. It is also one of the best works in the history of Sanskrit literature. The translator is now generally considered to be Dharmaraksa, a monk from Central India who came east during the Northern Liang Dynasty, but there are still some questions, which will not be discussed here. This translation is not as faithful or literary as Kumarajiva's, but it is not impossible to glimpse the literary meaning of the original text. For example, the chapter "Contemplation of Disgust" describes how the king had to allow the prince to go out for a trip, but was afraid that he would see old age, sickness, ugliness, and filth and develop a sense of disgust and detachment: "When the king saw the prince arrive, he stroked his head and looked at his face. His feelings of sorrow and joy were intertwined, and he allowed him to go with his mouth, but kept him in his heart." It is written in great detail. It's just that "stroked his head" in the original text is Sirasyupa-gliraya, which originally refers to a type of Indian etiquette involving both smelling and kissing. The translation was adapted to suit the Chinese national conditions, and therefore it was translated as "stroked his head" instead of "smelled his head." Again, the chapter "Sorrow and Grief of the Whole Palace" describes how the prince entered the mountains to cultivate the Tao, and the charioteer Chandaka and the white horse returned. The prince's wife, Yasodhara, blamed the charioteer Chandaka, saying: "The one I admired is dead. Where is he now? The man and the horse went together, but now only two have returned! My heart is extremely frightened, trembling and uneasy. You are ultimately an unjust person, not intimate, not a good friend, not auspicious, even if strong! What is the use of weeping? To take him away and then return weeping is completely inconsistent! ... Therefore, the holy prince has gone and will never return. You should be very happy now, for your evil deeds have been accomplished. It is better to be close to wise enemies than to associate with foolish friends. You are nominally a good friend, but in reality, you harbor resentment! Today, this superior artisan's home has been completely destroyed in one day!" Although it is not as smooth as the original text, it is sufficient to express the spicy tone of a woman. "The one I admired is dead" is based on the Korean Tripitaka. The three versions of the Song, Yuan, and Ming Dynasties all say "the one in my heart." According to the original text, what is similar to this sentence is Gatah kvasa chandaka manmanorathah. Meaning, "Chandaka, where is the one who pleases my heart?" The "one in my heart" of the three versions of the Song, Yuan, and Ming Dynasties may be closer to the truth than "the one I admired."

The two examples cited above happen to be originals that still exist. There are also originals that no longer exist, and we can only appreciate them through translated versions. The Fo Benxing Jing translated by Bao Yun of the Liu Song Dynasty can be used as a representative. This is also a biography of the Buddha. The chapter "Dwelling with the Maidens" describes how the prince's wife had a dream at night, in which she dreamed that the prince had abandoned her and gone into the mountains and forests. She "chased and called out incessantly, and the prince entered the forest. Her mind became frantic, and she sought him tree by tree. She howled to the trees, saying: 'You alone have no worries, but I alone am troubled! Show me the prince!' She looked up and saw a red-beaked bird on the tree. She complained to the bird: 'I have lost my protector. Your voice resembles his. I will give you my voice! May your cry remove the sorrow from my heart!' She also saw the tree, saying: 'Why are you not compassionate? I am in distress and have lost my protector. I am lost and have committed offenses. I have been abandoned by my virtuous husband. You should show me comfort and sorrow. Why do I see the lotus? Why don't the flowers bloom?' ...Moved by the wind, the branches of the tree bent down. 'It is as if I am being beaten with a stick!' The birds and beasts looked at her: 'You did not send your husband away!' The sound of the water was like scolding: 'I am not able to cure the prince and he will not return!' Then she cried and rejoiced, saying: 'Leave your eyes like blue lotuses... Leave the flowering lotus, leave your golden face, leave your hair to ward off soldiers. I saw him abandon me!' Before she finished speaking, she suddenly saw the prince among the trees in the forest. She went forward and grabbed him, saying: 'Why did you abandon me?' After speaking, she woke up with a start, holding the prince, ashamed, fearful, and trembling." There are several sentences in this passage that are quite difficult to understand. Before we find a better version to correct the errors, or suitable materials to explain them, we can only suspend our judgment. However, judging from the parts that we can understand, this passage is already very poetic and full of fantasy. Sanskrit literature is very fond of using puns. Here, "no worries" must be Asoka in the original text, which is the name of a tree, and also has the meaning of "no worries." "Leave your eyes" and so on means that after the prince left, he left a souvenir for others, which they could use to remember him, but only she had not received anything. "Golden flower" refers to the flower of the Asoka tree. One of the thirty-two marks of Shakyamuni is that his "skin is soft, smooth, and the color of purple polished gold," which is why "leave your golden face." The so-called "ward off soldiers" may be the "ward off soldiers silk" mentioned in books such as the Customs Records of Jingchu. This is naturally using inherent Chinese objects to compare with Western objects, such as the way Yijing used willow branches to translate Dantakastha. But I have not been able to determine what the original text is, maybe it is the sash worn by Brahmins? The above are just a few random examples. There are certainly many more chapters with literary meaning that can be found in Buddhist scriptures. In the future, those who compile literary history, at least those who write the history of medieval literature, will certainly give translated Buddhist literature an important place, right?

### Discussion on the "Western Continent Song"

— You Guoen

In the "Yuefu" poetry collection, there is a song called "Western Continent Song," titled "Ancient Lyrics." Some believe it was written by Emperor Wu of Liang, while others attribute it to Jiang Yan, but both are incorrect. It is a genuine folk song from the Jiangnan region, and no scholar of the Six Dynasties could have composed a single phrase of it. Not only is its style beyond the imitation of scholars, but considering just the ten characters "Raise the curtain, the sky is high; the sea sways, empty and green," even people of the High Tang Dynasty probably couldn't imitate it. How could authors of the Six Dynasties have dreamed of it?

However, I don't want to discuss the authorship of the "Western Continent Song" right now. What I want to raise is a problem that is most easily overlooked by general readers of such popular folk songs, a problem that even poses a challenge to interpretation. Let me first transcribe the full text of the song lyrics below:

"Remember picking plums below the Western Continent, breaking off plum blossoms to send to the north of the river. Wearing a thin apricot-red shirt, her hair as black as a crow's young. Where is the Western Continent? It's at the ferry beyond Double-Punting Bridge. At dusk, the shrike flies, the wind blows the Chinese tallow tree. Under the tree is the doorway, in the doorway gleams a jade hairpin. Opening the door, my love doesn't arrive; going out to pick red lotuses. Picking lotuses in the southern pond in autumn, the lotus flowers taller than a person's head. Lowering her head to play with lotus seeds, the lotus seeds clear as water. Placing the lotus seeds in her sleeve, her thoughts are thoroughly red. Remembering my love, my love doesn't arrive, raising her head to watch the flying geese. Geese fly all over the Western Continent, hoping my love will ascend the green tower; from the tower, he can't be seen, all day at the railing. The railing has twelve bends, her dangling hands bright as jade. Raise the curtain, the sky is high; the sea sways, empty and green. The sea in my dreams stretches on and on, your sorrow is also my sorrow. The south wind knows my heart, may it blow my dream to the Western Continent." I want to ask first:

(1) Are the opening two lines in the woman's tone or the man's tone?

(2) Is the female protagonist's home—the Western Continent—north or south of the river?

(3) If it is in Jiangnan, then how should the final two lines, "The south wind knows my heart, may it blow my dream to the Western Continent," be interpreted?

(4) If it is north of the river, then how should those two lines be interpreted?

(5) Whose tone are the four lines from "The sea in my dreams stretches on and on" onwards?

(6) If it is the man's tone, then the man is in Jiangnan, while the woman is in the north of the river.

(7) If it is the woman's tone, doesn't it clearly mean that the woman is in Jiangnan, and the man is north of the river? In this case, the Western Continent becomes the man's home. All these questions must have correct answers before this poem can be understood and avoid being self-contradictory.

The most difficult parts of this poem to explain are the opening two lines and the concluding four lines. The opening two lines say, "Remember picking plums below the Western Continent, breaking off plum blossoms to send to the north of the river." Whose tone is this? I believe it is naturally the man's tone. He should be saying: I (the man) am now thinking of you (the woman), and I really want to come to the Western Continent to see you. And you, coincidentally, sent a plum blossom to express my longing. How fitting! The "remembering plums" in the first line is the man's doing, and the "sending plums" in the next line is the woman's doing. The first line is from the man's perspective, and the second line is from the woman's perspective. So I thought of something: these two "plum" characters are definitely not used casually. The "plum" character is very likely the woman's given name or surname. Therefore, when her lover was thinking of her, she immediately sent him a plum blossom so that seeing the object would be like seeing the person. So I assume that remembering plums and sending plums must belong to both the man and the woman, and should not be regarded as a one-sided matter. I think it must be explained in this way for the opening two lines to have meaning; otherwise, both saying "remembering plums" and "sending plums" don't make sense in fact, whether it's the man or the woman.

Since remembering plums and sending plums have been determined to be the affairs of both the man and the woman, it is naturally determined that the woman lives in the Western Continent (and there is even explicit textual evidence in the poem). And the man lives north of the river. Therefore, it is further known that since the man lives north of the river, the Western Continent where the woman lives must be in Jiangnan. Once the residences of both the man and woman and their positions have been clarified, then all the problems of this poem will be largely solved.

It turns out it's like this: a man living north of the river suddenly thinks of his lover, and the horses of consciousness keep circling in his mind. Therefore, this poem starts with a "remembering" character, and from then on, it is always "remembering" what he said. "Wearing a thin apricot-red shirt, her hair as black as a crow's young," is remembering her clothes and appearance. "Where is the Western Continent?" to "in the doorway gleams a jade hairpin" is remembering her doorway and decorations. "Opening the door, my love doesn't arrive" to "all day at the railing" is remembering her life and thoughts, and remembering that she is thinking of her lover at all times. The four lines of "The railing has twelve bends" not only recall the structure of her residence but also recall the scenery of that residence. The two lines "Raise the curtain, the sky is high; the sea sways, empty and green" combined with the two lines above, "From the tower, he can't be seen, all day at the railing," have the divine taste of "The song ends, but the person is not seen; on the river, several peaks are green." Liu Zihou's "Leisurely, it is with the vast Qi, and there is no end; Boundless, it travels with the Creator, and does not know its limit," seems to be in the same realm, truly a divine product in poetry. Since the poem started with "plum," and the plum is a flower of winter and spring, it "remembers" in order according to the seasons of the year. Thus, going out to pick lotuses and placing them in her sleeve, and thus, looking up at the flying geese and climbing the tower to look around. Because picking lotuses is a matter of summer and autumn (of course, there are also songs like "Midnight Song" using "lotus" as a homophone for "cherish"), and flying geese are only available in autumn and winter (of course, there is also the meaning of looking forward to news and wanting to fly away like a swan). "Southern pond in autumn" clearly points out the season, and the two characters "sky high" also subtly point out the autumn scenery ("The sky is high, and the air is clear" are the words of Song Yu's "Nine Laments" about autumn). You see, he talks about plums, lotuses, and flying geese, thinking from winter and spring to summer and autumn, undoubtedly a four-season longing.

The final four lines, "The sea in my dreams stretches on and on, your sorrow is also my sorrow. The south wind knows my heart, may it blow my dream to the Western Continent," this ending makes me hesitate again. If we continue from the previous text, it is naturally still the man's tone; but the problem lies in the fact that the two characters "south wind" don't make sense. There are very few examples in ancient poems and "Yuefu" songs of addressing a woman as "Jun" (lord/you) is still secondary. Because the man is originally in Jiangbei, and the woman is originally in Jiangnan, logically, it should be said "north wind," why specifically say "south wind"? Saying "south wind" means the man should be in Jiangnan and the woman should be in Jiangbei. This is exactly the opposite of the facts. If it is the woman's tone, naturally the problem of the "Jun" character is solved, but the difficulty of the "south wind" still exists. Because in this way, the woman is indeed in Jiangnan, but the Western Continent is instead in Jiangbei and becomes the man's home, wouldn't that be even more contradictory to what is described in the poem?

How should it be explained to make sense? I think this ending is more correct as the woman's tone. You only need to look at the "also" character in "your sorrow is also my sorrow" to know that the tone has already changed at this point. Because everything written before is nothing more than the man thinking of the woman. He thinks that the woman is in a high tower, gazing intently all day long, not seeing even the shadow of her lover, only seeing the vast sea, the endless green waves swaying in the sky and water connected. Writing to this point, it suddenly changes the tone and adopts the woman's voice:

"Oh, that boundless sea! It is truly as vague as a dream. Longing for each other but unable to meet, you are sorrowful, and how am I not sorrowful too?—But when it comes to "dreams," "dreams" are also good. If the south wind (i.e., the wind blowing southward, actually the north wind) knows my thoughts, it will blow you from your dream to the Western Continent so that we can meet in a dream. Isn't that better than being separated all day and suffering for longing?"

Many "Yuefu" songs use dialogue, often in the form of questions and answers between the two sides. Although this poem is not a direct dialogue, the final four lines are indeed a clear expression made by the woman because the man is thinking of her. Of course, it still has the meaning of dialogue. Such a conclusion makes it even more extraordinary. "Mulberry on the Roadside," "Feathered Forest" and other poems also have the same style. In this way, all problems are solved.

Perhaps some people suspect that the two characters "south wind" cannot be explained in this way. But why doubt this? In the letter that the people of the Six Dynasties attributed to Li Ling answering Su Wu, wasn't there clearly the sentence "Sometimes due to the north wind, I receive your kind words"? Li Ling was in the Xiongnu, and Su Wu was in Chang'an. Logically, it should be said "south wind," but not saying "south wind" and saying "north wind" isn't it often used to mean the wind coming from the north or blowing towards the north?

Finally, if someone asks: "Since the final four lines are in the woman's tone, couldn't the woman also be north of the river?" My answer is still "no." Because in this way, the sentence "sending plums to the north of the river" would be difficult to explain. The poem says "north of the river," clearly implying the location of the man. The juxtaposition of "north of the river" and "Western Continent" clearly indicates two different directions.

### "Archaeology in Gansu"

— Lecture by Dr. Pei Wenzhong, recorded by the History Society of Peking University

I. The Work is a Continuation of the Predecessors'

This time, I went to Gansu to do prehistoric archaeological work under the order of the Central Geological Survey. Starting from Beiping in June this year and returning to Beiping in early November, it lasted about five months. This work is a continuation of the work of Mr. J.G. Andersson twenty years ago. From 1923 to 1924, Mr. An and Mr. Yuan Fuli went to Gansu and Qinghai to conduct prehistoric human surveys. Their footprints reached three areas: the Huanghe River (Xining River) basin, the Tao River basin, and the vicinity of Minqin (Zhenfan). Mr. An divided the prehistoric culture of these three regions into six periods: Qijia period, Yangshao period (Banshan and Majiayao in the Tao River basin), Machang period, Xindian period, Siwa period, and Shajing period. Mr. An believed that the first three periods were the late Neolithic Age, and the latter three periods had reached the Bronze Age. He estimated that the time was about from 2500 to 500 BC. Mr. An also believed that these six periods were continuous and evolved in a single line, divided into six periods due to different times. Mr. An named the culture represented by these six periods "Yangshao Culture." Also, because the pottery used in that period was painted with colorful patterns, it was also known as "Painted Pottery Culture." Mr. An's discoveries and research results aroused worldwide attention. Mr. An has returned to his country for more than 20 years, and we have not been able to continue his unfinished work. This year, Mr. Zhu Taiheng and I went to Gansu. Although there are no achievements to speak of, it can be regarded as that we still intend to continue the work of our predecessors.

During the War of Resistance Against Japan, Mr. Xia Ding of the Academia Sinica and Mr. Huang Wenbi of the Peiping Research Institute did a lot of important archaeological work in the Northwest, but their reports have not been published, so we cannot use them as a reference, which is a pity.

II. A Total of Four Regions Were Traveled

Mr. Zhu Taiheng and I traveled a total of four regions this time: the upper reaches of the Wei River (from Tianshui to Longxi), the Xihan River basin (i.e., the upper reaches of the Jialing River, Chengxian, Lixian, Xihe, etc.), the Tao River basin (Taosha to Lintao), and the Da Xia River basin (Linxia and Ningding County). From these four regions, we discovered more than 90 prehistoric sites of eight categories, among which more than ten should continue to be excavated on a large scale.

(1) Upper Reaches of the Wei River

Mr. Xu Xusheng and Mr. Su Bingqi of the Peiping Research Institute have already done archaeological work in the lower reaches of the Wei River. This time we investigated the upper reaches of the Wei River. The prehistoric culture of this region can be divided into three periods: the early period, which is the "Yangshao period" as Mr. An called it. This is the most prosperous period of painted pottery culture. The application of painted pottery is very extensive, and the production is also exquisite. In the middle period, painted pottery has declined, and the application is less, and the production is also coarser. In the late period, painted pottery will disappear, and occasionally there is painted pottery, and its decorations are also very simple. The reason for the decline of painted pottery culture, I personally think, is because it was directly influenced by "primitive Chinese culture." I don't know the details of what I call "primitive Chinese culture" yet, I only know that it is the culture before the Yin culture.

(2) Xihan River Basin

This area is roughly the same as the upper reaches of the Wei River, but it has a slight local character. From this area, you can know the distribution of painted pottery culture to the south.

(3) Tao River Basin

This area is connected to the upper reaches of the Wei River by Weiyuan. In this area, during the heyday of painted pottery culture, that is, the Yangshao period, the tombs had the "Banshan" area, and the residences had Majiayao and Siwa Mountain. In these many places, the exquisiteness of the production and the wide application of painted pottery are the same as in the upper reaches of the Wei River.

After this period, in the Tao River basin, the painted pottery culture also gradually declined, but not as fast as in the upper reaches of the Wei River. My opinion is that the painted pottery culture declined more slowly because it was less influenced by primitive Chinese culture. The first period of decline is the Machang period as Mr. An called it. However, the Machang period in the Da Xia River and Huang River basins is more developed than in the Tao River basin.

After the Machang period is the Xindian period, which is particularly developed in the Tao River basin. People in this period still used painted pottery, but the production was rough, and it was obvious that the industrial center had shifted to other aspects (such as bronze ware). The culture of this period was also influenced by primitive Chinese culture. For example, the patterns on pottery often have thunder patterns and geometric patterns, which is a clear proof.

### A Discussion with Mr. Lu Jiye on "Arranging the Order of Music"

— Yan Zi'e

The difference between the two versions is so great that Mr. Lu did not make a choice and used them to write a book. This is really inappropriate.

Mr. Lu said that "Arranging the Order of Music" is the origin of "drama lists." This directly regards "Arranging the Order of Music" as a proper noun. I think this is still debatable. Because in "Old Events in Wulin," there is often the word "arrangement"; "Arranging the Order of Music" is only used together once. It can be seen that "arrangement" and "order of music" are not necessarily fixed proper nouns that must be closely linked together, but are independent words. For example,

Dragon Boat Festival entry: "The Academy of Scholars provides posts in advance, such as the arrangements in the palace in spring, using the first day of the lunar month as usual."

Mid-Autumn Festival entry: "The palace has moon-viewing and osmanthus arrangements this evening."

Double Ninth Festival entry: "The palace usually makes arrangements for the Double Ninth Festival on the eighth day."

Opening Furnace entry: "On this day, the Emperor offers sandwiched clothing in front of the palace...until the first day of February next year, the Queen's palace opens the furnace for arrangements..."

Winter Solstice entry: "Great court meetings and celebrations for the Winter Solstice arrangements."

The meaning of "arrangement" in the above entries seems to be an abbreviation of "arranging the scene" as today's people say. The so-called "Heavenly Foundation Holy Festival Arrangement" is the "arrangement" during the "Heavenly Foundation Holy Festival." Music must be played during the "Heavenly Foundation Holy Festival Arrangement," and there is a certain order for playing music, which is the basis for the creation of "order of music." "Arrangement" and "order of music" clearly refer to two different things, and "order of music" is just one item in "arrangement." Grammatically speaking, the easiest mistake to find when linking "arrangement" and "order of music" is that there is no subject before "Arranging the Order of Music." Because this subject is too important: without "Heavenly Foundation Holy Festival" as the subject, or using other subjects, it has not been seen in "Old Events in Wulin." According to the common practice in "Old Events in Wulin," the word "arrangement" should be affixed after "Heavenly Foundation Holy Festival," and "order of music" is an additional explanation of another matter and should not be linked with "arrangement" to become a proper noun.

Since "Arranging the Order of Music" cannot be regarded as a proper noun, what is the basis for Mr. Lu's statement that it is the origin of "drama lists"? I have said in the previous article that "order of music" is the order of playing glory. Mr. Lu probably said this based on this point. "Old Events in Wulin" does not specify the usage of "order of music." However, judging from the styles seen in the old events today, it is different from today's "drama lists."

Xuan Nan Ling Meng Lu:

"At that time, the drama lists of each garden were printed on yellow paper about two inches long and one inch high. Before this list was sent, the best dramas selected from the day's drama list in the garden were presented to the officials on red list sheets, and each official passed them around for viewing. Those who wished to watch them first were rewarded with ten or twenty coins after reading."

Meng Hua Suo Bu:

"Three-inch red note narrow drama list. According to today's drama garden, there is no drama list. The actors or write on a piece of paper and put it in their sleeves for acquaintances to consult. Only the hall party still uses red paper drama list."

Chapter 5 of "Appreciating Flowers and Identifying Treasures": "...Seeing the follower of Pin Cai walk to Pin Cai's side and say: Mr. Ye sent the drama list. Zi Yu came over and looked at it with Pin Cai. Seeing the first few dramas were Sweeping Flowers, Three Drunkennesses, Discussing Swords, and Visiting Teachers..."

The records about drama lists are scattered in various notes and novels, and there should be more than this. However, records with the same meaning as the "drama list" mentioned by Mr. Lu are not common.

"Curtain list" plays a role in civilization dramas similar to the string used to string money in ancient times. The main programs of a play are written on the list, and the actors follow this list. When the last program listed on the list is finished, the play is considered finished. This was a product of a transitional era in the early Chinese drama movement when there were no scripts. In terms of its nature, form, and purpose, it has nothing to do with "Arranging the Order of Music." (To be continued)

### Strange Theories

— Ti Zhai

Throughout history, there have been two schools of thought. One is dedicated to factual evidence, not allowing for even half a false statement. The other leans towards speculation, freely ranging from near to far, from A to B. The former belongs to induction, while the latter might be勉强be considered deduction. There have always been many absurd stories in ancient times, such as "The Tale of King Mu," "Classic of Mountains and Seas," "Li Sao," and "Heavenly Questions." Their meaning leans towards speculation or imagination, with both truth and falsehood. Sima Qian had a relatively scientific mind and felt that before the Yellow Emperor, without evidence, there was no belief. He resolutely cut out several legendary eras. One cannot say that his vision was not far-sighted. However, the Grand Historian wasn't as rigid as Western scientists, opening both big and small doors for both big and small cats. Therefore, his writing is still full of novelistic and legendary depictions, so as not to bore us, thus becoming an eternal masterpiece.

People in the Qing Dynasty were threatened by literary inquisitions and other things, so they had to delve into old papers, and they absolutely did not dare to express different opinions. Evidential historical research became very popular. Even so, they did not dare to go beyond the circle of their predecessors to be suspicious, so they were slaves to the ancients. It was not until the Changzhou School used Gongyang philosophy as a theory that it brought out Kang Youwei's skeptical school, laying the foundation for modern new historiography. The articles of the seven or eight large volumes of "Debates on Ancient History" are actually all from the same school.

Skepticism is indeed good, because of it there is investigation and verification. The interpretation and application of oracle bones and bronze inscriptions have completely changed the appearance of ancient history. In addition, the import of new social sciences has allowed people three thousand years later to have a further understanding of three thousand years ago. Although elders like Zhang Taiyan and Lü Chengzhi did not believe in these things, it was ultimately ineffective.

However, there are also problems, which are the creation of various baseless strange theories, arbitrarily speaking, regardless of facts, and without looking for evidence, "only wanting to hear strange things." I think this is also not good. Slowly, it may completely plunge evidential historical research into the quagmire of fantasy, which will get further and further away from the pursuit of truth in scholarship.

For example, someone regards Mo Di as an Indian, completely developing it from the character "Mo." I feel that it is too involved in imagination and has long been criticized. Unexpectedly, recently reading the "New China Magazine," there is another claim that An Lushan is a transliteration of Alexander. The reason is nothing more than that the English spelling of An's name starts with A, as does Alexander, and Alexander the Great's military power once reached Asia, and Lushan was a foreign barbarian, etc. Such verification, how can it not be ridiculous? And a serious academic publication randomly publishes such things that are not established, which is also a bit of a disadvantage.

Checking the household registration book of the tenth year of the Tianbao era discovered in Dunhuang, there are many foreign surnames, and many belong to the Western Regions or Persia. Names that are similar in sound to An Lushan include "Alehushan" and "Gayingshan." Therefore, the Japanese historian Kuwabara Jitsuzo suspected that the An family was Persian, but still did not dare to conclude that it was Alexander, because the sound of "Alehushan" is ultimately different from the arrangement of Alexander. The author of the previous article did not even see this point, and has such a rash arrogance, which is probably similar to saying that Mo Di was a red-headed Ah San, which is really not worth learning from. I feel that the spirit of the Chinese people has always been to seek truth from facts, but in recent times, it has turned the other way. Everything does not start from a little bit, but focuses on startling the world and establishing differences in order to attract attention. This trend is very worrying! Maybe this is the "Shanghai style"?

### Feelings on a Rainy Day

— Ze Shi

I can't recall which book it was, but a certain foreigner said something along the lines of: "The most useful things in the world are not necessarily the most valuable, and the most valuable things are not necessarily the most useful. For example, diamonds and water. The former has little practical use, yet its price is surprisingly high. The latter is indispensable to humans, second only to air, yet it is extremely cheap." This statement is very true. It's not just diamonds and water, but also the difference between people. There are plenty of people in the world who are utterly useless, yet they wear silk and satin, eat delicacies from land and sea, and are driven around in imported cars, damaging the roads and even killing pigs and dogs that are more useful than them. Conversely, those who toil their entire lives, shedding blood and sweat for the benefit of the people, end up poorly clothed and underfed.

Getting back to the point, although water is not as valuable as diamonds by a factor of billions, to the poor commoners who don't even know what diamonds are, in cities like Shanghai that have waterworks, water is almost a luxury. The flush toilet in my house has been broken for a long time, and the cost of repairing it is very high, so we haven't been able to flush it. The family has to carry water to flush it, but my mother strictly forbids wasting clean water, only allowing us to use the leftover dirty water after washing our faces, clothes, rice, and vegetables. Sometimes, I or the children forget her instructions and turn on the tap in preparation, and as soon as she sees it, she will exclaim sternly, "Amitabha! The water bill was so high last month, and you still don't know how to save a little!" Not only that, but our water tap is a bit loose, and we have to tighten it forcefully when turning it off to prevent it from dripping. This worries her immensely, even more than my concern for national affairs. Every night before going to bed, she makes sure to tighten it forcefully, and sometimes she suddenly gets up in the middle of the night, asking what's wrong. She says she heard the sound of the tap dripping, but there's really no such thing. It can be seen that water is of no small value to my mother, and if this continues, I'm truly worried that her nerves will give way.

Is this just a matter for my family? If so, that would be fine. But in fact, there are probably countless families on the Shanghai Bund who are concerned about the cost of tap water. Therefore, I often wonder. Water is a gift from heaven, something indispensable to human life. Heaven bestows it upon people, so why do we have to pay money to get it? For technique, for convenience, I support tap water. If water is to come by itself, factories must be built, machines purchased, and water pipes installed, etc. This is what is called cost and investment, of course, charging fees is necessary to maintain the business and make a profit. But water itself ultimately comes from the sky, requiring no manual labor. Compared to roads, it doesn't require opening and construction, nor does it need to be paved with asphalt or wood blocks, of course, saving much money and effort. The need for water is millions of times more important than the need to walk on asphalt roads, so why do city governments around the world know to allocate funds for building and repairing roads, and do not set a price, charging people a few dollars and cents for walking a mile, but are unwilling to establish waterworks, making people pay for water, and pay a considerable amount?

Therefore, I often lament that the so-called civilization and progress of the world, and the efforts of governments to seek happiness for the people, are all empty words, not worth mentioning. Whether the world is truly civilized or not, and whether governments are truly seeking welfare for the people, I want to determine by whether humans have to pay for drinking water that falls from the sky. In Victor Hugo's novel "Les Misérables," there is a line that says: "God gives light to men, and the law sells it for money." In France at that time, there was a limit to how many windows a family could have, and a fee had to be paid for exceeding the limit. Now, 85 years have passed since the publication of "Les Misérables," but governments around the world still allow giant merchants and wealthy businessmen to sell water bestowed upon humans by heaven for profit. It can be seen that the world is still...

Today, heavy rain is falling, and I am awake late at night, listening to the sound of rain outside the window, imagining the streets filled with water channels and the Huangpu River rising several inches. Then, I think of my mother, who might be worried about the tap water bill even in her sleep, waking up and checking if the tap is tightly closed, regardless of the risk of catching a cold. I deeply feel that the absurdity and contradictions of the world are truly unbelievable.

### Humor

— Wang Baili

In the History of the Song Dynasty, Mi Yuanzhang was the prefect of Wuwei Army. There was a huge rock in the state, with a strange and ugly shape. Yuanzhang saw it and was overjoyed, saying, "This is enough to receive my worship." He put on his official attire and bowed to it, calling it "elder brother." Such was his humor. Recently, I saw in "Miscellaneous Notes from the Willow South Studio" that "Wu Li, whose courtesy name was Yushan, was from Changshu. He lived in a place called Inkwell, so he called himself the Daoist of Inkwell. He was skilled in poetry and painting, and also proficient in calligraphy, capturing the style of Su Shi. He once traveled to Wuxing and visited its prefect. He was not immediately received upon entering, so he strolled to a monk's abode and saw Su Shi's authentic work, 'Ode to the Drunken Old Man.' He was so delighted that he rented the place and set up his mat there, unrolling the scroll and copying it for three or four days without fatigue. The prefect sent people to search everywhere for the Daoist of Inkwell, but there was no one. The innkeepers also did not know where he had gone. After finishing the copying, he was happily satisfied and left without seeing the prefect. Such was his noble demeanor." This is similar to Cai Shangshu entering the Hongdu Temple stele and not returning for ten days, sharing the same kind of humor, so I have recorded them together.

### On Human Nature and Worldly Wisdom

— Jingwen

As long as someone is human, they have their own experiences of social life. Once these life experiences are formalized, they become what is known as human nature and worldly wisdom. Therefore, as long as someone is human, they more or less understand some human nature and worldly wisdom.

Life experiences are valuable life lessons, and human nature and worldly wisdom are the accumulation of these lessons, so naturally they are worthy of cherishing. However, anything that comes from progress will turn into a stumbling block when it can no longer be used for further progress. Human nature and worldly wisdom are like that.

Everyone recognizes that the current social atmosphere is too bad. Corruption, speculation, fraud, and other similar things that show the decline of social morality fill the pages of newspapers almost every day. Laws cannot prevent problems before they happen, and punishments can only serve as a warning after the fact. I remember that not long before the victory, a newspaper published an article titled "Don't Let People's Hearts Open the Floodgates." At that time, it had already sensed that such a serious social problem might come. And now, it is not just opening the floodgates, but more like the dike has burst.

The individual reasons for the problem are naturally extremely complex. For example, from the perspective of corruption, many people believe that it is caused by the fact that the salaries of civil servants are not enough to support their integrity. This is indeed true. But there is an even more important reason, and that is the psychology created by being full of worldly wisdom. Many people think that in this era, it is foolish not to make "extra money" when doing things. If you don't make it, someone else will. Since the situation is like this, why should I be the only fool?

When friends meet, and they talk about each other's life situation, they always have to ask whether you have any other "income" besides your regular income. The person being asked may not necessarily give a positive answer, but they understand each other with a smile. The more ways you have to make money, the less others will look down on you, and they will secretly admire your "ability." Seeing someone wearing a brand new suit and shiny leather shoes recently, even though they know that the person's normal income cannot be like this, they will always compliment, "Brother, you really have a way." Moreover, nine out of ten of these compliments are not hypocritical politeness, but genuine admiration from the bottom of their hearts. The person being complimented is also complacent, thinking it is natural. This is because they all understand this set of human nature and worldly wisdom.

Many things that are originally sinful will be regarded as normal by everyone as long as they are explained through human nature and worldly wisdom. For example, "skimming" is originally an improper behavior, but now it has long been considered a natural atmosphere by everyone. Not skimming has become abnormal! The nanny skimming when buying groceries, the housewife thinks it is natural, even if there is a "honest" nanny, in the eyes of the owner, she is still inevitably in the category of skimming. Because the owner has this kind of psychology, what does the nanny rely on if she doesn't rely on extra money?

Going a step further, what is the psychological motivation for bribery and corruption? There is such a kind of psychological understanding between the briber and the bribee. The psychology of the briber is: "He is the person who is doing this kind of job. If I don't drop a few small coppers on him, I will be troubled by him. Forget it, these few dollars can't be saved anyway." And the psychology of the bribee is: "What am I doing? If I don't take his money, someone else will take it. Since he is sensible, I am also happy to. Besides, the emperor does not send hungry soldiers, how can I live on this little dead salary? Convenience for others, convenience for myself. So-and-so is doing this, why should I be insensible!"

"Sensible" is a key to being deeply versed in human nature and worldly wisdom. The so-called knowing the tricks of the trade will not suffer losses. Otherwise, you will inevitably be scolded as a "fool."

What a terrible human nature and worldly wisdom! But it is precisely the general atmosphere of today's urban society, and the general psychology of society. If you don't understand these things, you are bound to be a failure in this society.

I am not a moralist, but I am afraid that our nation that understands human nature and worldly wisdom will fall into an unrecoverable abyss because of this—experience is what we need, but what we need more today is new life, new blood. Those who are referred to as fools and idiots, you are blessed, Amen!

### Born on the Fifth Day of the Fifth Month

— Gan Jing

The brief biography of Wang Zhen'e in the History of the Southern Dynasties says: "Zhen'e was the grandson of Wang Meng, and was born on the fifth day of the fifth month. Meng thought it strange and said: 'In the past, Mengchang Jun was born on an unlucky day but became the prime minister of Qi. Will this child also prosper my family?' So he named him Zhen'e," etc. It can be seen that being born on the fifth day of the fifth month was tabooed by the customs of the time. However, in addition to Mengchang Jun and Wang Zhen'e, according to the Miscellaneous Records of Leng Lu, there were also Hu Guang (Hu Guang of the Han Dynasty, not Hu Guang of the Song Dynasty), Zhang Fei, Wang Feng, Emperor Gao Wei of Northern Qi, Wang Chuo of Nanyang in Northern Qi, Cui Xinming, Emperor Huizong of Song, Weng Yinglong, Ji Guo, Empress Yide of Liao, Zhao Yuanhao, etc., whose experiences were all different. What is strange is that Tian Texiu was born on the fifth day of the fifth month, and his nickname was Wu'er (Fifth Child). The name of the village he lived in was "Half Ten," and he was the fifth child in his family. At the age of twenty-five, he ranked fifth in the four imperial examinations in the village and prefecture. He died on the fifteenth day of the eighth month at the age of fifty-five (see History of Jin).

### Carefree Flowers

— Chen Shenyan

Chapter 4: Two Hearts in Harmony

Zhu Zhai repeatedly said thank you, took it, and suddenly felt a burst of fragrance hit his nose. He folded it carefully, put it in his pocket, and helped Qi Wan walk down the Pinghe. The two of them stepped out of the garden in the moonlight. Zhu Zhai wanted to hire a car, but Qi Wan said, "No need, the moonlight is very good today, and there's no one at night, let's just take a walk." She then reached out and put her arm on Zhu Zhai's arm. The two of them walked slowly, fortunately not encountering any acquaintances along the way. Qi Wan kept asking Zhu Zhai about her parents' temperaments, living situation, how many years he had been working at the bank, and what good friends he had outside. As they talked, they unknowingly walked out of Xuanwumen and reached Xiaochang Hutong, not far from Qi Wan's home. Suddenly, a black car drove into the alley. Qi Wan was quick-witted and quickly pulled Zhu Zhai to the side of the road to let the car pass. Qi Wan then shook Zhu Zhai's hand and said, "I'm almost home, you don't need to see me off, see you tomorrow." After saying that, she hurriedly walked forward. Zhu Zhai was talking intimately with Qi Wan all the way, and was in the midst of enthusiastic agitation, when Qi Wan suddenly stopped him like this. He stood there stunned. Watching Qi Wan busy walking forward, he felt lost! He stood foolishly under the locust tree by the side of the road, seeing that the black car had stopped in front of Qi Wan's two green doors. The red light behind the car flashed, reversing the car for more than ten steps, turning the car body, turning the front of the car, and the two car lights in front shone out with a light of several feet, shining right under the old locust tree. Zhu Zhai was shaken back to his senses by the light in front of him, feeling that standing here was too meaningless. He sighed slightly, and walked slowly with lazy steps and lowered his head, feeling only annoyed and touched. When he reached the entrance of the alley, he was about to hire a car when the horn suddenly sounded, and the black car swept past him, only a few inches away. Zhu Zhai was almost hit by the car, and was startled, quickly dodging. In this glance, he suddenly saw Qi Wan and a man in the car, and his nerves trembled again! Under this shock, hate and jealousy suddenly arose in his heart. He thought that Qi Wan was an innocent girl, how could she be close to these people! Her family education is very strict, why did her family let her do it! Immediately, jealousy turned into doubt, wanting to find out and resolve this question. Thinking this way, he immediately changed his mind, not wanting to go back. He thought to himself that the little Wang Ma in her house seemed to be very talkative. Asking her might reveal the truth, so he re-entered the alley and went to Qi Wan's door. He squatted down, grabbed some loose soil on the ground, and brushed it on his sleeves and trouser legs, then pressed the doorbell several times in a row. Little Wang Ma opened half a door and looked out, saw that it was Zhu Zhai, and quickly smiled, "Mr. Xu is here, the boss is not at home." Zhu Zhai pretended to be very embarrassed and said, "I'm really unlucky! I was hit by a car and almost died!" When Little Wang Ma heard this, she immediately opened both doors. The electric light inside the door shone on Zhu Qi's body. Sure enough, he was covered in dust, as if he had fallen on the street and just crawled up. She asked in surprise, "Hit by a car, are you injured? Please come in quickly." As she spoke, she made way, standing beside the door, letting Zhu Zhai walk in with a limp. (End of this chapter).

### Contributor's Remarks

— Luota

"Life is like a mayfly" is an overstatement; "articles are like mayflies" is an undeniable fact. Mayflies live for a day, and articles in newspapers last from the time they come out of the rolling machine to the time they are used to wrap fried dough sticks, a total of only five or six hours. Morning newspapers don't know about branches, and evening newspapers don't last until morning. How much "spiritual" expenditure is there in a day and night! One night, passing by the Baxianqiao vegetable market, I saw truckloads of bloody cattle and sheep transported from the slaughterhouse, and I couldn't help but feel the same pity for my own and others' hard work.

If selling smiles is the most despicable profession, then selling articles must be the most foolish profession. An intellectual has exhausted all kinds of ways to make money before resorting to this last resort. Take pulling rickshaws, for example. Passengers still negotiate the price before daring to get on. What about you? You let people give you whatever they want after you arrive at your destination. Last year, I wrote an article for a newspaper, and the first half of the month, 3,000 words earned 30,000 yuan. The second half of the month, 6,000 words, I thought I could get 60,000 yuan this time, but the newspaper lost money, and I only received 15,000 yuan. I remember that in elementary school math class, I never understood what was called "inverse proportion." One day, the teacher asked me a question: If one person can finish a job in two days, how about two people? I replied, "Four days," and the whole class laughed. Now I have finally "experienced" it once. I am prepared. This may be even more ridiculous, but I have to swallow my tears.

### Duck

— Xu Tonghua

Today, the author returned from the office, and the sky was already dusk. Wang Ma moved a bowl of well-cooked duck and placed it squarely in the center of the table. According to my wife, winter is the season for tonic nourishment, which made me think of an old story about ducks.

That year, in late autumn, my wife came out of her hometown, S city, bringing a fat duck, saying that it was specially given to me by one of her fellow villagers. This duck had been raised for five or six years. According to popular explanations, its nourishing properties were particularly high. Therefore, my wife happily brought it out, preparing to let me finish the whole duck in two days when the weather turned cool. My wife insisted on not letting anyone else share a taste, otherwise, the nourishing properties would be diminished. There was some superstitious element involved.

In the following days, the weather remained hot. The duck was raised in the courtyard in front of the house. I had gone downstairs to see it a few times. In my memory, it was a pitiful little animal. Flapping its wings, walking wobbly, bulging its round eyes, not saying whether it was a sad or happy expression. However, it may have suffered from the so-called "acclimatization" problem, and its body became increasingly thin.

After that, one day, it was slightly chilly. My wife, seeing that the duck's weight had decreased, felt that she could no longer wait. That night, when I came home, the table was, as mentioned in the first paragraph of this article, also filled with a bowl of duck soup, but this time, it was cooked more elaborately with fennel and other seasonings.

When I was eating the duck, my wife smiled and said to me that something very unexpected happened today. I asked her what it was. She said she would tell me after I finished eating. So, I finished this large bowl of duck. There were still two large bowls in the pot, ready to be eaten by me in two installments tomorrow.

After dinner, my wife told me what happened.

At that time, I did not yet employ Wang Ma in my house. The former maid did not know how to kill ducks. My wife specially invited a clerk from the rice store next door and asked him if he knew how to kill ducks. He said, "Yes, yes." He picked up the duck and went out, gave it a blow to the head with a knife, threw it on the ground, and left on his own accord.

The maid placed the killed duck in an open bucket and poured hot water into it. Who knew that its throat had not been severed. When the hot water rushed in, it came back to life, tilted its head, and ran out of the back door, straight into the rice store next door.

The rice store clerk stared at it blankly, as if the duck was "demanding its life" from him. He repeatedly said, "I didn't eat it, it has nothing to do with me." In an instant, the duck dove into the pit in the rice store, and it was difficult to catch it again.

At this moment, the maid placed the duck alive in the bucket and scalded it to death with hot water. When plucking the duck feathers, there were many fine feathers, and it took her almost an hour to pluck them all. My wife was afraid that I would lose my appetite after hearing this, so she waited until I had finished a large bowl before telling me.

The next day, I went to the residence of a senior elder in my wife's family on Tongfu Road for some business. Before leaving, my wife repeatedly urged me to come back and finish the leftover duck soup. That day, it happened that the host was hosting a banquet, and I had not visited for a long time, so they insisted on keeping me for dinner. I still remember very clearly that there was a Mr. C at the table, the former general manager of a certain bank and the current broker of the Securities Exchange, as well as a Mr. K, an industrialist from the inland.

At first, I made up my mind to taste each dish slightly and then stop, so that I could wait to go home and eat the duck. However, the host was so diligent that whenever he saw me stopping after a shallow taste, he would pile the dishes into my small plate. The dishes that day were not only well-cooked, but also very sumptuous. My defense line finally completely collapsed. After drinking five or six cups of wine and eating two bowls of rice lightly, when I stood up, I suddenly felt an excessive sense of being drunk and full. When I went back that day, it was already nine o'clock. My wife was guarding the bowl of duck, waiting for me. With some apology, I refused her kindness, as there was really no room for more. I had to eat it the next day.

However, the next day, the weather suddenly turned hot. By noon, the duck had already gone bad. A pungent, spoiled sour smell filled the air, so it had to be poured into the trash can outside the door.

I watched my wife come in with the empty bowl, and I suddenly felt a different kind of feeling: this duck had been painstakingly raised for five or six years, brought to Shanghai from afar, and it took so much effort to kill it. How much my wife hoped that I could finish it all by myself, but in the end, the leftovers were still poured away! A sense of melancholy swept through my heart. These two days, I have been reading Hemingway's collection of novels for the second time, and the words are filled with a faint sadness. I thought of the old story, as if I had become a character in this foreign novelist's pen.
