Zhangjiakou Conference on Stabilizing Suiyuan and Chahar Opens
It Is Reported That Chairman Fu Zuoyi Delivered a Speech Emphasizing National Defense in the North; More Than Sixty Proposals Discussed; Closed on the Same Day
[Central News Agency, Zhangjiakou, 18th] Chairman Fu Zuoyi stated in his speech at the work review conference for the stabilization area that Rehe, Chahar, and Suiyuan are as important to the northern defense line as the Northeast and Northwest. The northern defense line is truly the key to the safety of all of North China. Historically, any strong and prosperous dynasty owed its success to the stability of the northern defense line and invested the greatest talent and money in it. Today, we must not disregard it. As for the Inner Mongolia problem, those who do not understand the truth believe it is complex, but in reality, it is quite simple. I dare to say responsibly that the Inner Mongolian compatriots absolutely support the central government and absolutely oppose division. The people of Chahar and Suiyuan are indeed very poor, but the crux of the problem is not just poverty; it is like holding a golden bowl and begging for food. Chahar and Suiyuan are rich in resources, and if they can be developed, all problems can be easily solved. The conference opened at 8:00 AM on the 17th. Reports on various tasks were heard, and more than sixty proposals related to politics, finance, and economy were discussed in the afternoon. The conference closed at around 6:00 PM.

They plan to stay in Beiping for a few days to compile their report before returning to Nanjing, without going to Taiyuan. According to Qiu, Chahar and Suiyuan provinces are largely implementing the policies of relief, cooperation, agriculture, and land set by the Suiyuan Political Affairs Committee. Small loans have been widely distributed, greatly increasing social vitality, but spring plowing is still a problem due to the lack of livestock and manpower. Qiu also said that Chahar and Suiyuan provinces are in good order, with cooperation between the party, government, and military. Public officials are hardworking, and politics are clean. He concluded by saying that Chahar and Suiyuan are located on the front lines of national defense, and their land is rich in coal and iron. The people are particularly hardworking, and if cooperative farms can be effectively developed, adult education can be organized, and telecommunications and transportation can be strengthened, the future is limitless.

The central government has adopted a lenient policy to comfort them." Their meeting lasted one hour. Bai then toured the city and visited the museum, where he studied the deeds of national heroes Zheng Chenggong, Tang Jing, Liu Yongfu, and Qiu Fengjia for a long time. At 11:00 AM, he went to the military headquarters and convened a meeting of army, navy, and air force officers stationed in Taiwan for instructions. Bai said, "Soldiers and officers who have performed meritorious service in this unfortunate incident will be rewarded, and people in society who understand righteousness and understand the big picture will also be commended. As for the compatriots who were injured, killed, or suffered damage, they will be given condolences and compensation accordingly." Bai continued, "The mission of the army, navy, and air force units stationed in Taiwan is to consolidate national defense. Taiwan is an important stronghold for our country's coastal defense, and its position is extremely important. I hope that the army, navy, and air force personnel will work together to consolidate Taiwan."

Bai said in his speech that the Taiwan incident was incited by a small number of Communist elements and a small number of vagrants in Taiwan and that it has now largely stabilized. Some young people are still hiding in the mountains, and it is hoped that they will return soon and live in peace. The government has decided not to pursue them. Lin Xiantang then gave a speech saying that the unfortunate incident was caused by the past assimilation policy of the Japanese, which caused a small number of Taiwanese compatriots to develop a narrow island mentality, resulting in today's rash behavior. For these young people, their mistaken mentality should be corrected through education in the future. Chen Yi said in his speech that the childish actions of a small number of young people in Taiwan were due to the Japanese education's fear of losing and disdain for China, which became the source of the rash actions of a small number of Taiwanese compatriots today. I have adopted a lenient attitude in the past three broadcasts and have advised public officials from other provinces not to take retaliatory actions. I would like to reiterate my guarantee and take this opportunity to express my gratitude to the kind Taiwanese compatriots who rescued people from other provinces during this incident.

Hong Kong's Industry and Commerce Is Stagnant
Purchasing Power Declines, The Market Will Generally Decline, Goods Are Oversupplied, The Black Market Disappears Invisibly
[Reuters, Hong Kong, 17th] Hong Kong is now experiencing a decline in purchasing power. Responsible observers predict that if China's economic problems are not resolved, the market will inevitably decline generally by this summer. After the fear of devaluation of the Hong Kong dollar disappeared, the phenomenon of local goods has become a thing of the past. In general, people are unwilling to pay high prices for anything other than necessities. This is because consumption has reached saturation, but goods are still pouring in. After the Chinese government promulgated measures to restrict imports, Shanghai merchants' orders were unable to be imported, so they had to shift their targets and dump their goods in Hong Kong. At present, the black market in Hong Kong has invisibly disappeared due to oversupply and strict crackdowns by the authorities. Those who ordered goods from abroad six months ago lost a lot of money after the goods arrived. The market price of luxury goods is lower than the limited price. Now, a large number of goods arrive every other day. Merchants have no other way out but to cut prices and sell them locally. However, major grains are still rationed. At the same time, due to the increase in population, rents continue to rise. There are homeless people everywhere, and the number of unemployed people is also increasing day by day. The cost of living is about five to six times higher than before the war. Due to the difficulty in selling goods, the money supply is very tight and interest rates are high. The local industry cannot compete with foreign goods due to the high wages of skilled workers. For example, the selling price of foreign-made suits is cheaper than the local labor cost. This economic stagnation is definitely not something that the Hong Kong government can handle alone. Hong Kong's economy is closely linked to mainland China. Every economic or monetary fluctuation in China is not enough to shake Hong Kong's economy. Therefore, it is difficult to expect the situation in Hong Kong to improve until the situation in China returns to normal.

[Our Newspaper] Director Gu of the Municipal Education Bureau held a tea party in the bureau's auditorium at 3:00 PM yesterday to welcome the newly elected district heads of the city and to discuss the promotion of the "Building Schools to Celebrate Longevity" campaign stipulated by the Ministry of Education. Xiang Chang-quan, Secretary-General of the Municipal Council, Li Hsueh-hsun, Section Chief of the Civil Affairs Department, and more than 50 district and deputy district heads from Huangpu, Lao Zha, and 30 other districts attended. Deputy Director Li, Division Chief Zhu, Section Chief Lu, and Section Chief Sun of the Education Bureau were invited to accompany them. Director Gu delivered a speech first, welcoming the new district heads to their posts and expressing his hope that they would work together to promote national education, which is the foundation of national construction. The percentage of school-age children enrolled in school in the city has reached an average of 80%, but some districts have only reached 40%, and there are more than 10 districts with less than 70%. Therefore, joint efforts are needed in the future to gradually reduce the number of out-of-school children. It is planned to add 500 classes to national schools this semester and 1,000 classes next semester. The recurrent expenses will be borne by the government, but it is hoped that the local authorities will be jointly responsible for the construction of school buildings and the provision of equipment. The "Building Schools to Celebrate Longevity" campaign can compensate for this shortcoming. The director also reported that the principles for raising funds for public welfare undertakings such as education in various districts have been approved by the municipal government. The Ministry of Education has also issued eight points for attention in guiding the "Building Schools to Celebrate Longevity" campaign, and each district can handle it in accordance with the regulations of the Ministry of Education. Secretary-General Xiang then reported on the progress of the "Building Schools to Celebrate Longevity" campaign in the city, explaining that the donation brochures have been printed by the Municipal Council and can be collected and used by each district when needed. Section Chief Li of the Civil Affairs Department hoped that the first thing that the new district heads would do after taking office is to handle the educational undertakings that are most beneficial to the people, concentrate their efforts, and resolve various difficulties such as school building construction fees to complete this meaningful work. From now on, the cultural divisions of each district must earnestly take responsibility to assist in the promotion of national education. Division Chief Zhu of the Education Bureau reported on the principles for increasing the number of national schools this semester, paying attention to the balanced development of each district. Districts in the city such as Putuo and Lao Zha do not have a municipal school, and it is hoped that municipal schools in districts such as Huangpu, Xincheng, and Lujia will also be established as soon as possible. It is also hoped that the old municipal schools with bases in districts such as Hunan will be restored as soon as possible. Section Chief Sun of the Social Education Division reported on the practical difficulties in promoting popular education, hoping that the new district heads can assist in resolving them. During the meeting, the Education Bureau distributed guidance books such as the promotion of national education and reference materials for school construction, totaling eight types, and specific methods for promoting literacy education. Director Gu reported on them one by one as a reference for implementation in each district and invited the district heads to express their opinions. District Head Zhong of Gaoqiao District asked whether the district office could report any areas in which the district's schools need to be improved to the Education Bureau for adoption and implementation. Director Gu expressed his acceptance. District Head Wang of Zhabei District suggested that in order to promote the "Building Schools to Celebrate Longevity" campaign, it seems necessary to establish organizations for promoting school construction and celebrating longevity in each district in order to promote this work so that it can achieve satisfactory results. After exchanging opinions, it was decided that the Civil Affairs Department would formulate methods for donation receipts and notify each district to collect them from the Municipal Council.

Basketball Sideline Notes
The final good show of the basketball league Group A, Enkas first flourished and then declined, losing to the ever-victorious army Shantei team.
At the opening, Enkas frequently used mid-range shots, as if aided by God, nine out of ten shots hit, this opening show of force, had an impact on the Shantei team's combat psychology.
The most abnormal state was Chen Qingjiang, who did not score in the first half. Ge Peng Qigu Fu used his height to subdue He Lide's elasticity, but He was still the best performer for the Shantei team last night.
In the first half, Enkas threw in ten balls, and the Shantei team only put in five balls, the advantages and disadvantages of the situation can be seen. Enkas had many tall people, and the strength and speed were equal to the Shantei team, and the shooting was smooth, so they took all the advantages.
In the second half, at 24 to 16, Ji Nankang was sent off, and Lin Weicong entered as a substitute with illness. The Shantei team changed to offensive tactics and once made the score close and behind at 25 to 22, 31 to 24. At this time, the actions of both sides were rough, and the excitement was completely lost. The Shantei team only relied on He Lide to grab the ball under the basket to support the balance. Xiao Lin and V. Cairo Suki had a misunderstanding and were both judged to leave the court. Lin Zhiren entered as a substitute, Ma Zai. Qingjiang threw in the ball, and unexpectedly forced a tie, Qingjiang fined in, the Shantei team reversed and exceeded one point at 32 to 31.
At this time, there were still four minutes left, the situation was chaotic, and there were often three or five people piled up into one country. Enkas repeatedly fouled, Qingjiang made two free throws, and Zhiren made two throws, all of which hit, the Shantei team reversed the defeat in the last four minutes.
The victory of the Shantei team was mostly due to luck. When both sides were caught in a melee, Shantei Qingjiang had been injured and could not run. Fortunately, he relied on his calm mind and Lin Zhiren took the opportunity to score two goals. The last goal was a long shot, which was somewhat lucky. (Changnian)
The Stalemate in the Zhengda University Student Movement
The student movement at "Zhengda" has been going on for three weeks since the students took a collective leave of absence on February 20. Although Principal Xiao's head injury has healed, the Student School Protection Association still insists that they will not resume classes until the goal of Principal's Xiao's resignation is achieved. Cheng Chi-pao, a specialist from the Ministry of Education, came to Nanchang to mediate. The day before yesterday, he held the first hearing to listen to the opinions and reports of teachers, staff and students regarding the student movement. He put forward the instruction to restore order as soon as possible. The students' response was "no resumption of classes until the goal is achieved," so the Zhengda student movement is now at a standstill.
At the meeting with teachers and staff of Zhengda, Cheng conveyed Minister Zhu's three opinions on the student movement. He believed that Zhengda was congenitally deficient and acquired imbalances, and urgently needed to be replenished, and must not be subjected to cold strikes. The students' demands for "professors, books, instruments, factories, and farms" are all legitimate, and the government should do its best to find solutions. Cheng also emphasized that spiritual construction is more important than material construction. He advocated that universities should be like ancient academies, establishing an ethos that influences society and the country. The establishment of Zhengda has special significance, and in addition to knowledge transmission, attention should be paid to the cultivation of personality. Professors should pay attention to this to compensate for the deficiencies of the current guidance system.
Chairman Chiang expressed particular concern about the Zhengda student movement. When Cheng came to Jiangxi from Beijing, he was instructed to "hope that Zhengda will quickly restore order and does not want it to get out of hand. If it really gets out of hand, he will never be tolerant." Cheng believes that in mediating this student movement, he should not pay too much attention to small things to avoid generating more complexities. Regarding the point of punishing the murderer for Principal Xiao's injury by students, he said: "At that time, it was late at night and the order was chaotic. It was inappropriate for the students to injure the principal with stones, which was an overstepping behavior. However, it is difficult to find the real murderer to punish now. At the same time, we cannot just identify the students who are participating in the school protection movement or the department representatives as the murderers who attacked the principal." He also stated that the school's order is stable, not because of procrastination, and the reasons for the student movement and how to avoid the same incidents in the future must be investigated and resolved.
Regarding the issue of Principal Xiao's resignation, Dean of Academic Affairs Luo Rongzi said: "It is unprecedented in national and world universities for a president of a national university to be injured by students, and it is also a major stain on Chinese university education. If it is not dealt with seriously, no one will dare to take up the post of president of Zhengda in the future, and no one will dare to take up the post of professor of Zhengda."
Regarding the student movement, a professor in the Department of Politics said: "It is a pity that the professors blame the students for taking a collective leave of absence and wasting their time. The School Affairs Committee issued a notice on the 22nd of last month to persuade the students to resume classes, but it was ineffective. Therefore, the resumption of classes in the future depends not on the professors but on the students. It is not permissible to injure the principal by students, and they should be punished." Professor Hu Guangting said: "Five professors informally convened representatives from each department to painstakingly persuade the students to resume classes, and the school also issued a notice, but there was no reply." Hu believes that suspending classes in this state for three weeks is different from taking a vacation. Professors feel as depressed as the students. The only hope is to maintain the school and make it thrive and have a bright future.
Liu Xiang, Director of the Department of Chemistry, was newly hired by Principal Xiao. He encountered this unfortunate incident only four days after arriving at the school. He said: "Zhengda has a shallow history, a poor research environment, and I am still new to Principal Xiao, but I heard that Zhengda has a strong research atmosphere and a good school spirit, so I accepted the job." His opinion on the student movement: "(1) Some of the students' demands are reasonable, and the professors also sympathize. (2) The students' methods are not correct. If they hope to achieve their goals by means of 'making trouble' and 'taking a collective leave of absence,' the professors will not come, and they will get less and less. He gave an example: Principal Xiao hired four professors in Shanghai at the same time. Two of them originally wanted to come to Jiangxi, but when they heard that there was a student movement, they decided not to come. (3) The Ministry of Education subsidizes schools based on the history of the school and the school's performance. Zhengda is congenitally deficient and acquired imbalances. If there is a small disturbance every three days and a large disturbance every five days, the school will be more and more unbalanced, and the more disturbances there are, the less opportunities there are to obtain subsidies. (4) Even if the principal is dissatisfied with the students, he cannot be beaten to the point of breaking his head and demand that the Ministry of Education replace him."
The representatives of the Student School Protection Association quoted Cheng Chi-pao's lecture: "Zhengda is congenitally deficient and acquired imbalances" infants, they likened Principal Xiao to a milkmaid without milk. How can a mother without milk be entrusted with the important task of nurturing an infant? They also compared Cheng to an experienced doctor who can see the truth and use scientific methods to replace the infant with a milkmaid with milk.
The 1414 young students of Zhengda took leave and suspended classes for the sake of "protecting the school," although it is for the future of Zhengda, but the real loss is still on the students. Therefore, Cheng Chi-pao's first prescription for the Zhengda student movement is to restore order. As of recently, this Cheng "doctor" is making a final effort on the "restoration of order" before performing surgery—executing the Ministry of Education's order to dissolve the student association.

Articles on the National Games are often published in newspapers, and the general opinions are the same, advocating that the National Games be held this year to select outstanding athletes to represent the country in the World Games next year. More importantly, it is to express the profound significance of national unity, peace and unity after victory.
However, the long-brewing National Games has not yet been concretely decided, and whether it can be held is still a question; the main reason is that the funds are huge, and the government is afraid that it will not be able to cope with it. However, the holding of this National Games is of great significance and has a great impact on the future sports undertakings, ethos, and psychology in our country. The author sincerely hopes that the holding of this National Games can be realized. (To be continued)

Fair, Reasonable, and as Open as Possible; The Principles for Reviewing Applications Were Decided by the Transportation Management Executive Committee Yesterday; Striving to Support Industry and Commerce to Cooperate with Economic Measures
[Our Newspaper] The position of Chairman of the Executive Committee of the Transportation Management Committee was recently concurrently assumed by Mr. Zhang Jia-ji, President of the Central Bank. Mr. Zhang has always been extremely concerned about the promotion of committee affairs. It is reported that immediately after taking office, he additionally hired industry and commerce magnates such as Wu Yun-chu, Chairman of the National Industry and Commerce Association, Li, Chairman of the Shanghai Banking Association, and Xu Ji-lian, Chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, as consultants to the Executive Committee. The aim is to broadly consult and gather extensive benefits from various sectors. Yesterday (18th) at 5:00 PM, the 26th Executive Committee meeting was held at the Central Bank. In addition to the original members of the committee, Liu Gong-yun, Vice President of the Central Bank, Shao Zeng-hua, Deputy Director of the Business Bureau, and representatives from various countries were invited to attend the meeting. During the meeting, Mr. Zhang first expressed his importance to the applications for importing accessories, supplementary parts, and machine tools in Appendix (1) Production Equipment Category. He believes that achieving the goal of reconstruction and development cannot be easily achieved without importing the aforementioned equipment. He has ordered his subordinates to expedite the handling. At present, cotton, a raw material urgently needed by various textile industries to maintain production, has also been carefully reviewed by specialized committees. Under the principle of reasonable supply and demand, the import of 23,000 bales was approved. Regarding the applications in Appendix (3), there are currently more than 6,000 pieces, with no fewer than hundreds of names. The competent department has also been ordered to expedite the review based on factual needs. In short, in the future, the review of any application must weigh the importance and urgency, and strive for fairness and reasonableness, and also be as open as possible in principle. Therefore, industry

Spring and Autumn Yearnings -- Feng Li

Oh God, bring calamity upon me!
I killed an innocent lamb,
Friends of youth, curse me!
I destroyed a pure soul.

I joined D Company a week before its opening, while Jie Jin D Company joined the day before. When I first met Jie, I thought he was a happy young man with neat clothes and a smiling face. At that time, I didn't intend to get to know him.

We were all busy working for the company's upcoming opening. When I finished my work, I went to see Jie to get some fresh air. He still had so much work to do that I couldn't help but sympathize with him, so I casually said, "Still so much to write?" Jie replied, "Yes, I must finish writing it today." This was the beginning of our conversation.

For the company's opening, I was temporarily assigned to manage the microphone, and Jie was also assigned to work in the microphone room. After the ribbon-cutting ceremony, the shopping mall was very lively. I wanted to see the grand occasion, but I couldn't leave the microphone. Jie was willing to take care of it for me for a while and let me go out to play. At that time, I wondered why someone as happy as him didn't like crowds. Later, I realized that he had his reasons.

The company provided dinner for the first three days of the opening. On the second night after dinner, Jie accompanied me home. The moon was full that night, and we walked slowly. When we reached my doorstep, I didn't dare to go in. I was afraid he would know my home. After we walked a considerable distance, I said "See you tomorrow!" and then turned around and walked away. Jie smiled, as if he understood my meaning, and left without looking back. I thought Jie was very cute.

One day, Jie wanted to invite me to see a movie. "When I thought about seeing a movie, I immediately thought about how unnatural it would be for Jie to sit next to me. So I replied to him: "Seeing a movie, what a difficult question to answer! Because I always go alone. Although I dare not refuse your kindness, I cannot accept your suggestion. I can only say thank you, I'm sorry. I sincerely hope that you don't lose the chance to have fun because of me." Therefore, Jie didn't go. I felt very sorry.

I like music, and Jie wanted to invite me to listen to music. He asked Mr. Liu, who sat next to him, to buy two tickets at the Lyceum Theatre when he went home. I asked Mr. Liu to buy only one ticket. Mr. Liu said he was unwilling to buy one because buying one could not compensate for the loss of the shoes. In the end, no tickets were bought. Again, I felt too sorry for Jie. He lost another chance to have fun because of me.

One day, I wrote a note to Jie, "I am very sorry, because I don't want to look for trouble, and I don't want to disappoint you. The world is so big, why did you choose me?"

Jie replied, "You are really smart, you guessed it. When I first met you, I had this idea. I felt that it was God's will, but I didn't dare to express it to you soon after we met. Now that you have explained it, let's not talk about that problem for the time being. If there is a possibility in the future, let's talk about it again."

I replied to him, "I hope you don't hope so. I can tell you that there is absolutely no possibility, because I like you, so I give you a hint in advance, so as not to disappoint you in the future."

After that, we always walked together when we got off work. We often detoured to the International Cemetery. Young people like cemeteries. We criticized one tomb after another. I said, "I would like to choose a piece of land here to sleep, would you come to worship me?" Jie said, "I'm sorry, I can't worship you, I have to go first!" We looked at each other.

The company also worked on Sunday afternoons and provided lunch. One day I was late and missed lunch. I met Jie, and Jie asked me, "Have you eaten?" I instinctively replied, "I haven't eaten, treat me!" Jie immediately replied, "Okay." I knew I said the wrong thing, I shouldn't have been so frank and given him the opportunity. I quickly said that I had eaten. He didn't believe me and insisted on treating me. He said, "You said you didn't eat, I'll treat you." I couldn't get through, and I was very regretful. When I got to the door of the dining room, I was still a little unwilling, but on the one hand, I was hungry. I thought this might be fate, so I didn't dare to violate God's will. In the dining room, Jie sat opposite me, smoking a cigarette and drinking coffee. I suddenly remembered a sentence from Plato, "A woman's ability to eat is ugly." I looked at Jie. Jie didn't look at me. He was really cute.

Jie has always been serving me. Once, my drawer was broken, and Jie lowered his head to repair it for me. His tie was caught by the drawer's wooden board, but he didn't know it. I said, "Look at your tie!" Jie took a look and said, "Oh dear," and he laughed himself. Therefore, I liked that tie very much—a red tie with white dots.

Jie had given me many things. I really felt ashamed to accept them. I said to him, "You have given me too many things. I am afraid that it will be a loss to you." He said, "I am satisfied that you can accept my things." Until Jie gave me the last thing, I was really scared. I didn't know that his feelings for me had unconsciously entered a dead end. It was really because I was too careless.

One day, Jie gave me a letter with a piece of jade attached. The letter said:

"...Now I give you something, it is my heart. Look at how meaningful the carvings on it are! Please don't disappoint me."

I quickly picked up the piece of jade and looked at it. A pair of mandarin ducks was carved on it. My hand trembled, and the piece of jade fell on the table. I panicked and tried to calm down. I slowly picked it up and looked at it carefully. Fortunately, it didn't break at all, otherwise I would definitely have to accept it.

I wrote back a letter. I said: "Trouble has finally arrived. The beautiful noun of friendship is deceptive, and human selfishness is an instinct. I am not a person for marriage. I love freedom. If you think that there is no friendship between men and women, then goodbye!"

I saw Jie in the company. He was dressed very nicely, in a white suit, wearing that red tie with white dots, and smiling. I was very happy, thinking that all the troubles were gone. This day was a stormy night. I woke up from a dream in the middle of the night. It was pitch black outside the window. Listening quietly to the violent wind and rain, I felt a nameless fear in my heart. I carefully searched for the cause of this fear, but I couldn't find any clue. I felt that there was nothing that could make me afraid. The next day, Jie didn't come. I asked Mr. Liu and learned that he was sick. He was in very good health, how could he get sick? Could it be that my letter made him angry? If so, I am really sorry for him.

The news of Jie's death finally came. I was very surprised. How could Jie die so quickly? At this time, Jie's letter also arrived. I felt very sad looking at his envelope. I quickly opened it. It was written on airmail stationery. When I unfolded the stationery, a photo fell out. I looked at his photo, and tears immediately welled up. In the blurry vision, I read his letter:

"Li:

You will no longer have troubles, because a young man who troubled you will definitely leave you and never meet you again.

I wish you eternal happiness!

Jie's last words
Month Date, 3 a.m."

Then I picked up the photo and turned it over. It said:

"He sacrificed because of his affection. You loved him when he was alive. Please keep him well after his death."

My Pen -- Zhong Yuan

I am tired. I lean my head, tilt my body, and lie diagonally against the headboard. My tired eyes look from the headboard, I see, on the table by the window, my pen is quietly placed.

My pen is already old. The black and shiny barrel has turned grayish-yellow. The copper pen clip has a green tinge. A corner of the wide pen cap has already broken. The smooth pen tip has been worn round and clumsy, and it is covered in rust.

But my pen is good. It is a faithful companion, and it has been with me for twelve years. Twelve years ago, I was still studying at school. One day a friend came to see me, telling me that he was going to France to work, and he didn't know when he would be able to come back. But he told me not to cry. He took a pen from his bag, put it in my hand, and said softly; "You must use this pen to write to me, forever and ever"!

I couldn't write to him "forever and ever," but I have kept this pen ever since.

I have kept this pen, and I have used it to write millions of words. When I am happy, I use it to express the joy in my heart. When I am in pain, I use it to vent the depression in my chest. When I am lonely, I use it to dispel loneliness. When I am sick, I get comfort from it. Finally, in the days of hunger and cold, relying on it, I was able to spend six of the most difficult years half-warm and half-fed!

During the difficult days, I became a cowardly coward, and my pen also became a cowardly coward with me. I knelt to hunger, begged for mercy from illness, and issued a humble tremor to the rumbling cannons and the raging fire. My pen, also in its anxious state, knelt to the cold, begged for mercy from poverty, and issued a humble tremor to the rumbling cannons and the raging fire.

My pen, countless times with me in the raging wind and rain, eagerly wanted to be a brave warrior, wanted to raise its head, straighten its body, and push its straight chest forward with big strides. But the cannons came, the fire came, and the cataclysmic tides surged in! I had no armor on my body, and no iron in my hands. In the end, I could only lower my head and sigh helplessly; my pen also lowered its head with me and sighed helplessly.

My pen has praised the bright flowers in the spring garden, and it has also mourned the stiff corpses on the frozen snow. My pen tip has entered the magnificent paradise, and it has also delved into the miserable hell. On a starless and moonless night, I imagined that my pen barrel could be like an all-powerful magic wand, and with a wave of my hand, scatter bright sparks all over the sky to illuminate the world. I also silently prayed under the red wine and green lights that my pen tip could be like a powerful giant bomb, and with a gentle fall, release a field of fire to burn all arrogance and hypocrisy. I have built a magnificent pavilion for my pen tip, and I have decorated the four corners of the pavilion with children's laughter and a loving mother's song. I have also dredged a wide river for my pen tip, and I have embellished the monotony of the river bank with the blood of brave men and the tears of heroes. I once wished that my pen barrel could become a hard sword, aiming at Satan's poisonous neck and slashing hard. I also once wished that my pen barrel could become a gentle flute, echoing the angel's silver flute, on a moonlit night that was like a painting....

My pen, dark and old, grayish-yellow; but it is a faithful companion, and it has been with me for twelve years!

My pen, small and weak; but it has given me life and hope, and awakened my soul for twelve years!

I am tired. Now I lie silently in bed, my pen is quietly placed on the table. But in a little while, when my energy is full, I will stand up from the bed and lift my pen with more powerful arms! (Sent from Songjiang in March of the 36th year)

Listening to the Waterfall Among the Pines -- Zhao Tongyin

Low Whispers -- Huang Zongjin

I remember when I was a child, once, I was fast asleep on my mother's sewing table. When I woke up, the surroundings were so quiet that it seemed like there were only the two of us in this world. I said:

Mom, I also dreamed of flying.

Yes, you will fly one day.

At this moment, my mother shed tears, whispering about the sorrow of fate, one tear for each stitch, still mending my torn clothes. Then I felt a kind of terrible lonely pain and threw myself into my mother's arms, wailing.

After that, mother, I wandered in the north and south of the country with a lonely heart. Strangers and hypocrisy were always swirling around me...

However, I think I am still happy. I should be warmer than anyone else. Because that comrade in the green vest carrying the mailbag, there, across thousands of mountains and rivers, brought me my mother's warm words.

But, mother, now I am walking alone on the winter village road. The withered grass on the roadside mocks me, and countless prostrate tombs also open their stone doors, tempting me:

"Here is the door, come here and you will be warm."

At that time, I heard the peaceful snoring of the sleepers and the footsteps of the white clouds above my head...

Ah, mother, should the winter road be short? The end of the road should be woven with blooming flowers and lush grass, and the singing of larks, a warm spring of Liyang...

Last night, I dreamed that I was kneeling in front of the Virgin Mary. I, with holy hands, held them high, asking her to give me the seeds of ardent love, and asking her to give me a clear prophecy, saying that sowing in winter will sprout, bloom in spring...

Maria, Virgin Mary, lowered her shy head, as if the past surfaced in her heart again.

Alas, why can't I get my wish even in a dream? I cried, and my turbulent tears rowed the small boat of life to the shore of awakening...

Opening my drowsy eyes, I saw a golden star in the dark night sky outside the window, propping up the bright lamp of life. It, ah, loves the land so deeply, and thus has aroused my maternal warmth and remembrance.

Divination and Other -- Fang Zhou

Divination

Fate is a cunning snake,
When you try to catch it—
It slips away from your fingers like water.

Don't imagine that a "spade knight"
Will bring you good luck,
And a "queen of hearts"
Tells you of a happy love;
Because the composition of life is originally a string of coincidences
And thousands of seductive mazes,
There is laughter and tears,
But God has never arranged "absolute."

Pick the most beautiful flower!
Friends, because tomorrow—
It will wither forever from your heart.

Encounter Grass

Like a shooting star gliding across the sky,
The most unforgettable thing is your light smile;
The waltz rises like smoke from the accordion,
From your eyes
I realized the beauty of the daffodil.

Still remember the low cry before leaving?
Beside your temples,
Someone tremblingly inserted a carnation;
For fear that you have quietly wiped away the half-smile on your lips,
I am contemplating the forgotten verses.

Grave Worship -- Mo Zhi

On the second day of returning to my hometown, my elderly father urged me to go to the graveyard to worship the tombs of my ancestors. To show my filial piety as a returning wanderer, I readily agreed.

Although it was a short time away from home, the courtyard immediately presented a cold and quiet appearance. My old, white-haired mother stood alone at the gate, gazing at the desolate wilderness.

In the afterglow of the setting sun, the winter's end wilderness was particularly cold and desolate, and my heart was throbbing with sadness. My father walked silently, and I followed behind him in silence, holding money paper and sacrificial dishes. Although the shadows of childhood often floated up, my heart was always heavy. Stepping into the edge of the graveyard, three or five crows flew up from behind the tombs, croaking. This miserable crow's cry forced the hot tears floating in my heart to gush out.

I left home and passed through this cruel and long time. Several members of my family have passed away. A little sister died in a famine year, my eldest brother died under the strafing of enemy machine guns, and my third aunt died of old age. Ruthless time, famine, and enemies ended their lives; today, cups of loess cover their bodies, grief...

Seeing my grieving silence, my father hid aside as if to prevent more sadness from attacking, imagining himself completely immersed in the broken memories of the past. No, he was feeling the desolation of life!

I lit incense candles in front of my grandfather's grave, arranged the sacrificial dishes, knelt down reverently, and burned the money paper. When I kowtowed, the money paper was blown away by the wind, and I couldn't help but feel even more sad. After a moment of silence, I went to worship the graves of my aunt, elder brother, and little sister. At this time, my childhood life surged like a tide, and my soul seemed to be thrown into the dark and mysterious realm. My grandparents stroked my forehead with gentle hands, my aunt also stumbled over and came to ask about my well-being, my brother held my sister's hand, also as if welcoming me home...

"The most pitiful death was your sister," my father approached me, tears in his eyes. "When she was sick, she wanted to eat noodles, but it was a famine year. The family used leaves and elm bark to survive. Where were there noodles for her? For this matter, your mother ran around, but she couldn't get any. She could only deceive her with words: 'When your second brother comes home, he will bring them to you, wait a little longer...' In the coma before her death, she still asked: 'Has second brother come back?' Your mother just cried..."

My father sadly narrated, wiping away his tears with his trembling right hand.

"What about my elder brother?" I changed the topic to reduce my father's grief.

"His death seemed to be destined. Your sister-in-law was at her mother's house, and he had to go visit her. On the way, he was shot by a devil's machine gun, and he was already dead when he was carried home." My father sighed.

Recalling the two years before I left home, my elder brother and sister-in-law were as close as one person, and they often joined forces to oppose my mother. I thought that when my elder brother was lying stiff in the coffin, my sister-in-law's tears must have been more than anyone else's.

The pale yellow sunlight shone weakly from the depression in the western mountains, disappearing like an old man on his deathbed, breathing heavily. The graveyard had already darkened. I packed up the sacrificial dishes and followed behind my father's back to go home.

The evening wind howled, and the earth slept quietly.

One Inch of Mountain, One Inch of River, One Inch of Blood -- 202 Ye Jingfeng

The above conflict of thoughts, one positive and one negative, in my heart, was only like lightning, flashing and becoming a thing of the past. Perhaps this point had already been seen through by the extremely alert Mr. W, so as soon as I stood up, preparing to look for his device, he reached out and opened a drawer of the desk in front of him, fiddled with it, and immediately a radio-like sound came out. As soon as I heard the clear and round voice, I knew it was Pingzi speaking:

"Brother, you're wrong, she's not trying to impersonate Kawashima Yoshiko to scare you."

It turned out that they intended to discuss the matter of the fake "Commander Jin."

"Not the person, then why? This is the voice of Jian."

Ping—Fang Shi this fellow has her consistent style. The few subordinates she selects and trains, as long as they are women, are considered her substitutes. So no matter where they go, as long as the other party doesn't recognize them, they will carry out the stinky card of "Fangzi."

Crane—What's the purpose, besides scaring people?

Ping—The first purpose is that she herself doesn't have to work outside, but the credit is readily available. Second, this kind of work is like holding life in the palm of your hand. If a subordinate is sacrificed, her name will add another layer of glory to her superiors. There is also a third point, she does this as a technique in her work, at least to make the other party confused, not knowing who the real Fangzi is...

Crane—That fellow probably doesn't know my background?

Ping—I think they are very clear.

Crane—Then why deliberately mess with me?

Ping—I think there are two points—

Crane—First point?

Ping—Deliberately messing with you, because Doihara will not let you go, although you also participated in the Black Dragon Society, it is because Konoe values you too much.

Crane—Ha... what's the second point?

Ping—The second point is even more dangerous; although I have not heard them—Matsui, Sakai, Imai, Fangzi, Fujio, these people—although I have not heard them say that you are associating with "suspicious people"...

Crane—What?... They are monitoring me?

Ping—Most likely... but it is not necessary to monitor, just ask you why you live here?

Crane—Hmph?... Why can't I live here? Aren't you here too?

Ping—I don't have to be afraid of them, because my mission is short-term, Brother, you can't say that!

L. Tolstoy's Quotations -- Translated by Jin Ning

In our world, all living people should not only possess the truth, but at least have the belief of knowing the truth, and it is best to pursue the truth of the laws of human life with firm determination and possible opportunities.

Random Talks in Dubei -- Wang Cong

The Chinese people like to find a few historical heroes among people with the same surname as their ancestors. People with the surname Wen must claim to be descendants of Wen Tianxiang. In fact, Mr. Wenshan's bloodline has long been cut off.

Mr. Kong Er is obviously progressive in this concept. He said: "The ploughing ox with variegated hair, though it has horns, who would sacrifice to the mountains and rivers for it?”

Yu was the son of a whale, and Zhou was a descendant of Shang Tang; honor and disgrace rest only on oneself. This is not like being an official; there is nothing to rely on.

I oppose all people who climb up through reproductive relationships.

A desire for fame is not entirely a bad thing; it only depends on the attitude towards life and the path taken.

Qu Yuan said: "Old age is approaching, I fear that I will not establish a good name."

Kong Zhongni said: "The gentleman is grieved that he dies without a name worthy of him." Of course, it is the most beautiful and greatest work to create a brilliant rainbow for the sky of history.

As for killing people and then hypocritically laughing loudly to seek a good name; it is always heartbreaking.

As for the rainbow in the world, he cannot, and in fact does not need to, call out the sleeping ghosts behind the blinds to admire his own brilliance.

Kong Zhongni still has a good saying: "The gentleman is grieved that he is incompetent, not that others do not know him."

In the Literary Giant Film "Karmic Fate," the Newcomer Gay Madison Avoids Hiring Relatives -- Chang Kong

People have established a personnel system and achieved high work efficiency.

But we, the descendants of the five-thousand-year-old Chinese nation, have never been able to get rid of the "personal"-centered "family style." Whether it is an institution, a school, or a group, as long as there is such a "square seal" or a "strip stamp," you can always hear the "native language" of "one family" inside and out, from the doorman to the "internal affairs." As for their relationship, it goes without saying, wife's father, wife's uncle, wife's brother, nephew, niece, niece's husband, occupy the entire institution; messenger, document clerk, secretary, cashier, general affairs... which one is not a character taken out of "one's own" pocket?

Some people say: This is the microcosm of the Chinese officialdom. This statement still covers half the shame for the Chinese people; in fact, the Chinese nation does everything for "personal" and "family" consideration.

The Buddhist saying: "If one person becomes a Buddha, even his chickens and dogs ascend to heaven." In the Chinese officialdom of past dynasties, it has become a common practice that as long as one member of a family rises to prominence, all five relatives and four clans flock to him, which makes the situation terrible!

Under the premise of cleaning up the political atmosphere, this kind of family-style politics should be strictly prohibited.

The transfer of a province, a county, an institution, or a leader often causes the entire organization to stop working for two or three months due to the entire transfer of personnel.

What kind of talk is this!

In the method of appointing civil servants decided by the Ministry of Personnel yesterday, there is a special regulation that the head of an agency should avoid employing spouses, blood relatives, and relatives by marriage; this is a "prescription" aimed at the current situation in China! I hope this bowl of yellow soup can save the incurable disease of familyization in Chinese institutions, and at the same time wash away the dirty "family style" of the Chinese officialdom and all institutionalized groups and schools!

Airplane Ticket Prices Have Risen -- Can Flight Safety Be Guaranteed? -- Gao Wuhong

Since Christmas Eve last year, Santa Claus has brought bad luck to airplanes. Airplane accidents have occurred one after another. Passengers have suffered "unexpected disasters," with deaths, injuries, cries shaking the sky, and the tragedy is unbearable to hear. Investigating responsibility, requesting compensation, accusations from the families of the victims, accusations from public opinion... after a period of uproar, there was no effect. From that time on, airplanes have really become a "crisis." A perfectly good airplane flies out and crashes, and people regard the shortcut of air routes as a dangerous road, avoiding it like a scorpion. If you don't want to be sent to the "Western Paradise" as soon as you take to the sky, you have to try flying with the "great fearless" spirit of "regarding death as home."

Now, although not long after, it can be regarded as "the matter has passed." The dead are dead, and the impression these events have left on people has gradually faded away. The China Central and China National Aviation Corporations, which had been suspended for many days, have been ordered to resume domestic flights on the morning of the 16th of this month. China National Aviation Corporation flew out 18 passenger and cargo planes, and China Central Aviation Corporation flew out 7 passenger and cargo planes. At the same time, the long-rumored increase in airplane ticket prices has also been received by the two companies on the day before the resumption of flights with an order from the Ministry of Communications: "Permission to increase by 150% or 200% at its discretion," and implemented at the same time as the resumption of flights.

This year's increase in state-owned transportation tools can be regarded as the first sound. Probably because the two companies have been suspended for many days, resulting in heavy losses, so they are "specially allowed to increase prices to make up for the losses." They can recoup some of the losses on the heads of passengers. The increase in airplane prices will naturally lead other trains and ships to "follow suit" soon. A friend of the author's wanted to go to Calcutta last winter. At first, airplanes kept crashing. It wasn't that he was timid, but his wife was worried. The trip was delayed again and again. Later, the airplanes were simply grounded. Recently, a letter came from that side urging him to go there once. He was preparing to take a plane when the route was restored. He heard that the ticket price had more than doubled, and he shouted "Hard injury"! The three losses in terms of time, career, and money are all impossible to calculate.

Although taking an airplane is dangerous, it is still the most convenient and fastest means of transportation, which can save a lot of trouble. People with business cannot avoid taking it because of the crisis; moreover, according to superstition, encountering this kind of thing is "destined," otherwise it would be as difficult as winning the lottery to "meet the opportunity."

Airplanes have resumed flights, and ticket prices have increased by 150% to 200%, but I don't know if the authorities of the two companies have also made substantial improvements to the safety guarantee for passengers. I hope that they can also provide passengers with 100% safety like the ticket prices, because people used to take airplanes as if they had entrusted their lives to the airline authorities, and their fate was left to fate.

The spring is bright, the sky is clear, and I wish that the flights of airplanes after the soaring ticket prices can be effectively guaranteed.

Foreign Employees

Big tycoons like to use foreign employees, regarding them as treasures! Pier management, preferential treatment in trade, high salaries in gold coins!

Foreign houses and high allowances, foreign moons, how beautiful? Foreign employees are arrogant, Chinese employees sigh—everyone is a "foreign fool"!

Note: The China National Aviation Corporation employs a British man as the pier manager, with a monthly salary of more than 100 pounds, an allowance of more than 2 million national currency, and gives him a house worth 12,000 US dollars to live in.

Saying of Lang Cao Duanfang—History of Extravagance and Corruption in the Late Qing Officialdom, Part Two -- Ai Ju

Enjoying gold, jade, brocade, and embroidery is greed. Even a fondness for calligraphy, painting, metalwork, and stone carvings is also greed.

In the Qing Dynasty, a saying went around about handsome men among the banner people: Da Rong Xiao Na Duan Lao Si. Na refers to the Chancellor Xuan, and Duan refers to the Governor-General of Zhili, Wuqiao. I forgot who Rong was. Na and Duan were both my colleagues in the History Compilation Hall. Na's father and my late father were born in the same year, Ji You, and Na was also my elder brother's classmate in the Yi You year. Duan was a Secretary in the Ministry of Works and was recommended by my late father as first-class in the Beijing Inspection. Therefore, Na and Duan were very familiar with me, and Duan even insisted on becoming sworn brothers with the three of us brothers. (My brothers disliked this bad habit the most, so Duan could only do it by force).

After Duan was dismissed as Governor-General of Zhili, he lived in Banmu Garden in Huangmi Hutong, only a wall away from me. At that time, I was an official in the Ministry of War. After the morning court, almost every day we visited each other, or if something prevented me from going on some days, he would send someone to invite me to appreciate calligraphy and painting together.

Now I will describe Duan's life, which can be divided into three eras. One was the era when he was a Secretary in the Ministry; the second was the era from being Circuit Intendant of Bachang to Governor-General of Hubei and Governor-General of Jiangnan; and the third was the era of being Governor-General of Zhili and his retirement and murder.

When he first showed his talent as a Secretary in the Ministry, my late father was the Minister of Works and greatly appreciated his talent, saying that he and Tie Bao Chen (Liang) were truly the two outstanding talents in the Ministry. Therefore, the two of them were promoted to first-class in the Beijing Inspection during my late father's tenure and were listed as his disciples. (Those who get first-class are usually called disciples). Wuqiao inherited the style of Bo Xi, the Grand Sacrificer, and admired elegance very much, especially liking to associate with deep people. Therefore, Zhang Zhengwen (Yun Ge) in the Jia Wu year and Kang Liang Shen (Meisou) in the Wu Xu year were all very close friends. Duan even claimed to be a Han Chinese with the surname Tao. At that time, he liked to collect newly unearthed steles the most, most of which were epitaphs, planting them all over the courtyard where he lived, as if in a mass burial; he often rubbed them and gave them to people, which was truly a first-class product. When he heard that someone had fine calligraphy and paintings, he would visit and ask to see them, and sometimes he would even secretly take them by trickery. After Bo Xi died, a small number of his collections also returned to his box. He liked to indulge in licentiousness. Koudai Hutong in the Western City was home to many impoverished banner people who were private prostitutes. Duan sometimes even went to their places in full official attire, which was ridiculous. During the Wu Ji year, the party members were killed, and Tang Liang fled. Duan then transformed himself into a singer of moralistic songs, printing them and sending them to friends (the content of the songs was to be loyal to the emperor and love the country, and to oppose the arguments of the Wu Xu party members). Through Li Lianying, he reached Empress Dowager Cixi. Cixi read it with great joy, and Duan was then recorded in the Beijing Inspection and appointed as Circuit Intendant of Bachang in Zhili. Can it not be said that he was extremely alert? (To be continued)

Lamenting the Two-Headed Monster Baby—I am Sad for Their Fate and Happy for Their Relief -- Wang Hou

The Yang surname monster baby, born with two bodies, died at the same time because the one on the left suddenly suffered from pneumonia, which affected the one on the right. They lived for about eight months. There is no definite conclusion on how long such a monster baby can live. I remember that there was once a pair in Siam, but they lived to adulthood. Then the Yang surname monster baby was a premature death, which is why it is sad.

God created Adam and Eve, both with clean and complete bodies, but the monster baby had a whimsical idea, with two bodies merged together, which has the suspicion of surpassing the craftsmanship of God, so its death may be a punishment from God.

After the monster baby was born, it was put on display. It is said that business was booming and the threshold was crowded, and the monster baby got sick because it couldn't stand the fatigue (reported like this), and died. But thinking about it the other way around, the number of people the monster baby faced in eight months was already quite a lot, or even more than the number of people some people see in their lifetime (especially since it has two pairs of eyes). The money it earned for its owner in eight months was even more than some people earn in their lifetime, so even though it only lived for eight months, it can be considered that it did not fail in this life and can rest in peace.

Moreover, at most, how long can such a monster baby live? One body, two souls (also two heads), I think if it really grows up to be an adult, the inconvenience felt in its body must be far less than the pain caused by the conflict of its two souls.

Superstitious people must say that this child committed sins in its previous life, so God gave it the pain of two heads. Humorous people would say that these are two children rushing to be reincarnated. God couldn't tell the first from the second for a while, so he could only let them both come out together (ordinary twins also have a sequence), which can be regarded as a punishment for their lack of humility.

In short, it is clearly one body, but it has to be forcibly divided into two, divided but not separated, which is really a kind of pain, a kind of divine punishment, a monster.

I am sad for the fate of the monster baby, and I am also happy for the monster baby's relief.

The Secret of Prosperity -- Translated by Jingchu

In its recent report to its members, the American Federation of Labor has the following effective and correct opinion. Although this opinion seems like ordinary common sense, it is indeed the biggest factor in the prosperity of the United States:

Increasing work efficiency is to increase the wages of workers; reduce the prices of products; win sales markets; and make you have a more stable job. The traditional method of increasing wages in the United States is to increase its productivity. This method not only makes the cost increase, but also makes the people's living standards increase accordingly.

### The Eastern Mongolian Autonomous Government Reportedly Reappears

[Our Correspondent, Beiping, 18th] According to information obtained by Mongolians in Beiping, an autonomous government has reappeared in eastern Mongolia, located in the Hailar area. However, in the early years, the Eastern Mongolian Autonomous Government was established, and later, under the instigation of Communist Yunze, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Movement Joint Association was established to merge the east and west. The original Eastern Mongolian Autonomous Government was changed to the Feng'an Provincial Government. After the CCP failed in Chahar and Rehe, the Xing'an Provincial Government has somehow changed into a form of autonomous government. Those who captured Kailu at the end of October were the joint forces of the Eastern Army and the Communist Army, totaling 65,000 troops. This is the first time the Eastern Mongolian Army has appeared on the domestic battlefield, so its significance is quite serious. The slogan of the Communist and Mongolian armies this time is to eliminate Li Shouxin's Rehe People's Self-Defense Army and block traffic to destroy spring plowing. Kailu was originally a protruding area of ​​the National Army's defense line, so only a small number of Li Shouxin and the 93rd Army of the National Army were stationed there. When the Communist and Mongolian armies suddenly rushed to attack the headquarters of the People's Self-Defense Army, Li disguised himself and broke through, barely escaping with his life.

### Dong Yingbin Flies to Beiping and Transfers to Shenyang; The US Attitude Towards the Dalian Issue Remains Unchanged and Still Hopes that the Soviet Union Will Immediately Return It to Our Country

[Our Correspondent, Nanjing, 18th] Dong Yingbin, who came to Nanjing to request instructions on the matter of taking over Dalian, completed his official business in Nanjing and left Nanjing by plane for Beiping and transferred to Shenyang on the morning of the 18th.

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 17th] A State Department spokesman said that the United States had not yet received an official report to confirm that the Soviet Union intends to transfer Dalian to the Chinese government. The attitude currently held by the United States is still the same as that expressed in its note to the Soviet and Chinese governments on January 3. The United States still believes that the Soviet Union has no reason not to immediately return the port of Dalian to the Chinese authorities for management in accordance with the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance of August 14, 1945. It is hoped that the situation in Dalian will soon return to normal so that American citizens can go there to live and resume their activities.
