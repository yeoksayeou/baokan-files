### Wedemeyer Urges Increased Aid to China, Presents Views at Senate Appropriations Committee, Truman Signs Emergency Aid to Europe Bill

[Our Dispatch] New York, 17th (Broadcast) Washington dispatch, General Wedemeyer stated his views at the Senate Appropriations Committee on the 17th, believing that Chairman Chiang is "the reasonable leader of China today," urging the United States to increase aid to China without any bias, and hoping that China can make effective use of this aid. Wedemeyer said: "Whether Chiang is a benevolent dictator or a democratic leader, I don't think it matters. The most important point is that he has always opposed the Communist Party." He further stated: Chiang Kai-shek could have made peace with Japan on "extremely favorable terms" at the height of the Pacific War, which would have allowed Japan to dispatch "1.5 million troops to fight against the Americans," but Chiang "always kept faith with the Allies, and his high character is admirable." When asked whether the United States should immediately provide military supplies and economic assistance to China, Wedemeyer strongly stated, "I think it should." He said: Chiang "needs and deserves help." Chiang has always abided by the agreements made with our country, and if I were Chiang, I would be extremely impatient with the United States. Wedemeyer believes that the surplus military supplies piled up by the United States in various parts of the Pacific are not suitable for China, because what China needs are light weapons. He told the committee that before he left China, Chiang had assured him of two points: China will continue to oppose communism, and will try to establish a democratic government, but whether a democratic government can be established depends on the attitude of the Soviet Union, the attitude of the United States, and whether the economy can be stabilized. Wedemeyer declined to disclose the contents of the China visit report, because the President ordered him to keep it secret, and if the committee forced him to explain the details, it would put him in an "embarrassing situation." Although Wedemeyer did not directly mention the name of the Soviet Union in his speech, he said that the United States is facing an opposing ideological force all over the world. The United States must stop the expansion of this force and then re-enter the areas affected by this force. [Our Dispatch] New York, 17th (Broadcast): Washington dispatch, President Truman signed the $597 million Emergency Aid to Europe Relief Bill on the 17th without holding a ceremony. The President is expected to make a statement at a press conference on the afternoon of the 18th. It is also reported that Truman plans to submit a long-term aid to Europe plan to Congress on Friday.

### U.S. House Appropriations Committee Decides to Temporarily Withhold Aid to China Funds

[United Press Washington, 16th] The U.S. House Appropriations Committee submitted a bill to the House on the 16th that would cut $88 million from the total amount of emergency foreign aid approved by Congress and temporarily withhold aid to China funds. The bill also recommends that the U.S. Army reduce the cost of maintaining occupied areas by $260 million. The committee submitted a supplementary appropriation bill, which included the following:

590 million US dollars are allocated for emergency foreign aid, which is 15% less than the relief funds for Italy, Austria, and China approved on the 15th.

Of the 490 million US dollars requested by the Army for relief and military government expenses in Germany, Japan, Korea, and Austria, only 230 million US dollars are allocated, a reduction of 53%. Chairman Taber of the House Appropriations Committee said that the reason why the committee did not allocate funds to China was because the funds would not be used until Secretary of State Marshall submitted his plan. The committee's report quoted Republican Congressman Judd as saying: "Until Marshall submits his plan, I do not believe that the Appropriations Committee has a responsibility to allocate funds to China, and in fact, this allocation should not occur."

[United Press Washington, 16th] The House Appropriations Committee's bill to cut foreign aid funding has been sent to the House for review. House Democratic members immediately expressed their opposition and attempted to restore the original amount. Even if the House approves the reduction and excludes China, the Senate may increase it and re-include China, pending a final decision by a joint conference of the two houses.

[United States Information Service Washington, 16th] The U.S. House Appropriations Committee today canceled the aid to China portion of the temporary aid bill, pending the government's proposal of a more specific aid to China plan. According to the Appropriations Committee, the $88 million deducted from today's temporary aid bill should be reserved for China or other approved plans.

### China and the United States Consult on Aid to China and the Japanese Peace Conference, Ambassador Gu Visits Assistant Secretary of State Elbrick

[United Press Washington, 16th] Chinese Ambassador to the United States Gu Weijun visited Assistant Secretary of State Elbrick on the 16th to discuss the United States' expedient aid to China plan and the Japanese peace conference, which lasted 80 minutes. After the meeting, Mr. Gu told reporters that China was very pleased that the United States' emergency aid plan included China, and hoped that aid to China "will not only end with this expedient aid." Gu's visit was before he learned that the House Appropriations Committee had removed China from the emergency aid list. It is possible that the House will overturn the Appropriations Committee's opinion and restore the original number of aid to China. It is said that after meeting with Elbrick this time, he felt that the United States had not completed the details of the long-term aid to China plan. According to Marshall, the number will be around 300 million yuan.

Mr. Gu said that China still hopes that the Soviet Union and China can agree to China's compromise proposal for the Japanese peace conference, that is, the members of the Far Eastern Commission should convene the Japanese peace conference, and the four powers should retain the veto power over the resolution. The United States has not yet responded to China's proposal, and the Soviet Union has not made any new proposals to China recently. Gu said that if China's compromise proposal on the procedure of the Japanese peace conference cannot be accepted by the Soviet Union and the United States, then we will have to carefully consider our position. When asked by reporters, "If the above situation occurs, will China agree to the British and American proposal that all countries participating in the war against Japan can participate in the Japanese peace conference, and all resolutions will be voted on by a two-thirds majority without veto power?" Gu replied that the "results" of this resolution must be considered. This main result is bound to be hindered by the Soviet Union's obstruction of the peace conference procedure. China must carefully consider its resolution, "because we and the Soviet Union are neighbors."

### Soviet Consul in Peiping Denies Alliance Between Communists and Soviets

[United Press Peiping, 17th] Soviet Consul in Peiping, Tie Weiqingsi, said on the night of the 16th that reports claiming that the Soviet Union had established a military agreement with the Chinese Communist Party were "nonsense."

It is claimed that: "We now recognize the National Government of China as the only government of China, so this agreement is impossible."

Huo Jishi, the sub-supervisor of the 26th Garrison Station, went to investigate yesterday and said that the warehouse director Wang Wenxian was ordered to submit scrap metal. Yesterday at 3:00 p.m., he led warehouse staff Li Guorui and Sergeant Zhang Zhiru to sort it out in the warehouse. A waste landmine suddenly exploded, and Wang Wenxian and the other two died on the spot. The warehouse is far away from other armories, so fortunately it was not affected, but the glass of houses near Xizhimen was mostly shattered, and an old woman passing by was slightly injured.

### Martial Law Begins in Shenyang Today, Bandit Troops Attempt to Break into Outer Perimeter Line, Major Battle May Occur Between Tieling and Faku

[Our Dispatch, Shenyang, 17th] The Shenyang Defense Command announced that martial law will begin on the 18th, prohibiting passage from 6:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m. the next morning. [Our Dispatch, Shenyang, 17th] The main force of the Communist bandits is now concentrating on the outer perimeter of Shenyang, attempting to break into the outer perimeter line to fight. The 1st, 2nd, and 7th Columns are scurrying around Tieling, Faku, and Xinmin, and the 6th Column also appears to be scurrying from Xi'an to Faku. More than 2,000 bandit Mongolian cavalry crossed the Liao River southward from the direction of Faku and destroyed the Shifosi on the south bank of Henan at night. This place is an important fortress in the north mountain area of Panyang, and the National Army is firmly defending it. Bandit crowds are also gathering in the Benxi and Fushun areas of southern Liaoning, and some are heading towards Liaoyang. According to the judgment of a certain military person in charge, a large-scale main battle may occur between Xinmin and Faku in ten days to two weeks. It is also said that the bandits' strategy this time will inevitably lead to a bad situation, because Shenyang has sufficient defensive and offensive power. Moreover, the bandits are scurrying around in this severe cold, and frostbite is inevitable, and their actions in the snow are even more restricted by aerial surveillance.

### Purchase of Transport Aircraft from the U.S. to be Formally Delivered Early Next Month, American Pilots Hired to Fly to Shanghai

[United Press Washington, 16th] The U.S. War Assets Administration announced today that China has negotiated the purchase of 150 Curtis C-46 aircraft from the Foreign Surplus Property Clearing Office.

The original price was about 300,000 yuan per aircraft, but now the price is only 5,000 yuan per aircraft, plus 4,000 yuan for refurbishment, which China will take care of itself. The aircraft are scheduled to be formally delivered around January 1 next year, and China will hire American pilots to fly them to Shanghai. Most of them flew over the Hump during the war to transport supplies from India to China, and are now stored in the Warner warehouse in Arkansas.

### Scientific Instruments Among Japanese Reparations, China Can Obtain 1,500 Pieces, First Batch of Reparations to Arrive Next Month

[United Press Tokyo, 17th] MacArthur Headquarters announced today that of the 3,000 pieces of scientific experimental instruments among the Japanese reparations, half are designated to be allocated to China, and the remaining half are allocated to the Netherlands, the Philippines, and the United Kingdom. [Our Dispatch] The Japanese Reparations Supervision Committee invited representatives from relevant departments yesterday to hold the second liaison meeting.

The bandits' attempt to pretend to gather four columns to attack Zhengzhou has been shattered by the National Army's internal and external attacks for several days. [Our Dispatch, Xuzhou, 17th] Liu Bandit's 11th Column, which fiercely attacked Lanfeng, has been strongly resisted by the defenders. Yesterday, it collapsed in the direction of Yanggujji (southwest of Lanfeng) and Luowangzhai and Duliangzhai (west of Lanfeng). Chen Bandit's 10th Column invaded the direction of Lanfeng from near Minquan yesterday. The National Army intercepted and annihilated more than 500 bandits. [Central News Agency, Kaifeng, 17th] More than 20,000 Communist bandits of Chen Yi's troops who invaded Xuchang have been resisted by our army and civilians.

### National Economic Commission to Formulate a Plan to Strengthen Control over Yarn and Cloth, Silk Spinning Association to Expand into Control Agency

[Central News Agency, Nanking, 17th] The National Economic Commission has agreed on four key points for changing the management of yarn and cloth: Cotton yarn should adopt a full-scale spinning method, and the weaving section should be implemented immediately. The government must control raw materials. Domestic raw cotton should be grasped as much as possible. In addition to the UN Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) raw cotton and the purchased foreign cotton, an appropriate portion of cotton yarn should be exported in exchange for foreign cotton. A planned allocation of yarn must be adopted for the cotton textile industry and the reproduction industry. The targets should be mainly the standard cloth for people's livelihood and the cotton textiles suitable for export. In order to implement the above principles, the existing Textile Industry Adjustment Committee will be reorganized into a control or management agency in order to strictly implement government policies. In addition, the existing Textile Adjustment Committee of the Ministry of Economic Affairs will be reorganized into the National Yarn and Cloth Management Committee, which is expected to be completed before the end of the year. [Another telegram] According to the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the amount of raw cotton currently controlled by the government is quite large. Combined with the cotton owned by various private and state-owned factories, it is more than enough to supply three months. As for cotton production, we have followed the planned plan and urged and promoted increased production in various cotton-producing areas. Once transportation is smooth and convenient, it will not be difficult to achieve self-sufficiency.

### The Purpose of Controlling Yarn and Cloth is to Safeguard the Interests of the People

Dong Xian Guang Elaborates on the Government's Intention [Central News Agency, Nanking, 17th]

Director Dong Xianguang said at a press conference on the 17th that the National Economic Commission was ordered to formulate a plan to strengthen the government's management of yarn and cloth. The current Textile Industry Allocation Committee will be reorganized and expanded into the Yarn and Cloth Management Committee, which will be established on New Year's Day next year. Yuan Liang will serve as the director of the committee. After the establishment of the new agency, yarn factories and weaving factories will produce for the government. The government guarantees that they will obtain reasonable profits in addition to paying for labor and other necessary expenses. The government will allocate cotton for spinning and weaving and will統購統銷统销（unified purchase and sale）. This is the general direction of the government's management. As for the goal of its implementation of management, it is not to establish a profit-making monopoly institution, but to safeguard the interests of the people and prevent speculation.

### The Four Joint Offices to Hold a Board Meeting Today to Change Loan Policy, Reduce Domestic Exchange Rate, Discuss Implementation Measures

[Our Dispatch, Nanking, 17th] Specific decisions on the loan issue of national banks and bureaus will be made on the morning of the 18th. The Four Joint Offices, which are responsible for reviewing loans, have decided to hold a meeting because of the suspension of loans last week. All directors will participate in the meeting at Guofu Bank at 8:00 a.m. on the 18th, and Chairman Chiang will personally preside over the meeting. The meeting will review past loan policies and decide on future loan directions. The Four Joint Offices held a preparatory meeting on the afternoon of the 17th to prepare for the meeting on the morning of the 18th. It is heard that the loan policy will be changed, so [Central News Agency, Nanking, 17th] Supervisory Committee member Li Shijun proposed a suggestion on the 7th of this month, requesting the Executive Yuan to stop general commercial loans and to strictly verify the use of industrial or other production loans to prevent abuses and stabilize finance. It is reported that Li's proposal has two points: Except for the international trade products that are the main exports of the country, such as raw silk, tung oil, and tea, loans should be strictly granted in accordance with the regulations. All other general commercial loans should be stopped immediately to avoid misappropriation and hoarding, which would affect the market and fluctuate prices. The scope of loans that meet the nature of industry and production may be relaxed, and the procedures may be simplified as much as possible. However, the use, raw material use, finished product sales, and price regulations should be strictly controlled and carefully audited in terms of time to prevent hoarding and speculation. This case has been transferred to the Executive Yuan for review by the Control Yuan. [Our Dispatch, Nanking, 17th] Recently, the National Economic Commission had a resolution to "reduce the domestic exchange rate to decentralize funds." According to the Ministry of Finance, the purpose of adjusting the exchange rate is to make funds flow inward, avoiding their concentration in large cities, creating speculation, and stimulating prices. The Ministry of Finance is now discussing with the Four Joint Offices to broaden the implementation measures.

### Citizens' Deposits in the United States Evaded on a Large Scale Twice

[Our Dispatch, Nanking, 17th] According to a government official who recently returned from the United States, citizens' foreign exchange deposits in the United States have been evaded on a large scale, which is the inevitable result of the long delay in requisitioning or declaring citizens' deposits abroad. It is claimed that this evasion has occurred twice. The first time was when the United States unfroze foreign deposits in the United States. Because there were rumors of requisition in China, a batch had been evaded. After the measures for declaring foreign exchange deposits of citizens abroad were formulated, the second batch followed suit. The method of evasion was either to withdraw cash and transfer it to other countries, or to entrust foreign friends to deposit it under an assumed name. Those who entrusted foreigners to deposit even paid a commission, and the amount of the commission even exceeded the interest on the deposit. Therefore, there are very few Chinese deposits in the United States now.

### Editorial: The Breakdown of the Foreign Ministers' Conference

After seventeen sessions in Washington, the Council of Foreign Ministers of the Four Powers adjourned indefinitely on the 15th. Subsequently, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov promptly returned to Moscow, marking an unhappy end to the conference. The transmission of this news is unsurprising. When this Council of Foreign Ministers convened in Washington on the 25th of last month, we already held little optimism for its prospects. We pointed out that the main topics of this conference were the German and Austrian questions: Austria's independence and the peace treaty with Germany. The German peace treaty included issues such as reparations, how to revive the German economy, and the organization of the German government. At the foreign ministers' meeting, there was no time to discuss the political organization of Germany, and even the issue of reviving the German economy made no progress because the deadlock over reparations could not be broken. On the surface, at least, the failure of this Foreign Ministers' Conference was due to the deadlock on the reparations issue, which forced the announcement of an indefinite adjournment. U.S. Secretary of State Marshall proposed this, and British Foreign Secretary Bevin and French Foreign Minister Bidault seconded it. At the final meeting on the 15th, Marshall bluntly stated that regarding the German reparations issue, "Only the Soviet Union firmly refuses to agree, so continuing the meeting is futile." British Foreign Secretary Bevin, after detailing his country's position, pointed out, "History will bear witness that we must now doubt whether the Foreign Ministers' Conference can ultimately resolve the problems of Europe and Germany." At the same time, Molotov declared: "Bevin's and Marshall's actions are clearly identical. Both have failed to adhere to the agenda and have ignored Soviet proposals. The French delegation has never dissented from what the United States and Britain have said, showing that Britain and France have taken a united front against Soviet reparations." He also stated: "The American delegation did not come to this meeting in good faith, and it had already decided to break up the Foreign Ministers' Conference and divide Germany into two parts."

Regarding reparations, the Soviet Union sought reparations of US$10 billion, calculated at 1938 values, which would be far more than US$15 billion at current values. Marshall stated that this was clearly contrary to the Potsdam Agreement and, from the perspective of practical economic principles, was impossible. Under such demands, an agreement among the Four Powers could only be reached by agreeing to enslave the German people and severely hinder the reconstruction of all of Europe. Regarding the Austrian treaty, the property and privileges demanded by the Soviet Union far exceeded what a free and independent Austria could bear. The Soviet Union consistently refused to provide essential and necessary information on the transfer of German reparations materials and refused to agree to hand over German property unilaterally seized under the guise of reparations. The Soviet Union's actions prevent Germany from fulfilling its role in the task of rebuilding Europe, and force Britain and the United States to provide substantial aid to West Germany to maintain its survival. Unexpectedly, the Soviet representative blamed the British and American aid as an attempt to use West Germany as a strategic base against European democratic countries and to promote expansionist policies. Under these circumstances, the Foreign Ministers' Conference was forced to announce an indefinite adjournment. Of course, we hardly need to point out that the difference between the West, as it's called by Britain and the United States, and the Soviet Union, does not lie in the issue of reparations, but in the more fundamental issues behind these reparations; however, this difference is expressed through the issue of reparations.

Now that the Foreign Ministers' Conference has broken down and adjourned indefinitely, when it can be reopened is unknown. Judging from the existing signs, even if the Foreign Ministers' Conference does not die from this, reopening it seems to require a considerable amount of time. The trend of dividing Germany, Europe, and even the entire world into two is becoming more apparent, and the future of the world is increasingly volatile. According to reports, while the Western powers are not likely to take immediate action, the following developments are feared to be unavoidable: France is expected to agree to merge its German occupation zone economically with the Anglo-American zone; Britain, the United States, and France will discuss the possibility of politically unifying West Germany as soon as possible, which may result in the establishment of a temporary government for West Germany. We previously stated at the convening of the Western powers' foreign ministers' meeting: "If the Four Powers Foreign Ministers' Conference cannot reach an agreement on the German and Austrian questions, the Iron Curtain of Eastern Europe will be lowered and become a new Great Wall, and the so-called two worlds will be more clearly manifested." Before returning home, they will confer with British and French representatives on how to take joint action to deal with the situation thereafter. If the current state of affairs continues to develop like this, the future is indeed worrying.

However, what deserves our attention even more is not the breakdown of the Foreign Ministers' Conference but the developments within the Soviet Union and the United States themselves. On the eve of the breakdown of the Foreign Ministers' Conference, the Soviet Union suddenly reformed its currency system. Currency reform itself does not necessarily have any extraneous meaning, but the timing of this Soviet currency reform and its inherent implications seem difficult to consider a normal reform. Reports from overseas have pointed out that this Soviet currency reform is aimed at establishing a ruble bloc to compete with the pound sterling area and the dollar bloc, and to facilitate competition with the Marshall Plan. At the same time, the special session of Congress convened by U.S. President Truman also passed a temporary emergency aid bill for China of $597 million. Although several specific issues regarding this temporary emergency bill have not been resolved, due to the failure of the Foreign Ministers' Conference, the Congress, which will reconvene after the Christmas holidays, will strengthen and expedite its completion.

As the signs of division in the world become increasingly apparent, we, as an Eastern country, naturally feel particularly concerned about the subsequent changes in the world situation. What we must first point out here is that this is not a division between East and West. Although we are an Eastern country, our cultural tradition has always emphasized the concept of "all under heaven are one family." We will never align ourselves with the so-called Eastern world simply because we are located in the East to oppose the West. What we demand is "all under heaven are one family"; if the world is truly divided, that would be truly regrettable. We hope that the politicians of the world will remember the lessons of history, refrain from hasty accusations, and renew old friendships. In that case, even if there are temporary signs of division, it will not be difficult to find ways to remedy and reunite. If this can be achieved, mankind can avoid future calamities, and we hope that politicians can demonstrate their magnanimity!

### Purpose of Controlling Yarn, Cotton, and Cloth

(Continued from page one) Cotton and cotton cloth are among the most essential daily necessities for the people of our country, second only to food and fuel in importance. Therefore, the government has had to take control measures to stabilize the price of cotton textiles. The implementation of control will inevitably affect private textile businesses, but for the sake of urgent public welfare, this measure is indeed reasonable.

Our country has a population of 460 million, and the demand for cotton and cotton cloth is extremely large. If each of us needs an average of half a catty of cotton to make a cotton garment, then the country needs 2.3 million dan of cotton each year. Our textile industry has a total of 4.5 million spindles, of which 3.6 million are in operation, requiring a total of 10.8 million dan of cotton each year. In addition, the handicraft weaving industry needs another 2.5 million dan. Therefore, the total annual demand for raw cotton in our country is more than 13 million dan.

Since the victory, the government has spent huge amounts of foreign exchange to purchase foreign cotton. In 1946, domestic cotton production was 7.43 million dan, and imported foreign cotton, including that purchased by UNRRA, totaled 6.8 million dan. In 1947, cotton production increased by 50% compared to the previous year, and it is expected to increase further next year, but it will still be difficult to achieve self-sufficiency.

The Shanghai Textile Industry Regulation Committee has been supplying cotton yarn to textile mills at official prices in order to stabilize the price of cotton textiles. Over the past two years, textile mills have made considerable profits, while the government has spent a lot of foreign exchange. However, due to the activities of speculators, the effort to stabilize cloth prices has not been effective.

After the implementation of emergency economic measures in February, speculation in gold and foreign currency was explicitly prohibited. Since July, the margin requirements for securities brokers on the Shanghai Stock Exchange have been increased, which has greatly reduced long positions in securities and stocks. Therefore, speculators in major cities such as Shanghai have focused on hoarding commodities. They use their large amounts of idle capital to speculate for profit, disrupting social stability, and cotton yarn and cloth often lead the rise in prices.

Based on this situation, the government has decided to restore the wartime control of cotton yarn and cloth in order to stabilize the price of cotton textiles and safeguard the welfare of the general public, so as to benefit the people's livelihood.

### Zhang Ji's Remains Placed in Coffin; To Be Buried at Hot Springs in Pingxi

Madam Zhang Arrives in Beijing Yesterday; Speaks of Premonition Amidst Grief

[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 17th dispatch] Ms. Cui Zhenhua, the wife of the late elder statesman Zhang Ji, accompanied by her niece and son-in-law, flew from Beiping to Beijing at 1:30 p.m. on the 17th and immediately went to the Zhang family hall at the Party History and Historical Materials Museum. When Madam Zhang saw Zhang's remains, she burst into tears. The reporter then visited Madam Zhang to express condolences. Amidst her grief, Madam Zhang recounted the premonition she had the previous night in Beiping, stating: She went to bed at nine o'clock that evening, but due to chronic insomnia, she was unable to sleep for a long time. She only heard the sounds of wind and rain and the very loud sounds of soldiers patrolling outside the door. Around eleven o'clock, she seemed to hear someone tapping on the window and throwing small brick fragments at the door. Madam Zhang did not pay attention to it, fearing that Beiping was not peaceful, and at the end of the year, when the weather was cold, petty thieves might visit. She then took a sleeping pill, but still could not fall asleep. Around one o'clock the next day, the knocking sound was repeated, but Madam Zhang still did not suspect anything. She then took another sleeping pill and did not fall asleep until three o'clock. Around four o'clock, she was awakened by someone, who said that there was a telegram from Nanjing. Madam Zhang immediately thought it was a telegram from Zhang, informing her of his travel dates, because Zhang had planned to return to Beiping within a few days. However, the telegram was the opposite of what she expected; it reported that Zhang was critically ill. After reading the telegram, Madam Zhang believed that it must be a serious illness and immediately instructed someone to notify the airline and friends to purchase tickets for the next day. However, due to the weather in Beiping, it was postponed until the 17th that she was able to arrive in Beijing. Madam Zhang also told reporters that when Zhang's mother gave birth to Zhang, it was a stormy night. However, after Zhang's birth, the wind and rain subsided. Zhang's mother once told people that Zhang would have a bad temper. Unexpectedly, Zhang's death also occurred on a night of rain and snow. He came in the wind and rain and left in the wind and rain, which is extremely saddening. Madam also stated: She herself has been suffering from insomnia. When Zhang returned late, he would often gently tap on her window, just like what she heard in Beiping. However, her husband would say whether it was a spirit or not, it seemed that Zhang still remembered her insomnia before his death.

### Deng Wenyi Reports on a Week of War Situation: Bandits Prepare for Spring Offensive, and Announces the Strength of Bandit Troops on Both Sides of the Pinghan Railway

[Report from our Nanjing Office on the 17th] Deng Wenyi, Director of the News Bureau of the Ministry of National Defense, reported on the war situation of the past week on the 17th, stating: "Judging from the situation of the past week, it can be seen that the communist bandits are preparing for a spring offensive in March next year. Because the weather is gradually getting colder, it is not suitable for military operations, but when spring comes, the communist bandits will definitely launch a large-scale offensive." In response to reporters' inquiries about the strength of the communist bandits on both sides of the Pinghan Railway, it was stated that Liu Bocheng's bandit troops have a total of six columns, about 78,000 people. The bandit army suffered more than 10,000 casualties in the Liulin battle, and now has less than 70,000 people, with more than 10,000 on the west side of the Pinghan Railway and more than 50,000 on the east side; Chen Yi's bandit troops have a total of about 80,000 people, with a total of 60,000 people in the triangle area of Lanfeng, Zhengzhou, and Xuchang, and more than 20,000 people north of the Longhai Railway; Chen Geng's troops have a total of more than 40,000 people, with 5,000 people in Liulin to support Liu Bocheng's bandit troops, and 10,000 people in Luohe. It is estimated that there are a total of 120,000 people east of Pinghan and south of the sea. Deng refused to announce the strength of the National Army in the area, but said that the strength of the National Army is strong, and the number should be between one and two times that of the communist bandits.

Deng reported on the week's battle situation from the 9th to the 16th of this month, stating:

Great Victory in the Dabie Mountains

The National Army advancing into the Dabie Mountains has achieved a great strategic victory. The bandit leader Liu Bocheng drove more than 70,000 people from his 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 6th, 10th, and 12th columns, dreaming of establishing a so-called "Central Plains Field Army base" in the Dabie Mountains, preparing to invade south of the Yangtze River next year. They were surrounded and annihilated by the National Army. In just two or three days from the 7th to the 9th of this month, more than 10,000 people from Liu's 10th and 12th columns were annihilated at the western end of Liulin Station. This forced Liu Bocheng to try his best to break through, seeking to get his main force out of the encirclement of the Dabie Mountains; at the same time, he still used a part of his forces to circle around in the Dabie Mountains, reluctant to leave his newly built nest of the past three months. Since the 11th, Liu's 10th and 12th columns have crossed the Pinghan Railway twice, following the path of Li Xiannian last year, and突個to the west. Part of them were attacked by the National Army one after another, and then shrank back to the Daxindian and Jinlongshan area on the east side of the Pinghan Railway.

Liu's Dream Completely Shattered

Liu's bandits were unable to break out of the encirclement with their main force to the west, so they changed the direction of their escape. On the evening of the 14th, they fled northeast in two groups, passing near Baiquanyuan in Fubei, and between Zhaihe and Huangchuan. They have now fled to the vicinity of Baozikou and Dufu store, but they have been attacked by the National Army along the way, and another two or three thousand horses have been killed or injured. The 2nd Column, which fled to the vicinity of Gushi, originally wanted to use the tactic of "big eats small" to attack the small number of defending troops in Gushi, in an attempt to retaliate for the frustration of being driven out of the Dabie Mountains by the National Army. However, because of the "skillful application of the National Army's strategy and tactics, beyond the expectations of the bandit army; during the period when the westward-窜bandit army was being annihilated in a grand and fierce manner west of Liulin Station, there was an unexpected fresh force,追擊the 2nd Column of bandits from the尾後. After being pressured and severely damaged, the 2nd Column of bandits had no choice but to竄to Sanhejian in the north. In order to rescue the bandit army besieged in the Dabie Mountains area, they竄again from Sanhejian to Yangliudian west of Liu'an on the 11th, and were again surrounded and attacked by the National Army, with more than 500 people killed or injured, fleeing southeast in embarrassment. At present, the National Army is still encircling and suppressing them on all sides, and Liu's dream of establishing a base in the Dabie Mountains is about to be shattered.

The Bandits in Western Henan are Bluffing

As for Chen Geng's troops in Western Henan, after being attacked by the Henan Security Corps at Xixiakou last week, the news that Liu Bocheng's bandit troops were besieged in the Dabie Mountains made him panic. He hurriedly sent the 9th Column from Fangcheng, south of the Funiu Mountains, to the vicinity of Tongbai to meet the remnants of the 12th Column. Another group of more than 5,000 people, in order to rescue Liu's bandits from breaking through, pretended to be bluffing. It is estimated that on the 14th, they passed through Minggang and Zhen from Fangcheng to the vicinity of Luohe on the Pinghan Railway.

The National Army in Eastern Henan Attacks the Bandits on Three Sides

Chen Yi's bandit troops in eastern Henan saw that the bandit's new base in the Dabie Mountains was being encircled and annihilated, and wanted to implement "besiege Wei to rescue Zhao". They gathered the 8th Column from western Shandong and竄south across the Longhai Railway on the 9th, combining the forces of five columns including the 1st, 3rd, 4th, and 6th, totaling 80,000 people, and advanced and retreated in the Chenliu, Weishi, Huyong, Changge, and Fugou areas, attempting to攻打Kaifeng and Zhengzhou in an attempt to contain the National Army's forces and reduce the danger of Liu Bocheng being besieged. The National Army, aware of their treachery, is encircling and suppressing them on three sides, from east to west, from north to south, and from west to east.

The Northeast Bandit Army is Exhausted

In the northeast, the bandit army has recently made slight movements again. In mid-December, the bandit army's 7th Column竄from Tongliao to the mountainous area near Zhangwu Fakuking, and the bandit army's 8th Column under Li Yunchang also竄east from the Yebaishou Lingyuan area to the Ershijiazi Yangshan area west of Jinzhou, and destroyed a section of the Beining Railway west of Jinxi; however, in the extremely cold northeast, the bandit army's ambition is greater than its ability, and this kind of action is only to make up for the failure of the bandit's so-called "general counter-offensive."

### The Question of the Merger of the Three Western Occupation Zones of Germany will be Negotiated in Washington Next Spring; Marshall Leaves London this Morning to Return Home

[Report from our agency] New York, 17th Broadcast: Washington News, the State Department announced that Marshall will broadcast to the nation at 10 pm on Friday about the breakdown of the Four Foreign Ministers Conference. Mr. Marshall is scheduled to return home on Friday morning.

[Report from our agency] London, 17th Broadcast: It is learned that the United States, Britain, and France may hold a meeting in Washington soon to discuss the merger of the western occupation zones of Germany. Bidault has apparently expressed his agreement to this meeting. This morning, British Foreign Secretary Bevin met with Bidault, mainly to discuss the German issue. At noon, Marshall went to Buckingham Palace to dine with the King and Queen of England. 、

[Reuters, London, 17th] It is learned that the United States and France have temporarily agreed that the foreign ministers of the United States, Britain, and France will hold a meeting in Washington on January 15th next year to discuss the organization of West Germany, but they still hope to cooperate with the Soviet Union. According to French sources, US Secretary of State Marshall had preliminary contact with French Foreign Minister Bidault last night, and the result was satisfactory. Marshall and Bidault also agreed to talk with British Foreign Secretary Bevin before leaving for home. Bidault is scheduled to return to Paris tonight. Since the London Foreign Ministers Conference has broken down, the parties concerned are now intensifying their focus on the subsequent issues, on the one hand, planning to integrate West Germany into the Marshall Plan, and on the other hand, still hoping that the Soviet Union will participate, but this will depend on the Soviet Union's ability.

[Associated Press, London, 17th] According to officials of this mission, the merger of the three western occupation zones of Germany by the United States, Britain, and France has not yet been completed quickly. The Western countries still need to have "long-term and difficult discussions" on the issue of economic or political unification of West Germany. However, informal negotiations on this issue have already begun, and formal negotiations are expected to begin early next year. American people who are most familiar with the situation in Germany are not very optimistic about the early establishment of the "three-zone" Germany. They are quite concerned about the difficulties that French public opinion has given to the French government. In fact, some American officials who implement American policy in Germany all advocate the merger with the French occupation zone, at least until after next spring. They pointed out that the participation of France in the merger of the British and American occupation zones, in addition to showing the strong unity of the West, has no other immediate benefits. Because France fears the threat of a powerful new Germany to its security, France's participation in the merger may instead delay the economic progress that helps the Marshall Plan.

[Reuters, London, 17th] According to well-informed sources, Marshall outlined to Bidault last night the US outline for the occupation zone merger plan, with France participating in the management of the Ruhr area, but on the basis of majority voting, and not exercising veto power. As for France's request to set up another government in the Rhine River basin, the US side believes that this is not necessary during the period when there is a military government in Germany, and should be put aside for future discussion.

### The British Government will Re-examine its German Policy; Bevin Severely Criticizes the Soviet Union for Seizing Materials in German Territory

[Reuters, London, 17th] Government officials said today that the British Cabinet may consider a comprehensive foreign policy tomorrow. At that time, Foreign Secretary Bevin will report on the failure of the Foreign Ministers Conference, and then begin to discuss the direction that Britain should take in the future. The result of the breakdown of the Foreign Ministers Conference has caused serious concern among officials. Britain will join the United States in urging France to participate in the merger of the occupied territories in Germany, and strive to improve German industrial production and work for European reconstruction.

[Reuters, London, 16th] British Foreign Secretary Bevin issued a statement after the failure of the Foreign Ministers Conference, accusing the Soviet Union of dismantling all German railway lines, public utilities, and factories, and placing them under military management to rule the economic life of Germany. Unless the Soviet Union makes these facts public, it cannot seriously discuss the issue of compensation. Bevin estimated that 70 percent of the production in the Soviet-occupied zone of Germany was either shipped to the Soviet Union in disregard of the Potsdam Agreement, or consumed by Soviet troops stationed there.

Bevin also stated that all exports from the British and American zones of Germany, including coal and wood, were converted at world market prices, and the foreign exchange obtained was used to import raw materials and other necessities, so that the German industrial economy could operate. Therefore, Molotov's claim that Britain and the United States were making huge profits from German exports was completely unfounded. Bevin also said that the authorities in the British and American zones were willing to dismantle and ship the factories listed in the recently announced compensation plan as quickly as possible. The Soviet delegation had never been able to point out which article of the Potsdam Agreement they were based on in demanding compensation in the form of German production. Bevin's statement has been distributed to the US, French, and Soviet delegations.

[Associated Press, Berlin, 16th] The US-British Joint Military Government recently announced that 22 German war equipment factories, originally scheduled to be dismantled as compensation, will be fully retained at the request of the Germans.

### The Soviet Union Shows Concessions on the Issue of German Assets in Austria; Representatives of the Four Foreign Ministers Meet to Discuss

[Reuters, London, 17th] Representatives of the Four Foreign Ministers are scheduled to meet in London today to discuss the Soviet Union's new concessions on the issue of German assets in Austria. The concession was announced by the Soviet representative shortly before the adjournment of the current Foreign Ministers Conference. The content is to reduce the Soviet Union's previous request to obtain 90 percent of Austria's eastern oil rights to two-thirds. However, the compromise proposal put forward by France only suggested giving one-third of the oil rights to the Soviet Union. The names of the representatives of the four foreign ministers are as follows: Marjorie Minck of the United Kingdom, Léan of France, Dujay of the United States, and Kotimov of the Soviet Union.

### The United States Bears Three-Quarters of the Expenses of the British and American Zones in Germany

[Reuters, Washington, 16th] Officials announced that the United States and Britain have temporarily agreed that the United States will bear 75 percent of the expenses of the British and American occupation zones, and Britain will grant the United States the power to manage German financial and trade institutions as compensation.

### West Germany's Capital Planned to be Located in Frankfurt

General Clay Made This Plan

[Central News Agency, New York, 16th] Gropius, Director of the Department of Architecture at Harvard University, revealed today that as early as four months before the London Conference of Foreign Ministers announced its breakdown yesterday, General Clay, the US Governor of Germany, advocated drafting a plan to make Frankfurt the capital of West Germany, which is formed by the three occupation zones of Britain, the United States, and France. Clay's was based on the assumption that the Four Foreign Ministers Conference would fail.

### Germans in the Soviet Occupation Zone Protest Attempts to Divide Germany

[Report from our agency] London, 17th Broadcast: Berlin News, the Communist Party of Eastern Germany today issued a telegram to political figures in the four occupation zones, protesting against the plan to merge the economies of Western Germany, and opposing any attempt to divide Germany. German political figures in the British and American occupation zones of Germany announced the formation of a draft for Western Germany to compete with the communist forces in the Soviet occupation zone of Germany. The Soviet official newspaper in Germany believes that the merger of the British and American occupation zones has an imperialist nature.

### The Soviet Union's New Ambassador to the United States, Pan Youxin, Arrives in Washington

[Central News Agency, Washington, 16th] The Soviet Union's newly appointed ambassador to the United States, Pan Youxin, arrived here last night from Yingsko. According to reports, Pan was the former Soviet ambassador to China.

### The United States Forms a Customs Union with Britain, France, Belgium, etc.; the United States will Reduce Import Taxes Starting Next Year

[Reuters, Washington, 17th] President Truman today ordered that, starting on January 1 next year, import tax rates will be reduced in accordance with the Geneva International Trade Agreement, but only on the condition that the countries concerned reduce taxes at the same time. The countries that have signed this trade agreement with the United States include Australia, Canada, Britain, France, and the Belgium-Netherlands-Luxembourg Customs Union.

### Attempting to Disrupt the Marshall Plan, the Soviet Union will Launch an Offensive, Expected to Target France Primarily

[Reuters, Paris, 16th] Well-informed sources in France believe that after the breakdown of the Foreign Ministers Conference, the Soviet Union will launch an offensive against the Marshall Plan, and will primarily target France. It is worth noting that the French Communist Party is now launching propaganda in rural areas to undermine Finance Minister Mey Chan's reconstruction plan.

The main points of these plans include increasing taxes on farmers and increasing tariffs in order to suppress agricultural product prices. Moscow's making Eastern European countries sacrifice their pre-war trade relations with the West and establishing a close offensive with the Soviet economy is part of its anti-Marshall Plan policy. The authorities especially pay attention to the recent trade agreement signed between the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia, which makes Czechoslovakia's steel industry closely match the Soviet Union's needs in the next five years. Well-informed sources also said that the Soviet Union is determined to adapt to the needs of the Soviet Union, and not the general industrial capacity of Czechoslovakia itself, which will be affected as a result. For example, the Soviet Union requires Czechoslovakia to supply 150,000 tons of steel pipes for the Soviet oil industry. A natural rise in prices and competition between government price suppression measures will take place in France in the coming months. The reasons for the natural rise in prices include the natural lack of winter and the loss of coal due to labor unrest. The French Communist Party's plan to disrupt the Marshall Plan is also expected to be intensified in these months.

### Italy Obtains a Share of the Gold Plundered by Germany During the War; the Four Powers Allow Italy to Demolish Submarines for Scrap Iron

### Japan's Attitude is Becoming Increasingly Arrogant; Rumors that it will Propose to the Peace Conference to Revoke Administrative Control and Retain Various Islands such as Ryukyu and the Kuril Islands

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 17th] This question of the Japanese newspaper Jiji Shinpo and Asahi Shimbun, etc., on the 11th of this month, all published a piece of news in an important position in the American World Weekly, publishing a secret Japanese document. It is said that the content is the proposal that Japan intends to submit to the United Nations Peace Conference on Japan, but the weekly did not name who or what agency drafted it, only saying that the Japanese side hopes to submit it to the Peace Conference on Japan when the opportunity arises. It is said that its main points are as follows: After the signing of the Peace Treaty with Japan, the United Nations' management of Japan should be limited to the minimum. It is necessary to avoid implementing the Peace Treaty with Japan by institutions like the current United Nations control of Japanese institutions. The United Nations' management agency for Japan should only consist of the ambassadors of the United States, Britain, China, France, and the Soviet Union. The above-mentioned United Nations ambassadorial delegation should be given the authority to directly interfere in Japanese administration. After a certain period, after the above-mentioned management agency is revoked, if disputes related to the implementation of the Peace Treaty with Japan occur, they should be subject to the decision of the International Court of Justice. Currently, except for military industries, all production should not be restricted. We should try our best to limit the dismantling of production plants due to compensation. Japanese merchant ships should be allowed to expand to 4 million tons. Japan is proud to have no objection to giving up the privileges and extraterritorial rights enjoyed in China before the war, as well as the mandate of the Caroline, Mariana, Marshall, and Palau Islands, but should strive to preserve the Kuril Islands. Xiao　原, Ryukyu, and other Pacific islands and small islands near the Japanese mainland (or even including Sulfur Island) Jiji Shinpo also commented on this matter in an editorial on the same day. Finally, it hopes that the contradictions between the major powers can be resolved as soon as possible, and should not make the Peace Treaty with Japan fall into the same fate as the Peace Treaty with Germany and Austria.

### France Tries to Recover from the Crisis (Part Two)

— Our Paris Correspondent, Yi Ruo

[Our Paris Dispatch] The air of November 19th was especially stifling and oppressive in France, with the striking masses becoming even more clamorous.

That evening, after the President of France accepted Ramadier's resignation, he immediately authorized Léon Blum, the leader of the Socialist Party, to form a cabinet. Fortunately, Blum had already begun a week of consultations, exchanging opinions for a week, and believed that with one final push, he could secure the nine votes needed from the Third Force coalition to form a government with ample support. After thirty-six hours of effort, yesterday (the 21st) afternoon, Blum entered the National Assembly hall, and under the chairmanship of Herriot, announced his policy platform to the 601 members of parliament. From the outset, he expressed his dual opposition to communism and de Gaulle, making any votes from those factions hopeless. He then discussed his economic policies, which he considered "correct," but which were so vague and elusive that they aroused suspicion among the Radical Socialist parliamentarians. He then addressed the issue of overseas territories, but his consistent advocacy for reconciliation with Annam could not please the right-wing minority, undoubtedly losing him a portion of the vote. He requested a vote of confidence from the parliament for his cabinet formation, and the results were revealed late at 11 p.m. A total of 277 voted against him, with 24 abstentions, and only 300 votes in favor—exactly the same number of votes of confidence that Ramadier had received in his last vote. Ramadier managed to linger for some time with that support, but Blum failed to achieve success. According to the constitution, "a vote of confidence for cabinet formation must receive an absolute majority of the parliamentary seats (including those absent), i.e., 309 votes. Once in power, an absolute majority of opposition is required for removal." Therefore, Ramadier could continue to hold on with those 300 votes, but Blum could not come to power with them. Newspapers in Britain, the United States, Russia, and Italy were unaware of the situation, panicking and making a fuss.

From that moment on, Blum lost his personal authority, and the Socialist Party lost its central role in the government. The Secretary-General of the Socialist Party, Mollet, walked out of the parliament hall dejectedly, saying: "Everyone put in a lot of effort. Blum still failed. Blum himself messed it up, so who can be blamed?" General public opinion believed that the Radical Socialists' dissatisfaction with other economic policies was a major fatal blow, otherwise there would not have been so many as 24 abstentions. The missing nine votes could certainly have been found in that area. The parliamentary spokesman for the Popular Republican Movement (MRP), Lecourt, felt that the Socialist leader could not distinguish between urgent and non-urgent matters, and his methods were not smooth.

Blum failed, and he reported to the President that night. The Third Force coalition also died with his failure.

IV.

President Auriol woke up this morning, considering that Blum's failure was due to the abstentions of the Radical Socialist parliamentarians. Why not ask a Radical Socialist member to try? At 10:00 a.m., he first invited the party's Minister of Justice to assume the premiership, but he declined. At 10:15 a.m., he also invited the party's Minister without Portfolio to take the job, but he also declined, both citing poor health as excuses, but in reality, they were worried that the Socialists might retaliate, making the effort futile. It was not until 11:15 a.m. that they found the MRP's Minister of Finance, Schuman, who was willing to give it a try. He immediately began contacting various parties, and by 6:00 p.m., everything was settled. It only took him seven hours, less than one-fifth of the time Blum had taken. Schuman went to the National Assembly and announced his policy platform to the assembly.

In the hall, only the Communist Party spokesman rose to argue, believing that his policies were not thorough enough, especially since he had served as a deputy minister in the Pétain government that surrendered to the enemy (from June to July 1940). As Minister of Finance in the Ramadier cabinet, he focused on exploiting the common people, and he would inevitably continue down Ramadier's old path, so they would definitely not vote for confidence. The Socialist Party thought that the MRP had helped the Socialist Party leader a great deal last night, so now that the MRP's Schuman was taking the stage, they would naturally reciprocate the courtesy, without saying much, and give him a vote of confidence. The MRP was Schuman's own party, so that goes without saying. The other parties felt that Schuman had been clean and fair in his conduct during his tenure, so there was no need to speak, and they gave him a vote of confidence. As for de Gaulle's faction of more than 70 seats, since Schuman had not been as straightforward as Blum in attacking the right wing, and he was about to be invited into the cabinet, they did not oppose him much.

At 9:00 p.m., the vote was revealed. Schuman received 412 votes of confidence, 112 more than Blum, and 103 more than the absolute majority required by the constitution (309 votes)! Only the Communist Party's 184 votes were against confidence, but that did not matter much. Schuman immediately began planning the selection of cabinet members, first consulting with the responsible personnel of his own party. At 10:15 p.m., he met with representatives of the Socialist Party, and at 11:00 p.m., he met with representatives of the Radical Socialist Party. By 1:00 a.m., the new cabinet members had not yet been decided.

According to general observation, whether Schuman can form a stable cabinet is highly questionable, because the MRP was the party that suffered the most disastrous defeat in the October election. This time, they were fortunate to have the Socialists yield the way and be in a position where the two major forces on the left and right were incompatible, so that Schuman could be entrusted with the important task. The constitution clearly stipulates that there cannot be two successive cabinet crises within the first 18 months of each National Assembly, otherwise the parliament will be dissolved, and the government will be temporarily managed by the Speaker along with representatives of each party. The intention is to eliminate the abuses of frequent cabinet crises that occurred in the Third Republic era. The current National Assembly has not yet reached a year. If Schuman cannot maintain his position until next June, then the parliament will be dissolved and a new election will be held. This is what de Gaulle has been constantly hoping for, and the Third Force's foundation will be further divided by the left and right factions. The French right-wing public opinion is already concerned about this. Moreover, if there is no one in the government, Speaker Herriot will temporarily serve as prime minister. Herriot himself is extremely opposed to personal dictators, and he is over 70 years old. Once he is no longer able to continue, he will be replaced by the Vice Speaker, the Communist Party's Duclos, which is even more feared by the right wing. Therefore, Schuman's own political skills may not be as good as Ramadier's, but due to the prevailing circumstances, his new cabinet has a reason to be realized.

V.

At this moment, the labor unrest is surging, and there is an unstoppable trend, and society is showing instability. On the morning when Ramadier had not yet resigned (the 19th), there were 300,000 people on strike in northern France and Paris-Marseille. The next day, there were 5 million people, and the third day, there were 7 million people. The importance of this can be imagined. The scope of the strike has expanded from Paris to all parts of the country, which is much more dangerous than the chain strikes in May and June. Six of the seven railway stations in Paris went on strike one after another starting yesterday morning, virtually isolating the city from the outside world. The ironworkers in the suburbs of Paris are completely on strike. The coal mines in northern France can produce 100,000 tons of coal per day, but now they cannot even mine 6,000 tons. Iron mines have also been drawn into the vortex. Elementary school teachers in the Seine province and Paris are all working slowly. Five major ports in France—Marseille, Rouen, Bordeaux, Nantes, and Le Havre—the first four have completely gone on strike, and the last one will take the same action next Monday. The French local authorities have tried to use the army to replace them, but this has been rejected by the Marseille navy. The British and American navies docked in the harbor are also taking a sympathetic attitude. The American Empire State has sent a telegram to the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) to express its opposition to breaking strike discipline. In addition, some of the female tailors in Paris are also on strike. Bricklayers across the country are scheduled to strike next Monday. Civil servants are also preparing to take action. Post office drivers and workers have decided to strike (there may be major changes by the time this article arrives). There are still countless others who are ready to move. The main reason is that the price of goods and wages are too disparate.

Starting next week, the fares for the two major means of transportation in Paris—the subway and the bus—will increase by 25% simultaneously.

As the former Minister of Finance, how Schuman will save the current situation in France, maintain the value of the franc, and adjust wages and prices will be the touchstone of how long his cabinet will last. If he can achieve this, although he is not the savior of France, he is the benefactor of millions of ordinary people (Paris, November 22).

### Grand Midnight Gala at the Great Light Theater: Competing to Purchase Charity Premiere Tickets to Benefit 300,000 Refugees; Enthusiastic Atmosphere among Chinese and Foreign Dignitaries under the Mercury Lights

[Our Newspaper] The honor tickets for the charity premiere of a Western film to raise funds for the Winter Relief Association were sold at the Great Light Theater last night. At the same time, previews of nine charity premiere Western films and the comedy "The Goddaughter" were screened. Many prominent figures and celebrities from the city were invited to attend.

At the beginning of the event, nine trailers were screened. After the trailers, the mayor took the stage to address the audience. He first expressed his gratitude to the guests for attending the event. Then, he cited the Bible, saying: "God blesses those who give, and also blesses those who receive. It is a blessing to receive, and it is also a blessing to give." He explained that there are 300,000 refugees in the city who need relief, 200,000 of whom come from all over, and 100,000 of whom are native to the city. For the sake of public security and our own safety, we should provide assistance to them. Otherwise, when they are starving and cold, they will inevitably take desperate risks. The mayor further stated: "Thanks to everyone's generous donations, all 1,400 tickets have now been sold out. Thank you very much." The mayor then thanked the foreign donors in English, and expressed his sincere gratitude to the nine Western film merchants, the nine cinemas that assisted with the charity premiere, and the companies and individuals who contributed in advertising, general affairs, reception, and other aspects. Then, the auction of the honor tickets began.

The honor tickets were auctioned by Xu Zhendong, the manager of the New China Bank, under the direction of Mr. Helmick, the former American judge in China. The two took the stage, each holding a small hammer for the auction. Mr. Xu first explained: "Because there is still a shortage of 4 billion in funds, we have decided to raise funds through auction. Each theater has two best seats, and we will auction these two seats as a group, and we hope everyone will actively bid."

The auction began, and the atmosphere was extremely enthusiastic. Whenever someone bid, the strong mercury light on the stage shone directly on them, instantly becoming the focus of attention for the entire venue. A total of five groups of ten honor tickets were auctioned in five rounds. The results were as follows: The first group was jointly purchased by nine film companies for 100 million yuan, and then transferred to the mayor and his wife. The second group was won by Yao Naizhi, the manager of the China Cement Company, also for 100 million yuan. The third group was purchased by Rong Hongyuan of the Shenxin Textile Company for 110 million yuan. The fourth group was purchased by George Hatem for 130 million yuan. The fifth group was purchased by the Guo Li'an brothers of the Wing On Company, also for 130 million yuan. After the auction, the comedy film "The Goddaughter" was screened. The event did not end until midnight.

### Mayor Convenes Grain Merchants for Discussions; Assistance Promised for Transport Difficulties

[Report from Our Newspaper] Due to the rising price of rice transported from Japan, which has been stirring up public sentiment, Mayor Wu convened a meeting with rice merchants yesterday at 10:00 AM. Representatives attending from the South Market included Yin Fuxiang, Hu Wen'an, Hu Xiangang, and from the North Market, Xu Songren, Cha Baosan, Cai Shengming, Gu Yisheng, totaling seven individuals. Ji Mingzhai, the head of the Food Section of the Social Affairs Bureau, was also present. Mayor Wu inquired in detail about the conditions at the source of production, expressing his hope that the market would not experience fluctuations, so as not to agitate the public and affect other commodity prices. He assured the merchants that if they encountered any difficulties, the government would do its utmost to assist in resolving them as quickly as possible. The representatives then explained the reasons for the decrease in supply and the high prices at the production areas, believing that the high prices in the producing regions and the difficulties in transportation made it impossible for rice merchants to maintain their costs. They suggested that the fundamental solution was to find ways to suppress prices in the producing areas and facilitate the flow of supplies. Mayor Wu then stated that he had already consulted with Minister Yu of the Ministry of Transportation and Director Chen of the two railway bureaus, and that at least 1,000 tons of grain would be transported to Shanghai daily via the Beijing-Shanghai Railway. This has already begun. In addition, the city government is also in contact with the National Association of Shipping Companies and the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to prioritize the transport of grain by waterways.

### Mistress's Heart Changes, Methods Cruel: Paramour Savagely Beaten and Seriously Injured

[Report from Our Newspaper] Wang Yuting began cohabiting with the young woman Mu Huiqin in November of the 34th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1945]. Wang even purchased a house for Mu on Liyuan Road in the South City, which Mu rented out as pocket money. In August of this year [1948], Mu became involved with a man named Wu Zhenjiang. She absconded with valuables from the house and cohabited with Wu at No. 1 Lujia Street on Xujiahui Road. When Wang discovered this, he went to the address and apprehended both Wu and Mu, sending them to the police station for processing. However, the police station declined to handle the case, as the two were not legally married, and advised them to settle the matter privately. Not only were Wu and Mu unwilling to reconcile, but they also claimed that the house on Liyuan Road in the South City belonged to Mu. They bribed gangsters to vandalize the property on the fourth of this month and severely beat Wang, causing permanent injuries. After investigating the case, the Lujiawan Police Station transferred it to the District Procuratorate for investigation. The victim, Wang Yuting, has also submitted a petition to the District Procuratorate requesting that the matter be handled according to the law.

### Heated Debate at Labor-Management Arbitration Board: Temporary Employee Hiring Procedures Determined

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Shanghai Labor-Management Arbitration Board held its 15th meeting at the Social Affairs Bureau yesterday afternoon. The main topic of discussion was the proposal for restricting the employment of temporary workers in various factories. Attendance and observers were numerous, and some workers even waited outside the venue to hear the results of the discussion. Wu Kaixian presided over the meeting.

First Use of Voting Method

During the discussion, representatives from the Industrial Association, the City Chamber of Commerce, and the General Labor Union held differing views on the proposal for restricting the employment of temporary workers, leading to intense debate. Subsequently, a vote was taken, and the proposal for restricting the employment of temporary workers in various factories was amended and passed by a vote of six to five. This was the first time that a vote had been used to decide a proposal since the establishment of the Labor-Management Arbitration Board. The content of the passed proposal is as follows: Factories employing temporary workers should not exceed 10% of the total number of workers in the factory, in accordance with the regulations stipulated in Order No. 118472, General Affairs Section 2, issued by the Ministry of Social Affairs on January 10, 1946. If the work of a temporary worker is indeed temporary and there is no need for continued employment, the worker may be dismissed upon the expiration of the work contract. If the work of a temporary worker is not temporary and there is a possibility or necessity for continued employment, the worker should be converted into a regular employee after working for three months. According to item 3, after a temporary worker is converted into a regular employee, if the employer must partially dismiss workers due to a business downturn and reduced workload, workers with shorter seniority and poorer skills should be dismissed first. If there is a labor-management dispute, it should be reported to the competent authority for verification.

### Index Discount for Letterpress Printing Industry: Resolution of Dispute Determined

During yesterday's meeting, the dispute between labor and management in the city's letterpress printing industry over the cost-of-living index discount was also discussed. The resolution was determined as follows: If the cost-of-living allowance for workers' families in various companies and factories is fully paid at 13.5 yuan, it will be calculated based on a 90% discount of the cost-of-living index announced by the city government. If various companies and factories do not have a cost-of-living allowance for workers' families, it will be calculated based on a 95% discount of the cost-of-living index announced by the city government. Furthermore, if various companies and factories have a cost-of-living allowance for workers' families, but the amount is less than 13.5 yuan, it may be calculated proportionally using this discount method (from 90% to 95%). The aforementioned discount shall be from November 1, 1947, to December 31, 1947. From January 1, 1948, in addition to complying with government-stipulated discounts, no further discounts will be given for the cost-of-living index. Regarding the above three items, if various companies and factories are indeed unable to bear the cost due to a business downturn, labor and management may negotiate and determine a discount method separately. The remaining matters shall be handled in accordance with the regulations stipulated in Order No. 218, City Evaluation Secretary (36), issued by this committee on July 12, 1947.

### Ensuring Security on Both Railways: Winter Defense Implemented Along the Lines

### Zhou Xiangyun's Estate Causes Dispute Over School Establishment

[Report from Our Newspaper] Estate disputes are commonplace in Shanghai, mostly arising from conflicts of interest among heirs. However, a recent estate dispute concerns the establishment of a university, differing from ordinary cases.

The late Ningbo merchant Zhou Xiangyun was a major real estate magnate in Shanghai, leaving behind a substantial estate. Zhou's first wife passed away long ago, leaving a son and two daughters. The second wife bore one daughter, so the family included a wife, a son, and three daughters. The dispute arose between Wang Fengnian, the husband of the second daughter from the first marriage, and the rest of the family, lasting four years.

Wang Fengnian is a dedicated philanthropist who contributes to education. His ancestor Wang Yinting was also a wealthy merchant. Wang's inheritance was largely used for educational purposes, reportedly exceeding 2.5 billion yuan. In the spring of 1938, he founded Sanwu University in Shanghai. It closed on December 8, 1941, due to the entry of enemy troops into the concession, but his commitment to education remained unwavering.

Estate Dispute Remains Unresolved

In 1943, Zhou Xiangyun fell ill and passed away without a will. Before his death, he entrusted lawyer Gao Junxiang to draft a "Property Gift Deed," gathering Zhou's relatives and friends to sign it. About 80% of the property was to be given to Zhou's wife, son, and daughters-in-law. As Zhou Xiangyun was on his deathbed, his wife held his hand to sign the character "Zhou," but he could not continue. She then used his seal to replace the signature. Subsequently, she, the son, and daughters-in-law signed, but the three daughters did not. Wang Fengnian, as the son-in-law of the second daughter, objected, arguing that the "Property Gift Deed" should be made when the donor is healthy. At this time, Zhou Xiangyun was unconscious, so he accused lawyer Gao of "forgery" and obtained Gao's handwritten draft to bring legal action. However, it was resolved through mediation by lawyer Shan Yuhua. Zhou Xiangyun passed away that afternoon, and the distribution of the estate remained unresolved.

Xiangyun University Cannot Open

Afterwards, Wang Fengnian wrote a letter to Zhou's family, proposing that one-third of the estate be used to establish Xiangyun University. This letter was published in several major newspapers in the city, garnering public sympathy, but Zhou's family ignored it. At that time, under enemy rule, Wang could not act hastily.

After the victory, Wang proposed an early discussion, and the estate's heirs asked Wang Boyuan, the general manager of Kenye Bank, to mediate. The agreement divided the estate into seven shares, with one share, real estate located on Niuzhuang Road and Zhongzheng Middle Road, valued at over 500 gold bars, to be used for public welfare, namely the establishment of Xiangyun University. However, the land deeds remain in the hands of Zhou's family, and Xiangyun University, for which preparations have been underway for four years, cannot be built or opened.

Final Scene Awaits Development

Last month, Wang first sent a letter urging delivery and then announced in the newspaper, in the name of the Xiangyun University Preparatory Office, the reservation of the right to dispose of the two properties. Zhou's family also hired lawyers such as Gao Junxiang to respond, saying that although the property has been designated for public welfare, the specific use should be discussed after it is sold.

Former colleagues of Sanwu University, Xu Chongqin and Shan Yuhua, also jointly wrote to Zhou's descendants at the end of last month, stating: "...If you commemorate your ancestor and support this righteous cause, you will benefit the people and students immensely. If you unfortunately listen to slander and violate the previous agreement, we will submit proposals to the council and resort to law. One call to action will gather supporters, and we will support Wang until the goal is achieved."

Will Zhou's family hand over this share of the estate, and will Xiangyun University be established? We will await further developments!

### Registration of Various Vessels

(B) The management methods for rowing boats in the Huangpu River and Suzhou Creek are determined as follows: The Public Utilities Bureau and the Police Department will jointly announce that all vessels under the jurisdiction of this city must apply for registration at the various vessel registration offices of the Public Utilities Bureau within two months from the date when the license plates for the 37th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1948] are ready. Vessels that fail to register within the deadline will be dealt with according to the rules for dealing with illegal vessels. However, vessels arriving from other ports must apply for registration upon arrival. A comprehensive inspection of all vessels in the port will begin on April 1, 1948, organized by the Public Utilities Bureau with the assistance of officers from the Water Police Sub-Bureau.

### 40% Discount for Military and Police Personnel on Ships

(C) The preferential treatment measures for military personnel traveling by ship are passed as follows: Military and police personnel traveling by ship should present an official letter or travel pass from their military or police organization or unit, which will be certified by the (Shanghai City) Military and Police Personnel Ticket Purchasing Certification Office, jointly organized by the Port Command, Songhu Garrison Command, the Independent 3rd Battalion of the Military Police, the City Police Department, and the Shipping Business Association. They can then purchase tickets from various shipping companies at a 40% discount. The luggage and small items carried by military and police personnel that exceed the regulations for passenger luggage are still subject to freight charges.

### Puji Railway: Inaugural Through Train

[Dispatch from Our Newspaper, Jinan, December 12] The Jinpu Railway Bureau, in order to celebrate the first repaired and reopened section of the Puji Railway since the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, which is a vital artery connecting the north and south, invited over a hundred representatives from all walks of life and domestic and foreign journalists from Beijing and Shanghai to take the inaugural train from Pu to Jinan on the 10th for sightseeing. At the same time, another special train was prepared to invite representatives from all walks of life in Jinan to conduct an actual on-site inspection of the rail connection point on the line at the foot of Hongshi Mountain, 300 meters from the 384-kilometer mark between Tai'an and Zhangxia on the 11th, and to observe the road's restoration project.

That morning, I braved the cold winds of the north and stepped into the newly decorated No. 1314 special train, adorned with red and green decorations. The car was heated, making the temperature as warm as spring. The soft sofas were comfortable and pleasant, and the loudspeaker played melodious music, temporarily making me forget that the world outside was still freezing.

The train departed on time at 8:30 AM. Because it was the first trip, the driver was particularly cautious and careful. Slowly, it passed over Baimashan and Dawangzhuang. What appeared before me were the fortress-lined roadsides, densely packed sentry posts, sparsely populated but mostly dilapidated villages, and the villagers holding the most primitive weapons on the square: red-tasseled spears.

There was also a peasant on guard duty on the side of the road, also holding a red-tasseled spear. As the train passed, they struck a pose of attention in a pretentious manner.

At 10:15 AM, the train passed Gangshan to the rail connection point at the foot of Hongshi Mountain. The railway bureau had specially made two wooden signs here, which read "Rail Connection Point" and the date. The train stopped here, and everyone got out of the car and took a group photo at the connection point. I also took a special photo with Director Song Huancheng of the Railway's Engineering Department, Squad Leader An Wenlan of the Repair Squad, and Section Chief Song Jianfang, who contributed the most to the road's repair. After I praised their achievements in an article last time (November 18th, Our Newspaper), the guests and colleagues on the train this time all unanimously praised them as "Repair Heroes."

The communists have what they call "Explosion Heroes," but I firmly believe that our "Repair Heroes" will surely be able to overcome the communists' "Explosion Heroes," and that the power of construction will ultimately be able to prevail over the power of destruction.

Last year, the Jiaoji Railway was also repaired by An's squad. This year, the Xuji section of the Jinpu Railway was also completed under their weathering the elements. When Squad Leader An reported in the car that more than 70 people from the repair squad had fallen into the water and drowned while repairing the Da Wen River Bridge, and that he had mobilized his staff to work day and night when Director Chen Shungeng ordered that he had to take a train from Jinan to Pu on the 30th for the first inspection along the way, many people worked hard, lost sleep and rest, and more than 20 people carried a steel rail together, running to the construction site, just like charging into battle on the battlefield. Finally, the rails were successfully connected at Hongshi Mountain at 11:00 PM.

Everyone couldn't help but feel emotional, and applause broke out enthusiastically!

At 10:30 AM, the train headed south, and arrived at Wande at 12:40 PM. In order to return to Jinan that evening, the train turned around at this point. At this time, I saw many old people who were transporting steel rails. During the chat, I learned that these steel rails used to be buried far away in the mud more than two or three miles away under the orders of the communists. This time, they were dug up and transported back after a heavy reward from the railway bureau. The price of this rail was 240,000 yuan (the price is set according to the distance of the road). A friend from the railway bureau told me: Before the war, anyone who stole or destroyed traffic was killed without exception. Now, under the communists' road-destruction policy, the government has to trade it back at a high price, and the military back-and-forth has turned into a people's "burying steel rails" and "selling steel rails," openly doing business with it!

At 1:00 PM, the train departed from Wande and returned to Jinan, arriving safely at 5:00 PM. After arriving at the station, news came that the communist bandits once ambushed four trains and 8,000 civilians east of Wande today, preparing to destroy the road. After the national army strengthened its forces in the area, they disintegrated and fled separately. Therefore, the knot hidden in everyone's heart is exactly what Commander Wang Yaowu said: "Repairing the road is important, but protecting the road is even more important."

### Jade Emperor Temple in Jiangyin Destroyed by Fire

[Dispatch from Our Newspaper, Jiangyin, December 16] Guanshan Township in the west of the county has Qinwang Mountain (commonly known as Xiaomaoshan), with the Three Mao Peaks on it. Every spring, the incense is very prosperous. There is a three-story Jade Emperor Temple on the mountain. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, it was once burned down by the enemy. After the victory, local people raised funds to rebuild it. On the afternoon of the 13th, three young villagers suddenly appeared with a foreign bottle in their hands and went up to the Jade Emperor Temple, only saying that they were playing. The monks in the temple did not suspect anything. The next morning (14th) at about 3:00 AM, the Jade Emperor Temple suddenly burst into flames. At that time, the wind was very strong, and in an instant, the second and third halls were set ablaze. Villagers from Qiaowan, Cha Qi, and other villages near the foot of the mountain went to rescue the fire, but because the mountain was high and the water was dry, they could not extinguish it. The rebuilt Jade Emperor Temple was once again reduced to ashes. Afterwards, the monks realized that it was caused by arson by bandits.

### Students of Zhapu Maritime School Search for Amusement at Night, Merchants and Residents Insulted, Emergency Meeting of All Sectors in the Town

[Our Newspaper, Pinghu, 15th] Since the National Advanced Maritime School moved to Zhapu this autumn and started recruiting students, the issue of school facilities has not yet been resolved as scheduled, so the official start of school is still pending. On the night of the 13th, around 7:00 PM, forty to fifty students from the school caused a major disturbance while buying stationery, which led to widespread anger in Zhapu. As of the time of writing, the matter has not yet been resolved. It is reported that around 7:00 PM on the night of the 13th, forty to fifty students from the school were wandering the streets in the dark and then went to the Datel Paper Shop outside the South Gate to buy stationery. Because they questioned the high prices, an argument broke out between the students and the shop assistants. The students then grabbed and beat the shop assistant, Ren Zichen. Shortly after, they went to the Oriental Printing House at the south end of the street and subjected the shop owner, Xu Xiqi, to insults and beatings. People gathered to watch, and despite repeated attempts to dissuade them, the students would not listen. This aroused public anger.

As the situation became chaotic and developments were pending, the students blew whistles to gather a crowd. Fortunately, Yang Pinsheng, the captain of the Zhapu security police, arrived with his team to suppress the situation. Just as they were about to investigate, a gunshot was heard, and the security police fired several shots into the air as a warning. Afterwards, the school authorities, Yang, an inspector from the Ministry of Education who happened to be in Zhapu, Director Jin, Valley, Huang, Secretary Yi, and others held discussions but could not find a solution. Furthermore, it was reported that one student, Sun Chuansheng, had gone missing from the school on the night of the 13th.

They resolved to: Expel the students involved in the incident; fully compensate for medical expenses; publish an apology in major Shanghai-Hangzhou newspapers; and guarantee that similar incidents will not occur again. However, some observers believe that there may be other factors behind the students' actions, and they are closely monitoring the situation.

### American Ambassador Summoned Capital Reporters Yesterday to Discuss Sino-American Education Issues, Elaborated on Key Points of Using Education Funds

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 17th] American Ambassador Stuart summoned reporters at 11:00 AM on the 17th to report on the implementation of the Fulbright Act in China and the situation of the first meeting of the Sino-American Education Fund. Ambassador Stuart pointed out that the purpose of Fulbright, who provided this act, and the American government, which implemented it, is to develop international understanding through cultural exchange between the United States and other relevant countries. The United States is taking all steps to implement this act, prioritizing China. Ambassador Stuart explained the principles for using the Sino-American Education Fund and elaborated on two key points: 1. Funding American scholars to come to China to pursue studies must be satisfactory to the Chinese requesting institutions and should be as close as possible to Chinese students, allowing Chinese and American students to share social lives and promote friendship between the two countries. 2. For Chinese students, the Foundation believes that those who have achieved excellent results in American-funded educational institutions should be assisted. Due to currency controls and the fact that the funds are all in Chinese legal tender, the Foundation is unable to send Chinese students or professors to the United States at this time. To the extent possible, the Foundation will encourage direct exchange of students and professors between Chinese and American universities. Finally, Ambassador Stuart announced that until the State Department appoints a formal officer, Embassy Second Secretary Mooreby will serve as the interim executive director of the Foundation.

It is scheduled to go to Hangzhou the day after tomorrow and transfer to Wuxi on the 21st, returning to the defense on the 24th. In the team's final game last night, it met the city champion Soviet team. Ziqi ultimately lost due to inferior skills. Hualian displayed superb basketball skills, resulting in a 68-53 victory for the Soviet team. In the first half, Hualian led by six points, 32-26. Despite the severe cold weather, the audience was still enthusiastic. The internal activity platform was completed, and the order was well maintained, still with the cooperation of the military police and the Siwei Tram Company.

Hualian relied entirely on experience and strategy under the command of Dali last night to win. Ziqi only relied on its superior physical strength and fast pace to attack. Due to the lack of variety, the defense could not resist Hualian's attack, resulting in a dead end. In the first half, Liao Dihang's long shots repeatedly hit the mark, scoring many points, causing Hualian to fall into a difficult battle. The score was 16-13 and 21-20, with Ziqi leading twice. Hualian changed its strategy and saw success. The team played better in the second half, leading by as much as 22 points, 62-40, at one point, and Ziqi's entire line collapsed. However, Ziqi's spirit of fighting to the end made the game tense for a long time, which was truly commendable.

Ziqi started with Liao Dihang, Yun Zhijun, Wang Shixuan, Zheng Daguang, and Cao Zhiji. Hualian Li Zhenzhong, Chen Xuechong, Wu Chengzhang, Bao Songyuan, and Liu Fushan scored the first record, each with five equal points. The battle was a tug-of-war, with four ties at 7, 9, 15, and 13. Shixuan and Dihang made one free throw and one hit, and the away team led by 16-13. Dali Fushan scored, and the score was tied again at 16. After that, Hualian had a smooth run, leading by 32-26 in the first half. Hualian played even better in the second half, scoring eighteen points in one go, thus establishing a victory at 50-34. Wang led 16-38, Ren Baicheng replaced Dali, and both sides scored. Finally, Wang Shixuan was fouled out, which was no longer relevant to the outcome of the game, resulting in a final score of 68-53.

### Gold Management Bureau Bans Money Exchange Businesses; All Must Close Immediately; Original Names and Signs of Silver Houses and Money Shops Must Be Removed

[Reported by this newspaper] Money exchange businesses in the city have mostly engaged in foreign currency exchange business. Since the government banned the buying and selling of gold and the circulation of foreign currency, the money exchange businesses have long lost their business targets. It has also been found that the industry mostly uses the names of silver houses and money shops, which is very confusing with the names of silver and money firms and shops approved by the Ministry of Finance. It is learned that the Shanghai Financial Management Bureau of the Ministry of Finance, in order to correct the public's perception and prevent malpractices, has specially limited the industry to stop all money exchange business from today. In addition, all original names of silver houses and money shops and their signs should be removed. The industry association should also cancel its registration to conform to the facts and eliminate abuses. If there is any delay in complying or any violation, the bureau will send the case to the court for strict handling according to law. It is heard that the above measures will be announced by the bureau and sent to the Shanghai Municipal Government for execution.

Another report: Yesterday, the reporter visited the person in charge of the Shanghai Gold Management Bureau to inquire about his opinion on the ban on money exchange businesses. According to him, money exchange businesses in the city began to be established during the concession period and mostly engaged in foreign currency exchange business. The establishment of the industry has not been approved by the Ministry of Finance, so people generally call them "underground banks." Since the government banned the buying and selling of gold and the circulation of foreign currency, the industry has long lost its business targets and there is no possibility of existence. In addition, it has recently been found that many of those who secretly buy and sell gold and banknotes are still members of the industry, which is a violation of government laws. The bureau consulted with the Shanghai Municipal Government and decided to notify Wang Zhengcheng, the chairman of the industry association, that from today, all businesses should be closed and the original signs should be removed to operate other legal businesses to stabilize the social financial order. The person in charge also said that there are a total of 195 money exchange businesses in the city, all of which will be closed from today.

Tight Credit, Weak Buying, Hua Stocks Gradually Decline

The state of flat and weak opening is difficult to improve. Yongsha opened at 447 yuan and 450 yuan, and rose to 451 yuan before falling. There was a proposal to raise the off-market interest rate to 3.45 and 3.9, and it was sold and retreated to 439 yuan and 440 yuan, and then rose to 443 yuan and 445 yuan. As there were many sellers, it retreated to 435 yuan and 439 yuan, and the off-market interest rate was opened at 3.15 and 3.6, and people's hearts were slightly settled. The off-market asking price was still several yuan higher than the number of deliveries in the market, and Lianhua Yongye hung up the daily limit, and Yongsha rose again to 443 yuan and 445 yuan. Then it fell to 429 yuan and 430 yuan, and closed at 430 yuan and 431 yuan.

Match fell slightly, Tongyi and Zhngsi were flat, Zhngfang and Datong rose slightly, Lianhua Water Industry and two real estate stocks rose to the limit, the delivery stock Xinguang fell slightly, Qinxing fell by 10%, and the rest fell by 5%.

The subsequent delivery will be suspended as usual. Although the night report has an order to suspend the business of national silver houses and money exchange shops, the stock market is optimistic, and there is a rumor that makes people feel better. Retail investors continue to absorb, and the difference between national banks has little impact. Yongsha rose to 448 yuan, and all parties sold it, and it fell back to about 435 yuan. After being absorbed, it rose again to 440 yuan at the close. After the close, it is inevitable to call low. As a result, compared with the last closing price, except for Yongye and Lianhua, the two real estate stocks still hit the daily limit, and Zhngfang rose by 10% after hitting the daily limit. Tongyi Business and Zhngfa each rose by 5%, Huafeng rose by 10%, Jinglun was still flat, and the rest rose slightly.

Securities firms, foreign firms, and money exchange businesses were all out, and only the Guang gang was taking in.

[Reported by this newspaper] There are still some technical issues that need to be resolved before the actual resumption of business between China and Japan. In addition to the exchange settlement procedures, there is also the issue of credit. In the past, when the China Trust Bureau handled barter trade, it owed millions of US dollars due to the small amount of exports from China, so the Allied Headquarters required that the accounts of future Sino-Japanese trade be guaranteed by the Chinese delegation to Japan. The delegation could not accept it due to its status, and everything is currently under negotiation.

A related person told the reporter: Some technical issues are currently being studied by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and will be submitted to the Executive Yuan for decision within days. Regarding the export of Taiwan sugar to Japan, it has not yet been finalized, but China does have a batch of sugar ready to be shipped east, and is currently negotiating prices with the other party. In the world, besides China, there is also Brazil that can supply sugar to Japan. In terms of price, Brazilian sugar prices are lower, and China is actually at a disadvantage, but Taiwan sugar has a stronger sweetness and is favored by the Japanese, which is not easy to change. Therefore, if production increases in the future, it will become a major export to Japan.

### Frequent Cutting Sales, Abundant Chips, Cotton Yarn and Cloth Fall Together; Current Cotton Market People are Afraid to Open

[Reported by this newspaper] Yesterday, the yarn market was opened by China Textile Construction as usual, and the allocation price remained unchanged. At the beginning, those in the industry who had tight credit were mostly cutting sales, and there was a shout of selling in the market, and the market fell. The 42-count Blue Phoenix fine yarn was no less than 46 million. Near the close, the realists took advantage of the low to search and absorb, and the price at the close returned to 46.2 million yuan, which was 2.2 million yuan lower than the previous day. The remaining branches of rented fine yarn also fell, from 350,000 to about 2 million yuan.

Another report: China Textile Construction Company sold a total of 1,038 pieces of Lianxiang cotton yarn yesterday as usual, including 503 pieces in various counties outside the city, which is equivalent to 1,440 pieces of 20-count yarn. A total of 218 applications were submitted by manufacturers.

In the cotton cloth market yesterday, due to the unprecedented tight credit in the morning, people were afraid, and cloth merchants kept cutting sales. Dyeing factories occasionally reduced their work, and many white坯cloth were sold. Unexpectedly, around 11 o'clock, big players from the West gang came again and cut their losses, but there was a lack of receivers, and the chips were abundant, and the asking price fell all the way.

In the afternoon, due to the sharp contraction of credit and the need to pay for the allocation of goods today, there was no shortage of price sellers, and the decline was seen again. Around 4 o'clock, the asking price was 8.5 million yuan, and finally it fell to 7 million yuan, but there was still a lack of buyers. The futures were within the 6 million yuan mark, similar to the allocation price.

Factory Silk

Yesterday, the market was still weak, and the asking prices for each grade were 1 million yuan lower than the previous day. The CD grade was asking for 90 million yuan, and the price of 85 million yuan for immediate payment had several deals, because it was necessary to get the money, so I had to endure the pain of cutting it off. Because the price of native silk in the countryside had not been reviewed, the market remained unchanged, but there were no transactions.

Silk Goods

The price of silk was covered and fell sharply yesterday. The opening price of Huaqiang goods fell to 4.5 million yuan with transactions, because the credit of the industry was very tight, and they shouted loudly, with the smallest falling to 4 million yuan.

### "The Soviet Education System"

— Yang Tongfang

Authored by Medinsky, translated by Zhang Jiming, First edition by Kaiming, April 1947

In the educational thought of the modern world, the Soviet Union and the United States represent two important trends, influencing the advancement of education in other countries. Especially the Soviet Union, in conjunction with its unique political and economic progress, has achieved remarkable success in both the quality and quantity of its cultural and educational endeavors. Our country is about to enter a new stage of democratic constitutionalism. We should look to others as examples in developing national education and promoting a culture of academic research. Although our political system differs greatly from that of the Soviet Union, we can still learn from their unwavering spirit in educational work and the strong conviction they hold for cultural and educational undertakings, which can serve as an encouragement to us.

Here, I would like to introduce to readers "The Soviet Education System" written by Soviet education doctorate, Eugene Nikolayevich Medynsky. Medinsky is a professor at the National Lenin Pedagogical Institute. He has demonstrated extremely outstanding achievements in educational research and has authored many works. From the Soviet education system, we can see how their cultural and educational endeavors strive for quantitative expansion and qualitative improvement under a planned system and supervision. In a certain sense, the education system is a reflection of educational thought. By examining the Soviet education system, we can easily grasp the main trends in their educational thought. This is because the system is not built out of thin air; it is based on the objective needs of society and far-reaching ideals.

This book is almost entirely a report on the current state of education, with little theoretical exploration. The language is concise and clear, and the statistical figures provide us with many recent data. The book is divided into thirteen chapters, covering everything from the goals and organization of education, the school system, facilities at all levels of schools, teacher training, adult education institutions, to educational research, forming a complete system.

The implementation of education in the Soviet Union takes into account the premise of enriching modern knowledge and culture as much as possible, and it also requires the development of independent thinking and creative working abilities. They believe that in order to enable everyone to consciously participate in political life, compulsory education must be implemented to eliminate illiteracy. At the same time, they are mindful of Tsarist Russia before the revolution, when a gulf separated intellectual and physical labor. Now, they have broken it down. In addition to fully developing intelligence and cultivating a progressive worldview, the Soviet education system also includes moral training. Of course, their moral foundation is based on socialist labor ethics. Therefore, the training in their schools and social education institutions focuses on correct labor practice and discipline, and a love and dedication to work. It starts with the teaching of practical skills, expands to an interest in technology and large-scale industrial and agricultural production, and then progresses to learning scientific production skills.

People generally believe that Soviet education is entirely dominated by utilitarian thinking and that the entire education system seems to be only for production, but this is not entirely true. On the other hand of enriching material life, Soviet educators also emphasize cultural cultivation. The construction and equipment of their schools pay attention to aesthetic conditions, and the promotion of art education is spared no effort. In recent years, the Soviet Union has devoted all its efforts to increasing the number of theaters, cinemas, conservatories, and art galleries, which shows their attention to cultural life and they promote and improve these places as much as possible, in coordination with the meaning of education. In order to develop children's aesthetic abilities, extracurricular and intramural activities especially emphasize the concept of educating and living artistically.

The emphasis on physical training is another feature of Soviet education. Physical training occupies an important position in both curricular and extracurricular activities. They regard the physical strength of the people as one of the important "assets" of national strength. All measures related to the health of women and children, as well as various childcare institutions for children under school age, have begun basic physical training. This also contains the meaning of labor and national defense preparation.

From the Soviet education system, we can also see these characteristics: all educational institutions are connected, from kindergarten to the highest level of schools, including adult education, all are consistent and connected; the national education system is jointly implemented by the Soviet state, people's organizations, and families; education is separated from the church and is not bound by religion; at all levels of schools and all educational institutions, men and women enjoy equal educational opportunities; the uniformity of schools, without any ethnic or class differences or restrictions, the curriculum is continuous from the lowest to the highest level; schools at all levels are open to all people, and elementary education is universal and compulsory; developing a culture with a national form and socialist content, and using the students' native language for teaching.

The book provides a clear description of Soviet teachers. In addition to their teaching work, their teachers also actively assume public affairs and national defense work. A strong sense of collectivism makes them brave in sharing various tasks for the country. In the recent German-Soviet War, it fully proved that Soviet teachers are loyal and brave sons and daughters of their motherland and people. They are indeed worthy of the title of "cultural fighters." The heroic and tragic deeds of several brave principals and teachers described in the book truly move us. Soviet teachers not only have rich scientific knowledge and teaching enthusiasm but also have a broad and correct outlook on life and the world. The country does its best to improve the material and spiritual treatment of teachers. There are special institutions to handle teacher welfare. Teachers are not only guaranteed their status, but they can also enjoy various national honors and rewards, such as titles and medals.

The development of adult education in the Soviet Union shows that their various facilities for social education have achieved significant results. The efforts to popularize adult education are almost as great as those to popularize elementary education. Adult secondary schools are established to meet special needs. Libraries and clubs with educational significance have achieved remarkable results in terms of quantity and content. The newly emerging "cultural rest parks" and museums and art galleries have made great contributions to adult education.

As for educational research work, the Soviet Union has now applied various scientific research methods to explore various issues in theory and teaching implementation. In addition to the National Lenin Scientific Education Research Institute, there are also the Public Education Planning and Organization Research Institute, the Technological Education Research Institute, the Central National Education Research Institute, the Children's Literature Research Institute, and the Curriculum and Teaching Methods Research Institute. Soviet educators have applied kindergartens to study the developmental characteristics of early childhood. The establishment of all education systems is based on the research results of experts. Soviet education scholars have written many works on the in-depth study of the history of education. A new style of educational literature has created a new style of educational writing. The Soviet Academy of Educational Sciences, established less than five years ago (the author of this book is also one of the staff members of the Academy), has created many brilliant results in principles, philosophy, psychology, and teaching methods. Today, I don’t know how many famous professors are immersed in research work.

Looking at the development of education in the Soviet Union, it is closely related to their political, economic, and social conditions. Inevitably, it is stained with narrow "nationalism," but their education has developed to specialization, scientification and lifelikeness. Because of specialization, they can focus on research work. Because of scientification, they can pay attention to equipment and the application of new tools and excellent teaching methods. Because of lifelikeness, education and the lives of the broad masses of people are linked. At least the Soviet education facilities are proceeding along a goal and a plan. From the system, it can be seen that their education has a unique "personality". Looking at others, we should think about ourselves, know what to take and what to be wary of, and at the same time, it is a very valuable inspiration and encouragement.

### Introduction to Electric Motors

— Mang

Authored by Huang Youxiong, published by Kaiming Bookstore

"Electric Motors" is divided into three parts: the first part is divided into nine chapters, the second part is divided into five chapters, and the third part is divided into seven chapters. The first part describes the principles and structure of electric motors, as well as the production of the simplest electric motor, from the simplest to the manufacture of various advanced electric motors. The last chapter of this part gives us a correct concept. We used to think that for an electric motor of the same size, if we use different voltages to make it rotate, then the force provided by the high voltage must be greater, and the force provided by the low voltage is naturally smaller. In fact, it is not as we imagined. For an electric motor of the same size, no matter how high or low the voltage supplied, the force it produces is the same. However, before reading this book, I did not know the real situation. Isn't this correcting our previous misconceptions?

The second part describes the principles of transformers and the production of various sizes of transformers. Because it is too uneconomical to use dry batteries or storage batteries to drive electric motors, we can only rely on the current from the electric light wires. However, the voltage of the electric light wires is very high and cannot be directly used. We must use a transformer to reduce the voltage before it can be used. Therefore, a transformer is an essential item in application. The third part talks about the application of electric motors. Here, it tells you the principle of trams, how to apply electric motors to vehicles, electric fans, etc. More interesting is the use of electric motors to make puppets dance. When you actually make and apply these interesting applications, you will be surprised and say: "How great is the power of electric motors!"

The advantage of this book is that the reasoning is simple and clear, making it easy for people to understand. Even people who do not understand electricity at all can gain a considerable understanding after reading this book. Moreover, in the production of electric motors, there are many very simple problems, but after the explanation of the text, they become complicated. The author explains it very thoroughly in this book. The fluent writing style makes people feel not profound. After reading this book, we at least have a general concept of "electricity". This is something we should thank the author for giving us.

Our country has great water power, which can supply us with electricity generation, but we have not been able to make full use of it. This is very regrettable, and it is also because we have not paid close attention to and have a deep and sure understanding of electricity. We always think that electricity is a mysterious thing. In fact, electricity is our close friend, an indispensable thing in daily life. We can use electric power as the motive power of machinery to actively develop our country's industrial and mining industries, but how can we do it without electrical knowledge? First of all, we must know how to apply electric motors. Then, after reading this book, you can start to apply electric motors. Therefore, I believe that anyone who has the ambition to use electric motors but does not have the ability to use electric motors should buy this book and read it. Not only should you read it, but you should also do it yourself. Furthermore, you should use the electric motor creatively.

### Some Opinions on Revising the Publication Law

— Leng Yan

The current Publication Law was promulgated on July 8, 1937. At that time, it was the day after the Lugouqiao Incident occurred. People across the country were wholeheartedly committed to the war of resistance, and did not pay attention to the shortcomings of the Publication Law. After Japan surrendered, and because the country was fragmented and everything was waiting to be rebuilt, the people of the country did not put forward any suggestions for revision. Therefore, the Publication Law has been promulgated for ten years, and the people of the country have never criticized it for its deficiencies. Recently, the period of political tutelage is coming to an end, and constitutional government is just around the corner. The authorities also published some key points for revision in the newspapers on October 31 and November 1. However, the formally revised Publication Law has not yet been announced. Therefore, I would like to write out my humble opinion for everyone to discuss.

A small number of unscrupulous publishers only care about their own interests and do not care about wasting paper, causing readers to suffer losses and infringing on the rights of others. For example, a certain bookstore (of course, referring to a small bookstore) published a book by a certain famous author. In order to sell a few more copies, the content remains exactly the same, and the cover and title may be changed. At the same time, they will be displayed in one place for sale. Readers first buy a certain book, and then see that the title of this book is similar, so they do not examine it carefully and buy it for reference. As a result, they buy something with a different name but the same content, and suffer a financial loss. It seems that the Publication Law should have explicit provisions to ban this kind of trickery by merchants.

Freedom of speech is something that the people of democratic countries should enjoy. However, freedom must also have a limit. The key points for revision have already stated that it is not intended to subvert the National Government or harm the interests of the Republic of China. As long as it meets this standard, it should not be interfered with. However, in recent years, because newspapers have criticized the government and officials for their wrongdoings, reporters have often been beaten, newspaper offices have been destroyed, publications have been torn up, and publications have been banned. This has been seen in the newspapers countless times. Criticism is to hope to get on the right track, not to subvert the government or harm the interests of the country. It seems that the Publication Law should explain this in detail, so that it can be said to protect freedom of speech.

Pornographic publications lead people to indulgence, which not only does not help culture, but also harms people's thoughts and morals. Can this be considered "harming the interests of the Republic of China"? Only paying attention to the "harm" of talking about politics and not paying attention to the "harm" of talking about pornography is inevitably knowing one thing but not knowing the other.

Furthermore, the Publication Law and the Copyright Law are related, and it seems that they should be revised in detail at the same time.

### Secondary English Grammar

— Wang Yuzhou

Authored by Lu Shuxiang, published by Kaiming Bookstore

This book has a total of sixteen chapters, two hundred and ninety-four pages, divided into two volumes. The first volume describes the structure of sentences, and the second volume describes eight types of words. It is extremely suitable for use as a textbook for the first and second grades of senior high school. Below are a few points for introduction.

1.  This book is based on Otto Jespersen's Essentials of English Grammar and Palmer's Grammar of Spoken English, combined with the author's more than ten years of teaching experience.

2.  The text used for explanation strives to be comprehensive in its simplicity, and the sentences used for examples and exercises are relevant to daily life; therefore, reading this book is not only free of any bitter and dull feeling, but also extremely easy to increase the interest in further study.

3.  The structure and usage of sentences occupy half of the book. The book describes in more detail the places that other books omit, and the forms (words, phrases, clauses) of Subject, Object, Complement, etc., and their various positions in the sentence are indicated more clearly.

4.  The example sentences are rich and practical, making it easy for readers to imitate. There are many examples in the application of the three types of Clauses.

5.  Both spoken and written language are taken into account. For example, in spoken language, we say Who did you see? In written language, we say Whom did you see? are all specially explained.

6.  Pronunciation is taken into account. For example, the pronunciation of S and ed at the end of words is not mentioned in ordinary grammar books. This book mentions that in the places where nouns and verbs change in form, they are marked separately after the words, for example: cu"(s); ideas(z); allows(z); asked.(t); expected(id).

In addition to the above points, there are many other features, which can only be understood when reading. I cannot list them one by one. The author was a middle school teacher and has rich teaching experience. He knows the shortcomings and needs of general students. Although he has been teaching at the university in recent years and is famous for his research on Chinese grammar, he still excels in writing this book. From my 30 years of teaching experience, this is a new and most applicable English grammar book, which will be of great help to middle school English teachers.

For such a good book, we cannot help but have the meaning of demanding perfection. I think that the use of punctuation marks, although belonging to the scope of composition, can also be discussed in grammar as an appendix (Lin's Kaiming English Grammar includes this item). Secondly, although the explanation and examples in this book are simpler than other books, there are still a few words that are unfamiliar to middle school students. It seems that they can be extracted, added with Chinese annotations, and attached to the end of the book to make it more convenient for self-study students. I hope that the author will consider our two suggestions when reprinting.

### Gide's "The School for Wives"

— Lu Xian

The Swedish Academy decided to award this year's Nobel Prize for Literature to André Gide, a great contemporary French writer, and declared: "His works are profound in subject matter and perfect in art. The life problems and situations described in his works show his courage to admire the truth and his skill in analyzing psychology."

According to Mr. Bian Zhilin, "The School for Wives" has at least three translations in China: Wang Yilei's "A Young Girl's Dream"; Chen Zhanyuan's "School for Wives"; and Jin Mancheng's "The School for Women". According to Mr. Bian Zhilin's translation, it should be "Female Learning".

This is really a wonderful thing. From the different translations, one can imagine the different styles of each translator.

If "The School for Wives", "Robert", and "Geneviève" are a triptych (Gide said this in the author's preface to "Geneviève"), then "Female Learning" should be the first painting in the triptych.

Obviously, Gide has a strong desire to reveal the secrets of women through the mouths of women themselves. This secret contains a wide range of things: psychology, thoughts, outlook on life, style, character... all within his scope of portrayal. This plan is huge, but we don't have to worry about Gide. His style is always so delicate, refined, and incomparably beautiful, so although his attempt is large and inappropriate, he himself will not get lost. Grasping a small point, he supports the framework of the whole book. In terms of momentum, Gide's book cannot be compared with Romain Rolland's "Jean-Christophe"; in terms of technique, Gide's exquisite skills cannot be matched by others. Especially when women are the object of portrayal, Gide is even more prominent. Turgenev is also good at portraying women, but he cannot help but become superficial. Zola tends to be exaggerated, Tolstoy is too profound, Romain Rolland is too passionate, and only A. Gide deserves to be delicate and refined. He tells the story in a roundabout way, and finally comes to his fatalism: "Women are women". Gide's most wonderful technique is to use small artistic conceptions to express his philosophy. The essays in "The Return of the Prodigal Son" are the best explanation.

I like the book "Female Learning". The whole book is full of beautiful style, from infatuation to thorough understanding, from great happiness to great despair, from the mood of a girl's heart to the deep emotions of a woman... there are extremely beautiful descriptions. Because it is written in the form of a diary, the style is closer to a prose poem than a novel. A. Maurois has also written several small books on the theme of exploring the inner meaning of women's hearts, but compared with Gide, the former's descriptions are inevitably superficial.

Evelyne, a pure woman, like the protagonists in Gide's other novels, is also a beautiful, deep, and stubborn woman. When she was still a girl, she met a handsome young man, Robert, during a wandering. They fell in love and got engaged. Part 1 of "Female Learning" is Evelyne's fragmentary thoughts written before her engagement. She is madly in love with her lover, obviously a little blindly, so the diary is full of the sincere words of a girl, although she says with great understanding: "Seeing that the reason why women live in this world is nothing more than to make their talents. Character. Even more valuable, and all the values are nothing more than appendages to a certain "Mr."'s degree of joy, which really makes me unhappy." But she feels the same way about her lover, Robert.

However, Evelyne's character of being wholeheartedly devoted made her blind for a while. After a long time, the passion faded slightly, and she was originally a person who was almost stubbornly true, so in the end she finally discovered the baseness of Robert's hypocrisy hiding the filth. - Yes, this was twenty years later. Twenty years can bring about great changes in a woman, which is difficult to estimate. According to common sense, even if Evelyne's character has not been assimilated by Robert, it should have been "eroded by time"? But Gide never allows his female characters to be content with fate. Twenty years later, Evelyne not only does not appreciate Robert's hypocrisy, but cannot bear it anymore, like a volcano that has been silent for a long time, she stabs Robert with her passion, stabs her relatives, and also stabs himself.

Evelyne is not comfortable with her environment, not comfortable with her fate, and especially not comfortable with having such a husband. Why is that? Just because a mature woman, a woman who has her own opinions in all aspects, sees the "self-sacrifice" drama of Robert and his ilk, even if it is performed more tragically, it is just a common farce in the world. She tried several times to escape the cage, several times to leave the control of the husband she had so blindly loved, but she could not. The sympathy of the entire society was obviously not on her side, but on the side of the hypocritical and dignified Robert.

Evelyne mentioned her daughter several times in her diary, saying how Geneviève calmly observed the conflict between her parents. Here, she foreshadowed the book "Geneviève".

Gide is good at writing explanatory literary works. Mr. Bian Zhilin commented on his "Return of the Prodigal Son" and said:

"...Regardless of the colorful appearance, the focus of these words is on thoughts or concepts. The most perfect way to express the mystery is to entrust it to symbols, so that the words and metaphors become crystals." In fact, "Female Learning" is also such a symbolic novel, and there is no more appropriate comment than Mr. Bian Zhilin's approval.

If someone compiles a series of books on women's issues, I think Gide's few pamphlets can be included in the series. In China, there are many translators of Gide's works. The most faithful should be Sheng Chenghua, and the one with its own elegant taste should be Bian Zhilin. Li Liewen has also translated some of Gide's works, which are collected in his "Encounter Grass", such as "On Classical Literature", etc., which still retain Gide's unique rhythm. This time, the "Female Learning" that I read was Jin Mancheng's translation, and the writing style is a bit delicious, which may be related to the degree of understanding.

### On the Appreciation of Refined and Popular Art Together

— Wang Qi

In the past, Mr. Ma Yuqing acquired the Ming dynasty editions of Feng Menglong's "Words from the Window" and "Leaning on a Pillow" collections, as well as the first edition of "The Tale of Subduing Demons." He named his study the "Subduing Demons Hall" and also called it the "Non-Eligible for Elegant Appreciation Library," because Mr. Ma was famous domestically for his collection of Yuan and Ming dynasty novels, and unofficial histories have always been discriminated against as being unfit for refined appreciation.

However, these novels are actually suitable for refined appreciation. They are bound with magnetic cyan paper covers, snow-white Lian Shi inner pages, and white silk thread, and come in brocade or blue cloth cases. They should be placed in the rare book room of the National Peiping Library or in some study hall. Compared to their previous circulation and recitation among cart pullers and peddlers, they are simply incomparable. The so-called "unfit for refined appreciation" is nothing but a satirical comment.

Ancient novels have been refined by scholars, and the unrefined common people immediately create new ones. This has been the case from ancient times to the present. In any case, refined people do not innovate; they only steal things from the common people. First, they appreciate them, and then they complain that they are too vulgar and base. So, they refine them until the common people no longer want them. Isn't this the case with Song lyrics, Yuan dramas, Tang dynasty quatrains, and Six Dynasties ballads? Southern opera originated in Wenzhou, while Kunqu opera became popular in Kunshan. Now, I guarantee that the common people in these places will not understand them; they want to sing Tanhuang or other genres. Shanxi Bangzi arrived in Beijing and became Jing Bangzi, which was then refined into "Qinqiang." The Han tune Zhengdiao was also refined into Pi Huang, while the common people still have their own brand-new, vibrant things. Nowadays, Shaoxing opera has been vulgarly refined by people in the cities, and perhaps one day the people of Shaoxing will not understand the so-called "Yue Opera."

It seems that Shen Defu lamented in "Ye Huo Pian" about the popularity of small tunes such as "Hitting Dates with Poles" and "Hanging Branches," considering it a sign of the decline of social morals. In fact, firstly, he forgot about the ancient Yangzhi lyrics and Liuzhi lyrics; secondly, he proved that "Hanging Branches" had not been thoroughly refined. If it really no longer expresses "the decline of social morals," then it means that it has become a "thing of the court," no longer related to the common people.

However, some people have proposed the phrase "refined and popular art together for appreciation." This statement sounds good, but in reality, it is impossible because refined and popular are always opposed and can never "come together." People who appreciate the vulgar things of "lower-class people" will never appreciate "pure white snow." And "Yang A Xie Lu," which wins the harmony of hundreds of people, seems to be a "middle-class element," but who knows that this kind of person is an awkward thing that is neither vulgar nor refined, "neither one," but not "together"!

So, besides vulgar, there is refined; and outside of refined, all is vulgar. How is Chinese refinement produced? Chinese writers plunder the forms of folk literature and deliberately refine them, and then scold those vulgar people thoroughly.

If they get a little more support, they smugly say: "Refined and popular art together for appreciation!"

### On the Inevitable Inferiority of Literature When People are Poor

— Xuan Xuan

I recently read the ninetieth anniversary issue of the American "Atlantic" magazine and was quite moved.

First, although the United States is currently considered the strongest of the strong countries, its nation is really young and immature, and its culture is short-lived and has not yet evolved into a fixed form, far from our country's boast of five thousand years of culture. But they already have a magazine with ninety years of history, and although it is not as "old and virtuous" as the British "Punch," it is enough to be called the eldest brother in the world of magazines. We don't have such a magazine. Those that have vitality either die young or suffer all kinds of torture, eventually becoming unable to exist. "Eastern Magazine" is considered the oldest, with decades of publication history, but who still remembers such a magazine?

Second, among the comprehensive magazines in the United States, "Atlantic" and "Harper's" are considered the most advanced. The former focuses slightly more on literature and art, while the latter pays more attention to thought and political commentary. Although these two things may not really be able to achieve perfection in every article, at least seven out of ten articles have a value worth reading. "Popular" magazines like "Saturday Evening Post" and "Collier's" can have two or three million readers in the United States, but high-level magazines like "Atlantic" and "Harper's" also have more than one hundred thousand people who regularly buy them. This shows the cultural level of Americans: most people are庸俗, but therefore magazines like "Atlantic" can also exist. In our country, square weekly magazines can be "best-selling," but truly weighty high-level publications are either extremely rare, or if they exist, they have no readers, and the result is always closing down. This matter concerns the hundred-year plan of national culture, but who pays attention to these things?

"Atlantic" magazine was founded ninety years ago. At that time, it had the nature of a coterie magazine, but it was started by a publisher and a few writers. The people present were all willing to help, and the result was that it was published. This matter is detailed in the article "The Growth of American Magazines" in the ninetieth anniversary issue of "Atlantic." At that time, the writers who participated in writing were all first-class writers representing the culture of New England (the academic area of the United States). They held the ambition of "publishing the best works of the best contemporary writers to the world." Ninety years later, this goal has been achieved. The founders had this courage, and the readers also had the courage to accept it, so "Atlantic" could shine in the world. Looking back at us, there are not many writers with such a pioneering spirit, and there are almost no publishers with such foresight. The readers, moreover, are muddleheaded and cannot support a good publication. Part of it is due to economic strength, and part of it is due to the prevailing atmosphere, lacking the enthusiasm for reading, creating a vacuum in today's publishing industry.

Third, American magazines like "Atlantic," especially this ninetieth anniversary issue, can be said to have beautiful and inexhaustible content. The "comprehensiveness" has also been achieved to a fairly balanced degree. Look at its several major articles: Einstein on atomic war and peace, the unpublished love letters of Mark Twain, Wells on the pressure factions and foreign policy of the United States Department of State, Sedgwick (the current editor of "Atlantic") on editing techniques, Jones on the beliefs of modern people, Shaw on the cultivation of connoisseurs, and Mao Dun on Madame Bovary. Reading these few has a feeling of "the end of modern essays."

Why do people have so many good articles? First, the editors have vision; second, the publishers are willing to spend money; third, the editors are willing to work hard. It is difficult to achieve the first two, and the third cannot be taken lightly.

Editors with vision will then produce new writers. There are so-called "discoverers" in the foreign literary world, which refers to these editors who are good at spotting talent. Editors with vision will then have articles that feature "the person and the event." Western magazines have published "Hitler in the Eyes of a Female Servant," "My Lover Mussolini," Maurois's "Inside Story of the Collapse of the French Army," "How I Dropped the Atomic Bomb," the Duke of Windsor's "Memoirs," etc. Only the person involved can write about these things, all of which are enough to captivate the world. Why don't Chinese magazines invite Gu Weijun to write "Impressions of Diplomatic Figures"? Why don't they invite Song Ziwen to write "The Art of Borrowing Money"? Ahemaitijiang, a powerful figure in the Northwest, has not yet had anyone write about his origins, and "An Unofficial History of Taking Over" has not yet appeared. The lack of a habit of publishing in China is certainly a major reason, but the lack of editorial vision is also a fact.

It is even more difficult to get publishers to spend money than to take their lives. The American "Life" pictorial specially published three memoirs of the Duke of Windsor, who loved beauty more than his country, but the amount of the fee is still a secret between "Life" and Windsor, and outsiders have no way of finding out. This number must be considerable. It is naturally expensive to buy Churchill's "History of the Second World War." Chinese publishers only want to copy, who would be willing to pay such a high price for manuscripts?

The current lack of good articles to read in China does not have to be entirely attributed to one aspect. This is just a problem of poverty. When people are poor, their ambitions are short-sighted. Therefore, publishers only want to "make a quick buck," and people who write articles can only be known for their quantity. Thinking of this, I can't help but sigh at "Atlantic"!

### A Wrong Move

— Li Li

The fate of hundreds of millions of people in the world is often controlled by just one inadvertent action of certain people. This kind of wrong move is sometimes really incredible.

If one of the finance ministers of King Louis XIV of France was not named Fouquet, then France might almost occupy most of the current British Empire, and the so-called Germany might become a group of harmless small dynasties. It is certainly not wrong for a person's name to be Fouquet, and that is also powerless, but he unnecessarily played tricks, and that was a wrong step. Originally, in ancient France, the meaning of "Fouquet" was "squirrel," and this Fouquet flaunted this small animal on his weapons and adorned it with the inscription: "The sky is the limit." In reality, he was more interested in the ocean than the sky.

Whether he was far-sighted or short-sighted, he decided to advise the King that France should build a two-ocean navy. He believed that with its huge fleet, France could develop commerce wherever its flag flew, and the profits gained would be much greater than fighting constantly on the eastern border. Louis XIV was moved and came to attend a banquet held by Fouquet in his villa on the Seine River in order to listen to his insightful arguments. However, before he could hear the wonderful arguments, he saw wonderful writing: on the door, on the carpets, on the chairs, on the plates, and on the servants' uniforms, there were squirrels everywhere, adorned with inscriptions, declaring that Mr. Fouquet's "limit was the sky"! This, of course, did not suit the taste of the autocratic emperor, so Louis XIV left in anger. Fouquet was dismissed, and the ideal of building an overseas empire naturally went up in smoke. As a result, the French advanced east to the Rhine, and the exhausting wars between Germany and France followed one after another.

Another "wrong move" occurred in 1757, which was later found to have been a big mistake. A clerk in the British War Office refused a pair of applications to serve in the British army. The book came from George Washington, who was famous throughout the world, and was then a colonel in the Virginia militia. Colonel Washington had indeed saved a British army from danger with his bravery, but this guy was a colonial, and his parents were not British, so letting him serve under the local governor was already very preferential treatment. So he became the head of a local self-defense team, and his rank would never be higher than any officer below the rank of lieutenant in the British army. Naturally, Washington had his own plans, he did not forget to forgive; the price of that wrong move was the entire United States. If those applications had been approved at that time, the subsequent events would have been unpredictable!

A century later, in 1857, Britain lost a large part of its empire's heart again. The native soldiers in the East India Company's army were given a batch of cartridges. These cartridges used oiled caps, and on the old guns, these caps had to be bitten off with the mouth so that the gunpowder could be poured into the gun body and the gun body. Part of the oil applied to the cartridges was made of butter, which was sacred and inviolable to Hindus; and the other part was made of lard, which greatly offended Muslims. It was really too coincidental, insulting the entire people of India at once! What a "wrong move" the result was the immediate outbreak of the Indian rebellion.

### Wandering Flowers

— Wang Shenyan

Chapter Four: Two Hearts in Harmony (17)

Qiwan said, "I had a few more drinks today and felt very comfortable as I relieved Chengdou of its administrative duties. Time flies so fast. The last time I came here to watch the boat race was in the summer, and in the blink of an eye it is already late autumn and early winter. How can people not get old!" Zhuzhai smiled and said, "You are in your prime. Why are you sighing about old age!" Qiwan said, "Everyone says I am in my prime, and I also think I am in my prime, but unfortunately, I can't grasp this golden age. With my family environment and my previous work in art, I am afraid I will let this golden age down!" Zhuzhai said, "A person's success comes from struggle. You have already broken through many difficulties, and your future is very promising. Don't be too hesitant." The two talked and talked, and unknowingly had reached the Sound of Flowing Water. Standing on the platform piled with rocks and looking, a round moon had broken through the clouds, and the clear light poured down like silver. Zhuzhai said, "The moonlight is very good tonight. How about we sit here for a while?" As he spoke, he took out a handkerchief, dusted off a stone stool, spread it with a handkerchief, let Qiwan sit down, and sat down next to her. Qiwan looked at the moonlight and said, "The moonlight is too good tonight, but unfortunately the moon is not always round. In a few days, it will wane again!" Zhuzhai said, "The moon has its waxing and waning, which is a fixed cycle. I only believe that people should enjoy life in time and not worry too much!" Qiwan knew that Zhuzhai was comforting her, and she was very touched. She couldn't help but move her body closer to Zhuzhai. She was about to pour out the bitterness in her heart when a cloud suddenly covered the bright moon, and the earth suddenly turned black. Zhuzhai said, "There is a saying in the pear garden world, 'Clouds covering the moon.' Tan Xinpei's voice is bright in the sand, and Mei Lanfang's voice is crisp in the sand. They are all 'clouds covering the moon.' Last night I heard your Yu Tang Chun, and a few sentences were like Mr. Mei's crisp voice, but unfortunately everyone ignored it." Qiwan gently elbowed Zhuzhai and said, "Don't talk nonsense. How can I compare to Mr. Mei!" At this time, the moon had broken through the clouds again, and the earth reappeared with light. Zhuzhai saw Qiwan's beautiful face illuminated by the moonlight and smiled, "Why can't you compare to Mr. Mei? Judging from your age, you are more than thirty years younger than him. Even if he comes on stage again, he will not be as good as before. Don't underestimate yourself too much and be too hesitant." Qiwan said, "My ambitions are very high, and I also want to work hard, but I am limited by my current environment, and it is very difficult to succeed. Now I have learned several ancient costume plays from Mr. Mei, and just adding the costumes is killing me! Now it is not like the era when Mr. Mei sang opera. Whether or not there will be support for singing Mei style opera is a problem. Adding costumes is an even bigger problem."

### Morley's Quotations

— Wen Jie

The trouble with marriage is that there is too little "Wed" and too much "Lock." If people can separate for a while, they can love each other more deeply.

A woman feels quiet when she falls into a love net, and a man talks more when he falls into a love net.

Women exaggerate when they speak in high spirits, because they spend 90% of their lives in "words that can't express everything."

He felt unhappy because his beard was gray. He thought this was his flag of truce, a sign of surrender.

Isaac Newton carved two holes, one for the big cat and one for the small cat. People laughed at him for being stupid, saying that small cats could also use larger holes. May I ask what should be done when two cats want to go through the hole at the same time?

If you turn on the hot water tap first when taking a bath, the bathroom will be full of steam. You should put in the cold water first, and then the hot water you need, so that the bathroom will not be foggy. Perhaps the same is true in our minds. (Excerpted from Christopher Morley's works)

Embroidered Image Chongqing Commentary

### Ode to Big Rats

— Bai Wuweng, Dragon Life Painting

In Sichuan, especially in Chongqing, rats biting people, even biting off the noses of babies, is just like dogs biting people, and does not contain too much news. Cats are so few and so easy to die that they will get an incurable disease after eating rat meat. Of course, the rats can only run rampant. Just looking at their weight of several pounds, you can know the scale of their food intake, and they cannot survive except by stealing. Regarding this, we should blame God for arranging their instincts, but not caring about their food.

What is even more hateful is that gnawing on things that cannot be eaten is the rats' intentional harming of others without benefiting themselves. For example, eating peanuts from a pocket, they must tear the clothes, which is even more hateful than eating a baby's nose. Objectively, for the rats: babies are slightly close to food, but clothes cannot fill the stomach at all. Although the former is more cruel.

People are also like this

In the voice of suppressing the rebellion, it is actually necessary. Even if a little oil is squeezed, such as "big bucket in, small bucket out," the common people will not say anything. Just as there are no cats, they can only accept their fate. However, they must call farmers to pick them from hundreds of miles away in the countryside. After picking them, they deliberately delay the acceptance for many days, causing people to labor and waste time, and are forced to bear many days of expensive food in the city, which is the common complaint of farmers in Sichuan. The corruption in Sichuan has become a trend, and the common people seem to have become accustomed to the abuse of the people by corruption. They have no choice but to seek the next best thing, "Do less of the abuse of the people that does not contribute to corruption," which has become the farmers' requirement for incense to pray for, like the fate of those who rely on the heavens for food due to disaster and crop failure, and can only blame themselves, and only ask not to eat the crops into a barren land.

Not long ago, after the Chongqing refugee station of the General Relief Administration ended, it was surrounded by boatmen, and the chief auditor who could not get on the car or plane had to escape at night, causing an uproar. According to the evidence published when entertaining reporters, in order to wait for the settlement of accounts, the wooden boats were first detained in Hankou, causing the Chongqing boatmen to wait in Hankou for half a year. By the time the boat price was returned, the boatmen had eaten and pawned everything, and the old wives and daughters brought on the boat had been sold in foreign lands.

### Strange Student

— Ze Shi

On December 12th, students from Chengdu Chenghua University marched, posting slogans all over the streets, saying "Rather die than not be nationalized." As the saying goes, death can be heavier than Mount Tai, or lighter than a feather. University students are willing to commit suicide because the school they are studying in is not changed to a national one. Is their death heavier than Mount Tai or lighter than a feather?

To be greedy for life and fear death is human nature. I don't know how many people are starving and freezing all over the world, but there are few suicides. They may be muddleheaded people, only knowing how to prolong their lives, and are not enough to speak of the greatness of death, so let's not discuss them. The "light-hearted" spirit of the dozens and hundreds of students at Chenghua University who said "Rather die than not be nationalized" is truly unprecedented!

I don't understand why the private or national nature of a university is related to the life and death of students. If students are willing to commit suicide if the school is not nationalized, then so many founders, directors, and principals of private universities in the world cannot escape the crime of abetting suicide. There should not be so many private universities in the world, and there should not be so many students and graduates of private universities. Even if it is said that only Chenghua University students will have difficulty surviving if the school is not nationalized, dropping out of school is always better than seeking death. However, those students who marched and posted slogans would rather die than do anything else. Isn't that a strange thing?

China was originally a country that respected the elderly, but now it is a country that respects youth, especially youth and students. Every move of young students is applauded and praised, saying that doing so is to love and protect youth with all their strength. However, youth is youth after all. If you can forgive my disrespect, I want to compare the young students, the future masters of the country, to the children in the family who carry on the family line. The British scholar Russell "once met a lady who argued that children should never be forbidden to do anything; because a child should develop his nature from within, so he should not encounter external obstacles in his development." And Russell asked her: "If his nature leads him to swallow a needle into his stomach, what should he do?" And "Judging from the facts, we cannot but admit that if every child is really allowed to act freely, he will sooner or later swallow a needle into his stomach." (Quoted from Russell's Collection of Skeptical Essays) In China, there are many young mentors who advocate that young students should never be forbidden to do anything. Taking student movements as an example, every time students make a student movement, they all give students unlimited sympathy, no matter what the movement is about. As a result, the slogan of rather dying than not nationalizing the school has also been posted. If Chenghua University really does not change to a national one and the students really go from slogans to practice, wouldn't that be equivalent to a child swallowing a handful of needles into his stomach?

To Mr. Zhang Ruyuan from Danyang: This matter has no contract and is difficult to handle. Furthermore, the description in your letter is unclear and there is no way to answer it. It seems that you can first study it with a local lawyer.

To Mr. Jiang Wenlong from Nantong: The government has no regulations. There was such news once, but it was not officially announced. This matter is rich in temporality and spatiality, and even if there are precedents, they are not suitable for reference.

To Mr. Chen Xingjin from Gangkou Town, Taixian: The manuscript has been transferred to the Jiangsu Provincial Government, and the reply has been approved, saying: "The donated items that you have stated are subject to what village they are from, and what is the actual object.
