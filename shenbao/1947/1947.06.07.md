### US President to Issue Statement Reaffirming Economic Aid to China Policy, Marshall Advocates Early Loans to Our Country

[Our Newspaper Dispatch] San Francisco, 6th Radio: United Press Special Correspondent Hans Wright: President Truman will, within the next few weeks, reaffirm the policy towards China, the content of which is related to clearing up the uncertainties about opening up loans to China. At the same time, Marshall also advocated early loans to China. The original text of the correspondent's Washington telegram is as follows: According to well-informed sources who told the United Press here: "Chairman Chiang's 'expansion' of government work has achieved some success, therefore, it has removed obstacles in opening up the US Export-Import Bank's $500 million loan. In view of this, President Truman is very likely to reaffirm his policy towards China within a few weeks, and it is heard that Secretary of State Marshall strongly agrees with this matter. Secretary Marshall believes that it is a good strategy to provide assistance to the Chinese National Government as soon as possible. In addition, Secretary Marshall is also convinced that there is no chance this year to obtain substantial assistance for China from Congress. According to the amount that the Export-Import Bank has already allocated to lend to China, it does not require congressional approval, but its validity period is June 30."

It is also learned that officials in recent days have received reports from Chinese Northeast diplomatic personnel stating that the Communist army's combat strength in that area has greatly increased, so the concern for the Chinese situation in general has been intensified because of this.

[Our Newspaper Dispatch] San Francisco, 6th Radio: US officials declared that before the US side reaffirms its policy towards China, China will temporarily not submit to the US side a plan regarding the use of the US Export-Import Bank's $500 million loan. According to officials of the bank, China has not yet submitted a plan for the use of the funds, as it is waiting for President Truman's reaffirmation of the policy. It is reported that in the past two weeks, China has prepared the plan, but it will not be submitted until the US policy statement is issued. It is learned that President Truman will exert pressure on the Export-Import Bank to urge it to extend the validity period of the loan, and adopt a lenient policy on the China plan. Regarding the loan, Marshall's views differ significantly from those of the Export-Import Bank. Mr. Marshall observes the matter from the perspective of broad international politics, believing that it is necessary to provide economic and psychological assistance to China as soon as possible, but the viewpoint of the Export-Import Bank is the opposite. Their viewpoint is a narrow commercial perspective. President Truman is now testing public reaction with the military aid to Argentina, and if this reaction is good, then his plan to aid the National Government will be smoothly implemented.

[Central News Agency London, 5th] British Far East expert Green stated today: Although China is currently in turbulent waters, it still has great hope in the future. Mr. Green published a lengthy article in the June issue of the political magazine bi-monthly, in which he made a very insightful analysis of China's current problems. Mr. Green also listed the bright and promising factors of our country, and asked the British people to remember that China has experienced fourteen years of war when judging and evaluating the Chinese situation, and its disasters are worse than those of any other country. Mr. Green continued: China can also place great hope in Chairman Chiang's leadership, which has clearly been able to adapt to the needs of the times. The stern military man of twenty years ago has today become a statesman with a broad vision. His goals are unquestionable, just like his lofty prestige. With the support of Chairman Chiang, enlightening new opinions have been established. China still has to face a perilous road and many frustrating things, but its destination is indeed a bright future.

### US Military Advisory Group Helps Us Establish a New Army, Major General Rooks Reports Details

[Reuters Nanjing, 6th] Major General Rooks hosted reporters today, revealing for the first time the mission of the US Military Advisory Group in China, including assisting in the reorganization of the Ministry of National Defense and military schools, establishing four military training schools, and preparing a long-term plan to improve the effectiveness and education standards of the Chinese army. Major General Rooks strongly stated that since the establishment of the US Military Advisory Group a year ago, it has never provided assistance to or had any relationship with the troops participating in the Chinese war, and has only been engaged in the initial preparation of assisting in the establishment of training and reform plans. This plan will take ten to fifteen years to complete, and its success still depends on the end of the civil war. According to the long-term plan proposed by the Military Advisory Group, people from all departments in China should serve in the military. Before formally enlisting, they must receive military and civic education training so that the trainees can understand the situation in China and common sense of the constitution. In order to assist in carrying out this plan, the US Military Advisory Group has dispatched a total of 750 officers and soldiers stationed in China. In addition, there is also the US Naval Advisory Group of about 300 people. Major General Rooks also said that the US Military Advisory Group has assisted in the reorganization of the Ministry of National Defense. In addition, the reorganized military schools have been mostly established, and their system roughly imitates the West Point Military Academy in the United States. The US Military Advisory Group also assisted in the organization of a staff school and a national defense university. In addition, four schools for training instructors have been established, and there is also an infantry school in the Nanjing area. The US Military Advisory Group will train the Chinese army as soon as possible, but this work cannot be started during the civil war. The plan is to train an infantry division first, and then use it as the core to train other troops. As for the air force training schools, branches have been established in Chengdu, Hangzhou, Hankou, Shanghai and other places. In addition, there is an artillery school in Nanjing and an armored unit school in Xuzhou. Recently, 120 students have graduated from the armored unit school.

### No Combat Training Provided to Avoid Getting Involved in the Vortex of Internal Strife

According to another United Press report, some courses have been added to the training plan in Chengdu, most of which are used to train air force officers. Therefore, after the officers graduate, in addition to being awarded military positions, they are also awarded bachelor's degrees. The current plan is to immediately train an infantry division as part of a large-scale plan for China to have a modern army equal to other countries. However, he pointed out that the advisory group is currently not allowed to provide combat training because the United States does not want to get involved in China's civil war. The current plan excludes training related to combat. The training of land forces has nothing to do with actual military operations. On the other hand, personnel from the air force advisory group are also not allowed to participate in actual combat, but only serve as technicians and instructors for training, as well as maintenance training for equipment and facilities. In the past year, the advisory group has moved several schools to the rear far from the combat zone. At the same time, Marshall also ordered the air force training group in Beiping to move elsewhere to avoid people attacking the US for participating in or helping the Chinese government fight the civil war.

### Mo Dehui Asks for Sick Leave, Chairman Approves by Telegram

[Central News Agency Dispatch] Government member Mo Dehui has been ill in Zhongshan Hospital since returning to Shanghai from Taiwan. It has been a week and he has not recovered. In recent days, his blood pressure has also risen and his body temperature has also increased, so he needs to continue to be hospitalized for treatment. Mr. Mo specially sent a telegram to Chairman Chiang asking for a month's leave. Yesterday, he received the Chairman's reply approving it and expressing his condolences.

I am very concerned. I hope you can rest in peace and recuperate, and I hope you will recover soon. Zhongzheng has already affixed the seal of the Jiangfu."

### Kaiyuan and Wulajie Recaptured, Du Yuming Says Situation Can Be Changed, Old Troops of Ma Zhanshan Rise Up Against Communist Army

[Our Newspaper Changchun, 6th] A certain unit of the National Army captured Wulajie, north of Jilin, at five o'clock in the morning. Most of the Communist army in northern Jilin transferred to Jiangmifeng, near Jidong. In addition, the Xiyangguo Station on the Jihai Line was captured by the Communist army yesterday. Wulajie was lost on the 19th of last month when our army strategically withdrew, and it has been 18 days since then.

[Central News Agency Changchun, 6th] Military News: (1) The area surrounding Changchun has been calm for several days. (2) A certain unit of the National Army in Jilin has been searching in the Jiangdong area for several days, giving the Communist army attempting to stir up trouble a great blow. At about 4:00 AM on the 5th, the National Army recaptured Wulajie. Wulajie is an important town on the edge of the Jiang River in northeastern Jilin. The Communist army originally stationed in the area was the 78th Regiment of the Independent 3rd Division, which was reorganized from the security team, with a part of the cavalry attached. Since the 3rd, it has been fleeing to Tiangang, and it has announced that it will join the Communist army that fled north from Panshi to attack Jilin. After the National Army recaptured Wulajie, the Communist army in the area fled in all directions. As of the 6th, there has been no major change in the war situation in eastern Jilin. (3) The mobile corps of the National Army recaptured Kaiyuan on the morning of the 5th and is now advancing north along the Changshen Line with two wings covering it.

[Our Newspaper Shenyang, 6th] Xiong Shihui, Ma Zhanshan, and others went to Du Yuming's official residence one after another on the morning of the 6th to discuss the war situation.

[Our Newspaper Shenyang, 6th] Zhao Jiaxiang broadcasted to the citizens on the current situation at the Shenyang Broadcasting Station at 8:00 PM on the afternoon of the 6th in his capacity as the commander of the garrison in order to avoid disturbing the police. Zhao said: Shenyang is only allowed to exist, and no mistakes are allowed.

[Our Newspaper Shenyang, 6th] Du Yuming recovered from his leg illness and met with reporters for the first time on the 6th. Talking about the avoidance of the situation in Northeast China, he said: The Communist army tried to seize Changchun, Jilin, and Siping and continued to flee south without success. Now most of its forces are concentrated between Kaiyuan and Qingyuan, numbering about 100,000 people, attempting to take the opportunity to expand the chaos. The National Army's strategy has shown that it can evacuate empty and unimportant areas and implement concentration to greatly reduce the strength of the Communist army. A decisive battle may be launched in the near future, and the situation will be able to change. When asked about the feelings of people who hastily evacuated Shenyang, it was said that this was a blessing for Shenyang, because it can not only avoid the scourge of floating capital, but also make sense to spend money on escaping. In the short term, it will restrict those people from coming back again.

[Central News Agency Tieling, 5th] After the reporter arrived in Kaiyuan and stayed for half a day, he strategically retreated with the army to Tieling, ten kilometers to the south. Tieling is currently an important strategic stronghold north of Shenyang. The brave and good-fighting New Sixth Army is preparing to give the invading Communist army a annihilating blow. The people of the whole county are mobilized day and night to assist in the construction of city defenses. The impregnable fortifications have been completed in five days. The people of Tieling are at peace, and there is no atmosphere of war. Shops are open as usual, and prices have also fluctuated little.

[Our Newspaper Shenyang, 6th] According to reports, the National Army in the Sanjiazi, Cangshi Nankou, and Qian Nanzamu areas north of Yingxi on the Shenhai Line has made a strategic retreat, and the train is open to Yingxi.

[Central News Agency Shenyang, 6th] The war situation east of Putian Store and Xinglong Fort was fierce. The National Army moved north according to the planned plan at noon on the 4th.

[Our Newspaper Changchun, 6th] The National Army's sweeping troops approached Yitong County in the southeast of Changchun. The county was attacked by the Communist army for a week, and County Mayor Yi Zhuzhang led the security regiment and the police to fight hard alone. Finally, due to the disparity in strength, they retreated in the morning. It is also reported that the Communist army based in Huaide is currently retreating to Yangjiacheng to the west, and the National Army can fully control the area near Huaide.

[Our Newspaper Shenyang, 6th] When the reporter asked Du Yuming about the matter that Ma Zhanshan's troops north of the Songhua River rose up against the Communist army, threatening Harbin, Du said: This is indeed the case in the Hulun area.

[Central News Agency Jilin, 7th] It is widely rumored here that Hulun and other places near Harbin have been occupied by the underground army, and its troops are the old troops of the anti-Japanese leader Xie Wendong (Xie was solved by Lin Biao after the liberation), but the military has not been able to confirm this news. However, according to people from that side, the rear of the Communist army is indeed extremely empty, and the momentum of the underground army is greatly strengthened. This statement is very likely.

### Zhang Guangzhong, Commander of the Communist Army in Southern Shandong, Injured

[Our Newspaper Xuzhou, 6th] The remnants of Zhang Guangzhong's Southern Shandong Military Region were almost completely wiped out on the afternoon of the 5th.

### Rumors of Martial Law in Macau

[Our Newspaper Guangzhou, 6th] It is widely rumored that the Portuguese government in Macau has announced martial law to prevent Chinese troops from entering at any time. The reporter specially interviewed the provincial government spokesman (Director of the News Department Xiao Weimin), who said that this statement is too early. The government has not made any preparations at present. Moreover, this matter can be resolved diplomatically, and it is believed that force will not be used. However, the recovery of Macau has become a unanimous request of the people of the whole country, and the people here are also paying considerable attention to this. According to visitors from Macau, the market there is quite chaotic, people are worried, business is sluggish, and Chinese newspapers have long been banned from import. It is also rumored that Macau has sent plainclothes personnel to sneak in to inquire about the actions of our authorities. People here said that if the actions of the Macau government are true, then such a nervous move is ridiculous.

### Address of the Beijing Office of the Democratic League Has Been Designated

According to a certain important official who told the reporter, the headquarters of the Democratic League should be located in the capital, but because the chairman of the league is in Shanghai, in order to facilitate contact, the past method will still be maintained in the future, that is, important officials will travel between Beijing and Shanghai on a regular basis to establish contact. As for the rumors that the Democratic League will move to Hong Kong, they are completely untrue.

It was included in the agenda and submitted for discussion at the State Council meeting on the 6th. First, the Civil Affairs Office read out the full text of the peace plan. Members Wang Shijie and Niu Yongjian and other organizations spoke, all agreeing that peace is the consistent requirement of the government and the people today, but it should be studied how to promote its realization. Chairman Chiang then reiterated that peaceful resolution of national affairs is the consistent policy of the government, and hoped that all members would study it in detail and propose concrete implementation measures.

### Public and Private Shipping Industry Freight Rates Approved for Independent Negotiation; Government Subsidies Discontinued from This Month

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 6th] Shipping industry freight rates were approved for adjustment starting in June, as passed by the State Council meeting on the 6th. This measure includes both privately-owned and state-owned shipping businesses. Government subsidies for the industry will also cease from the same month. Going forward, freight rates will be determined independently by the industry. This proposal was put forward by Premier Zhang Qun, with the reasoning that: current freight rates were approved in December of last year, with subsidies implemented starting in March of this year. However, due to soaring prices, the current subsidy amount is less than one-tenth of the losses. The National Price Commission has already decided to allow the private sector to negotiate prices independently, so the state-owned sector should be treated similarly.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 6th] The five subgroups under the National Economic Commission will convene meetings within the week to thoroughly discuss issues such as military expenditure, financial and monetary policies, food, the sale of state-owned enterprises, and the general budget, in order to submit them to the Commission's third general meeting next Monday. Furthermore, the Economic Commission held a review meeting on the afternoon of the 6th to review the procedural rules.

### National Water Conservancy Conference Opens; Chairman Chiang and Premier Zhang Issue Special Admonitions; Minister Xue Delivers Speech, Proposing Three Points

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 6th] The opening of the National Water Conservancy Conference and the memorial ceremony for the birth of Yu the Great were held at the Public Recreation Society at 9:00 AM on the 6th, presided over by Xue Dubi, Minister of Water Conservancy. Over a hundred representatives from various regions attended, including Chen Guofu, former member of the Water Conservancy Commission, Zhang Hanying, design committee member of the Central Design Bureau, and Shen Yi, Mayor of Nanjing. The venue was specially decorated, with charts and graphs of water conservancy designs and implementation progress hung throughout the hall. A large banner with the four characters "The Spirit of Yu the Great" was hung above the portrait of the Founding Father. A statue of Yu the Great was placed below the portrait of the Founding Father, making the venue resemble an exhibition hall. After the formal ceremonies, Minister Xue delivered the opening address, putting forward three points. Next, the admonition from Chairman Chiang of the National Government was respectfully read. Deputy Secretary Shen then read the admonition from Premier Zhang Qun of the Executive Yuan. Subsequently, guests Chen Guofu, Zhang Hanying, Fu Rulin, and Shen Yi delivered speeches one after another. Finally, the Yu the Great memorial was sung, followed by a group photo and adjournment.

Minister Xue's opening address briefly stated: How to actively promote water conservancy nationwide in the future depends on close internal and external connections, unity from top to bottom, collective effort, and joint dedication to achieve success, in order to create a brilliant future for water conservancy. He hoped that this conference would complete three tasks: First, determine the priorities and urgency of water conservancy construction and the matters that should be developed and reformed; second, review the advantages and disadvantages of the implementation of the Water Law and prepare to revise other water conservancy laws; third, study the strategies for connecting and coordinating central and local water conservancy construction. In addition, Xue also hoped that the conference would conduct detailed discussions and formulate plans on the advancement of water conservancy science, the training of water conservancy talent, the fundraising of water conservancy funds, as well as related personnel and financial matters.

Chairman's Admonition: Encouraging Continued Efforts

The full text of Chairman Chiang's admonition is as follows: "China is an agricultural country, and since ancient times, the government and the people have attached great importance to water conservancy. Its rise and fall are sufficient to affect the governance of politics and the prosperity of the country. In modern times, with the rise of industry and commerce, water conservancy undertakings have been promoted daily, and its relationship to the national economy and people's livelihood is even more critical. The Founding Father personally drafted the industrial plan, which also included important instructions on this matter. Now, as the War of Resistance has been won and the country is being built, promoting water conservancy is the most important part of economic construction. Considering that water conservancy undertakings are arduous, simply put, they are nothing more than promoting benefits and eliminating harm. The majority of China's population are farmers, and what farmers need most in their actual lives today is drought and flood prevention, sufficient clothing and food. In recent years, domestic water conservancy projects, with historical experience and scientific methods, have been successfully completed, effectively promoting benefits and eliminating harm; for example, the previous dredging of the Huai River, the construction of water diversion channels and dams, and even the recent blocking of the Yellow River breach, are all remarkable achievements. However, many important water conservancy constructions have not yet begun, and the road ahead is long, not allowing a day of leisure. It is hoped that the responsible authorities will weigh the urgency and continue to focus on the repair and prevention of rivers and the irrigation of farmland, and further organize waterways and develop hydropower. In particular, engineering and administration must be closely linked, and the central and local authorities must cooperate fully, so that they can connect like arms and fingers, treating both the symptoms and the root causes. Water conservancy workers should continue to work hard, seeking to contribute, with the long-term goal of inheriting the legacy of Yu the Great in establishing the mountains and rivers, and the immediate goal of realizing the legacy of the Founding Father's industrial plan, so that the nation's prosperity and happiness can be achieved soon. Now, as the National Water Conservancy Conference opens, I offer these words for mutual encouragement. Zhongzheng, Chen, Shi."

Premier Zhang's Address: Pointing out Three Key Points

Premier Zhang was unable to attend due to attending a State Council meeting, so he sent a written admonition. He pointed out that to achieve food self-sufficiency, it is necessary to strive to develop water conservancy, and the capital for industrialization must be sought from agriculture. Zhang pointed out that there should be three key points for water conservancy in China today: (1) The purpose of water conservancy is to promote benefits and eliminate disasters. There must be a very practical and precise plan for how water conservancy should be carried out in a certain area and how water disasters should be eliminated in a certain area. (2) Water conservancy projects require a lot of funding. Now, after the war, the national treasury is tight. The domestic order has not yet been restored, and financial and material resources are very difficult. We must achieve the most results with the least amount of funding and the most simple materials. (3) The Ministry of Water Conservancy is a government agency, but water conservancy is not just a government undertaking. We must encourage private enterprise and utilize foreign investment to make China's water conservancy construction universal in terms of region and rapid in terms of time.

Finally, Zhang encouraged everyone to "take the spirit of Yu the Great as their spirit and the cause of Yu the Great as their cause, so that China's water conservancy cause can rapidly promote agricultural prosperity and then seek to establish industry."

General Assembly Telegram: Paying Respects to the Chairman

The preparatory meeting was held after the opening ceremony. Chairman Xue Dubi decided to establish a secretariat and passed the review rules. Finally, Zhang Hanying made a temporary motion: In the name of the General Assembly, send a telegram to Chairman Chiang of the National Government to pay respects. The telegram was passed at the first General Assembly. The original telegram is as follows: "To Chairman Chiang of the National Government: Your Excellency leads the War of Resistance and promotes constitutional government, your prestige has spread far and wide, laying the foundation of the country in safety and extending benefits to the people, all nations admire and the world respects. We are gathered in the capital to plan for major water conservancy projects, and we are deeply inspired by your instructions. We will respectfully abide by them and live up to your expectations. We pay our respects, hoping you will heed our words. The entire membership of the National Water Conservancy Conference respectfully bows."

The first General Assembly was held at 3:00 PM on the 6th, with 66 members in attendance. First, Xue Dubi announced the text of the telegram to Chairman Chiang, and then the entire body stood in silence to mourn water conservancy expert Li Yizhi. Next, Cai Banglin, Director of the Water Administration Department of the Ministry, reported on the situation of the Ministry of Water Conservancy. Then, representatives from various regions reported on the general situation of water conservancy work in their respective regions. Zhang Xihuan and Xue Luheng reported on the situation in Taiwan, Dong Wenqi reported on the situation in Northeast China, Tu Da reported on the situation of water conservancy in Jiangsu, Liu Zhongmi represented Shaanxi, Cao Zhi represented Shanxi, Song Tong represented Henan, Li Jie represented Hebei, and Wang Zhichao represented Shandong, reporting on the water conservancy construction in their respective regions.

### Henan Cooperative Management Office Director Embezzles Funds; Tian Mengjia Suspended from Duty and Investigated; Tian is Liu Maoen's Brother-in-Law

[Our Kaifeng Dispatch, 5th] Wang Youmei, a member of the Henan Provincial Assembly, sharply criticized Tian Mengjia, Director of the Cooperative Management Office, for using his position to embezzle funds and dereliction of duty, and suggested that the government thoroughly investigate and severely punish him. The people of Henan are closely watching the development of this case, because Tian Mengjia is the brother-in-law of Chairman Liu. Whether Mr. Liu protects Mr. Tian can be seen from his attitude towards this case. The Henan-Shandong Supervisory Envoy Office has also filed a charge against Tian Mengjia's embezzlement case with the provincial government and the local court. This afternoon, the reporter specifically asked Chairman Liu about this matter at the provincial government. According to what Mr. Liu told the reporter: After the provincial government received the charge from the Supervisory Envoy Office, it has suspended Tian Mengjia from his duties for investigation. If evidence of embezzlement is found in the future, he will naturally be punished by law. Even if no evidence is found, he does not intend to reinstate him, because he is a relative of mine. For the sake of the overall situation in Henan, I have to sacrifice him. Mr. Liu also said: I am willing to sincerely accept the accusations from all parties, and I am unwilling to make any defenses or explanations for the misunderstandings, and I do not want to plan any countermeasures. Everything is left to public opinion. Before I am allowed to resign, I will still do my best to serve my hometown, and other things are not what I care about.

Editorial

### Hopes for Future Water Conservancy Construction

The National Water Conservancy Conference was held yesterday, on Engineers' Day, in Nanjing, with the meeting scheduled to last for six days. This is the first national water conservancy conference since the establishment of the Ministry of Water Conservancy. In addition to the heads of the various departments, many water conservancy engineering experts are also attending. The theme of this session is the review of current water conservancy work, the planning of post-war water conservancy construction, the connection and cooperation of central and local water conservancy undertakings, and other related water conservancy matters. We are deeply aware of the importance of post-war water conservancy undertakings and have unlimited expectations for the convening of this water conservancy conference.

China is an agricultural country, and since ancient times, the government and the people have attached great importance to farmland water conservancy and river defense projects. Historically, the rise and fall of water conservancy have been closely related to the governance of politics and the prosperity of the country. During the Han Dynasty, Jia Rang strongly advocated that dredging rivers and canals has three benefits and not doing so has three harms. Therefore, his three strategies for river management have been regarded as the standard by river officials of all dynasties. During the Song Dynasty, Wang Anshi vigorously promoted farmland water conservancy when he was in power and reforming the law, which was very active. Later, Gu Tinglin said that the way to govern the country and benefit the people is to strongly advocate the construction of rivers and canals, which can "return the hearts of the people all over the world and make them prioritize righteousness before profit" as the top priority of governance. It is sufficient to say that the harm to the country is the lack of water conservancy; and the benefit to the country lies in dredging rivers and canals, benefiting the people, and blessing the country. With the advancement of modern science, natural forces have become publicly available resources; the TVA water conservancy project in Tennessee is the most valuable resource for the American national economy, and the supply of industrial power is endless. China is building a nation based on agriculture and industry. The need for modern water conservancy construction is not only to prevent floods passively, but also to facilitate irrigation actively and develop industrial power. This is of great importance to the future of the national economy. After the victory and restoration, the successful blocking of the Yellow River Huayuankou is considered a major construction project completed by the government; however, the closure of the Yellow River breach is a passive and unfavorable construction. Its active water conservancy construction relies on the efforts of the newly established Ministry of Water Conservancy and the concentrated wisdom of water conservancy engineering experts across the country. Here are some important water conservancy works, roughly listed for reference by the water conservancy authorities and water conservancy engineering experts attending the meeting.

First, the Yellow River has breached its banks for the past ten years, flooding more than four provinces. On March 15 of this year, the river was closed, and the people in the vast flood zone celebrated together. The government has rewarded the meritorious service of the river workers. People across the country are paying close attention to this great project. Although the flood in the flood zone has passed, there are still many outstanding issues, such as the water conservancy projects related to the Jialu River, Ying River, Fei River, Wo River, and Hui River, all of which have been silted up by mud and sand due to the flooding of the Yellow River. The old river channels have disappeared. In the future, it will be necessary to engage in well sinking, reservoir storage, and opening of river channels in the flood zone. Although the progress of this project is not as urgent as waiting for food for refugees, if it cannot be properly handled, it will cause nine million mu of fertile land in the flood zone to become a desolate desert after the year. However, this project requires a lot of funding, and it is questionable whether it can be done one by one given the current financial situation. It is hoped that the water conservancy authorities and experts can have meticulous plans.

Second, the Yangtze River is the lifeline of China. Today, to promote water conservancy on the Yangtze River, it is necessary to regulate Dongting Lake. Hunan has always been a rice-producing area, and the richest source of rice lies in the fertile land along Dongting Lake. In recent years, the soil in Dongting has been silted up. Every year, the water rises in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, and the water flowing into Dongting Lake from Hunan cannot be accommodated, resulting in floods. It is said that the bottom of Dongting Lake has been silted up into a vast mudflat, which is not conducive to the discharge of river water, resulting in a dispute over the so-called digging up of "Tianyou Weir". Now, the water conservancy authorities have established the Dongting Lake Engineering Office, sent engineering personnel to Hunan, and allocated special funds to manage Dongting. If this project can be realized, its value will be second only to the closure of the Yellow River. It is hoped that the water conservancy authorities will proceed quickly and cooperate effectively with the people of Hunan and Hubei to manage Dongting; and it is hoped that the construction of levees will be expanded, and that they will cooperate with local governments to design the opening and closing of levee highways. If this is the case, the economic and transportation value of the future Dongting Lakeside will become more and more important, benefiting the provinces of Hunan and Hubei in no small way.

Third, the Yangtze River water conservancy project is mutually related to the Yichang Three Gorges water gate "Yang Yu An" YVA water conservancy project, also known as the "Savage Plan." This is the largest modern water conservancy construction, and the design has been completed for a long time. According to the original plan, mountains and rocks are excavated in Yichang to form tunnels; power plants are established in the tunnels, with a power generation capacity of 10 million kilowatts. In addition to supplying the area within a 300-mile radius of the water gate, high-voltage lines can connect Nanjing to the east, Chengdu to the west, Guiyang to the south, and Tianshui to the north. The number of people benefiting is more than the entire population of the United States. Not only will Yangtze River irrigation be improved, and the river water will be raised year-round to facilitate the navigation of large ships, but it will also help the industrial construction of the southwestern provinces, which is of great importance to the future of national construction. Now, the Executive Yuan, feeling that the national treasury is thin, considers the Yang Yu An water conservancy project to be a "non-urgent measure" and has decided to stop surveying the water volume project. If it is unfortunately abandoned halfway, this is a phenomenon of "rivers running down" and is very unwise. It is hoped that the water conservancy authorities and water conservancy engineering experts will strive to ensure that this project is not completely abandoned, even if the engineering personnel endure hardship and save money, they must gradually complete this unique modern water conservancy project to lay the foundation for the country's industrialization. At the same time, it is also hoped that the Executive Yuan authorities will carry out a construction project in the midst of the current turbulent situation to comfort the people, and must not stop halfway due to fear of choking. Entrepreneurship is inherently difficult and needs to be done in difficulty.

The above discussion is only about the larger water conservancy construction projects at present; as for the opening of small local water conservancy projects in various provinces, and technical cooperation with foreign countries, and the collection of water conservancy construction funds, etc., it is hoped that this meeting will have a practical plan, and in the future, the spirit of overcoming floods will be thoroughly implemented. The future of the construction of a new China is promising and bright.

### Practicing Public Office for Private Gain, Corruption, and Malpractice: Sheng Shicai Receives a Reprimand; The Commission on Disciplinary Action for Political Officials Issues a Resolution

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 6th] Sheng Shicai, former Chairman of the Xinjiang Provincial Government, was found to have practiced public office for private gain, engaged in corruption, and violated the law during his tenure. Following a complaint by the Dihua Uyghur General Association, the Control Yuan investigated and confirmed the evidence of his crimes. A proposal for impeachment was submitted, and the National Government transferred the case to the Commission on Disciplinary Action for Political Officials for review. The review has been completed, and it has been decided: Sheng Shicai will receive a reprimand. The full text of the resolution is as follows:

Ruling: Sheng Shicai receives a reprimand.

Facts: The Control Yuan received complaints from organizations such as the Xinjiang Dihua Uyghur General Association, accusing Sheng Shicai, the former Chairman of the province, of practicing public office for private gain, engaging in corruption, and violating the law. The Control Yuan instructed the Xinjiang Control Commissioner's Office to investigate. The report stated that the Xinjiang Police Department originally operated the Yixin Soap Factory. Between 1938 and 1939, the factory purchased hundreds of thousands of catties of cotton. In the spring of 1943, Tie Kun, the factory's manager, was ordered to secretly engage in business for Sheng Shicai. He was instructed to devalue and embezzle over 400,000 catties of cotton from the factory's inventory, transport it to Gansu for sale, and use the proceeds to purchase a large quantity of sundry goods for transport to Dihua. In October 1944, these goods were resold for 8,465,000 New Currency. In September of the same year, before Sheng Shicai was transferred internally, Tie Kun took the funds, totaling over 70 million Legal Currency (including funds from other businesses), to Lanzhou and deposited them in the Overseas Chinese Bank to establish a factory. In the winter of the same year, the former Director of the Police Department, Li Yingqi, and others telegraphed the central government, requesting that these 70 million plus Legal Currency be allocated to aid the Northeastern refugees who had suffered in Xinjiang. After receiving this information, Sheng Shicai also submitted a report, claiming that the deposit was a special fund provided by the central government for him to maintain special operations. He then ordered Tie Kun to manage the business on his behalf. Subsequently, Tie Kun made multiple deliveries of the funds and published a statement to explain the process and absolve himself of responsibility. After review, Control Commissioner Wang Shu concluded that Sheng Shicai, the former Chairman of Xinjiang Province, had practiced public office for private gain, engaged in corruption, and sought personal profit, which was a violation of the law. He proposed impeachment and requested disciplinary action. Control Commissioners Zhang Qingzhen, Wang Pijiang, and Liu Chengyu reviewed the case and found it to be valid. The Control Yuan submitted the case to the National Government, which then transferred it to the Commission.

Reasoning: The accused, Sheng Shicai, argued that Xinjiang Province was isolated beyond the borders, and the ethnic groups were complex. It was essential to understand the internal and external situations and strengthen intelligence work. However, this could not be done without a significant amount of funds, and the confidentiality was paramount, unlike ordinary expense or confidential expense expenditures that could be reviewed. Therefore, to maintain confidentiality and reduce the burden on the provincial treasury, he arranged for the cotton transport and sale, using the profits to support special confidential expenses. The purchased cotton was handled at the market price at the time, and there was no devaluation. Furthermore, when Sheng Shicai was transferred away from Xinjiang, the cotton transport and sale business had not yet been settled. At that time, it was estimated that there would be a surplus of about 30 million. Later, the Gansu Provincial Security Command pursued the handler, Tie Kun, and recovered the funds. The actual surplus was 48 million (as evidenced by the Gansu Provincial Security Command's document on the handling of Tie Kun's payment) plus 10 million in interest. After deducting 3 million for Tie Kun, the remaining 55 million was received by Sheng Shicai. The original accusation of over 70 million was incorrect. In addition to cotton, there were no other businesses. The statement in the original accusation about including funds from other businesses was untrue. Regarding the cotton transport and sale process and the method of using the profits as special confidential expenses, as well as whether the remaining funds should be handed over to the provincial treasury or used to subsidize Sheng Shicai himself and the living expenses of poor former subordinates from Xinjiang, he submitted a report to the central government for review and instructions on November 19, 1944. On November 26th, it was approved for use as living expenses for Sheng Shicai and others. He then successively provided assistance to poor former subordinates returning from Xinjiang, totaling 56,072,576 National Currency. The approval date was before Li Pulin and others telegraphed requesting the funds be used for relief. The original accusation that Sheng Shicai, after receiving the information, submitted a report falsely claiming that the deposit was a special fund provided by the central government was not only chronologically incorrect, as Sheng Shicai could not have received the information, but the content of the report was also inconsistent with the actual situation, and it was merely speculation. After reviewing the documents submitted by the accused, the Commission found that the claims regarding the cotton transport and sale process, the method of using the profits as special confidential expenses, the subsidy of the remaining funds for himself and his former subordinates' living expenses, and the approval of the report were not fabricated and should not be questioned. However, the Commission found that the accused began purchasing cotton in the spring of 1943, but did not report the process until November 1944, after he was transferred internally from Xinjiang. Even if the motive for transporting cotton was to meet official needs, proceeding without prior approval was inappropriate, and the fault of violating the law cannot be denied.

Based on the above conclusions, the accused, Sheng Shicai, committed an act described in Article 2, Paragraph 1 of the Law on Disciplinary Action for Public Servants. In accordance with Article 3, Paragraph 1, Item 5 of the same law, the decision is as stated in the ruling.

### Truman is Determined to Implement the U.S. Foreign Aid Plan and Refutes the Views Held by Taft

The Foreign Relief Bill Will Be Gradually Implemented

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 5th] Regarding the Republican Senator Taft's criticism that the U.S. government has abandoned its policy of suppressing prices and used a large amount of funds abroad, resulting in a significant increase in the cost of living for the American people, President Truman held a press conference and issued a lengthy statement in response, stating that the government will not abandon its foreign relief plan due to criticism from some Republicans regarding economic issues. To say that the U.S. must abandon its foreign relief plan because it needs to redouble its efforts in the economic field is tantamount to saying that the U.S. should have stopped its war efforts during the war because of domestic economic problems. The foreign relief plan places a heavy burden on the U.S. economy, but price suppression depends on domestic efforts. My request for the business community to voluntarily suppress prices means that if the U.S. wants its economy to be satisfactory to all, it must replace government control with the reason of the business community. Senator Taft's economic theory is flawed. He is completely bound by the old economic cycle theory, which is the alternation between periods of prosperity and depression. I completely oppose this economic defeatism and absolutely cannot agree with it.

[United Press, Washington, 5th] After President Truman announced the appointment of Allen to head the U.S. foreign offices of the international relief program, Allen told reporters that "currently, no foreign personnel have been sent to China, nor will aid to China be implemented immediately." He said that he hopes to go to Rome within two weeks to organize a relief office. According to the $350 million foreign relief bill passed by the U.S. Congress, aid will be provided to places such as Italy, Hungary, Romania, Trieste, and China.

[Reuters, Washington, 5th] The Joint Economic Committee of the House and Senate has begun to study the price issue and has sent written questions to leaders in the industrial, commercial, agricultural, and financial sectors, as well as labor union authorities, requesting their opinions. This committee, formerly the Joint Committee on the Economic Report, is tasked with providing legislative recommendations based on President Truman's report on the economic situation.

[United Press, London, 6th] British authorities recently announced that the British government, following Marshall's European relief proposal, will cooperate with the U.S. to take emergency measures.

### Griswold Appointed Head of Delegation to Promote the U.S. Aid to Greece Plan; U.S. Military Delegation Inspects the Dardanelles

[United Press, Washington, 5th] President Truman today appointed Griswold, the former governor of Nebraska, as the leader of the U.S. delegation to Greece to carry out the U.S. aid plan. At the same time, Allen, a former Red Cross executive, was appointed as the executive commissioner of the $350 million relief fund. This relief fund is completely separate from the $400 million aid to Greece and Turkey. The personnel to manage aid to Turkey have not yet been determined.

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 6th] Griswold stated in a radio address today that the U.S., given its position, should strive to prevent the recurrence of war. I am now appointed to this position by President Truman and completely agree with the Truman Doctrine. In order to address the current problems, I also advocate using economic power to prevent war, which is better than sending young people to the battlefield again. I am now taking up my new position in Greece and will carry out my duties in accordance with the laws of the House and the President.

[United Press, Ankara, 5th] The U.S. military delegation visiting Turkey recently began a short inspection in the Dardanelles area, which is a strategic location that the Soviet Union has requested to be jointly managed with Turkey.

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 5th] Regarding the U.S. shipping hundreds of millions of dollars worth of surplus materials to Greece and Turkey, the War Assets Administration recently stated that negotiations have begun. These materials will be given priority delivery and will be monitored by President Truman. Among them is a large amount of military equipment.

### Eleanor Roosevelt Advocates a Three-Power Conference

[United Press, Los Angeles, 5th] Eleanor Roosevelt recently gave a speech here, warning that the U.S.'s tendency to encircle the Soviet Union will inevitably destroy the United Nations and advocating for a three-power conference to seek a complete understanding. Roosevelt said that the United Nations cannot exist without the Soviet Union's participation. For example, the League of Nations did not last long because the U.S. did not participate. Regardless of our differences of opinion with other countries, we must be patient and live together. The Soviet Union now recognizes its right to protect its sphere of influence in Europe, just as the U.S. protects Latin America.

### U.S. Agrees to Open Japanese Trade; Japanese Finance Minister Asks for Prompt Determination of Exchange Rate

[New Asia News Agency, Tokyo, 6th] People here generally feel extremely excited about the U.S. government's official statement on the 5th, allowing private foreign trade in Japan within two months. Finance Minister Yano specifically made a statement stating that the biggest obstacles to reopening foreign trade and stabilizing the people's livelihood in Japan are the inability to determine the foreign exchange rate. In order to prepare for the reopening of private foreign trade, we first hope that the Allied countries will quickly decide on the exchange rate issue.

### U.S. Senate Formally Approves Peace Treaties with Italy, Romania, Bulgaria, and Hungary

Effective Only After Approval by France and the Soviet Union

[Reuters, Washington, 5th] The U.S. Senate tonight approved the peace treaties with Italy, Romania, Bulgaria, and Hungary. The first vote was on the Italian treaty, which passed by a vote of 79 to 10. The peace treaties with Romania, Bulgaria, and Hungary were then passed in turn by voice vote. Prior to the vote, opposition leader Democratic Senator Fulbright made a final attempt to delay the approval of the treaties until January next year. This amendment was defeated by a vote of 67 to 22. Senator Connolly made a final appeal before the vote, saying that refusing to approve the treaty with Italy could cause chaos in Italy and allow communism to take the opportunity to invade Italy. The opposition was exceptionally weak in today's debate. Democratic Senator McMahon said, "I believe that whether or not the treaty with Italy is approved has little impact on lasting world peace. The U.S.'s task is only to prevent Italy from following in Hungary's footsteps and falling into the conspiracy of the Communist Party. If Italy becomes a Communist vassal, then France will enter the same path in a few weeks. If so, then the goal that Hitler intended to complete can be completed by the Soviet Union." McMahon also expressed fear about the situation after British and American troops withdraw from Italy. He said, "The Soviet Union has invaded Hungary, while Britain and the United States will withdraw from Italy. This withdrawal may be a signal for the Soviet Union to acquire Italy." The treaties with the former satellite states of Germany have now been approved by Britain and the United States and are awaiting approval by the Soviet Union and France. The approvals must be sent to Paris or Moscow before they can take effect.

### Bulgarian Anti-Soviet Leader Petkov Arrested; Bulgarian Prime Minister Criticizes the Truman Doctrine

[Our Newspaper] London, 6th, Broadcast: The movement to purge anti-Soviet leaders in the Balkans has now expanded to Bulgaria. According to the British Foreign Office, the Soviet Union has refused to provide evidence regarding the rumored anti-democratic conspiracy in Hungary. The Bulgarian government, controlled by the Communist Party, has arrested Petkov, the leader of the National United Farmers' Party, who has been the most vocal in criticizing the Soviet Union. According to well-informed sources in Bulgaria, Petkov's arrest is a prelude to cracking down on the anti-communist movement in Bulgaria.

[United Press, London, 5th] Moscow Radio on the 5th summarized the words of Bulgarian Prime Minister Dimitrov, accusing U.S. President Truman of instigating an anti-democratic and fascist trend. It is claimed that when Dimitrov met with Fischer, a reporter from London's "Daily Mail," Fischer asked him for his opinion on Truman's recent speech on the Balkans. Dimitrov replied, "Although I respect the president of this great country, I must solemnly state that, in my opinion, the U.S. president's current speech is encouraging anti-democratic elements and the resurgence of fascist regimes. Therefore, I cannot believe that this speech contributes to peace and democracy. I do not believe that this speech helps to eliminate the mutual distrust that exists between some countries in the Balkans or helps to establish peace and security in the Balkans."

### U.S. Transfers Control of Occupied Areas to Civilian Administration; State Department and Army Department Prepare to Discuss

[United Press, Washington, 6th] According to what United Press has learned today, the U.S. Secretary of the Army and the Secretary of State have abused the power of their respective departments and begun preparing to transfer the occupied areas under the administration of American soldiers in Europe and the Pacific to civilian administration. Marshall and Patterson have exchanged letters, agreeing to engage in preliminary discussions. This change does not mean that the Army will withdraw from the occupied areas, but rather that the Army will transfer the political tasks in Germany, England, Japan, and Korea to experts from the State Department, while only undertaking preparatory tasks to maintain order. The State Department has organized several committees to visit the Army Department next week in order to learn as much information as possible about the occupied areas. The Army Department's attempt to transfer the rule of the occupied areas to the State Department has been delayed for a long time due to the opposition of former Secretary of State Byrnes. However, after Marshall became Secretary of State, the State Department's policy changed. Marshall himself first proposed this transfer suggestion when he was Chief of Staff. The Army believes that its task is to fight wars, not to undertake the administrative affairs of occupying countries. The State Department's personnel will investigate this issue, such as supply personnel, budgets, policy decisions, transportation, housing, education, and ideological transformation plans. Subsequently, the State Department will discuss the actual methods and plans for taking over with the Army Department. The responsibility for managing all matters in the occupied areas will be borne by Assistant Secretary of State Hilldring. He has requested retirement several times, but each time Marshall has ordered him to remain in office. If Hilldring resigns, the administrative authorities believe that he will be succeeded by General Clay, the current Army commander in the European occupied area.

### Britain to Transfer Jurisdiction of the Turtle Islands to the Philippines

### Rumors that Vyshinsky Arrived in Czechoslovakia to Strengthen Communist Forces in Czech Territory

(2) Rule by the Communist Party alone. (3) Organize a general labor union to bring all labor unions in the country under the control of Berlin.

[Reported by this newspaper] The Cotton Textile Industry Association of the six districts of this city convened a general meeting of members yesterday to discuss the issue of wage payments after the cost-of-living index was unfrozen. They unanimously agreed that the increase in the index has greatly affected production costs.

Protecting the livelihood of the workers themselves is also the top priority. Therefore, it is planned to negotiate with the labor union to extend working hours under reasonable circumstances. Wages for June will still be paid according to the May index, and wages for July will be paid according to the June index, sequentially delaying by one month to reduce the May payroll, which has mostly been paid at 22,500 times.

### Increased Costs Due to Unfreezing of the Index: Representatives of Several Trade Associations Petition

It was decided to send representatives to petition the municipal government at 10:30 AM this morning.

During the meeting, both sides argued strongly. The labor side stated that if the capital side was unable to bear the cost, they could seek an agreement directly with the workers, and the Trade Association should not notify each factory to generally disburse according to 14,800 times the rate, as this would violate government regulations. The Trade Association representative stated that the notification to each factory was not a mandatory regulation. Finally, under the mediation of Director Zhao, principles were agreed upon. All workers' wages should be disbursed according to each factory's economic capacity, and adjustments would be made after a thorough resolution.

(2) For the second half of May wages, the government-announced index of 23,500 times will not be discounted for the time being and will be issued from today.

(4) Hereafter, wage issuance will be regulated to issue wages for the first half of each month according to the index of the previous month. (5) Factories that suspend work starting from the second half of each month must not delay the wages for the first half of the month and must be issued on schedule.

### Nine More Major Criminals Apprehended in the Sima Road Murder Case: They Confess to Taking the Association's Funds Without Permission and Seeking Revenge

[Reported by this newspaper] In the murder case that occurred in front of the Atlantic Western Restaurant on Sima Road late at night on the 1st of this month, the victim, Chou Lianhuan, was struck by four axes. He was sent to the hospital but died due to his injuries. After the incident, in addition to apprehending Hang Yinquan, who committed the crime on the spot and was shot by Chou, the Laozha Police Branch also arrested Mao Qingyu, who was responsible for keeping watch, at No. 20 Changshou Lane, Changan Road, overnight with the Detective Section of the General Bureau. After investigation, he confessed that the masterminds behind the scenes were Lu Wenying, Xue Fuyuan, Feng Renyi, Sheng Shugen, Bai Laili, Li Bin, and others. However, Lu Wenying and Xue Fuyuan have been defended by their wives in the newspapers, proving that they were not involved in the case. The remaining criminals, as well as Ye Dongying (nicknamed Hercules), Wei Xiaoyang, and others who committed the crime on the spot, were assigned by Zheng Junhou, Chief of the Detective Section of the Police Bureau, to Zhu Mengqi, the section chief, along with staff members Chen Xianrong, Gan Yuanma Feimu, Ding Wenyang, Wu Yaozu, and Liu Qingliang, to investigate and bring them back for interrogation as soon as possible.

At the same time, the Sixth Inspection Brigade of the Garrison Command was also ordered by Captain Qi Zaiwang to assign a large number of staff members to assist in the pursuit. As of yesterday, Sheng Shugen, Wei Xiaoyang, Ye Dongying, Li Desheng, Ma Caide, Chai Liangjiang, Wu Xiaomao, Chu Shurong, and Ye Dongying's mistress, Wang Aixiang, have been apprehended one after another. According to preliminary investigations, it was learned that the case was caused by a person named Chuan Qifu (nicknamed Little Ghost Afu), who recently won an association fund of 1.8 million yuan. Chou took the funds without Chuan's consent, and after negotiating with him, nothing came of it, and he held a grudge. At the same time, Chou had feuds with Chuan's friends Zhang Xingbao (who had been assassinated), Feng Renyi, Li Bin, Sheng Shugen, Bai Laili, etc. Therefore, after consultation, they decided to use

force for revenge.

Feng and others then hired hitmen Ye Dongying, Wei Xiaoyang, Ma Caide, and others, waiting until the night of the 1st, knowing that Chou was attending a friend's banquet at the Atlantic Western Restaurant. Ma Caide then notified each hitman by telephone at 10:30 PM in the Jincheng Billiard Hall on Sima Road to gather in front of the Tianchan Theater. Waiting until 11:45 PM, they saw Chou walking out of the Atlantic. They rushed forward, originally intending to "touch Chou Lianhuan's bad luck" and "borrow a foot for use", so Ye Dongying chopped his left leg with an axe. Unexpectedly, Chou immediately pulled out a self-defense pistol and fired two shots at Hang Yinquan, one of which hit Hang, and the other injured a prostitute named Lu Peihua. At this point, Wei Xiaoyang and others chopped his two wrists and the back of his head three more times, eventually causing him to

fall to the ground due to serious injuries.

They dispersed, but the details are still being investigated by the police. It is reported that Chou had many disciples, most of whom were performing comic dramas. Xiao Kuaile, who was attacked by rice merchants for the rice weevil incident last month, was also one of his proud disciples. Therefore, after Chou's death, Xiao broadcast "Crying for Chou Lianhuan" on the radio to repay his teacher's kindness. As for the arrest locations of each criminal, they included No. 53 Xianmianci Lane, Penglai Road, Nanshi; No. 10 Yinggongci Lane, Nanshi; near the Xiaoduhui Dance Hall on Nanjing West Road; and Longhua. However, the main criminals Feng Renyi, Bai Laili, Li Bin, and Fu Qifu are still at large.

### Rabid Dogs Rampant in Hongqiao: One Person Dies

### Corruption Case in the Municipal Government Cooperative: The Appeal is Concluded and Sentenced; Li Jiancheng Sentenced to Seven Years, Zhu Zhiqin Lightly Sentenced

[Reported by this newspaper] Li Jiancheng, former Commissioner of the Municipal Government and Manager of the Employee Consumer Cooperative, and Zhu Zhiqin, the accountant of the cooperative, were sentenced by the District Court to five years of imprisonment for Li and two years of imprisonment for Zhu for committing corruption. Both defendants refused to accept the sentence and appealed to the High Court, which remanded the case for retrial. Zhu Yu, Judge of the First Criminal Court of the District Court, announced the verdict yesterday: "Li Jiancheng, for directly seeking profits from matters under his jurisdiction, is sentenced to seven years of imprisonment and deprivation of public rights for eight years. Zhu Zhiqin, for assisting in directly seeking profits from matters under his jurisdiction, is sentenced to one year and nine months of imprisonment and deprivation of public rights for two years." The reasons for the judgment were that the defendant Li Jiancheng had successively withdrawn 14,287,888 yuan from the cooperative in the name of temporary business expenses, claiming that the previous funds were used to purchase a car for the use of the cooperative as proof. Also, the defendant's defense that the manager of the cooperative was not a civil servant and could not constitute the crime of corruption was also not accepted. As for the defendant Zhu Zhiqin, who served as the accountant of the cooperative, she repeatedly prepared and paid the above-mentioned funds for the continuous use of the defendant Li Jiancheng without any receipt vouchers, and falsely reported the statement of receipts and expenditures sent to the Shanghai City Bank as being used for the purchase of trucks and thermos bottles, which should also constitute the crime of assisting corruption. However, because the defendant was under the supervision of Li, the circumstances of the crime were particularly pitiful, so she was given a light sentence.

### Schools Should Continue Classes as Usual, Students Should Focus on Their Studies, Appeal from Overseas Chinese in Penang

[Penang, 6th Dispatch] To the Shanghai Shenbao and All Compatriots in the Country: Recent student unrest in the motherland has caused social disorder, which is deeply distressing to overseas Chinese. It is understandable that students are concerned about national affairs, but at this time, discussing national affairs must involve distinguishing right from wrong so as not to be taken advantage of. It is also important to understand that peace is a matter for both sides. Merely striking and marching, or even rioting, to threaten one side will only increase the arrogance of the other side and increase the difficulty of peace. Overseas Chinese sincerely hope that people from all walks of life in the country will uphold justice, persuade students to return to the right path, and hope that the government authorities will quickly adopt wise measures to maintain order so that schools can continue classes as usual and students can focus on their studies. The future of the country will be fortunate. Respectfully submitted by Penang Reading Newspaper Society and all societies and schools.

### Minister of Economic Affairs Chen Qitian Arrives in Shanghai to Inspect Various Agencies of the Ministry; Government Economic Policies Still Need Considerable Restrictions

[Our Newspaper's Report] Minister of Economic Affairs Chen Qitian arrived in Shanghai the previous day, taking an overnight train from Nanjing, and arrived here at approximately 7:00 AM yesterday. This newspaper's reporter made a special trip to interview him and was received. He said: The main task of this trip to Shanghai is to inspect the work of various affiliated agencies of the Ministry of Economic Affairs in Shanghai. He roughly plans to stay in Shanghai for four days and return to Nanjing on the evening train next Monday.

The reporter then raised several questions, and he answered them to the best of his knowledge. The main points are recorded as follows:

(1) Regarding the government's economic policies, in the past, emphasis was placed on control, but since the reorganization of the government, it has been moving towards a free economy. However, he stated that due to the current situation, the free economic policy must still be subject to considerable restrictions in order to take the facts into consideration.

(2) Regarding the Textile Industry Adjustment Committee, which is being established, he met with Zou Bingwen, who will be the chairman of the committee, yesterday to discuss the future affairs of the committee and jointly plan its promotion, so that the committee can be established as soon as possible to take over the affairs of the current Textile Industry Management Committee. Although the designated chairman of the committee, Zou Bingwen, has not yet taken office, he has been doing his best to persuade him to accept the new position, and there should be no problem.

(3) Regarding the original regulations of the Textile Industry Management Committee on the control of yarn shipped to Hankou, the possibility of cancellation can be considered. Detailed methods will be announced after the Textile Industry Adjustment Committee is established.

(4) Regarding the Shanghai Fuel Management Committee, he summoned the person in charge of the committee yesterday to inquire about the current work situation in detail. Regarding the current coal supply problem, he instructed the committee to find ways to dredge the coal source and keep transportation uninterrupted. Protecting mines and roads should be planned and considered together so that the coal supply can be continuously replenished. At the same time, the government is currently entrusting the Central Trust Bureau to order 50,000 tons of foreign coal from Canada to increase the coal supply.

(5) Regarding the adjustment of coal prices: the government has now decided that the government will continue to be responsible for subsidizing the coal used by railways and public utilities. As for general factories and civilian coal, the price is calculated based on the cost of coal plus transportation costs to maintain the profitability of the mines.

(6) Regarding the management of the dismantling and transfer of Japanese industrial equipment in our country: He estimated that the total construction cost would be over 100 billion national currency.

(7) Regarding the US loan to our country, he said that the opinion circles have been quite optimistic recently, and based on his personal feelings, he also believes that there is a strong hope. As for the amount, it remains to be decided by the United States.

(8) He is scheduled to meet with Mayor Wu of the Municipal Government at 9:00 AM this morning and will also meet with Li Shuyun, the general manager of the China Textile Construction Company. This afternoon, he will observe the various factories under the China Textile Construction Company. At 9:00 AM tomorrow morning, he will convene a meeting of the heads of various affiliated agencies of the Ministry of Economic Affairs in Shanghai at the Industry and Commerce Counseling Office. The attending institutions will include the Textile Industry Management Committee, the Fuel Management Committee, and the Commodity Inspection Bureau.

### Money Market Suddenly Tightens Again; Yong Yarn Declines All the Way; Small Stocks Show Slight Stability

Yesterday, the Chinese stock market suddenly tightened again, and the bulls in the industry suddenly collapsed. A 30% margin deposit generally required cash. Outsiders hesitated to move forward, and transactions were extremely sparse. There were many cracks in the environment. Although small stocks were still peaceful, Yong yarn formed a one-sided downward trend, gradually declining. Match and Commercial also reported a limit down. The future will still tend to be volatile.

The morning opening was quite stable due to the huge difference in the closing price of the previous day's National Bank. All stocks opened higher. After the opening of the successive Yong yarns, Nos. 27 and 186 advanced, once rising to 6820 yuan. Nos. 190, 117, 154, 133, 223, 231, 76, 31, 102, 155, and 89 were sold off and gradually went downstream, retreating to 6630 yuan. Nos. 14, 224, 97, 197, and 76 took advantage of the low to maintain, rising to over 6800 yuan. Nos. 91, 36, and 28 sold to within 6700 yuan. Nos. 105 and 235 slightly accepted and fluctuated slightly. Nos. 89, 180, 155, 105, 24, 203, and 32 sold more eagerly. It was heard that the money market was extremely tight; unfavorable news came from the Central Road, and delivery was extremely difficult. People's hearts could not bear it and it fell to within 6400 yuan. Around 11:00, the market price formed a seesaw within 6400 yuan. Before long, No. 32 added to the sell-off, and Nos. 180, 47, 137, and 44 sold to 6200 yuan. No. 129 also went out after entering, and the report went downstream again. Nos. 31, 226, 32, 224, 129, 148, and 223 sold one after another. The Hong Kong-Shanghai telegram shrank to 14.2 yuan and continued to go downstream. The successive Yong yarn fell to 6050 yuan. Now, Yong yarn also saw a low price of 5870 yuan. Match fell to the limit by No. 224, and Commercial fell to the limit by No. 112. Nos. 186, 177, 91, 185, and 224 came to accept, and the noon closing rose to 6170 yuan. The recovery shouting price was flat. As a result, compared with the previous closing, the spot stocks Yong yarn, Yonggong, Huafeng, Qinxing, Sino-French, and Xinhua each fell by about half a percent. Xinhe and Xinguang slightly fell. Jingfu slightly rose. Match and Commercial fell to the limit. Lian'an underwear, China Silk, and Rongfeng fell by about 10%. Xinya Guohuo, Jinglun, and Datong were still flat. Tongyi and China Textile fell by half a percent. Among the successively delivered stocks, Yong yarn, Yonggong, Huafeng, and Xinhe each fell by half a percent. Xinguang and Jingfu slightly fell. Qinxing fell by slightly less than 10%. In the off-market, each old service, including Dasheng No. 3 Factory, had less buying than selling, and fell by another half a percent. The remaining stocks had slight rises and falls.

### Five Types of Government Bonds to Be Drawn for Principal Repayment on a Regular Basis

Five types of government bonds, including the 25th Year of the Republic of China Unified Government Bonds, Series E Bonds, the 27th Year Relief Bonds, the 30th Year Construction Bonds, Second Series Bonds, the 31st Year Allied Victory Bonds, and the 33rd Year Allied Victory Bonds, will be drawn for principal repayment publicly in Shanghai on June 11, as determined by the Ministry of Finance.

### China Textile Construction Company's Export Yarn and Cloth

The Annual Quantity is Expected to Increase

[Our Newspaper's Report] The China Textile Construction Company has decided in principle to handle the export of yarn and cloth as one-tenth of the company's output. According to Deputy General Manager Wu of the company, who spoke to reporters: The company's cotton yarn production this year can generally increase to more than 800,000 pieces. Exporting one-tenth of this number, the total annual export volume will reach 40,000 pieces of yarn and about 1.3 million bolts of cloth. Calculating each piece of yarn at US$300 and each bolt of cloth at US$12, the foreign exchange earned from the annual export of yarn and cloth will reach US$27.6 million.

### Yarn and Cloth are Both Weak

Yesterday, the yarn market opened initially, and the market was still firm and high. Later, the market sentiment turned discouraged due to the sale of yarn by the China Textile Construction Company, and the price did not change much. Many floating households dispersed, which led to new selling, and the price fell. As a result, 42-count Blue Phoenix fell to a closing price of 12.9 million yuan, a decrease of 70,000 yuan compared to the previous day's closing. Throughout the day, the market for 20-count and 16-count yarns was mixed, while 32-count and 42-count various brands of fine yarn fell slightly from 50,000 to 120,000 yuan.

In the cotton cloth market, the morning opening was driven by the news that the Hankou transportation and sales control would be lifted. People's hearts were excited, and sporadic absorption was not weak. The market trend was bullish. Unexpectedly, by the time of closing, the price of yarn fell, and many dispersed investors rushed to sell off, and the market turned weak. As a result, the Four Gentlemen, Golden Seal, Drill, and Twill, from Jiangxi gang saw low absorption, bleached cloth, poplin, and Broadcloth were replenished in the street, and the market was still firm. The remaining fine cloth and fine twill were all weak.

### Arrivals are Few and Inventories are Depleted; Autumn and Winter Woolens are Selling Well

Summer woolen goods have chaotic standards. Those with strength and door shops still mostly hold firm and refuse to sell cheaply. Conversely, they are willing to cut prices to sell off. Therefore, the transaction prices at tea parties often differ. Deep-colored woolens for autumn and winter demand, Chinese and Western suit fancy woolens, serge, valencia, melton overcoat woolens, etc., were all traded yesterday. Those with remaining strength from the local gang successively searched for goods. Because fine wool, glossy wool, and serge that are transported in and produced and stored are increasingly scarce, it is expected that prices will rise again in the autumn.

### US Dollar Bonds; Various Trade Associations to Conclude Fundraising Sales Within Four Weeks

[Our Newspaper's Report] Regarding the bond fundraising and sales matters of various trade associations, it is heard that the US Dollar Bond Fundraising and Sales Committee will convene various trade associations again for discussions starting next week. It is generally determined to conclude the fundraising and sales matters of various trade associations within four weeks. As for the bonds subscribed by the Six-District Cotton Spinning Association, the Central Trust Bureau has signed a contract with the association, in which the association's factories provide a certain amount of cotton yarn and request the assistance of the China Textile Construction Company to provide a certain amount of cotton yarn for the Central Trust Bureau to export. The foreign exchange obtained will be used to purchase bond funds.

### Foreign Exchange Settlement Method for Second Quarter Foreign Cotton Imports Determined by the National Bank; Purchasing Allowed Based on Foreign Cotton Allocation Certificate

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Central Bank issued Circular No. 101 yesterday to designated banks regarding the application for foreign exchange settlement for foreign cotton import quotas for May to July of this year. The content is recorded as follows:

"Regarding the import quotas for cotton for the second quarter of this year (May to July) approved by the Import Restriction Distribution Office of the Provisional Management Committee, a method has been negotiated with the Central Bank, and the New York Citibank China Bank New York Branch and the New York Chase Bank will provide financial accommodation. The entrustment purchase certificates for the foreign cotton can be opened at the Shanghai Citibank and the Foreign Department of the Bank of China, and designated banks should notify the yarn factories accordingly. The procedures to be followed can be compared to the provisions of this Bank's previously announced Circular No. 95.

The Import Quota Allocation Office, in view of the urgent need to ship the US cotton quota with export subsidies, has considered canceling the previous regulation that yarn factories must hold an import license before they can open an entrustment purchase certificate. For this US cotton, designated banks may change to opening an entrustment purchase certificate based on the Foreign Cotton Allocation Certificate issued by the Foreign Cotton Allocation Committee. The amount should not exceed what is necessary for the quantity of cotton to be ordered as specified in the Allocation Certificate. What the designated banks must pay special attention to is that this Foreign Cotton Allocation Certificate only specifies the quantity of foreign cotton approved for ordering, so it is necessary to carefully check the amount of foreign exchange applied for in the entrustment purchase certificate (excluding expenses such as deferred delivery and losses).

Once the import license is issued, each designated bank must still record the detailed records of foreign exchange settlement and sales on the back of the license as usual."

### Rice Arrivals Increase, Prices Fall

[Our Newspaper's Report] The source of rice in the market has suddenly become smooth. Many ships from Songqing gang arrived yesterday, and many goods also came from Suxi Chang and were being unloaded. Although the market registration was only more than 5,000 piculs, the actual arrivals were more than 10,000 piculs. Because the market saw a smooth flow of goods, the market atmosphere softened, people's hearts hesitated, and most people waited and watched without moving forward. Transactions were scarce, and all goods fell uniformly. High-quality white japonica rice returned to 425,000 yuan, a drop of 120,000 yuan.

Flour digestion was idle and scattered. New wheat has been seen, and people's hearts are weak, returning low by 12,000 yuan. Bran rural sales were moving but not prosperous, and the situation became stagnant. Soybean cake customers were accompanying the purchase. It was firm in the morning and light in the afternoon, and the shape tended to soften. Soybean oil factories adopted it. Both Hankou Zha beans and Northeastern soybeans turned up by a thousand yuan, while Du soybeans were still flat. Red beans were sluggish and fell by 35,000 yuan. Kidney beans gradually decreased, falling another 35,000 yuan.

Red sorghum removal was moving but not prosperous, and continued to fall by 35,000 yuan. Corn from Beiyang did not move and continued to decrease by 35,000 yuan. Sesame foreign merchants were active and rose by 10,000 yuan. Raw peanuts stood out, Chen wheat stood firm, the source of new wheat has not yet been prosperous, and there are no rises and falls for the time being. New broad beans high-quality goods are diverted and moved slightly, the price shape is temporarily flat, but the lower grades are still seeing a small drop. New Yuan wheat failed because the goods were of poor quality, and it was difficult to find customers, falling by 35,000 yuan. The oil market stores were still okay, and continued to rise by 10,000 yuan, turning light at noon, with little volatility.

Another report: Miscellaneous grains from Sichuan Province are gradually moving east. If corn raw peanuts and green beans have successively arrived in Shanghai, alcohol has also arrived in Shanghai, and the price of Sichuan rice is low. Merchants are planning to go to purchase. The Rice Industry Association has a certificate to handle the transportation of Sichuan rice to Shanghai by merchants.

### Soviet Union Plans to Purchase Chinese Black Tea in Hong Kong

Central News Agency, Hong Kong, 6th: It is reported that the Soviet commercial representative in Hong Kong recently negotiated with local tea merchants to purchase 1,000 piculs of Chinese black tea. General observers believe that the biggest factor in the Soviet Union's attention to the Hong Kong market is that China's official foreign exchange rate is too high. Recently, the tea market here has been depressed, and Chinese black tea has fallen from US$160 per picul to US$80 per picul.

### Buyer's Hopes Become Illusions Again; Unified Bond Decline is Very Severe; External Stocks Have Poor Environment and Also Decline

The bond market collapsed yesterday because the proposal to repay the conference by a multiple of the reported number was rejected, and Minister Yu made a strong statement. The buyer's hopes became illusions again. Unified Series C opened in the morning and fell to 9,500 yuan, as low as 7,500 yuan. Then it rose to around 8,300 yuan to end. Baolong and many scattered investors cut up to 503 rooms and there were compensations. Under a turnover of more than 6 million, compared with the previous closing, Series A, B, and D fell by 3,400, Unified Series C fell by 4,800, and Unified Series E also fell by 3,700.

External stocks were sold yesterday due to securities gang and retail inventory resales, and the environment was pessimistic. Although the Hong Kong-Shanghai telegram reported a shrinkage to 14.2 yuan, it did not help the overall situation. Jardine Spinning fell from an initial 65,500 yuan in the morning to the 60,000 yuan border and then leveled off slightly. As a result, compared with the previous closing, British Airways and Jardine Beer each fell by half a percent, and Jardine Spinning Steel fell by about 10%. The remaining stocks all declined slightly.

### Textile Industry Management Committee Approves the Amount of Yarn and Cloth Transported North and South

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Textile Industry Management Committee announced yesterday the review process of yarn and cloth manufacturers transported to the north as follows: (1) 133 factories applied for registration and passed the review. (2) 256 distributors applied for registration and passed the review. (3) 156 factories registered to transport south have passed and have received registration cards. (4) 100 manufacturers applied for registration and failed the review. The committee has scheduled to notify the manufacturers on the 9th. After receiving the notification, the approved manufacturers must bring their original seals to the committee within three days to collect their registration cards. After the registration card procedures are completed, the committee will separately notify the manufacturers of the quota of yarn and cloth transported to the north this month. It is expected that applications for yarn and cloth transported to the north can be accepted starting on the 16th of this month.

The committee will notify the southern transportation manufacturers of the numbers today. Applications for yarn and cloth transported south can be accepted starting on the 11th of this month.

### Tea Sales are Active

The foreign tea market saw gradually active transactions yesterday, but there was no change in prices. As for the domestic sales of red and green tea, they continued to be smooth, and especially slightly baked, pearl cocoon, and other green teas were sold more smoothly. However, the market trend was affected by the goods, and there were varying degrees of rises and falls compared to the previous day. It is learned that recently the Tianjin gang has suddenly paid attention to green tea core, and it is heard that they are willing to accept any price at 35,000 to 36,000 yuan per picul. However, the goods side is reluctant to part with it at this low price, so whether or not the transaction will be completed is still being brewed.

### Cigarette Market is Still Weak

Yesterday, the cigarette market atmosphere was deserted because foreign peers were reselling, and the people in the market were idle. Wholesale transactions were very rare, and there were only sporadic supplements. At the morning opening, ten Great British marriages were 6.4 million yuan. Afterwards, they gradually fell. The afternoon was even more sluggish. It was also heard that many Qalique cigarettes were brought in from Hong Kong, and sellers were active. Finally, the price of ten Great British marriages was as low as 6.265 million yuan, a further drop of 155,000 yuan compared to the previous day, Old Knife dropped by 30,000 yuan, Wu Hua dropped by 60,000 yuan, and Hader gate dropped by 90,000 yuan. Throughout the day, the paper cigarettes and tinned cigarettes of various Chinese and foreign factories fell uniformly. Only Jin Mao and Great Kraiss Axes and other two or three brands had a harder footing.

### Passenger and Freight Rates of Shipping Industry Increased by Different Percentages

The Shanghai Shipping Industry Association previously sent personnel to Nanjing to request the cancellation of subsidies and the implementation of industry-agreed price methods. Starting this month, passenger and freight rates on each line will be adjusted. It is learned that the Ministry of Communications has agreed in principle to the industry's request. The association convened a rate committee the day before yesterday to formulate the price increase standards and asked the joint meeting of directors and supervisors to decide yesterday afternoon to submit the proposed adjusted prices to the Ministry of Communications for approval. It is learned that the passenger and freight rates that the industry has requested to be adjusted are divided into four types: North and South Ocean Lines, Shanghai-Ningbo Line, Yangtze River Line, and Opposite River Line. The percentage increase is not uniform, with North and South Ocean Lines increasing by 150%, followed by Shanghai-Rain Line and Yangtze River Line, and Opposite River Line increasing by 100%. As for the adjustment date, the industry hopes to implement it before the middle of the month.

### 1,700 Tons of Frozen Eggs; First Batch Shipped to England Yesterday

Spring and summer, namely the four months of March, April, May, and June, are the peak season for egg production in various rural areas of our country. When foreign exchange was adjusted this year, the UK ordered 5,000 tons of frozen eggs from us. Exporters refused to sign the contract because the price was not right. Later, the Central Trust Bureau agreed to assist in exports, and both parties reached a solution. The Central Trust Bureau purchased them at a price of 9 million per ton and then transported them to the UK. Yesterday, the Central Trust Bureau assisted egg merchants in transporting 1,700 tons. There are still 3,300 tons left, and the egg merchants have once again expressed their unwillingness to sell because the cost has risen by 80% compared to before. If they are purchased at the old price, the losses will be enormous. The Central Trust Bureau is currently considering increasing the purchase price to maintain the contract.

### The Medical World's Infatuation with Skeletons

— Wen Si

On May 10th, when I attended the closing ceremony of the Chinese Medical Association's conference, an old friend sitting behind me suddenly handed me a clipping. I didn't bother to read it closely at the time, and just casually put it in my pocket, because articles of the "Dedicated to the Medical Association" type were very numerous during the conference, and none stood out particularly. A few days after the conference, I re-read this clipping, and it was like a bolt out of the blue, leaving me stunned!

That "traditional Chinese medicine" is unscientific and anti-scientific is an undeniable fact. Yet, there are still people who say it is a "cultural heritage," believing that "this kind of medicine is not entirely without value; it cures many diseases, it has many good raw or unrefined remedies, it uses the Five Elements theory to explain physiological phenomena, and bases its diagnoses on pulse taking to prescribe medicine, often with accurate results," openly arguing its "unscientific" and "anti-scientific" nature! Moreover, they say, "No papers analyzing the Five Elements physiological phenomenon theory have been seen, which Zhu Mian finds regrettable!"

Frankly speaking, in this modern era and society, the appearance of such arguments can indeed be considered regrettable. Twenty years ago, while articles criticizing traditional medicine as unscientific and anti-scientific weren't exactly abundant enough to fill carts, they weren't entirely absent either. Mr. Yu Yunxiu's "Collection of Essays on Medical Revolution" and "Ling Shu Wen Dui" are among the most systematic and comprehensive works. Mr. Chen Fangzhi also wrote many critiques of traditional medicine, and both of these scientific doctors are still alive and well. The Tianjin Dagongbao Medical Weekly before the war also frequently featured critiques of traditional medicine a decade or so ago. These old books and newspapers are naturally not to be found on today's book stalls. Those born later who wish to see these things will have to search in historical libraries, such as the National Peiping Library. It is evident that the "negation of the value of traditional medicine" by scientific medical researchers was established decades ago!

Native innovation should not be discussed in the same breath as metaphysical traditional medicine. In the era of uncivilized humanity, there was only magical, mystical witch doctoring. Magic is easily exposed and insufficient to deceive the knowledgeable, so there was a stage of metaphysics. It was not until the development of science that medicine entered the correct path of science, demanding evidence and emphasizing experimentation. Metaphysical medicine is a stage in the development history of medicine, and this is true for every nation. The Five Elements are not a unique product of the Republic of China; India has four elements, and the West also has four humors. Their medicine fifty years ago was full of this kind of metaphysics, and even today, there are still many remnants. There are many who dream of excavating some "gems" from traditional Chinese medicine, and a few are still working hard at it. However, given the extreme shortage of medical talent in China, and the need for people to do many important tasks, most experienced individuals do not advocate for accomplished medical professionals to engage in this kind of non-urgent task. The reason why there is such a demand in society is because people are deceived by the fact that traditional medicine "cures many diseases." The so-called "cure" is in reality "taking credit belonging to heaven."

The value of traditional medicine has long been determined. Our eastern neighbor, while foolishly militaristic, is undeniably much smarter than the Chinese in its understanding of science. The development of scientific medicine is comparable to that of the West. They determined the value of Huang Han medicine earlier than China and took decisive action. Therefore, there is no longer any dispute between new and old medicine in Japan. Even in Taiwan, in the early days of falling into enemy hands more than forty years ago, they used a one-time registration of old doctors, followed by a permanent cessation of registration, to eliminate it over time. Is it difficult to say that the Japanese are less scientific and lack scientific spirit than us?

Now, in the mid-20th century, when science is so advanced that humanity can utilize atomic energy, Chinese scholars are still treating the outdated traditional medicine of the metaphysical era as a classic. It is truly like an stubborn antiquarian being infatuated with skeletons!

### The Evil Consequences Caused by Tonsillitis in Children

— Yang Shida

The tonsils, commonly known as "milk moths," are two peach-kernel-sized glands located on either side of the fauces, one on each side. Children are particularly prone to this condition during the autumn and winter seasons when the weather changes. The pediatric outpatient department of the Municipal Fourth Hospital diagnosed a total of 1,771 people in November and December, of whom 99 children had tonsillitis, accounting for more than 5%. This number naturally only includes a small portion, as most children with tonsillitis seek treatment from the Department of Otolaryngology due to throat pain. This report tells us that tonsillitis is a disease that cannot be ignored in children, and it can cause many evil consequences. Many parents are skeptical of recommendations for tonsillectomy and do not accept it, leading to the successive occurrence of complications and even death, which is not unexpected. Now, the symptoms of tonsillitis and the evil consequences it can cause are written below for the reference of parents of children with tonsillitis.

Symptoms of Tonsillitis

Children who often suffer from tonsillitis are mostly physically weak. During seasons of changing weather, they suddenly show discomfort, high fever, headache, fatigue, and indigestion. Infants may also experience convulsions. After this violent prelude, the local symptoms gradually become apparent. The throat feels dry and painful, and swallowing becomes difficult. At this time, examination of the oropharynx reveals that the peach-kernel-shaped tonsils on both sides of the fauces are red and swollen, covered with a layer of mucus, or scattered with a few white spots. The lymph nodes in the angle of the jaw are also affected, with mild swelling and pain. After a few days of appropriate treatment, the redness and swelling of the tonsils will gradually subside, but recurrence is unavoidable. When encountering mild fatigue or exposure to some wind and cold, alarming symptoms will appear again. Thus, these children become regular customers of our pediatricians.

Complications of Tonsillitis

After repeated inflammation, tonsils become a reservoir for various bacteria. Once there is an opportunity, these bacteria will attack the human body. The parts most easily harmed are the organs near the tonsils:

(A) Otitis media and sinusitis: Many children have yellow pus flowing from their ears all year round, which is extremely difficult to cure. Unfortunately, it can also cause meningitis or mastoiditis. In addition, sinusitis (commonly known as brain leakage) is characterized by a constant dripping of foul-smelling pus from the nasal cavity, which is caused by the bacteria hidden in the tonsils spreading into it, causing lesions.

(B) Cervical Lymph Node Abscess: When the lymph nodes in the neck of children with weakened resistance retain too many bacteria after repeated inflammation of the tonsils, they can also suppurate and form sores, which require surgical treatment to heal.

(C) Septicemia: In the most unfortunate cases, the bacteria hidden in the tonsils can invade the bloodstream, causing septicemia (bacteria developing in the blood). In this situation, a few days after the onset of tonsillitis, the general symptoms worsen, the disease turns into a typhoid-like state, the body temperature rises to 39 to 40 degrees Celsius, diarrhea and proteinuria occur, and the disease progresses rapidly, leading to death in a short time. Or, in the process of progression, complications of various organs are found, such as endocarditis, pericarditis, pleurisy, arthritis, nephritis, meningitis, purpura, and nodular erythema. The most common complication of tonsillitis is:

(D) Joint Diseases: This is a common fact in pediatric clinical practice. After children suffer from tonsillitis, various joint diseases follow, including joint pain, joint swelling, and subacute polyarthritis.

(E) Nephritis: Most cases of nephritis in children are caused by tonsillitis. Therefore, the urine of children after illness should be checked frequently. The impact on the kidneys can be very mild, and only a slight degree of proteinuria can be detected to confirm it. However, there are severe damages leading to hematuric nephritis or edematous nephritis, which are generally obvious and cannot be ignored. Proteinuria can also be chronic from the beginning, with proteinuria worsening each time tonsillitis occurs, becoming a lifelong incurable disease. The currently so-called cold nephritis is all caused by tonsillitis, which seems to be an undeniable fact.

Treatment of Tonsillitis

Since tonsillitis can cause dangerous evil consequences, it should be treated promptly at the beginning of the illness to prevent it from turning into a chronic problem. Except for a few special bacteria, such as diphtheria, which requires injection of diphtheria serum, and tonsillitis caused by Vincent's spirochetes, which requires injection of 914, the latest treatment is oral and injectable "penicillin," which is extremely effective. Once the signs of inflammation disappear, tonsillectomy can be performed. Performed by experts, it can be said to be painless and without much danger.

### Hygiene for Pregnant Women and During Confinement

— Jiang Eying

Childbirth is originally a natural phenomenon, not a pathological change. However, because childbirth increases the burden on various parts of the body, hidden problems originally present in the body become apparent and erupt at that time, causing illness. This phenomenon is even more pronounced in first-time mothers. Therefore, conversely, pregnant women should pay more attention to hygiene and physical health than usual. The key points of hygiene that pregnant women should pay attention to are as follows:

(1) Diet: Diet during pregnancy is extremely important. Although special foods are not required, several foods should be eaten less than usual, such as meat. There are several types that should be eaten more, such as milk, cream, and fresh vegetables, which are rich in vitamins. A small number of foods are best avoided, such as sour, spicy, and alcoholic foods. The diet during pregnancy can be said to require simple foods, clean cooking, reduced protein such as large amounts of fish and meat, increased carbohydrates such as rice and wheat products, sufficient supply of calcium and vitamins, and drinking plenty of water. Meat can only be eaten once a day to save the kidneys' excretion function, and according to modern research, several products of meat have toxic effects during pregnancy.

The amount of carbohydrates should be increased, i.e., more rice or noodles should be eaten, because the fetus needs a large amount of animal starch, which is taken from the mother's body to maintain proper metabolism. The amount of mineral salts such as calcium in the food should be sufficient to meet the needs of the child, especially in the last three months of pregnancy, the pregnant woman herself must also store it for breastfeeding. Teeth often become fragile and decayed, and bone quality softens during pregnancy. Calcium can also prevent toxemia from occurring. Calcium is mostly found in foods such as milk, eggs, and green vegetables. Eating more foods containing vitamins is of great benefit to both the mother and the fetus, so it is best for pregnant women to take calcium tablets and cod liver oil.

(2) Physical Exercise: Must be done every day. Encourage pregnant women to continue their usual household chores and social activities. Walking is beneficial in all stages of pregnancy, but strenuous exercise and competitions should be stopped. If exercise is not possible due to some reason, the limbs can be massaged. Strenuous exercise and long-distance car or train travel should be avoided in the first three months of pregnancy to avoid miscarriage. In the last three months, more rest is needed, and it is best to loosen clothing and lie down for an hour after meals, and it is even better if you can fall asleep.

(3) Cleanliness: The body must be clean, and the perineum is especially important. If you cannot take a warm bath every day, the lower part must be washed frequently with soap. Get up early and go to bed early every day, and breathe fresh air.

(4) Clothing: Must be loose to avoid compressing the chest and waist. In the later stages of pregnancy, the uterus moves forward, causing discomfort. Elastic abdominal bands can be used.

(5) Constipation: A common phenomenon throughout pregnancy. Drink more water and eat more fruits. If these simple methods are ineffective, mild laxatives can be used, but strong laxatives should be avoided. In the later stages of pregnancy, the breasts should be washed frequently to prevent the secretory glands from accumulating dirt and promote development.

(6) Dental hygiene is very important. The oral cavity should be checked frequently for cavities and pus. If there are any, see a dentist for treatment. Any purulent lesions during pregnancy are dangerous, as they can be a major route of infection after childbirth.

During pregnancy, a doctor should be consulted frequently for examination to reduce various misfortunes during childbirth. Check the urine for kidney changes to prevent future complications. Is there beriberi? It is also necessary to pay attention at any time. Having leg disease can affect the heart, and because the heart is not good, there is a risk of danger during childbirth. Even if it is not very serious, it will affect the health of the mother and baby after childbirth.

Hygiene During Confinement

The postpartum period is also called the puerperium, commonly referred to as the "month." In the immediate aftermath of childbirth, the general condition of the puerperal woman is nothing more than physical fatigue. Over time, or showing a rather marked post-partum exhaustion, body temperature is a hundred degrees (32 degrees 7.8 degrees) or higher, it can be considered irrelevant, this especially is common in primiparas. Temperature rise is due to muscle-power of the overwork of the reaction, to the second day is completely gone, its heat is rarely over twenty-four hours. Postpartum temperature rise relationship, beginning is not sure, up to twenty-four hours above is a sign of illness, should be examined by a doctor.

In the second and third days after childbirth, the spirit is generally listless, appetite poor, thus only can enter liquid or easily digestible solid food, but women of robust body, or do not show a weakening of digestive power phenomenon, in the first few days, bowel movements are often constipation, you can take a laxative, bowel movements smooth spirit is cheerful. Vaginal cleanliness: Lochia, is from the reproductive tract in the two or three weeks after childbirth, the liquid flows out of the liquid, initially red, then gradually turns pale red and to no liquid. Vaginal cleanliness is the most important thing in the puerperium, because childbirth especially primiparas, cervical, vaginal, vulva and perineum etc. area, often have some kind of tears of the existence, in addition to the discharge of lochia pollution, very easy to wound infection; therefore within a week after delivery, at least twice daily, with one percent lysol or potassium permanganate disinfectant solution etc. wash it, after coated with one percent red mercury, covered with sterile cotton gauze, and after gauze wet, is required to change.

(2) Breast Disposal: Breast milk is the best nutrition for raising children, so unless there are special reasons, the parturient woman must breastfeed herself. This not only on the child's nutritional point of view, that is, on its own reproductive organs recovery function, but also has a very important role in promoting, breast that is to fill expansion, and should begin breast-feeding, before and after breast-feeding, should be three percent boric acid water or warm open forever wipe clean, such as epidermal stripping or small tears, then after breast-feeding coated with boron paste.

(3) Food and drink, our old habits, for the parturient, must be to take alcohol, vinegar, soy and chicken etc., these three things irritating most intensely, often enough to cause the disease, all official fast. As for the chicken, though should in nutrition, but the whole body during confinement no exercise, difficult to digest. To the first two or three days more poor appetite, you can give the milk bread eggs and other easily digestible food, to a week appetite slightly open you can take chicken juice, but irritating should still be forbidden.

(4) Mental State, women during confinement are extremely susceptible to emotional distress, all movements of joy, anger, sorrow and joy, should be avoided, on the bed within the possible range, make bed exercises, namely to arm leg flexion and extension and up and down, and deep breathing, can help digestion, improve the whole body condition, and can correct because of pregnancy when too Zhang's abdominal muscles and help to restore tension.

### Medical Correspondence

— Liang Junqing

Mr. Sifen:

Reading your letter made me very sympathetic to your situation. People all want to live, and those who are sick want to live even more. However, living in this dark society, poor patients simply have no way to seek medical treatment. Although it is said that there are many charitable institutions (such as hospitals and relief centers), most of them are merely superficial decorations, and in fact, they will absolutely not provide benefits to poor patients. To hope that politics can get on the right track, that society can be stable, and that all poor and sick people can receive reasonable treatment, then we can only hope for the "future of the future"! Regarding these issues, they are indeed too complex and cannot be discussed in a short time, nor can they be discussed by us doctors and patients. We can only pull back and discuss what we want to discuss now.

That's right, we are doctors, and we are here to relieve the suffering of patients, but because of the darkness of society, even we feel threatened by the darkness of society. We only need to look at your letter to understand the other corner of the world of medicine. Of course, doctors are also human, and they also need to eat, but the irresponsible attitude and the highly commercial atmosphere not only deter the general patients, but also make us doctors feel very ashamed when we see it. I can anticipate your dissatisfaction with that attitude. And as you said, "In this society, there are too many people like me. And at the same time, it is too difficult for me to obtain the conditions for medical treatment." We often feel that there is a real lack of an institution in society that serves the poor and sick. And our own strength is too weak. Just think about it, your letter was sent on April 28th, and my reply is delayed until now, which is really too late. But I have to tell you that on the one hand, because there are too many letters, and on the other hand, because I am too busy with my own trivial matters, I have to reluctantly delay it. Alas! It's better not to talk about it! We can only do our part and do our own thing. Now let's bring up your questions for discussion!

According to your condition, chronic pulmonary tuberculosis is the most likely. Although the X-ray examination said it was bronchitis, but that doctor advised you to inject vitamin C and glucose calcium, I always thought he was kindly deceiving you, so that you would not be overly frightened by his announcement that you "have tuberculosis", which would affect your entire psychology. However, I have to tell you that having lung disease is not a terminal illness, as long as you can treat it "in time" and find the right treatment. I now hope you go and take an X-ray (taking it at the Sino-American Hospital is cheaper), which may give you a more accurate diagnosis. As for treatment, I think there will always be a way after the diagnosis is made. In addition to the lung aspect, I think you may also have chronic gastritis and stomach prolapse. But maybe there is no real stomach disease, because people with tuberculosis often have stomach symptoms, but in fact the stomach itself does not have any organic lesions.

Afterwards, I must incidentally tell you: We feel that many people who serve in the cultural world have no place to seek medical treatment and are also unable to seek medical treatment, which really has a great impact on the cultural work. Therefore, we are planning to establish a health and welfare association, the purpose of which is to enable everyone who serves in the cultural work to obtain health protection at the lowest cost. Although this work is very difficult, we always hope that it can succeed.

### "Joint Defense Tuberculosis Repelling Agent" — Translation of BCG

— Song Guobin

In the previous issue of this journal, there was an article by Mr. Liu Yongchun on the production of BCG Chinese naming rights. After reading it, I was very interested. Mr. Liu advocates a combination of sound and meaning translation, and I agree very much. Without considering my own ignorance, I intend to translate it with the three characters "Repelling Agent."

Repelling, pronounced bì, similar to the pronunciation of the letter B, has the meaning of avoiding from afar.

Evil, pronounced as Mandarin si, is similar to the letter C. If pronounced as Shanghai pronunciation, it is very different. In ancient times, evil was considered the source of disease, which is actually today's bacteria.

Agent, pronounced as G.

The above three characters are translated with a combination of sound and meaning. Although not very elegant, they do not have the common problem of general proprietary medicine names being seemingly understandable but not understandable. How does a high-minded person think of it?

### The Position of Manual Arts and Fine Arts in National Education

— Hu Shuyi

To discuss the position of manual arts and fine arts in national education, we must first clarify the essence of national education. Since the central government issued the outline for county-level organizations, the Ministry of Education has decided to combine compulsory education with literacy education for out-of-school citizens, renaming it "national education." Its goal, in terms of scope, is to simultaneously establish a universal education movement across the country. This movement should align with political and economic construction, striving towards the national construction goal and catching up. In terms of timing, it should adapt to national conditions and local needs, prescribing procedures to eliminate illiteracy in stages nationwide, ultimately fulfilling the crucial task of education construction. From this, we can determine that national education is an educational construction movement within the current stage of national development. Therefore, the spirit of national education is, first, an education that integrates instruction, nurturing, and hygiene. Second, an education that combines children's practical education with adult remedial education. Third, an education that combines school education with social education. However, these three integrated educational systems are all closely related to the manual arts and fine arts subjects. These are elaborated separately below:

(1) A simple analysis of the educational purpose of manual arts reveals three aspects: First, to train labor skills; second, to cultivate creative abilities; and third, to cultivate an interest in production. We know that previous primary school education only focused on the "teaching" aspect and did not consider the three important tasks of "management," "nurturing," and "hygiene" in local self-governance. The current new system of national education, in addition to educating children and adults, also emphasizes the organization of the populace, the cultivation of production skills, and the training of self-defense capabilities. The cultivation of production skills here is entirely an important goal that manual arts education should achieve. As for labor skills and creative abilities, they are closely related to the organization of the populace and self-defense capabilities. Because organizing the populace and implementing self-defense in local self-governance work require centering around the central national school and national schools, it is essential to cultivate the creative abilities and labor skills of every child, every adult, and every woman, reversing the old bad habits of rote learning and learning uselessly. The aim is to enable children and adults educated by national schools to lead social activities and local enterprises, so that the true spirit of national education, which integrates instruction, nurturing, and hygiene, can be realized. In this light, the position of manual arts in national education is of utmost importance! To realize the true spirit of national education, we must value manual arts education.

(2) Since we acknowledge that national education is locally constructive education, in all processes of local construction, utilizing people's innate love of beauty to complete the beautification of local construction is undeniable. For example, beautified urban planning and beautified rural design are ideals and consistent demands shared by everyone. Therefore, to cultivate every child, adult, and woman, it is first necessary to possess the ability to appreciate and recognize beauty, while also cultivating their expression and creation of beauty. This is an important task to complete constructive national education. This important task relies entirely on fine arts education to achieve. This suggests that fine arts education also occupies a vital position in national education. To realize the true spirit of national education, we must also value fine arts education!

Previous primary school education, with its emphasis on intellectual subjects, did not recognize the true educational goals of manual arts and fine arts, thus classifying these two subjects as skill-based, optional, and inconsequential! Of course, under the erroneous conception of manual arts as handicraft and fine arts as drawing, the importance of manual arts and fine arts education was not recognized. Only by thoroughly understanding the true meaning of manual arts and fine arts education can one realize that the position of manual arts and fine arts in national education is by no means comparable to handicraft and drawing subjects. Furthermore, recent primary education in Britain and the United States highly values the educational value of "work" and "expression," and specially establishes workshops and studios in primary schools. This further proves that manual arts and fine arts subjects do indeed possess objective and unique educational value for foundational national education.

### Franz Cizek

— Wen Zhaotong

Recommended to all art educators of the city's children

If we only acknowledge that every child is a future adult, and do not acknowledge that children have their own personality, then to discuss children's art is to link it with traditional technical training. Therefore, special, creative children's art will not be found in the children's heaven.

An excellent children's art educator should conduct education under the plan of "let children grow, develop, and mature." This recognizes children's personality, and even recognizes children's art.

Franz Cizek (1865-) is someone worthy of our attention in the modern world of education, for dedicating his life to children's art education in accordance with this ideal.

Cizek was Austrian, born in Leitmeritz on the Elbe River in Bohemia. From the age of nineteen, he moved to Vienna. After graduating from Peitmeritz, he entered the Vienna Academy of Fine Arts in 1885 to study, lodging in the home of a carpenter, where he often came into contact with many children who asked him to draw and color. Cizek not only agreed to their requests, but also provided them with a lot of paper, pens, and paints. He discovered the uniqueness of children's paintings and was amazed. He made a firm vow to research and educate in children's art.

He discovered that children's art does not have the same planning as adults, but that clumsy form does return to the art forms of ancient China, Egypt, Babylon, and black people. This is not only a new discovery in art education, but simply a new life of modern art.

Cizek's usual teaching method was to provide abundant references and appreciation items, as well as material resources. When children encountered difficulties in their own production process and came to him for advice, he only gave encouragement, guidance, and hints, and absolutely did not modify or create on their behalf. Because he was the first person to firmly advocate that art teaching should be based on the creative energy of children. Therefore, he is not only a reformer of children's art education, but also an original creator.

### Implementation of Manual Arts and Fine Arts Education

— Jin Qijing

Manual arts and fine arts education is a matter of the entire national culture and is by no means a simple teaching tool. The scope of so-called manual arts and fine arts is also by no means just handicraft and drawing. Its meaning and essence are broad, multifaceted, and organic living education; especially in our Eastern nation, which has always emphasized philosophical thought, it is even more important and urgent!

Everyone knows that children's manual arts achievements are not necessarily really applied, nor are they like vocational schools that make practical utensils. The purpose is to exercise children's muscles and bones, to use children's active nature, and to guide them to practice diligence and enlighten their thoughts. It is the same as the purpose of children's fine arts is not to create painters, but to follow the nature of loving beauty, and to train children's appreciation, expression, and creative interest. Therefore, techniques can be ignored, and there is no need to restrict children's free thoughts. The teaching methods must be carefully studied.

Since the purpose of manual arts and fine arts education is not professional training, all teaching equipment can be simple. Whether in the countryside or in the city, we can make do with what we have. Vast fields and narrow cities are places to implement manual arts and fine arts. Moreover, children may need to apply methods of induction to other knowledge subjects, but only labor and love of beauty are unique talents of children. Guiding children to do manual arts and fine arts is like letting them play in the wild. The question is only how to guide them and assist them? For example, children's art should not be copied, but we should have ideals for children to refer to. Suppose when we implement fine arts, it is exactly the Lunar New Year, and the place is a remote small city, then things like setting off firecrackers and playing with paper dragons are the protagonists of the children. If we use these themes to ask them to create, there will definitely be good results.

In short, the implementation of manual arts and fine arts teaching must not be divorced from life and environment. This is the only important point.

### Hopes for the Exhibition of Manual Arts and Fine Arts Achievements

— Shi Chongpeng

The city-wide children's manual arts and fine arts achievements exhibition, organized by the Municipal Education Bureau, has been in preparation for several months, and has held preliminary exhibitions in various districts. After re-selection by experts, the official exhibition was held simultaneously at the first and second central schools, Tonghui Primary School in the fifth district, and the central school in the third district for three days. All works of more than 20,000 pieces can be said to be magnificent. This is a representative work of the wisdom of 400,000 primary school students in the city, and also the product of the painstaking guidance of more than 1,000 manual arts and fine arts teachers in the city. In such a grand exhibition, in the minds of colleagues who have always been engaged in art education, it is undoubtedly a very interesting thing.

Our colleagues in art education had an organization to promote art education before the war, the Chinese Arts and Education Society. For the promotion of art education activities, we have jointly organized a national children's painting exhibition with the Municipal Education Bureau, the Children's Happiness Society, etc. In terms of design and technology, the Art Education Society has made considerable efforts. At that time, many provinces and cities participated in the works, and a large number of manual arts and fine arts teachers from various provinces and cities came to visit from afar. The impression given to the educational administration authorities, school authorities, art teachers and other parties was quite profound and satisfactory. It was originally intended to be held every year, but unfortunately the War of Resistance broke out, and this plan was suspended.

After the victory, the Art Education Society declared its resumption, but because of financial personnel, no achievements were made, which is very sorry! At the same time, I am also very anxious! We often want to do something that can be done. Therefore, taking advantage of the opportunity of the Education Bureau to organize the manual arts and fine arts exhibition, we consulted with Mr. Shen Yichunqiu and Mr. Wang Jinshan to publish a special issue of the manual arts and fine arts exhibition, and asked several experts to write articles to explain the significance of manual arts and fine arts education, so that everyone will pay attention to it. At the same time, it also expresses congratulations on the success of this children's manual arts and fine arts exhibition.

Many colleagues from the Art Education Society also participated in the preparation work of this manual arts and fine arts exhibition, as well as the re-selection work and the review and evaluation. We have also contributed our spirit and strength, and we should represent all colleagues in the art education circle to pay our sincere gratitude to the educational administration authorities for this very meaningful instruction!

Manual arts and fine arts education has a significant and profound meaning in the entire education. In today's issues, it has been said in great detail. Our hope for the manual arts and fine arts exhibition is: from now on, the school authorities should always pay attention to manual arts and fine arts education, at least to the extent of maintaining the attitude of preparing to participate in the exhibition. Because we know that in order to participate in the manual arts and fine arts exhibition this semester, the school authorities specially selected manual arts and fine arts teachers with a lot of experience, and spent a lot of money to temporarily enrich the teaching equipment in manual arts and fine arts. This is a good phenomenon. We only hope that everyone will pay attention to it regularly. After a long period of time, the effect of manual arts and fine arts education will naturally be expressed.

I also hope that parents will visit the achievements of your children in manual arts and fine arts, and should abandon the attitude of only paying attention to intellectual subjects and despising skill subjects in the past; you should change your vision and recognize that manual arts and fine arts is the best teaching tool for using both hands and brains and following the nature of children, and no longer prevent children's manual arts and fine arts activities. Then, with the serious attention of manual arts and fine arts education in schools and the importance of families, it can be successfully developed!

I also hope that our manual arts and fine arts teachers will pay attention to the mission we bear. How should we design the manual arts and fine arts education that children like? How can we enable children to gain rich and fulfilling life experiences in manual arts and fine arts work? How can we help children express their own thoughts and abilities? Then we can realize the true meaning of manual arts and fine arts education.

### Playing with the Dragon (One of the Achievements of Manual Arts and Fine Arts)

— Chen Guoxiong, 11 years old

### The Creativity of Manual Arts and Fine Arts Education

— Zong Lianghuan

In this Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau-sponsored city-wide primary school manual arts and fine arts achievement exhibition, the preparatory committee and the re-election committee stipulated six selection criteria:

(1) Creativity (2) Authenticity (3) Locality (4) Production significance (5) Scientific significance (6) Educational significance, among which the most important is "creativity".

Why is "creativity" the most important? Because we want to implement child-centered education and life education. We want to let children gain rich life experience, and express their own thoughts and abilities as much as possible; at the same time, we should not just copy the materials prepared by the teacher, so that adults can be satisfied, and consider it to be completed task.

The presentation in manual arts and fine arts subjects is the same as composition, which can allow children to fully express their own opinions. And it must be taught to children in this way often, in order to reach the highest realm. A good composition must be written by the author to express his own views in order to be valuable; if it is all copied, then even if the writing is very vivid, it is not surprising. The achievements of manual arts and fine arts are also the same, and it is most meaningful not to copy other people's works.

We have seen the achievements of the preliminary exhibition of this exhibition. Many schools can pay attention to "creativity", but most of them still use the old method of copying or imitating - some fake achievements are even more unacceptable! Especially in fine arts, seventy-eight out of ten are copied, and the content is mostly adult-centered, which is not suitable for children's needs, so at least half of the achievements are eliminated.

Maybe someone will ask: "Creation is not an easy thing, how can children do it?" That's right! Strict creation is indeed not easy. However, the creation we are talking about is not the creation that scientists or inventors talk about. We are referring to the "educational effect". Dewey regards education as "the continuous reorganization of experience", and the so-called reorganization is the creation in education; Bergson believes that "all life is in constant change, and never maintains the same state and the same form." The so-called transformation is also the creation in education. We make a new thing based on or using old experiences, and this thing is not copied, it is called creation.

How valuable is creation after all? Let's give a few examples to illustrate:

Children A and B each draw a landscape painting. Child A is completely drawn according to the model. The composition, color, and model are similar, and the result is of course good; Child B is sketching a landscape somewhere. The composition and color are only the child's intuitive description, and the technique is not smooth. Of course, his grades are far inferior to those of Child A. But if we look at it from an educational point of view: Child A is just deliberately imitating the model, his mental activity is narrow, passive, and lifeless; Child B has to describe the actual scenery, his mental activity is extensive, automatic and vibrant; its value is of course much higher than imitation. Judging from the technical aspect, Child A is accustomed to plane copying, and the ability to observe and express is certainly not as easy to improve as Child B, so the result must be backward.

For example, children A and B each make a cloth pillowcase. Child A is completely sewn according to the popular style. All the patterns and color schemes are harmonious and beautiful, and the results are of course good. What about Child B? He only has a few simple materials. He has to plan the size, design the decorative pattern, and study the most suitable sewing method. He has to think a lot before making it. Although his achievements are not as perfect as those of Child A in form, the educational value is much higher than that of Child A!

From the above two examples, it can be seen that there is no special difficulty in implementing creative education. It is only necessary for the teacher to find ways to encourage it at any time, give enthusiastic guidance, and do not force children to do adult-centered achievements.

Manual arts and fine arts education should pay attention to "creativity". Not only does education itself have its inevitable reasons, but the social aspect is also very important. All undertakings in our country are not easy to progress; the accumulated habits of "adhering to the old methods" are very deep-rooted. Especially handicrafts, they always lack an original style, so they cannot compete with advanced countries. We want the next generation of workers to be rich in creative aspirations and knowledge, and the education of "creativity" cannot be ignored!

Children's Manual Arts and Fine Arts Achievement Exhibition

### Visiting Mei Lanfang (2)

— Feng Zikai

My love of watching plays started in Sichuan after my exile. For a time, I lived in Fuling, where there was a Ping opera house nearby. I had nothing to do during my exile, so I went to see it every night with my young daughter, Yiyin. At first, I was not interested in the red robe entering and the green robe exiting. Later, I gradually felt that this kind of acting method and acting method came from the same source as the composition method of its music, both of which were exaggerated and symbolic expressions. For example, a red face must be a good person; a white face must be a bad person; a colored face must be a martial person; the female character's walking is like walking a tightrope; the male character's walking is like pulling mud feet... All these acting methods are based on the facts and are extremely exaggerated. The faces of kind and upright people are bright and majestic, and may be exaggerated as red; the faces of treacherous and violent people are cold and gloomy, and may be exaggerated as white; the faces of brave and combative people are rugged, and may be exaggerated as colored. The gait of a slender woman can be exaggerated into a line. The striding steps of a dignified man can be exaggerated like pulling mud feet... Because they are all based on realism, it feels strange at first, and then it will feel natural. As for riding a horse, you only need to take a whip, and opening a door only needs to make a gesture, which not only avoids the disadvantages of being long-winded, but also gives the audience room for imagination. I think this is much more clear than realism.

Since then, I have become a fan of Ping opera; but not an opera fan, just like to listen and watch. My daughters are the opera fans. My eldest daughter Chen Bao, third daughter Ning Xin, and youngest daughter Yiyin are all familiar with singing operas after their public affairs and studies. Among them, Yiyin is the most obsessed, and has repeatedly appeared on stage in school entertainment to play the role of Qingyi, and has become an amateur actor. Therefore, the atmosphere of Ping opera in my home is very strong. When we returned, we often took this atmosphere as one of our luggage and brought it back to Shanghai from Sichuan. When we arrived in Shanghai, it happened to be President Chiang's 60th birthday. Mei Lanfang performed a play to celebrate his birthday. We bought opera tickets for 30,000 yuan each and went to the Tianchan Stage to watch. Before the War of Resistance, I only watched him once. At that time, I didn't like Peking Opera, and the impression had long been blurred. During the War of Resistance, I learned that he was unyielding in the occupied area of Shanghai and appreciated himself in solitude; and a friend sent his photo with a beard. I originally admired his skills, and now I admire his personality even more, so I hung the photo on the wall. I wish him good health from afar. At that time, victory was still vague. I thought to myself looking at the photo: It must be fast, how long can people live, I don't know if Mei Lang will be back on stage again, and if I will be blessed to come back and enjoy it! So when I sat in the box seat of the Tianchan Stage and saw Mei Lanfang appearing in the role of Madam Sun in Dragon and Phoenix Auspicious, I hurriedly looked around, patted myself on the back, and checked whether I was dreaming, which made the friends next to me inexplicable, and asked strangely "Don't you like to watch Mei Lanfang"? Later, he continued to perform at the China Grand Theater, and I followed him to watch, watching for five nights in a row. After he finished performing, I went to visit him.

### The Empire of Perseverance

— Newsboy

At this time and place, after reading the correspondence from London by Mr. Mao Shuqing, a special correspondent of this newspaper, I seemed to see how a big country was competing with history, and I also seemed to see how noble gentlemen were fighting with tradition. Especially in our difficult society, when extravagant meals and hunger are juxtaposed, and luxury and poverty coexist, we have learned from the reporter's news eye a moving picture of another ancient country, which is really admirable and ashamed.

In order to save foreign exchange, cigarettes, tobacco, photographic materials, and movies can be regarded as luxury goods. Because it is not easy to get porridge and rice, in the most expensive restaurants, no matter how much deposit you have in the Bank of England or how much you have in Ireland, if you want bread, you cannot have dessert. Therefore, gentlemen have to face reality, compress their lives, and have to recognize their responsibilities and fight seriously with smoking addiction, tradition, and all old memories and history for a serious fight and liquidation.

This is why every Englishman knows its meaning. Balance foreign exchange, save on life, and accelerate the rebirth of the "British Empire." Today's suffering can be exchanged for future happiness, which is naturally very cost-effective. Therefore, gentlemen are willing to endure their temper and live their lives in this way, and only seek more happiness for themselves, and are unwilling to seek foreign aid again. The plan to gnaw on other people's bones, and the Labor government's huge budget of 310 million without a fiscal deficit, has finally become the best answer to the Conservative Party's attack.

This kind of perseverance and decisiveness is really a good inspiration for us. No matter what, our society is far more turbulent and unstable than the UK, but the four words on the top of the International Hotel are not the soul of our society. Hundreds of cinemas across the country show films exchanged for gold yuan. As long as you have money, you can use your talent for extravagance and enjoy yourself to your heart's content. Why only bread and dessert? How many people in our society dare to blame foreign students for eating bread and peeling off the hard skin like the old woman in London?

"Sir, you Chinese must have a lot of food!" These words of the London woman are not only addressed to that foreign student, but to all the people of China. If Mrs. Cripps heard about it, she would have blamed the previous enthusiastic fundraising to aid China for being superfluous. Thinking about it, in the juxtaposition of extravagance and poverty, how much have we planned for the future of the country?

### Busy Doing Nothing

— Hu

A man from Arizona came back from New York, and his criticism of New Yorkers was: never relax, always busy doing nothing. Then, he gave an example to prove it. He said: "A guy came out of the subway and pushed me hard as if the police were chasing him. He rushed across the platform and walked up the steps three steps at a time. I thought he had something important, so I followed him; he ran across the road at a red light and rushed into a park. He fell on a bench all of a sudden, and then quickly got up. Do you know what he did? - He started reading the newspaper"!

Suicide is normal, suicide is okay, I am willing to see the King of Hell! Why hurt people and set fire? That's absurd!

### Li Wang's Exile to Zhi – Random Notes on Reading History, Part 5

— Xiao Dai

After King Wu launched the campaign to conquer the Shang Dynasty, the wars among the Zhou tribes temporarily came to an end. In this stable situation, the Zhou took the Yin Shang as a warning and devoted themselves to agricultural production and the development of industry and commerce. The excellent economic situation enabled the Zhou people to pass through a golden age of one hundred and twenty years.

After King Zhao Xia ascended the throne, the Zhou's ruling position began to show signs of shaking. It is said that when King Zhao Xia was touring the south across the Han River, the boatmen, disgusted with him, loaded him on a glue boat. When they reached mid-stream, the glue melted and the boat broke apart, and King Zhao died. This action carried some meaning of revenge. Later, King Ping moved the capital east to Luoyi to resist the oppression of the Western Quanrong, which was also a clear sign of the regime's decline.

The reason for this change can be analyzed as being due to the development of the new economy since the Western Zhou Dynasty. Economic development (1) corrupted the lives of the upper-class aristocrats and completely lost their ruling power; (2) made the exchange relations between the feudal states close, leading to mutual conquest between the states; (3) gradually raised the status of landlords and merchants, eventually overwhelming the aristocracy and occupying the main position in society. This crisis had been lurking, and it became more acute during the time of King Li Hu. King Li did not clearly see that his ruling power had been weakened to the extreme, while the power of the vassal states in the west, such as Qin, and in the south, such as Chu, was gradually growing and threatening him. He also never considered what methods to use to save this impending crisis and properly inherit this family business. On the contrary, because of his extravagant and dissolute life, he relied heavily on Rong Yigong, who was fond of monopolizing profits and unaware of the great disaster, as his minister, specializing in exploiting the people. At that time, the excellent economic situation corrupted the Zhou aristocracy, while the common people were pressed into the eighteenth level of hell. Their suffering can be imagined. King Li not only did not try to save the people from fire and water, but instead used Rong Yigong's hand to oppress the people, and thus popular resentment was boiling.

The "Guoyu Zhouyu" (Discourses of the States, Discourses of Zhou) has this passage:

"King Li was tyrannical, and the people of the country slandered the king. Duke Shao said, 'The people cannot bear their fate!' The king was angry and obtained a wizard from Wei to monitor those who slandered him. When they reported someone, he would kill them. The people of the country did not dare to speak, and exchanged glances on the road. The king was pleased and told Duke Shao, 'I can stop slander now; they dare not speak.' Duke Shao said, 'This is blocking it. Preventing the people's mouths is more dangerous than preventing a river. If a river is blocked, it will burst and injure many people, and the same is true for the people. Therefore, those who manage rivers dredge them and let them flow, and those who govern the people encourage them to speak... The people's mouths are like the mountains and rivers of the earth, from which wealth and resources come forth. They are like the fertile wetlands, from which food and clothing are produced. From the expression of the mouth, good and bad arise. Doing good and preparing for bad are the ways to enrich wealth, resources, food, and clothing. The people deliberate in their hearts and express it through their mouths, and then accomplish it and put it into action. How can it be blocked? If you block their mouths, how long can you last?' The king did not listen, and so the people of the country dared not speak out. After three years, they exiled the king to Zhi."

Duke Shao's words were very thorough and contained profound philosophy, but King Li did not adopt them. King Li killed a few people who slandered him, and when he no longer heard voices of slander, he thought that the world was at peace, and said with self-satisfaction, "I can stop slander now!" Little did he know that in less than three years, he would be exiled to Zhi by the people.

### Circulation

— Xing

Because of the sluggish market, factories and shops are closing down, shrinking, laying off employees, and cutting salaries.

Because of layoffs and salary cuts, life in general becomes more difficult.

Because life becomes more difficult, purchasing power becomes weaker.

Because purchasing power becomes weaker, the sluggish market becomes more profound.

### Pay Attention to Japan

— Ke Pei

This is not a nightmare. Just look at the news from various newspapers on the fourth:

"Japan hopes to jointly administer the Ryukyu Islands with the United States, obtain fishing rights near the Kuril Islands and Sakhalin Island, and obtain special immigration rights in Taiwan."

It is undeniable that due to mutual suspicion among the Allied countries after the victory, the defeated country of Japan has already risen again. This is chilling for our country, which is close to Japan!

The war ended only two years ago, but the changes in the past two years have been too great. The defeated country of Japan has once again become the economic hub of East Asia. Looking back at China, one of the four major powers, due to the long-term war after the victory, the destruction cannot be rebuilt, and the construction is destroyed again, and it has long been disfigured.

According to a friend who recently came from Japan, "The Japanese are very ambitious. The destruction of the war is a hundred times greater than that in China, but today's Japan has embarked on the road to production." Many people are afraid of Japan's revival. We feel that Japan's post-war revival is necessary, just like people need rest after illness. I agree with Mr. Xie Bingxin's statement on this point.

Even so, we cannot forget this cruel humiliation. Germany after the First World War is a lesson from the past. We must abolish all kinds of rights that go beyond the scope, such as the right to immigrate to Taiwan and the trusteeship of Ryukyu.

In short, it is unnecessary to be afraid of Japan's revival, and at the same time it is useless. Control and restriction are only superficial measures. The fundamental solution is to revive ourselves. Only by relying on our own strength can we eliminate the threat from others.

### Chronicle of a Beleaguered City

— Qin Shouou

Lan's face, which was always able to maintain superhuman composure on weekdays, had also become paler, but she did not speak, and her eyes remained closed.

"Don't panic, Lan, I will help you into the car!" Zhu Zhaonian, whose emotions were greatly stirred, couldn't help but lean down and say quietly.

Lan shook her head hastily.

Zhu Zhaonian realized that she was afraid that his help would make it possible to transmit the disease. But at this time, how could he take so much into account?

"But we can't trouble others!" He said with a smile: "And my physique is very strong, and I have always been immune to all diseases." As he said that, he immediately bent down, stretched out his arms, and gently lifted Lan and the felt together from the rattan chair.

Several kind-hearted people in the car saw this situation and automatically squeezed together to make a gap about a foot wide and two or three feet long, so that Old Zhu could just lay Lan flat on top of the many luggage rolls and boxes. In this way, being half-leaning and half-lying was at least less strenuous than sitting. Zhang Chang blushed and thanked everyone.

The sound of Fei Fei crying and making a lot of noise came from twenty or thirty yards away, and it sounded particularly clear in the ears of Lan and Old Zhu.

"Call her here!" Lan opened her eyes and looked at Old Zhu, and with great effort blurted out these three words.

Zhu Zhaonian, however, believed that there was no need to let Fei Fei come to say goodbye to her mother at this time, because this would only create confusion.

"The car is about to leave, I think it's better not to call her..." He said very gently.

"No..." An anxious look appeared on Lan's face, "This...this child...is very...very impatient...if she cries too hard...she will...will faint..."

This was something that Zhu Zhaonian had not anticipated. He panicked and turned around to rush out of the crowd. But it was too late. By the time he found Fei Fei, the little girl had already cried to the point of fainting in the arms of the female member who was leading her. Two or three people were anxiously sweating while performing first aid.

"Quick! Quick! Cold towel! Cold towel!" Old Zhu pushed another member desperately, telling him to hurry back to the teahouse to get a cold towel, while hurriedly unbuttoning Fei Fei's clothes, laying her flat on the ground, and giving her artificial respiration himself.
