### Approved by the Joint Committee Review: Postponing the Opening of Trade with Japan; To Be Submitted to the Political Affairs Conference Today for a Final Decision

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Nanjing, 28th] The issue of opening trade with Japan, which has been attracting attention from all sides, was discussed at the National Economic Commission's subcommittee meeting on the morning of the 28th. It was decided to comply with public opinion and postpone the opening. The dispatch of a commercial delegation to Japan will also be postponed. This is indeed a major victory for public opinion. Today's meeting was convened by Wang Yunwu, with Chen Qitian, Wu Yunchu, and others in attendance. During the meeting, Chen Qitian advocated that public opinion should be heeded and reconsidered. Wu Yunchu also spoke on behalf of the business community, hoping that the authorities would take public opinion seriously. Other committee members also agreed that it was necessary to postpone the matter for further discussion. A decision was made to postpone the handling of the matter. This reporter made a special visit to Mr. Chen Qitian regarding this matter, and he provided the following key points of the review committee's decision: (1) The opening of private trade with Japan was initiated by the United Nations Far Eastern Commission and the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers in Japan. Our government should adopt a reserved attitude in diplomatic procedures. (2) The dispatch of a Chinese private commercial delegation to Japan will be temporarily postponed, adopting the suggestions of the Senate Standing Committee and the opinions of business leaders. (3) The barter trade with Japan, managed by government commercial representatives (including business with cash settlements), will continue. (4) If businesses have goods for import and export with Japan, they can temporarily entrust them to government commercial representatives. The above review opinions will be submitted to the Political Affairs Conference on the 29th for a final decision.

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Nanjing, 28th] Wu Yunchu, Chairman of the Industrial Association and member of the National Economic Commission, told reporters after the adjournment of the National Economic Commission's subcommittee meeting on the afternoon of the 28th that he was pleased that the subcommittee had complied with public opinion and suspended the opening of trade with Japan.

### General Wedemeyer Successfully Concludes Mission and Returns to the Capital; Numerous Materials Obtained During Two Days in Shanghai; Engineering Advisor Discusses Changes in Detail with Minister of Communications Yesterday

[Report from Our Newspaper] General Wedemeyer and the entire investigation team that came to Shanghai returned to the capital by special plane at 10:00 AM yesterday from Jiangwan Airport. Mayor Wu's representative Zhang Bide, Director Wei Jingmeng of the Shanghai Office of the Information Bureau, and Director Connaught of the United States Information Service all saw them off at the airport. The investigation team's news advisor, Watson, expressed deep gratitude for the assistance of the local press. After returning to the capital, General Wedemeyer may go to Peiping at the end of the month, but he may also first go to Qingdao this Thursday to inspect the naval base. Furthermore, according to observations by qualified individuals in this city, General Wedemeyer's visit to Shanghai was mainly to inquire about the wishes of American businessmen in China after the United States provides economic aid to China, in addition to understanding China's financial and commercial strength.

[United Press Dispatch from Nanjing, 28th] General Wedemeyer and his party returned to the capital at 11:30 AM today and will spend several days here organizing the information they have collected. Members of his delegation will also hold individual meetings and conduct independent investigations in Shanghai.

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Nanjing, 28th] After General Wedemeyer and his party returned to the capital, they had lunch with Ambassador Stuart and Philip D. Reed at the Shanghai Road residence this afternoon. The three had a very pleasant conversation. After a short rest and handling official business, General Wedemeyer, accompanied by an engineering advisor, Rear Admiral Drexel, and news advisor Watson, attended a banquet at Premier Zhang Qun's residence at 8:00 PM. Ambassador Stuart and Fu Jingbo were also invited to attend. According to Watson, they will leave the capital for Qingdao, Peiping, and Tianjin at the end of this week or early next week for inspection. Trips to Changchun and Taiwan will depend on the situation and time. There are currently no plans to go to Soviet-occupied areas such as Lushun and Dalian. Watson said that China is a very large country, and their schedule is too tight. It is difficult to conduct investigations in all areas and to gain in-depth understanding everywhere. Therefore, the method of conducting their work will be to first summarize, analyze, compare, and study the materials obtained from the outside world, and then make independent judgments based on what they have personally heard and seen.

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Nanjing, 28th] The U.S. Embassy issued a written statement today, announcing that General Wedemeyer and his delegation returned to Nanjing on the morning of the 28th after a busy two-day stay in Shanghai. During these two days, they obtained a significant amount of information, some from Chinese officials and business leaders (the list was published daily in the communiqu√©s issued by General Wedemeyer's temporary office in Shanghai), some detailed reports prepared in advance by U.S. Consul General Davis in Shanghai and his consular staff, and some reports from individuals in Shanghai's American business community. The statement stated: "Additional valuable information continues to be submitted to the delegation from other sources. One source is delivered by individuals familiar with various issues in China, and some members of the delegation will automatically visit these individuals. Another source comes from individuals in various regions and professions who voluntarily and out of patriotic zeal wish to provide information and suggestions to General Wedemeyer's delegation." The statement continued: "Due to the collection of information from various sources, a large amount of information has been collected in the first week of General Wedemeyer's delegation's visit to China. General Wedemeyer and his advisors will spend most of their time this week comparing and studying the existing and continuously received data reports." The embassy also reiterated that the delegation's primary purpose remains to investigate the facts, as it has been in the past.

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Nanjing, 28th] Various advisors of the Wedemeyer delegation have begun individual meetings with various parties. Engineering advisor Drexel and economic advisor Walker visited Yu Dawei, Minister of Communications, at the Ministry of Communications at 4:00 PM on the 28th for lengthy and confidential talks. Walker is scheduled to visit Chen Qitian, Minister of Economic Affairs, on the morning of the 29th.

### Central Executive Committee Holds Extraordinary Meeting; Issues of Kuomintang Members Running for National Assembly and Legislative Yuan Seats; Two Hours of Discussion Leads to the Formation of Five Committees for Joint Study

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Nanjing, 28th] The Central Executive Committee held an extraordinary meeting at 10:00 AM on the 28th to discuss the issue of Kuomintang members participating in the elections for the National Assembly and the Legislative Yuan.

### Special Envoy Wedemeyer's Mission Here is to Study the Methods of Assisting China; Zhang Junmai States After Visiting General Wedemeyer

[Report from Our Newspaper] Zhang Junmai, Chairman of the China Democratic Socialist Party, issued the following statement after visiting General Wedemeyer: "General Wedemeyer's words and attitude made people deeply feel his overflowing friendship, broad-mindedness, and lack of prejudice. In addition to hoping that visitors would provide information and suggestions, he also requested frank criticism of current U.S. policies. It was rumored that General Wedemeyer's visit was to investigate whether China was worthy of assistance and that he would support Japan to replace our country if necessary. After my meeting with General Wedemeyer, I believe that this statement is completely inaccurate. General Wedemeyer's visit is actually to study which method is most effective in assisting China's revival. As for the opinions I contributed to General Wedemeyer, in addition to the general practical situation, they are roughly as follows: In the political aspect, I advocate thoroughly implementing the constitution to transform politics and improve efficiency. The current low level of political efficiency is not a personnel problem, but a problem of the entire system. In the economic aspect, I hope to restore stability as soon as possible. In the military aspect, I advocate improving the quality of the military and emphasizing quality over quantity. General Wedemeyer quite agreed with this point." When asked by reporters whether the central government had accepted the suggestion of reforming local politics, Zhang said: "I have suggested to the government to increase the power of the provinces, so as to avoid the need to go through the central government for everything. It takes time and effort to implement official documents. This point has been approved by the Chairman and is only waiting for actual implementation. As for the proportion of various parties in universal suffrage, Zhang acknowledged that the issue of three-one-one is generally no longer a problem and can be officially announced after the Kuomintang Central Executive Committee approves it."

### Philip Reed Arrives in the Capital; Another Batch of Journalist Delegation Returns to Shanghai

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Nanjing, 28th] Philip D.

### Requisitioning Private Foreign Deposits: Limited to Facts, Unable to Force; Hoping that Citizens Will Voluntarily Declare and Await Use

[Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper in Nanjing, 28th] American businessmen in Shanghai believe that before the United States loans money to China, China should first use private deposits in the United States worth 500 million U.S. dollars to ensure that China is doing its best to help itself. When related parties here commented on this matter on the 28th, they first pointed out that although China relies on foreign aid in the process of revival, it has never given up on self-reliance. Premier Zhang implied this to the people as soon as he took office and is working in this direction.

Intended to Requisition Loans from British and American Banks During the War but Failed

As for the use of private deposits in the United States, our government intended to requisition loans during the war and once drafted "Measures for Requisitioning and Lending People's Foreign Exchange Assets," which was transferred by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to the British and American governments for assistance. The British banking community stated that bank depositors' names are not marked with nationality, and the amount of each account should be kept confidential. Disclosing depositors' assets would violate the trust and inevitably affect London's position as an international financial center, and insisted on opposing it. The United States also responded in the same way. After the war ended, the British and American governments successively announced the lifting of the seizure order, and this matter became increasingly impossible to handle. After the promulgation of the Emergency Economic Measures in February of this year, the British and American governments were consulted again, and the British and American embassies in China replied on March 10th and 14th of this year that the British and American governments still could not provide depositors' names. In the past, the U.S. government, in order to facilitate the seizure of foreigners' deposits, once investigated the assets of various countries in the United States in 1941, but it never officially disclosed them to the public. Our government has no way of knowing the details, and this information must have changed since the United States announced the lifting of the seizure, and it is no longer usable. Therefore, the government can only hope that the people will voluntarily declare to the Ministry of Finance and will draft "Measures for the Registration and Declaration of Foreign Exchange Assets of Citizens of the Republic of China Abroad." The government's issuance of U.S. dollar bonds also stipulates that people can purchase them with U.S. dollar deposits. Later, someone suggested purchasing machinery in the United States with foreign deposits, providing special convenience. The purpose of all this is to encourage private individuals to use foreign deposits to help domestic construction. The economic reform plan recently approved by the National Economic Commission also stipulates that "Citizens' assets abroad should be declared within a limited time and properly utilized," which shows that our government has always been paying attention to the use of private deposits in the United States. Part of this matter depends on the patriotism of the people, but it also depends on the assistance of friendly countries. Furthermore, it is rumored that our private deposits in the United States amount to 500 million U.S. dollars. According to reliable estimates, the total amount is only 350 million U.S. dollars.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 28th] The land tax conference held provincial meetings all day on the 28th, presided over by Yu Feipeng, to conduct thorough discussions on the tax quota for each province and related technical issues.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 28th] Chairman Huang Xuchu of Guangxi arrived in Nanjing by plane from Guilin at 4:20 p.m. on the 28th to attend the food conference. He will continue to work hard to raise funds for disaster relief in Guangxi.

[Our Guilin Dispatch, 28th] Guangxi Provincial Chairman Huang Xuchu originally intended to stay in the province to deal with the severe disaster situation, but after receiving an urgent telegram from the Executive Yuan, he traveled to Beijing on the 28th with Secretary-General Huang Zhong and Advisor Pan Youqin.

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 28th] During the Thirty-Sixth Annual Land Tax Conference, supervisors Xiang Naiqi, He Hanwen, Wang Shuhui, Bai Rui, Li Zhengle, Ma Yaonan, Shi Ying, Yu Fen, Wang Zixian, and others from the Control Yuan suggested three improvements to the land tax collection method. It is said that the problem with land tax collection is not the excessive tax rate, but the unequal burden, especially since the implementation of land reporting. Due to poor planning and inadequate techniques, the burden on the people has become increasingly uneven, with the light burden becoming lighter and the heavy burden becoming heavier. Moreover, those with lighter burdens are often wealthy and powerful landlords, while those with heavier burdens are mostly small landowners, self-cultivators, and lower-middle-class farmers. Therefore, in recent years, land has become increasingly concentrated, and the number of people losing their livelihoods has been increasing, which runs counter to the policy of equalizing land ownership and supporting independent farmers. They proposed three minimum improvements: (1) According to the land report from Hunan, the fertile areas by the lake are divided into three grades and nine classes for taxation, while the barren areas are divided into two grades and six classes. This reflects the beautiful intention of regulating surplus and deficiency. However, in reality, in the fertile counties, the land of the highest grade is taxed at only about five jiao per mu, and the tax decreases successively. The average tax rate for the three grades and nine classes is no more than five jiao for the heavier taxed land and about three jiao for the lighter taxed land. In the barren counties, the land of the highest grade is taxed at more than eight jiao per mu, such as in Yuanling. In other counties, it is also more than seven jiao. Although the top three grades are nominally exempted, the average tax rate for the remaining two grades and six classes is more than seven jiao for the heavier taxed land and about six jiao for the lighter taxed land. In order to equalize the burden between counties, all counties with an average tax rate exceeding five jiao per mu should be reduced to five jiao, and the total amount should be recalculated and redistributed according to the grade of the county. (2) China's land tax collection has combined the regular tax and surcharges into one, with a tax rate of four dou per yuan, which is about 15% of the net income. In order to equalize the burden between individuals, any taxpayer whose tax payment exceeds 20% of their net income may apply to the Land Management Office for a reduction to 15%. However, they must declare that if any unmeasured land is discovered, the unmeasured land will be confiscated, and they will be severely punished. At the same time, the Land Management Office will investigate wealthy and powerful families. If their tax payment is less than 10% of their net income, their land tax may be increased to 15%, and an investigation may be conducted to determine if there are any unmeasured lands. The specific investigation methods will be determined separately. (3) China's agricultural stage has not yet overcome nature and is still dominated by natural forces. When determining the grade of land, the tax burden should not exceed the land's productivity. Before achieving technical accuracy and fair evaluation, the principle of "better to be cautious than to be bold" should be followed. It is better to err on the side of leniency than on the side of severity, because storing wealth among the people is ultimately beneficial to the country.

### Communist Bandits Fiercely Attack Linqu with 100,000 Troops; National Army Defends Resolutely Amidst Bloody Situation; Recapture Machang and Qingxian on the Northern Section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway

[Our Jinan Dispatch, 28th] The battle for Linqu is becoming increasingly fierce. Starting on the evening of the 27th, the Communist bandits increased from five columns to seven, totaling over 100,000 troops, and launched a fierce attack on all sides of the city walls. The intensity of the battle is unprecedented. By dawn on the 28th, the north and south gates had been breached by the bandits. As of the time of this dispatch, fierce hand-to-hand combat is still ongoing in the streets. The troops responsible for defending the city are fighting against the bandits' forces, which are fifteen times their size, for five days and nights, and have killed more than 30,000 bandits. Wang Yaowu has praised their firm fighting spirit and morale and issued a commendation order. Furthermore, Mount Jushan, which overlooks the entire city from Likexu Village in the east of Linqu City, is also still being firmly defended by the National Army.

[Our Linyi Dispatch, 28th] As of the evening of the 28th, the situation in Linqu is unclear.

[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 28th] The National Army, advancing north from Yuezhuang, reached the line of Shangwujing, southwest of Linqu, on the afternoon of the 27th, and is currently engaging with the enemy.

[Central News Agency, Jinan, 27th] The National Army recaptured Dongping County on the afternoon of the 27th.

[Our Yanzhou Dispatch, 28th] The five columns of Liu Bocheng, who are harassing southwestern Shandong, except for the First and Seventh Columns, which have crossed the Yellow River from Dukou, the remaining Second, Third, and Sixth Columns have been surrounded by the National Army since the 27th in the Liuguanshan area south of Juye, west of Yangshanji. In the past two days, they have suffered another four battalions of casualties.

[Our Tianjin Dispatch, 28th] The National Army on the northern section of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway launched an offensive at dawn on the 28th. At 8 a.m., they recaptured Liuhe Town, more than ten li southwest of Tangguantun. Part of the army is sweeping westward, and the main force is pointing south. At 10 a.m., they recaptured Machang, and at 12:45 p.m., they recaptured Qingxian, and are continuing to advance. Cangxian is expected to be captured soon. In coordination with the military progress, the Tianjin-Pukou Railway will begin repairs on the section between Jinghai and Tangguantun on the 29th. According to the investigation, more than 200 steel rails and approximately 20,000 sleepers are missing. The railway bureau is working hard to collect them.

[Our Baoding Dispatch, 28th] The National Army in the western Hebei mountainous area is advancing westward in a rapid offensive. The two groups of troops moving west from Wangdu and Dingxian met at Quyang yesterday afternoon, turned south, and attacked the Communist bandits' old nest in the western mountainous area of Xingtang. The overall battle situation is now one-sided, with the bandits avoiding battle and fleeing in disarray, and the National Army pursuing relentlessly. Furthermore, the encircling army moving north from Shijiazhuang is rapidly advancing along the Hutuo River, attacking into Pingshan territory. The National Army forces from the north and south are echoing each other and launching a pincer attack, and Gaocheng will soon be recaptured. The National Army north of Baoding is also attacking the forces of the bandit Ma Hui west of Xushui. The National Army has launched a full-scale offensive on the western side of the Ping-Shi Road.

### National Army Division Commander Yang Gancai Firmly Defends Teng County; Defeats Communist Bandits Four Times His Number

[Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 28th] National Army Division Commander Yang Gancai, who firmly defended Teng County, led a single brigade and fought fiercely for seven days and nights, defeating Communist bandits four times his number, creating a turning point for victory in the Shandong war situation. The government authorities, in recognition of his brave fighting, awarded him a bonus of 300 million yuan. The division's Chief of Staff, Major General Ren Jingxiu, recently came to Xuzhou on official business and spoke to reporters about the seven-day defense of Teng County and his post-war review. He first stated: The Communist bandits launched a full-scale attack on Teng County, and their slogans were: "(1) Take Teng County to welcome the upcoming major counter-offensive. (2) Strive to become a hero who enters the city in the future. (3) Find a way to take Teng County and make great contributions." This proves that the Communist bandits were eager to recapture the momentum lost in the Yishan mountainous area and were eager to capture the city. Their attack on Teng County was mainly carried out by a part of the Fifth Column with more than 40,000 troops. On the 12th, they fled northwest and first engaged in fierce battles with the National Army defense units in Dongshahe and Nanshahe outside Teng County. On the 14th, they began to attack the city. From the evening of the 14th to the 17th, they hid during the day and launched fierce attacks on the four gates at night, with the 17th being the most intense. On the morning of the 18th, their Second Division moved northeast, attempting to prevent National Army reinforcements, while the remaining forces continued to attack the city. On the afternoon of the 19th, the Fourth Column was reinforced from the Zouxian area. By the evening of the 20th, the Communist bandits' offensive had subsided slightly due to heavy casualties, and reinforcements from various National Army routes had arrived one after another. Before dawn on the 21st, the Communist bandits fled northeast. In the seven-day battle, although the Communist bandits had several times entered the city walls, they were all driven back. In total, the Communist bandits suffered casualties of 18,000 to 20,000, with over 200 captured and over 200 surrendering voluntarily. The National Army's losses were less than one-seventh of that. Ren also said: The factors contributing to this victory were: (1) The soldiers fought bravely, with strong determination, strict command and supervision, and unity from top to bottom. (2) Correct judgment of the enemy's situation and thorough preparation. (3) The strong defense of outposts outside the city formed a mutually supportive relationship with the defending troops inside the city. (4) The political workers and the people of the People's Service Corps cooperated with the army in combat, creating harmony between the military and the civilians. (5) Strong artillery firepower and complete defense facilities. Ren concluded by saying: The Communist bandits lacked ammunition and food, their morale was low, and the people were no longer willing to be used by them. This was the main reason for the Communist bandits' defeat.

### National Army Northeast of Xinxian Destroys Secret Underground Caves

[Central News Agency, Taiyuan, 27th] The National Army in Xinxian recently launched a mopping-up operation and destroyed three secret underground caves used by Communist bandits in Xiacaocaozhang, about 30 li northeast of the city, crushing the enemy's treacherous activities. Xiacaocaozhang is located at the intersection of Xinxian and Dingxiang counties. Communist bandits often hide in underground caves there and ambush the National Army. On the 18th, the National Army went to carry out a mopping-up operation. Most of the bandits fled upon hearing the news. The secret underground caves were discovered after a thorough investigation by the National Army and were immediately destroyed. One of the caves was located in the Sanfo Temple in the village, five chi high and three cun wide, extending for twelve li, connecting to Gaocun. The middle cave was located under the Niangniang Temple in the village, eight li long, connecting to Daiye. One cave was located south of the village, marked with a "soul-leading" sign and a false epitaph. The cave was more than eight li long, communicating with Lantaigou in Dingxiang. After these three caves were destroyed, the nearby bandits lost their support.

### New Soldiers in Various Counties of Yunnan Join the Ranks; Kang Province Requests Reduction of Recruitment Quota

[Our Kunming Dispatch, 28th] Yunnan's recruitment quota for the 36th year is 14,000 men. The Ministry of National Defense has ordered that the quota be filled by the end of September, pending dispatch. The new soldier battalions of the Yunnan Military Region have already departed and are heading to various counties to receive new soldiers and distribute them to various districts for training.

[Our Ya'an Dispatch, 28th] The assigned troop levy for Kang Province is 2,700 men, to be completed within three months. The provincial authorities believe that the situation of the Tibetan and Qiang ethnic groups in Kang Province is special, making it difficult to levy troops. The quota only applies to the Han Chinese, whose total population is one million. After deducting the elderly, weak, women, and children, the number of able-bodied men of conscription age is limited, making it difficult to fulfill the predetermined levy. Furthermore, it is currently the busy farming season, making it even more difficult to collect troops as scheduled. In order to alleviate this difficulty, a request has been made to the Ministry of National Defense to reduce the recruitment quota appropriately, and to strictly postpone the levy until September.

Upon receiving the report, the provincial government not only telegraphed instructions to make every effort to rescue the victims, but also telegraphed the Ministry of Water Resources. Jianying has now dispatched Inspector Feng Shouxin to Pixian to investigate the flood situation.

### Methods for Compiling Electoral Rolls for National Assembly Representatives and Legislative Yuan Members; Election General Office Provides Clarification

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 28th] Various parties have requested the Election General Office to clarify how to compile electoral rolls for National Assembly Representatives and Legislative Yuan members. The Office recently issued the following clarification on this point:

(1) For regional elections of National Assembly Representatives, the competent election authorities (county and city election offices, or county-administered city election offices) shall prepare two copies each of the electoral roll for each electoral district, recording the name, gender, age, place of origin, occupation, and address of each voter, as well as whether or not they have the right to be elected. This shall be completed forty days before the election and publicly announced. The aforementioned period of forty days may be advanced by fifteen days, totaling fifty-five days, according to practical needs. At the same time, one copy of the roll shall be submitted to the superior election authority for record, and the total number of voters shall be forwarded to the Election General Office for record. Electoral rolls for Legislative Yuan members shall be completed and publicly announced fifty days before the election, and may be advanced by fifteen days, totaling sixty-five days. The electoral roll may be made on ten-line paper to ensure uniformity. The preparation of electoral rolls for Mongolian, Tibetan, and overseas Chinese shall be the same as for regional elections.

(2) The preparation and reporting date of electoral rolls for National Assembly representatives of occupational and women's groups and Legislative Yuan members of occupational groups shall be the same as for regional elections. However, the competent election authorities for National Assembly representatives of each occupational and women's group and Legislative Yuan members of occupational groups shall first notify each group to prepare a clear list recording the following items ninety days before the election to serve as the basis for determining the qualifications of voters: 1. Organizational charter, establishment procedure, and its process. 2. Registration authority and date of registration. 3. Staff and their experience. 4. Member's name, gender, age, place of origin, address, and length of time engaged in the occupation. 5. The names of other groups in which members are also members, and a statement of which group they have chosen to participate in the election.

(3) In the frontier areas (Sichuan, Xikang, Yunnan, Guizhou, Guangxi, Hunan), the competent authorities shall prepare separate electoral rolls for each ethnic group in each area who meet the voter requirements. The preparation and announcement date shall be the same as for regional elections. However, the election ballots shall be manufactured based on the electoral rolls, counted separately, and a list shall be compiled after the public announcement, with the number of votes received noted and reported to the superior election authority for tabulation and public announcement.

(4) For citizens with special living habits in the interior (i.e., Hui Muslims living in various places), the competent authorities shall prepare separate electoral rolls for each area where the Hui Muslims meet the voter requirements. The date shall be the same as for regional elections. The election ballots shall be counted separately, and after the public announcement, a list shall be compiled, with the number of votes received noted and forwarded to the Election General Office for tabulation and public announcement.

### Question of Women's Place of Origin in Elections

Election General Office also Provides Clarification

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 28th] The Election General Office has clarified whether women should participate in elections based on their registered domicile or their original domicile. It is stated that Article 16, Paragraph 2, of the Enforcement Regulations of the Law on the Election and Recall of National Assembly Representatives, and Article 15, Paragraph 2, of the Enforcement Regulations of the Law on the Election and Recall of Legislative Yuan Members, stipulate that women who have not yet registered their domicile due to marriage or divorce may still apply to register as candidates for election in their original domicile. Therefore, women who are married but have not yet registered their domicile in their husband's domicile may participate in the election in their original domicile. If they have already registered their domicile in their husband's domicile, they may choose to participate in the election in either their registered domicile or their original domicile.

### Legislative Yuan's Two Committees Pass Sino-British Air Transport Agreement at Review Meeting

[Our Nanjing Dispatch, 28th] The Sino-British Air Transport Agreement was reviewed and passed by the Economic and Foreign Affairs Committees of the Legislative Yuan on the morning of the 28th and will be ratified when the Legislative Yuan reconvenes. Today's review meeting was presided over by Dai Xiujun, Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, and attended by more than thirty committee members. Dai Xiujun first gave a report, and then the review began. Most committee members expressed dissatisfaction with the British side's use of Hong Kong as the starting point for the air route, believing that the British side clearly regards Hong Kong as its territory. Dai explained that the British side strongly argued for this during the negotiations, but the current regulations have been revised significantly compared to the British side's original proposal, and it is unlikely to create difficulties for our future recovery of Hong Kong. The case has been reviewed at the meeting, and it has been decided to handle it flexibly, allowing it to be signed in advance and then ratified after the Legislative Yuan reconvenes.

### Famous Southern Product Lychee Ripe; Fuzhou Market Price 3-4,000 Yuan per Catty; to be Transported North by Special Plane for Sale in Beijing and Shanghai

[Central News Agency, Fuzhou, 28th] Lychee, a fine fruit product from the south, is now ripe. There are those who have negotiated to charter planes to transport lychees to Beijing and Shanghai for sale. The market price here was 6,000 yuan per catty when it first ripened, and has recently gradually dropped to 3-4,000 yuan. Many old mansions and residences in the Rongcheng area have lychee trees planted in their gardens. At this time, they are laden with fruit, with thousands upon thousands of them, evenly distributed like crimson pearls, tempting people over the walls, causing their mouths to water. The ancient temple Xichan Temple in the western suburbs of the city also has many fine varieties planted, with small seeds, thick flesh, lots of juice, and a sweet taste, which are popular among the people. According to past practice, each tourist could pay a certain incense fee and enjoy eating as much as they liked. This practice has been abolished this year, and the value is measured. Gluttons feel disappointed. Lychee, also known as "Lizi" or "Danli," belongs to the Sapindaceae family. China is rich in lychees, especially in Fujian and Guangdong. The tree is an evergreen tree, up to two or three zhang tall, with lush, overlapping leaves, shaped like a canopy. The leaves are pinnately compound. The fruit sets in June, is round, larger than a pigeon egg, and has scaly skin. When ripe, it is completely red. The tree is afraid of frost and snow and is suitable for planting in subtropical or warm-temperate zones. If the west wind blows during flowering, it will not easily set fruit. It is mostÂøåscented musk, which will cause all the flowers and fruits to fall. Putian, Fuzhou, Quanzhou, and Zhangzhou in Fujian are all major producing areas. The variety from Putian is the best. The fruit is easy to rot and is not suitable for long journeys. Fruit farmers mostly make lychee dried fruit, which is sold throughout the country. People regard it as a tonic and always like to eat it. Before the war, Fujian Province produced 30,000 dan per year, which, at the current price of 3,000 yuan per catty, would be 9 billion yuan. However, production and sales have declined sharply since the victory. Last year, only more than 4,000 dan were produced. The production this year is relatively abundant, but the north is currently at war, making foreign sales difficult. Furthermore, there is a fierce and stubborn pest of lychee called "chunky-like," which is very harmful every year. The previous method of changing the location of bird nests is now being tested using its "natural enemy," the parasitoid wasp, and parasitic bacteria to eliminate it, which has been successful and will be applied in practice.

### Beiping Uncovers a Fake Kidnapping Case; Complicated Case with Seven Arrested

[Our Beiping Dispatch, 28th] An intricate fake kidnapping case has been uncovered in the ancient city, and seven people have been arrested. The ringleader, Han Shouguang, falsely claimed to be a lieutenant general advisor of the Ping-Han Railway Protection Headquarters. Two accomplices, Jiang Bohua and Guo Zanliang, claimed to be reporters for the Minyu News Agency (which the agency has now denied). Another ringleader, Gao Guoying, graduated from Nagasaki High School in Japan. The entire case involves many more people and is currently under development. On the 18th of this month, Zhang Huimin was invited by his friend Sun Bochuan to discuss something. When he arrived at Sun's house, he was told that Sun was out and had not returned. When Zhang was returning, he was kidnapped by two worker-like people onto a car, blindfolded, and taken to the ringleader Han's house. The next day, he was dressed in military uniform, falsely set up a court, and told that Zhang was colluding with the Communist Party and smuggling military supplies. Three days later, Sun Bochuan, who originally invited Zhang to talk, suddenly told Zhang that he had been kidnapped and interrogated by "Advisor Han" in the same situation a few days ago (Zhang also knew that this had happened, but it was a planned disguise), and his son-in-law Gao Guoying had run around to release him. Zhang could be released if he produced fifty gold bars, so Zhang turned to Sun to ask his son-in-law to intercede. As a result, Zhang was released with a check for 10 million yuan and told not to publicize it. Until the 27th, because he recognized Sun's daughter (Gao's fianc√©e) and Sun's daughter-in-law who went to the silver shop to withdraw money, he aroused suspicion, and the seven accomplices were arrested by the Inspection Office, and the whole case was revealed.

### Editorial: Measures Should Be Taken Regarding Trade with Japan

Regarding the issue of opening private trade with Japan, after the Supervisory Committee member Wan Can and others proposed that the government postpone the opening and advocated stopping the dispatch of business investigation groups to Japan, our newspaper's editorial on the 21st echoed this sentiment, stating strongly that as the issue of Japanese reparations has not been resolved and a peace treaty with Japan has not been signed, hastily opening Sino-Japanese private trade would do more harm than good to our country's actual interests. Recently, the Shanghai business community has unanimously advocated that the opening of trade with Japan should be discussed slowly to avoid repeating the mistakes of economic aggression before the war. National Assembly members Zheng Kuiyi and others proposed "requesting the government to postpone the opening of trade with Japan before signing a peace treaty with Japan," and Xue Mingjian and others proposed "planning to request the government to postpone the opening of trade with Japan." These proposals were debated and established at the plenary review meeting of the Standing Committee of the National Assembly on the 26th. Two methods were decided and sent to the government for handling: (1) Request the government to postpone the opening of private trade with Japan before the peace treaty is signed; (2) In order to achieve temporary mutual assistance with Japan, the past barter trade methods with Japan can be improved or expanded. We believe that the National Assembly's proposal is correct. The deadline of August 15th is approaching in an instant. The government should quickly announce its decision to inform the public and dispel doubts.

International trade, like normal exchanges between countries, is naturally neither supported nor opposed in today's world economy's prosperity and development. Regarding the opening of trade with Japan, the public and business community's opinion is to advocate for a time-based reservation, waiting for Japanese reparations to be determined and a peace treaty to be signed before restoring normal private trade relations. In the current transition period, for mutual assistance, the barter trade conducted by the Central Trust Bureau with Japan can be widened in scope and improved or expanded in method. There is no need to wait for the opening of private trade with Japan. This view of the National Assembly members and the business community is far-sighted and reasonable. From any point of view, restoring Sino-Japanese private trade at this time only benefits Japan unilaterally and the interests of a small number of merchants, which is actually harmful and not beneficial to the country and the nation. Our country's issue has reached the time for the government to choose. The authorities in charge of foreign trade should consider the interests of the country and the future of our country's industry, and should not make overly hasty decisions.

Looking at Japanese newspapers and magazines, the Katayama government and private trade associations have formulated various ambitious plans for the opening of trade, and regard the restoration of overseas trade as the starting point for Japan's industrial recovery. They even hope to obtain a $1 billion loan from the United States through this. The so-called obligation of war reparations has long been put out of their minds and is not asked or discussed. Especially Japanese private merchants, upon hearing that MacArthur's headquarters will open private trade on August 15th, are all happily telling each other the good news. They are organizing groups to go to China, Nanyang, Taiwan, and the Northeast after August 15th. In their minds, they all believe that the opportunity for revival has arrived, and Japan's good fortune to rise again has arrived. If we hastily restore Sino-Japanese private trade under this situation, we will not only fall into the trap of "industrial Japan and agricultural China," but also weaken our speaking position in the formal peace conference. If we unfortunately take this step, then we will have won the victory on the battlefield after eight years of resistance, but we will encounter defeat at the conference table. This is a major event that concerns our country's century-old national plan, national integrity, and international reputation, and it must be carefully observed and carefully considered!

So-called private trade is ordinary free trade, and the opening of private trade is the restoration of free trade. This is a major event related to the vitality of a country's economic lifeline. According to general practice, the restoration of private trade should be based on a treaty of commerce, stipulating tariff rates, merchant ship activities, smuggling returns, or exchange rates, etc., under the principle of equality and mutual benefit. Now that China and Japan are in a state of non-diplomatic relations and a peace treaty has not been signed, a treaty of commerce cannot be signed, and it is impossible to establish private trade. At this time, if we seek temporary mutual assistance, the two countries' "barter trade" method is a reasonable transitional method. However, if it is deemed necessary, it can naturally be improved or expanded. The so-called "barter trade" is trade conducted between governments, which is different in nature from ordinary free private trade and is not bound by any treaty of commerce. Since our country's victory, trade with Japan has been conducted in the form of "barter trade." From last year to the present, Japan's exports to China include logs, railroad ties, rayon, white paper, and locomotives. Rayon alone had a total value of $1,187,967.00 in 1936, and a total value of $1,538,498.19 from January to May of this year. Our country's exports to Japan include salt, wheat bran, pig iron, and phosphates. Salt alone had a total value of $4,349,032.50 in 1936, and a total value of $1,732,465.00 from January to May of this year. Recently, in order to expand trade, the Central Trust Bureau has reached an agreement with MacArthur's headquarters to export 25,000 metric tons of sugar to Japan this year, with a total value of more than $15 million. This shows that the Sino-Japanese barter trade policy is progressing well and has expanded the scope of exchange. If the scope of barter trade is further expanded and improved, it is believed that Sino-Japanese trade before the determination of Japanese reparations and the signing of a peace treaty will not be difficult to implement. We hope that the government will weigh the pros and cons and accept public opinion to make this reasonable and wise decision. It must not blindly drink poison to quench thirst, let alone sharpen the executioner's knife to slaughter its own industry.

However, trade with Japan will inevitably return to normal sooner or later. Therefore, we hope that the government and the business community will broaden their horizons and seize the opportunity to make full preparations before the peace conference is held. Whether it is research and investigation or group action, we should strive to take the initiative in order to be invincible. In particular, our trade policy for the Nanyang market should focus on this. Some people are now advocating amending the international trade system, which is also worth considering. In short, our trade policy should be proactive. Especially for trade with Japan, we need to have prepared and methodical measures, and we must not repeat the situation of panic and lack of responsive measures today.

### Order! Law and Discipline!

Late the day before yesterday, military police and police officers of this city clashed in front of the Jindu Grand Theater over a trivial matter, even using machine guns, causing an unprecedented bloody incident in the city streets. More than a dozen police officers and citizens were killed and injured. When citizens of the entire city saw this shocking news in the newspapers, they all expressed great regret for this unfortunate incident and hoped for an immediate legal solution. However, some police officers actually went on strike yesterday. Fortunately, volunteer police and inspection brigades performed their duties in their place. Otherwise, the city's traffic and public security might have fallen into a state of chaos. Only by evening did they gradually resume their posts. However, yesterday afternoon, the internal equipment of the Jindu Grand Theater was suddenly destroyed, and citizens suffered unexpected losses for no reason. We have three thoughts regarding this unfortunate incident:

First, whether it is the police or the military police, they all represent the state in maintaining local order. Not only is their task important, but their status is also important, so they should be respected by the people. However, in the unfortunate incident that occurred the night before, those who originally intended to maintain order for the theater ended up mutually hindering order, causing panic among the people. Regardless of the cause, the conflict between the police and military police, not in the pursuit of bandits, but actually using machine guns to sweep the streets as if facing a major enemy, is ultimately a phenomenon that people who respect the rule of law are unwilling to see. After the incident, the police and military police authorities researched the cause of the incident. It is said that it was due to the lack of clear division of authority between the police and military police. If the rumor is not groundless, this matter should be quietly awaited for the central government to deal with it according to its wishes. Neither side should take any further action to cause unexpected losses to the citizens. Therefore, we want to ask the police officers who went on strike to fully understand the location of their duties, and should especially focus on local peace and traffic order, fully restore normalcy today, and stay at their posts.

Second, since the victory, the maintenance of public security and order in Shanghai has relied on the efforts of police officers. Although the number of consolation visits from all walks of life in the city during the Spring Festival and the Dragon Boat Festival was not large, it was enough to express the citizens' gratitude to the police and military police. Regardless of how the police and military police seek to divide their limits and how they seek to harmonize their feelings, the first priority should be to respect military law and discipline and maintain order, and to take into account the safety of the people, which is the overall goal of all their work. Local events, the central and local heads in charge, definitely have the necessary responsibility to deal with it according to the law. The unexpected damage suffered by the innocent people should be compensated by the government with responsibility.

Third, Shanghai is China's largest commercial port, and the attention of China and foreign countries is close. The actions of both the government and the people are enough to affect China's reputation and international status. The unfortunate incident the night before cannot but be said to be one of Shanghai's blemishes. We often call for order and law and discipline, and the government also wants everyone to abide by order and law and discipline, but the phenomenon is like this! However, speaking calmly, the formation of this phenomenon does not seem to be the result of one day or two, nor is it unique to the police and military police. Looking around, the facts of obstructing order and destroying law and discipline in society every day are unknown. Over time, it will almost make people feel that "not obeying order is the norm, and respecting law and discipline is the exception," which is a matter of great concern. Therefore, we are willing to speak loudly, not avoiding harsh words, calling on the government and society to learn a lesson from one example and draw inferences about other cases, and everyone to thoroughly reflect, abide by order, and respect law and discipline. All right and wrong should be judged fairly and selflessly before the law!

### Nehru Decides to Refer the Dutch-Indonesian Dispute to the United Nations for Arbitration; Prior Understanding Has Been Reached with the United Kingdom and the United States

[Our News] Guangqiao, New Delhi, 28th: Nehru announced at a special press conference today that within a few hours, he will formally submit the Dutch-Indonesian dispute to the United Nations, requesting the United Nations to immediately stop the Dutch military action in Indonesia. Nehru stated that he had consulted with the United Kingdom and the United States in advance regarding this matter and obtained their sympathy and assistance. Nehru strongly stated that foreign troops must withdraw from Asia. According to reports, the existence of colonial regimes or foreign troops in any Asian country is a direct challenge to Asia. The continued existence of colonies not only threatens peace but also prevents the recovery of the world economy, Nehru claimed in extremely heavy tones. The Dutch's so-called "guard" action is actually a large-scale organized war.

[Our News] London Broadcasting, 28th: Deputy Chairman of the Dutch-Indonesian Provisional Government Nehru decided to submit the Dutch-Indonesian issue to the United Nations on Tuesday. Nehru also announced a ban on Dutch aircraft landing in India and flying over Indian airspace.

[Reuters, Chicago, 28th Dispatch] The Chicago Tribune, the most widely circulated newspaper in the United States, published an editorial today criticizing the United Nations' failure to intervene in the Indonesian issue. It stated that the United States seems to be less able than Asians to recognize obvious facts, which is a noteworthy phenomenon. The announcement that the traditional principles of the United States should also apply to Asia has actually come from Nehru. American officials now seem unable to speak for the most basic principles of justice.

[French News Agency, Canberra, 28th Dispatch] Australian officials stated today that Australia hopes that the Indonesian issue will be resolved in accordance with international plans, but a formal attitude can only be determined after diplomatic efforts have failed. Australia is currently intensifying diplomatic contacts with the United Kingdom, the United States, the Netherlands, and India to seek a peaceful resolution to the Indonesian conflict.

[Central News Agency, London, 27th Dispatch] The Sunday Observer reported today that the United Kingdom will dissuade Australia and India from submitting the Indonesian issue to the United Nations Security Council for discussion. The United Kingdom believes that this action is a waste of time and will be fruitless.

[Reuters, Singapore, 28th Dispatch] An Indonesian army spokesperson stated at the radio review bureau that the Dutch have deployed four divisions and two brigades in the battle of Java, all equipped with new equipment. Indonesia has now begun underground resistance, and many Dutch soldiers have defected with weapons. According to the Republican Gazette, the Indonesian army is advancing eastward to attack San Seron, and the Dutch army is resisting with all its might. The Dutch deployed aircraft and tanks, and used warships to provide artillery support. The Republican Gazette acknowledged that the Tegel Port on the north coast has been occupied by the Dutch army. Fierce battles have also taken place in Shirawi, ten miles south of Tegel.

Fierce Fighting in Eastern Java Unfinished

The Gazette further stated that the fierce fighting in eastern Java has not ended. Eight hundred Dutch troops, under the cover of armored vehicles, attacked Sha Huabo Ladong, southeast of Surabaya, and were repelled by the Republican army.

[United Press, Batavia, 28th Dispatch] The Yogyakarta Radio broadcast today that the Dutch army used paratroopers for the first time in the battle of Java in an attempt to occupy Lamaqiang, twenty of Wanlong's southern viewpoints, but was cleared by the Indonesian army in coordination with the people. The Dutch Eastern Route Army Command predicted that Indonesia could be conquered within a week, but so far, only a few cities have been occupied, and whether they can be maintained is also questionable.

[United Press, Batavia, 27th Dispatch] The Dutch Military Report today announced that the Dutch army has intensified its pressure on western Java, and other troops have rapidly expanded their bridgeheads on the north coast, occupying Tegel Port, 175 miles southeast of Batavia. The Dutch and Indonesians accuse each other of violating international law.

### Indonesian Army Scorch Earth Resistance; Oil Fields in Dutch-Occupied Areas Are on Fire

[United Press, Sumatra Front, 27th Dispatch] The gasoline pool of the Mobil Company in the local area of Bondo Popo was occupied by the Dutch army three days ago and was not damaged. However, it suddenly caught fire and burned, with thick smoke reaching the sky, reaching 4,500 feet, and spreading 50 miles wide. According to a report from the station manager, the oil wells have not yet caught fire, but most of the oil depots are on fire. The most dangerous thing at present is the tortuous small ditch, which is full of gasoline.

[United Press, Palembang, Sumatra, 27th Dispatch] American gasoline industry technicians following the advancing Dutch army arrived at the Mobil gasoline company's oil fields in southern Sumatra on the 26th and worked hard to put out the fire on the 27th. The arsonists are believed to be the saboteurs on the Indonesian side. According to Dutch Air Force officials, according to a report from Dutch reconnaissance aircraft on the 26th, no fire occurred in the oil field area, so the arsonists must be people from the Indonesian side who often sneak into the area at night.

### Heavy Losses; Difficult to Recover

[United Press, Batavia, 27th Dispatch] The Indonesian News Agency announced tonight that the Dutch army used tanks and aircraft to cut off western Java. If it attempts to occupy the area, the Farm and Forestry Union will implement a scorched-earth policy and set fire to all 500 rubber, quinquina, tea, and coffee farms. According to a senior official of the union, once destroyed, if the Dutch want to restore production, they must send 500,000 workers from their own country and operate for more than ten years before they can be effective. "We will not allow the Dutch to harbor the delusion of maintaining the integrity of agriculture and forestry."

[United Press, Batavia, 28th Dispatch] The Dutch military headquarters announced today that the Dutch army in eastern Sumatra has occupied Bato Raja, a wealthy oil-producing area 80 miles southwest of Huhu Port, and the essential coal mine of Bukit Tessa, 20 miles southwest of it, intact and without resistance. The oil field staff stayed behind and were well-behaved towards the Dutch army. When the Indonesian army retreated from Sekajou, about 60 miles northwest of Huge Port, it burned several villages along the way to the ground.

### Dutch Currency Black Market Price Soars

[Reuters, Singapore, 28th Dispatch] Local Chinese merchants expect that after the Dutch take military action in Java, prosperity can be restored, and in the newly occupied areas by the Dutch army, Dutch Gilders can replace Indonesian banknotes and Japanese military tickets. For this reason, the black market price of Gilders here has suddenly soared. Millions of Indonesian banknotes were smuggled from Java to Singapore by Chinese merchants. The official price is eight Malayan dollars per hundred, and the city once rose to eleven.

Jiang will also go to the war zones and war-torn areas to lead medical relief efforts. Furthermore, our consulate in Medan has also been devising ways to provide relief to the overseas Chinese refugees fleeing to that area, and the consulate in Palembang has even dispatched liaison officers to accompany the Dutch troops in their advance to protect the safety of overseas Chinese civilians in place.

### America Refreshes Diplomatic Lineup to Prepare for Diplomatic Warfare Against the Soviet Union

[Central News Agency Washington 27th United Press Dispatch] The United States is preparing to launch a diplomatic war for peace against the Soviet Union. Secretary of State Marshall is currently reorganizing the American diplomatic lineup, eliminating incompetent officials. The number of those appointed for political reasons is unprecedentedly small. Those appointed as diplomats are all career diplomats who have served in important places around the world. The United States will have the strongest diplomatic network in history in the Balkans, Central Europe, and Sweden. In the Middle East, the American diplomatic lineup has already been strengthened. In the areas of China and France, there will be slight changes soon. Marshall is solving this problem with the tactics of the past. He seeks to surround the Soviet Union with the most talented field commanders. This work has not yet been completed, but it is already underway.

According to United Press's investigation, the age of the current American ambassadors and ministers is actually lighter than at any stage in recent times. There are also two tasks being carried out by Marshall within the State Department that are the same as those being carried out for the American diplomatic lineup abroad. The first is that the selection of senior officials within the State Department has been completed, most of whom are career diplomats; the second is the reorganization of the State Department, merging various secretariats, unifying intelligence work, and establishing personnel to formulate long-term plans. Marshall has put general career diplomats at ease, as they had previously thought that Marshall might appoint his former wartime comrades to senior diplomatic posts. According to United Press's statistics, there are a total of 64 American ambassadors and ministers stationed in countries in the Western Hemisphere, 24 in Europe, 12 in the Middle East and Africa, and 7 in the Far East and the Pacific. There are currently four vacancies, namely Iceland, Spain, Bulgaria, and Nicaragua. Among the ambassadors and ministers, 86 are career diplomats, 13 were appointed due to political connections, 4 were military appointees, and 6 were non-career diplomats but with special qualifications. Several of the non-career diplomats were appointed by the late President Roosevelt. The newly appointed non-career diplomats, but with special qualifications and facing arduous tasks, are Ambassador to the United Kingdom Douglas, Ambassador to India Grady, and Ambassador to Poland Griffiths. Marshall emphasizes the positions of all American envoys in Europe, especially those stationed in countries neighboring the Soviet Union. He now needs first-class diplomats to be dispatched to Sweden, because although Sweden is very peaceful, it is currently the best place to probe the Soviet Union. Marshall is now also strengthening the American diplomatic lineup in Berlin. As for the Balkans, United Nations problem expert Dinon has been appointed Ambassador to Yugoslavia. Former Director of the Office of Foreign Affairs of the US State Department, Jay Young, has arrived in Hungary, and former Minister to Hungary, Schoenfeld, has been transferred to Romania. Only Bulgaria is still without a senior American diplomat. Switzerland will also be succeeded as Minister by former Director of the Far East Department of the State Department, Tang Xuande. Although Fan has devoted most of his time to Far Eastern issues, he is generally regarded as one of the most insightful and capable talents in the American diplomatic corps.

### Forrestal Plans the Merger of the Army, Navy, and Air Force

[United Press Washington 28th Dispatch] America's first Secretary of Defense Forrestal began on the 28th to accept the task of merging the Army, Navy, and Air Force under the new bill to unify the armed forces. The Department of Defense organization passed by Congress is only a blueprint, but the heads of the Army and Navy Departments are confident that Forrestal's strong courage will certainly make it all a reality. During Forrestal's planning of the merger, the three departments of the Army, Navy, and Air Force will continue to operate as usual. A Navy Department spokesman said that the date of Forrestal's official swearing-in has not yet been determined. Forrestal's appointment is a guarantee that the Navy will never be taken over by the Army. According to the new law, the Army, Navy, and Air Force departments belong to Forrestal and are in equal positions. Each department has a minister, but only Forrestal is responsible to the cabinet.

### British-Soviet Trade Negotiations Finally Fail, Soviet Government Clarifies Position, Saying the British Side's Tough Attitude Caused the Breakdown

[Agence France-Presse Moscow 27th Dispatch] TASS News Agency recently issued an official communique explaining the reasons for the breakdown of British-Soviet trade negotiations, stating briefly that: the breakdown of British-Soviet trade negotiations should be attributed to the "tough" attitude of the United Kingdom. There are two reasons for the suspension of negotiations:

(1) The United Kingdom is unwilling to bear a definite obligation to supply the Soviet Union with railway tracks, trains, and other industrial products. Since the Soviet Union does not know whether the United Kingdom will fulfill its obligations, it is naturally unwilling to bear any obligations to the United Kingdom. (2) The Soviet Union requested a reduction of 0.2% in the excise tax on the funds lent to the Soviet Union by the United Kingdom in 1914, and requested repayment in installments over 15 years. This is the same convenience that the Soviet Union requested to obtain the same convenience recently given to France by the United Kingdom, but the British delegation refused. Subsequently, in order to hope to reach an agreement, the Soviet Union abandoned its request for repayment in installments, and only requested the United Kingdom to allow the Soviet Union to first pay half of it immediately, and the balance to be repaid within a certain period. The British delegation again stated that it could not accept it, and put forward a counter-proposal, advocating repayment of a quarter of the amount in installments. The Soviet government found this difficult to accept. Foreign news agencies issued a message on the 24th of this month stating that the breakdown of British-Soviet trade negotiations was due to differences of opinion on wheat prices. This statement is not true. The British and Soviet sides have already reached an agreement on wheat prices, which is lower than the wheat prices recently purchased by the United Kingdom from Argentina and the market prices of Canadian wheat.

A Glimpse of British Views

[Agence France-Presse London 27th Dispatch] Regarding the Soviet Union's accusation that the failure of British-Soviet trade negotiations was due to the tough attitude of the United Kingdom, British officials have not yet commented, but according to qualified sources: The failure of British-Soviet trade negotiations is the result of the Soviet Union's refusal to participate in the Marshall Plan for European Recovery. Since the Soviet Union rejected Secretary of State Marshall's proposal, it had no choice but to transport its surplus goods that could be exported to Eastern European countries. Since the Soviet Union decided not to participate in the Marshall Plan for European Recovery, the wheat prices proposed by the Soviet Union and the nature of the various industrial equipment it requested the United Kingdom to supply have undergone significant changes. The failure of the negotiations seemed inevitable at that time.

### Marshall Receives Freedom Award

[United Press New York 28th Dispatch] The Freedom Association announced today that this year's Freedom Award will be awarded to Secretary of State Marshall in commemoration of his aid to the European Recovery Program. The Freedom Association is a people's organization dedicated to peace. The winner of the 1946 award was Baruch, the designer of the Baruch Atomic Plan, which is the basis for American official policy.

### Australian Foreign Minister Again Meets MacArthur, Differing Opinions on Various Issues Regarding Japan

[United Press Tokyo 28th Dispatch] Australian Foreign Minister Evatt will issue a statement on the 30th regarding his discussions with MacArthur on the occupation of Japan and the Japanese peace treaty. It is expected that Evatt will emphasize the common interests between the United States and Australia and express agreement with the basic principles of the occupation policy. According to an Australian source close to Evatt, if the United States and Australia can have peace in this part of the world, and we live together in this area, even if there are differences between the United States, they will certainly be resolved. "There may be differences between the United States and Australia, but there have never been differences between MacArthur and Evatt." Evatt hosted a banquet on the evening of the 28th to entertain American military personnel serving in Australia, and Evatt also had an informal conversation with Australian reporters. Evatt met with MacArthur at his headquarters for two hours on the evening of the 27th, and an Allied Headquarters spokesman said that the meeting was extremely "harmonious" and they were completely in agreement. This was Evatt's first official meeting on his fact-finding visit to Japan. Although American and Australian officials and non-officials would agree, sources close to Evatt said that there were several major differences in their viewpoints.

American personnel will peacefully hand over all executive tasks, and the Korean people will handle state affairs themselves, with the occupying forces only in a supervisory position.

### French Peasant Girl Becomes a Saint, Repeatedly Encountered Miracles During Her Lifetime

### French Left and Right Wings Face Strength Test, De Gaulle Publicly Condemns Communists

[Reuters Liner City, France 27th Dispatch] General de Gaulle, leader of the French People's Rally, has taken another step in his movement to establish a strong democratic government and cooperate fully with the United States, attacking the French Communist Party head-on. Political figures believe that De Gaulle's increasingly open opposition to the French Communists is related to the Soviet Union's refusal to participate in the discussions on the Marshall Plan for European Recovery. De Gaulle bluntly stated that the Soviet Union's policies were astonishing. De Gaulle is already the third French leader in the past 72 hours to express similar astonishment. Former French Prime Minister Reynaud warned on Friday that the choice between "war soon" and "US-Soviet compromise" is not far off. French Foreign Minister Bidault also stated yesterday that the international situation has reached a serious stage, and the French people generally believe that the international situation is currently full of danger. The fact that the National Assembly is not taking its usual summer recess proves this point. De Gaulle's harsh condemnation of the Communist Party and the Soviet Union's hegemony, while at the same time calling on all French people, including "those who have been obeying others until now", foreshadows that France is about to face a split, and the pro-Eastern and pro-Western factions will soon test their strength in reality. This internal strife will be accelerated by the deteriorating economic and financial situation. De Gaulle's visit to the Brittany region has caused a sensation far and wide, with people coming from as far as 300 miles to listen to his speech, which shows that this wartime leader is still deeply supported by the people.

Contents of De Gaulle's Speech

[Associated Press Liner 27th Dispatch] De Gaulle delivered a speech here today, accusing the Soviet Union of creating a world crisis and blaming the French Communist Party for following Moscow's lead. De Gaulle claimed that the Soviet Union has controlled 400 million people in neighboring countries of Spain, Turkey, and Italy, only 500 kilometers from France. The Soviet Union, with its military and economic pressure, and internal personnel colluding in response, has organized totalitarian regimes in Poland, Yugoslavia, Albania, Romania, Hungary, Bulgaria, Prussia, and Saxony, and can manipulate the Czech Republic and Finland.

### Soviet Scientists Discover New Magnetic North Pole

[United Press London 18th Dispatch] According to the Soviet Northern Sea Route Administration, which manages Arctic exploration and navigation, Soviet scientists have discovered a "polar region that cannot be reached by humans", and have studied it, and have also confirmed the existence of the second magnetic pole. The "polar region that cannot be reached by humans" was named by Canadian explorer Stefansson. The area is not affected by stars or geomagnetism, is the farthest from any settlement, and is the most difficult to reach from all parts of the Arctic.

A spokesman for the Polar Institute at Cambridge University said that the area may be around 85 degrees north latitude, and between 130 degrees east longitude and 140 degrees west longitude. Soviet scientists did not precisely specify the position of the pole, but said that an expedition was sent to the area in 1941. According to the survey, the seabed in the "polar region that cannot be reached by humans" is 6,000 to 11,000 feet deep, rather than the previously assumed 21,340 feet. There are small pieces and running water between the big ice islands. This is consistent with previous assumptions. Many explorers have passed through the "polar region that cannot be reached by humans", but so far only the Soviet team has spent several months on the moving ice island, doing scientific research. At the same time, Soviet scientists claimed that the existence of the second magnetic pole has also been confirmed, but they have not announced its precise position.

### Dynamics of the US Congress Under Republican Control

[Central News Agency, Washington, 27th] The Eightieth Congress of the United States concluded its first session today. Although the Congress's actions regarding foreign affairs were unremarkable, they surprised conservative Republicans and deeply rooted isolationists. Republican lawmakers, who gained control of Congress for the first time in sixteen years, were able to cut approximately $2.7 billion from President Truman's proposed $37 billion budget, largely allocated to domestic expenses. However, virtually all requests for US foreign programs were approved.

Bipartisan or non-partisan foreign policy continued to gain strength in this session. Republican leaders continued to urge the United States to take a more active role in world affairs. President Truman's policies and Secretary of State Marshall's proposed European economic recovery plan have become cornerstones of US foreign policy. Despite the existence of Republican policies and isolationist factions, the US Congress continued to support the expenditure of American funds overseas to strengthen democratic forces. However, Congress strived to ensure that US aid was conditional and to reduce any commitments President Truman sought to make.

Under Republican control for the past seven months, the US Congress has shown increasing suspicion of the Soviet Union, especially since Secretary Marshall's return from the Moscow Conference. It has also demonstrated fear of domestic and foreign communism. President Truman's request for Congress to allocate $400 million to prevent the spread of communism in Greece and Turkey was immediately met with a positive response from members of Congress. The $11 million needed to eliminate the Communist Party in the United States under the President's loyalty program was also approved without significant difficulty. Members of Congress continued to show some progress in their postwar worldviews.

Congress is now resolutely supporting Marshall's firm and humble attitude, and the policy of vigorously promoting postwar world reconstruction, regardless of whether the Soviet Union participates. Although Congress refused to accept a large number of European displaced persons into the United States over a four-year period, it allocated $75 million to alleviate Europe's needs.

Half of all proposals from the US State Department were accepted. However, the most serious blow it suffered was Congress's rejection of Secretary Marshall's request to establish permanent overseas intelligence operations. Congress only approved $12 million to fund foreign broadcasting and propaganda programs. According to congressional records, the United States has provided nearly $20 billion in aid to 59 countries worldwide over the past two years.

Another noteworthy fact about Congress is its great concern for European issues, while it has not discussed or made decisions on the major issue of China.

The major debate on the Marshall Plan in the next session of Congress will depend on developments in Europe. If the international situation becomes critical, Congress may reconvene before January. The biggest foreign issue the next session will face remains the Soviet Union, and the growing awareness that the world has divided into two spheres: the Soviet Union and the Western democracies.

The next Congress will also make a decision on the plan to standardize and cooperate on Pan-American armaments, which will be discussed at the Rio de Janeiro Conference on August 15th. Given Congress's anti-communist tendencies, the Western Hemisphere defense plan is likely to pass without any amendments.

### Serious British Economic Crisis: Articles Urging Prime Minister Attlee's Resignation Appear; British Prime Minister to Report on Governance

[United Press, London, 28th] The "Daily Mirror," known for its pro-socialist stance, published an editorial today calling for Prime Minister Attlee to resign, claiming that if he does not step down voluntarily, a majority of members of Parliament will force him out of office. This shows that the increasing economic crisis in Britain is causing widespread anxiety. At the same time, newspapers of various political persuasions, from the Communist Party to the Conservative Party, are criticizing the cabinet, with the exception of the Liberal Party's "Daily News Chronicle," though even it is not defending the government as strongly as in the past.

[United Press, London, 27th] Prime Minister Attlee, at the request of Labour Party members, is scheduled to address a special closed-door meeting of Labour MPs on Wednesday to report on the progress of leading the country. Newspapers today published headlines warning from party leaders that Britain's coal shortage and the scarcity of other essential goods remain extremely serious. Unless a miracle occurs, the British people will suffer hunger and cold this winter, and perhaps for years to come. On the international front, Britain's influence has already withdrawn from India, Burma, and Greece, and it will have to further reduce its military strength and other burdens.

### Question of Organizing a Korean Provisional Government: The US Disagrees with Soviet Proposal; North Korean Refugees Fleeing into the US-Occupied Zone

[Associated Press, Seoul, 28th] According to General Brown, the US-Soviet Joint Commission has encountered some difficulties because the Soviet side opposes including former members of the so-called Anti-Trusteeship Committee in the provisional government. The American representatives cannot agree to rescind the cooperation declaration, which would deny a portion of important figures representing Korean public opinion. Brown continued, stating that the opinion of the American delegation is that government belongs to the people, which means that it belongs to all the people and all political parties formed by the people. To deny a large number of people and the political parties that represent them the right to participate in the most important things they encounter in their lives, namely, not allowing them to participate in the formation of their government, would be unjust, which is something the American delegation cannot agree to.

[Associated Press, Seoul, 28th] US military commanders in Japan stated that Korea is a troublesome place in the East. Reporters understood this after arriving in Seoul, as communists are about to launch a revolution in the US-occupied zone. If this happens, US occupation forces will inevitably engage in war with the communists, and the outcome is unpredictable. This is why Lieutenant General Hodge, the commander of US occupation forces, does not encourage family members to come, and repeatedly tells his subordinates not to do so. In short, the Korean problem is how to return Korea to the Koreans to manage themselves, without it becoming a vassal state of the Soviet Union. Since the US and the Soviet Union separately occupied the north and south of Korea, no agreement has ever been reached on the Korean issue, resulting in a deadlock. It is rumored that the Soviet Union has organized North Korea into a vassal state, and has sent thousands of long-trained communists to infiltrate the US-occupied zone, in order to unite with 20,000 local comrades to incite incidents. In addition, "refugees" from the Soviet-occupied zone are fleeing into this area every day. The US military authorities now believe that these people are likely to incite revolution.

### Irgun Calls on Jews to Launch a Campaign of Disobedience; British Forces Continue to Intercept Jewish Immigrant Ships

[Agence France-Presse, Jerusalem, 27th] The Jewish terrorist organization Irgun broadcasted today, calling on the Jewish people to launch a campaign of disobedience against the British authorities. The Irgun demands that the Jewish people take the following actions: (1) Refuse to pay taxes, (2) Refuse to recognize British courts and organize their own courts, (3) Treat British laws as invalid, (4) Break off all contact with the British authorities.

[Reuters, Haifa, 28th] The Jewish refugee ship "Return Home," carrying 400 unauthorized Jewish immigrants, has approached the port of Haifa. A squadron of armored vehicles from the British 6th Airborne Division is patrolling the streets of Haifa. The Jewish area of Mount Carmel in Haifa has been sealed off, and British soldiers on alert have been ordered to prepare for any eventuality. According to Jewish sources, another Jewish refugee ship, the "Victim," carrying 700 Jews, is sailing behind "Return Home" towards Palestine. Officials announced that the refugees on both ships will be sent to Cyprus. Officials are keeping the circumstances of the Navy's interception of the two ships a secret.

### Central Military Police Officials Come to Shanghai to Thoroughly Investigate Responsibility for the Golden Theater Bloodshed; Military, Police, and Military Police Organize Investigation Committee to Jointly Handle; Police Post Resumption Partially Restored in the Afternoon

[Report from Our Newspaper] The Garrison Command is taking the military police conflict and bloodshed incident at the Golden Theater very seriously. Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, Commander Xuan, accompanied by Police Chief Yu Shuping, Deputy Chief Zhang Shi, Inspector General Zhang Da, and others, personally went to the New City Branch to persuade police officers not to take excessive actions and to resume their work. At the same time, in order to investigate the truth and prevent the situation from escalating, an investigation committee was organized by the Garrison Command, the Police Department, and the Military Police Regiment. The Garrison Command sent Chief of the Inspection Department Tao Yishan, the Police Department sent Deputy Chief Zhang Shi, and the Military Police Regiment sent Regiment Commander Wu Guangyun. The three held a preliminary consultation at Tao Yishan's residence at 12:30 PM, and decided that the principle was to not allow the incident to escalate, investigate the truth, and handle it impartially. The three parties also each sent two staff members to conduct further investigations to determine who was responsible. The military police platoon leader Li Yutai who caused the incident and other relevant military police have been detained by the 23rd Military Police Regiment, and the police officers who were injured or killed in the bloodshed will receive preferential compensation. Because Commander Xuan believed that the case was of great importance and he needed to be fair with his judgement, he has telegraphed the Ministry of National Defense to send high-ranking officials to Shanghai to preside over the resolution.

According to a statement issued by Commander Xuan: he has not yet relinquished his concurrent position as police chief, so even if he handles the matter impartially, it would inevitably be said that he is biased. Therefore, he has specifically requested the Ministry of National Defense and the Military Police Headquarters to quickly send senior officials to Shanghai to investigate and handle the matter. Yu Shuping has also telegraphed the National Police Agency to send personnel to Shanghai. It is now known that the Military Police Headquarters and the National Police Agency have already dispatched high-ranking officials, who left Beijing by car on the evening of the 28th and are expected to arrive in Shanghai on the morning of the 29th. They will work with Shanghai to conduct an investigation and then study a handling method in order to achieve a satisfactory resolution.

The police were quite agitated yesterday morning, forming a situation of striking posts, and a small number gathered at the Golden Theater, destroying the interior equipment of the theater. After Commander Xuan gave a lecture at the New City Branch in the morning, Chief Yu Shuping also tried his best to persuade and stop them. At 2:00 PM, Mayor Wu, accompanied by Deputy Chief Zhang Shi, went to the New City Branch again to advise the police officers to focus on maintaining order. At the same time, after hearing about the incident, the Ministry of Interior in Nanjing urgently telegraphed the municipal government to quickly seek a resumption of work. After 3:00 PM, the road posts gradually resumed partially. In order to maintain public order and prevent criminals from taking advantage of the situation, the Garrison Command dispatched all nine inspection brigades and the first and second volunteer inspection brigades to patrol key areas. Traffic on all roads was maintained by police officers and volunteer police dispatched by the General Bureau.

Military Police Regiment Issues Statement on the Incident

The 23rd Military Police Regiment sent letters to various newspapers yesterday, publishing the following account of the bloodshed incident: "At around 10:00 PM the previous night, six military police officers from the 8th Company of the Military Police Corps on Kangding Road, on orders, went to the Golden Theater to inspect military discipline. Because a conflict arose between a customer buying a ticket and an employee of the Golden Theater, the military police team went forward to mediate and had a misunderstanding with police officer number 6588. Another military police team led by Platoon Leader Li Yutai also went to the Golden Theater to inspect, and Li and the police officer had a quarrel that escalated into a fight. Other military police officers then struck the police officer with their rifle butts. At this time, Chen Fan, an officer attached to the headquarters of the Military Police Corps, along with six soldiers, passed by the Golden Theater and went forward to mediate. Police officer 6588 claimed to have been seriously injured, but Officer Chen personally inspected him and did not see any serious injuries. At the time, Chen notified Zhuo Qingbao, the chief of the New City Branch, by telephone, and agreed to send police officer 6588 to the hospital for treatment, with the military police responsible for the medical expenses. Chief Zhuo of the branch expressed his agreement and guaranteed that the incident would not escalate. After ten minutes, Section Chief Gu of the branch came to the Golden Theater. After discussions between the two sides, the incident was resolved.

Unarmed Police Surrounded Regiment

Unexpectedly, when Platoon Leader Li Yutai left the Golden Theater, he was surrounded by more than 100 plainclothes police officers. Li and others retreated to the third floor of the Golden Theater and notified the company headquarters and the chief of the New City Branch by telephone. Before long, Company Commander Wang and Deputy Chief Xia of the New City Branch rushed to the Golden Theater, but were still unable to resolve the situation. At this time, Deputy Chief Xia and the military police were on the third floor of the Golden Theater, and unexpectedly a truck of military police officers from the Military Affairs Team of the Military Police Corps on Kaina Road, heading from east to west, was surrounded by hundreds of police officers due to a misunderstanding. The military police officers in the truck, seeing the situation and the fact that the hundreds of police officers were not in uniform, immediately jumped out of the truck and lay down on the ground. Company Commander Ren Yafu, who was on the truck, only understood the truth of the incident after questioning. At this time, it was already close to 11:00 PM, and coincidentally a truck full of watermelons was driving from west to east. The police officers stopped the truck from moving forward, and gunfire began at this time. The first bullet struck the white jeep of the US military police joint patrol team. The two American military police officers and our military police officer immediately jumped out and lay down. Gunfire gradually became denser."

The Mystery of the First Shot

Therefore, the Military Police Regiment believes that there should be a fair investigation into who fired the first shot, which caused the large-scale conflict. However, according to Zhang Shi, the deputy chief of the Police Department, the department has sent Lu Dagong, the chief of the security guard office, to investigate with the US-China military police team, but there was no such thing, and the shell casings found at the scene of the incident were all rifle bullets and Thomson submachine gun bullets. It is now up to the investigation team to rigorously investigate who should be held responsible.

Police Firearms are Registered

According to Zhuo Qingbao, the chief of the New City Police Branch, "If it is said that the police fired the first shot, it is not true, because the firearms and ammunition issued to the police on duty must be returned to the armory when they leave. Even if one bullet is fired, it must be reported truthfully. All firearms and ammunition in the bureau are registered in a register." He also said, "The dozens of shell casings recovered this time were all from Thomson submachine guns, rifles, and 'Type 38' rifles. All the ones owned by the police station are 'Type 38' pistols."

### Deputy Commander of Military Police States: Plainclothes Police Had Firearms

[Central News Agency Report] Liu Conglong, the deputy commander of the 23rd Military Police Regiment, made the following three points in response to the police department's claim that all plainclothes police officers were not carrying firearms: (1) The plainclothes police officers had no task to go to the Golden Theater, so there was no need to send more than 200 people. (2) The regiment recovered six Browning bullet casings, but the regiment did not have such firearms. (3) At dawn, it was discovered that all the plainclothes police officers were equipped with firearms. Also, at around 00:30, US Navy military police officer Parker was driving a jeep from the west when he was ordered to stop by plainclothes police. The US military police officer ignored the order, and two shots were fired from behind. One bullet hit the windshield of the jeep. After that, gunfire erupted everywhere. The US military police officer went to the Military Police Regiment on the 28th to talk and made a statement, proving that the bullets that hit the car were fired from a Browning pistol, and proving that they were fired by plainclothes police officers.

### City Council Sends Members to Investigate

The City Council is extremely concerned about this incident. Yesterday afternoon, Speaker Pan entrusted councilors Hou Jiyuan, Fei Shusheng, Zhang Zhongyuan, Zhang Naizuo, and others to go to the Police Department and the 23rd Military Police Regiment to inquire about the incident, and hoped that the police would first resume their posts. Both sides emphasized the safety of citizens and social order, and jointly sought a fair resolution according to the law.

### Chief Prosecutor Huang States: No Comments

[Report from Our Newspaper] Last night, reporters visited Huang Liang, the chief prosecutor of the local court in this city, to inquire about the attitude of the prosecutor's office towards the Golden Theater bloodshed. According to him, the prosecutor's office has not received any report on the case, and only knows a little about it from the newspapers. Military police officers are active-duty soldiers and are not under the jurisdiction of the court. Police officers are civil servants of the municipal government. If they have illegal or improper actions, or if victims come to file a lawsuit, the prosecutor's office will of course accept it and investigate it according to legal procedures. As for this case, I currently have no comments.

### Funeral Expenses for Six Deceased Police Officers Exceed 40 Million

[Report from Our Newspaper] In addition to Guo Shimin, the street vendor who was killed by a stray bullet and whose body has been claimed by his family for coffin preparation, the bodies of six others, including police cadet Shi Wenbiao, were sent to the central funeral home on Ma Bai Road yesterday evening for encoffining. The ceremony was presided over by Chief Yu and was simple and solemn, with more than a thousand guests attending, demonstrating great honor. According to Director Sun Jialiang, the cost of the clothing, coffins, and other funeral arrangements for the six police officers totaled more than 40 million, which was allocated by the municipal government. A special condolence payment of 20 million per person was requested by the police department.

### Vengeance and Justice Society Issues Fourteen Demands

[Report from Our Newspaper] The "7/27 Bereaved Comrades Seeking Justice and Vengeance Aftermath Handling Committee" of the Municipal Police Department yesterday issued fourteen demands for the authorities to accept. The original text is as follows: (1) Demand the execution of the violent and secretive bandit Li Yutai. (2) Severely punish Military Police Officer Chen and the military police officer who caused the disaster. (3) The funeral arrangements for the deceased should be generously handled by the funeral home, and the injured should be treated quickly. (4) The families of the victims should be notified and generously compensated. (5) Hold a memorial meeting, and expand the memorial.

(8) We want to take three days off to assist in handling the aftermath (definitely not a strike). (9) Request severe punishment for the manager of the Golden Theater who was an accomplice. (10) Demand the punishment of those responsible for improper handling of the situation. (11) Request a delineation of the powers of the military police and police, and ask the military police to stay in their own positions. (12) Please have the military police pay attention to academic training and legal training, so that they have some "compassion". (13) Please do not be alarmed by these supportive classmates. We are all driven by sympathy and an ignited sense of righteousness. (14) Please have the Military Police Regiment guarantee that similar incidents will not happen again in the future.

### Military Police Ordered to Partially Strike

On the military police side, in order to avoid further unfortunate events after the conflict, the 23rd Military Police Regiment was ordered on the 28th to partially strike work, stay in the barracks, and await the resolution of the incident.

### Traffic Unmanned: Cars Becoming as Slow as Oxen

Street Gossip

[Report from Our Newspaper] The shops and residents along Fuxu Road and Tongfu Road suffered a great shock the night before, and the aftershocks are still present. Yesterday, whenever military police officers were seen passing by, they ran to avoid them. Nearby shops were closed all day, and residents used the case as a topic of conversation, discussing it a lot. In particular, watermelon vendors and soda vendors described their experiences and eyewitness accounts in vivid detail, attracting many passersby to stop and listen. Although military police officers in yellow uniforms appeared from time to time in the streets and at the Golden Theater, traffic at the crossroads was unmanned, and vehicles came and went, competing for the lead, creating a chaotic order. At the same time, traffic throughout the city was also chaotic due to the lack of police officers directing traffic, causing road congestion and cars to move as slowly as oxen, giving the feeling of "I can't go, brother."

### Eight Dead, Eight Injured: A List; Three Military Police Officers Also Injured

[Report from Our Newspaper] It has been learned that the deceased police cadet Shi Wenbiao, number 693, had a gunshot wound to his abdomen. Que Shaowu, number 6868, had a bullet to the head. Zhang Gong, number 4931, had an abdominal wound with intestines coming out. (The above three police officers are all from the Old Concession Police Bureau). Li Zhengguang, number 4391, had his skull shattered, which was a terrible sight. Yang Zuda, number 6237, had injuries to his head and face. (The above two police officers are from the New City Branch). Xu Fengkui, number 6681, had a bullet wound to the chest, and was a police cadet from the Huangpu Bureau. In addition, pedestrian Guo Fumin, a street vendor, 18 years old, from Beixinjing, was also killed by a stray bullet. As for the injured police cadets and pedestrians, they are Li Shijie, number 6540, Lu Yunheng, number 6588, Xu Jianping, number 5940 (all from the New City Branch).

It is also known that Zhou Jinqi, number 6783, a police cadet from the Old Concession Branch, also died in the hospital at 1:14 AM this morning. As for the military police, according to Liu Conglong, the deputy commander of the 23rd Regiment, three were also injured, and their names are as follows: Li Yutai, Yang Guichu, and Yang Xie Kai.

### Distribution of Oil to Industrial Workers to be Implemented Before August 10th

[Report from this Newspaper] Ji Mingzhai, the Chief of the Food Section of the Social Affairs Bureau, went to the Central Bank at 3:00 PM yesterday to discuss the distribution of oil to industrial workers in the city with President Zhang. The result was very satisfactory. The first phase of oil distribution can be implemented before August 10th, with each person receiving two catties per month, priced at 4,500 yuan per catty for this phase.

The main points, as learned, are: (1) The distribution target is limited to industrial workers currently working in factories.

(3) For distribution procedures, factories only need to submit the food allocation form number and payment receipt number to the Civil Food Allocation Committee; there is no need to create a roster again. (4) Payment must be made to the designated bank.

### Jin Du Theater Destroyed for the Third Time, Engineer's Whereabouts Unknown, Cinema Association Issues Written Statement

[Report from this Newspaper] Regarding the destruction of the Jin Du Grand Theater yesterday, the Cinema Association issued a written statement, which reads: "According to the Jin Du Grand Theater's report, at about 9:30 PM on the 27th of this month, three audience members with two tickets attempted to enter the theater, but were politely refused by the ticket collector, leading to a dispute. A military police officer on duty at the scene mediated. Another police officer in the theater also came to mediate. It is unknown how a misunderstanding occurred, followed by a fight. The police officer then left angrily. The theater was fortunate that nothing happened. However, soon after, a large group of police officers came to the theater, with a threatening momentum. Because the theater was full, for the safety of over a thousand audience members, the iron gates were closed for isolation, which is the only method used by theaters to prevent incidents and protect the audience. At that time, the noise outside the theater was chaotic, and the crowd grew larger and larger. It was impossible to distinguish between soldiers, police, and civilians. The stalemate lasted until about 12:30 AM, when gunshots suddenly rang out, intermittently, until about 2:30 AM. Fortunately, responsible leaders arrived, and the situation calmed down. The truth and falsehood have been investigated by the responsible authorities and will soon be clarified. Unexpectedly, at about 11:00 AM, 1:00 PM, and 4:30 PM today (the 28th), the theater was destroyed by dozens of police officers in trucks. The employees in the theater were brutally beaten, and an engineer who came to inspect the air conditioning equipment was taken away and his whereabouts are still unknown. All the theater's assets were destroyed. The theater suffered an unexpected disaster due to a conflict involving military police, which is deeply regrettable. For the survival of the industry and the safety of the audience, the association will continue to demand the punishment of the perpetrators. Also, in the afternoon of the same day, dozens of police officers in trucks went to various theaters and ordered the removal of the original military police seats. Fortunately, the theaters handled it properly, and no incidents occurred. The association believes that the main cause of this unfortunate incident is the unclear division of responsibilities between the police and the military. This has been fully explained to Director Yu of the Police Bureau. We dare not judge who is right and who is wrong, but the destruction of Jin Du Theater three times today is truly chilling to the industry. Therefore, in addition to requesting the authorities to provide effective protection and compensation for all the damages suffered by Jin Du, we also demand the prompt punishment of the perpetrators and the adoption of effective measures to prevent similar incidents from happening again. Otherwise, the members of the association, for the safety of the audience and their own survival, will be forced to close down completely."

Equipment Completely Destroyed, Film Strips Fly Like Butterflies

According to news from the Cinema Business Association: According to reports received by the association, Jin Du was destroyed several times yesterday, with the last time ending at 4:30 PM. Afterwards, the Garrison Command sent a team to guard the theater, and peace was restored. However, at that time, all the equipment inside the theater had been completely destroyed. Even the large glass windows outside the theater, the neon lights, and the pair of large candles from the "Dragon and Phoenix Candles" advertisement were not spared. During the destruction, all the film strips of "Dragon and Phoenix Candles" were thrown out of the windows and into the street one after another. Passersby scrambled to pick them up and watch them, creating a very chaotic situation. Someone on the roof threw accumulated firewood from a high altitude, causing the neon lights to be "smashed to pieces."

Tea Boys Escape Over the Roof

At that time, three tea boys escaped by climbing over the roof, but employees Zeng Tingjie and petitioning police officer Yu Naimiao were reported missing. Also, Zhang Yonggen, the inspector who was in charge at the time of the dispute the previous night, has been summoned by the Police Headquarters for interrogation. Therefore, it is difficult for others to guess the truth of the matter at that time. Liu Heqing, the manager of the theater, went to the First Brigade of Inspectors to report the incident at about 10:00 AM this morning and was still waiting for interrogation in the team tonight.

The detailed situation of Jin Du's losses is difficult to calculate in practice because no one dared to enter for detailed investigation after the incident. However, according to people in the theater, if everything was destroyed, the amount of loss would be around 4 to 5 billion.

### If There is No Proper Solution, Closure Will Be Considered

[Report from this Newspaper] According to Liang Qitian, Chairman of the Cinema Association, the only hope of the association in the future is to ensure the safety of merchants and civilians. If the authorities have no proper solution in the short term, the city's theaters will inevitably consider closing down. The association will visit the Mayor today to express their concerns.

### High Court Asks the Ministry of Justice to Explain Ambiguities in Martial Law

[Report from this Newspaper] After receiving applications for habeas corpus from the families of arrested students, the High Court sent a letter to the Songhu Garrison Command for inquiry.

### Cinemas Showing Four Shows a Day, No Reason to Raise Prices Again

Police Bureau Sends Letter to Social Affairs Bureau [Report from this Newspaper] The matter of raising movie ticket prices is still under review by the Social Affairs Bureau. Yesterday, the Police Bureau sent another letter to the Social Affairs Bureau, stating that the cinemas now show four shows a day and are often full. The first-run cinemas earn tens of millions of yuan per day, so there is no reason to raise prices again.

### Thinking Irrationally in Confinement, Traitors Hope for Cold Drinks to Relieve the Heat, Sternly Rejected and Dejected

For several days, the weather in the city has been scorching hot. The 452 traitors, both convicted and awaiting trial, detained in the Tilanqiao High Court Detention Center, cannot bear the suffering of being imprisoned in the hot summer. A few days ago, they jointly petitioned Warden Shan, requesting permission to go out of prison every night to cool off and to allow family members to send in watermelons, ice blocks, soda, Coca-Cola, and other seasonal thirst-quenching items to relieve the summer heat. Warden Shan stated that according to prison regulations, prisoners are not allowed to enjoy luxury goods that are not necessities of life. Except for bananas and apples, which are helpful for health and disease resistance, and are allowed to be sent in by family members as before, all other unreasonable demands of the prisoners are sternly rejected. The prisoners were greatly disappointed upon hearing the news and were dejected for a long time. Imagining them looking at the night sky through the windows, silently recalling their dreamlike luxury, they must have felt unbearable suffering.

Pan Gongzhan explained that disaster relief is like fighting a fire, and there is no time to delay. Funds should be raised immediately to provide emergency relief. Xu Jiyun's opinion was that overall planning is necessary before distributing the funds, and that emergency needs should be met by advance payments from all parties, while slower aspects should be addressed by selling lottery tickets. Qian Xinzi stated that the disaster in Guangdong and Guangxi was severe and that people should sympathize. In order to strengthen the committee's work, he believed that standing committee members should be added to handle regular work to promote the effort. Yang Dezhao, Secretary General of the Committee, Dong Hefu, a representative of the paper merchants, Wang Xiaolai, Chairman of the Commercial and Vocational Association, and Luo Qinghua and Xi Yushu also expressed their opinions.

Regarding the first item, raising funds takes time, but disaster relief cannot be delayed. It is planned to borrow 10 billion yuan from the national banks, bureaus, and treasury for advance payment, guaranteed by himself and the five deputy chairmen. Regarding the second item, it must first be submitted to the government for approval before a decision can be made. Song then announced that a meeting would be held this morning at the Bank of China Building to discuss the appointment of standing committee members in order to promote fundraising efforts.

### Mayser Suffers Illness in Prison, High Court Rules for Release on Bail, Left Detention Center Yesterday for Treatment at Hong En Hospital

[Report from this Newspaper] Mayser, the "Foreign Tiger" in the financial disruption case, was sentenced to one year of imprisonment by both the District Court and the High Court. The case is currently in the third instance at the Supreme Court. Mayser is detained in the District Court Detention Center on Sinan Road. The defense lawyer has applied to the High Court and the Supreme Court to stop the detention, but both were rejected. However, the Supreme Court's ruling stated that "Regarding the claim that he is currently suffering from illness, since it was not mentioned to the original court, suddenly making an empty claim to this court is clearly improper." Based on this point, the defense lawyer argued that Mayser suffers from severe neurological illness, nasal ulcers, lymphatic gland inflammation, and insomnia, and applied for cessation of detention based on Article 114, Paragraph 1, Item 3 of the Criminal Procedure Law, which states "if the detainee is currently suffering from an illness that may not be treated due to detention." The High Court sent personnel to investigate and confirmed that Mayser was indeed suffering greatly from illness in the detention center, and therefore ruled in favor of the application. He was ordered to pay a cash bail of 100 million legal currency and provide a guarantee from a reputable shop, readily available for call. After the defense lawyer completed the procedures, Mayser was released from the District Court Detention Center and taken to Hong En Hospital for treatment.

### Fish Vendor Prosecuted for Fraud

[Report from this Newspaper] The Fish Vendor Mao Jiasheng was prosecuted for fraud yesterday by the District Prosecutor's Office. According to the indictment: Mao, who is a fish vendor, issued two bad checks totaling 13 million legal currency on May 14th and 15th of this year, and defrauded the Jicheng Fish Shop of 197 loads of salted yellow croaker, valued at 26,486,650 yuan. After Zheng Baokang of the shop discovered this, he reported it to the Wusong Police Station, who sent Mao Jiasheng to the District Prosecutor's Office for investigation. Mao argued: "Because I lost money selling fish, I did not pay the money." It was found that the money of the defendant in the Hongkou branch of the Zhejiang Industrial Bank was less than 13 million yuan, but he privately issued a check of 13 million yuan. He has admitted that he bought the fish, and then sold it again and did not pay. Even if his losses are true, he should have explained it to the plaintiff, but he secretly hid it elsewhere. His suspicion of using bad checks to defraud the plaintiff of yellow croaker cannot be said to be small. His actions constitute the crimes of Article 339, paragraph 1 of the Criminal Law and Article 136, paragraph 2 of the Negotiable Instruments Law, and a public prosecution is filed in accordance with the law.

### Gold Rush Case: Two Defendants, Zhan Sheng Applies for Retrial

[Our Newspaper's Report] In the Gold Rush case, the defendant Zhan Liansheng, Chairman of the Shanghai Gold Firms Association, was previously sentenced to four years of imprisonment by the District Court. Zhan's defense lawyer yesterday submitted a petition to the court for a retrial. The grounds for appeal stated that the defendant was unaware of the National Bank's gold reserves and therefore could not speculate. The original judgment stated that the defendant was fully aware of the National Bank's storage and sales situation, and therefore could control the industry and take advantage of opportunities for profit, which was fabricated and did not correspond to the facts. The defendant only represented the members to apply to the National Bank for the purchase of openly allocated gold bars in his capacity as Chairman of the Trade Association. The secret sale part, not only did not represent the members, but even the secret sale part of the same Fengyu Gold Firm, was the responsibility of Manager Ying Minghe.

Another defendant in the case, Yang Anren, former Deputy Director of the Business Bureau of the National Bank, who was sentenced to seven years in prison, also applied to the District Court for a retrial, but the detailed reasons have not yet been submitted to the District Court.

### Hang Jiaoci Hosted Local Reporters Yesterday, Elucidating the Significance of Reorganizing Jiaotong University

The Jiaotong University Reorganization Committee Resolved Yesterday: Based on the Three Principles of "Fairness," "Generosity," and "Speed," Reorganization will be Completed Within One Month, and a New President Will Be Appointed.

[Our Newspaper's Report] After Jiaotong University President Wu Baofeng's resignation was approved, the Ministry of Education organized a Reorganization Committee composed of nine members, including three Ministry of Education officials: Hang Liwu, Vice Minister of Education, Counselor Xiang Jutan, and Dan Yin Xun; five from the Alumni Association: Mao Yisheng, President of Beiyang Institute of Technology (also Secretary of the Committee), Zhao Zengjue, Director of the Shanghai Public Utilities Bureau, Zhao Zukang, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Works Bureau, Zhou Ren, Director of the Engineering Research Institute of the Academia Sinica, and Zhou Junshi, President of the National Wusong Merchant Marine Academy; and Gu Yiyu, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau. Vice Minister Hang served as the Chairman of the Committee. Yesterday morning at 9:00 am, the Reorganization Committee held its first meeting at the Academia Sinica, resolving to complete the reorganization within one month based on the three principles of "fairness," "generosity," and "speed," and to appoint a new president. It also hired nine faculty and staff members from the university to form a University Affairs Committee, responsible for the daily affairs of the university and implementing the resolutions of the Reorganization Committee. The selection of the nine members of the University Affairs Committee is still under negotiation and will be decided soon. It was also decided that the Reorganization Committee would be dissolved after the new president is announced. Vice Minister Hang was unable to stay in Shanghai for a long time due to his ministerial duties. During his absence from Shanghai, Secretary Mao Yisheng will act as Chairman.

Reorganization Work: Emphasis on Positivity Over Negativity

Yesterday at 5:00 pm, Vice Minister Hang Liwu, along with Mao Yisheng and Zhao Zengjue, hosted reporters from various newspapers at the Academia Sinica. During the event, Vice Minister Hang stated that after 1840, our country felt the need to rely on new education to invigorate and strengthen itself due to the oppression of foreign powers. However, at that time, emphasis was placed on dialect education and military preparation. It was not until the Sino-Japanese War in 1895 that we felt that if we wanted to become strong, we could not only rely on dialect and military preparation education. So, we established practical science education and founded Beiyang University and Nanyang University. Later, Nanyang University evolved into Jiaotong University. Therefore, Jiaotong University is actually the beginning of practical science education in modern Chinese educational history. It has a history of more than 50 years and has been managed by many people. The academic atmosphere has always been very pure, and the academic standards are also high. Graduates have made great contributions to the country's transportation construction. However, since the restoration, the school's discipline has become increasingly lax due to the instigation of a small number of students.

The last semester was particularly bad. Classes were only held for six weeks, and the semester's coursework could not be completed. Recently, during the holidays, hundreds of students from outside the school mixed into the campus to live, organize groups, and publish publications, going beyond normal practices. Parents of students and people from all walks of life complained, and even teachers, staff, and outstanding students within the school felt the need for improvement. President Wu Baofeng resigned four times, and the Ministry of Education had no choice but to approve his resignation. Before the new president is announced, a Reorganization Committee has been specially organized to be responsible for rectification. Based on the three principles of "fairness," "generosity," and "speed," we seek active improvement and take effective measures to restore normalcy as soon as possible and maintain past reputation. The reorganization work emphasizes positivity over negativity. Its purpose is to cherish the past history of Jiaotong University and enable it to develop further in the future. I believe that the current faculty and staff, in order to protect the school, will be able to cooperate and overcome difficulties together. And most students, especially those who are usually excellent, do not need to be suspicious or fearful. This reorganization work will not shake the foundation of Jiaotong University itself, but anything that hinders the future development of the school will be removed. The current Reorganization Committee is clearing a path so that the new president can develop the school and make Jiaotong University the highest institution of transportation engineering in the country.

Members of the Reorganization Committee Will Not Serve as President in the Future

Mao Yisheng continued: The Reorganization Committee is a transitional organization after President Wu's resignation and before the new president is announced. Its task is to maintain and improve. Alumni participating in the Reorganization Committee have an unshirkable duty to protect the school. Minister Zhu once stated that the Reorganization Committee can participate in the selection of the new president, so it is also the new president's trial selection committee. However, members participating in the Reorganization Committee only contribute opinions and do not serve as president.

[Another Report] Vice Minister Hang came to Shanghai to handle the work of Jiaotong University, and it has come to an end. He took the train back to Beijing last night.

Reorganization Time: Estimated to be at Least One Month

[Another Report] According to a member of the Jiaotong University School Affairs Reorganization Committee yesterday, the committee will conduct necessary and reasonable reorganization of the school based on the principle of fairness and generosity. This reorganization includes many aspects, roughly including: (1) Conducting a general registration of students and submitting the registers to the Ministry; (2) Taking action against students with poor academic performance; (3) Requiring all non-Jiaotong University students to move out of the school; (4) Adjusting school personnel as appropriate; (5) Internal reorganization of the school, which is particularly important. The person in charge also stated that the reorganization time is expected to be at least one month. During the reorganization period, general school affairs will proceed as usual. Also: Jiaotong University Dean of the College of Engineering Qiu Weiyu, Professor Zhou Ming, and Director of General Affairs Ji Wenmei visited Hang at the Academia Sinica at 10:00 am yesterday during the first meeting of the Jiaotong University School Affairs Reorganization Committee chaired by Vice Minister Hang, and had friendly discussions on the reorganization opinions of the school.

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Ministry of Education's first self-funded student examination was held in Chongqing in 1932, and more than 30 groups of students were admitted in liberal arts, science, law, business, agriculture, engineering, and medicine, totaling more than 327 students, who were quite selected at the time. At that time, the war situation was critical, the rear was tight, and the allied countries had quite a bit of criticism of our government. All the students were ordered by the government to postpone their departure, but most of them were civil servants and teachers, and they had resigned from their original positions to go to Chongqing to apply for departure procedures. Among them, many sold their clothes or borrowed from relatives and friends to plan for the departure expenses, which at that time only required 100,000 legal tender. After this obstacle, they were trapped in the capital, facing a dilemma. Before long, the international situation improved, the ban on students going abroad was lifted, and they hurriedly handled the departure procedures, flew to India, transferred to the United Kingdom and the United States, and entered various famous university graduate schools for research. After two and a half years, our country won the victory and recovered its territory, and these students also completed their studies one after another. The person in charge of the first self-funded student alumni association stated that the students in that session were statistically admitted to 33 universities in the United States, with the University of Michigan being the most, followed by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Harvard, Columbia, and New York Universities. The actual number of people who went abroad was more than 290, and more than 210 had obtained master's degrees, and two had even obtained doctorates in engineering. Because the country needs talents to build the country, most of the students have returned home after finishing their studies. At present, in addition to more than 30 people who are in factories and large companies in the United States for internships, more than 50 people who are continuing to study for doctorates in the United States, and more than 10 people who are working in various units of the United Nations government, the remaining approximately 200 students have returned to China and are serving in various agencies, factories, and universities in their own country, occupying important positions and achieving remarkable results. The alumni association of the self-funded students of that session has now moved from the United States to Shanghai, and has set up a temporary office at Room 410, York Building, 29 Tianzhutang Street, this city, to handle the registration and liaison affairs of the students. I hope that the students who have returned to China will contact Li Xiang at the association as soon as possible.

[Another Report] The second alumni association of self-funded students will hold a social gathering at the Shanghai Youth Hall, 454 Huashan Road, this city, at 6:00 pm tomorrow (the 30th).

### Reform Can Be Implemented When the Time is Right, Currency System Reform Is Not Difficult, Ample Preparation Should Be Made Now, Funding is Easily Solved

[Report from our newspaper] Since Special Envoy Wedemeyer came to China, discussions about currency system reform have resurfaced. Fan Heyan, Deputy Director of the Secretariat of the Central Bank, expressed his views on this issue from his personal standpoint. He stated that China's currency system reform is currently fully prepared, waiting for the right time to be implemented. Because after eight years of the War of Resistance and then facing the Communist rebellion, the issuance of currency has reduced the people's belief in legal tender. If reform is implemented, the value of the currency can be determined, prices will stabilize accordingly, and the balance of financial revenue and expenditure can gradually be achieved. Furthermore, the number of Chinese banknotes issued is not excessive, only equivalent to 3-4 billion US dollars, and the funding for currency system reform is easily solved. After the currency system reform, the true situation will be made public at any time, which can reduce the people's unnecessary doubts. China is an agricultural country, and its people are hardworking and simple in their needs. Various materials are not as scarce as generally rumored, so China's economic situation today is not very serious. Recently, the military situation has improved, and the situation is very stable. Currency system reform does not seem to need to wait until the end of the suppression of the Communists.

### More Buying than Selling of Chinese Stocks, Unstable Fluctuations

Among Chinese stocks yesterday, only Yongsha was relatively stable amidst the volatility. Xinyi and Meiya became even more sluggish, difficult to recover, and the process was very bleak. The payment of capital made people feel that the availability of funds would be tight, and the trend was not optimistic. Furthermore, spot Yongsha began to loosen, and ordinary stockholders took advantage of the high prices to sell their shares. Guangkan helped both inside and outside the field also sell, so the overall situation was not as tight as in the previous days. Active participants in the industry dumped empty shares, and the banking gang went in and out initially, but the recent close was relatively peaceful.

The morning opening was relatively stable. After the opening of the Yongsha, it advanced from 112, No. 94 to 240 yuan. Numbers 104, 173, 231, and 219 were sold off, retreating to 231 yuan.

Numbers 8 and 14 supplied at high prices but were blocked. Number 232 also sold after entering. Numbers 212, 231, 163, 224, 152, 160, and 180 sold off one after another. Guangkan helped close positions outside the field. People's sentiment was slightly fatigued due to financial concerns. Numbers 171, 45, 160, 152, and 183 even supplied spot Yongsha. Close to noon, the Yongsha was forced down to 228 yuan. After 12:00 PM, short positions were covered. Numbers 235 and 61 bought in, and numbers 56 and 190 also bought spot Yongsha. Number 218 still supplied for sale. Number 171 and 106 still sold spot Yongsha. The market price saw a major tug-of-war around 230 yuan.

At the close, Number 8 entered with Yongsha. Numbers 190 and 156 entered with spot Yongsha. The closing price was very stable. Among other familiar stocks, only Xinguang and Jingfu were able to pull up after falling. The chronic illnesses of Xinyi and Meiya were difficult to cure. As a result, compared to the previous close, the spot Yongsha rose slightly, Xinguang and Jingfu declined slightly, Meiya and Xinyi fell by half a percent, Zhongfa, Yonggong, and Dongxing each fell by about one percent, Xinhua fell by half a percent, and Jinglun also fell.

The trading volume was around 2 million.

Among foreign stocks yesterday, only the paper industry caused a lot of profit-taking news due to the shareholders' meeting. There was news of exchanging China Paper Edition Company stock, starting from 24,000 yuan. Foreign merchants pushed the buying price up to 27,500 yuan to close. Because the stimulating performance of the remaining stocks was reduced, they were all tired. Yisha opened in the morning at 85,000 yuan, retreated from 87,000 yuan to 79,000 yuan, and then hovered outside 80,000 yuan. The securities gang and Jinhao industry sold, and the Guangkan and foreign companies bought.

### Four Banks Savings Association Prepares to Repay Pre-War Deposits

Regarding the issue of repaying pre-war deposits, there has been no appropriate solution to date. Previous court rulings to repay at a rate of 1,000 to 2,000 times have been strongly opposed by the banking industry. The Legislative Yuan is now planning to repay at two rates of more than 900 times and more than 300 times, and stipulates that national banks and civil affairs are not included in this example. This point has also aroused opposition from all walks of life. It is generally believed that if pre-war deposits of national banks are still repaid on a 1:1 basis, it would be tantamount to losing the public's trust in national banking institutions. How can savings deposits be absorbed through normal means in the future? Therefore, it is hoped that the Legislative Yuan will seriously consider this issue when completing the legislative procedures.

It is also reported that the Four Banks Savings Association has the largest number of pre-war deposits among the commercial banks. It is said that after the number of times to be repaid is determined, the Association will sell real estate to repay the number of times it should repay.

### Various Difficulties Awaiting Overcoming, Shanghai's Coal Supply Still Falls Short, Resignation of Chairman of Fuel Management Committee, Xu Letian, Approved

Recently, the situation of coal arriving from various places has improved, which is largely due to the assistance of President Zhang of the Central Bank.

[Also Reported] Xu Letian, Chairman of the Fuel Management Committee, and Zhang Xiwei, Deputy Chairman, are scheduled to go to Beijing together on the 30th to participate in the National Coal Production Increase Conference convened by the Ministry of Economic Affairs on August 1st. The Fuel Management Committee has prepared a written report on the current coal production situation in various places, with attached suggestions for improvement, to be submitted to the conference for discussion.

Chairman Xu of the Committee repeatedly requested to resign due to gastric ulcer, and has recently received approval from the Ministry of Economic Affairs. The directive stated that the member has been in charge of the Committee's affairs for many years and is deeply trusted. After repeatedly expressing his illness and firmly requesting his resignation, and recommending Deputy Director Zhang Xiwei to take over the position, the request was approved. However, he should hand over the duties of the Director of the Committee at the end of this month and has been hired by the Ministry as a consultant. After handing over the Committee's affairs, it is still hoped that he will overcome difficulties together and continue to guide the Committee's affairs. In addition to issuing separate appointment and dismissal orders, a letter of appointment and dismissal has been issued, which should be received and forwarded. After receiving the order, Chairman Xu immediately thanked Minister Liang and ordered his subordinates to expedite the transfer.

### Cotton Yarn and Cloth Stable

Cotton yarn fluctuated little yesterday. The initial opening was stable due to the participation of customer organizations, but then there were many sales due to tight funds, so the prices varied. 42s remained stable and unchanged. 20s Light Weight Double Horse was 10.9 million yuan, rising to 11.1 million yuan at the close, a rise of 200,000 yuan. The rest rose or fell by 100,000 to 300,000 yuan.

The opening price of Longtou fine cloth yesterday was low, but the market rebounded once after some scattered purchases. The closing price at noon was similar. Due to the end of the month, funds were tight, and there were many sales, so various goods were slightly sold off. Longtou fine cloth was stable at 434,000 yuan. The rest of the white blanks were also mostly small. Shilin cloth showed no change.

Textile Building Allotted Yarn

[Report from our newspaper] China Textile Building Company, as usual, jointly allotted yarn on behalf of the Textile Adjustment Association yesterday, allotting a total of 1,223 pieces, all of which were allotted to manufacturers. A total of 450 purchase applications were received.

### Spot Cotton Trading Inactive

Yesterday, the spot cotton market was stable, and prices were neither rising nor falling. Cotton yarn prices were slightly better, and people's sentiment was stable. However, yarn factories had absorbed a lot in the middle and upper parts of the past, so their intention to enter was slightly relaxed, so the transaction volume was not high. The price of each grade for delivery to the factory was 1.73 million for Huoji, 1.8 million for Nantai, and the price for delivery to the warehouse was 2.2 million for Lingbao, 1.68 million for Huoji, and 325,000 for Zihua.

### Please Postpone the Opening of Trade with Japan

The Proposal of the China National Products Manufacturers Association

The China National Products Manufacturers Association held a meeting of directors and supervisors yesterday at the Jingu Hotel, attended by Wang Xiaolai, Gu Kemin, Ge Futian, Cao Zhigong, Tao Leqin, etc. Regarding the issue of opening trade with Japan, it was decided to telegraph the central government to postpone the opening of trade with Japan.

### Tea Market Trading Not Dull, Domestic Sales Show Frequent Bright Spots

Yesterday, in the foreign tea market, only Wuchang Tea Company continued to inquire about low-grade Chen Qimen tea, while other exporters were mostly congested in their stomachs. It is estimated that the reason is that they are all busy replicating the 900 tons of Zhenmei green tea that French merchant Yongxing Foreign Company recently negotiated with Morocco in Africa, so as to actively deliver the goods and load them quickly, so the market is not lively. However, those who hold the goods hold a steady mentality, so the situation is still stable. As for the various domestic varieties, at this time of intense heat and sweating like rain, the de-icing by the street and customer organizations continued to increase day by day, so the transaction was still like a fish in water, and the prices showed frequent bright spots.

### 60,000 Boxes of Tea Under Mortgage; Farmers Bank Processing Collateral

Last year's aged tea, the Central Trust Bureau has already closed applications on the 25th of this month. The Farmers Bank of China is processing the collateral of mortgaged tea boxes that have not been redeemed by the due date, in accordance with regulations.

It is reported that as of the 28th, the Farmers Bank still holds mortgaged tea boxes: (1) Ping tea, 13,500 boxes, outstanding loan of 9 billion; (2) Qihong tea, 15,200 boxes, outstanding loan of 4.2 billion; (3) Tunlv tea, 2,100 boxes, outstanding loan of 450 million. In addition, there are also 300 boxes of Wenhong tea, with an outstanding loan of 250 million, and 500 boxes of Yulv tea, with an outstanding loan of 80 million. In total, there are 61,600 boxes, with an outstanding loan of 13.9 billion. Eight percent of these loans are not yet due, while the rest are overdue. The Farmers Bank is individually processing the collateral and still handing it over to the Central Trust Bureau for purchase.

### Revised Plan for Regulating Yarn and Cloth by the Ministry of Economic Affairs

[Report from this newspaper] The "Implementation Plan for Regulating Yarn and Cloth to Develop the Textile Industry," previously passed by the Silk and Cloth Association and submitted to the Ministry of Economic Affairs, has now been revised and returned by the Ministry. It is reported that there are many revisions, including: (1) increasing the supply of raw cotton, (2) improving technology to enhance quality, (3) controlling yarn and cloth, and (4) exporting yarn and cloth, etc. The leaders of the six regional cotton textile associations exchanged views on the revisions made by the Ministry of Economic Affairs yesterday, but no conclusions were reached.

### Sericulture and Silk Guidance Committee; Design Committee to be Established Today

[Report from this newspaper] The Sericulture and Silk Production and Marketing Guidance Committee, in order to actively promote the export of raw silk, has been preparing to establish a Design Committee. After more than a month of preparation, various organizational charters, work plans, etc., have been drafted. It is learned that the Committee is scheduled to be formally established today at 4:00 PM and will hold its first meeting at the Central Bank at the same time. Committee Chairman Liu Gongyun, Standing Committee members Ge Jingzhong, Mark, and Tan Xihong will all be present.

### Food Rice Digestion Active; Market Price Continues to Rise Firmly

Yesterday, the total arrival of rice grains in the North and South markets was more than 3,300 dan (Áü≥). Digestion in the South market was still active, with Japonica and Indica rice prices rising by more than 10,000 yuan. The North market was lackluster in demand, with Japonica glutinous rice and high-grade materials slightly rising by 3,000 to 5,000 yuan. Medium and lower grades remained stable, and white rice was comparable.

Flour is about to be transshipped by Shenfang, market sentiment is firming, and prices continued to rise by 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Wheat bran remained stable. Bean cake factories were quite firm in their holdings, and prices rose again by 3,000 to 4,000 yuan. Yingkou cake increased sharply by 6,000 to 7,000 yuan. Soybean oil factories were absorbing supplies, and oil dealers, due to the high price of bean cake, were also actively procuring soybeans. Consequently, this street also followed suit in purchasing, and both new and old soybeans soared by more than 10,000 yuan. Broad beans were comparable, red beans remained unchanged for the time being, corn was stable, and red sorghum, being scarce, remained strong, rising by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan.

Raw peanuts purchased from Southeast Asia suddenly became active, rising sharply by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan. Sesame remained firm, field peas were stable, and broad beans were in a state of decline. Wheat, due to the rise in flour prices, rose accordingly, rebounding by 10,000 yuan. However, the price of wheat offered by factories yesterday was a uniform standard price of 145,000 yuan, with adjustments for mud, ash, and moisture content as usual. Oil market showed slight discrepancies, soybean oil remained flat, clear oil declined by 10,000 yuan, rapeseed oil also decreased by more than 10,000 yuan, sesame oil rose by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan, basket peanut oil was comparable, and Jiton (ÂêâÊ°∂) peanut oil fell by 10,000 to 20,000 yuan.

### Large Quantities of Rice from Rangoon Arrive in Shanghai

[Report from this newspaper] The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Hai Xuan ship, which transported a large quantity of rice from Rangoon to Shanghai, arrived at the port the day before yesterday (Sunday) evening and berthed at buoys number six and seven. It carried 122,678 bags of rice, totaling 8,919 tons, all purchased by the Central Trust Bureau. In addition, the foreign manager of Jardine Matheson and Co.'s, the "Qiao Qian Tuo Man Si" ship, arrived in Shanghai last Saturday, carrying 300 tons of foreign paper, 600 tons of pulp, and more than 1,000 large Kimura (Êú®Êùë) logs from Vancouver.

### Taiwan Sugar Continues Distribution as Usual; Rising Sugar Market Dampened

The sugar market, which was affected by loose credit and rising prices of a hundred commodities over the weekend, saw a resurgence of rising tides. The current spot price for both single and double grades (medium and white refined sugar) had to be increased by more than 20,000 yuan. Although it was Sunday the day before yesterday, the market was still active and trading volume nearly doubled. The market opened higher yesterday morning, but then it was heard that the Taiwan Sugar Corporation had temporarily combined the second phase of distribution due to insufficient shipments. Now that it has resumed its original state, it will continue to distribute every week from this phase onwards. As a result, bulls rushed to sell, and the market situation turned from a peak to a downward trend, but it was still more than 10,000 yuan higher than last week.

### High Raw Material Costs Increase; Match Production Declines

The match industry in this city is the center of the national match industry. The output of all match factories is sold to the provinces of Central China, accounting for about three-fifths, while the rest is sold to various places in North China. This city and the surrounding suburbs account for only a small part. During the months of April, May, and June of this year, all match factories once increased production and shipped their products to various parts of the country.

Now, people in the industry say: Since July, the production volume of each factory has begun to decline. The biggest reason is the reduction in sales in other ports. Provinces and regions affected by the war, such as the Northeast, cannot be directly transported to, and even other places, due to the decline of industry and commerce, the purchasing power of the people is becoming weaker. Especially since the increase in sea and land freight rates has increased the cost of sales to other ports, further increasing the burden on users in other ports. In this economic situation, the reduction in sales is inevitable.

As for the manufacturing of finished products, raw materials are increasingly scarce, resulting in high prices. Moreover, the cost is even more difficult to estimate, as workers' wages must be calculated based on the cost of living index. If the price of finished products follows the proportion of raw materials and labor and rises, the maintenance of sales will be even more worrying. Therefore, most match factories, even if they have sufficient raw materials, would rather store them and reduce production appropriately in order to suffer less losses and expect an improvement in the market.

### Yizhong Cigarettes Turn from Weak to Rise; Soap and Matches Flourish

The trend of cigarettes, soap, and matches shows both firm and weak trends. At the opening yesterday, each grade was still considered stable, but later, due to weakening customer demand, the market gradually rose.

Cigarettes: Yizhong goods have been distributing goods continuously for several days, with supply exceeding demand, and customers are waiting and watching, with consecutive days of declines. Finally, the decline was too volatile, and the market rebounded and improved yesterday. However, Chinese-made cigarettes mostly fell from high to flat, with very few firm rises.

Matches were seemingly loose but actually tight. Both "Beautiful" and "Phoenix" brands saw price increases, while only "Golden Tripod" saw a slight decline, and the remaining goods remained stable. Soap was firm and thriving, full of vitality. "Gu Ben" rose by 8,000 yuan, "Arrow Knife" rose by 9,000 yuan, and the rest uniformly rose.

### China Silk Corporation Specifies Methods for Cocoon Reeling Above Quota

The main points of the China Silk Corporation's method for sericulture farmers cocoon replacements over the quota are as follows: (1) Silk reeling manufacturers who did not receive loans for spring cocoons this period, and who have no other dry cocoons for reeling. (2) Association member manufacturers. (3) Manufacturers that started operations in 1946, having 40 or more silk reeling machines. Manufacturers that did not start operations in 1946, having 60 or more. Winter reeling machines are calculated at 10 machines per 10 threads. (4) The total amount of excess cocoons is limited to 5,000 dan of dry cocoons. (5) The number of cocoons allocated is 7 catties (Â∏ÇÊñ§) of cocoons per day for each multi-thread silk reeling machine. For each sitting reeling machine, 4 to 5 catties of cocoons are allocated per day. The reeling period is until October 31st. (6) The guarantees of each manufacturer are based on equivalent acceptance bills as the first guarantee, and factory equipment as the second guarantee, with certification from the Third District Association. (7) For the allocation of cocoons for silk reeling, the amount of cocoons for reeling for 15 days will be issued first. Afterwards, cocoons will be allocated in batches every 10 days based on the amount of silk reeled. (8) Reeling discounts and replacement fees: The reeling discount for replaced cocoons will be based on the standard of the trial reeling. At the end of the replacement reeling, the manufacturer will settle the actual amount of silk handed over and must not be short. If there is a shortage of less than 2 dan, it will be compensated at the price of Shanghai D-grade raw silk. The replacement reeling fee for each dan of raw silk, in addition to offsetting dry and wet waste, will be handled according to the replacement reeling fee standard set by the Sericulture and Silk Guidance Committee.

### Sharp Decline in Penghu Fish Production

[Central News Agency, Penghu, 28th] According to statistics, the fishing catch in Penghu County in June was 64,413 kilograms, worth NT$1,858,030, a sharp decline in production compared to before. The Penghu Islands are scattered in the southern part of the Taiwan Strait, with a coastline extending more than 160 kilometers. They are also located at the intersection of warm and cold currents, resulting in an extremely abundant aquatic life. The main fish products are mackerel, tuna, shark, cuttlefish, seaweed, laver, etc. In the past, the annual output would be as high as 4 million kilograms, exported to Japan and Taiwan. Currently, most fishing boats have been destroyed, and they can only rely on building stone formations on the coast to catch fish, called "stone weirs." There are more than 300 stone weirs in the county. Due to the primitive fishing methods, production has been sharply reduced. People engaged in fishing account for 70% of the Penghu population. To develop Penghu, it is urgent to revitalize the fishing industry.

### Difficult Agreement on Chemical and Dye Industries; Disputes over Quota Allocation of Raw Materials; Representatives of the Review Committee to Visit Director Shen to Discuss

[Report from this newspaper] The Quota Allocation Department of the Import Management Committee had already allocated quotas for industrial raw materials to importers based on last year's import performance. Later, due to the limited supply of industrial raw materials and the increasing difference between official and black market exchange rates, the Industrial Association consulted with the Allocation Department to make preliminary allocations among various industrial associations, and then contacted importers to seek direct allocation of national foreign exchange to the manufacturing industry in a way that would be truly beneficial. Later, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Industrial Association jointly organized an Allocation Review Committee to collect reports from various industrial and commercial trade associations to handle negotiations. Raw materials such as tanning extracts, oils and fats, black iron sheets, iron, steel wire, angle iron, and pipes were negotiated and allocated by the relevant associations, such as the Soap Industry Association, the Cosmetics Industry Association, the Ironware Engineering Association, the Ironware Industry Association, the Hardware Business Association, the Electrical Equipment Industry Association, the Canned Food Industry Association, the Tin Printing and Can Manufacturing Industry Association, the Thermos Bottle Industry Association, and the Hardware Parts Business Association, and submitted to the Allocation Department. Other raw materials are also being handled in succession.

According to sources from the Review Committee: The most difficult and time-consuming to reach an agreement on are dyes and chemical raw materials. For both, several meetings have been convened with various industrial and commercial associations, with each meeting attended by more than 20 units. The various industrial associations, as early as in accordance with the notification of the Industrial Association, hoped to respect the agreement and were able to cooperate sincerely. The manufacturers members of the industrial associations were also able to listen to the instructions of their associations and wait quietly for allocation. However, the Chemical Raw Materials Business Association and the Pigment Business Association have consistently failed to reach an agreement.

Yesterday afternoon was the dye allocation meeting, with 24 industries in the industrial associations gathered at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, while the pigment industry was absent again, resulting in the failure of the agreement between industry and commerce. On the part of the Allocation Department, the pressure was very urgent and it indicated that it was impatient and was about to open up. The person in charge of the Review Committee expressed great anxiety. At the meeting yesterday, many people advocated that if the agreement is not reached and the allocation is unfair, the government should be requested to directly handle the import of raw materials, and then the Central Trust Bureau should sell them in batches to practical users through bidding.

According to sources from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce: Yesterday, two officials from the Allocation Department attended the meeting and expressed regret at the slow progress of the Review Committee's negotiations. They also said that 70% of the first quarter's quota has been signed out. However, it is said that when the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Industrial Association initially organized the Review Committee to handle negotiations, it was entrusted directly by Shen Zoting, the director of the Allocation Department, and was reported on file. Now that the Review Committee is in the process of negotiating, but the Allocation Department has already opened up 70%, this makes those who are loyal to the effort feel left out. Whether in the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Industrial Association, or the various industrial trade associations, it is difficult to explain to their members.

The Review Committee has already designated representatives to visit Director Shen this morning to discuss solutions. One part of the opinion is to request the Allocation Department to stipulate the ratio between industry and commerce in a decisive manner, while another part of the opinion is to advocate a strong appeal to the National Economic Commission to correct the current trade policy.

### Market Opened with a Dismal Drop Yesterday; Rayon Listless and Unable to Rise; Factory Dealings Scarce; Silk Prices Soft

Rayon was soft due to the pending distribution, therefore the market opened with a dismal drop yesterday. No. 120 Dongyang Yuguang opened at 24.7 million yuan for loose goods, and hovered between 24.4 million and 24.6 million yuan until noon. The smallest price in the afternoon was 24.2 million yuan, and the final closing price was 24.4 million yuan. The final selling price of Gaoshan Yuguang was 24.2 million yuan, a decrease of 2 million yuan compared to last Saturday.

Factory dealings were very scarce, and the market was sluggish. BC grade asking prices were around 30 million yuan, but there were some transactions, priced at 28 million and 28.5 million yuan, but the payment was due in one week. In the afternoon, 15 dan of E-grade were traded, with a price fluctuation of 10,000 yuan. 10 dan were sold for 28.5 million yuan, and 5 dan were sold for 28.4 million yuan. Half of the payment was made in cash, and half was in promissory notes due in seven days. Asking prices for Qianjing zero dan were 17.5 million yuan, while the price of lower grade rayon was between 16.5 million and 17 million yuan.

Silk goods were also weak. Although real silk quilt covers were actively traded, prices did not rise. Huaqiang quilt covers were traded at the opening price of 10.72 million and 10.71 million yuan, then immediately traded at 10.7 million yuan spot, and 10.74 million yuan for delivery the next day. There was a slight increase after being pulled up in the middle, with next-day delivery at 10.78 million yuan, then dropped again. The spot price hovered around 10.7 million yuan, with no significant change at the close. The final price of Dazheng quilt covers was 10.75 million yuan, with next-day delivery asking price of 10.8 million yuan. Meiya quilt covers were not traded at 11.5 million yuan. Dazheng checkered crepe was listless and unable to rise. Market sentiment was wavering, and trading was quiet. The opening asking price was 6,000 yuan for selling, but no one asked. It then dropped to 5,500 yuan, and an offer of 5,000 yuan was not traded. As a result, someone wanted it for 35,200 yuan. Huajin crepe was 22,000 yuan in the morning, but in the afternoon, due to the drop in rayon prices, no one asked about it. Other goods were traded very sparsely and prices were also soft.

### Four Powers Allocate Small Japanese Warships; Disintegration of the Japanese Navy

‚Äî Special Correspondent of this newspaper, Fu Junyi

Tokyo, 24th

Before the war, Japan was one of the two major naval powers, focusing on the navy from the beginning of its military build-up. In March of the third year of Meiji (1870), the Ministry of Military Affairs stated in the "Opinion on Establishing the Navy": "The strength of national power does not lie in the size of the military force, and the size of the military force is related to the amount of military expenditure. If we want to rise to prominence in the world in the future, we still need to discuss a strategy of focusing national power to expand the navy." At the beginning of the Japanese navy's ship building, most warships were purchased from Europe, and technicians were also hired from abroad. In 1872, the strength of the Japanese navy was only 14 ships, totaling 12,352 tons. The largest warship, the "Tsukuba" (Ë•≤), was only 2,530 tons. After 1870, due to disputes with the Qing Dynasty over the issue of the Ryukyu Islands and Taiwan, Japan's shipbuilding target was to counter the Qing Dynasty fleet. The Qing Dynasty's two major battleships, the "Dingyuan" and "Zhenyuan," were both 7,335-ton ironclad ships, while Japan's largest cruisers, the "Itsukushima," "Matsushima," and "Hashidate," were only 4,300 tons.

After the Sino-Japanese War in the late Qing Dynasty, Japan's shipbuilding target was to counter the Russian Far East Fleet. At that time, most warships were purchased from Britain. Later, the power of the U.S. Navy rose, and after the naval arms limitation conference, Japan's shipbuilding target changed. Its hypothetical enemy turned to the United States, and it expected a day when Japan and the United States would engage in close combat on the Pacific Ocean. It deliberately planned to strike first and win in a short-term operation, and finally launched an unprovoked war, playing the ugly drama of the Pearl Harbor attack. The Japanese called it a strategy of "attacking with initiative." The characteristic of Japan's shipbuilding in the later period was to focus on this point. That is, it adopted the doctrine of big guns and giant ships, overemphasizing offensive capabilities while reducing the space occupied by crew members and defensive capabilities. Once encountering a powerful aircraft carrier air force attack, it was at a loss and struggled to cope, and the entire army was wiped out. After the Pearl Harbor attack, the Japanese navy suffered a crushing defeat in the four major naval battles: the Coral Sea Battle, the Battle of Midway, the Battle of Saipan, and the Battle of the Philippine Sea. The treasures of the Japanese fleet, the two battleships "Yamato" and "Musashi" that boasted to the world, could not save the defeat of the Japanese navy. The "Yamato" sank in the Battle of Okinawa, and the "Musashi" sank in the Battle of the Philippine Sea, finally unable to withstand the final blow of the American aircraft carrier aircraft. The Japanese navy was almost completely lost in this war. The detailed figures are as follows:

Table of Japanese Ship Losses During the War

Each of the First Batch of Japanese Ships Gets Eight Ships

The Potsdam Declaration stipulated that the Japanese army and navy should be completely disarmed. After Japan surrendered, the Navy dissolved itself. Regarding the disposal of the remaining warships, U.S. Ambassador to the Allied Council for Japan Acheson said at the Allied Council for Japan on September 18, 1946: Large warships larger than submarines will either be dismantled and destroyed or sunk. However, some of them will be used for repatriation. After the repatriation is completed, they will be dismantled and destroyed. The weapons used by the warships will also be destroyed. According to the announcement by MacArthur Headquarters on September 28th of last year: In addition to the destroyers used for repatriation, other large warships will be dismantled and destroyed in accordance with the Commander-in-Chief's order. The amount of waste obtained will reach 158,180 tons. This work is expected to be completed this year. Currently, 21,010 tons have been destroyed, accounting for 13.3% of the total tonnage. The total displacement of the destroyed warships is 395,171 tons. It is said that in addition to the 131 ships used for repatriation, there are still some ships driven by the Japanese for patrol purposes. According to the regulations of the MacArthur Headquarters, after the Japanese army is disarmed, all weapons should be handed over to the U.S. military for safekeeping and destruction, but a part can be submitted as souvenirs and war trophies. The U.S. Navy Far East Command specially proposed 96 remaining Japanese ships (including 24 destroyers, 68 escort ships, and 4 transport ships) to be divided among the four countries of China, the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union by lottery. It was held in three batches. The first batch was held on the 24th of last month at the first mutual building of MacArthur Headquarters. The ceremony was quite grand. Participants included our country's representative, Navy Colonel Ma Deting, U.S. representative Colonel Byrd (Chief of Staff of the Far East Naval Command), British representative Colonel Settidge, and Soviet representative Major General Stiyego. The first batch of ships allocated was 32 ships, including 12 destroyers and 20 escort ships, with eight ships for each country. What our country drew was the best of them. The list is as follows:

Table of Japanese Ships Allocated to Our Country for the First Time

The first batch of ships allocated to our country sailed from Sasebo to Shanghai on July 1st. The second lottery was also held on the morning of the 17th at the U.S. Navy Far East Command. The attending representatives were the same as the first time, with each country receiving eight ships. Britain received 8,910 tons, the United States received 8,660 tons, the Soviet Union received 8,450 tons, and our country received 8,450 tons. The quality was far inferior to the previous time, mostly produced in 1945. The types are as follows:

Ship Name Ship Type Year of Construction Tonnage

Tsuta Destroyer 1943-1945 1580

Sugi Same as above Same as above 1530

No. 118 First-Class Escort Ship 1944-1945 900

No. 198 Same as above Same as above Same as above

No. 192 Same as above Same as above Same as above

No. 205 Second-Class Escort Ship Same as above 810

No. 85 Same as above Same as above Same as above

Tsushima Escort Ship 1939 1020

The second batch of Japanese ships drawn will open to Shanghai on the 26th of this month. The third lottery has 32 ships and will be held in August. The ships drawn have no weapons and equipment. The four countries of China, the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union are still discussing how to allocate the fourth batch of 48 ships.

Differing Opinions on the Quality of Japanese Ships

Regarding the significance of this allocation of Japanese ships, Military Representative Colonel Ma Dejian said: "Although the warships obtained this time are limited, their significance is very great. Our country's sea defense has been invaded by Japanese bandits for decades. After our eight years of unyielding resistance, not only has national shame been avenged, but we have also been able to share naval spoils of war alongside the great powers, which is infinitely glorious." Navy Major Zhong Hanbo, who escorted the first batch of ships back to the country, told reporters: "The escort ships obtained this time will provide some help to our country's sea defense of the South China Sea and the East and West Sand Islands. Because the Japanese ships are light and compact in structure, and the tonnage is relatively small, the amount of oil used is less, and five tons of fuel oil can travel 240 nautical miles. Various maintenance and repair work are suitable for Chinese technical conditions." Ito Masanori, a naval commentator before the war and current president of Kyodo News, told reporters regarding the merits and demerits of Japanese ships: "Japanese shipbuilding is mostly focused on strengthening combat power, that is, strengthening firepower as much as possible, while ignoring human habitability, that is, the space occupied by crew members is far less important than the space occupied by weapons. It is suitable for attack, but inferior in defense. If the battle lasts too long, the soldiers will easily feel tired, so it is not suitable for the operating conditions of the South Pacific. Although the speed is high, the endurance is small."

The weapons of the Japanese Navy have been destroyed, but the spiritual transformation of the Japanese demobilized naval personnel still needs the self-awareness of the Japanese and the supervision of the Allies.

### Record of the New Governor's Inauguration in Hong Kong

‚Äî Special Correspondent Cheng Zhizheng from this newspaper

Hong Kong, 25th (Airmail dispatch)

Since the departure of the former Governor of Hong Kong, Sir Mark Aitchison Young, on May 16th, the people of Hong Kong have been eagerly anticipating the arrival of the new Governor. Finally, today (July 25th), the new Governor, Sir Alexander William George Herder Grantham, arrived in Hong Kong, albeit belatedly! The atmosphere of peace and prosperity in Hong Kong was further enlivened, and despite the unfavorable weather, with rain falling all day, colorful flags fluttered, music filled the air, and the enthusiasm of all the residents remained high.

Heavy Rain, New Governor Flies In

Governor Grantham and his wife took a British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) special plane from Singapore this morning to Hong Kong. They were scheduled to arrive at Kai Tak Airport at 3:00 PM. However, due to the heavy rain that persisted throughout the afternoon, many people were concerned about the safety of the new Governor's flight and thought that he would not be able to arrive in Hong Kong today! Unexpectedly, just after 3:00 PM, the BOAC plane appeared in the clouds over Hong Kong. Soon, the pilot used his skillful expertise to land safely. The Governor disembarked first and shook hands with the acting Governor, McDougall, and the commanders of the naval, land, and air forces stationed in Hong Kong. The Governor was tall, bald, with piercing eyes, and appeared vigorous, showing no signs of fatigue from the journey. The Governor's wife was petite, standing almost a head shorter than the Governor. They rested in the airport lounge for a while, changed into the Governor's official uniform, and then boarded the "Golden Crown" special ship to cross the sea, arriving at Queen's Pier at 4:45 PM. A group of important officials, dignitaries, and foreign envoys were already lined up at the pier. After the Governor disembarked, he shook hands with the welcoming crowd, many of whom were old friends of the Governor, making the atmosphere particularly warm. Standing in the square outside the pier were detachments from the naval, land, and air forces. As the Governor stepped out of the pier, the band played the British national anthem, and the three armed forces saluted. The Governor returned the salute. Due to the heavy rain, there was no review of the troops. The Governor then proceeded by car to the Government House to rest.

Moving Speech Earns Applause

At 6:00 PM, a grand welcoming reception was held at the Entertainment Theatre. In addition to the Governor and his wife, the dignitaries seated on the stage included Admiral Power, Commander-in-Chief of the British Pacific Fleet, and over thirty others. Two bishops, dressed in red robes and wearing wigs, attracted the attention of many spectators. The lower level was occupied by ordinary guests and the press, while the upper level was filled with citizens. The theatre was packed to an unprecedented degree. The Governor, wearing formal attire, sat in the center, with a very serious demeanor. After the national anthem was played, Morse, the General Manager of the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, delivered a welcoming speech on behalf of the citizens. Morse read a prepared speech fluently, which mainly consisted of praising the Governor with many customary remarks. Zhou Jiao Nian then recited the translation, while Tan Wen used regular script to write it on beautifully decorated pages, presumably as a souvenir for the Governor.

After a while, the Governor rose to give his reply. He did not have a prepared speech, but his remarks were not only well-organized and meaningful, but also melodious and moving. He said: Hong Kong is his second home. He had served in Hong Kong for twelve years in the past, and he was delighted to be back and see many old friends. He then spoke about the political and economic difficulties faced by many countries he had recently observed, with the United States being no exception. He acknowledged that Hong Kong had much to rebuild and was facing financial constraints, but he hoped to cooperate with the citizens and with friendly and great China to achieve the goal of Hong Kong's revival.

After his speech, the applause lasted for almost five minutes, which fully demonstrated how moving and sincere his speech was. After Zhou Jiao Nian translated it into Chinese, the Governor and his wife left first. They then rushed to the Legislative Council to be sworn in. The new Governor was quite busy that afternoon. When the British battleship HMS Belfast fired a 17-gun salute, the people of Hong Kong generally knew that the new Governor had officially taken office.

Revisiting Old Haunts with a Fresh Perspective

Sir Alexander Grantham graduated from Cambridge University and later received military training at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst. During the First World War, he fought in France and Belgium, achieving remarkable military exploits. He came to Hong Kong in 1922, initially serving as a magistrate in the Central Magistracy, and later promoted to Assistant Colonial Secretary. He left Hong Kong in 1934 to attend the Imperial Defence College in the United Kingdom. In 1935, he was appointed Colonial Secretary of Bermuda. Three years later, he was transferred to Jamaica as Colonial Secretary. In 1941, he became Colonial Secretary of Nigeria. In 1945, he was knighted. In the same year, he was appointed Governor and Commander-in-Chief of Fiji and High Commissioner for the Western Pacific. He was appointed to his current position this spring. He is forty-eight years old. His wife is from California, USA. They have been married for over a decade and have no children.

### Jiangxi's Rural Areas and Mining Industry

‚Äî Our Correspondent Liu Zao

Nanchang, 20th (Airmail dispatch)

Jiangxi, known as the "Granary of Jiangyou," is experiencing economic decline in its rural areas. The poverty of more than 80% of its people is indescribably miserable. Last summer, people in "Dianshan" had no pork to eat. This year, Jiangxi people still do not have enough surplus grain to feed pigs.

The fertile land of Gan and the hardworking people of Jiangxi possess excellent conditions. Why is their life so desolate and miserable, turning the blessed land of the "Granary of Jiangyou" into a region of starvation and exile?

Banditry and war directly harm the rural areas, and their clutches have not yet been lifted. Currently, Jiangxi still bears the burden of huge amounts of military grain shipments and is also subject to various forms of extortion and high-interest exploitation. The people's hard work throughout the year, after the new grain is harvested, is barely enough to pay the state taxes and high-interest debts. The seeds left in their granaries for the next year are insufficient. Therefore, wild grass and grain husks are considered "blessings" for the poor.

The main reasons for the poverty in rural areas are: widespread wasteland, lack of manpower and livestock, insufficient fertilizer and medicine, and the harm caused by diseases and natural disasters. How to increase production in rural areas is the only way to solve the problem of the poor's livelihood.

Jiangxi's industry was lagging behind provinces like Hunan and Guangdong before the war. During the war, some foundations were established in southwestern Jiangxi. However, these industrial seedlings unexpectedly encountered the enemy's intrusion from south to north near the end of the war. Now they are under the pressure of high prices and wages, causing slow sales. The prospects for recovery are even more bleak.

During the war, Jiangxi's heavy industry included machinery, iron smelting, vehicle and shipbuilding, electrical engineering, sulfuric acid, and cement plants, jointly operated by the National Resources Commission (NRC) and the Jiangxi Provincial Government. Nine-tenths of these factories' facilities, buildings, and machinery were destroyed by the enemy, with losses amounting to at least 400 million yuan. As for light industry, the Provincial Industrial Development Corporation operated eleven factories, including alcohol, sugar, weaving and dyeing, hemp weaving, leather making, sawmills, porcelain, and printing. These were also damaged due to the enemy's repeated intrusions. Dozens of private factories producing matches, canned goods, textiles, and printing were all destroyed and closed down. Even Jingdezhen's porcelain industry, known throughout the world, originally had over 150 kilns, most of which were damaged during the war by enemy bombing. Now, less than one-third of them are operating again.

The tungsten mines in southern Jiangxi are a treasure among Jiangxi's mineral resources. According to official investigations, the total reserves in seventeen counties, including Dayu and Longnan, reach 4 million tons, ranking first in the world. Before the war, the annual output was 1,500 tons. In 1944, when the enemy intruded into southern Jiangxi from northern Guangdong, seizing the tungsten mines was one of their strategic objectives. As for the tungsten sand and ore beds, they were naturally thoroughly destroyed by the enemy, making it currently impossible to resume operations.

Secondly, there are the manganese mines and coal mines in Leping, as well as the coal regions in Pingxiang and Yugan counties. The total reserves are estimated at about 700 million tons, with an annual output of over 8 million tons. Before the war, the coal needed for the Nanxun Railway, the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, various power plants in the province, and the Gan River transport ships was supplied by Jiangxi coal. Several large coal mines, such as Anyuan and Tianhe, were shut down due to wartime destruction, or because of transportation difficulties, making it impossible to transport and sell the coal. They are now awaiting large-scale financial assistance to resume operations.

According to general estimates, the total iron ore reserves in Jiangxi are about 20 million tons, with the best quality found in Wushi Mountain in Yongxin. Starting in 1942, 20 tons of pig iron could be produced daily. In 1944, it also suffered significant losses due to the enemy's destruction.

Judging from the mineral reserves in Jiangxi, they are not only sufficient to establish large-scale light industry, but also to earn huge amounts of foreign exchange. If it can be quickly restored to production and operation, the country's wealth and the province's finances will not only increase but can also solve the unemployment of some of the industrial and mining technicians.

During the journey of recovery, rural areas and the mining industry should receive appropriate relief and assistance. In the agricultural sector, Jiangxi has also implemented emergency relief, promoting the lending of plows, waterwheels, distributing seeds, fertilizers, and agricultural tools, building farmhouses, and constructing farmland water conservancy projects, carrying out cattle epidemic prevention, and pest control. These efforts directly or indirectly benefit the rural areas, especially the water conservancy projects. With the ¬•100 million in relief funds for restoring dikes, the breaches and dangerous sections in Nanchang, Xinjian, and Yongxiu counties were completed, with earthwork totaling 6,120,377 cubic meters, 170 culverts, and a dike length of 780,530 meters, benefiting 880,654 mu of farmland. The dike restoration projects in sixteen counties, including Nanchang and Hukou, completed 38,832,220.13 cubic meters of earthwork and 13,634.50 cubic meters of stonework, benefiting 3,751,118 mu of farmland. In June of this year, the water levels of various rivers in Jiangxi rose sharply due to mountain floods, exceeding the historically high water levels, but the dikes in various places remained safe, and farmers were able to harvest a crop. This is a significant achievement in agricultural relief.

Amidst the calls for industrial recovery, Jiangxi's industrial and mining industries have suffered severe damage, and the strength of the relief efforts is pitifully weak, like a skilled woman unable to cook without rice! Although equipment allocated to China can be obtained cheaply and with preferential terms, Jiangxi's industrial sector lacks the resources to compete for these affordable factory equipment. Jiangxi natives residing in Beijing and Shanghai, such as Gui Yongqing, Liu Shiyi, and Liu Zhi, have repeatedly responded to the Jiangxi Relief Branch's initiative to seek industrial machinery. Although the preparatory committee for the Jiangxi Branch of the China Agricultural Machinery Company has been established, raising the ¬•6 billion in capital is still proving difficult.

The current difficulty facing Jiangxi's rural and industrial and mining industries is the lack of its own economic strength, making it difficult to embark on a path of rapid recovery. However, according to the report given by the Jiangxi Branch at a press conference regarding the relief supplies allocated to Jiangxi by the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), only over 27,000 tons were received from January to April of last year, less than one-fourth of Hunan's allocation.

Now, millions of agricultural and industrial workers are appealing to society, calling for more relief supplies to Jiangxi, especially for the industrial and mining industries, which are in even greater need of external assistance.

### The Life of Coking Expert Yu Zailin

‚Äî Zhou Jian

Beiping, 20th (Airmail dispatch)

Mining and metallurgical expert Yu Zailin dedicated his life to the study of mining and was renowned both at home and abroad. This time, he stubbornly defended the Beipiao Coal Mine but unfortunately, the mine was captured by the Communist forces on July 2nd, and Mr. Yu died as a martyr. The loss of such a national talent is deeply mourned. This newspaper has reported the details. Gao Ping, the Director of the Beiping branch of the Central Geological Survey of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, was a close friend of Mr. Yu, having been classmates for four years and known each other for twenty-five years. He has written an article detailing Mr. Yu's life and deeds, which is quite comprehensive. We have recorded the main points as follows:

On July 4th, it was reported that the "news from Beipiao is unclear." I immediately telegraphed Lei Baohua, the General Manager of the Beipiao Coal Mining Company in Jinzhou, inquiring about the whereabouts of Yu Zailin, the person in charge of the Beipiao project. No reply was received. Suddenly, I received a telegram from Guo Xiangyu, the new General Manager of the Beipiao Coal Mine, bearing tragic news: "Beipiao was captured by the Communist forces on the 2nd, and Brother Zailin died a martyr." After reading it, I felt lost, still hoping that his words were untrue. On the 14th, I received news from Beipiao that the Communist forces had automatically retreated on the night of the 8th, and the National Army had safely stationed in the mining area on the 9th. Mr. Yu's martyrdom has also been confirmed, so Mr. Yu is dead! Alas! A few days ago, I received news from a friend in Jinzhou that Mr. Yu's body had been eaten by wild dogs, and only twelve white bones were found, which were wrapped in cotton and coffined in the Jinzhou Martyrs' Shrine on the 14th. Such a tragic death is infinitely mournful. I was a classmate with Mr. Yu for four years and a good friend for twenty-five years, so I know him very well. Therefore, I will describe Mr. Yu's life, to be forever remembered.

Mr. Yu Zailin, also known as Zuiling, was a native of Sheng County, Zhejiang Province, born four years before the founding of the Republic of China. He was straightforward, chivalrous, and very refined in appearance. He studied diligently as a child and was always the top of his class. In 1922, he entered Anding Middle School in the provincial capital. His classmates respected his sincerity and responsibility, so he was elected as their representative. At that time, student movements were surging. Mr. Yu believed that young people like them should focus on their studies and tried to avoid getting involved. His classmates followed him, and the teachers loved him. I was very good friends with Mr. Yu, but we usually only discussed academic matters and did not talk about other things. He was a respected friend. After graduation, we went north together. Mr. Yu was admitted to Peiyang University. Two years later, he entered the Department of Mining and Metallurgy. After graduating in 1932, he worked at the Kailuan Mining Administration for two years. Due to his strong interest in research, he joined the Construction Committee and engaged in mining and metallurgical design work. Later, the Mining Office of the National Defense Design Committee (later known as the Mining and Metallurgical Research Institute of the Ministry of Economic Affairs) was established. Mr. Yu joined and specialized in the study of coal beneficiation and coking in various provinces. He wrote extensively. At that time, Mr. Yu had established a solid foundation in his career. He married Ms. Qian Aiqin, also from Sheng County. Ms. Qian graduated from Hangzhou Provincial High School. She was diligent and sincere. The couple shared the same ideals and their love was strong. At that time, rents in Nanjing were high, and civil servants' incomes were meager. Mr. and Mrs. Yu only rented a small room, and even the corridor during the day was used by others. I once visited them. Mr. Yu said that although their material life was hard, he had a strong interest in his work, which shows that his focus on research was the main reason for his later success.

When the August 13th Incident occurred, the enemy indiscriminately bombed Nanjing day and night. Mr. Yu sent his wife and children back to Sheng County first, while he remained at the Mining Office day and night. On the night of September 3rd of that year, a bomb hit the courtyard next door, and the doors and windows of the Mining Office were shattered. The flying tiles and stones almost killed Mr. Yu. After the air raid alarm was lifted, I immediately went to visit him (the Geological Survey and the Mining Office of the National Resources Commission were in the same gate). Mr. Yu, who had just regained his breath, was organizing the mining data and preparing to pack it for transportation. His spirit of not being careless in the face of danger and being responsible to the end was like this.

As the war escalated, the government moved from Nanjing to Wuhan, and from Wuhan to Chongqing. Mr. Yu carried all the books and instruments of the Mining Office, as well as his research records of the past few years, and moved westward. At that time, the Mining Office had been reorganized into the Mining and Metallurgical Research Institute of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and a new laboratory was rebuilt under Heguanyan, more than a hundred miles north of Chongqing, to continue research. However, the war situation took a sharp turn for the worse. North China and the lower reaches of the Yangtze River were abandoned. In the southwest, which was the rear area, a small-scale steel and town industry had to be established to continue the war of resistance. The Jurassic coal seams in Sichuan coal mines that could be used for metallurgical coking were too thin to be mined on a large scale. However, the Permian coal seams, which were thick, had too high sulfur and ash content and could not be used for metallurgy. Therefore, Mr. Yu conducted research and experiments in the laboratory on how to wash and coke the Permian coal with excessively high sulfur content in an economical and simple way, and he finally succeeded. At that time, some small iron smelting furnaces had been opened in Sichuan, and there was an urgent need for metallurgical coking coal. Mr. Yu then used the results of his experiments to establish an experimental coking plant in Maliutan, to supply the needs of various small iron smelting furnaces along the Jialing River. His contribution to the war of resistance and national reconstruction was great.

Mr. Yu was fair and impartial in his work. When running the coking plant, the plant built offices and dormitories for single employees. Although Mr. Yu was the plant director, he did not want to move his family there, but instead rented a simple house from the residents of Shuifengya. In 1941, when I visited Mr. Yu's residence, he already had two sons and a daughter. Due to the high prices, he could not afford to hire help. His wife worked very hard, and Mr. Yu traveled back and forth four times a day, rain or shine, without complaining.

In the winter of 1942, Mr. Yu was ordered by the National Resources Commission to go to the United States to study coal washing and coking. He was ordered to go in a hurry and left hastily. At that time, his wife had just given birth and was isolated in the mountains, lacking care. In addition, prices were soaring, and the salary was not enough to support his four children. A few days after Mr. Yu left, his wife suffered severe stimulation and became mentally deranged. Although various treatments were tried, they were ineffective. Separated by mountains and oceans, and in the midst of the World War, the journey was difficult, and he could not return to Shanghai. After Mr. Yu arrived in the United States, he was disturbed to hear about his wife's illness, but he still focused on his research, so as not to fail the government's expectations. He studied under Mr. Lawless at the Carnegie Institute of Technology in Pittsburgh and often visited various mines for observation.

He gained a lot during his two years in the United States. In March 1945, Mr. Yu returned to China and resumed his old work. He established a larger coking plant in the Tianfu Coal Mine. At that time, the Production Bureau was established, and there was close Sino-American technical cooperation. American coal washing and coking experts were repeatedly sent to China and greatly admired Mr. Yu's design work. There are not many people like Mr. Yu, who have studied, practiced, researched, experimented, set up factories, gone abroad for observation, and then returned to China to expand the factories, in such a proper way with such excellent achievements.

After the victory of the War of Resistance, Mr. Yu was sent to the Northeast to assist in the takeover of the Fushun Coal Mine. After the task was completed, Mr. Yu felt that his expertise was not being used and that his sick wife and weak children were in urgent need of care. He requested leave to go to Sichuan and returned with his family to his native place of Sheng County. At that time, the situation in the Northeast improved, and the steel and machinery industry was about to start. There was an urgent need for a large production of metallurgical coking coal. The National Resources Commission asked Mr. Yu to go to the Northeast again last December to serve as the Chief of the Engineering Office of the Beipiao Coal Mine. The original plan was to greatly increase production to supply washed and coking coal to various steel and machinery factories. Unexpectedly, after he took office, Beipiao was repeatedly besieged by the Communist forces. Mr. Yu, with a strong sense of responsibility, never left the mine after arriving. In early June, I arrived in Fuxin, only two hundred miles from Beipiao. I telegraphed Mr. Yu, intending to meet him and visit the mine, but Mr. Yu replied that Beipiao was still tense and refused me to go. Unexpectedly, this was our last farewell.

Mr. Yu is survived by his sick wife, three sons, and two daughters, all young. The eldest is only thirteen years old. His death is extremely tragic. In his last letter to me last month, Mr. Yu said: "Last year, I returned south from Fushun and originally did not want to come to the Northeast again. Unexpectedly, Mr. Sun firmly insisted that I had to come to Beipiao. I was separated from my family, and there was no one to take care of the children. The monthly income of over 700,000 legal tender is not enough to feed my family. I feel like I am living in a tiger's den..." Reading it now, I am filled with sorrow!

The final paragraph of the article emphasizes that our country has limited talents, and it is not easy to cultivate them. It is hoped that the government will cherish technical talents like Yu Zailin in the future and, when necessary, order the technical personnel to evacuate first to preserve the nation's vitality, so as not to suffer great losses in the war.

### The Calf Without Fear - Sketches of Outer Mongolia

From our news archives.

Outer Mongolia - this emerging nation, is just like a calf that does not fear the tiger. Towards China, including Xinjiang and Fan Huan-yuan, that overbearing attitude is quite astonishing.

Today, the inhabitants of Outer Mongolia are still living nomadic lives of primitive times, but at the same time, livestock farming provides the most nutritious foods for the people of Outer Mongolia, and their nomadic lives have also forged strong physiques for the people of Outer Mongolia. What's more, hidden beneath the vast desert are rich treasures: large amounts of lignite, soda, graphite, gold, silver, copper, iron, lead, antimony, sulfur, asbestos, etc., many of which are very important raw materials.

Outer Mongolia's natural endowment is very thick; it is well known that the Soviet Union covets it. Since the wave of Redness reached the silent and ancient Outer Mongolia, the Mongolian Communists have seized power from the lamas and princes, and established a new administrative system, implementing so-called socialist political and cultural activities in the vast desert area.

### Inquirer's Consultation ¬∑ Recovery of Self-Use After Expiration of Fixed-Term Lease

Dear Editor, I have long admired your column's enthusiastic social service and its ability to solve readers' problems. I have several legal questions that I would like your column to take the time to answer to enlighten me. My friend, Mr. A, rented a spare house to Mr. B two years ago. At that time, it was stated that the term would be three years, and upon expiration, the landlord could unconditionally recover it for self-use. A contract was drawn up at the time with a middleman as witness. Now that the lease term is about to expire, Mr. A intends to recover the house for self-use. I have several questions: (1) (A) Should Mr. A notify Mr. B one month before the expiration of the term to prepare for the move? (B) If Mr. B makes excuses to delay, is it valid for Mr. A to resort to law? (C) When should Mr. A file a lawsuit? What are the procedures? (2) Is the contract established by both parties legally valid? Although the contract has been signed and sealed by both parties and the middleman, the middleman cannot be found. Is the contract still valid? Reader Zhang Zhiping

[Answer from Lawyer Cao Yaxia] (1) (A) Notification should be given. (B) Valid. (C) Upon expiration of the term, a petition should first be submitted to the mediation committee of the district office in charge, or a request for mediation should be filed with the court. If mediation fails, a lawsuit should be filed with the court to confirm the termination of the lease relationship. Concrete proof of recovery for self-use must be provided, otherwise, it may be difficult to win the case. (2) Valid.

### The Formation of "Taiping Guangji"

‚Äî Jing Youlin

Among the novels from the Han and Tang dynasties of China that are still available for our research and reference today, the contribution of "Taiping Guangji" is arguably the greatest. Due to the turmoil and dispersion of materials throughout history, many short passages that appeared in the bibliographies of past dynasties have completely disappeared in our time. In particular, general notebook novels and chuanqi stories, because they were not valued by the literati, were rarely preserved. By the time of Emperor Taizong of Song during the Taiping Xingguo era, the Chongwen Institute, the imperial library, had accumulated over 80,000 volumes. According to the "Remnants of the Song People" compiled, as quoted in "Huiqing Houlou":

"During the Taiping Xingguo era, all the surrendered kings died. Their former officials sometimes had grievances. Emperor Taizong employed them all, placing them in the imperial library to compile books, such as the *Cefu Yuangui*, the *Wenyuan Yinghua*, and the *Taiping Guangji*. He broadened their scope, increased their remuneration, and employed them to occupy their minds, many of whom died in the midst of their textual labors."

Although this passage reveals a sad history, Emperor Taizong's original intention was not for the sake of culture itself. However, in order to prevent the remnants of the Tang dynasty from rebelling again, he ordered the establishment of the Chongwen Institute, widely collecting books from all over the world and accommodating all nostalgic literati in the Chongwen Institute, providing generous support. Thus, literary legacies like "Taiping Guangji" and "Taiping Yulan," which preserved ancient books, were left to us. According to "Taiping Guangji," it collected materials from as many as 345 books, most of which have since been lost, making it a remarkable story in the history of novels.

However, "Taiping Guangji" did not receive the same level of attention as "Taiping Yulan" and "Wenyuan Yinghua" at the time. It is said that in the third month of the second year of Taiping Xingguo, an imperial decree was issued to compile the work, with Li Chu supervising. Xu Xuan, Wu Shu, and twelve others jointly compiled it. In the eighth month of the third year of Taiping Xingguo, the completed work was presented to the imperial court and sent to the historical archives. It remained in the historical archives for more than two years. In the first month of the sixth year, an imperial decree was finally issued to carve the printing plates. Unfortunately, someone who despised novels said to Emperor Taizong: "These remnants are not urgent for later scholars." As a result, the printing was stopped, and the original plates were stored in the Taiqing Tower. This placement lasted even longer. Throughout the entire Song dynasty, "Taiping Guangji" was never made available to the public. It was not until the mid-Ming dynasty that Tan Shi obtained a copy and had it printed and published. Therefore, even the people of the Song dynasty did not see this treasure.

"Taiping Guangji" consists of five hundred volumes, divided into ninety-two categories. It comprehensively collects various tales of foxes and ghosts, accounts of gods and spirits, strange objects and events, special figures, and various notebook novels from the Sui and Tang dynasties. This allows us today to know something about the true face of novels from the Han, Wei, Six Dynasties, Sui, Tang, and Five Dynasties. This treasure has fulfilled its greatest function.

### In the Rain

‚Äî Ge Shangde

The rain was obviously much heavier than when I got on the tram. Water trickled through the cracks in the carriage, wetting the seats. The passengers' faces were filled with anxiety and resentment, but they all remained silently quiet. The carriage was in a state of suppressed breathing.

The tram arrived at a stop, and some passengers braved the rain to get off. Since I had reached my destination, I also got off. Next to the station was a high wall, and only the awning of a newsstand offered temporary shelter. I joined several passengers and hurriedly ran to this awning to escape the rain.

The rain continued to intensify.

The awning was small and crowded. My upper body, being closer to the awning, was somewhat sheltered, but my lower body was getting wet and dirty due to the direct impact of the raindrops and the splashing mud from the water accumulating on the awning and pouring onto the ground.

The awning had some holes, and some of the accumulated water dripped through the holes, making my upper body also slightly wet.

Everyone was anxious, but they remained silent, allowing the heavy rain to control their actions.

Several trams passed by the stop, but no passengers got off. They probably chose a stop with better shelter down the line.

Cars sped through the rain, their tires splashing water like waves. Raindrops hit the street, making a rustling sound.

"Is business good every day?" A young woman who appeared to be a student asked the newsstand owner, breaking the silence among the group of people temporarily gathered together.

"Business is not very good, but we manage to get by," the owner replied.

Only then did I begin to notice the female owner. She was thin, her face even more gaunt, but still somewhat rosy. She wore a blue cloth cheongsam that suited her well. She had rain boots on her feet, without socks. She was about forty years old. Her demeanor was very gentle, and her accent was quite soft. She spoke with a natural smile.

As the two were talking, a car stopped abruptly in front of the newsstand. There was only a driver inside, and he reached out to buy a particular tabloid from the female owner. The female owner skillfully picked out the paper from the rack and handed it to the driver. The car then drove away.

"The old gentleman in this car passes by here every day and always buys a tabloid to read. Sometimes when the air force passes by, the driver buys it for them," the female owner recounted to the young woman.

I lingered under the awning for about half an hour. When the heavy rain turned into a drizzle and the sky began to clear, I left. By then, the other shelter-seekers, including the young woman, had also gradually departed. During that approximately half-hour period, I never saw the female owner express any animosity towards these "uninvited guests." On the contrary, she was always kind and approachable, always showing a genuine smile.

I was deeply moved by her great spirit of "helping others in need."

The next day, it was noon on a day when the scorching sun was raging. I passed by the newsstand again on business. To my disappointment, I did not see the female owner. Instead, a young boy was there, carrying out her duties. I couldn't help but stop and stare at the boy for a long time. He was probably the female owner's child. He was about eleven or twelve years old and quite sturdy. On his round, plump face and in his clear, lively eyes, shone the same warmth, harmony, and sincerity as his mother.

As I left him, I couldn't help but worry about him. The awning that had blocked the rain yesterday would soon be unable to shield him from the scorching sunlight gradually shifting westward. Could he endure the torment of the raging sun?

I sincerely and silently blessed the mother and son!

‚Äî Li Chucai

Leaving Daan at dawn, passing through Mian County, Bao City, Liuba, Miaotai, and Feng County, crossing the Qin Mountains, passing through Dasanguan, Yimen Town, crossing the Wei River, and then entering Chencang.

Two or three li in the sky over Daan, cheap walnuts fill the sandbars; people in the town sleep soundly in their homes, travelers have already crossed thousands of green mountains.

The water around Wuhou Temple flows gently, the traveler's heart is lost beside Mian County; the altar where he claimed kingship to support the Han is gone, but the wind and clouds still swirl around Mount Dingjun.

In Bao City, I ask about farming, noon clouds like cotton batting rise above the mountains; since ancient times, the only comfort is a smile, who knows that the downfall of a kingdom comes from just one bewitching beauty?

Liuba is surprisingly deserted, (the county town was disturbed by bandits in the past, residents were relocated to the surrounding villages, and it is still an empty town today.) I happily see the cypresses thriving in Miaotai; for a thousand years, people have valued the loyalty of Han Xin, I cast a fleeting glance and vainly yearn for the ancients! (Miaotai is located in Zibai Mountain, named after the location of Zhang Liang's temple. The scenery is very beautiful, but I was in a hurry and did not have time to go in and admire it.)

The peaks of Feng County are high, opening in all four directions, (the county town is located in the Fengling Mountains) that year, my elder brother passed by here, most of my family has also passed through, I should offer a cup to the mountain spirits to thank them. (In the early years of the Republic of China, my late father, Mr. Jia Erbaichuan, served as the Daoyin of the Shaanxi Southern Observation Envoy's Office. After the War of Resistance, my wife Huiyun and our children went from Shaanxi to Chongqing. My second nephew, Xiongbo, and his wife and children, who worked at the provincial bank in Hanzhong and Chenggu, also passed through here.)

The Qin clouds cover the Qin Mountains, concealing the Qin Pass, countless bays of mountains under the pass; since ancient times, many have defended this place in war, now I still feel stirred.

The Wei River flows horizontally outside Yimen Town, I have been welcoming Guanhe in my eyes for ten years; I happily arrive at Chencang after crossing the water, the old land of Qin stirs my emotions the most!

### An Emei Minor Song

‚Äî Chang Lan

Milky Way

On a summer night, lying on a bamboo bed, looking at the Milky Way that traverses the night sky, only the sweet memories of childhood will be brought to you.

Memory, like a misty dusk, is as ethereal as a dream, clear, but when you try to capture it, it is like a cunning spirit, quietly slipping away, leaving you without a trace. ...

On such a night, I thought of that lost childhood, thought of the stories about the Milky Way on that summer night.

...The sunflower bid farewell to the setting sun and drooped its head sadly. The weaver and some small insects of unknown names sang monotonous elegies for the lost daylight.

The sultriness will disappear in the bursts of evening breeze, and we innocently ask our grandmother to tell us the story of the Milky Way.

Grandmother, with a face covered with wrinkles, smiled kindly, she said:

In ancient times, a herdboy and a weaving girl in heaven, how they built a deep love, it is said that when their "fate" was full, the Queen Mother of the West‚Äîthat cruel old woman‚Äîused her silver hairpin to draw a deep chasm on the firmament, that bright silver chasm, is the Milky Way. This great trench cruelly separated the lovers in passionate love. Only those kind birds, at the deep noon on July 7th, built a light magpie bridge for them, so that they could pour out the feelings they had accumulated in their hearts for years. Their tears flowed and turned into raindrops....

We all listened silently, stirring slight waves in our childhood hearts, and we began to lament the ups and downs of fate for that couple.

...Old grandmother has left us for many years, only that Milky Way that shines brightly in the night sky is still the same as it used to be.

Let me pray for the soul of my grandmother to rest in peace, and let me bless that affectionate couple.

Fireflies

Fireflies, flying in the summer night, although their brilliance is so weak and small. But they brought children so much joy and excitement.

When the moon is bright and hangs in the middle of the sky, when the stars are shining brightly. You may ignore the existence of fireflies, maybe you saw them, but you despise their smallness and weak light, but when there are no stars and moon at night, their preciousness can be revealed.

But the fireflies do not care about this, they fly, they use their weak light to mark many small loopholes in the whole night.

They do not exaggerate their abilities, seeking to complete the feeling of "I am the only one," nor do they despise themselves, scorning their own incompetence. A pioneer once said, "If you have one point of light, give off one point of heat." Fireflies complete the fulfillment of life and the meaning of work.

Lament

The new moon, like an eyebrow, makes people think of the brilliance on the face of a saint, and think of the innocent faces of children.

Moonlight, like light gauze, covers the noise of the world. It is quiet, gentle, but she uses her affectionate hands to open the gates of memory for every dreamy person.

The past years seem to be a plain white and beautiful flower, blooming in a distant, unattainable place. Far away on the other side of the mountain, on the other side of the water, a friend makes me draw a wisp of long silk of longing... These, for me, seem to have an inseparable blood relationship with the moonlit night, because, I regret that "the long string of stories played under the moon, I remember the past like smoke, I remember that companion who scattered like a meteor in an unknowable place. .............

Who is it? Singing a pair of songs on the other side of the forest.

I have a beautiful illusion.

Lost beside the meteor...

‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶

‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶

Tonight, are you still standing by the window, letting the moon, like water, melt into your eyes as deep as the sea?

Tonight, a chilling melancholy, mixed with the light of the new moon, quietly flows from the depths of my heart....

‚Äî Sezanne

Cezanne (Paul Cezanne 1839-1906) was a famous painter of the nineteenth century, the founder of modern painting, but he was a person who never entered an art school and came out entirely by self-study. He was naturally withdrawn and arrogant, and he rarely looked up to anyone except Zola (Emilezola).

He denied the impressionist claim of being enslaved by "light," and he further described the quality and quantity of "objects" other than light in a subjective attitude. He made figures, still lifes, and landscapes, but still lifes were the most famous. This work is a representative work of figure painting in the mature period.

### Random Collection of Figures

‚Äî Zhongyuan

Flower

She is an eighteen-year-old girl.

The first time I saw her in the hazy moonlight, her long, oval face was as white as if it had been smeared with cream. She had two short braids, waved a hexagonal fan, saw me, smiled, and followed her sixty-year-old American "Grandma" and came over: "Wellcome!". It is a delicate and gentle fragrance.

So familiar! Familiar, but I can't remember it. I rashly held her little hand and asked, "Do you know me?"

"Of course I know! Isn't your name called √ó√ó√ó?"

"Yes! How do you know me?"

"In Mogan Mountain; in Suzhou; and in many publications and magazines..."

"Oh!..."

I blushed with shame. How could I not! This innocent girl said she knew me. Know my poverty? Know my stubbornness? Or know my...?‚Ä¶

I lowered my head and was speechless.

The "party" began, and the girl sang softly. Her voice was soft at first; then it was loud; finally, like a flying arrow rushing straight into the sky, and then quickly trembling and falling; then the whole world and the moon seemed to change color!

On the way home, my friend and I discussed the girl.

"It's amazing! This girl will definitely be a great singer when she returns from studying abroad!" my friend said excitedly.

"Yes, maybe," I replied.

"She is so beautiful, really like a beautiful little warbler!" my friend said again.

"Yes, she is very beautiful. But she is not a beautiful little warbler, but a beautiful carnation!" I said.

"Why are you so stubborn?" my friend laughed: "Little warblers, carnations, birds and flowers, aren't they all cute? What's the difference?"

I gently replied to my friend:

"There is a difference, birds soar in the free sky, sing loudly for their own happiness, and dance for their own joy. Flowers will always thrive in wet mud and be grasped in the hands of flower arrangers. Do you envy the noble bouquet of carnations in the bride's hand! Why don't you go and see the firm lead wire firmly tied behind them!"

Saying that, I sighed inexplicably, so my friend was also silent.

Dog

I don't know if it's because everyone calls him "Ah Gou", his body gradually looks like a dog.

His head is bent downwards, his cheekbones are raised, and his two incomplete ears are strangely curled up. A high thing bulged on his back, and a young master from a neighboring family who could write poetry saw it and shouted, "A terrible decapitation blade is tightly pressed on his thin back!"

But Ah Gou didn't understand anything, he raised his head in fear and asked, "Young master! Do you still need to pull weeds in the flower circle today?"

Ah Gou's hoarse and unpleasant voice drove away the young master's "poetic mood", he got angry, and waved his hand: "I don't know, go ask the wife!"

The wife said it was needed, Ah Gou jumped up happily, as if God allowed him: "You can live one more day!"

So Ah Gou smiled, he went to the garden to pull weeds with a pleasant smile.

I also smiled, I went to the window with a faint bitter smile to watch him pull weeds.

I saw the thick and hard weeds growing deep in the soil, Ah Gou hummed and pulled hard. ‚Ä¶

I saw the fiery sun hanging high in the sky, and the sweat on Ah Gou's back was flowing like rain. ‚Ä¶

I saw the garden door suddenly opened, a child in western clothes and a pair of fashionable Pekingese dogs jumped in. "Woof woof woof..." The Pekingese dogs rushed towards Ah Gou, wanting to bite him.

"Young master..." Ah Gou cried out in a hurry.

"Hahahaha!" It was the young master's burst of hearty laughter.

Ah Gou was running, the Pekingese dogs were chasing, and the young master was clapping and following behind.

They ran too fast, chased too fast, and followed too fast. In the strong sunlight, it was gradually impossible to see clearly! I only saw three white and heavy things, turning quickly in the garden...

"Which pair is the dog?" I asked myself at my window.

"Which one is the dog?" I am still asking myself today.

### One Inch of Mountain, One Inch of River, One Inch of Blood

‚Äî Ye Jingfeng

"Alas!" Yaojun seemed to have been heavily hammered in the heart; even an ordinary girl, discovering the evidence of unrequited love for the first time, was not as disappointed and uncomfortable as she was at this moment.

"That can't be blamed on you," I quickly comforted her: "I know you have made the greatest efforts; in other words, even if Mr. Tsurumi or Mr. W were to exchange places with you, they would probably only be able to do this much, maybe even less."

"..." Yaojun's lips trembled, wanting to say something, but she didn't say it.

"You know I never tell lies, and I never like to flatter people... Lies are useless to you and will only delay things... Anyway, I'm here now, maybe I can't do anything else, but I guarantee the speed of communications‚Äîyou know, I've already exchanged messages four or five times yesterday."

"No wonder you wanted to exchange information as soon as you arrived. I thought you wanted to know a little bit about what happened last night... It turns out my reports have been suppressed by the postal and telegraph bureaus. Even in wartime, they shouldn't be suppressed so slowly, it's really unexpected... Counting to last night, there are at least ten important reports‚Äîboth postal and telegraph‚ÄîI think that is the usual way of Anchang." Yaojun's spirit had recovered a lot, but she was not as happy as just now.

Yaojun then sent out the reports that had already been sent, picking out the most important ones, and I listened and wrote them down. After Yaojun finished speaking, I reviewed the few items I had written down again, and after obtaining Yaojun's consent, I called Dasanzi "04" and told him to send these messages to the two secret stations in Beiping and Tokyo using our usual code, and also asked him to add a message stating that I and Yaojun and others had met; we would talk about the rest later. When "04" was about to leave, I asked Little Tiger to guide him to find the car he needed and to get back here before twelve o'clock, bringing back more food‚ÄîI was planning to have a good talk with Yaojun and Dingyuan, and then plan the work to be done.

Little Tiger and Dasanzi went out together; but only a few minutes later, Little Tiger suddenly returned; I thought he had forgotten something, or had something to ask. I was looking at him when I saw his round eyes roll twice, and he smiled and told us, "Captain Shen said he knew the way and also knew the big tree where the car was parked, so..."

Yaojun smiled when she heard it. Looking at her expression, I knew that this little thing was not honest and must be lying. But in fact, he can't be blamed. He was definitely not lazy, but because we were all here, he was a little reluctant to leave; partly he wanted to listen to our conversation, and partly, it was the nature of a child, who likes to join in the fun. For these two reasons, he probably told Dasanzi the route and the parking location, telling him to find it himself; but he was also afraid that Yaojun and I would blame him, so he used Dasanzi as a scapegoat.

"Very good," Yaojun looked at her watch and said to Little Tiger, "It's almost eight o'clock now. I was originally scheduled to talk to that Shaofu buyer, but now I'll trouble you to take a trip and tell him at the office that I can't leave and ask him to come back at five or six o'clock in the afternoon. If he hasn't arrived yet, you can inform Lao Long and ask him to tell him instead... Go and come back."

Shanghai Vignettes

### Shanghai Residents Spending Summer

‚Äî Shi Lang

Reading "New Yorkers Spending Summer" fills one with a myriad of emotions.

Many people yearn for the luxurious life in Shanghai: air conditioning, cold drinks, watermelons, refrigerators‚Ä¶ who wouldn't be moved? When talking about living, there are garden villas; when talking about entertainment, there are classy dance halls; when talking about eating, there are rich and comfortable dining seats‚Ä¶ However, these are merely for the enjoyment of a small number of wealthy and privileged families.

When New Yorkers reach the "dog days" of over a hundred degrees, the whole family goes to the beach to have a great time. There, regardless of age, status, or wealth, during this "summer break" weather, they spend several evenings by the surging waves and soft, grassy sand of the beach. How can that not dispel the heat?

But, for Shanghai residents, let alone beach swimming, what fraction of them can even afford to go to a swimming pool?

Some people don't even have a place to wash off the sweat every day. A basin the size of a washbasin for a quick wash is already considered "keeping up with the times." The equipment of "porcelain basins" and "shower heads" is beyond their imagination.

And once night falls, they are squeezed onto the streets in "pigeon coops" as if scorched by fire. Other than enjoying a bit of evening breeze in a breezy spot, where else can they go to spend this hot and stifling long night?

Especially those coolies, rickshaw pullers, sweating profusely at the docks, carrying heavy loads, pulling carts, carrying heavy burdens, letting the sun of around a hundred degrees scorch their skin, while those cold drinks with raw water bacteria, with the hand of "death", beckon to them!

This scorching and merciless fire is burning more than three million distressed Shanghai residents. Above their heads, under their feet, around them, it's all fire-like heat!

Epidemics, acute illnesses, are following them, attacking them. In these hot summers, they have already lost the ability to resist.

Can you imagine those barefoot coolies and rickshaw pullers on the asphalt roads, flying around?

You cannot possibly imagine how Shanghai residents spend their summer.

Personalities

### Anecdotes of Zhang Jia'ao

‚Äî Meng Long

My knowledge of Zhang Jia'ao dates back more than twenty years. At that time, he seemed to be in the form of a businessman, and his name was not known to the world as "Jia'ao." Everyone called him "Mr. Gongquan." Perhaps because of this reason, some people jokingly referred to "Gongquan" as a business name, and considered "Jia'ao" as an official name. In reality, it is one and two, two and one. This is the same as being called "Zhou Shuren" ("Yucai") when working at the Ministry of Education, and "Lu Xun" when writing articles. There is no distinction between official, private, political, or business, and no mystery involved.

But Zhang Jia'ao has his own mysterious side. According to a friend, he has many special hobbies, and the arrangement of his home is very unique to suit his hobbies. For example, when you enter his reception room, you may realize that he is a prominent financier with a taste. In the past, many years ago, I can't remember exactly, a friend designed a wonderful carpet for him. Its style and pattern are exactly the same as the pattern on the five-yuan banknote of the Bank of China, except that it is enlarged a hundred times in area. If viewed by a nearsighted person, it would be mistaken for a banknote lying on the floor.

Regarding his marriage, many mysterious stories are also circulating in society. As far as I know, since the outbreak of the War of Resistance, Zhang Jia'ao has moved inland with the national army to serve the country. He has won wide praise for his work in the economic war of resistance. At that time, his family members, including his wife, Madam Chen, stayed behind, still living in a fairly luxurious mansion on Ga'en Road. At that time, it was generally speculated that Mrs. Zhang had moved west with Mr. Zhang, but this was just wishful thinking, because she rarely went out and had little contact with the outside world, so it was not noticed by people. Unfortunately, her life was taken away by illness the year before last, and Zhang Jia'ao's grief is beyond words. Ms. Chen came from a prominent family. She was the daughter of Chen Baiwan, a well-known figure in Shanghai during the late Qing Dynasty. When they got married, it caused a sensation inside and outside Shanghai, and it was said that Ms. Chen's dowry was so abundant that it amounted to "eighteen Arhats." Although this is not true, the luxurious situation can indeed be inferred from this.

The problem of remarriage has always been a matter of Zhang Jia'ao's daily consideration. This marriage between Zhou Bixia and Zhang can be regarded as a renewal of old acquaintances and a repayment of a debt of love. The new wife, Ms. Bixia, is good at socializing. When she flew from Ping to Shanghai this time, she refused to show her face and covered her face with a fan. Secretary Lu from the Central Bank even labored to defend her, saying that she was not Mrs. Zhang but Mrs. Zhu. Therefore, many people were confused. Many people thought that Mrs. Zhang was shy and afraid of people talking about the interesting story of "white hair and rosy cheeks," or the comparison of pear blossoms and crabapples. In fact, readers don't need to worry about her. She is well-known in the social circle and has a close friendship with Zhang's two younger sisters. She has known Mr. Zhang for several years. Last year, there was once a rumor that they had secretly married in Shanghai, but it was soon said to be untrue. All these rumors added a lot of mystery to the marriage process of Zhang and Zhou. The main reason is not because of "white hair and rosy cheeks," but because Mr. Zhang is engaged in politics and is afraid of affecting reporters' coverage.

### The Growth of Hair

‚Äî Dongfang Jing

Humans have hair from the moment they sit down, and they take it to the coffin when they die. However, in between birth and death, people know very little about hair. This is truly an inexcusable ignorance.

A fetus starts to grow hair six months before birth. Hair stops growing only when the heart stops beating. It is a misconception that the hair of dead people can also grow because it is the contraction of the muscle tissue of the dead that leads to the mistaken belief that the hair is still growing.

Sunlight has no relation to the structure and amount of hair, and cutting hair has no effect on hair growth.

The color of hair is determined by a pigment that the human body makes itself and stores in the hair follicles. Decreased pigment production in the body causes hair to gradually turn gray or white. Individual hairs do not fade, but after they fall out, the hairs that grow back contain less pigment.

Premature graying is often due to the following three reasons: (1) insufficient hair pigment in the body; (2) severe nervous system diseases, including excessive worry and anxiety; (3) suffering from typhoid fever and other diseases.

Currently, science has no way to enable the human body to produce enough pigment. Vitamin treatment or other medical methods are ineffective.

The ancients said, "Anger makes the hair stand on end." We all thought it was just a literary description. However, in fact, hair can stand up one by one. When we are greatly frightened or cold, the hair stands up.

Hair has a lot of pulling power. A single hair can hold a quarter of a pound of weight. At the same time, hair is elastic. It can be stretched by one-fifth and can shrink back like a rubber band. According to experiments, wet hair can be stretched by 70% without breaking. In steam and boiling water, hair can be stretched by 100%.

Hair grows fastest when it first comes out of the scalp, averaging three-quarters of an inch per month. Then it grows more slowly. The lifespan of hair is about six months to four years, but a new hair grows out immediately after the old one falls out. Even if you pull the hair out by the roots, new hair will still grow, but it will take six to twelve weeks to grow out.

If you want to dye your hair, you should think twice. Dermatologists believe that any dye is harmful to hair and will make hair lose its natural shine. As for perms, they are harmful and unprofitable except for the hairdresser.

If hair falls out after a major illness, it doesn't matter. Once the body is fully recovered, the hair will grow back.

There are about four ways to keep your hair healthy: (1) comb your hair more often; (2) massage your scalp more often; (3) wash your hair often to keep your scalp clean; (4) avoid emotional obstacles.

Mrs. Deng and Mrs. He had not met for several months. "I heard," Mrs. Deng said, "that your son and your daughter are both married, congratulations!"

"Thank you," Mrs. He said.

"How is your daughter? How is she doing these days?"

"Very good," Mrs. He replied. "She has a very good and considerate husband. She has breakfast in bed every day, and she doesn't even have to lift a finger for anything. Every afternoon, she goes shopping after eating, and then plays cards. She is truly a blessed woman."

"Then, what about your son?" Mrs. Deng continued to ask.

Mrs. He sighed and said, "Alas, my son, that child is so pitiful. I'm afraid he's not doing very well these days. His wife is so lazy, a born lazybones. She doesn't get up until ten o'clock every day, and she doesn't even move a finger for anything in the house. Every afternoon, she spends most of the day playing cards. Alas, Mrs. Deng, she is truly a lazy slut!"

### Liang Zu and the Big Willow Tree

‚Äî You Jin

Those who are used to hearing flattering words cannot listen to honest advice. However, the principle that "bitter medicine is good for illness, and frank words are beneficial for conduct" is clearly and plainly there.

Zou Ji of Qi knew that his appearance was not as beautiful as Mr. Xu of the north of the city, but his wife favored him, his concubine feared him, and his friends asked him for favors. They all praised him, saying that he was more beautiful than Mr. Xu of the north of the city. This made Zou Ji realize the harm of being blinded. He advised the King of Qi with this, so that Qi could happily accept the truth and not be blinded by flattering words. As a result, the State of Qi "won battles in the court." This is the best positive example.

Generally, those who are good at flattering do not understand the righteousness; people who understand the righteousness mostly do not like to be flattered by others. Historically, the distinction between loyal and treacherous officials lies only in whether they are willing to speak frankly.

Ming Zheng Xuan's Yesterday's Non-Hermitage Compilation contains the following short story:

"Liang Zu wanted to seek out honest and frank men. One day, he suddenly stopped under a tall willow tree. The trees were countable.

Liang Zu said to himself: What a big willow bridge! He stared at the guests for a long time. The guests each avoided their seats and replied: What a big willow tree! Zu also said: It can be used as a cart shaft. Several people in the last seat rose and replied: It is good to be a cart shaft. Zu said sternly: How can a willow tree be used as a cart shaft! Qin Shi pointed at a deer and called it a horse, is there anything more difficult than this! All those who said it could be used as a cart shaft were killed. Alas! To die for speaking honestly, what is the benefit of flattering!"

The guests mentioned here who echoed the voice, like parrots learning to speak, were of roughly two types; one was desperately flattering, taking yes-saying as loyalty, hoping to win favor by echoing the voice, fearing to offend the will of the superiors. The other was mediocre, like a cold toad croaking, even though they knew in their hearts that it was wrong, they were unable to speak out, and could only follow suit and say "What a big willow tree" and "It is good to be a cart shaft."

However, the crime of pointing to a deer and calling it a horse is the greatest. Liang Zu killed them all indiscriminately, which was certainly enough to be a warning and a secret. However, it was inevitable to blame people silently. If he really wanted people to speak frankly and dare to pick out faults, why didn't he openly say: "Don't do the same as before and specialize in echoing, you should speak out your true thoughts." I think someone among the guests would definitely dare to say that the willow tree cannot be used as a cart shaft. Why set up a tree in vain to show one's own fondness for killing? Liang Zu's approach was so wrong that it was simply unreasonable.

"The crime of lengthening the ruler's evil is small, the crime of echoing the ruler's evil is great." Following behind Liang Zu and echoing like a mouthpiece, killing them all indiscriminately is certainly not completely unjust, but to seek honest and frank men, to actually adopt such means, is something that later generations dare not compliment.

Genuine democracy should be like the gentle breeze under the willow tree, with harmony as the priority. To set up "What a big willow tree" and "It is good to be a cart shaft" to trick guests into being fooled, and then to kill them, is a kind of violent atmosphere. As a result, honest and frank men are bound to be nowhere to be found.

### Between Husband and Wife

‚Äî Ming Sen

Economic problems‚ÄîE.D. Maurer studied 466 divorce cases, and he found that economic difficulties were the main cause in 30 to 40 percent of them. However, G.V. Hamilton, in his book "A Research on Marriage," put forward another explanation: disputes over money are often just manifestations of other fundamental disharmonies in married life.

Women who are unhappy after marriage often look for excuses to express their dissatisfaction. She will never think that she might have some fault; she just nitpicks and looks for her husband's shortcomings. And using economic problems to nag him is one of the most convenient excuses.

Poor health‚ÄîIf it is true, this can be regarded as the most understandable reason for the wives to be garrulous. Many women keep their complaints until their menstrual period comes, and then they erupt once or several times regardless. Some women use illness as an excuse to avoid sexual life that they hate, or as an excuse for not being good housewives. When they feel unwell, garrulous women believe that they have every right to make some complaints.

Donna Wright's simple principle for achieving happiness between couples is: "Show affection! Show appreciation!" Learn to tolerate others, their thoughts, desires, and lifestyles.

Scientific Essay

### The Wonderful Life of Cockroaches (Part 1)

‚Äî Tianhong

"Paleontologists" who carefully study fossils of prehistoric animals often see a small animal that they are very familiar with‚Äîthe cockroach‚Äîwith traces of prints on it. Of the countless animals that lived in the Paleozoic "Carboniferous Period," from the huge and terrifying "dinosaurs," only cockroaches have survived to this day. It has experienced 216 million years of great changes and disasters, and not only still exists, but has hardly changed or evolved at all.

Most people find cockroaches to be filthy and disgusting things, often coming to our homes as uninvited guests, annoyingly sharing our food and dormitories. But let us say a fair word for it: it is a very clever and intelligent little animal‚Äîit is entirely by its own intelligence that it has triumphed over dinosaurs and huge prehistoric animals and multiplied to the present. It is the old senior in the insect world; in the way of life, it can even give us humans many lessons.

The secret that has enabled cockroaches to continue to exist for more than 200 million years is, first of all, that their sex life is wisely moderate. Most insects continue to engage in courtship and reproduction after they grow up, consuming all their energy. Cockroaches are not like this. They only mate in spring. As soon as their offspring are born, they make a nest for them and lovingly take care of them until they can live independently.

At least in one respect, the way of life of cockroaches is superior to that of humans: they never fight among themselves, but know how to respect the rights of other members of their kind. If a nest of cockroaches has established a family in a certain corner, other cockroaches will not invade it. They will not even kill each other over delicious food.

Cockroaches are not particular about food at all; they will eat anything. Powder mud on the walls, broken old shoes and cardboard boxes, plaster lime, medicines... are all listed on its acceptable food list. Even for ink, oilcloth, and torn cloth scraps, it will be as happy as if it had seen meat, bread, and potatoes. Sometimes, seemingly for novelty, it will sneak onto you while you are sleeping and nibble on your eyelashes and fingernails.

And when times are bad, cockroaches can eat nothing at all. A scientist once locked a cockroach in a large bottle without giving them any food; after seventy-six days, they were still alive. When he released them, they were very weak from hunger and their bodies were emaciated! But they did not immediately gobble up and overeat themselves to death; in the first few days after being released, they only ate a little food until their digestion returned to normal, and then gradually increased their food intake.

Sources of funding for American schools

China, known to the world for its long-standing culture, seems to have reached the point of bankruptcy in education. Schools are bound to raise tuition fees due to a shortage of funds. Ordinary poor students are forced to beg for scholarships on the streets, which truly fits the saying "culture swept the floor." Studying in this environment is bound to be asking for trouble. American schools are not as grand as Chinese schools in architecture, and they do not have as many faculty and staff as Chinese schools. In addition to running schools seriously, they are not very interested in political struggles and party disputes, and they are even less willing to treat schools as battlefields. American private schools do not receive much help from the government. But they also have abundant funds, which are not raised by students begging along the way, but are mostly donated by wealthy people. Since the implementation of income tax and inheritance tax in the United States, wealth has been greatly hit. In order to avoid heavy taxes, the wealthy would rather donate most of their property to schools. On the one hand, they can evade taxes, and on the other hand, they can enjoy fame, which is much more glorious than paying into the national treasury silently. Therefore, famous universities such as Jianfo have the richest school property in the world, and they cannot use it all in another hundred years. There is a Rice Institute in Xiaoshi Dun, which was donated by an oil tycoon. The land covers thousands of acres, and students are completely free of charge and receive subsidies. However, the admission standards are extremely high. This is a university for high-achieving students, and those who want to mix diplomas cannot enter. Texas Provincial School is also famous for its rich school property, and Texas is a coal and oil producing area. Many ordinary people have become giant merchants overnight because oil mines have been opened on their pastures, and they take money very lightly. Donating tens of thousands of dollars is not a big deal. Americans have a strange temper. They would rather donate all their property to schools than let their children be cattle and horses. The opposite is true for Orientals. There are many tycoons in Shanghai who gnaw on pancakes and fried dough sticks all day long, but their children squander money in dance halls and casinos. If the education authorities can use their brains in this regard, many students will be saved from sweating and weeping in the scorching sun. (3) (1)
