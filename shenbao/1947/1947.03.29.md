### Central Government Commemorates Revolutionary Martyrs; Chairman Chiang Publishes Letter to Youth, Encouraging Dedication to National Salvation, Unity, and Stability

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 28th Dispatch] The central government, in commemoration of the National Revolution Martyrs' Memorial Day and Youth Day, will hold a memorial ceremony at the National Government at 9:00 AM on the 29th. Chairman Chiang will preside. Starting at 11:00 AM, sacrifices will be made at Linggu Temple. Central Committee members in Nanjing, party and government personnel, and personnel from the Army, Navy, and Air Force will all participate. From 7:00 PM to 10:00 PM, the Beijing branch of the Youth League and the National Chengchi University will host a World Youth Education Evening, with representatives from fourteen countries participating. Furthermore, the Beijing branch of the Youth League will organize a spring outing on the 29th, with Tangshan as the destination.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 28th Dispatch] The 29th is the fourth Youth Day. Chairman Chiang published a letter to the youth of the nation, the original text of which is as follows: Today is the memorial day of the 72 martyrs of Huanghuagang, and it is also a revolutionary memorial day for striving for the equality and freedom of the Chinese nation, for the unification and independence of the Republic of China, and for the realization of the Three Principles of the People: of the people, by the people, and for the people. The martyrs' heroic sacrifice and courageous dedication established an eternal and imperishable glory for our Chinese nation, and created an unshakable foundation for our Republic of China for all ages. We commemorate the martyrs and encourage the youth, so four years ago, we specifically designated today as Chinese Youth Day. All patriotic Chinese youth, on this glorious memorial day, should admire the revolutionary martyrs, cherish revolutionary history, and work together with a united and active effort to carry forward and expand the Republic of China created by our martyrs and the revitalized Chinese nation, so that we may not be unworthy of being revolutionary followers of our Founding Father, and to comfort the heroic spirits of our revolutionary martyrs. This year's Youth Day is precisely when our democratic constitution has been announced and the work of unification is being actively promoted. Our youth must naturally be encouraged and inspired to commemorate the glorious achievements of the revolutionary martyrs' struggle, and strive to be the cadres who build our Republic of China. However, reflecting on the current situation in the country, in the past year, national unity has been greatly damaged and the people's lives have been greatly distressed. I believe that our revolutionary youth with courage and integrity will commemorate this festive day with a heavy heart. We often say, "The blood of the martyrs is the flower of the revolution." Recalling the year when our Youth Day began, it was the most intense and critical year of the war of resistance against Japan. Patriotic youth across the country inherited the fragrance of Huanghuaâ€™s green blood and emulated the martyrs' dedication to national salvation. Immediately after the establishment of Youth Day, there was the great event of 100,000 educated youth joining the army, which made the world look at Chinese youth with new eyes. Later, the Youth Army's arduous and glorious achievements on the battlefields of Yunnan and Burma fulfilled the task of winning the war of resistance, demonstrating that once the strength of Chinese educated youth is gathered and brought into play, it can make unlimited contributions to the country. Immediately following the victory of the war of resistance against Japan, the most urgent needs of our country were unity and stability, and post-war reconstruction. This war was an unprecedented large-scale war, and it was also an unprecedentedly brutal war. China fought for the longest time and suffered the most severe damage, and its need for unity, stability, and post-war reconstruction is also the most urgent. I once stated that "To improve the lives of our compatriots lies in construction, to overcome economic difficulties lies in construction, to eliminate the pain of unemployment lies in construction, to consolidate the foundation of the country, and maintain the glory of victory, also lies in construction." In order to ensure that our post-war reconstruction can be carried out smoothly, the central government has spared no effort to seek a foundation for peaceful unification, and has tried in every way to compromise in order to awaken those who create division and destroy unification. Unfortunately, all peace talks have been rejected by the Communist Party. A year and a half of efforts after the victory of the war of resistance have all come to nothing, causing chaos to increase daily and the people's lives to become more difficult. The glory of the victory of the war of resistance will be lost because of this, and the independent and equal status of the nation will also be greatly affected. This behavior of the Communist Party destroys the unification of the country and hinders the progress of construction. It is not only a criminal against our revolutionary martyrs, but also a traitor to our nation. Under this situation, our patriotic youth must make effective contributions to the country and the nation, and must choose their own path.

### Adhere to a Pure Stance

The path for young people to serve the country is certainly not just one, but the most urgent need for the country and the people lies in construction. After the victory of the war of resistance, our greatest task is to build the country, and the foundation of building the country lies in unification. Without unification, the country cannot carry out construction, the people cannot live and work in peace, and the nation cannot obtain equal and free status. Therefore, the primary task for our youth to serve the country today is to strive to create an environment of unification. The so-called environment of unification must be stable in order, not chaotic. In thought and action, it must be active, not destructive. The reason why the independence, equality, and dignity of our country have not been universally respected after the victory of the war of resistance is because the Communist Party has launched an armed rebellion, occupied territory, disrupted society, harmed the people, and destroyed unification. Therefore, the nation has suffered such great humiliation today. Now, if our youth want to wash away this shame, it cannot be achieved by a momentary emotional impulse alone. We must fight against the forces that oppose unification and construction. We must make every effort to promote national unification and create social stability. We must adhere to our pure stance and develop our patriotic virtues. We must prevent political careerists from using schools and factories as places of struggle. Therefore, we must respect academic freedom, maintain social order, and increase national production for the sake of the country and the nation. First of all, we must make ourselves independent and unwavering youth, and create a good environment for genuine learning in our educational institutions. Do not act rashly because of stimulation, and do not blindly follow incitement. Schools are the model of society. If schools can be stable, they can further help to achieve social stability. Only with such active and stable forces can a unified environment be established. Only in this way can our country not be despised by others, our national construction can proceed smoothly, and our youth will have a path to employment and service to the country.

Secondly, our youth must strive to study and make full preparations for construction work. The Founding Father often said, "To be determined to make a revolution, one must have profound knowledge as the foundation." The Founding Father's leadership of the revolution throughout his life, and his great achievements, were all due to his profound knowledge. Today, the construction needed by our country is truly complex and extensive. The rapid progress of science, technology, and industry in modern countries is happening at an astonishing pace. Whether we talk about production and construction or social progress, we are far behind. Patriotic youth across the country must know that if we talk about national humiliation, this is the root of national humiliation. If we talk about responsibility, this is the greatest responsibility of the youth. We must seize this youth, catch up quickly, and strive to learn. Only by acquiring profound knowledge can we make genuine contributions to national construction. Furthermore, it is important to know that respecting teachers and valuing the Way is the basis for obtaining practical benefits from learning, and fostering a good school spirit by constantly improving and not being complacent is the foundation for students to learn from each other and improve their morals. We must not fail this great era, and we must not waste our extremely valuable life. We must have the spirit of "If not me, who?" to make the effort to catch up.

### Recognize the Responsibilities of the Era, Clearly Distinguish Between Right and Wrong, and Understand Advantages and Disadvantages

Strive for Self-Salvation and National Salvation

Patriotic youth across the country, youth are the pioneers who create the era, and they are the new life of the nation. In China, the first to advocate revolution, from the Founding Father onwards, such as Lu Haodong and Shi Jianru and other martyrs, were all youth. The 72 martyrs of Huanghuagang were also mostly youth. The Xinhai Revolution, the Northern Expedition of the 15th year, and this war of resistance against Japan, most of those who contributed the most lives and strength were also youth. Chinese youth have already written a glorious record in history, enough to be immortalized with our Chinese nation. Now, although the war of resistance has ended, national construction has not yet succeeded. The current era is an era of construction. The country needs you to build it, and needs you to establish brilliant achievements in construction and create a bright future. You must rejuvenate your spirit and strive actively. You must never drift along with the crowd or belittle yourselves. Furthermore, it is important to know that the country has entered the early stages of democratic constitutionalism and must guarantee the independence of academia in order to maintain a good environment for youth to study. Therefore, you must not waste your good years and abundant energy on pessimistic emotions of wandering frustration and fruitless political struggles. You should recognize the era, recognize your responsibilities. Those who disrupt society and harm the people are traitors to our country. Those who destroy unification and hinder construction are the scum of our nation. Whoever disrupts our order, stifles our vitality, prevents our students from studying, prevents our farmers from cultivating, prevents our workers from working, and prevents our merchants from doing business, is the public enemy of our people. We must clearly distinguish between right and wrong, analyze advantages and disadvantages, shoulder responsibility for the country, and bear the mission for the times. On this glorious memorial day, we should also remember the unwavering character of the revolutionary martyrs and emulate the spirit of the revolutionary martyrs who sacrificed themselves for the country, in order to transform the environment of construction, support the forces of stability, complete unification, and be loyal to the country. Only in this way will we not be unworthy of the meaning of establishing Youth Day. Youth across the country, as we hold Youth Day in such a chaotic and devastated environment in the country, I hope that you can all set your ambitions, make up your minds, work together, and strive for self-salvation and national salvation.

### Chairman Chiang to go to Hangzhou Soon; Received Egyptian Envoy in Nanjing Yesterday

[Our Newspaper, Hangzhou, 28th Dispatch] Chairman Chiang will come to Zhejiang soon. Chiang Ching-kuo arrived in Zhenhai on the 28th, while Yuan Qingbi, the head of the General Affairs Section of the National Government, went to Fenghua. The Jianqiao Air Force Academy will hold a public memorial service on the 29th for the martyrs who died in the war of resistance. Commander-in-Chief Zhou will fly to preside over the service. Chairman Chiang may come along.

[United Press, Washington, 27th Dispatch] Regarding the rumor that Chairman Chiang will visit Washington and London, both the White House and the Chinese Embassy said they had not heard of it. Presidential Press Secretary Ross said: This news is "news to me as well."

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 28th Dispatch] Chairman Chiang received the Egyptian Ambassador to China, Ismail, at his residence at 4:00 PM on the 28th. He inquired in detail about the recent situation in Egypt and expressed regret that he did not meet with the King of Egypt when he went to Egypt to attend the Cairo Conference in 1943. When Chairman Chiang received the Egyptian ambassador, our newly appointed ambassador to Egypt, He Fengshan, was also present.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 28th Dispatch] Minister Zhang Lisheng recently told our reporter about the principles of reorganizing the government, saying: It is rumored that a certain party wants a certain department of the government, but nothing has been decided yet. However, in terms of the principles of reorganization, whether in the UK or the US, the entry of political parties into the cabinet involves changes in political officials, not changes in administrative officials. If a country's civil service system is well-established, there is no need to change it due to changes in political parties. Therefore, the reorganization of the government only involves political officials and does not involve administrative officials.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 28th Dispatch] A certain government official revealed that the reorganization of the State Council Committee is waiting for the lists of the Democratic Socialist Party and the Youth Party to be submitted before it can be announced. The 17 members of the Kuomintang Committee have not yet been fully decided. After the State Council Committee is reorganized, the Executive Yuan will immediately follow. The candidates who have already been decided are Sun Ke concurrently as the Chairman of the Executive Yuan, Zhang Qun as the President of the Executive Yuan, Weng Wenhao as the Vice President, Gan Naiguang as the Secretary-General, and Pu Xuefeng as the Deputy Secretary-General.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 28th Dispatch] The Constitutional Implementation Promotion Association will hold its first standing committee meeting in Nanjing on the 29th. Members of the Democratic Socialist Party and the Youth Party will arrive in Nanjing on the 29th to attend. At the first meeting, Chairman Sun Ke will only report on the progress of the Legislative Yuan's review of the ten regulations and discuss the draft regulations on matters stipulated in the preparatory procedures for the implementation of the constitution.

[Our Newspaper] The Democratic Socialist Party held a central standing committee meeting at Fan Garden at 3:00 PM yesterday to discuss the list of members of the State Council Committee. There were different opinions at the meeting. As a result, it was decided to postpone the submission and to send Xu Chuanlin, Jiang Yuntian, and other members of the Constitutional Implementation Promotion Association to Nanjing by car yesterday to meet with the central government and discuss everything in person while attending the meeting of the Constitutional Implementation Promotion Association. Li Daming and Hu Haimen are scheduled to go to Nanjing today. Secretary-General Lei Zhen visited Zhang Junmai after the Democratic Socialist Party meeting yesterday to urge him to submit the list of State Council Committee members first. He also visited the Democratic Socialist Party office in the evening to visit the standing committee members, indicating that he was willing to convey all opinions, but hoped that the list of State Council Committee members could be submitted first. Lei Zhen was originally scheduled to return to Nanjing last night, so he postponed it.

[Our Newspaper] Hu Haimen, a representative of the Democratic Socialist Party in the north, arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning and told reporters that Liang Qiushui had asked him to represent him and brought a "verbal message," the content of which he did not want to disclose. When asked whether the Northern Party members opposed participating in the State Council and the Executive Yuan, he did not reveal this, saying that the local party departments did not make any claims on this major plan. A reporter asked whether he could accept Liang Qiushui's appointment as a member of the State Council. He replied: It can be discussed. Liang Qiushui can come to Shanghai if necessary. It is rumored that Hu's visit to the south this time brought the opinions of the Northern Democratic League. Hu strongly denied this, saying that he had met Zhang Dongsun twice in the north, but it was a long time ago, and he had not seen him recently. What is rumored outside has no basis at all.

[Central News Agency, this city] The Youth Party held a central standing committee meeting yesterday morning. The list of State Council Committee members has not yet been decided. It is reported that the chairman of the party, Zeng Qi, will come to Shanghai in the next few days to hold a meeting to discuss the issue of participating in the government.

### Second National Assembly Election

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 28th Dispatch] Hong Lanyou said: The matters of the second National Assembly election will be launched immediately after the promulgation of the National Assembly Election Law. The issue of the National Assembly Hall is being planned internally.

### Soviet Troops in Dalian are Gradually Withdrawing

However, the Communist troops in the area are increasing again

[Our Newspaper, Peiping, 28th Dispatch] Receiving Dalian said: The Soviet troops are gradually withdrawing, but if the National Army enters Dalian, the Communist troops in the area will not hesitate to fight with their backs to the city. Xue Sui's visit to the north is still uncertain.

[Our Newspaper] London, 28th Broadcast; The Soviet government has notified China that it is preparing to return Dalian. It is believed that the Soviet Union sent the same note to China shortly after its note to the United States on February 27. It is reported that preparations for the transfer of Dalian have been completed, but technical details still need to be negotiated with the Soviet Union. Well-informed sources believe that the transfer procedure may be delayed by a month.

[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 28th Dispatch] Chief of Staff Zhao of the Commander-in-Chief's Office will fly to Nanjing in the next few days to report on the military situation in the Northeast and ask for instructions.

[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 28th Dispatch] It is rumored that regarding the reception of Dalian, in addition to the Soviet Union's high asking price for the China Changchun Railway, another major problem is how its troops will withdraw from the Lushun-Dalian-Jinzhou area. If the Communist troops do not withdraw in advance, there will be a bloody battle in the future, which is worrying.

[Our Newspaper, Shenyang, 28th Dispatch] The Communist troops in the Dalian area have now added a special division, with a total of 45,000 troops including the original forces.

### Executive Yuan Allocates US$130,000 to Aid Overseas Chinese in the Dutch East Indies; Vietnamese Troops Evacuate Nam Dinh, Protecting Overseas Chinese

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 28th Dispatch] Following the outbreak of war in the former Dutch East Indies, the lives and properties of tens of thousands of overseas Chinese were at stake. About 2,200 refugees who fled from Bandung, Surabaya, Padang, Sumatra, and Aceh to Gedang Island in Malaya lacked food and clothing and urgently needed relief and repatriation to their original places of residence. Furthermore, according to reports submitted by the consulates in Kuala Lumpur, Penang, and other places, the total number of registered refugees reached 16,011. The Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, in conjunction with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the General Relief Administration, submitted a request to the Executive Yuan for the allocation of special funds for relief. It has now been approved to issue US$130,000, and it is planned to send senior officials to various overseas Chinese areas to instruct on relief measures.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 28th Dispatch] Diplomatic circles report: When the Vietnamese troops evacuated Nam Dinh in northern Vietnam on the 13th of this month, they implemented a scorched-earth policy, but did not destroy the shops and residences of our overseas Chinese. When the French troops occupied the city, Yuan Zijian, our Consul-General in Hanoi, sent personnel to accompany the French Commissioner to Nam Dinh, carrying funds to comfort and provide relief. The overseas Chinese were extremely grateful for the government's enthusiasm in protecting overseas Chinese.

### Civil Aviation Administration Convenes Meeting to Specifically Discuss Aviation Safety

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 28th Dispatch] In order to enhance aviation safety, improve aviation facilities, and explore aviation technology, the Civil Aviation Administration convened relevant agencies such as the Air Transport Brigade of the Air Force Headquarters, the Navy Headquarters, the China and Central Aviation Companies, and the Executive Yuan Air Transport Team to hold a meeting for discussion.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 28th Dispatch] Gu Saiheng, the former puppet Food Minister, and Zhou Naiwen, the vice minister, were sentenced to life imprisonment by the Capital High Court at 2:00 PM on the 28th.

### Legislative Yuan to Continue Discussion on Law of Election and Recall of Legislators Today

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 28th Dispatch] The draft Law of Election and Recall of Legislators was submitted at the Legislative Yuan's regular meeting on the afternoon of the 28th. The legislators spoke enthusiastically on the issue of the number of seats and electoral districts, and the entire Yuan was filled with dissatisfaction. The meeting will continue on the 29th for the Huanghuagang Memorial, with the aim of completing all work before the 31st.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 28th Dispatch] At the Legislative Yuan meeting on the 28th, the draft Law of Election and Recall of Legislators has begun to be discussed. Members Jian Guansan, Peng Chunshi, and others believed that the population statistics were inaccurate. It was decided to wait for the representative of the Ministry of Interior to attend the meeting on the morning of the 29th to explain before further discussion.

### Law of Election and Recall of the President and Vice President Passed

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 28th Dispatch] The draft Law of Election and Recall of the President and Vice President was also completed by the Legislative Yuan's regular meeting on the afternoon of the 28th. The full text of the law has only fourteen articles, which is much simpler than the draft Law of Election and Recall of the National Assembly. After the bill was submitted, Liu Kedu, Chairman of the Constitutional Law Committee, explained it first, and then it was discussed article by article. Zhong Tianxin believed that the provision in the fourth article that a presidential candidate must be jointly signed by 50 National Assembly delegates to be nominated was too few, and that dozens of candidates would be generated in the future. He advocated increasing the number to 150. Zhang Zhaoyuan believed that the reason why 50 people were stipulated at the time was to give small parties the opportunity to nominate presidential candidates, because small parties do not have many National Assembly delegates. If the number of co-signers is too large, small parties will have no possibility of nominating presidential candidates. Jian Guansan proposed a compromise, changing 50 people to 150 people. The resolution was amended and passed. When discussing the election method, Wang Changxiang advocated changing to a vote, but other committee members believed that the handwriting of the vote was easy to recognize, and it was easy to write incorrectly. It was resolved to maintain the original plan. Article 9 stipulates that a statement of recall of the President must be signed and sealed by one-quarter of the total number of National Assembly delegates before it can be submitted. Li Qingxun and others believed that one-quarter would reach 750 people, which was too restrictive and would be difficult to submit in the future. It was advocated to change it to one-sixth, which was passed by a vote. The entire bill was formally passed at 5:15 PM.

### The Third Plenary Session Examines and Approves the Full Text of the Economic Reform Plan (Continued from the 27th)

(5) The Absolute Majority of the Population is Engaged in Agriculture. Agriculture is the backbone of China's economy. Only with developed agriculture, prosperous rural areas, and farmers possessing purchasing power can industry have a foundation and society be stable. Therefore, developing agriculture and promoting rural prosperity are the main objectives of future economic policies. The measures include: 1. Reforming the allocation of agricultural land to ensure its full improvement and utilization. Land tenancy relations should be thoroughly implemented according to the principle of "25% Rent Reduction," and efforts should be made to realize "Land to the Tiller" as much as possible, so that farmers can fully engage in production. 2. Establishing collective farms, utilizing new-style machinery and methods to increase production as a demonstration for farmers, and expanding agricultural experiment and research stations to enhance production technology. 3. In agricultural reform, water conservancy is paramount. The construction of large-scale water conservancy projects and main canals should be actively undertaken by the state. The construction of small-scale water conservancy projects and branch canals should be supervised by the central government and handled by the provinces and counties. The issuance of water conservancy bonds should be permitted. Local governments should be responsible for the maintenance of completed projects. 4. Expanding the organization of cooperatives and mutual aid societies to genuinely facilitate agricultural loans and alleviate the pressure of high-interest loans on farmers. 5. Actively and universally establishing a warehousing system to protect the interests of people's production. 6. Widely establishing nurseries, promoting afforestation, and ensuring their growth through effective measures. 7. Utilizing slack farming seasons to train farmers in civil engineering, stonework, and other technologies, and developing rural side occupations to improve farmers' lives. 8. Developing animal husbandry and providing assistance and protection. 9. Encouraging fisheries and protecting their development.

(6) Industry Must Be Self-Sufficient for People's Livelihood. Civil Industry serves as a protection for agriculture, ensuring mutual support and benefit between agriculture and industry. Only then can the foundation of China's economy be established. Therefore, the current development of industry should prioritize civil industries. The government must urgently improve the industrial environment, protect industrial profits, and provide the greatest convenience for industrial loans. At the same time, a comprehensive construction plan should be formulated, defining the scope of state-owned, locally-owned, and privately-owned enterprises, categorized, regionally divided, and clearly stipulated. Implementation should be supervised, and annual production targets should be predetermined, with the government and the people jointly establishing them in phases. The measures include: 1. In the first phase of developing the machinery and chemical industries, efforts should be made to meet the needs of agriculture and forestry, and to solve problems such as water conservancy projects, chemical fertilizers, agricultural tools, granaries, and transportation equipment. 2. Industrial construction should be distributed as much as possible in inland areas where fuel and raw materials are cheaper. 3. If industrial development starts with equipment engineering, some parts should be purchased from abroad, gradually developing into industries capable of manufacturing everything. 4. Except for railways, large-scale hydroelectric power generation, steel plants, and mining industries, which are stipulated to be state-owned or locally-owned, other industries should be encouraged as much as possible to be operated by private individuals in a cooperative manner. 5. Encouraging certain manufacturing enterprises to simultaneously focus on industrial experiments and geological surveys to achieve progress and new inventions. 6. Paying special attention to utilizing slack farming seasons to develop rural handicrafts to meet the needs of both urban and international markets. 7. Developing various mineral resources to meet the needs of industrial development and export goods. 8. The government should gather public and private banks to organize a reconstruction financial company, investing long-term funds in industrial and mining construction projects, and utilize overseas Chinese funds and foreign exchange assets deposited abroad to invest in the company to purchase machinery and raw materials from abroad. 9. Banks should ensure that loans for industrial and mining enterprises are used for production, and accept fixed assets such as factory buildings and machinery as collateral, without limiting the loan standard to half the value of raw materials and finished products. Unreasonable methods such as pre-deducting interest and arbitrarily charging handling fees to increase the burden of industrial costs should not be allowed. 10. Equipment from factories dismantled in Japan, except for those that must be state-owned, should be handled by various industries responsible for dismantling, transporting, installing, and starting operations. Existing enemy and puppet industrial and mining enterprises that are not easily sold through bidding should be leased to private enterprises. 11. Wages should be reasonable. All provinces and cities should universally implement a wage evaluation system to stabilize production order, with labor and management working together to increase production.

(7) Commerce. A huge excess of imports over exports is a major disease of the national economy. The government should encourage exports through effective methods to gradually balance foreign trade. The measures include: 1. Domestic trade should make full use of the adjustment of financial institutions and the convenience of land, sea, and air transportation to encourage commodity circulation, increase the total volume of national trade, and promote balanced development. 2. In international trade, imports should be strictly limited, except for production tools, raw materials, books, and instruments, to save unnecessary foreign exchange expenditure. Trade and financial institutions should be utilized as much as possible to encourage and assist private enterprises. Foreign exchange deposits of Chinese citizens abroad should be implemented quickly in accordance with the emergency economic measures plan. 3. Export businesses should be actively encouraged. The foreign exchange earned can be used with import and export license linkage methods to develop import and export businesses. Consideration should be given to improving and expanding various special products to standardize them for major export goods. Rural handicrafts should also be organized and improved in a cooperative manner and centrally exported to balance the trade surplus. 4. The National Federation of Cooperatives should be responsible for contacting the International Cooperative Trading Committee of the International Cooperative Alliance and wholesale cooperatives in various countries and trying the barter system. (To be continued)

### Draft Law on the Election and Recall of National Assembly Delegates Amended and Passed by the Legislative Yuan; Number of Delegates from Border Regions and Overseas Chinese Increased

[Our Correspondent, Nanjing, 28th] The draft law on the election and recall of delegates to the National Assembly, which has drawn attention from all parties, has completed the legislative process after two days of discussion by the Legislative Yuan. After its formal promulgation by the National Government on April 1st, constitutional enthusiasts throughout the country can begin preparations for the elections. The Legislative Yuan meeting on the 28th was still presided over by President Sun, with Overseas Chinese Affairs Commissioner Chen Shuren also attending to explain. The most intense dispute during the meeting was still the issue of delegate quota allocation. Commissioners Chen Anren, Wang Quansheng, and others requested an increase in the quota for overseas Chinese delegates, while Guang Lu, Wu Yunpeng, and others actively spoke in support of seats for Mongolia and Tibet. Zhong Tianxin believed that the request for increased quotas from border region delegates was a good phenomenon and should be supported, which was overwhelmingly approved by the entire Yuan. As a result, the number of Tibetan delegates was increased from 30 to 40, those elected by various ethnic groups in border areas increased from 10 to 17, and the number of overseas Chinese delegates increased from 57 to 65. During the discussion of the qualifications of electors and candidates, some legislators believed that clauses such as those who had committed crimes of internal rebellion and external aggression under the Criminal Law and those who had been convicted of corruption while serving in public office should be deleted. The debate was particularly fierce, but the original proposal was ultimately maintained. Regarding the limitation on the number of candidates nominated, Liu Kebei believed that requiring the signatures of 100 electors for nomination was too few. Jian Guansan proposed replacing the originally planned supervisory committee system with a chairman elected by everyone. Wang Shizeng cited three reasons to explain why the new method was better than the original proposal: (1) The committee system cannot coexist with the supervisory system, (2) If the Ministry of Interior or the people preside, everything will be entrusted to staff, which is too hasty, (3) All parties should have the opportunity to participate in the constitutional process. A vote was taken on adopting the committee system. When discussing Article 28, Lv Fu believed that it was easy to have opportunistic situations when candidates are elected in order based on the number of votes, based on the legal number of elected quotas. He argued that the method used in France should be emulated, where a second election is held when a majority cannot be obtained. Di Ying and Liu Kejun both believed that this matter was difficult to handle, and it was decided to maintain the original proposal. The discussion on the issue of recall was the most intense, with fierce debate over the number of people required to initiate a recall and the number of times a recall could be initiated. It was decided to delete the statement "If a recall motion is rejected, no further recall may be made against the same delegate during the original term of office." The entire case was discussed at half past four in the afternoon and formally passed while everyone stood at attention. (Full text on page eight of tomorrow's edition)

### National Army in Shandong Province Advances with the Force of a Bamboo Split: Feicheng, Feixian, and Dakow Recovered One After Another; Battle Situation in Central Shandong Enters a Decisive Phase

[Our Correspondent, Xuzhou, 28th] The National Army in western Shandong entered Feicheng at 11:00 AM on the 27th and is continuing to clear out remnants towards the northeast of the city today. The National Army in southern Shandong, with the labor of broken bamboos, recovered Feixian at 4:00 PM on the 27th. The remaining communist troops collapsed and retreated like scattered crows. Yang Junya, the magistrate of Feixian County, entered the city with the army to appease the refugees. The National Army on the Jinpu front entered Dakow on the afternoon of the 27th. The remnants of Liu Bocheng's communist troops on the north bank of the Yellow River in western Shandong, consisting of the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 6th, and 7th columns, totaling more than 40,000 men, are still in the Xinxian, Shouchang, and Fanxian areas, undergoing reorganization. It is rumored that Liu Bocheng's headquarters has moved to Weixian.

[Another dispatch] Approximately 50,000 remnants of Chen Yi's communist troops in the Mengyin and Xintai areas of the Yimeng Mountains have recently been actively destroying roads, digging caves, transporting supplies, and coercing the people to go up the mountains to fortify and clear the fields, attempting to avoid a decisive battle with the main force. Furthermore, on the 26th, a communist cavalry independent regiment of more than 400 cavalry was ambushed by a surprise attack by the National Army at Qingshanpu, 20 li northeast of Yishui. The communist troops suffered more than 250 casualties, including two battalion commanders.

[Our Correspondent, Jinan, 28th] The troops under General Wang Yanwu have victoriously joined forces with the Wang Jingjiu corps, which is advancing north on the left side of the Jinpu Railway. One unit moved westward from Changqing, overcoming the strong resistance of the communist troops, and joined forces with the National Army moving north from Pingyin near Xiaolipu on the evening of the 27th. Another unit moved south from Changqing and formally recovered and joined forces with the National Army moving north at Feicheng at 9:00 AM on the 28th. They are currently mopping up the remaining communist troops retreating from the Changping-Fei triangle area. In order to contain the victorious convergence of the National Army and reverse the declining trend, the communist troops in central Shandong transferred the Jie 5th Division, 6th Division, and Hui Police 4th Brigade, originally stationed on the periphery of Juxian County, to the east of Pingdu.

It is expected that Chen Yi's final fate will be announced within ten days. At the same time, traffic between Pukou and Jinan on the Jinpu Railway will also be restored.

[Our Correspondent, Beiping, 28th] After recapturing Yanchang for the second time on the 25th, the Northern Shaanxi National Army joined forces with the National Army coming from the east and directly attacked Yanchuan. The rapid-response unit of the 28th Army has already approached the suburbs of the city. Another unit of the National Army successfully launched a surprise attack on Yongpingzhen from Tianmen North, echoing the troops moving north from Yanchang. They have surrounded Yanchuan on three sides. The communist troops in the city consist of only one battalion, and it can be recovered soon. The National Army moving north after capturing Panlong continued to capture Dazhai on the morning of the 27th, and the communist "alternate capital" of Wa Yao Fort is now within range of heavy artillery.

[Our Correspondent, Xi'an, 28th] A telegraph line has been connected between Luochuan and Yanan, but communication is difficult. A batch of radio equipment, rather than telephone lines, arrived in Yan yesterday and is being installed quickly. A small plane landed safely at Yanan Airport for the first time yesterday, carrying airport equipment. Large planes will still be able to take off and land in three to several days.

### Meeting of the Standing Committee of the People's Political Council; Chief of Staff Chen Reports on Military Affairs; Army Reorganization and Construction Continue Actively

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 28th] The Standing Committee of the People's Political Council held its 19th meeting at 9:00 AM on the 28th, chaired by Jiang Yong. Chief of Staff Chen Cheng reported on the recent military situation. Chen gave a concise explanation of the demobilization, reorganization, construction, and recent military developments of the army over the past year. According to him, the government's administrative policy this year will continue to actively implement the plans for demobilization, reorganization, and construction of the army. In terms of army reorganization, 89 divisions have been reorganized, eliminating a total of 5 corps, 15 divisions, and 180 regiments. The number of personnel serving in military organs, originally more than 730,000, has been reduced to 300,000. If the national army can continue to be reorganized, the number of personnel in military organs can be further reduced. As for the demobilized officers and soldiers, efforts will be made to properly resettle them and engage in production work. Those who wish to retire will be provided with resettlement funds. In terms of army construction, the main tasks are to improve the quality of the army, adjust the military structure, establish a supply system, and establish a naval, land, and air force education system. Other aspects, such as the adjustment of the conscription system, the establishment of military industry, and the construction of barracks and fortresses, are also being implemented step by step. Regarding military affairs, due to the communist troops' deliberate disturbances, the National Army had no choice but to make necessary counterattacks. Yanan in northern Shaanxi has been recovered, and the remnants of the communist troops are fleeing in disarray. More than 10,000 communist troops surrendered in this campaign. It has been discovered that the communist troops in the Northeast have a Korean-Chinese mixed division, which is clear proof of the communist collusion with foreign powers and their lack of military capability. In Shandong, the National Army is actively clearing the Jinpu Railway. In total, over the past year, 130,000 communist troops have surrendered, more than 74,000 have been captured, and a large number of light and heavy weapons have been seized. More than 240 county towns have been recovered by the National Army. After Chen's report, Councilors Xue Mingjian, Yin Shuxian, Su Ting, Luo Heng, Xiang Kuiyi, Qian Gonglai, and Xu Xiaoyan raised questions, which Chief of Staff Chen answered one by one. The main points are as follows: (1) Military discipline will be strictly enforced.

(5) In the future, all training institutions related to military affairs will be unified. (6) Domestic arms production has long been given attention for improvement. (7) Enemy and puppet materials that can be used for military purposes will be negotiated with relevant agencies for allocation.

(4) The proposal by Luo Heng and others requesting the government to order the transportation authorities to continue to repair the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway and complete it within a limited time to facilitate communication with Vietnam and comfort the people was passed and sent to the government for prompt action and completion within a limited time. (5) The proposal by Luo Heng and others requesting the government to order the Nanjing Municipal Government to quickly set up more tap water stations in small streets and residential areas of ordinary people in various districts of the city to ease the water use of ordinary people, reduce diseases, and protect the health of the people was passed and sent to the government for prompt action.

### General Association of Social Welfare Meeting Concludes Successfully Yesterday Afternoon; Madam Chiang Kai-shek Attends and Delivers Encouraging Remarks

[Our Report] The General Association of Social Welfare Work Conference, which had been held for five consecutive days, concluded successfully at 5:00 PM yesterday. Madam Chiang Kai-shek, Soong Mei-ling, specially attended and delivered a speech yesterday morning accompanied by Dr. Wu Yi-fang. Yesterday's meeting discussed the connection between social welfare organizations in the morning and social welfare administration in the afternoon, passing several motions respectively. The details are recorded below:

Madam Chiang's Speech: Madam Chiang stated in her speech that social welfare workers in China, if they wish to complete their tasks, should focus on the following points: (1) Moral courage and an upright purpose; (2) Imagination and understanding; (3) Imaginative moral courage. These are essential. However, we must clearly recognize that in Chinese history or in world history, there has never been such large-scale international cooperation. Therefore, it is very difficult to fully meet the expectations of the people. We have been on the road for nine hours, have arrived safely, and appear very tired. However, we have an upright purpose. If we feel that we have made the greatest effort under difficult circumstances, then we can be free from guilt, no matter how the people criticize. External accusations are very easy to incur, because the general public does not understand the difficulties we face.

She also said: I mentioned before that those engaged in social welfare work must have imagination, meaning that we should think for the people and consider how to inform them of our assistance measures. We must have this imagination in order to have great sympathy and understanding for those suffering masses. Finally, I mentioned that in order to complete our task, we must have imagination. Sometimes we are troubled by many obstacles and difficulties, and feel worried and disappointed. But if we pay attention to the long-term goal and make imagination a reality, then all obstacles will become stepping stones to success.

Madam Chiang Kai-shek also cited the example of the fall of the Roman Empire, saying, "Deception and speculation" can often destroy great undertakings. Madam Chiang pointed out: "The huge task before us is how to deal with the social situation so that China can make a positive contribution to the world community."

Motions Passed in the Morning

The motions passed in the morning were: Connection of Welfare Organizations: Provinces without a connection institution should establish one immediately, and those that have already established one should expand it to mobilize the broad social forces. Also, before such liaison committees have actively taken effect, the Executive Yuan Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CRRRA) and the Ministry of Social Affairs should utilize the experience and assistance of social organizations.

Transfer of Welfare Responsibilities to Permanent Institutions: (1) The implementation of the existing welfare programs of the CRRRA at the central level and the distribution of related materials should be transferred to the responsibility of the Ministry of Social Affairs.

(3) Before the end of CRRRA's work, the CRRRA and the General Association should, in consultation with the social affairs bureaus and social organizations of provinces and counties, transfer welfare responsibilities to appropriate institutions.

Sources of Funding for Social Organizations: Each region should launch joint fundraising campaigns, and the government is requested to do its best to encourage local fundraising.

(3) Various welfare materials and equipment (including office and transportation equipment), as well as a portion of the welfare program, and other materials should be transferred to the Ministry of Social Affairs and the social affairs bureaus of each province and city. (4) The Ministry of Social Affairs and social affairs bureaus should do their best to assist private organizations that cooperate with the CRRRA in promoting welfare programs.

Guidance and Training: Recommendation: (1) The Ministry of Social Affairs should select experienced personnel as soon as possible to promote the on-site guidance system that has already begun in cooperation with foreign experts.

### The Responsibility of Revolutionary Youth Todayâ€”Commemorating the Huanghuagang Martyrs on Youth Day

Today is the anniversary of the righteous martyrdom of the 72 martyrs of Huanghuagang, and also Youth Day. In past years, grand commemorative meetings were held in various places, expressing sincere respect and mourning for the martyrdom of the revolutionary martyrs, and giving great and far-reaching encouragement to the efforts and struggles of today's youth. Especially this year, when the country is advancing on the road to constitutional construction after the victory of the War of Resistance, our remembrance of the glorious sacrifice of the martyrs can reassure them of our victory in resisting the brutal Japanese, but also greatly increases our vigilance in the face of the current domestic and international situation; thus, the arrival of this year's Youth Day is of particularly profound significance.

Recalling this day thirty-six years ago, when the corrupt Qing government was wreaking havoc, the people of the country were suffering and groaning under the tyrannical rule of foreign races, although before that righteous men had risen up in various places as many as nine times, unfortunately all were defeated, and the world was in panic. In this time of crisis, relying on the indomitable spirit of the martyrs and their determination to sacrifice themselves for righteousness, under the great leadership of Premier Sun, on March 29th of the Xinhai year, the righteous act of attacking the Liangguang Governor's Office in Guangzhou was launched. With heroic and overwhelming spirit, they fought a bloody battle with Qing officials, resulting in the heroic sacrifice of seventy-one martyrs including Lin Juemin. Although this battle failed to realize the hope of overthrowing the Qing Dynasty, the heroic sacrifice of the seventy-two martyrs was great: fresh red blood bloomed into flowers of freedom, and the seeds of revolution were sown in the vast ranks of the people, thus creating the foundation for the success of the Double Tenth Revolution. The Kuomintang's thirty years of struggle, launching the Northern Expedition, completing unification, resisting aggression, and carrying out the War of Resistance, finally defeating the Japanese invaders, all relied on this revolutionary vitality. Therefore, today's memorial to the revolutionary martyrs must absorb. The reason why the spirit of the martyrs inspires the nation and lasts forever without waning is that these seventy-two young heroes possessed a revolutionary spirit, revolutionary wisdom, and a revolutionary goal of liberating the people and striving for independence, which is a model. The success of the Xinhai Double Tenth Revolution, and the success of the Northern Expedition and the War of Resistance that followed, were also continuations of this revolutionary spirit and revolutionary wisdom. Therefore, today's Kuomintang members, striving for national construction and struggling for the future of the new China, should possess the spirit of the martyrs, become more new with the times, continue to nourish the vitality of revolutionary creation, continue to promote the glory of the party, and shoulder the major responsibility of national construction. Therefore, today's commemoration of the revolutionary martyrs should not only be a formal commemoration, but also a spiritual pursuit, carrying forward the revolutionary spirit and wisdom of the martyrs.

The setting of Youth Day on this day is indeed of great significance. First, because the heroic sacrifice of the seventy-two young heroes on March 29th of the Xinhai year was a great movement initiated by Chinese youth for national revolution and freedom, their spirit is worthy of emulation, and their wisdom is worthy of learning. Therefore, the meaning of taking "March 29th" as Youth Day is indeed profound. Secondly, the International Youth Conference held in London in November 1942, in order to promote world peace and world youth unity, selected March 21st to 28th as International Youth Week. China is a participating country in the International Youth Conference, and Chinese youth are members of the International Youth, so the Chinese Youth Day is set on March 29th, following closely the development of International Youth Week, and also has world significance. This year's International Youth Week is the "Peace Week" for youths of all countries in the world. Before today, youths of all countries are working for world peace, fighting against the elimination of aggressive thoughts, and working for the happiness of mankind. Chinese youth are not isolated, so in today's commemoration of Youth Day, Chinese youth should recognize the times, cooperate with the actions of international youth, strive for world peace, and oppose the re-harming of world peace by aggressive thoughts. At the same time, for the sake of peace at home, it is necessary to justly denounce those who rely on force and deliberately rebel. This is the era task and the task to the world that revolutionary youth bear.

The history of the Republic of China for thirty-six years is a history full of sorrow. Before the Xinhai Double Tenth Revolution, Chinese youth repeatedly raised the flag of righteousness and shed blood again and again. After the founding of the Republic of China, through the Second Revolution, the anti-Yuan Shikai campaign, the guardianship campaign, and the Northern Expedition launched in the fifteenth year, the country was finally unified in the seventeenth year. As soon as the country was stable, internal and external troubles intensified again. In the twenty-sixth year, the whole country rose up to resist the war, and the Japanese bandits surrendered in the thirty-fourth year. After the victory, the government was preparing for post-war construction, hoping to fulfill the unfinished ambitions of the seventy-two martyrs. Unfortunately, the Communist Party destroyed unity again, so wars continued, people's lives were devastated, and the country had no peaceful days. Today, we respectfully mourn the anniversary of the martyrdom of the seventy-two martyrs and welcome the great Youth Day. Looking at the present and thinking about the past, we deeply feel an infinitely heavy heart; planning for the future and encouraging the past, we deeply feel an infinitely important responsibility. The current country needs the success of peaceful reunification, the implementation of democratic law, the guarantee of people's livelihoods, and the stability of social order. Therefore, today and after today, in order for our youth to shoulder the great task of national construction and salvation, everyone must restore the state of mind and spirit of the revolutionary party members of thirty-six years ago, rise up to maintain the unity of the country, work hard on various constructions, and create a new China of the Three People's Principles. Only in this way can the Republic of China have a bright and splendid future, and the achievements of the revolution can be preserved for a long time, and the seventy-two martyrs of Huanghuagang will truly be immortal. Only in this way can Chinese youth fulfill their era's responsibility. The cause entrusted to us by the seventy-two young heroes will truly be successful. May our youth encourage each other!

### The Political Atmosphere in Moscow is Gloomy; The Foreign Ministers' Conference Encounters Difficulties; Marshall Denies He Will Return Home Early

[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 28th] The end of this week is of a decisive nature for the Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference. All parties are looking forward to the final session. The two major difficulties at present are (1) the issue of German assets in Austria, and (2) the issue of German economic unification. Discussions on the former issue reached a stalemate yesterday and will resume today. Unless a solution can be found today, the drafting of the Austrian peace treaty will be delayed. As for the German peace treaty, after working all night, the Adjustment Committee has almost completed its report, so the Foreign Ministers' Conference can at least touch on the German issue. Although the Foreign Ministers have been discussing for half a month, there is still no sign of a solution. This discussion only allows for a comparison of various opinions. As a result, opinions on economic unification differ greatly. Whether the imminent crisis of the conference can be avoided remains to be seen.

[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 27th] Observers recently compared the pedestrians on the streets of Moscow with the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference, saying that the snow on the streets of Moscow has begun to melt, but there is still no news of spring in the political atmosphere.

[Our Report] Moscow Radio, 28th: During the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference, the Soviet side has begun a "bargaining" compromise movement, the purpose of which is to attempt to obtain compensation from the current German production, but Britain and the United States still firmly adhere to their original position.

[Another Dispatch] The Adjustment Committee finally completed its work of analyzing the points of "agreement" and "disagreement" of the Foreign Ministers at this conference at 10:00 AM this morning (Greenwich time). According to the final draft of the Committee, as of now, the Foreign Ministers have not reached an agreement on every important issue concerning Germany's economy and politics.

[Central News Agency, Moscow, 27th, United Press] Marshall's press liaison secretary recently denied the British Broadcasting Corporation's report that Marshall was scheduled to leave the Soviet Union on April 6. According to the British Broadcasting Corporation, Marshall told Bevin that he was scheduled to leave the Soviet Union on April 6, but Marshall's secretary denied this. He said that the French delegation is scheduled to hold a reception on April 7, the British delegation is scheduled to hold a reception on the 9th, and the US delegation will hold a reception after the British delegation. It is speculated that the Foreign Ministers' Conference may close in early April.

### The Four Powers Have Major Disputes Over the Disposal of German Assets in Austria; Instructions to the Deputy Foreign Ministers to Establish a Definition

[Our Report] Moscow Radio, 28th: Molotov proposed an amendment to the definition of German assets in Austria at yesterday's Foreign Ministers' Conference. According to reliable sources, Marshall expressed great dissatisfaction with this and decided to reject it.

[Reuters, Moscow, 27th] The Soviet Union still demanded the freedom to determine the definition of German funds in Australia at today's Foreign Ministers' Conference. Britain, the United States, and France demanded that the four powers establish the definition of these funds and set up appropriate arbitration institutions to implement arbitration in the event of disputes. Pidu also proposed a three-point resolution, but Molotov immediately proposed an amendment to the resolution. The Foreign Ministers' Conference will continue to discuss the issue of German funds in Austria tomorrow. The Foreign Ministers' Conference also resolved today to reject Yugoslavia's request to present oral opinions to the Foreign Ministers on the report of the Trieste Finance Committee, but allowed Italy and Yugoslavia to submit written opinions. In addition, the Soviet Union also submitted a memorandum announcing its decision to completely destroy all German warships listed in Category "C" in the Three Powers' Agreement on the Distribution of German Navy before August 1947.

The definition of German funds in Austria is the most thorny issue. Today's debate fully exposed the differences in viewpoints between the Soviet Union and the other three countries. Molotov stated that since the British and American governments have announced their abandonment of the right to claim German property in the Soviet zone of Austria, the Soviet authorities have the right to dispose of such property freely. Molotov also believed that the suggestion of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France to stipulate specific definitions by the four powers and to implement arbitration in the event of disputes was unnecessary. He believed that only one more clause needed to be added to the treaty guaranteeing the control of such property. Marshall emphasized that the purpose of the Allies was to establish an independent Austria, so that it had appropriate property to maintain its survival. Bevin also said that the Potsdam Conference never decided that property stolen by Germany could also be used as reparations. The proposal put forward by Pidu advocated instructing the representatives of the Foreign Ministers (1) to draft the provisions for the distribution of German property in Austria based on the Potsdam resolution, and to include them in the Austrian Peace Treaty; (2) to establish the definition of German property in Austria, and the property of Wu nationals or United Nations nationals that was forcibly seized by Germany for racial, religious or political reasons should not be included; (3) to draft arbitration clauses based on Article 50 of the Austrian Peace Treaty to resolve disputes. Jiang Luotofu expressed his willingness to accept the first clause, but could not accept the third clause, and proposed to amend the second clause as follows: "The representatives of the Foreign Ministers should establish the definition of German funds in Austria, and the property seized by the Germans by direct violent action, or the property that was conquered without paying compensation to Austrian or United Nations nationals, should not be included." The Four Foreign Ministers' Conference then adjourned to review Molotov's amendments.

### Lai Yi Goes to Norway, Hu Shize Temporarily Assumes Duties [United Press, Chenggong Lake, 27th] United Nations Secretary-General Lai Yi flew to Norway today to report to the national parliament.

Bevin Resigns from a Concurrent Post, Public Believes British Cabinet Will Be Reorganized Sooner or Later, Government Appoints Key Officials to Implement Economic Plan [Agence France-Presse, London, 28th] It was announced here recently that British Foreign Secretary Bevin has resigned from his concurrent post as Chairman of the Cabinet Manpower Committee. This has no political significance and is purely due to the excessive workload of the Foreign Secretary.

[United Press, London, 27th] People close to Prime Minister Attlee said today that they believe the cabinet may be reorganized "sooner," but they do not attach importance to the rumor that Bevin will resign as Foreign Secretary. At the same time, Labour MPs who oppose the current government's foreign policy insist that the Prime Minister should transfer Bevin to another position to prevent the party's internal division from expanding. These MPs launched opposition to Bevin's policies last autumn. It is said that the government denies any changes to Bevin's position because it does not want to weaken his position in the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference, but because British foreign policy endangers the survival of socialism, Bevin will inevitably be dismissed sooner or later.

Marshall's Meeting Still Not Confirmed [This Newspaper News] London, 28th broadcast: Marshall has been in Moscow for three weeks and has not yet proposed a meeting with Stalin.

Most of Marshall's advisors are against him meeting with Stalin, and some people believe that Bevin's request to meet with Stalin was a mistake. It is reported that during the Bevin-Stalin meeting, Stalin suggested providing economic assistance from the Soviet Union to Britain to alleviate the current crisis.

At around 9:30 pm, the owner, Wu Longyuan (38 years old, from Anhui), was using a scale to check whether the weight was sufficient when the gasoline overflowed and touched the stove fire, causing a sudden fire that could not be controlled.

The charred bodies were found in the rubble, their faces unrecognizable, looking like black charcoal, a tragic scene. The Songshan Road Police Precinct sent Inspector Ha and police officers to investigate the incident. It was learned that the shop had no back door, resulting in the tragedy. The fire starter, Wu Longyuan, is on the run.

Subsidies for Eight Major Public Utilities Approved for March, Nineteen Units to Receive a Total of Over 15 Billion, Shanghai Electric Power Company Declares Waiver [This Newspaper News] Shanghai's eight major public utilities, including water, electricity, gas, telephone, tram, city public buses, ferries, and small railways, have recently suffered significant losses. It has now been decided by the central government that prices will not be increased for the time being, and the shortfall in revenue will be subsidized by the government. The total subsidy for March (totaling 15,170,053,700 yuan) has been approved by the Executive Yuan to be allocated in full.

The subsidized units include four in the electricity sector: French, Chinese, Zhabei, and Pudong. There are five in the water sector: Mainland, Zhabei, British, French, and Pudong. There are two in the gas sector: Shanghai and Wusong. There are two in the tram sector: British and French. There are two in the public bus sector: French and municipal. In addition, there are the Shanghai Telephone Company, the municipal ferry company, and the Shangchuan and Shangnan small railways, totaling 19 units. Among them, French companies receive the most because they include four units: electricity, water, tram, and public buses. The US-owned Shanghai Electric Power Company and Huxi Electric Power Company, however, have expressed their disagreement with the government's subsidy policy and have waived the subsidy for March. It has not yet been decided whether to apply for subsidies in April. Yesterday, the Public Utilities Bureau notified the subsidized companies separately and, to avoid difficulties for the companies in receiving funds, has agreed with President Zhang of the Central Bank to have each company open a special account at the Central Bank. Within the monthly subsidy amount, they can withdraw funds from the Central Bank at any time as needed, even before the state treasury funds arrive, and the Central Bank will advance the funds.

Price Adjustments for Four Types of Businesses, including Ferries, Under Review Yesterday, according to Director Zhao of the Public Utilities Bureau, the subsidized funds from the state treasury are paid by the majority of citizens. Therefore, Minister Wang of the Ministry of Economic Affairs instructed that the scope of subsidies should be limited to those enjoyed by the majority of citizens. As for small-scale public utilities such as ferries, barges, suburban temporary buses, and long-distance buses, as they are enjoyed by fewer people, reasonable adjustments will still be allowed to maintain operations and avoid increasing the burden on the state treasury. It is reported that the prices for the above four types of businesses, including ferries, barges, suburban temporary buses, and long-distance buses, are scheduled to be adjusted starting in early April, and the amount of adjustment is still under review.

Gang of Outlaws Ravaging the Seas Captured [This Newspaper News] Sun Xinmin, the head of the sand bandits (one of the names for pirates) who claimed to be the commander of a guerrilla force during the Anti-Japanese War, and his accomplices Zhao Jinshan, Liu Hanchen, and 13 others, hid in the Chuansha Chongming area of Pudong after the victory, engaging in business as a cover while continuing to commit murder and robbery at sea. A few months ago, the Transportation Police Headquarters, together with the Inspection Department of the Songhu Garrison Headquarters, arrested them at No. 3, Zhongnan New Village, Linsen Road. At the same time, the remaining members of the Sun bandit gang, Zhao Jinshan, Liu Hanchen, Liu Yiting, Kong Xianming, Li Maorong, Li Xuexun, Ding Jiapu, Zhang Fuhai, Meng Zhaogui, Zhu Luosheng, Huang Simao, Yu Jinyang, and Zhu Liang Gou, a total of thirteen people, who were robbing on the sea off Chongming Island, were surrounded and captured by Guo Luzhou, captain of the 18th Transportation Police Brigade, Zhang Weibang, captain of the Shengsi District Fishery Protection Police in Jiangsu Province, and the Pudong Inspection Brigade. One carbine, two Thompson submachine guns, two short guns, and a large amount of stolen goods such as salted pork, tung oil, Western medicine, and tea were seized at the scene. After interrogation, the bandits confessed to the following crimes: (1) On the seventh day of the twelfth lunar month last year, they robbed a Shandong boat carrying salted pork off the coast of Chongming Dongyantou, stealing 220 pieces of salted pork, sinking the boat, and detaining the boat owner and 21 passengers. Then, on the sixteenth of the same month, they followed Sun Bandit's orders to use their own sailboat to transport the detainees to the sea off Chongming Island and threw them into the sea to eliminate traces. (2) On the same day, they also intercepted a Shandong boat, stealing 360 pieces of salted pork, capsizing the boat, and sinking all thirteen crew members. (3) On the seventh day of the first lunar month this year, they intercepted a cotton boat off the coast of Chongming, stealing 40 bales of cotton, tea, matches, tung oil, and Western medicine. However, this time they exceptionally released the people and the boat. They then encountered a Jiangbei boat and stole more than 800 pieces of salted pork, then sank the boat again, throwing all sixteen crew members into the sea. In total, as many as 50 people were thrown into the sea and drowned. The case has been transferred by the Transportation Police Headquarters to the Military Law Office of the Garrison Headquarters for interrogation and reported to Chairman Chiang. It is reported that the Chairman has sent a telegram to Shanghai instructing that the stolen goods should be returned to the owners or their families by the Transportation Police Headquarters and the Songhu Garrison Headquarters. If no one claims them within six months, the stolen goods will be sold, and 30% of the proceeds will be used to reward the personnel involved, and the remainder will be turned over to the national treasury. Tao Yishan, director of the Inspection Department of the Headquarters, Zhang Weibang, captain of the Jiangsu Shengsi District Fishery Protection Police, and the personnel involved in the Transportation Police Headquarters and the 18th Transportation Police Brigade have each been commended.

Dispute Over Deposits at China Finance Bank, 200 Silver Dollars Judged to be Worth 500,000 [This Newspaper News] The Civil Court of the High Court announced yesterday the judgment of an appeal case regarding a bank deposit dispute before the war, ordering a payment of 500 times the original amount, creating the lowest record in deposit disputes.

Managers of Four Companies Interrogated in Case of Collusion and Manipulation of Gold, Procedures for Receiving Allotment Gold, Feng Qingan and Others Claim to Have Nothing to Do with Zhan Liansheng [This Newspaper News] The first "gold rush case" after the victory that shocked the national financial community and affected the entire national economy and people's livelihood was heard in court yesterday afternoon. The court summoned Feng Qingan, manager of Yang Qinghe Faji Silver Shop, Ni Zuguang, manager of Fang Jiuxia Changji Silver Shop, Xie Bingquan, manager of Dakangyuan Gold Shop, and Zhang Baiyuan, manager of Dafengheng Gold Shop, to testify. Zhan Liansheng, manager of Tongfengyu Gold Shop, who was in custody, was not brought in for cross-examination. He Qishen, a consultant from the Ministry of Finance specially sent to Shanghai to reinvestigate the "gold rush case," and auditor Fan Shiyu from the Audit Department were present to observe. The audience seats in the Eighth Criminal Court were full. After Judge Wang Jiazuo called the roll, he questioned them one by one in order. According to Feng Qingan, he has no family or business relations with Lin Fengbao and Yang Anren, the director and deputy director of the Business Bureau of the Central Bank, and Zhan Liansheng. Because Yang Qinghe is an old store with more than 50 years of history and excellent credit, the Central Bank designated it to distribute gold and represent the silver shop industry to receive gold bars from the Central Bank or Tongfengyu Gold Shop, and then distribute them to the industry. When receiving gold, there is no need for Zhan Liansheng to stamp it. The Central Bank sold gold in two ways: open distribution and secret distribution. The price of open distribution was determined daily at 10 am by Lin Fengbao and Yang Anren, but the market conditions were provided by the chairmen of the silver shop and gold shop industries. The purpose of secret distribution was to suppress gold prices, and he only did about 40 bars. The court then asked that on January 24 this year, the Central Bank sold a total of 300 gold bars, including 15 bars under the name of Fang Jiuxia, but there were only 10 bars on Fang Jiuxia's account. Since you received allotment gold on behalf of the silver shop industry, you should know. Feng thought for a moment and replied: I don't remember clearly, please ask Fang Jiuxia. He also said: Because our store's overnight funds are not abundant, the application for allotment gold is also uniquely small. Ni Zuguang said that Fang Jiuxia's funds were 12 million yuan. From April to August last year, Fang Jiuxia represented the silver shop industry in receiving gold from the Central Bank. The representative of the gold shop was Zhan Liansheng of Tongfengyu. Open distribution can be received directly, but secret distribution requires Zhan's stamp before it can be received. At the same time, he also said: If the cash is not counted, it can be temporarily owed, but it cannot be owed until the next day, and it must be cleared in the afternoon. As for the difference on the account on January 24, it was probably recorded on the second day's account. Xie Bingquan said that Dakangyuan Gold Shop's funds were 2.4 million yuan at the time of victory. The Central Bank designated the allotment gold, which has nothing to do with Zhan Liansheng. A total of 65 companies applied for the distribution, but only five were designated later. Because he is an old store with more than 30 years of history, the Central Bank trusted him, so he was designated. Zhang Baiyuan said that Tongfengheng was designated by the Central Bank for entrusted distribution, and Zhan Liansheng informed him by phone. Gold was received sometimes from the Central Bank and sometimes from Tongfengyu. The prices of open distribution are the same for all banks, and the commission can be slightly increased during secret distribution.

Five Committees of the Council Re-elect Conveners, Threshold for Banquet Tax Changed from "Pieces" to 10,000 Yuan [This Newspaper News] The Land Administration, Public Works, Education, Finance, and Social Affairs committees of the Municipal Council held meetings separately yesterday afternoon.

Also, the important proposals passed by the committees yesterday include: (1) The Shanghai Western Coffee Industry Association and the Catering Industry Association jointly submitted a proposal stating that the starting point for the banquet tax is no longer applicable to noodles and music equipment halls, etc., and collecting taxes is illegal. It was resolved to change the starting point from 5,000 yuan to 10,000 yuan, and the rest of the original decision will be maintained, but it still needs to be approved by the general meeting. (2) The tax on private cars and heavy vehicles should be based on the central government's regulations on the multiple of pre-war taxation. (3) Regarding the issue of handling civilian land used for airport construction, the Land Administration Bureau should first clarify the area of the airport and the land to be enclosed before further discussion. (4) Private primary school principals should enjoy the right to government-distributed daily necessities. It was resolved to ask the municipal government to handle it. (5) Regarding the Executive Yuan's disapproval of converting Hongqiao Airport into an education zone, it was decided to send another telegram to request it. (6) To suggest that the central government and the municipal government reorganize various old debts and determine reasonable repayment methods, it was decided to invite Wang Weisi, Wang Yansong, and Xu Guomao to invite representatives from the financial community to discuss solutions at the Council on the afternoon of April 10.

Xia Zhongming's Case Continues, Denies Persecuting Patriots [This Newspaper News] The case of Xia Zhongming, former Deputy Director of the Puppet Investigation and Statistics Department, suspected of being a traitor, continued in the High Court yesterday afternoon.

All arrests and persecution of underground comrades were done by these two, and he did not participate in any of them. Because there were illegal acts among the secret service personnel, he reported to Li Shiqun and fired many people, fearing that this was the reason for the resentment and accusation. Subsequently, defense lawyer Chen Zhen presented many pieces of evidence favorable to the defendant. The court ruled that further investigation was needed and adjourned the hearing.

### Austin Explains at the Security Council the True Meaning of US Aid to Greece and Turkey; Requests Long-Term UN Patrol of Northern Greek Border

[United Press International, Lake Success, 28th] US Representative Austin delivered a speech today at the United Nations Security Council, requesting long-term UN patrols of the northern Greek border and drafting a far-reaching plan to aid Greece. However, before the United Nations begins to act, the United States must independently aid Greece. Austin also stated that when President Truman requested Congress to allocate $400 million in aid to Greece and Turkey to contain communist expansion, it was not limited to just Greece and Turkey. However, Austin's speech did not include words like "communism," nor did it specify which other countries Truman hinted at. Austin continued, stating that the United States upholds the right of all members of the United Nations to choose their own political system, but that this choice must be free and unthreatened, and that these countries must not infringe upon the rights or freedoms of other countries. The United States' aid to Greece, coupled with the long-term UN patrol of the northern Greek border, will certainly promote the realization of peace. The United States hopes that the United Nations will take effective action in threatened areas and that the United Nations will complete a far-reaching plan to aid Greece, but such actions cannot solve the immediate crisis. Austin's speech on Turkey was very brief, only stating that Turkey had repeatedly requested economic aid from the United States in the months before Britain announced that it would have to stop aiding Turkey after the end of March. The United States provided $95 million in lend-lease materials during the war and after its end, but had not subsequently approved this request. During his speech to Congress, Truman stated that military and economic aid must be provided equally to contain communist rule in Greece and Turkey. However, Austin only used the term "totalitarianism" and never mentioned the word "military." It is reported that Truman's plan to allocate $400 million in aid to Greece and Turkey to contain communism has caused unease among many United Nations diplomats, forcing the United States to offer an explanation.

[United Press International, Lake Success, 27th] US Representative Austin will deliver a speech at the Security Council on Saturday, clarifying the United States' policy on the Greek and Turkish issues. The speech will be 3,000 words long, and copies of the original manuscript have already been provided to the Soviet Union and other member states of the Security Council for review today, demonstrating its importance. [Agence France-Presse, Washington, 27th] Well-informed sources recently stated that the Senate Foreign Relations Committee unanimously supports submitting the issue of US aid to Greece and Turkey to a United Nations body for discussion.

### Wallace Opposes Military Aid to Greece and Turkey

[United Press International, New York, 27th] Regarding President Truman's plan to aid Greece and Turkey, Henry Wallace, editor of "The New Republic" magazine, recently stated his opinion that US aid to Greece and Turkey should be under the supervision of the United Nations and limited to non-military purposes. Aid to Greece should be of a relief nature and require thorough economic and social reforms in the country. Loans should not be granted to Turkey. Congressional leaders believe that the Senate is more knowledgeable about US foreign policy than the House of Representatives, so they have decided to let the Senate make the decision first. Senator Vandenberg, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, is currently urging prompt action, and it is rumored that debate may begin as early as April 7th.

### Rumor of Secret Compromise Between Soviet and France; French Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Denies

[Reuters, Paris, 27th] A spokesperson for the French Foreign Ministry denied rumors of a secret agreement between France and the Soviet Union in Moscow, saying that reports that Deputy Prime Minister and Acting Foreign Minister ThadÃ© Terk yesterday told the National Assembly's Foreign Affairs Committee in a closed-door meeting that Stalin suggested a secret agreement between France and the Soviet Union, supporting each other's policies towards Germany, are untrue. There are no proposals for any secret agreements between France and the Soviet Union. It is reported that a spokesperson for the Popular Republican Movement said yesterday that ThadÃ© Terk told the Foreign Affairs Committee that, according to a report by Georges Bidault, Stalin proposed that the Soviet Union support France's claims to the Saar region in exchange for France's support of the Soviet Union's plan for Germany, including establishing a centralized German government and increasing copper and iron production for reparations.

### Patterson Tells House Foreign Affairs Committee That Large Numbers of Soviet Troops are Assembled on the Turkish Border; Aid to Greece and Turkey Can Avert War

[Reuters, Washington, 27th] Secretary of War Patterson told the House Foreign Affairs Committee, which is discussing President Truman's aid plan for Greece and Turkey, that a large number of Soviet troops are now concentrated on the Turkish border. He personally believes that aiding Greece and Turkey is more likely to prevent war than to promote it. One committee member asked, "Assuming our goal is to prevent Soviet aggression, could the funds requested in this case be used more effectively elsewhere?" Patterson signed, "That region (Greece and Turkey) is of extreme strategic importance, and the money spent there will certainly not be wasted." Another committee member suggested that the United States consider "guaranteeing Turkey's borders." Patterson said that he felt this step would not be as effective as the financial aid plan. Patterson also said that the US government's intelligence on Turkish military equipment is not as detailed as that on Greece, but that the number of military personnel the United States plans to send to Greece is limited to only ten to forty people. Republican Congressman Munt suggested limiting the number of military personnel sent to each country to one hundred, which Patterson said he would not oppose. Another committee member asked about the strength of Soviet forces on the Turkish border, to which Patterson replied that the strength was considerable. The committee member also asked if the Soviet Union had any intention of moving into Turkey. Patterson said that the congressman's judgment was as good as his. Patterson also said that the Greek army uses British equipment, so parts should continue to be purchased from Britain.
