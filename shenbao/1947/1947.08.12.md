[Central News Agency, Taipei, 11th] Special Envoy Wedemeyer's C54-type Samsung special plane arrived in Taipei at 12:13 this afternoon from Beijing. Special Envoy Wedemeyer, wearing a grey suit, disembarked to the sound of music. Taiwan Provincial Chairman Wei Daoming stepped forward to shake hands with the special envoy to express his welcome. US Consul to Taiwan, Blake, was also at the airport to greet him. After inspecting the honor guard, the special envoy was accompanied by Chairman Wei in a car to the Yuanshan Guest House to rest. Wei Daoming had a deep friendship with Wedemeyer when he was the former ambassador to the United States. Today, the two men arrived at the Yuanshan Guest House together and had a long discussion on the second floor, with no one else present. According to the special envoy's press advisor, Watson, at the airport, the group plans to stay in Taiwan for two days, and it is not yet decided whether to visit southern Taiwan. The accompanying experts will be divided into groups to collect information on Taiwan's finances, industry, and engineering.

[United Press, Guangzhou, 11th] According to authoritative American sources on the 11th, one of the main purposes of General Wedemeyer's current visit to Taiwan is to find a location to train new Chinese troops. This troop training plan is expected to be led by American officers. The source also pointed out that the current 150 to 200 American military officers in China are the core of training Chinese soldiers, and will be expanded immediately after approval by President Truman and Congress. Furthermore, Taiwan is an ideal training ground for soldiers due to its convenient transportation.

[Central News Agency, Taipei, 11th] Special Envoy Wedemeyer and his team held an informal meeting at the US Consulate in Taiwan at 1:15 PM to hear a report from US Consul Blake and to receive various information provided by Blake. At 3:00 PM, they met with Barton, the manager of Jardine Matheson, a British company, Simbolei, an agricultural expert from the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), Dickson, a Canadian pastor, and Smiggin, the manager of the American Fraser Company, and received some information from the aforementioned four individuals. At 3:30 PM, Special Envoy Wedemeyer, accompanied by US Consul Blake, drove to Taipei Guest House to return a visit to Taiwan Chairman Wei Daoming and Secretary-General Xu Daolin. Reporters saw the four men sitting around a square table, talking for fifty minutes. The special envoy listened to Chairman Wei's speech and took very detailed notes. During this conversation, reporters only heard Chairman Wei speak, while the special envoy only occasionally asked a few questions. Blake also only occasionally added supplementary comments, while Xu Daolin spoke the least. After the special envoy left at 4:30 PM, Xu Daolin revealed to reporters that the content of the conversation focused on the general political situation in Taiwan Province and did not involve other areas. From 5:00 PM to 7:00 PM, the special envoy held a cocktail party at the US Consulate to entertain leaders of political parties, military and government agencies, representatives from the business community, and American expatriates. According to press advisor Bisson, in response to reporters' inquiries at the cocktail party, the team's mission in China is only to collect any information that can help clarify the "facts." The final decision will be made after returning to the United States. A reporter asked, "What is your country's special mission in Taiwan?" Watson replied, "Taiwan is a province of China, and its financial and economic aspects are affected by the Chinese mainland, just as the situation in the Far East is affected by the world situation. This visit to Taiwan is only to investigate a part of the overall situation in China and does not have any other special mission." The reporter also asked, "What is Special Envoy Wedemeyer's impression of Taiwan?" Watson replied, "It's too early to talk about impressions. We need to know the work." At 8:00 PM tonight, Chairman Wei hosted a banquet at the Taipei Guest House to entertain the envoy and his team, and invited US Consul Blake, Deputy Consul Faford, News Officer Jia Shu, and about 50 people from all walks of life to accompany them. According to a statement issued by the US Consulate, "Special Envoy Wedemeyer and his team are scheduled to hold a roundtable conference with Chairman Wei and the heads of various departments of the Taiwan Provincial Government at the Taipei Guest House at 9:00 AM on the 12th. The schedule for the afternoon of the 12th is yet to be determined." The statement also said that the special envoy will fly to Shanghai on the 12th and then to Guangzhou this weekend.

[Additional dispatch] It is reported that Special Envoy Wedemeyer may visit Keelung tomorrow afternoon and will stop in Kaohsiung for three hours on the 13th on his way to Shanghai.

### Memorandum of the Political Council; Foreign Affairs Group of the Standing Committee to Hold Secret Discussion Today; Ministry of Communications Has Not Requested Any Loans from Special Envoy Wedemeyer

[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 11th] The Standing Committee of the Political Council will hold a secret meeting of the Foreign Affairs Group at 9:00 AM on the 12th to discuss the minutes of the symposium of council members on August 5th and the memorandum submitted to Special Envoy Wedemeyer, the contents of which are: (1) A critique of the US Far East policy. (2) The Political Council's representation of the people's position and hopes for American assistance.

[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 11th] In response to widespread rumors that Wedemeyer's visit will involve a large loan to China to help build transportation infrastructure and the Tanggu New Port, the reporter inquired about this with Ling Shifen, an advisor to the Ministry of Communications, on the 11th. Ling said that Wedemeyer's main task on this trip is to investigate the facts. Although the Ministry of Communications has submitted a detailed list to him, it mainly describes the general situation of transportation and future construction plans, without any requests for loans. As for the US helping China build the Tanggu New Port, Wedemeyer was indeed very interested in the port during his visit to the north and expressed surprise during conversations with our personnel that such a large project was being undertaken with so little funding. The reporter asked if it was true that the US suggested building Zhejiang and Fujian into model provinces and strengthening railway and highway construction in those provinces. Ling said that this was not true. However, transportation projects in the aforementioned provinces are being actively developed, and a glance at the map will show the convenience of connecting transportation in Zhejiang and Fujian for the outward transport of goods from the interior. However, this type of construction does not necessarily rely entirely on external forces.

### Beijing-Shanghai Journalists' Delegation Visits Haikou; Most Residents Can Understand Mandarin

[Central News Agency, Haikou, 9th] The Beijing-Shanghai Journalists' Delegation arrived in Haikou City, the northernmost part of Hainan Island, at 11:50 AM on the 9th after a smooth two-hour flight. Shortly after taking off from Guangzhou, overlooking the Pearl River Delta, the land was submerged in water, the disaster having not yet subsided. Fertile fields were completely immersed, with only the crisscrossing paths vaguely visible. For 20 minutes, the view was obscured by heavy clouds. It only cleared up near Haian. The aircraft flew southwest along the coast at an altitude of 8,000 feet for about half an hour, crossing the sea to the south. All that was seen was blue water, blue sky, and white clouds. After a long time, land was sighted, which was Haikou City. We landed safely. Dozens of local colleagues gathered at the airport to welcome us and said, "Your visit is the first collective visit to Qiongzhou Island by the domestic press." The climate in the South China Sea is not as hot as imagined. Today, the indoor temperature here is still below 90 degrees Fahrenheit. The sea breeze is gentle, which is cooler than the capital when the reporters departed. After sunset, the heat gradually subsided, and the night was as cool as late autumn. Haikou, like other cities, does not have special tropical architecture. It is said that many of the famous coconut trees were cut down by the Japanese. The reporters only saw them once in the "Coconut Garden" where the commissioner's office is located. The Haikou dialect is similar to Chaoshan, but most residents can understand Mandarin and communicate with us in standard Mandarin without difficulty.

### Voter Registration Lists to Be Published Separately Before the End of the Month

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 11th] Voter registration lists for all constituencies nationwide will be completed by August 27th and published separately in each constituency by the 31st.

However, in the two months before the formal election of legislators, that is, the two months after the election of National Assembly representatives, if there are any increases or decreases in voters in each district due to changes in circumstances, they can apply to the competent election office for corrections so that the election can proceed accurately. Furthermore, a spokesperson for the General Election Office told reporters today that the election office is fully prepared for the steps to be taken to conduct elections in bandit-suppression areas and has ordered the competent election authorities in each area to compile a complete list of all voters as much as possible. If bandit-controlled areas are successively recovered, voter registration lists should continue to be created and reported so that voters in each area can exercise their due rights. As for areas with special circumstances, the election office has carefully considered measures to ensure that this election can be completed as scheduled.

### Interpretation of Two Points by the General Election Office on the Resignation of Incumbent Officials to Run for Election

[Our newspaper, Nanjing, 11th] The General Election Office previously prepared explanatory opinions on the location of the offices and jurisdictions of incumbent officials, as well as the starting date of officials' resignations, and filed them with the National Government. The full text of the explanation is recorded below: (1) Explanation of the location of the offices and jurisdictions of incumbent officials:

According to Article 8 of the National Assembly Representative Election and Recall Law, incumbent officials may not be elected as National Assembly representatives in the electoral district where their office is located. In addition to the scope of officials that has been explained by this office to the Judicial Yuan, the so-called electoral district where the office is located is intended to be interpreted as "the electoral district where the government office is located." For example, Zhenjiang County is one of the electoral districts for National Assembly representatives in Jiangsu Province and is also the location of the provincial and county governments. Therefore, all officials who are subject to restrictions according to the explanation shall not be elected as National Assembly representatives in the Zhenjiang electoral district. Although the locations of all government offices may be within Zhenjiang County, Zhenjiang County is also included in the entire Zhenjiang electoral district.

According to Article 13 of the Legislative Yuan Legislator Election and Recall Law, incumbent civil or military officials who are candidates in the electoral district under their jurisdiction or where their office is located shall resign five months before the election period. In addition to the issue of officials that has been explained by the Judicial Yuan and the issue of the location of the office that has been explained above, the so-called electoral district under jurisdiction is intended to be interpreted as all areas of the jurisdiction, whether partially or wholly, included in the scope of an electoral district. They must resign in accordance with the law before participating in the competition in the electoral district. The scope of the location of the office is relatively narrow and is mostly included in the jurisdiction and electoral district. The division of this legislator election involves merging several administrative supervisory districts into one electoral district and dividing one administrative supervisory district into several electoral districts. The relationship is complex, and it is more reasonable to take the electoral district as the main body. For example, the Second Administrative Supervisory District of Anhui governs six counties, including Lu'an and Hefei. Now, Hefei is assigned to the First Electoral District, and Lu'an and other five counties are assigned to the Third Electoral District. Therefore, officials within this commissioner's office, who are subject to restrictions according to the explanation, must resign if they want to engage in competition in the First and Third Electoral Districts of Anhui. The original intention of this article is to prevent them from using their powers to manipulate the election. Although only Hefei County within the First Electoral District is within their jurisdiction, the legislator election is based on districts, so it is not appropriate to designate a certain county as not allowing them to engage in activities. In fact, it cannot be assumed that all the votes they obtain in a certain county are obtained by manipulating their powers and are therefore invalid. According to this explanation, for provinces and cities that are not divided into districts, all officials who are subject to restrictions must resign in advance if they want to compete in the province.

(2) Explanation of the starting date of officials' resignations:

According to Article 13 of the Legislative Yuan Legislator Election and Recall Law, incumbent civil or military officials who are candidates in the electoral district under their jurisdiction or where their office is located shall resign five months before the election period. The principle for calculating the starting date of this resignation should be based on the date of approval. However, the prescribed period for this legislator election is only six months, and the election date must be at least one month before the completion of election affairs. That is, resignation must be done when election affairs begin. The period of five months is not easy to be fulfilled. If it must be calculated after approval, the response to the resignation application and the exchange of official documents will take months and weeks, which is not unexpected. These resigned personnel have no opportunity to participate in the competition, which does not seem to be the original intention of the legislation. In order to take into account the facts, for this election, the explanation is intended to be the date the resignation application is submitted. The date of submitting the resignation application must be communicated to the competent election office by the head official in the name of the agency. If the resignation is retained, it should be calculated from the date of resubmitting the resignation application. If the date of resubmitting the resignation application is less than five months from the election date, the resignation shall be invalid.

### Chief of Staff Chen Inspects Fushun; Expanded Organization of the Northeast Xing Yuan Is Being Implemented; Ma Zhanshan's Troops Prepare to Fight Back to Songbei

Although Xiong Shihui has requested to resign, according to a military official, he is sure to be retained by the central government. As for the establishment of three pacification zones under the Xing Yuan, it has not been heard. Chen Cheng is busy merging the Commander-in-Chief's Office into the Xing Yuan, and this work can be completed in the middle of this month, at the latest by the end of this month. It is reported that the remaining personnel of the Commander-in-Chief's Office and the Xing Yuan will be organized into a 40-man officer team. In terms of military reforms in the Northeast, it has been decided to establish four army corps, with Sun Du, Liao Yaoxiang, Chen Mingren, and Zhou Fucheng serving as the commanders of the army corps.

[Our newspaper, Pan Yang, 11th] The reporter interviewed Ma Zhanshan, who said that the order for him to serve as the commander-in-chief of the pacification of the five provinces in Songbei has arrived. He is now organizing a guard and will soon go to Changchun to establish the general headquarters. As for which troops he will command, it has not yet been determined. Ma Zhanshan stated that although he is old, he is willing to dedicate himself to the country and the nation until his death. He believes that there is a way to handle the affairs of the Northeast. The only problem is how to do it. Ma's 8,000 soldiers retreated into Xinjiang, and now 1,600 have returned. The Xing Yuan is trying to find a way to resettle them. The young and strong are enlisting in the army, preparing to fight back to their hometown in Songbei. The old will be allowed to live out their remaining years. Ma's troops established national defense in Xinjiang but were killed too much by Sheng Shicai. These returning righteous soldiers are requesting Ma to ask the government to seal up the Sheng family's property in the Northeast to provide for the living needs of the tragically deceased orphans and widows.

[Our newspaper, Shenyang, 11th] According to a military official, the Communist bandits are actively preparing for the sixth offensive, but the launch period may be after the sorghum matures in October.

[Central News Agency, Jilin, 10th] The National Army's mopping-up troops in the Ula Street area are still pursuing the victory. The National Army that advanced to Xiaojitun is now mopping up to the north and has made considerable gains. As for the rumor that Ula Street was captured by the Communist bandits on the evening of the 7th, sources concerned stated that the news is completely unfounded.

[Our newspaper, Changchun, 11th] Since the Communist bandits launched the fifth offensive in May, more than 20,000 refugees have fled from Songbei to Changchun. Although various sectors have provided assistance, it is a drop in the bucket, and their lives are becoming increasingly difficult.

### Qingdao Airport Is Calm; Rumor of Attack Is a Misunderstanding

[Our newspaper, Qingdao, 11th] The story of the black plane dropping bombs is completely inaccurate. Cang Kou Airport is calm and peaceful. According to I.M. Strong, a public spokesperson for the Marine Corps air transport base at the airport, he has investigated the rumor. The rumor is actually about the Liuting Airport, located 20 miles northwest of Cang Kou Airport. This airport has been abandoned and is now occupied by a unit of the Chinese Air Force. On the 9th, when a Chinese Air Force plane took off from Cang Kou Airport and passed over Liuting Airport, three bombs fell due to an unstable bomb rack. They did not explode, and there were no casualties or damage. The story of the black plane may be a misunderstanding of this incident.

### Spokesperson of the Democratic Socialist Party States

Zhang Junmai Went to Guling Purely to Escape the Heat

[Our newspaper report] According to a spokesperson for the Democratic Socialist Party, the opposition to the party's central committee from the "Provincial and Municipal Representative Friendship Association" was secretly instigated by someone. Initially, there were more than 30 participants, but some have since withdrawn. This matter should not be taken seriously. Party affairs overseas will be improved after Li Shengce and others return to the United States. Li is expected to go to Hong Kong in mid-month to wait for a flight back to the United States. Zhang Junmai went to Guling purely to escape the heat and for no other reason. Negotiations on universal suffrage are underway in Nanjing. If the chairman goes to Lushan for office, Zhang will visit to discuss national affairs. Regarding participation in local governments, the Democratic Socialist Party believes that it is not yet time to participate in practical work, and even if they participate, it will not have a major impact, so they are not enthusiastic.

### Huang Shaohong Discusses Reforming Provincial Administration

Believes Four Conditions Must Be Met

[This City News] Supervisory Yuan Vice President Huang Shaohong spoke freely to reporters yesterday about reforming local politics. Mr. Huang said: Based on my past experience in presiding over provincial administration, I believe that if provincial administration is to be reformed, the following points must be earnestly implemented: (1) adjust the organization, (2) unify powers, (3) give localities room to independently raise finances, and (4) give localities broad personnel rights. The above points were all mentioned at the recent symposium on reforming provincial administration held in Beijing. The government has paid close attention to them and is currently drafting a reform plan based on the above principles for implementation. Mr. Huang believes that in order to strengthen supervisory work and purify officialdom, the responsibilities of supervisory agencies should focus on reporting.

[Our Newspaper, Zhenjiang, 11th] The Construction Department reported today that the water level of Tanshaji in the Central Canal has dropped to 25 meters. If there are no special changes, it will decrease daily. Although the flood has receded, the fields have been completely submerged and the harvest is hopeless. Therefore, the disaster in Xuhaihuai counties has been formed, and post-disaster relief still depends on the assistance of all parties. The provincial government has drafted an overall plan for this, which will be gradually implemented after Chairman Wang returns to the province after the inspection.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 11th] The Ministry of Water Resources recently received a telegram from Jiangsu Provincial Chairman Wang Maogong stating that the current flood situation in northern Jiangsu has eased slightly.

### Our National Railway Construction Five-Year Plan

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing Air Dispatch, 11th] Our country's first five-year railway construction plan after the war has been formulated. The selection of all routes focuses on connecting the main political centers of the headquarters and the border provinces, consolidating military strongholds, promoting democratic economy, and emphasizing heavy industrial areas. As for the national defense routes, both coastal defense railways and land defense railways are given equal importance. However, under the principle of not violating national security, railway routes are designed to connect with important seaports.

Regarding the railway route construction procedure, before our country's industrialization reaches the planned goals, we should first focus on completing the main lines in the provinces of the headquarters, followed by the secondary lines in the northwest plateau, and finally encrypt the connecting lines of each line.

Our country currently has a total of 27,084 kilometers of railways, of which the Northeast accounts for 11,330 kilometers, the Interior accounts for 14,554 kilometers, and Taiwan accounts for 1,200 kilometers. Therefore, in the first five-year construction plan, it is not planned to build railways in the Northeast and Taiwan. It is planned to build 14,331 kilometers of new railways in the inland provinces.

The planned construction lines can be divided into three major systems: Northwest, Southwest, and Southeast:

Northwest System

The Northwest System is the transportation system of Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, Qinghai, and Xinjiang. In the future, it can be extended from Hami to Dihua, and from Zhongwei to Lhasa. The traffic in this area is connected to the relatively industrialized North China in Baotou and Tongguan, with Tianjin, Qingdao, Haizhou, and Hankou as its international economic gateway, and it is connected to Sichuan, which is qualified for industrialization, to the south. It is the vein of material exchange between the Northwest and Southwest. Also, the Lanzhou-Baotou line of this system passes through the Hetao irrigation area of more than 16 million mu.

Southwest System

This case is the transportation system of Sichuan, Guizhou, Yunnan, and Guangxi, and is characterized by the development of western Sichuan industry, the Shuicheng iron mine in Guizhou, and the connection with Sichuan and Hunan, which are qualified for industrialization. In addition to the original Yangtze River water passage and the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway, its international economic gateways include Guangzhou Bay, Guangzhou, and the Burmese border. As for the traffic between Guangxi Province and the Pearl River Basin, it can be connected from the West River to Wuzhou and then to Sanshui, or from Liuzhou to He County to Sanshui. In addition, General Liu Fei, the current Deputy Chief of Staff, once advocated building a direct line from Liuzhou to Shaoguan. It can still be studied and decided during future construction.

Southeast System

This system is the traffic system in Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Fujian, and the eastern part of Guangdong Province. Open up the four water systems of the Gan River, Min River, Pearl River, and Qiantang River, with Xiamen, a deep-water port, as its main international economic gateway. From Nanjing via Shexian, Guixi, Nanping, Zhangping Meixian to Guangzhou, forming a coastal line, which is actually the spine of this system. Although there are few mineral products in the southeast, agricultural products are still rich and the population is dense. The four water systems are oriented in opposite directions, and economic exchanges are most lacking. Now that we are opening up from the watershed spine, it will greatly promote the economic development of the southeast.

There are four other lines, whose functions are as follows:

(1) Kaifeng-Jinan Line: The significance of this line is to enable the Central China region to directly connect with Qingdao.

(2) Nanyang-Huayuan Line: Although the local significance of this line is a shortcut for the Han River basin to connect with the outside world, its extension line, whether it enters Guanzhong through Zijingguan or enters Sichuan across the Daba Mountains, has global significance. However, the extension line remains to be determined.

(3) Changzhi-Qinghua Line: Passes through a rich coal area and becomes a shortcut for Jin Province to reach the south. This is the line proposed by Weng Wenhao, the current chairman of the National Resources Commission.

(4) Chengde-Chifeng-Tongliao Line: Although it is an internal line in the Rehe Province, it is an important line to enter the Northeast while avoiding the coast.

The advantages of the above selected routes are that they first seek easy passage in terms of topography, and all of them take the development of the economy to promote industrialization as the primary meaning, while also showing the needs of national defense.

Five Frontier Lines

Among the above lines, there are five lines extending to the frontier, and it is expected that their operating income will be difficult to develop for a while, but we must not therefore think that they have no value in construction. The total length of these five lines is 3,692 kilometers, namely:

Lanzhou-Hami Line: 1,636 kilometers

Lanzhou-Xining Line: 250 kilometers

Xining-Yushu Line: 800 kilometers

Jishan-Kangding Line: 406 kilometers

Chengde-Tongliao Line: 600 kilometers

Five-Year Program

The route expected to be completed each year in this five-year construction plan is as follows:

In the first year, construction of 6,206 kilometers will begin.

In the second year, construction of 3,326 kilometers will begin, and the number of kilometers under construction will increase from 6,206 kilometers to 9,532 kilometers. In this year, 2,812 kilometers will be completed.

In the third year, construction of 3,917 kilometers will begin, and the number of kilometers under construction will increase to 10,637 kilometers. In this year, 773 kilometers will be completed.

In the fourth year, construction of 882 kilometers will begin, and the number of kilometers under construction will increase to 10,746 kilometers. In this year, 2,865 kilometers will be completed.

In the fifth year, 7,881 kilometers will be completed, reaching the goal of 14,331 kilometers.

Construction Cost Estimate

Regarding the estimated construction costs, in addition to the measured lines, the construction costs are estimated according to the engineering quantities in the measurement report. For all unmeasured lines, the construction costs are estimated by comparing the topography with the measured lines.

Calculated according to the price standard before the war (ie, the 26th year of the Republic of China), 14,331 kilometers of railways will require a total of 1,460,035,600 national currency, equivalent to 498,147,000 US dollars (US dollars are converted to national currency at 30 to 100).

Regarding the staff and workers required for the construction of the line:

A total of 27,094 high, medium, and low-level technical personnel.

A total of 48,624 high, medium, and low-level management personnel.

942,000 skilled workers.

4,720,000 ordinary workers.

### Teachers Fired by Beijing No. 1 Girls' Middle School Stage Hunger Strike at Education Bureau Director's Home

[Our Newspaper Beiping, 11th] The dispute over the dismissal of teachers at Beiping Municipal No. 1 Girls' Middle School has been ongoing for over a week. Starting last night, five dismissed teachers went to the home of Wang Jigaog, the director of the Education Bureau, to petition. Wang avoided meeting them. These five individuals are still waiting at Wang's home on a hunger strike. Peng Huaju (wife of Councilor Huang Yu), the principal of No. 1 Girls' Middle School, previously dismissed 12 teachers, including Liang Yiqiu, on the grounds of "negligence of duty." Most of these 12 individuals have taught at the school for 15 or 20 years or more. Unwilling to leave silently, they appealed to society and the Education Bureau, claiming that their dismissal was due to Peng holding grudges and wanting to appoint her own people. They refused to leave the school and simultaneously outlined Peng's ten major offenses, including corruption and appointing her own people. Peng defended herself, claiming that her actions were due to Liang and others relying on their seniority and being disrespectful to their teaching positions. At the same time, the students were also divided into factions, each carrying out extensive propaganda. The education authorities found this matter extremely difficult to handle and have been slow to resolve it. During this stalemate, they went to Director Wang Jigaog's home to petition at 10 PM last night. Wang avoided meeting them upon hearing the news. Liang and others sat waiting, expressing that they would go on a hunger strike until they saw the director. Eventually, even Wang's wife left with her young child this morning. Director Wang did not go to the bureau to work all day, and Principal Peng received a written order from the Education Bureau this afternoon. As of 8 PM tonight, Liang and others were still waiting at Wang's residence. They have not eaten anything in these 22 hours. The reporter just inquired by phone, and Liang replied in a weak voice: "We will persevere to the end." Guo Dengao, chairman of the Beiping Education Association, has gone to Wang's residence to mediate. The Education Bureau wants to disperse Liang and others to serve in various elementary schools, but Liang and others have refused. How this will unfold remains to be seen.

### Editorial: The Deepening of Britain's Crisis

British Prime Minister Attlee broadcasted to the nation yesterday, urging all the people to work together to overcome Britain's current crisis; and said that the current situation is comparable to 1940 when Britain was fighting Germany alone, appealing to the people to tighten their belts, work together with one heart, and overcome this difficulty. This broadcast, reaching the ears of the British people who have long been plagued by wartime control, made them feel the seriousness of the situation even more; under the circumstances, they naturally have no choice but to tighten their belts even more. However, behind their serious and heavy mood, they can't help but sigh and lament. After a long war against Germany and Japan and winning the victory, the British people originally expected that with the arrival of victory, they might have a chance to breathe; but the reality they faced was not the relaxation of wartime control, but the intensification of control, tightening step by step, and the degree of tightening was even greater than during the war. Although the British people know that the situation is like this and cannot be saved, they inevitably have a sense of disillusionment.

Attlee's broadcast was an appeal to the whole nation. Originally, Britain's economic situation has been deteriorating in recent months. The 1 billion US dollar loan obtained from the United States last year has been consumed very quickly. According to Chancellor of the Exchequer Dalton's estimation, this amount will be used up by October of this year. At that time, the precariousness of Britain's economic situation will be unimaginable. Although US Secretary of State Marshall has expressed that the United States is willing to provide further assistance to Britain, and the heads of Britain and the United States will soon hold discussions, Britain, for its own sake, cannot rely on US assistance for a long time: and whether US assistance can be as expected is also questionable. The US Congress is now controlled by the Republican Party, and they cannot fully support the government's policy of aiding Britain. It is also worrying to see that the relationship between the Congress and the President has not been satisfactory recently; moreover, Britain is reluctant to beg for alms because of its dignity. Therefore, in order to overcome the current difficulties, the Attlee government has drafted an emergency plan, authorizing the government to act expediently. The introduction of this bill has aroused strong criticism from opposition leader Churchill, who believes that if the bill is passed, it will be the death knell of British democracy and the birth of centralized politics. Even within the Labour Party, opinions were not unanimous. The right-wing elements have dissenting opinions, while the left-wing elements are dissatisfied with the government's lack of active attitude. When the bill was passed for the first reading in the House of Commons last week, the government did not receive many votes: therefore, some people are quite worried about the Attlee government. Now that the bill will be put to a second reading, it is the focus of attention of the general public.

According to our observation, the Labour Party now occupies an absolute majority in the British Parliament, and even if there are a few dissatisfied elements, the passage of this emergency bill will not have any impact; maybe the news tomorrow will be that the bill has been passed. But whether the passage of this bill can turn Britain's situation from danger to safety is also questionable. First, in order to seek Britain's self-reliance, after the bill is passed, the Attlee government will not only intensify consumption control, but also actively implement its socialist policies, such as the socialization of the steel industry. But the problem is: the decline in Britain's production efficiency does not seem to be entirely a matter of national policy, but a matter of equipment. Britain is an advanced country in the industrial revolution, because it was the first to adopt the trend, so its industrial equipment is mostly old and unsuitable for modern production conditions. Therefore, even if the Labour government implements the policy of socialization, it cannot make up for this innate defect. Just look at the fact that since the Labour government came to power, it has vigorously implemented the nationalization of coal mines, but Britain encountered a serious coal shortage last year; and what is even more noteworthy is that in the US loan, a large sum of money was used to import coal. Britain is famous for producing coal, but now it has to import it from abroad in large quantities, and the decline of British industry can be imagined.

Second, the current crisis in Britain is so profound, but the Attlee government is going forward bravely and doing its best to cope with the difficulties. This spirit is admirable. But what we want to point out here is: the Labour Party's great victory in the general election in 1945 was a reaction to the long-term war suffering of the British people. Whether their vision of the situation after the Labour Party came to power is the same as today is also questionable. Bread rationing, which was not implemented during the war, was implemented after the Labour Party came to power, and the rationing was significantly reduced thereafter. If the British people had expected such a day after the victory, even if they disliked the National Government, which had been dominated by the Conservative Party for a long time, whether they would have the same enthusiastic support for the Labour Party in the election is an interesting question. Although the Labour government can pass this emergency bill because it has absolute control of the parliament, whether this fully reflects the general intention of the British people at present is also worthy of study.

Third, due to the current crisis in Britain, the government is considering recalling overseas troops. This reminds us of the measures taken by the MacDonald government in those years, which greatly reduced Britain's military equipment, which eventually led to the rise of Hitler and the subsequent outbreak of World War II. The first Labour government was organized after World War I. At that time, MacDonald was an idealist, which caused an irreparable disaster. Now, after the Second World War, the British Labour Party has risen again to seize British power; but Britain is facing an unprecedented crisis. We hope that the Attlee government can not only safely overcome this difficulty, but also write a glorious and valuable page for British history!

[Central News Agency Batavia, 11th] Our Consul General in Batavia, Jiang Jiadong, took advantage of US Consul Foote's trip to Yogyakarta today and entrusted him with delivering an informal letter to Indonesian President Sukarno, requesting once again that he take effective measures to protect the safety of overseas Chinese in the mainland. Among them, it is stated that China's attitude towards the Indonesian independence movement will depend on how the Indonesian government treats the Chinese overseas. The two sides demanded that Sukarno immediately take the following steps: (1) Provide convenience to overseas Chinese, so that those who are forced to evacuate can return home, and return all property looted by the Indonesian side. (2) Punish the perpetrators. (3) Guarantee that there will be no more terrorist incidents against overseas Chinese in the Indonesian region. (4) Guarantee full compensation for the losses of overseas Chinese. It is understood that Mr. Jiang had requested Mr. Foote to provide a plane seat to go to Yogyakarta, but was refused because the small plane had too little capacity.

[Central News Agency Batavia, 10th Associated Press] Indonesian Republic Deputy Prime Minister Gani said today: There has never been an attack on Chinese overseas within the territory of the true Indonesian Republic; what happened was only Dutch aggression. He also said that the situation seems more complicated than it appears at first glance, but this does not mean that Indonesia is shirking its responsibility. Mr. Gai said that Prime Minister Sjahrir has ordered the military police to take steps to protect the lives and property of Chinese overseas.

[United Press New York, 10th] The British economic crisis continues to be highly valued by major American newspapers.

### Attlee's Broadcast Address Appeals to the Nation to Work Together to Overcome the Crisis

[Reuters London, 10th] Prime Minister Attlee broadcast to the British people tonight, using simple and straightforward language to urge the entire nation to work together to implement the government's broad plan to overcome the economic crisis. The Prime Minister stated that all the details of this plan could not be announced at once, but the people must have a spirit of willingness to sacrifice, extend working hours, bury themselves in hard work, and be prepared to learn new skills, become familiar with trade techniques, and perhaps temporarily refrain from demanding wage increases or improved working conditions. The Prime Minister's broadcast did not release any plans beyond those announced in the House of Commons last Wednesday, but only publicized the perilous state of the British economy to the people and informed them of their major responsibilities. He expressed confidence that victory could be achieved in this economic battle, and that Britain's natural resources and the industrial skills of its people could be fully utilized, providing a sufficient guarantee of this victory.

After pointing out that the crisis facing Britain today is no less serious than any serious situation in British history, the Prime Minister said that the British must intensify their labor to implement the following: (1) reduce foreign expenditure, even if every national suffers significant sacrifices; (2) increase domestic food production; (3) fully improve transport efficiency; (4) intensify production for export. He said: "During the war, we had to stop manufacturing other things in order to focus on manufacturing guns and other weapons. Today, we still need to concentrate all our efforts on producing what we need to achieve economic victory. I know that the implementation of this plan requires everyone to suffer hardships. The government has now decided on the outline of the plan, and its implementation requires the joint efforts of the whole country. The details of the plan cannot be determined at once, and must be decided for each industry as it develops. Therefore, every British person must be prepared to sacrifice their own interests to serve the interests of the whole, and the government should also distribute sacrifices equally as much as possible. For this reason, the government has already proposed a bill that, although it does not give the government greater powers than it had in 1945, will allow it to be applied to the current crisis. The government has made the greatest determination not to allow any obstacles to hinder our country's recovery. We now need the same personal effort as in wartime. We cannot only rely on the generous assistance of other members of our Commonwealth? Even if American friends have plans to aid Europe, we should still try to be self-reliant.

### Arousing Civic Awareness, Assisting in Suppressing the Rebellion and Building the Nation, Organizing a General Mobilization Assembly of the Cultural Sector, Preparatory Meeting Convened on the 15th

Pan Gongzhan, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Cultural Movement Committee, and Fang Zhi, Chairman of the Municipal Party Headquarters, in response to the general mobilization of the cultural sector in the capital to suppress the rebellion and build the nation, specially held a tea party at the New Lichadun Hotel yesterday afternoon at 2 PM to entertain the cultural sector and discuss matters related to the general mobilization of the cultural sector in this city to suppress the rebellion and build the nation. A total of 137 units from various cultural and academic organizations, as well as cultural figures, Wang Guanqing representing Mayor Wu, and Liu Haisu, Fang Qiugai, Su Xishi, Shen Sizhuang, Liu Shi, Hua Lin, Li Hao, Wu Siyuan, and others, more than 200 people, attended.

Saving Others is Also Saving Oneself

Chairman Fang first reported that the capital's cultural sector's general assembly to suppress the rebellion and build the nation had issued a declaration, clarifying the way to save the country and the path we should follow. The ranks of the Shanghai cultural sector are the largest. We should respond to the capital's cultural sector and hold a general assembly to suppress the rebellion, thereby expressing the path that should be followed in "saving others is also saving oneself." The government's suppression of the rebellion is due to the rampant communist bandits, who are destroying the country's recovery and construction. The cultural sector stands at the forefront of all sectors and should lead society. If we use the pens of the Shanghai cultural sector to launch a nationwide general mobilization to suppress the rebellion, it will surely be effective. We deeply know that guns can eliminate riots, while pens can expose anesthetizing smokescreens, and their potential power is extremely great. The main purpose of suppressing the rebellion and building the nation is to awaken the people's awareness. Only in this way can we use the power of culture to suppress the rebellion and build the nation on one hand, and assist the government in completing the great task of building the nation on the other.

Without Suppressing the Rebellion, There is No Building the Nation

Director Pan then reported that before the order of the country and society is stabilized, we should determine a goal: without suppressing the rebellion, there is no building the nation. Shanghai citizens are immersed in singing and dancing all day long. The cultural sector in this city has the responsibility to awaken the citizens. We must remind the citizens that the communist bandits are destroying transportation and coal mines everywhere. If they come to Shanghai one day, can all the tea houses, restaurants, dance halls, and companies still exist? Absolutely impossible. Cultural people are social mentors. For example, photography can expose their atrocities, and singers can turn their atrocities into songs and sing them all over the country. These are all achievements of the cultural sector's struggle. It is hoped that the Shanghai cultural sector will unite, determine goals, and uphold the principles of suppressing the rebellion and building the nation based on democracy. The cultural sector should show its conscience to the public and expose all the atrocities of the communist bandits that they know before the people. In short, today we want to build a new China, and a nationwide general mobilization to suppress the rebellion is indispensable.

Fifteen Units Recommended for Preparation

Then Wang Guanqing representing Mayor Wu, Liu Haisu, Su Xishi, Shen Sizhuang, and others spoke successively. It was resolved to establish a preparatory committee for the Shanghai Municipal Cultural Sector's General Mobilization to Suppress the Rebellion and Build the Nation, and the Shanghai Municipal Cultural Movement Committee, the Journalists Association, the Fine Arts Association, the Entertainment Association, the Literary Writers Association, the Drama and Film Association, the News Agency Association, the Publishing Industry Association, the Secondary School Federation, the Specialist and Higher Education Federation, the World Society, the Municipal Education Association, the Education Bureau, the Municipal Party Headquarters, and other fifteen units were recommended as preparatory members. It was decided to convene a preparatory meeting on the 15th, and the time and location will be determined separately.

### Important Developments in the Yu Sheng Case: Pistol Found in Malay's Dormitory, Shirt Stained with Blood, Queripel's Testimony Required, Extradition to the District Court Temporarily Postponed

[Report from this newspaper] The U.S. military police yesterday continued to search the dormitory of U.S. soldier Malay, who shot and killed Yu Shengxiao, who was engaged in black market gold speculation, and found a white summer shirt with blood stains on the cuffs. After鉴定, the blood type was the same as the blood stains left on the pantyhose a few days ago.

In addition, an important new development was obtained, that is, a pistol, caliber .32, was found in the ceiling, but it had been dismantled into parts. The U.S. military police have now sent it to the police station's gun registry. Once it is fully assembled, they will check for traces of recent firing. According to general observation, although it is not敢断言 that this gun is the murder weapon that shot and killed Yu Shengxiao before it is验明, it may already be very close to the truth.

The U.S. military police also sent personnel to meet with Queripel yesterday, telling him that Malay will be interrogated soon and that he will need to testify in court at that time. At the same time, he was warned: "If you do not appear in court, you will have to bear all the crimes alone." At that time, Queripel heard this, remained silent, thought for a long time, and frequently wiped sweat with a handkerchief, seemingly unable to overcome the difficulty. But after repeated warnings from the U.S. military police, he finally nodded in agreement due to the relationship of interests.

Queripel was originally scheduled to be extradited to the District Court for handling yesterday. Now, because the U.S. military court needs Queripel to testify, it has been decided to temporarily postpone the extradition. According to records, Queripel was fired from the工部局 patrol房 in 1938 due to fraud, theft, and misconduct. U.S. soldier Malay had also committed theft in Chicago, so the two people's actions were comparable and can be described as birds of a feather.

### Lake Bandit Liao Bingnan Gathers at Platform Mountain, Colluding with Communist Bandit Xue Yonghui's Troops

[Report from Our Newspaper, Wuxi, 10th] Last September, Yang Yanbin, the special envoy stationed in Taihu for the purpose of pacification, dispatched Guo Rong to Platform Mountain in Taihu Lake to pacify the lake bandit Liao Bingnan. By early November, the pacification was successful, and the group was organized and trained in Xukou, Wuxian County, and placed under the command of the Suppression Force, bringing temporary peace to the Taihu region. Unexpectedly, after the organization, Liao's troops, with their untamed nature, gradually dispersed and returned to Taihu Lake to become bandits, gathering with the unorganized bandits and causing trouble everywhere. Recently, bandit alarms have been frequently heard along the Taihu Lake coastline. In addition, the Jin Jiarang gang is also robbing in the lake. The Jinghu Railway Command, according to information from Wujiang, has confirmed that Jin Jiarang is indeed a bandit, and it is widely rumored that Liao Bingnan and his subordinates, such as Zhang Kuan, have colluded with the Communist bandit Xue Yonghui's troops to commit evil deeds. Details will be explored in subsequent reports.

Platform Mountain is located in the center of Taihu Lake, at the intersection of Wuxi, Wuxian, Changzhou, and Huzhou counties, covering an area of approximately ten acres. There is a Yuwang Temple on the mountain, facing south, with idols inside and two plaques: one reads "The First Mountain in the World," and the other reads "Heaven on Earth." There are no caretakers in the temple, and the inside and outside of the temple are overgrown with weeds. It is reported that Liao's troops do not live on the mountain but live in large sailing ships with seven or twelve layers of awnings, and the cabins are very deep. The mountain is 81 li from Wutangmen outside the south gate of Xijing.

There is a widely circulated myth nearby. Legend has it that there was no mountain in the lake at first. At one time, a large official's boat passed by the area, and suddenly a violent storm arose, causing extreme danger. The official threw his hat and clothes into the lake, but the storm still did not subside. Later, he jumped into the lake, and the storm stopped, saving the lives of everyone on board. Later, a small mountain rose in the lake, but the terrain was not high, resembling a platform, hence the name Platform Mountain. Before the war, in peaceful times, there was a temple fair every year, and most of the netting boat households would climb the mountain to offer incense, which was extremely prosperous. Now, it has fallen into bandit territory, with weeds covering the ankles and no signs of human habitation.

### Coffin Shops in Old and New Kaiyuan Have No Business, Owners Change Professions, "Digging Roads" to Rob Coffins, "Repairing Bridges and Paving Roads"

[Report from Our Correspondent Zhao Zhan, Changchun, 6th] Kaiyuan left a vivid and profound impression on the reporter. Old Kaiyuan is located on the north bank of the Qinghe River, and the city walls still exist. I arrived at this crude ancient city at dusk, as if I had stepped into the pages of a history book. There are no modern hotels here. I stayed in a feather inn converted from a coffin shop and listened to the owner complain. He said he was very unlucky. Now the dead cannot afford coffins. When the "Eighth Route Army" came, they dismantled the coffins in his shop, saying they were going to "build bridges and pave roads."

Leaving the south gate of Old Kaiyuan, crossing the Qinghe River, and taking a "yellow fish" cart for ten kilometers, one arrives at New Kaiyuan (the station). The streets here radiate outwards, and the appearance is neat, showing traces of the war. Bored soldiers have become grain vendors, matching wits with the inspectors. Pickpockets are extremely active, chasing corners with traffic police. The order at the station is very chaotic. There is a sixteen or seventeen-year-old girl with lively eyes and high, elastic breasts, constantly exchanging glances with passersby. She is a grain smuggler, which is truly a shameful and sad scene.

Suddenly, on the night of the fourth of this month, soldiers from the Dongjiao Sub-Garrison came to search, claiming to be looking for Luo Er.

When the boat arrived in Xinshi, it asked a fellow, Xu Changfa, to deliver it to the Zhenxing Egg Company. At this time, Lan happened to be passing by and was called to hand it over in person. Because he didn't know what was in the box, the owner of the company, Chuan Rongqing, was asked to open it on his behalf. As soon as it was opened, with a loud bang, the explosive detonated, and Fu and Lan fell to the ground and rolled around. Fu's hands were broken, which was unbearable to look at.

### Early Autumn in Paradise: Two Incense Seasons

[Special Correspondent Chu Yusheng, Hangzhou, 9th] Several nights of wind and rain have cooled down the late summer heat over West Lake. The lush green willows and the French parasol trees that dance in the wind have a few scorched yellow leaves mixed among the piles of parasol leaves.

Lingyin and Tianzhu Temples Enshrouded in Incense Smoke

The first incense season of autumn in Hangzhou is the night of the Goddess of Mercy's birthday on the 18th day of the sixth lunar month. Everyone in Hangzhou goes to the Three Tianzhu Temples and Lingyin Temple, or at least crowds to the lakeside. That night, all vehicles were carrying guests to Beishan to offer incense. Cars followed cars in an endless stream. Many people who couldn't hire a car went on foot. Hiring a pedicab from the lakeside to Lingyin cost 60,000 yuan, and a rickshaw cost 20,000 to 30,000 yuan. The simple vegetarian restaurants temporarily set up in Lingyin and Tianzhu numbered twenty or thirty. Fruit stalls and stalls selling small dried tofu, a specialty of Tianzhu, were arranged side by side. In Lingyin Temple, the loud sound of the bell struck the hearts of everyone. The main hall was filled with incense smoke, and the sound of "Namo Greatly Compassionate Guanshiyin Bodhisattva" echoed, as if begging for an early end to the war.

Cushions and Fortune-Telling Sticks Insufficient

The Upper Tianzhu Temple, Middle Tianzhu Temple, and Lower Tianzhu Temple were also flourishing with incense. The kneeling cushions for making obeisance were insufficient, so some people knelt on the ground and began to kowtow. "Remove, remove, remove!" The fortune-telling sticks were insufficient, and rows of people waited in line to draw lots. On the way to Upper Tianzhu Temple, the Temple of Guan Yu and others also inevitably benefited a lot. Such incense burning lasted all night. On the two thoroughfares of Inner West Lake and Bai Causeway, people rubbed shoulders all night long. The rickshaw pullers, seeing the public buses carrying people, became jealous and smashed two public buses.

Two Incidents of Vehicle Destruction

In the morning, travelers from Tianzhu and Lingyin wanted to return to the city. Rickshaw pullers and pedicab drivers bargained wildly, infuriating the travelers, who beat up several rickshaws and pedicabs. The rickshaws and pedicabs were frightened and fled one after another. This was an interesting episode, but not one to be emulated.

Boats and Drums, Lotus Lanterns on the Lake

The lakeside was truly packed on this evening. Boatmen knew that business would be booming that night, so they charged 250,000 yuan per night. Several companies and firms specially hired boats, decorated them with colorful lanterns, and beat gongs and drums inside the boats as they drifted back and forth on the lake. Some companies released lotus lanterns, with advertisements on them. As soon as the lanterns were placed in the water, people would rush to grab them. It is said that grabbing lotus lanterns is a custom on the lake, so people who came to the lakeside to watch the lanterns couldn't see them. According to the traffic authorities' statistics on that day, the income reached 395.5 million yuan. Other expenses were probably more than ten times that amount.

Second Incense Season: Pilgrimage to the Eastern Peak

The first incense season of early autumn has passed, and the second incense season is coming. The second incense season is the pilgrimage to the Old Eastern Peak Temple. The Old Eastern Peak is a statue in the underworld. At that time, it not only stirred up the enthusiasm of the citizens of Hangzhou, but also fascinated the villagers of nearby counties. Next, there are the birthdays of "Lord Thunder" and "Dangmu", for which people go to Chenghuang Mountain to offer incense.

The red maple leaves that dot the scenic spots will soon have their glorious season. Many people also go to Nine Creeks and Eighteen Gullies to see the maple leaves, and to Xixi to see the reed catkins. Last year's chrysanthemum season in Hangzhou was not very good. Various nurseries are replanting and cultivating, hoping that the chrysanthemums will bloom this year, coming together with the season of fat crabs! Chrysanthemum appreciation.

Hospital Director's Wife Donates Blood to Save Lives

Hangzhou has been experiencing an epidemic of encephalitis in recent days, and the mortality rate of this disease is as high as 70%. It is said that the Western director's wife of Guangji Hospital also suffered from this disease. After recovering, she is willing to donate blood to inject into patients for treatment. She also hopes that people who recover in the future will donate blood to save lives. We believe that other diseases may become epidemic in the autumn. Those who make money during the incense season should donate some to help the poor patients.

### Executive Yuan Explains Procedures for Raising and Lowering the National Flag and Playing the National Anthem: The National Anthem Should Be Sung Before Raising or Lowering the National Flag; The "Blue Sky, White Sun, and Red Earth" Score Should Be Played While the Flag is Being Raised or Lowered.

Singing the national anthem before raising or lowering the national flag is clearly stipulated in the flag-raising and lowering ceremony." Based on this explanation, the Ministry of Education has issued a special notice to all provinces and cities across the country.

### Six Players from the Singapore Island Football Team Arrive in England in the First Batch; To Begin Operations on the 23rd of This Month

[Reuters, London, 10th] The first batch of six players from the Singapore Island Football Club's expedition to England arrived today on a British Overseas Airways Corporation flying boat at Pool Water Airport. The remaining thirteen players are expected to arrive here gradually within this week. Singapore Island will stay in England for two months and has already arranged nine matches against top British amateur teams.

[British News Agency, London, 11th] The Singapore Island Football Team, entirely composed of Chinese athletes, has departed for England to participate in a four-week friendly competition with British football teams, starting on the 23rd of this month, for observation. This is the first time a wholly Chinese team has appeared in England. It is learned that six of the team members arrived here yesterday on a British Overseas Airways Corporation plane, and the remaining players will arrive here by ship in the next few days. People here are speculating about who will win the match between the Singapore Island team and several major amateur teams in London.

Random Notes on the Expedition

[Our Newspaper, Hong Kong Airmail] After the Singapore Island Football Team lost to the Malayan Chinese Team, it held a strict review meeting. In addition to the reasons for the exhaustion of troops and horses due to the quick-battle, Captain Feng Jingxiang and Hu Hao jointly pointed out that the refusal of a small number of up-and-coming players to follow the on-the-spot guidance, resulting in a distraction of military morale, was the main reason for the failure. This game can serve as a warning to arrogant players!

The good thing about this Singapore Island tour is the good management. The whole team adopts a collective life. Without special permission, they cannot move freely and attach great importance to discipline. This is the basic condition for a strong team.

"Little Sanzi" Qiu Ting set off with the army, but his foot injury has not healed. He only acts as a "spectator" in each game. When fighting the Malayan Allied Team, he was anxious to see it. He and "Desperate Saburo" Zhang Jinhai both stroked their painful feet and shared their pity.

The results of the expedition to date are only one defeat and one draw in more than a dozen battles. With limited manpower replenishment, this result can be considered satisfactory. It is estimated that the most goals were scored by Li Zhaorong, and the best performances were by forwards Feng Jingxiang and Zhu Yongqiang. The defenders Xu Jingcheng, Feng Kunsheng, and Liu Songsheng are all good, and the guest player Gao Shanlong is not weak either.

On the sea voyage from Singapore to Yangon, they took first-class seats. Here, the gentlemanly style is strong, wearing uniforms for dinner, pacing slowly, and speaking with a serious face. This group of "ball hooligans" is suffering and has a special taste in their hearts.

After completing the game in Yangon, the Tiger Team went to Siam to hold a charity match. On July 17, they first fought against the local veterans team, the Assumption College Team. The team was full of talents, but unfortunately, they were old and useless. They were beaten badly by Singapore Island. One after another, three goals in the first half and seven in the second half, ten to zero. The Tiger Team won the first major victory since the expedition.

### The Table Tennis Championship Has Yet to Produce a Winner: Shanghai Stars Defeat Jingwu Yesterday; Jingwu Suffers a Crushing Defeat of 2-5; a Re-match Will Be Scheduled Due to Equal Points

The second annual table tennis league organized by the Shanghai Municipal Sports Association Table Tennis Committee held its final match last night at 8:00 PM in the Shanghai Stadium's gym between the Shanghai Stars and Jingwu teams, after 27 rounds of intense competition. An estimated two thousand spectators gathered, suddenly enlivening the long-quiet Shanghai Stadium. The Shanghai Stars surprisingly prevailed, defeating Jingwu with a score of 5-2. As the teams are tied on points, the organizers have decided to hold a final rematch at a later date.

After the start of the match, Jingwu's Yang Kaiyun faced Shanghai Stars' Huang Zhisong. Yang Kaiyun played one level higher, repeatedly using chops and cuts, taking the lead with a score of 3-0. In the second match, Zhang Fuwei faced Cheng Aixin. This match was more intense than the first, and Cheng Aixin's stamina failed him, resulting in a 1-3 defeat to Zhang Fuwei. In the third match, Shui Hanga and Li Zongpei took to the stage. Before the match, it was predicted that Li would win easily, but Shui's resistance was expected to be sharp. After contact, Li Zongpei used short chops, leaving Shui Hanga with no room to resist. As a result, Li Zongpei easily defeated Shui Hanga in three straight games. The fourth match between Ouyang Wei and Fu Qifang was one of the most tense of the evening. From the start, both sides proved formidable. After a 2-2 tie, Fu Qifang exerted his remaining strength, repeatedly using fierce smashes, causing Ouyang Wei to make numerous errors. In the end, Fu Qifang narrowly defeated Ouyang Wei 3-2, tying the overall score at 2-2. In the fifth match, Xue Xuchu faced Chen Zengliang, resulting in a one-sided affair. Xue Xuchu easily defeated Chen Zengliang 3-0. In the sixth match, Wang Changhou faced Xu Sunjia. Wang was just recovering from an illness, and it was widely expected that Xu would win. However, Wang Changhou responded calmly, preventing Xu Sunjia from attacking and instead suffering a 0-3 defeat at the hands of Wang Changhou. The final match did not affect the overall outcome, as Shanghai Stars had already secured the victory. However, Yu Cheng still defeated Gao Hongxing 3-1, resulting in a final score of 5-2, with Shanghai Stars defeating Jingwu. The scores for yesterday's match are recorded as follows:

(Shanghai Stars) (Jingwu) Score

Cheng Aixin Zhang Fuwei 1-3

Li Zongpei Shui Hanga 3-0

Fu Qifang Ouyang Wei 3-2

Xue Xuchu Chen Zengliang 3-0

Wang Changhou Xu Sunjia 3-0

Yu Cheng Gao Hongxing 3-1

### Issue of Negotiable Instruments Being Used on the Same Day: The Bankers' Association Sends a Telegram to the Ministry of Finance; Suggesting Alternative Measures; Banks Can Still Accommodate Customers with Good Credit and Pay on the Same Day

[Reported by this newspaper] The Shanghai Bankers' and Commercial Association recently submitted a report to the Ministry of Finance regarding the issue of negotiable instruments being used on the same day, outlining five drawbacks of not allowing same-day use and suggesting a two-pronged approach for implementation. The main points of the report are as follows:

(1) Among current customers, those who receive payment for negotiable instruments on one hand and need to issue checks for payment on the same day are mostly factories and intermediary merchants. Factories often need to purchase raw materials on the same day they sell finished products. Because price fluctuations are difficult to predict, buying and selling often need to be done on the same day. Intermediary merchants, such as cotton yarn and cloth merchants and securities brokers, must issue checks to pay their own accounts payable on the same day they receive negotiable instruments from customers to pay for goods. Both of these types of receipts and payments involve a large amount of money. However, they are all based on actual commercial transactions in the market, and the total amount of credit in the market will not be expanded because of this same-day use. If it is completely prohibited, industry and commerce will definitely suffer greatly. (2) As a result of this trend, legitimate commercial transactions will inevitably switch to using cash. Legal negotiable instruments will lose their circulation effect, and the market's demand for cash will surge (in the current situation, cash accounts for about one-tenth of the daily receipts and payments of the entire financial industry; if general transactions switch to cash, the above ratio will increase by more than double). (3) For the above reasons, the Central Bank will have to issue a large amount of cash to meet the actual needs of industry and commerce. Whether this is appropriate and whether there are obstacles are matters of great importance. Conversely, if the Central Bank's increase in cash issuance is not enough to meet market demand, a cash shortage will immediately occur in the market. Underground money houses will take the opportunity to start up and engage in the buying and selling of cash. There will be different prices for cash and negotiable instruments for the sale of various commodities. The various disturbances caused by the ban on same-day use of negotiable instruments during the enemy puppet period serve as a warning. (4) If commercial transactions mostly use cash, the labor costs and risks involved in the receipt, payment, and transportation of cash will increase significantly, affecting social order. (5) At the same time, it will also cause industry and commerce to receive cash, and in order to avoid labor costs, some may no longer go through the financial industry, and social funds will become increasingly isolated from banks and money houses.

In short, the use of negotiable instruments on the same day is not for the sake of taking care of the needs of legitimate industrial and commercial customers and increasing their own service efficiency. Why would they willingly bear the risk themselves? Especially because it is related to the convenience of industrial and commercial receipts and payments, the circulation of legal negotiable instruments, and the maintenance of their own business, they are cautiously and carefully selecting methods to operate, so as not to fail the financial industry's mission to society. According to past facts, there are really no cases of bank closures or shutdowns due to the above reasons. It can be seen that as long as banks conduct strict screening and pay proper attention, this limited accommodation is still a good one. Therefore, we have carefully submitted our humble opinions, requesting that your department consider the commercial situation and supplement the regulations:

"If a bank customer deposits a negotiable instrument on the same day and issues another check for use on the same day, if the bank believes that the customer has good credit and that the amount of the original instrument can be paid on the same day, it may still be accommodated on the same day. However, this accommodation should be carefully selected by the bank and handled strictly."

In this way, it is hoped that the handling of business in the same industry can be ordinary and prudent, and that industrial and commercial receipts and payments will not have difficulties. We respectfully request your approval for implementation and cannot express our eagerness enough.

Regarding the issue of customers issuing checks with insufficient deposits or exceeding agreed overdraft amounts, the association has previously formulated measures to crack down on them, and recently colleagues have discussed preparing to strictly implement them. After implementation, it is expected that the number of checks returned for insufficient funds will be reduced, and the risk of same-day use can also be reduced. This matter is a fundamental solution and should be clarified together.

### Mostly Closing Transactions: Shanghai Stocks Decline Across the Board

Shanghai stocks were weak yesterday and could not rally. Buyers have already realized this, and their psychology has changed. Too many people are closing out positions, so the process has gotten worse and worse and cannot be revitalized. Except for Tongyi Yarn Factory in the Weipai sector, which was uniquely popular due to rumors of increased dividends, the most popular stocks were overwhelmingly sold off. In addition to the market's nervousness, the intensification of the decline in material prices made it even more difficult to cope with. Low prices appeared near noon, and Yonggong's stock fell to the limit one after another. A cloud of gloom enveloped the market, and the trend was very unfavorable.

At the beginning of the morning, Yongsha stock was delivered for immediate settlement and purposely traded down to the 200 yuan mark, while Yongsha stock for forward delivery rose slightly to 212 yuan. After the opening, the 223, 112 contracts of Yongsha stock for forward delivery were sold at 208 yuan, and the 117, 14, 65, 200 contracts were bought.

The 223, 112, 97, 207, 94 contracts were unloaded, retreating to 205 yuan. The 97, 232, 174 contracts were maintained at low prices, and the 224 contract vigorously bought Yongsha stock for immediate settlement, rising back to 211 yuan. After the entrance, the 8, 36 contracts were supplied, and the 97, 219 contracts were still accepted. The Tongyi stock was frantically raised by the 24, 23 and other contracts. There was good news that the capital increase would change from one to thirty and the interest payment would be 20 yuan. It was constantly stirring. The Tongyi stock rose to the limit. The 190 contract also bought Yongsha stock for immediate settlement and was still stable. In the end, the various popular stocks, such as Meiya, were very loose and flooded, and the situation got worse and worse. People's hearts were finally overwhelmed. The 224, 223, 94, 12, 171, 219, 153, 103, 235 contracts closed out their positions in unison, and the 132 contract also sold Yongsha stock for immediate settlement. The 22 contract of Yonggong stock respectively lowered the prices of immediate settlement and forward delivery stocks to the daily limit. At 10:20, Yongsha stocks for immediate settlement and forward delivery simultaneously broke into the 200 yuan mark. The 160, 129, 142 contracts forced Yongsha stock for forward delivery down to 196 yuan.

At 10:45, the 32 contract sold to cover short positions, and once rebounded a little. The 218, 231, 179 contracts were still sold, and the 147 contract vigorously sold Yongsha stock for immediate settlement, falling to 191 yuan and 193 yuan. At 11:15, the 223, 32, 153, 163, 40 contracts took advantage of the low price to buy up to 198 yuan, the 169, 180, 83 contracts were sold, and the 223, 162 contracts also sold Yongsha stock for immediate settlement, and near noon they fell to a low price of 190 yuan and 191 yuan. Under the supplementation of the 73, 131 contracts, the afternoon session ended with the 195 contract for delivery with the 198 yuan closure. The 76 and 204 contracts of Xinguang were absorbed, and there was a greater rebound.

After the close, the asking price of Yongsha stock for forward delivery was flat and weak. As a result, compared with last Saturday, Yongsha, Meiya, Huafeng, and Xinguang stocks for immediate delivery each fell by a little more than 5%, Zhongfa fell by 10%, Xinhua fell by a little more than 15%, Yonggong fell to the limit and then rebounded, and the price was reduced by a little less than 15%, Jingfu only fell by a little less than 5%, Tongyi rose to the limit and then rebounded, and the price increased by 5%, Shangwu, Zhongs, Guohuo, Jinglun, underwear, and Lian fell by 5%, cement, Datong, and Xinya slightly fell, and Wuhe and Rongfeng fell by 10%.

As for the old stocks off the market, Dasheng was still stable, and the remaining stocks were just average.

### Government Bonds Rebounded Slightly; Foreign Stocks Were Stable

Government bonds finally rebounded slightly yesterday, and people bought when there was profit. Although Room 360 bought, Rooms 555, 503, and 550 all sold, and the upward trend was blocked and turned weak. The Tongbing opened at 13,100 yuan yesterday morning, and the closing price fell from 21,300 yuan to around 11,700 yuan. Compared with last Saturday, Jiayi and Yiyi fell by 1,000 yuan, Tongbing fell by 1,900, Tongding fell by 1,400, and Tongwu fell by 1,300, with a turnover of about 6 million.

Foreign stocks rebounded after yesterday's weakness, and people's hearts turned around when they saw low prices. Yisha opened at 76,000 yuan yesterday morning, and the closing price rose from 75,000 yuan to 79,000 yuan. Although the Jinhao, Yeguangbang, and Zhengquanbang sold, the foreign banks and retail investors all bought. People generally have a different view of foreign stocks. As a result, compared with last Saturday, the prices of telephone and shipping stocks were still flat, and the remaining stocks generally fell slightly.

### The Licenses of Bachuan and Zhenghe Were Revoked; Limited to the Shanghai Branches Only

[Reported by this newspaper] After the suspension of business of Bachuan and Zhenghe banks, the National Bank dispatched two auditors, Hong Dashi and Yu Qian, yesterday to supervise the liquidation of the two banks. It is reported that the principle of liquidation is to urge the two banks to return ordinary deposits as soon as possible to protect the rights and interests of depositors.

It is also reported that the revocation of licenses by the Ministry of Finance is limited to the Shanghai branches only. The Bachuan headquarters in Tongling and the Zhenghe headquarters in Guangzhou, as well as the two banks' branches in other places, will not be affected for the time being.

It is also reported that Zhenghe Bank is well prepared and will pay in six installments starting on the 15th of this month. Customer deposits will be paid off by October 30, with a payment time of two and a half months. The amount of the deposit paid is divided into six types: 1 million, 5 million, 10 million, 20 million, 30 million, and 50 million. Depositors with 1 million yuan can be paid first starting on the 15th. Then, various types of clothing above 5 million will be paid in installments, and finally depositors with 50 million yuan will be paid. Bachuan is still preparing, and it is said that a method will be announced within Shanghai.

### The US Dollar Bond Solicitation Meeting Held its Fourth Meeting

### The Woolen Industry Opposes Japanese Goods; China Trust Bureau Guarantees Not to Dump Goods

Regarding the opening of trade with Japan, the government authorities have already made a decision in principle, that is, imports should be mainly raw materials, and imports of manufactured goods should be prohibited. It is reported that recently the first batch of Japanese wool, totaling 300,000 yards, has arrived in Shanghai a few days ago, and the China Trust Bureau is currently going through customs procedures for picking up the goods. The entire membership of the Shanghai Woolen Industry Association was shocked after hearing the news. It is said that the industry will convene a general meeting of all members within a few days to discuss countermeasures in order to oppose the import of Japanese manufactured goods.

It is also reported that the Shanghai Woolen Textile Industry Association sent representatives to the Foreign Trade Department of the China Trust Bureau yesterday to inquire and negotiate about the China Trust Bureau's order of 300,000 yards of wool from Japan. Yang Jinsheng, the deputy manager in charge of Japanese goods at the department, received them. The representatives specially handed over a letter stating the difficulties of the woolen textile industry and suggested that the Japanese goods be shipped abroad for sales. Yang immediately stated that the Bureau intended to export the goods early in order to avoid competition with domestic goods, so he guaranteed that he would never destroy the national industry and hoped that all woolen textile colleagues could rest assured that he would give a public reply in the near future.

### Finance Vice Minister Xu Baiyuan Came to Shanghai to Inspect the Work of the Circulating Audit Team

The Situation of the Inspection Was Said to Be Quite Good

[Reported by this newspaper] Finance Vice Minister Xu Baiyuan met with reporters from this newspaper yesterday. According to him, the main task of this trip to Shanghai was to inspect the work of the Fourth Joint Treasury Circulating Audit Team and the regular inspections of financial institutions conducted by the Ministry of Finance and the National Bank auditing staff. He said that the main task of the Circulating Audit Team was to audit the loan situation of national banks and bureaus and the use of funds by various manufacturers after obtaining loans. The general situation of the audit can be said to be good. In the future, the work of the audit team will also be extended to the loan work of the National Bank Discount Committee. The situation of the regular inspections of financial institutions conducted by the Ministry of Finance and the National Bank auditing staff was also said to be good. The recent suspension of business of the Shanghai Bachuan and Zhenghe branches was not related to the entire financial community because the scope of business of the two banks was limited and the Shanghai money market was quite loose recently. The Ministry of Finance has now decided to revoke the licenses of the Shanghai branches of the two banks.

The reporter then asked some questions, which were answered separately. The main points are as follows: (1) The issue of monetary system reform has been widely discussed in all circles since the visit of Special Envoy Wedemeyer. However, he said that monetary system reform is currently a secondary issue. The main thing is to gradually seek its realization from the entire economic plan. If the prior conditions such as the gradual balancing of financial revenue and expenditure and the rationalization of production are resolved first, then the issue of monetary system reform can be solved easily. (2) The Fourth Joint Treasury is discussing the detailed measures for order loans. However, the government has continuously held them in the past, such as this year's spring grain loans. Regarding the order loan case of the China Vegetable Oil Factory, a broad decision will be made at the Fourth Joint Treasury meeting this Thursday. In short, the government intends to handle order loans carefully and will only hold those that are closely related to the national economy and the people's livelihood. (3) Regarding the proposal to change the delivery deposit evidence money collected from Shanghai securities brokers to 30%, he said that he had not heard of it. He also said that the Ministry of Finance has not prepared to consider this.

[Another News] After arriving in Shanghai, Finance Vice Minister Xu personally presided over a meeting of the Fourth Joint Treasury Circulating Audit Team at 4:00 PM yesterday to give many instructions on the audit work of the team. After completing his official duties in Shanghai, Xu returned to Beijing by late train last night.

### Tea Sales Are Not Active

The tea market has not been very active, because various domestic sales teas, at this time of hot summer, are still selling steadily to local and visiting merchants, but since buyers have been continuously purchasing, the current demand has gradually been met, so they have no intention of buying eagerly. As for export teas, the French merchant Yongxing Foreign Company and Morocco agreed last month to sell 900 tons of Zhenmei tea. It is said that the export merchants in the city who accepted the order are mostly fully equipped, and they are all waiting for the ship schedule, so they are all taking a wait-and-see attitude towards any color. Transactions have decreased sharply, but the attitude of those who hold goods is still firm, remaining stable in the quiet.

### Cigarettes Continue to Rise

Yesterday, the cigarette market continued to soar. The appetite of buyers for the British Great Britain and Old Knife brands was particularly strong, and the price was pulled up sharply. The Chinese merchant cigarettes, such as Beauty and Golden Mouse, also followed suit and went up. It is said that the tax increase is bound to be implemented. The inventory in this street is very scarce. Although there are returned goods from other ports arriving in Shanghai, the quantity is small, and the needs of all parties are pressing. The adjustment of bargaining chips is still not enough, and the market is soaring under the shroud of buying interest.

Yesterday, ten Great Britain cigarettes hit a new high of 104 million yuan. The closing price in the afternoon was 103 million yuan, a sharp increase of 3.8 million yuan compared with Saturday. Old Knife cigarettes also rose by 1.3 million yuan to 7.9 million yuan. Wuhua Hademan rose by 35,000 yuan. The price of Chinese merchant carton cigarettes also increased by 5,600 to 1,500 yuan across the board, and the price of American carton cigarettes and canned cigarettes was flat.

### Central Trust Allocates Rayon

Allocation Price Lowered by 300,000 Yuan Compared to Last Week

[Report from this Newspaper] The Central Trust Bureau yesterday conducted its 34th allocation of rayon. Except for Dongyang Dafugui (東洋大富貴), which was priced at 22.4 million yuan, other brands like Tianqiao (天橋), Gaoshan (高山), Jin San Ma (金三馬), etc., were all priced at 22.3 million yuan, 300,000 yuan lower than the allocation price of the previous week.

According to a spokesperson from the bureau, the bureau has the authority granted by the Executive Yuan to consider lowering allocation prices. (Note: The Executive Yuan had previously stipulated that the bureau should handle the consignment sale or bidding of government materials with prices that are, in principle, 20% lower than market prices.) If external requests to lower the allocation price exceed the bureau's handling authority, then instructions must be sought from the Executive Yuan before a decision can be made.

[Another Report] Although the rayon allocation price has been reduced by 300,000 yuan, the silk weaving industry is still continuing its petitioning efforts. Therefore, various parties in the market yesterday remained in a wait-and-see attitude, and the market situation was extremely sluggish. The 120 Jin San Ma (金三馬) with luster fluctuated between 24.5 million yuan and 24.6 million yuan in the morning. In the afternoon, it was described as soft, with prices falling another 100,000 yuan compared to the morning, and transactions were exceptionally rare.

Factory-Woven Fabrics Listless

With supply exceeding demand, the market trend for factory-woven fabrics was sluggish. Although asking prices for various grades of high evenness fabrics remained unchanged from last weekend, buyer bids were very low, resulting in a lack of transactions. Yesterday, D-grade goods were quoted at 28.5 million yuan, with bids at 8 million yuan. E-grade goods were quoted at 8 million yuan for new silk and 7.5 million yuan for old goods, with bids only at 6 million yuan. Neither transaction went through. High-grade goods on a seven-day credit term were traded at 28 million yuan. Sales of high-grade dry-processed silk were slow. Ordinary goods on credit saw slightly more transactions, priced around 16 million yuan. The Central Trust Bureau sold Huian (徽安) small factory silk yesterday at a price of 19.085 million yuan. The market selling price is approximately around 20.5 million yuan.

Silk Fabric Sales Weak

Due to sluggish actual sales of silk fabrics, and the anticipation of upcoming sales by factories, the market was exceptionally weak yesterday. At the opening, Dacheng (大誠) goods were offered at 1,040,000 yuan, and Huaqiang (華強) goods at 300,000 yuan. It once reached 330,000 yuan, but then declined. The final spot price was 267,000 yuan, and forward dating at 290,000-300,000 yuan. Dacheng (大誠) spot goods were at 367,000 yuan, and forward dating at 400,000 yuan. Although transactions of grid-patterned "bi zou" (格子璧縐) were rare, the floor price was quite firm, with transactions at 4,700 yuan.

### Rice Market Mixed, Some Firm and Some Weak; Soybean Oil Fluctuations Narrow

Yesterday, a total of over 8,300 shih (石) of rice arrived in both the northern and southern markets. Market conditions were mixed, with some firm and some weak. New japonica rice was selling quickly, while medium and lower grades gradually fell by 3,000 to 10,000 yuan. Early-season thin japonica rice and improved strains of early rice experienced fierce competition and price cuts. Due to the hot weather, old japonica rice was seldom accepted. White Yin Yuan (白陰元) seemed to be slightly firmer. Glutinous rice owners were very firm due to steady production prices, and prices increased by 10,000 yuan. As for Xinfu (新埠) indica rice, Liyang (溧陽) continued to have deliveries to Shanghai, and the trend was flat.

Flour showed slight variations. Factory flour was initially tight but then loosened, resulting in little fluctuation. Imported flour had a lively demand, surging by 10,000 yuan, and miscellaneous brands also saw active demand, rising by 2,000-3,000 yuan. Factories were unwilling to sell wheat bran, and holders' sentiments remained unsettled, rebounding by 1,000 yuan. Taerun (台潤) soybean cake saw few sales, and the rural demand season had passed, gradually declining, dropping another 2,000-3,000 yuan, and Yingkou (營口) cake plummeted by 6,000-7,000 yuan. Various new supplies of miscellaneous grains were not weak.

Soybeans from Jiangxi (贛) and Hubei (鄂) arrived in rapid succession, and Zhejiang (浙) Eastern supplies were continuous. Market demand appeared light, and both new and old soybeans uniformly fell by 4,000-5,000 yuan. Broad beans had balanced arrivals and sales, with no price changes, but picked green beans saw active digestion and dryness, and most stir-fried goods saw slightly increased sales of 3,000-5,000 yuan. Continued imports of peas from Taiwan made the market appear firm.

Old soybean oil remained stagnant, its trend indefinite, with weak trading. New goods saw few buyers, dropping again by 3,000-5,000 yuan. Milled wheat had both low supply and demand, neither gaining nor losing. Red sorghum saw a decrease of 2,000-3,000 yuan, and corn experienced wild fluctuations, with newly arrived goods from Chongming (崇明). Public sentiment was soft, plummeting by 20,000 yuan. Raw kernels saw increasing price cuts, and sesame was hesitant.

The oil market in Guangdong (廣帮) remained unchanged, crude oil initially rose and then retreated, ending stable. Soybean oil saw no temporary gains or losses, and vegetable oil also saw little change. Clear oil was slightly soft, and sesame oil also saw no significant fluctuations.

### Sugar Market Gradually Stabilizing

Yesterday's sugar market showed a gradual trend towards stability as sales slowly increased. The association set prices, with No. 20 medium refined white sugar rebounding by over 10,000 yuan, to 563,000 yuan-560,000 yuan. Four-and-a-half refined white sugar in grass bags was at 725,000 yuan for spot goods, and 700,500 yuan for warehouse receipts. No. 24 coarse white sugar was at 710,000 yuan, and Taiwanese red sugar at 580,000 yuan. Shantou (汕) refined greenish sugar was at 440,000 yuan, up 10,000 yuan, and lower grade at 415,000 yuan, totaling over 200 bags. Allied Chemical white sugar in bags was at 615,000 yuan-610,000 yuan, and in baskets at 589,000 yuan. Xing 赤 (Xing Chi) good grade sugar was at 510,000 yuan-512,000 yuan, and lower grade at 412,000 yuan, totaling two hundred-odd items. Diao 靑 (Diao Qing) good grade sugar was at 350,000 yuan-355,000 yuan, and oily lower grade at 334,000 yuan, with over 200 bags traded.

Traditional Medicine Turns Firmer

Since entering summer, the market prices of traditional Chinese medicine have been languid and stagnant. With the arrival of this term of order, the market has slightly turned around. Various wholesale merchants have slightly increased their purchases, with Sichuan fritillary bulbs (川貝母), elephant fritillary bulbs (象貝), apricot kernels (杏仁), saposhnikovia root (防風), coptis root (黃蓮), magnolia bark (厚樸), and Yunnan goods (云化) seeing the most activity. Market prices have shifted from weak to firm. Recently, Songjiang (松江), Jiashan (嘉善), Jiaxing (嘉興), and Xiashi (硤石) along the Shanghai-Hangzhou (滬杭) Railway, and Huangqiao (黃橋) and Taixing (泰興) in northern Jiangsu (蘇北), have been more active. However, the purchasing power of various wholesale merchants is extremely weak. Purchases are mostly in small quantities, and entire boxes are almost never accepted.

Fir Timber Continues to Weaken

Production prices in Fuzhou (福州) are also trending downwards. If there are no other changes, there is little hope for improvement before the Mid-Autumn Festival (中秩節). Among foreign goods, Liuan (柳安) is still doing well in price because it has not yet arrived in port, but the number of transactions is limited.

### Enveloped in a "Profit-Taking" Atmosphere, Cotton Yarn and Cloth Plummet in a Straight Line, Most Yarn Prices Falling Within the Spinning Industry's Suggested Prices

Yesterday's yarn market saw the Spinning Construction Company (紡建公司) routinely selling 20-count coarse yarn, with negotiated prices reduced to 9.5 million yuan. However, most yarn prices in the market have already fallen within the negotiated price range, and actual sales to merchants have been minimal. With a "profit-taking" atmosphere prevailing, the market trend plummeted in a straight line. Towards the end of the day, 20-count Double Horse yarn (雙馬紗) fell sharply by 700,000 yuan compared to Saturday, to 9.3 million yuan. 42-count Blue Phoenix (藍鳳) fell by 600,000 yuan, to 15.5 million yuan. Special Double Horse (特雙馬) was at 12.2 million yuan, also down by 300,000 yuan. Other counts of coarse and fine yarn uniformly decreased by 200,000 to 600,000-700,000 yuan.

Yesterday's cotton cloth market further declined. Rumors circulated that a certain high-grade Shilin (士林) cloth from Hong Kong was being sold for only 400,000 yuan per bolt, Dilong (地龍) brand fine cloth at 340,000 yuan, and Yuan Bi Ji (元嗶嘰) and Zhigong Ni (直貢呢) at 320,000 yuan. Merchants in Shanghai reportedly already spoke of selling off goods, causing greater panic in the local market and a strong "profit-taking" atmosphere. Buyers were in a wait-and-see mode, and actual merchant demand was extremely low. Furthermore, outside speculators flocked to sell, causing prices to decline all the way.

In the end, 12-pound Longtou (籠頭) fine cloth plummeted by 20,000 yuan compared to last Saturday, to 389,000 yuan. Various grades of fine cloth such as Five Blessings Blue Chicken (五福藍鷄), Rainbow Ball (彩球), and Yang He (陽鶴) saw prices plummet wildly by 15,000-16,000 to 33,000 yuan. Other bleached cloth, fine twill, coarse cloth, "bi ji", "fu zhou" (府周), blue cloth, and Shilin cloth uniformly decreased by 5,000-6,000 to 20,000-30,000 yuan. It was also heard that Longtou fine cloth outside the market was quoted at 386,000 yuan, and someone was willing to sell.

### Reader Consultation, Legal Interpretation: A Widow's Immorality, Selling Ancestral Property and Engaging in Illicit Affairs with Her Uncle, an Unresolvable Family Tragedy

Dear Editor: I have three brothers, and we have already separated our households. I am the youngest and still live with my mother. After the outbreak of the War of Resistance, I joined the army. Not long after, my second brother passed away, leaving no sons but a daughter who is not yet an adult. My sister-in-law does not abide by womanly virtues, disregards the family, engages in illicit affairs with a relative (uncle), and steals and sells family property. Because we have been away for a long time, we have not inquired. Recently, she also sold three "jian" of ancestral land. My mother's advice has been ineffective, and she even claims that my mother has no right to interfere. If this continues, the family property will be sold off entirely. I ask: (1) Does a childless widow have the right to sell ancestral property? (2) If a childless widow sells all the ancestral property and then remarries, can the property rights be forcibly reclaimed? (3) Can the ancestral property that has already been sold be redeemed? (4) If the widow fabricates that the sale of the property is to repay debts owed by her husband before his death, or uses the excuse of being unable to support her daughter, how should it be handled? (5) In the future, if we want to worship our ancestors or adopt an heir for my second brother, how will we do so without any property? Respectfully submitted, Zheng Liang-kai.

[Answer from Lawyer Fu Kuang-lin] (1) A widow's right to inherit property is equal to that of her daughter. Except for being able to dispose of her own inherited share, she may not dispose of her daughter's unique property. If she abuses her rights towards her children, the closest relatives or a family meeting may correct her. If the correction is ineffective, a request may be made to the court to declare a suspension of all or part of her rights. (2) If the ancestral property is jointly owned, she has no right to dispose of it. If she disposes of it without authorization, the co-owners may sue the court to have her disposal declared invalid. (3) Since there is no right to dispose of jointly owned ancestral property, a request to restore joint ownership can be made. If the court rules in favor, it can be recovered at the original price. (4) It depends on whether there is concrete evidence. Otherwise, a detailed list of the estate should be submitted to the court within three months of the commencement of the inheritance, ordering the creditors to declare their creditor's rights within a certain period. The debts should be repaid proportionally according to the amounts owed to each creditor, with the estate being used for repayment separately.

### Rent Increases Again and Again

Tenants Hope the Authorities Will Quickly Establish Regulations

Dear Editor: We received a notice from the landlord stating that starting June 1, the monthly rent would be 450,000 yuan, calculated at 180 times the original rent. This translates to 30,000 yuan. From December of last year, the landlord suddenly increased it to 150,000 yuan due to high prices, which was already more than 600 times the government-set reference price. Helplessly, we paid it in consideration of mutual understanding. However, if we increase the amount again, it will be more than 2,500 times the regulations set by the previous government. In this alarming situation, we can only hope that the authorities will quickly find a way to assess a rent index so that tenants can follow the rules and avoid disputes and complaints. A Tenant in Shanghai, respectfully.

### Statement

— Xie Bingying (謝冰瑩)

The day before yesterday afternoon, Mr. Tang Guohua of the Northern Daily (北方日報) came to visit. As soon as he saw me, he told me that he had recently finished reading a novel I had written. I asked him what the name was, and he said, "Tenderness (溫柔)."

"What?"

I was very surprised and suspected that my ears had misheard, or that he had misspoken. I repeated the question:

"What is the title of the book?"

'"Ten-der-ness," Mr. Tang said louder, afraid that I still didn't understand. He explained further, "温 is the 温 in temperature, 柔 is the 柔 in softness."

"No! No! How could someone as rigid as me write an article on "Tenderness"? You must be mistaken. Please find this book and show it to me as soon as possible."

"After I finished reading it, I lent it to a friend, but I can write a letter asking him to send it back."

Next, we discussed several writing-related issues, but I kept thinking about that book "Tenderness" in my heart, wondering who would be willing to bury their own "literary reputation" to "support" my work. Perhaps the guest saw my unease, and he left without a long conversation. Half an hour later, Mr. Tang suddenly returned with a book called "Tenderness" in his hand, and he told me, "This was bought at a bookstall in Xidan Shopping Mall. There were many last year, but now there are only a few copies left. Maybe it's because you're living in Beiping, so they don't dare to sell it publicly?"

After saying that, he was dripping with sweat and rode off on his bicycle in a hurry. I wanted to pay him for the book, but he refused.

Looking at the title of the book and the ugly and unsightly faces of the women drawn, I knew that the content must be depicting eroticism. Upon opening the table of contents, the first article was indeed "First Taste of Tenderness from the Opposite Sex," which described a middle school student flirting with a waitress and fighting over jealousy; the second article, "Moon," was even more boring, actually flirting with female students. Most heartbreakingly, there were several places that mentioned studying in Beiping as "studying abroad," which made me doubt the nationality of the author of this book. In addition, the entire text was in "Kyowa language," which made you feel both hateful and pitiful at first sight!

At this moment, I received a letter from Taiyuan. I recognized the handwriting as belonging to Miss Tao. The last paragraph of the letter read:

"The day before yesterday, I borrowed a book called "Tenderness" from Mrs. Wang. When I saw that it was your work, I read it twice in a row. Unfortunately, there is no publication location or date."

The sentence "Unfortunately, there is no publication location or date," clearly indicated that she also had doubts. "Read it twice in a row," if that's true, she's been fooled too much!

Every writer has their own style. If you are used to her work, even if she changes several pen names, you will still know whose work it is. Just like Ms. Bing Xin (冰心) published a book called "About Women" under the pen name "Mr.," everyone knew that it was written by her because her style did not change even though her name had changed. I am naturally honest and unyielding. I am afraid I will never be able to learn or write this kind of "tender" article in this life. Now, the so-called "Shanghai Huazhong Publishing House" actually wants me to "steal" the "beauty" of others, which is really unbearable in my heart and unreasonable. I have to declare it.

The content of "Tenderness" is really impossible to criticize from a literary point of view. The stories written, except for the first one that took place in Hangzhou, all took place in Beiping. The cover of this book is printed with "Published by Shanghai Huazhong Publishing House in 1946," but there is no name of the publisher, no address of the publishing house, and no preface. This is very obvious, it is a trick played by boring traitorous literati; especially suspicious is that the articles all wrote that they were written in Shanghai in 1929. According to 1929, it was the 18th year of the Republic of China, and Beiping did not fall until the 26th year. What the book writes about is after the fall, which is really irrelevant. 1946 was last year, 18 years ago, so the works written should be a huge book that caused a sensation in the world, so how could it be so boring to only write about men playing with women, women playing with men's vulgar words, and judging from the content of the words, there was already a "Puppet Manchuria" 18 years ago, which is too much fun to take readers!

Enough! Enough! There is no need to cite any more examples. It is unforgivable for such boring literati to write this kind of despicable and obscene article to poison young people! And publishing it by impersonating someone else's name is extremely boring, and they deserve to die!

Friends who know about this incident and saw the news in the newspaper are very angry. They voluntarily offered to investigate the address of the "Huazhong Publishing House" for me and insisted on punishing the fake "Xie Bingying" according to law. But I think that since I have not applied for a patent for these three words, why be so serious? But in order not to "steal" the "beauty" of others, I have to make a serious statement.

### The Call of the Sea

— Tang Kuangying (湯匡瀛)

The sky is blue, the stars are blue, and the sea is blue. The time is the same as tonight: midsummer night. Your light and delicate hem rustles over the pebbles on the beach, making a musical and graceful tune, quietly like a melancholy nun. Your white dress sweeps past the low bamboo fences by the sea, letting the moonlight cast the beautiful shadows of the wildflowers on your hem. You walk on without paying attention, not even turning your head to look at the shadows of those wildflowers lying in the dirt, having lost their love.

"It would be even more interesting with a bit of flute music!"

You slumped down on a rock by the roadside, your eyes constantly looking at the sea, looking at the sky, looking at the twinkling stars. You love blue, but that night you weren't necessarily dreaming of blue in your heart; perhaps you were thinking about the distant journey tomorrow. These stars, sea, and sky tonight, when you recall them with a lonely traveler's heart tomorrow, will all be materials for a melancholy poem, which is why you felt melancholy.

In fact, in the thousands of years of human history, there is no place without the moon, no place without stars, no place without the sky, and no place without the sea. God does not need human tears and sighs to nurture this world, but the world is misusing tears, snot, and sighs to bury the light of the world. For example, tonight? Many soldiers are enjoying the cool breeze by the sea, and everyone has a world in their heart: when children frantically want to cross to the bottom of the sea to scoop up the moon to play with, adults' minds are filled with the tragic stories of shipwrecks in stormy seas; young men and women see the stars as the best symbols of loving couples, while older people worry about the sad separation of the Cowherd and the Weaver Girl. Just take this poignant flute song, how can you be sure that the person playing it is burying himself in an enclosure of melancholy?

However, as you said that night, "We are human beings, and human beings only have human reason and strength!"

Many people have gone far away from the green trees by the sea, never to see the old returning boats, and many people have hoarsely called out to the sea for their lost youth, and I don't know how many people cherish the laughter and tears around them, turning them into a blur. But the seaside, the pebbles on the beach and the wildflowers on the bamboo fence know these things best, but have they ever told humans anything?

You said, "Throughout the ages, the sea has been the biggest demon cave for burying human sorrow."

"If human tears were as plentiful as seawater, wouldn't the tears of the world be worthless even compared to water?"

Because of my reply, you were even more inspired to say, "Therefore, people sometimes seem so small, but sometimes they seem very great."

Over the past few years, I have been like a broken boat that has lost its mast. In the midst of violent storms, I always quietly anchor between bamboo fences and thatched huts, letting those nimble sailors use all their strength to sail past me, and letting them cast a hundred contemptuous glances at me, and I am determined not to return a single one. I am only like a homing pigeon, hiding under the eaves of the house, tidying up my feathers that have been drenched by the rain. I do not want to throw myself into the vast sea to become a low-energy hero with broken limbs. It is not that the sea and sky are not great enough, and expeditions are not grand plans, but I feel that sometimes a person who is desperately chasing after the times with sweat pouring down his face is not as lucky as a bystander.

At the moment you left the seaside, I also quietly hung my hat like a traveling monk in this small city three or four hundred miles away from the sea, counting the footsteps of lonely people on the streets late at night. I suddenly felt as if my whole body was covered with the breath of mud. I couldn't help but wonder: "When did I become a prisoner of the small city?" Listening to the night watchman's chime every night, I remembered the sound of the sea waves, and the blue stars, the blue sea, and your blue eyes filled with melancholy. So I opened the small window and looked into the distance, and I said: I want to call out to the sea, and let the broken voyage filled with tears sail from the place I am familiar with.

### Summer Insects

— Zhai Fang (翟放)

Cicada

At noon, the fiery sun, without any hypocrisy, shines down on the earth, shines on the stream, and shines on the cicadas on the banyan tree.

A string of white clouds in the sky, a string of cicada cries on the tree.

The cicada stretched its wings and cried.

The sound was like a broken flute, like a piece of red-hot iron thrown into water:

Therefore, I hate cicadas. Even more, I hate the sound of cicadas.

In spring, the chirping of hundreds of birds is a beautiful poem. In autumn, the bright cries of geese moisten people's complicated emotions. In winter, the eagles soar high in the cold sky, and people know that spring is not far away...

Only in summer, the cicada's cry subjugates all other sounds. Noisy, annoying...

When the leaves of the phoenix tree fall, the cicada slips away without a trace.

Bat

A streak of red is smeared on the horizon, and the birds returning to the forest are rushing...

Under the eaves of the house, one, two, three... black bats dart out, weaving, somersaulting, and gliding...

In this way, the poetic twilight of dusk is taken away by it.

Therefore: I feel confused.

The curtain of night is gently lowered.

Therefore: I hate the cunning of bats.

Frog Sound

Sholokhov said, "Loneliness is silent music, slowly playing elegies for people..."

But: bats are flying in the sky, and the sounds of frogs on the banks and at the base of the walls rise and fall in response, croaking...

I will light a cigarette and imagine without feeling lonely.

I will also take advantage of this not-lonely summer night with a not-lonely mood and rich emotions to write a page of poetry, which I will staple in my beloved collection of poems. Keep it for reciting on lonely nights without the sound of frogs...

With the sound of frogs, I will never feel lonely.

Firefly

Blue sky, green plains.

Summer night, stars in the sky: fireflies on the ground.

A dreamlike golden childhood is appearing. Like a poem, also like a corner of a tear-stained garment.

In childhood, on summer nights, sitting on my mother's lap, listening to stories about fireflies and fire:

"On the night of the Double Seventh Festival, the Milky Way in the sky is wide and bright, and the fireflies on the ground weave into a string of pearl lights, which is the light that the Cowherd uses to walk to the Milky Way to meet the Weaver Girl..."

This is a love story, and it is also the last story of my losing my mother's love.

A pile of yellow earth, a patch of green grass buried my mother, buried these stories...

Childhood is like a small poem, like a corner of a tear-stained garment. Ah!

The firefly brings my sorrow and remembrance.

### Lily

— Xiao Kangshi

Every year in the summer, vendors carry loads of lilies on shoulder poles, calling out in the streets and alleys.

According to the "Compendium of Materia Medica": The lily is also known as 　, Qiangzhai, Suannao 　, Chongxiang, Zhongfenghua, Chongmai, and Zhongting. It has a sweet taste, moistens the lungs, calms the heart, benefits qi, regulates the middle, stops nasal discharge, promotes diuresis and defecation, treats edema, abdominal distension, chills, fever, sores, breast carbuncles, and various typhoid diseases. The white flowers are used in medicine.

The "Miscellaneous Morsels from Youyang" records: At the end of the Yuanhe era, Xiahou Yi's courtyard in Hailing grew lilies that were several times larger than usual. He was surprised and dug beneath them, finding thirteen layers of brick boxes. Each box contained one, and the seventh box was untarnished, reflecting sunlight in a halo of one zhang.

"Old Scholar's Notes": During the Meng regime in Shu, ten lily plants suddenly grew among the flowers, with hundreds of blossoms all paired on one stem. Their image was painted on the eastern wall of the gate tower of the Shengtao Temple, called the Auspicious Picture.

Lu Fangweng built a small mound of earth in front of his window to grow orchids and jade hairpins. Finally, he obtained fragrant lilies and planted them together, playfully composing a quatrain: "Moving fragrant orchids all over the middle forest, why not plant jade hairpins after clearing the land? And ask for two clumps of fragrant lilies, the old man at seventy still has a child's heart."

Lilies are planted during the Autumn Equinox. Take the petals and divide them for planting, one clump every five inches. Chicken manure is suitable, and frequent watering will cause the flowers to bloom luxuriantly, filling the courtyard with a pure fragrance. They should not be transplanted during the Spring Equinox, and divided every two years to avoid dying. Ming Dynasty poet Chen Chun wrote: "The fragrance fills the room late at night, one suspects it is when one wakes from wine."

### An Inch of Land, an Inch of Blood 370

— Ye Jingfeng

This saying seems a bit exaggerated, but if you find any northeastern compatriots from that time and ask them, they might say it's even more "exaggerated" than that. The inhumanity and irrationality of the performances back then were even more "exaggerated" than that.

Leaving aside other things, just based on one unreasonable reason, this hostel could not escape suspicion: "Why did these two 'anti-Japanese elements' come to your hostel instead of going to another one?" The same reason could be asked of unrelated travelers: "There are so many hostels here, why did you have to stay in this 'anti-Japanese' hostel?"

Moreover, there's another point: Back then, whether entering or leaving Guandong, the "travel permit" had to be guaranteed multiple times and go through many troublesome procedures before it was issued. Along the way, at the numerous checkpoints, almost every major and minor station had records of this "travel permit." Given such strict control, once something happened, even if the perpetrator escaped, wouldn't those implicated be in trouble?

Of course, Yaoqun and Little Tiger's certificate was issued by the military, but if it were to be traced, it would be easy to uncover the truth. Therefore, although that withered old fellow looked repulsive and hateful, he couldn't be touched. He could only suppress his temper, answering every question truthfully, and every answer had to be based on something solid.

Just after that old fellow asked this question, before Yaoqun could answer, Little Tiger muttered: "Is this old thing even Chinese?" At that moment, the attendant behind them stepped forward and, with a burst of energy from his core, raised his voice and said:

"I say, Second Master Dong, these two are relatives of our old boss. They just got off the train and are only stopping here for a rest, not staying overnight... Besides..."

The attendant paused, turned to look at us, and lowered his voice: "This guy has ear problems... Quick!... Do you have proof of identity?... You must... Give it to me quickly..."

These two small but prominent actions fully demonstrated the content of the situation and the attendant's intentions. Yaoqun, being so alert, immediately took out the "permit" issued by the military and handed it over.

"Hey..." The attendant's eyes lit up as soon as he saw this special document, emitting a strange light. His large, round face, which was originally wooden and expressionless, suddenly relaxed, and he wore a strange smile:

"I say, Second Master Dong..." He raised his voice even higher, and suddenly presented the special document to the withered old fellow. ", Their background is really impressive... Do you recognize Japanese characters?... You don't!... I knew you wouldn't!... Look at this seal... Look at this official seal... 'Great Japan...' 'Permit...' This is... our writing... Absolutely certain... That's right, is this the photo, but are these two the people themselves?... Of course, there is no mistake, isn't it?... I say, Second Master Dong:..." (368)

Shanghai Ramblings

### Where Do University Candidates Go?

— Shilang

Universities across the country and in this city are holding entrance examinations these days. The number of candidates applying to universities this time is particularly high. One national university has already received over seven thousand applications, and the congestion at other schools can be imagined.

But what is the quota for each school? The university mentioned above, although it has seven thousand applicants, only accepts four hundred. That's a ratio of just over fifty out of a thousand. Where are the remaining six thousand six hundred to go?

We don't have statistics to check the total number of students coming to Shanghai to apply to universities, but just looking at the number of applicants to one university can give us an idea of the total number of candidates in Shanghai, which must be shockingly high.

So, where should these unaccepted university candidates go in the future?

It is said that the majority of the candidates this time are from Shandong and Henan, where their hometowns are in the midst of war. Their families' finances must not easily afford their tuition. They came to apply to universities, of course, hoping to be "publicly funded students," but the quotas of each school are limited. The large number of unaccepted young people definitely have no intention of returning to their hometowns. Most of them want to stay in the Beijing-Shanghai area, hoping to find an opportunity to work, either part-time or by thinking of other solutions.

However, under the impact of the depression, what method can Shanghai use to "entertain" these young students who have traveled from afar?

### The Closure of "Agence France-Presse"

— Aifubi

Editor's Note: Agence France-Presse's Shanghai bureau has stopped publishing news externally since August. We cannot help but express our sadness at the cessation of news by a foreign news agency that has had a long-standing relationship with the Chinese press. We have specially invited Mr. Aifubi to describe the internal reasons for the bureau's closure, as a kind of farewell "address"!

On the morning of July 31, 1947, Mr. Ganshibo, the director of Agence France-Presse's Shanghai bureau, announced in a very sad tone that the agency would stop publishing its Chinese and English drafts from August 1. From August 2, all Chinese and English newspapers in Shanghai no longer carried news reported by Agence France-Presse. The general public all expressed their regret at Agence France-Presse's quiet departure from Shanghai. From then on, the reporting of international news in Shanghai would be monopolized by American news agencies. Therefore, the cessation of news by Agence France-Presse is a great loss to readers who care about international news.

The reason for Agence France-Presse's closure is actually very simple. Post-war France has superficially restored its pre-war international status; but in reality, it was devastated by Germany during the war, its vitality was almost exhausted, and it could not recover for a while. Especially in terms of economics, although the United States has lent France a huge amount of money to engage in reconstruction work, all the loans are about to be used up now; the Ramadier cabinet is currently worried about the "dollar panic." Therefore, special attention has to be paid to all undertakings that require the use of US dollars. In order to save US dollars, the French government stopped subsidizing Agence France-Presse and demanded that it be economically independent, self-sufficient, and no longer rely on the government to subsidize it with US dollars. Under these circumstances, Agence France-Presse's Paris headquarters had to be reorganized. After the new president took office, he examined the income and expenditure of each branch and found that the income and expenditure of the Chinese branch were not balanced, and the expenditure far exceeded the income. Therefore, he sent Mr. Tan Shigu to the Far East to investigate the actual situation. From that time on, Agence France-Presse was affected by the dollar panic and was already in a precarious situation.

Tan Shigu arrived in Shanghai and went to Tokyo (twice), discovering a miracle: the Tokyo branch was still able to be self-sufficient; but the Shanghai branch had to rely on subsidies from the headquarters. Therefore, he decided to increase the fees paid to newspapers for articles from July. However, the press in Shanghai was also experiencing economic difficulties, and everyone held the attitude of "saving every penny possible." Tan Shigu discussed with Ganshibo and consulted with Chu Yukun, the head of the Chinese department. The three of them visited Mr. Li Zikuan of Ta Kung Pao together on a very hot afternoon. In addition to bidding farewell to the Chinese press, they also explained their intentions; from Mr. Li's conversation, an unfavorable impression immediately arose, making him believe that it was impossible for Agence France-Presse to be self-sufficient in Shanghai. The taciturn Ganshibo said with great emotion: "The situation of Agence France-Presse is as depressing as the weather today!" But Tan Shigu was still not disappointed and mustered great courage to visit Mr. Chen Xunjing of Shen Bao. Mr. Chen's attitude was completely different, not only expressing sympathy, but also agreeing to the request to increase fees. When Mr. Tan left the Shen Bao, he was beaming with joy, and a glimmer of hope arose in his heart.

After Tan, Gan, and Chu returned to the branch, they jointly drafted a letter requesting an increase in fees, demanding equal treatment for all newspapers. As a result, it was rejected by the Shanghai Press Association.

Tan Shigu returned to Paris, and the headquarters, seeing that Shanghai could not be self-sufficient, decided to instruct the Shanghai branch to stop publishing news. Ganshibo immediately rushed to Shanghai after receiving this call in Nanjing, gathered all 30 employees, announced the dissolution, gave double severance pay, and expressed his gratitude to all employees. The life of Agence France-Presse's Shanghai branch came to an end.

### Introduction to Famous Works: "I Chose Freedom"

— Chu Yukun

During the Great War, the United Nations, in order to eliminate the threat of Nazi forces, transcended "ideological conflicts," formed an alliance, fought side by side, strove for victory, and agreed to jointly create world peace after the war; but after the war, "ideological conflicts" revived and became the source of international divisions again. Not only can we not fully understand the actual situation in the Soviet Union, but also in the areas controlled by Soviet forces, because of the existence of the "Iron Curtain," it is impossible to explore the actual situation. This international division most easily leads to international misunderstandings, suspicions, and conflicts. During the Great War, knowledgeable people in the United States initiated an "International Freedom of Information Movement," wanting to maintain world peace through this; but the Soviet Union has not yet joined this movement; in other words, journalists from any country can go to any country to gather news, without any restrictions; the news gathered can be reported back without any form of censorship; after receiving the reporter's report, the newspaper can immediately publish it, without being affected by any forces. But today, reporters from various countries cannot freely go to the Soviet Union to gather news, let alone report news freely.

Although there are many books published about the Soviet Union, they are either promoting the Soviet Union or attacking it. There are very few detailed reports on the actual situation in the Soviet Union. Last year, Soviet writer Kravchenko published a book in the United States entitled "I Chose Freedom," which immediately swept the country and became the best-selling book in the American publishing industry last year. It arrived in China this spring and has also been valued by all sectors of our country. All parties have been looking for people to translate and publish it. As of today, three types have already been published: (1) The translated version by the Independent Publishing House; (2) The abbreviated version by the Tiandi Publishing House; (3) The abbreviated version by the Minzhi Publishing House. I have read all three of these different translated versions. But in the end, I feel that the translation by Qin Xuan of the Minzhi Publishing House is not only fluent and faithful, but also worthy of being called "truthful," "expressive," and "elegant." Personally, although I have more than ten years of experience in translation, I still feel that the structure of Chinese and English is different, and it is indeed not easy for translation to be complete in "truthfulness," "expressiveness," and "elegance." I know that after Mr. Qin Xuan translated it, it was carefully proofread by Mr. Cai Zhenghua, so I dare to solemnly recommend the translated version of Minzhi to readers.

As for why we want to introduce Kravchenko's work? Because the author, Kravchenko, is a standard Soviet worker, who was cultivated by the Soviet Communist Party and became the most famous engineer in the Soviet metallurgical factory; he not only has a scientific mind, but also has his own unique conscience and wisdom. Therefore, when he arrived in the United States, it was like being in another world. Everything in these two worlds is completely different; it made him feel that: although the Soviet Union is a socialist country, individuals have absolutely no freedom; although the United States is a capitalist country, everyone is free and equal. After his repeated consideration, he finally chose freedom, in addition to announcing his departure from the Soviet Union, he also asked the United States to obtain American citizenship. According to a recent report by the United Press, he will soon be able to obtain American citizenship.

He has no hatred for his motherland, but only feels that under the rule of the Communist Party, individuals have absolutely no freedom; he cannot but leave his motherland; the actual situation of the Soviet Union reported in the book is all true facts. In short, the Soviet Union is a country without freedom. "I would rather die than be unfree," this is the demand of everyone's conscience; the author's willingness to leave his motherland and choose freedom is worthy of everyone's admiration.

### The Death of Zhu Xinggong

— Xiyi

——Introduction to Martyred Journalists II

The number of martyrs among Shanghai's news fighters not only exceeds the sum of all other places in the country, but also more than all cultural workers who died in the War of Resistance; this alone is sufficient to fully prove how Shanghai's press fought fiercely against the enemy and puppets with their flesh and blood, risking their lives. Among them, the one who fought the enemy and puppets most bravely, died most tragically, and possessed the most upright spirit, regardless of life and death, was undoubtedly Mr. Zhu Xinggong, editor of the supplement "Night Light" of the Damei Evening News. In addition, Mr. Xinggong was also the first person in Shanghai's press to be subjected to a planned assassination by the enemy and puppets.

Mr. Zhu's name was Songlu, and his pen name was Xinggong. He was from Lucheng, Danyang, Jiangsu Province. He began working at the Damei Evening News on February 1, 1938, and served as the editor of the supplement "Night Light." At that time, it was shortly after the withdrawal of the national army from Shanghai, and people were in a state of panic. Mr. Xinggong wielded his like a oak pen every day, promoting justice and supporting the War of Resistance, especially with regard to the general traitors, he made the general traitors object of his cold irony and sarcasm, incompatible with each other, thus winning the general sympathy of the broad masses of Shanghai citizens, and at the same time arousing the strong enemy resistance hidden in the hearts of the public. Mr. Xinggong's old writing style was very profound, and his pen often carried emotions. His daily short commentary or miscellaneous feelings almost became the daily necessary reading material for some readers after dinner under the lamp. In addition, he occasionally turned his spare time to engage in chanting or other kinds of writing games, entrusting remote depth, skilled craftsmanship, and aiming to support the War of Resistance and denounce traitors. When Wang Ni Zhaoming published a telegram and then fled from the War of Resistance camp, harming the motherland under the protection of the enemy, all Shanghai newspapers unanimously condemned him, and the articles written by Mr. Zhu were even more poignant and moving, which made him even more jealous of the traitors. In the summer of 1939, the puppet Secret Service Headquarters sent threatening letters for the first time, but Mr. Zhu remained unmoved and rebuked the traitors even more forcefully. In mid-June, Mr. Zhu had just recovered from a serious illness when he received a threatening letter from the Puppet Chinese Kuomintang Anti-Communist and National Salvation Secret Service Headquarters, stating that if any anti-Wang characters were found in the "Night Light" edition again, "personnel will be sent to execute him." Upon receiving the letter, Mr. Zhu immediately drafted an article titled "A Confession from Someone About to be Sentenced to 'Death' by 'National Law,'" which was published in the "Night Light" edition on June 20. In thousands of words, he expressed his firm position with the great and unyielding spirit, determined not to submit or beg for mercy, determined to seek benevolence and obtain benevolence, willing to sacrifice himself for the country and the nation, and rebuked Wang Ni even more severely, saying that he had gone from Qin Hui to Liu Yu, and that if there was still one person in China, he would die to oppose him. After this article was published, Mr. Zhu's bright and pure heart was even more seen by the people of the country, and the traitor's intention to kill Mr. Zhu was thus determined.

At that time, Mr. Zhu lived at No. 94 North Henan Road in the Public Concession. That place was adjacent to Hongkou Zhabei, which was occupied by the enemy army, and it was not a safe area. The reason why Mr. Zhu lived there was mainly for economic reasons, in addition to taking it as a closer distance from the newspaper office. His monthly salary at the Damei Evening News was only one hundred yuan—it is said that a typhoid fever not long before his martyrdom had already left him heavily in debt—therefore, he had no choice but to live in that area, which was not safe but had relatively cheaper rent. On the afternoon of August 30, 1939, at 4 p.m., Mr. Zhu went out from his home as usual and walked to the museum to work. As soon as he walked to the vicinity of the Binjiang Building at North Henan Road and Tiantong Road, three thugs suddenly rushed forward from the roadside and blocked his way in front of and around Mr. Zhu. One of them took out a pistol from his sleeve and fired at Mr. Zhu's head. At that time, he was immediately shot and fell to the ground and died. When the police arrived and a ambulance was called by the police station to Renji Hospital, there was no way to treat him. As for the murderers, they had already fled in different directions when Mr. Zhu fell to the ground. On the afternoon of the day before Mr. Zhu's martyrdom, he had received a warning letter from the Puppet Chinese Kuomintang Youth Cultural Action Committee, threatening him and pointing out that he was unfavorable to the "peace movement." It was undoubtedly done by the pseudo-secret service of the Chinese traitor.
