[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 14th] The Third Plenary Session of the Sixth Central Executive Committee is scheduled to be held at 9:00 AM on the 15th at the National Assembly Hall. This historically significant building will once again receive this glorious task. In this meeting, the Kuomintang will discuss how to implement constitutional governance, return power to the people, and enable China to embark on a truly free and democratic path. The hall's entrance has been worked on overnight, adding a horizontal banner with a yellow background and long stripes of red, white, and blue. The top line is horizontally written "Kuomintang of China," and the bottom line reads "Third Plenary Session of the Sixth Central Executive Committee," with party emblems painted at both ends. The second entrance of the hall has a registration desk for attending committee members, still using the card format from the National Assembly. On the wall behind the rostrum inside the hall, a large portrait of the Founding Father and the party and national flags are hung. Twenty-two seats and oval tables are set up on the stage. Four party flags, each twenty feet long, are hung on both walls, and electric voting machines are also being installed. In addition to the First Constitution Regiment responsible for security, the police are responsible for traffic control, and the parking lot will be arranged as it was during the National Assembly meeting. The entire venue inside and outside is solemnly decorated. Today, Linsen Road is bustling with traffic and filled with dignitaries. As of noon yesterday, more than half of the Central Committee members have reported for registration. The area around the meeting venue is heavily guarded, and all Central Committee members must wear an entry pass to pass through. The meeting is rumored to last ten days, and this meeting will make extremely important decisions regarding the entire national policy.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 14th] The Third Plenary Session of the Sixth Central Executive Committee of the Kuomintang of China is scheduled to open at 10:00 AM on the 15th at the National Assembly Hall. President Chiang will preside in person over the opening ceremony. After the ceremony, he will lead all attendees to pay respects at the mausoleum. A preparatory meeting will be held at 3:00 PM in the afternoon to discuss the meeting agenda, the deadline for proposals, and elect the presidium of the assembly. This plenary session is the first since the return to the capital after victory and is held after the closing of the National Assembly and before the implementation of the constitution on December 25th this year. The timing and the meeting are of great significance, as it marks the Kuomintang's ending of political tutelage, returning power to the people, completing its fifty-year goal of leading the national revolution, and realizing the main goal of revolutionary struggle and striving for democratic politics. The question now is how to complete the preparatory work before the implementation of the constitution to guide the Chinese people onto the path of democratic politics. The convening of the Third Plenary Session is precisely for this task. Therefore, all reforms in party affairs, politics, economics, and diplomacy at this stage, as well as the streamlining of the tax system, the easing of tax burdens, and the preparation for the implementation of constitutional governance, are all under close study. This plenary session is held one year after the Second Plenary Session convened in Chongqing on March 1st of last year.

Approximately 565 Members of the Legislative Yuan to Be Elected

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 14th] With the implementation of the constitution approaching, all parties are extremely concerned about the election of National Assembly delegates and members of the Legislative Yuan. According to reliable sources, the total number of National Assembly delegates will reach 2,912. The first category is delegates elected from each county, city, and equivalent area.

### Fierce Battle Unfolds in Nong'an and Dehui

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 8:00 PM on the 14th] The offensive and defensive battle for Chengan, a satellite of Changchun, is now underway. Dehui County is also under siege by the Communist army. The Northeast Communist army seems to be trying to show off its strength during the Four Foreign Ministers Conference to dazzle international attention. The National Army will also not easily let go of the great opportunity to strike the main force of the Northeast Communist army. Heavy snow has been falling in the Songjiang area for several days, slightly delaying military operations, but the National Army's planned deployments are still being completed as scheduled. The next 100 hours will be the most decisive time.

### Yan'an Headquarters Decides to Launch Spring General Offensive

[Central News Agency, Beiping, 14th] According to reliable information, the Yan'an Communist Army Headquarters has indeed decided to launch a spring general offensive starting in March, targeting the Ping-Sui and Zheng-Tai railways as the offensive objectives, attempting to capture transportation lines first and then achieve complete occupation from a local level. The main force will be the various units under the Jin-Cha-Ji border region, supplemented by the Suiyuan and Kou-Liang military regions. Nie Rongzhen is the commander-in-chief, and Xiao Ke is the commander. The offensive area is divided into three routes.

### Speculative Capital is Hesitating and Watching; The Central Government Deeply Feels the Importance of the People's Livelihood Principle

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 14th] It has been a month since the promulgation of the economic emergency measures. On the surface, the chaotic situation in the economic world has been somewhat stabilized. However, according to observations by an economic expert, it is not yet time to be completely optimistic. The speculative capital in the market is currently in a period of hesitation and watching. If there is no appropriate way to guide it into the right track of production, it is still difficult to expect great results. A general review believes that the first priority of economic policy in the future should be to restore the government's credibility. In terms of policies and systems, it is necessary to make a major determination and show with facts that the government will never break its promise to the people. All measures should be considerate of the people's hardships and should not compete with the people for profits. It is necessary to ensure that production develops, so that people can use their talents to the fullest, others can use their resources to the fullest, things can be used to the fullest, and goods can flow smoothly. In short, economic policy must be based on the principle of the people's livelihood to be active. If one only knows how to accumulate wealth, it is definitely not the way to manage the country's finances. It is said that the central authorities have a deep feeling about this, which is a better sign before the Third Plenary Session.

### National Army Recovers Da Wen Kou; Fierce Battle for Si Shui in Progress; Communist Army Offensive in Jiaodong Also Crushed

[Our Correspondent in Xuzhou, 14th] The National Army, which had reached the south bank of the Wen River, crossed the Wen River on the morning of the 14th and recovered Da Wen Kou at 3:00 PM in the afternoon. The remaining Communist army fled in disarray towards Tai'an. Furthermore, the National Army, which recovered Feicheng on the west side of the Jinpu Railway, continued to advance north on the 14th and recovered strongholds such as Da Shi Town, Liu Zhuang, and Guan Wang Temple north of the city. They will soon join forces with the National Army advancing south from Jinan.

[Our Correspondent in Xuzhou, 14th] The battle for Si Shui is fierce. The National Army in Qufu is now attacking Si Shui from two routes. One route, after recovering Xing Shan and Jian Shan southwest of Si Shui, is now only two or three kilometers away from Si Shui. National Army sentries are now active outside the city gates of Si Shui. The other route of the National Army recovered Wang Xun west of the city on the 14th. The Communist army in Si Shui has become a turtle in a jar.

[Our Correspondent in Jinan, 14th] The Northern Expeditionary Army has completed a large encirclement of about 50,000 Communist troops gathered near Tai'an, including three divisions, one garrison brigade, and local teams. As for the eastern section of the Jiaoji Railway, after the National Army completed its new deployment, the Communist army's attempts to occupy Qingdao, Weixian, and Changle were all crushed.

### Communist Soldiers on the Border of Shanxian and Dangshan Defect with Weapons

### Molotov's Proposal is Unanimously Opposed Nationally

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 14th] Since Molotov proposed at the Four Foreign Ministers Conference that the China issue should be included on the agenda, protests have erupted across the country.

People's organizations and student circles in Hankou, Xi'an, Chengdu, Kunming, Tianjin, Jinan, Qingdao, Shenyang, Chongqing, and other places have launched patriotic rights protection movements and have held protest demonstrations.

Furthermore, more than ten universities in Shanghai, including National Fudan University, have established patriotic rights protection movement assemblies, preparing for class boycotts and demonstrations.

### Zhang Junmai's Remarks

[Central News Agency, this city] Mr. Zhang Junmai of the Democratic Socialist Party issued a written statement yesterday regarding the Moscow Conference, stating: "Recently, the fact that Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov proposed that the China issue should be included in the agenda has attracted worldwide attention, especially the exchange of cables in our country, expressing that our internal affairs should not be interfered with by other countries. This is a fundamental principle in international affairs that should be adhered to by any country. However, strictly speaking, if Mr. Molotov's proposal is regarded as interference in internal affairs, then how are the previous statements by the three foreign ministers in Moscow and the statement by US President Truman not criticisms of our internal affairs? As the saying goes, 'A country must insult itself before others insult it.' Another saying goes, 'The best way to stop slander is to improve oneself.' It is right for the people of our country to oppose international interference, but we must go further to seek the thorough democratization of our country's politics, the cessation of civil war, and the establishment of a coalition government. Then the four powers will welcome us to Moscow too much to reject the attendance of our country's representatives. Recently, domestic public opinion has focused on opposing international interference, in other words, not allowing discussion of the China issue. I believe that if China does not send representatives, other countries will naturally not be allowed to discuss it. However, since the four powers have already agreed to informally discuss the China issue, our country should immediately notify them of our participation and protect our rights in a dignified manner. We must never adopt the attitude of 'rejecting people thousands of miles away.' The China issue is part of the world's problems. If China is peaceful, the world can be peaceful. Our country should immediately plan to participate in the delegation to the Moscow Conference. It is most appropriate for President Sun Ke and Foreign Minister Wang Shijie to attend. The policies to be adopted are: (1) Strengthen friendly relations between China and the Soviet Union. (2) Clearly inform Russia that there are no secret agreements between China and the United States to oppose the Soviet Union. (3) China's disunity will be a barrier to friendship between the United States and the Soviet Union and a fuse for world peace. (4) The withdrawal of troops from the Northeast and the restoration of traffic on the China-Changchun Railway. (5) China is willing to resolve the Communist Party issue politically. A. Implement the troop reorganization plan. B. The Communist Party participates in the government. C. The administration of each province must be within the scope of the constitution. If the above five items are explained clearly to the four powers by our country's delegation, not only can our country's internal affairs embark on the path of peace and unity, but it will also contribute to friendship between the Soviet Union and the United States and world peace. Perhaps some people will object, thinking that this is our country's internal affairs and there is no need to defend it to outsiders. However, no matter how our country opposes it, the four countries will definitely raise this issue for discussion. It is better to be open than to be secretive, it is better for us to participate than to let others discuss it, and it is better to let this boil burst in the open than to let it lie dormant inside. This is a major key in our country's diplomacy and the world's political situation. I hope our government and the public will think about it calmly."

### Suggestion to Participate in the Foreign Ministers Conference; Legislative Yuan Resolves to Revoke

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 14th] When the Legislative Yuan discussed current diplomatic issues on the morning of the 14th, legislators such as Chen Anren loudly called for "diplomacy to strive for the initiative." Regarding the fact that the Moscow Conference will discuss our internal affairs within and outside the meeting, they all advocated that representatives should not be sent to participate. Today, the atmosphere in the meeting hall was激昂激昂 and enthusiastic, with applause coming from all directions from time to time. Foreign Minister Gan Naiguang was also invited to attend and reported on current diplomatic measures and made a detailed analysis. This important issue was caused by the "request to send representatives to participate in the Foreign Ministers Conference based on the Potsdam Conference resolution" proposed by legislators such as Chen Anren. After discussion, it was generally believed that since the government authorities had already announced that they would not send representatives to participate, the original proposal did not seem necessary to be established, and it was resolved to revoke it.

### Our Government Reaffirms Its Position and Decides Not to Send Representatives to Participate in the Foreign Ministers Conference; The US Representative Claims That He Will Change His Plan

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 14th] According to reliable sources: On the morning of the 14th, our government, through diplomatic channels, notified the four countries of the United States, Britain, the Soviet Union, and France, reaffirming our country's position on the Moscow Conference, clearly stating that China will not send representatives to participate in discussions on the China issue whether inside or outside the meeting.

[Our Correspondent in Nanjing, 14th] Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov once proposed convening a conference of British, American, and Soviet foreign ministers and inviting China to participate to consider the implementation of the Three Foreign Ministers' Statement on China in 1945. According to Chinese officials, the Chinese government's attitude was declared by Liu Jie in the previous statement by Foreign Minister Wang. The Chinese government has refused to accept the above proposal, because China was not a participant in the 1945 Three Foreign Ministers' Statement on China, and that statement involved China's internal affairs and was vehemently opposed by the Chinese people when it was issued.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 14th] The Standing Committee of the National Political Consultative Council held its 18th decision meeting at 9:00 AM on the morning of the 14th, chaired by Mo Dehui. Foreign Minister Wang was temporarily invited to give a diplomatic report. Mr. Wang gave a detailed explanation of matters related to the 草斯科 Foreign Ministers Conference and other matters. Subsequently, the proposals were discussed, and many important cases were passed. The proposals opposing the interference of the Four Foreign Ministers in our country's internal affairs submitted by the councilors totaled five. After being discussed and merged, it was resolved to pass them and send them to the government for prompt handling.

[Central News Agency, Moscow, 13th] Our Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Fu Bingchang, visited US Secretary of State Marshall this morning for a half-hour meeting.

[French News Agency, Moscow, 14th] The Chinese Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Chuan Bingchang, visited British Foreign Secretary 員文 again this morning, reiterating the Chinese government's opposition to any discussion of China's internal affairs by the British, American, and Soviet foreign ministers.

[Our Report] Moscow, 14th Broadcast: The US representative stated: "The Chinese government opposes participating in the discussion of the Chinese situation and refuses to send representatives to the Soviet capital. This matter will inevitably change the current plan."

[Our Report] Moscow, 14th Broadcast: According to reliable sources, the foreign ministers of the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union will discuss the Chinese situation with Chinese representatives in the coming days.

### Supervisory Yuan Issues Original Impeachment of Bei Zuyi and Others for Illegal Neglect of Duty; National Political Consultative Council Asks Government to Deal with It Strictly According to Law

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 14th] The Standing Committee of the National Political Consultative Council discussed today the proposal by Luo Heng and others to request the government to severely punish Bei 　詒, Lin Fengbao, Yang Anren, and other former central bank executives in charge, for taking advantage of their powers, colluding with officials and merchants, undermining national policy, illegally seeking profits, intentionally creating a gold rush, stimulating prices, thereby hindering people's livelihoods, and shaking the government's prestige. They should be immediately handed over to the judicial organs for strict handling according to law, in order to cleanse officialdom and warn against effect. The resolution was passed and sent to the government for prompt and effective handling.

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 14th] The four supervisory committee members, He Hanwen, Wan Can, Gu Fengxiang, and Zhang Qingzhen, who were ordered to investigate the gold rush, after submitting detailed investigation reports to the Supervisory Yuan, recently proposed an impeachment case to the Supervisory Yuan based on their findings, believing that Bei Zuyi, former governor of the Central Bank, Lin Fengbao, director of the Business Bureau, Yang Anren, deputy director, and Wang Songtao, assistant manager, had illegally neglected their duties. The case was handed over by the Supervisory Yuan to the supervisory committee members Jin Yufu, Wang Zixian, and Yu Shude for review, who submitted a review report requesting that Bei Zuyi and others be transferred for disciplinary action. The original text of the impeachment case and the review report were released by the Supervisory Yuan on the 14th. The original text of the impeachment case is as follows:

Original Text of the Impeachment Case

For the impeachment matter: The gold rush has had a profound and enormous impact on the national economy and people's livelihoods. The committee members were ordered to investigate the gold rush situation. After thoroughly investigating the actual situation of the Central Bank's execution of gold buying and selling operations, it was generally agreed that the bank's governor, Bei Zuyi, director of the Business Bureau, Lin Fengbao, and deputy director, Yang Anren, had the following illegal and derelict facts:

The Fraud is Clearly Visible

(1) The Central Bank's gold reserve figure is related to national secrets and has a significant impact on the future implementation of the gold policy. However, Bei Zuyi and others sold all the gold blocks and handed them over to Tongfengyu to be responsible for distributing them to Dafengheng, Hongfengyong, Shengyuanyong, Jiuchengyong, Yang Qinghe Fa Ji, Yufayong Xianghe, and other gold shops. They signed contracts to divide the gold bars into 99% pure gold and distribute them to various gold shops and silver buildings. The Central Bank gave Tongfengyu a smelting loss of three-tenths of an ounce per ten taels (see Zhan Liansheng's interrogation transcript). The Central Bank's entire sales of gold smelting volume has been made known to Tongfengyu. Furthermore, according to the statements of Zhan Liansheng and the persons in charge of Taikangrun, Fang Jiuxia Chang Ji, and Yang Qinghe Fa Ji (see interrogation transcripts), all the gold distributed by the Central Bank to the five designated firms had to be stamped by Zhan Liansheng, the person in charge of Tongfengyu, before it could be received. The total amount of gold sold by the Central Bank was made known to Zhan Liansheng. Tongfengyu is the largest firm in the gold industry, and Zhan Liansheng is an magnate in gold speculation. It is not difficult for him to deduce the amount of gold stored in the Central Bank based on this total amount and take the opportunity to engage in speculative duels with the gold policy to obtain huge profits. If Bei Zuyi and others did not intentionally leak this secret, they could have handed the gold bricks over to the Central Mint for melting. Even if the Mint's equipment was incomplete and it had to seek gold shops and silver buildings, it should have been entrusted separately and not entrusted to Tongfengyu to take charge of the matter, and let Zhan Liansheng be responsible for stamping. If the five firms designated to be responsible for gold distribution work (Tongfengyu, Taikangrun, Dafengheng, Fang Jiuxia Chang Ji, Yang Qinghe Fa Ji) were indeed designated by the Central Bank according to a certain standard, then they could each handle the procedures for receiving gold bars from the Central Bank, so why should Zhan Liansheng be solely responsible for this matter? The fraud in it is already clearly visible.

It is a Collusion Between Officials and Merchants

(2) The Central Bank sells gold and designates the above five firms to be responsible. The daily gold price is also determined based on telephone reports from the five firms to the Central Bank. The responsibilities of the five firms are very important. However, the Central Bank's designation of the five firms responsible for gold distribution work was all decided by Bei Zuyi, Lin Fengbao, and Yang Anren without any standards (see the gold rush investigation report), which is already inappropriate. Moreover, these five firms were all introduced by Zhan Liansheng alone (see interrogation transcripts). It is obvious that the Central Bank's sale of gold is intentionally controlled and manipulated by Zhan Liansheng alone in the market. It is not excessive to call it collusion between officials and merchants.

Secret Strategies of Unauthorized Sale

(3) The gold sold by the Central Bank every day, in addition to the explicit distribution issued by the gold industry and silver building guilds based on the applications of each member, the secret sale of gold bars, the Central Bank distributed to the five firms, and then let them freely dispose of them. Not only is the decision of the price controlled by Zhan Liansheng, but the limited gold of the country is exclusively for the infinite desire of gold speculation. The number of gold reserves is decreasing day by day, and the issuance of legal tender is increasing day by day. It is obvious that the Central Bank will have a day when it will be stretched and trapped. However, this secret sales strategy was not decided by the government and should be the office of Bei, Lin, and Yang.

Conniving at Suspicions of Subordinates

(4) After reviewing the gold bar sales accounts of the five gold distribution firms, there are dozens of gold purchases listed by Central Bank colleagues, totaling more than one hundred. Even Wang Songtao, who manages the gold inventory, also purchased gold bars. Bei Zuyi and others did not impose any restrictions on them, and there is suspicion of conniving subordinates to be involved in gold speculation.

Severe Punishment to Clean Up Discipline

(5) Bei Zuyi and others know the Central Bank's gold buying and selling situation best. Since the beginning of January this year, before the gold price gradually rose and the gold policy could not be sustained, Bei Zuyi and others should have reported the situation truthfully and made other good methods. However, it was not until February 8 that Bei Zuyi went to Beijing to ask for instructions. On the evening of February 9, he returned to Shanghai by car and suddenly announced the suspension of gold distribution the next morning, resulting in a sharp rise in gold prices and an unmanageable situation. The central government had to announce the economic emergency measures on the 16th. According to Bei Zuyi and others, this sudden suspension of distribution was ordered by the Chairman, but according to the committee members' investigation, the Chairman had no such instruction. From this, it can be seen that Bei Zuyi and others have already done wrong in their arrangements and have actually shifted the responsibility to the highest authorities, which is extremely illegal. Based on the above facts, the Central Bank's Governor Bei Zuyi, Director of the Business Bureau Lin Fengbao, Deputy Director Yang Anren, and Assistant Manager Wang Songtao, are obviously illegally neglecting their duties. Failure to severely punish them is not enough to cleanse the discipline and warn the evil officials. I hereby propose an impeachment case according to law and request that they be transferred for disciplinary action.

Review Report

For the matter of the review report: The case of illegally neglecting their duties of the Central Bank Governor Bei Zuyi and others impeached by Committee Member He Hanwen and others was handed over. After review by the committee members, it was generally agreed that the Central Bank's sale of gold to stabilize prices is a very important matter. The important responsible personnel of the bank did not make strict regulations in advance, giving奸奸 merchants the opportunity to profit, which is already a breach of duty. To entrust the responsibility of all distribution to the speculative merchant Zhan 　生 to handle, and to leak the secrets that should be kept in office to the contractor, there is obviously fraud in it. To allow the bank's employees to get involved and not investigate, there is even more connivance. When it is impossible to收拾收场, they claim that the Chairman ordered the sudden suspension of distribution, which is also illegal. The Central Bank Governor Bei Zuyi, Director of the Business Bureau Lin Fengbao, Deputy Director Yang Anren, and Assistant Manager Wang Songtao, should be transferred for disciplinary action, as a warning to those who illegally neglect their duties.

### Local Reporters Issue Declaration Opposing International Interference in China

[Local News] Shanghai journalists, in opposition to international interference, issued a special declaration yesterday stating:

On the first day of the Moscow Conference, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov actually proposed to include the China issue on the agenda. He wants to instigate the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union to jointly interfere in China.

This unfriendly attitude is not only an intolerable insult to the entire Chinese nation, but also an open provocation to general international law, especially the United Nations Charter.

Since the signing of the Sino-Soviet Treaty, the Soviet Union has consistently attacked China. The Chinese people's spirit of neighborliness and the Chinese government's friendly attitude have not changed the Soviet Union's prejudice against China.

At the first London Foreign Ministers Conference in 1945, the Soviet Union excluded China from participating in the drafting of treaties with Italy, Romania, Hungary, and Bulgaria. Subsequently, China was unable to participate in the second, third, and fourth Foreign Ministers Conferences due to Soviet refusal. Furthermore, at the Second Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference, at the instigation of the Soviet Union, the three foreign ministers placed China in the same category as the defeated vassal states of Europe in their declaration. The Soviet Union intentionally attacked China's status as a prelude to its future instigation of interference in China. Before this Four Foreign Ministers Conference, the Soviet Union again opposed China's participation in the meeting, with the intention of facilitating the instigation of interference. This conference was mainly to discuss the treaties with Germany and Austria. China is not a defeated country. Molotov openly demanded that the China issue be discussed on the first day. This shows that the Soviet Union has always held a strong power prejudice against China. As for its so-called Chinese internal affairs, it is just a worn-out excuse for power politics.

We must declare to governments of all countries around the world that China fought bloodily for eight years in the international anti-aggression war. The Chinese army and civilians made the most heroic sacrifices for the victory of the United Nations. China has contributed to the world and is not indebted to the United Nations. We will never recognize the right of one or several countries in the United Nations to interfere in China's internal affairs. So-called international interference is an inseparable part of power politics, which cannot be allowed to revive today and threaten human civilization and survival.

We demand that the government adopt a firm attitude and oppose any discussion of the China issue at any international conference. Now there is talk of the Soviet, American, and British foreign ministers discussing it outside the conference. Even this informal discussion is intolerable to China. The government must not send representatives to participate, and it must insist on opposing it to the end.

We demand that the government announce all the facts about the Soviet Union's actions in the Northeast since the Sino-Soviet Treaty and make them public to the world. The government has published too little about these facts in the past and should make the Chinese people and the world fully understand all the facts and know how those who want to interfere in China today are acting against international morality.

The government has the responsibility to safeguard national independence and dignity. If it can firmly maintain this position, we firmly believe that the people of the whole country will unanimously give their greatest support. Otherwise, the people of the whole country will certainly not tolerate the government's cowardice.

We are all engaged in the news industry and have always advocated international peace and cooperation. Now the Soviet Union's attitude towards China has made anyone who has good feelings towards the Soviet Union deeply resentful. Whether for the sake of international justice or national dignity, we must awaken the people of the whole country to transcend partisan prejudices and unanimously oppose the instigation of interference in China from a solemn national standpoint. We also earnestly hope that all people in the world who advocate peace and justice will pay attention to the interventionism advocated by Molotov, which is not only an insult to China but also a threat to world peace.

Editorial

### Expectations for the Third Plenary Session of the Sixth National Congress of the Kuomintang

The Third Plenary Session of the Sixth National Congress of the Kuomintang (KMT) solemnly opened in the capital today. This plenary session is the final decisive meeting of the KMT's highest executive body on the eve of returning power to the people and implementing constitutional government. The KMT's own direction and the evolution of future politics will depend on the outcome of this plenary session. Therefore, the significance of this plenary session is already extraordinary and, occurring as it does amidst the current volatile domestic and international situation, deserves the utmost attention from the people of the whole country.

The KMT not only has a long history in China but also has indelible achievements in the history of transforming China. In the past, from the Revive China Society and the Tongmenghui onwards, the KMT stood under the revolutionary banner of the Father of the Nation, led the oppressed people of the whole country, overthrew the Qing Dynasty, and established the Republic; overthrew Yuan Shikai and repeatedly established a republic; and then swept away the warlords and completed unification. Until recently, when the violent Japanese invaded, the KMT, under the leadership of Chairman Chiang, engaged in a holy war, enduring hardship and working tirelessly for eight years, and finally achieved a glorious victory and wrote off the unequal treaties accumulated over a century of humiliation. These are all contributions of the KMT to the country and the nation, which cannot be denied by anyone! They cannot be erased by anyone!

However, after the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the problem of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) arose one after another, and the fruits of victory began to rot, causing glory to turn into shame. This is a major tragedy in the history of China's transformation. Peace negotiations lasted for more than a year, but ultimately broke down completely due to the CCP's obstinacy and attempt to seize power by force. As a result, the flames of war spread, and northern Jiangsu, southern Shandong, central Shandong, eastern Shandong, western Shandong, northern Hebei, northern Shaanxi, and the Northeast all became battlefields where people were killed and rivers of blood flowed. People in the war zone were directly destroyed by artillery fire, and most were displaced, suffering terribly. Even people who were not in the war zone were indirectly affected, transportation was blocked, goods could not circulate smoothly, production was halted, supply could not meet demand, and prices soared, causing social unrest and making people's lives difficult. At the same time, in order to cope with the CCP's offensive, the government had to maintain a considerable army, resulting in huge military expenditures and uncontrollable inflation, which created the current serious situation. People inside and outside the party feel worried and anxious, depressed and gloomy, pessimistic, and even some people complain about everything and blame the KMT for the responsibility for creating the current situation.

If we are fair, the KMT has been in power for 20 years. It has failed to reform the political atmosphere in politics and improve people's livelihood in the economy, resulting in the current serious situation. The KMT really cannot but reflect on itself! Make up its mind and thoroughly reform the traditional system and style to open a new path for Chinese politics and lay a solid foundation for Chinese constitutional government. This is the responsibility that the KMT should fulfill to the country and the people. We are now in the transitional era of implementing constitutional government. As long as the KMT has the determination and perseverance, it is not difficult to make a fresh start with the people. However, all major reform plans will depend on the Third Plenary Session that opens today. In addition to wishing it success, we would also like to take this opportunity to respectfully tell the Chinese KMT a few words.

First, all members of the KMT should revitalize the revolutionary spirit. Only those who have a revitalized and full revolutionary spirit have the fearless spirit, can be optimistic and move forward, and can overcome the current difficulties. As far as the KMT itself is concerned, it has a broad, profound, and up-to-date ideology and a great and outstanding leader. As long as every member has a revolutionary spirit, even after the implementation of constitutional government, when political parties are numerous, the KMT will still be the largest party with the important task of peaceful nation-building. Now we often see people attacking the KMT as reactionary. Regardless of whether the reasons are sufficient, we always feel that KMT members should be ashamed of this and deeply reflect on whether their revolutionary spirit is revitalized and full, and then ask whether their thoughts and actions are outdated and regressive. If they are, they should correct them; if not, they should encourage themselves. Only in this way can the KMT maintain its past vigor. This plenary session will discuss the party affairs reform plan and the general inspection of party members nationwide. We believe that it is imperative to implement it; on the one hand, we can eliminate the base and corrupt elements who do not have a strong belief in the party, and on the other hand, we can gather outstanding people who are truly loyal to the party and loyal to the ideology to jointly shoulder the important task of peaceful nation-building.

Second, the KMT should redouble its efforts during this transitional era of implementing constitutional government to complete all the necessary preparations for implementing constitutional government and open a new path for Chinese politics. Because we ordinary people only hope that China will truly become a new democratic China, and as for the KMT, as long as the KMT itself is truly a democratic and centralized major political party, after returning power to the people, we still hope that it can shoulder the important task of peaceful nation-building. In fact, China and the KMT were inseparable in China's past history, and even in the future, it will not be easy to separate them for a while. Therefore, the KMT's efforts to prepare for the implementation of constitutional government are not only for the Republic of China, but also for the KMT itself.

Third, the reorganization of the government must be fully determined at this plenary session. We ordinary people have long hoped that the government will be reorganized, improve administrative efficiency, and eliminate corrupt officials, but it has been delayed again and again. Until today, the government has not yet realized it, which is really disappointing. We have said above that the greatest expectation of the people of the country for the domestic political situation is to immediately start preparing for the implementation of constitutional government, so as to establish a good model for Chinese constitutional government. Otherwise, time waits for no one, and in the blink of an eye, the date for the start of constitutional government will arrive. If there is no sufficient preparation beforehand, how can we hope that it will be a new look immediately after constitutional government begins?

Finally, we must also point out that people's livelihood must be stable, otherwise everything is out of the question; during this transition period, even if the government is reorganized, its foundation is expanded, and various parties are included, the government is still mainly composed of the KMT, and the KMT is still responsible to the people for all domestic and foreign affairs, as well as financial and economic measures. At present, people's livelihood is suffering beyond description. The KMT should always think of the people and always think of the country, and should not shirk any difficulties and bury itself in doing everything that is beneficial to the people and beneficial to the country. The specific methods of implementing equalization of land ownership and regulation of capital should be implemented to realize the ideal of the Three Principles of the People, and it must not be allowed to continue to let things drift and sit idly by while prices soar, resulting in social unrest and making people's lives difficult. When the Third Plenary Session discusses the economic reform plan, it must come up with specific measures to implement the Three Principles of the People.

### US Senate Committee Passes Preservation of Reserve Military Service Quotas; Both Houses Debated New Foreign Policy Yesterday; Aid to Greece and Turkey Should Be Decided Before the End of the Month

[Associated Press, Washington, 13th] The US Senate Military Affairs Committee, "due to the perilous world situation," unexpectedly passed a measure today to preserve all reserve registrations with local draft boards, pending congressional enactment of universal military service. The committee took no action on extending the Selective Service Act, which expires on March 31. However, at its last meeting, Secretary of the Army Patterson suddenly attended and expressed the view that, due to US intervention in the Greek and Turkish affairs, local draft boards' reserve registration lists should be temporarily retained so that they could be quickly mobilized if necessary. The committee then unanimously passed the measure to maintain the Selective Service Act as it stands.

At the same time, the highest-ranking officials from the Departments of the Army, Navy, and State are working to urge Congress to quickly pass President Truman's "communist containment" plan. They secretly reported to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that the plan for quick economic and military aid to Greece and Turkey is now only 18 days away from the UK's cessation of aid to them. The Washington administration's active preparation for parliamentary battles has been accelerated by Truman's public statement yesterday. It is heard that Secretary of the Army Patterson, Secretary of the Navy Forrestal, and Acting Secretary of State Acheson presented to Congress the details of how, when, and where the administration would use the Congressionally approved funds to stop the terrible expansion of communism in the Near East.

After a day of congressional meetings, Senator Vandenberg, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, predicted that Congress would fully support Truman's anti-communist plan. However, he warned that Congress is not blindly following the administration and will demand all important intelligence on the crisis in the Near East.

[Agence France-Presse, Washington, 13th] It has been learned that Representative Eaton, Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee and a Republican, is scheduled to propose a discussion in the House tomorrow on the President's proposal to loan money to Greece and Turkey. Eaton told reporters today that the House Foreign Affairs Committee is scheduled to hold a secret meeting tomorrow to discuss the entire international situation.

[United Press, Washington, 12th] Republican leaders in the Senate are preparing to quickly proceed with President Truman's aid bill for Greece and Turkey so that a decision can be made before the British troops withdraw on March 31. Senator Taft, Chairman of the Republican Policy Committee, said that March 31 is an important date. Senator Vandenberg, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, also said that this day is the deadline for the committee to hear opinions.

[Reuters, Washington, 13th] State Department experts say that most of the $150 million in US loans to Turkey will be used to strengthen Turkey's military organization against any possible attack. At least half of the $250 million in loans to Greece will be used to train and equip the 100,000-strong Greek army to prevent any incidents. Experts also said that US advisors in Greece will lead the Greek government to undertake major economic reforms.

### New US Diplomatic Trends Aimed at Preventing War

[United Press New York, 13th] The new development in American foreign policy is not about actual warfare. Its main intention remains to accomplish what Western nations failed to do more than a decade ago, which is to prevent war. On the other hand, this is an extension of the Monroe Doctrine, expanding the sphere of freedom to any people anywhere, not just the Western Hemisphere. President Truman has in effect declared that America's past war aims were not to replace one form of totalitarianism with another. America intends to extend its protective forces overseas to oppose such a replacement and establish outposts against its intrusion into what America considers its own world. In the coming years, disputes may arise frequently, but the most pressing effect of this policy is to reduce the possibility of actual war.

[United Press Washington, 13th] If President Truman's policy of aiding free nations is expanded, then Korea and Hungary will be at the forefront of the candidate list. Some government officials are already drafting plans to aid the two countries. The plight of each country is, at least in part, the result of Soviet pressure, similar to the situations in Greece and Turkey. Judging from the United States' foreign aid since Victory Day, it can be seen that if the policy President Truman revealed to Congress is implemented worldwide, it may later include China and Italy. However, whether other countries in the democratic front can ultimately request American aid remains to be determined.

### Senate Begins Foreign Policy Debate

[United Press Washington, 13th] The Senate debated foreign policy vigorously tonight. Republican Senator Brooks stated that the United States had provided billions of dollars in Lend-Lease to the Soviet Union during the war, and now it must "fight it." President Truman yesterday requested $400 million to aid Greece and Turkey to stop the expansion of Soviet influence. We now regret not having allowed the German army to annex the Soviet Union. If we had not helped the Soviet Union at that time, there would be no threat of world communism today. We must start anew. The first step is to send military advisors, the second step is to send troops and tanks, and the third step is war.

[United Press Washington, 13th] Republican Senator Brooks commented on the President's speech: "I want the government to explain what is the difference between the Chinese Communists and the Greek Communists." Congressman O'Connors said: "If we want to stop communism, why not stop domestic communism first? Why not stop communism in South America? Why not help Spain expel its communists? There are opportunities to stop communism in all of these places, but expelling the communists from Greece is not possible."

### Purging Nazis in Germany: Four Foreign Ministers Engage in Heated Debate, USSR Agrees to Allow Smaller Nations to Participate in Discussions on German Peace Treaty

[Reported by this newspaper] London, 14th Broadcast: The four foreign undersecretaries and military experts resumed preparatory work on the German-Austrian peace treaty at 11 o'clock this morning. The four major powers' foreign ministers held their fifth meeting at 4 pm (Moscow time).

[United Press Moscow, 13th] The four foreign ministers, in their discussion of the Austrian peace treaty, have agreed that in the future, any Austrian military officers who served in Hitler's army may not hold ranks above colonel.

[Reported by this newspaper] Moscow, 14th Broadcast: The Soviet Union has agreed in principle to allow smaller allied nations to participate in discussions on the German peace treaty.

[United Press Moscow, 13th] The four foreign ministers held their fourth meeting today, chaired by British Foreign Secretary Bevin. US Secretary of State Marshall proposed a suggestion requiring the Allied nations to adopt a unified policy on purging Nazis in Germany. He stated that the United States has now learned that the Soviet Union is not vetting Nazis who have joined the German Communist Socialist Unity Party. The US government is opposed to using the purge of Nazis as a political tool to support any German political party. British Foreign Secretary Bevin also echoed Marshall's position that the Allied nations must unify their policy on purging Nazis. Marshall also pointed out that Nazis in the American occupation zone are not allowed to participate in political party activities, while there are incidents of active Nazis in the Soviet occupation zone participating in the Socialist Unity Party. Marshall immediately requested that the Allied Control Council in Berlin be instructed to order the German authorities to unify laws to guarantee "equality and fairness" for the German people. Finally, Molotov and Bevin both agreed to this. However, Molotov replied that he was not aware of any incidents of Nazis being recruited into the Socialist Unity Party, but that the Soviet occupation zone had purged 390,470 people, while the purging work in other occupation zones was extremely poor. Molotov requested in the meeting that comprehensive labor unions be organized in Germany, regardless of occupation zone boundaries, and requested that the land reform plan that has already been implemented in the Soviet occupation zone also be implemented in the Western occupation zones. He said that after unifying the occupation zone governments, discussions on the future organization of the German government can avoid certain debates, such as the fact that the government currently organized in the American occupation zone is federal in nature, while the Soviet occupation zone is a centralized government. Based on impressions gained, Marshall and Bevin were unsuccessful in bringing general principles up for discussion. The fifth meeting tomorrow will continue to discuss the issue of purging Nazis.

### Churchill Praises Truman's Speech

[Reported by this newspaper] London, 14th Broadcast: Churchill delivered a speech at the Conservative Party meeting, praising President Truman's new foreign policy, saying: "Among the various steps taken by the United States to maintain world peace and freedom, I know of none so strong and powerful, giving more opportunities. If the United States had taken this step before the last world war, it could have prevented its occurrence. If this step had been taken after the First World War, it could have been prevented even more. If this step had been taken before 1914, world peace could have been maintained, and we all would have lived in a happier world. I am sure that public opinion in our country will welcome this great decision by the United States. This is our obligation. I dare say that our policy is like America's policy of friendship with the Soviet Union, but this is a strong policy of friendship, not a weak policy of appeasement."

### US House Appropriations Committee Opposes Shipping Oil Refining Equipment to USSR, Considering Such Action as Seeking Appeasement of the Soviet Union

[United Press Washington, 13th] House Appropriations Committee Chairman Taber today rejected the State Department's application to allow the shipment of $25 million worth of oil refining equipment to the Soviet Union. He said, "We cannot take this action. This action is tantamount to seeking to appease the Soviet Union." This equipment was originally intended to be shipped to the Soviet Union under the Lend-Lease agreement, but it was not implemented before the end of last year. In 1946, it was stipulated that the use of public funds for shipping would be prohibited from December 31. The State Department's request had already been rejected by the Senate Appropriations Committee.

### Izvestia Attacks

[Reported by this newspaper] San Francisco, 14th Broadcast: The Soviet government's official newspaper "Izvestia" today fiercely attacked Truman, saying that "Truman is the second Hitler, and his true purpose is to annex Greece and Turkey."

[United Press Moscow, 13th] The first reaction in the Soviet Union to President Truman's speech was to compare the United States with Germany during the era of Nazi territorial expansion. An editorial in "Izvestia" accused the United States of attempting to subject Greece and Turkey to its imperialist expansion plans. The newspaper mocked Truman's call to save Greece and Turkey from Bolshevism, saying it was not something new. "When Hitler wanted to open up his path of aggression, he also spoke madly of the Bolsheviks." This heated editorial appeared on the fifth day of the Foreign Ministers Conference, just as the Foreign Ministers Conference was deadlocked in a general debate on the German issue. Due to Truman's provocative speech and its broad implications, the entire future is bleak.

### Ambassador Koo's Speech: Hopes Democratic Countries will Cooperate to Jointly Guarantee Lasting Peace

[Agence France-Presse Charlottesville, Virginia, 14th] Chinese Ambassador to the United States Koo Vi-kyuin delivered a speech to students at the University of Virginia last night, saying that to guarantee lasting peace, the world's democratic countries must take united action, and there is no doubt that democracy will ultimately prevail. However, the immediate priority is to complete effective cooperation and successfully conclude agreements with enemy countries before it can be effective.

### Wallace's Views

[United Press New York, 13th] Former Secretary of Commerce Wallace gave a radio address today, commenting on President Truman's proposal to loan money to Greece and Turkey, believing that it would push the whole world closer to war. He said: "What we are encountering is not a Greek crisis, but an American crisis. As an American citizen, I oppose giving loans to Turkey, which is neither democratic nor food-sufficient. I oppose giving loans to Greece until a national Greek government is established and ensures that American loans are used for the welfare of the Greek people." Wallace believes that Truman's plan will worsen America's relations with the Soviet Union.

### Truman's Health Better Than Before, Reading Novels for Leisure

[Reported by this newspaper] San Francisco, 14th Broadcast: President Truman is resting in Key West, Florida. It rained suddenly today, so he stayed indoors, reading novels for leisure. According to White House Press Secretary Ross, "The President's health is better than before." Regarding the world's reaction to his speech, Mr. Truman has only heard a little about it, but his staff frequently communicates with Acheson at the State Department and Marshall in Moscow by telephone. It is said that Mr. Truman is ready to fly back to Washington at any time if necessary.

### Hong Kong Passes Budget

In his reply, the President said that China is a permanent member of the UN Security Council and is sufficient to promote world democracy and peace. Ambassador Wu told the press that China is currently discussing the purchase of 500,000 tons of Chilean nitrate and plans to purchase brass and other Chilean products.

### Compromise Plan on Japanese Reparations: It is Reported that MacArthur has Submitted it to Washington

[United Press Tokyo, 14th] According to semi-official sources today, MacArthur has submitted to Washington a compromise plan on Japanese reparations, with a total value approximately equal to the average of that stipulated in the Pauley Plan and that proposed by the visiting committee in February. It is said that if the current "temporary" reparations plan can be passed, the above-mentioned standard will be achieved. The source also said that Pauley's plan was too harsh and may not be feasible. Conversely, the committee organized by American engineers completely ignored the political significance of reparations. Experts at the Allied General Headquarters hope that this "temporary" plan will be approved by the Far Eastern Commission without further delay or modification. For the sake of Japan's economic recovery, MacArthur also hopes that it will proceed quickly. The plan was submitted to Washington two weeks ago.

A total of 31 warships have been dismantled in various ports in Japan, with the most dismantled in the port of Wu, which is under British occupation. The US military announced the dismantling of Japanese warships on the same day that the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference was waiting for Molotov to announce the dismantling of the German fleet he had received.

### Plane Returning from Guangzhou Crashes Over Zhabei: Flying Fortress Destroyed, Seven on Board Perish, Shantytown Collapses, Mother and Daughter Die Tragically

[Reported by this newspaper] A B-24 four-engine bomber (i.e., Flying Fortress) belonging to the Eighth Air Group stationed at the Datong Airport in this city crashed over Zhabei yesterday at 5:15 PM while flying back from Guangzhou. It was destroyed in Zhongshan Road and Tai Road, Yintang Residence, and caught fire. All seven people on board were air force personnel who died in the crash. At the same time, it also crushed a shantytown household, killing a mother and daughter inside.

The plane arrived near this city at around 4:30 PM yesterday, circling over Datong and Zhabei for several weeks, flying extremely low. At 5:15 PM, residents near the area suddenly heard a strange noise and saw the plane crash vertically from the sky, accidentally crushing a Guan family shantytown household, and immediately catching fire. Two people from the plane were thrown out. At that time, many policemen from the fourth squad of the 24th division were on the scene and rushed to rescue. They dragged one person out of the plane, but they were already dead. Subsequently, an explosion occurred in the plane, and machine gun bullets flew out. The Yichang and Zhabei fire brigades dispatched fire trucks to put out the fire, but because the gasoline was on fire, it was difficult to extinguish for a while. When reporters left at around 9:00 PM, there was still residual fire. The nose, wings, and body of the plane were fragmented, scattered all over the ground. Only the tail was intact, with the tail numbers 4424462 and B24002. Luggage, canned food, radio transceivers, machine guns, and other miscellaneous items were scattered around the plane's body.

The Guan family shantytown's head was Guan Yemao, who had two brothers, Yeqing and Yeliu, who were farmers from Yancheng. When the plane crashed, only Guan Yemao's wife and daughter Fahua were in the house. Because they could not escape in time, they were buried in the fire. Guan Yeliu and another resident, Guan Caigui, were injured by flying fragments from the plane and were sent to the Red Cross Hospital on Jiaozhou Road, Xinzha Road, by the fire police. It is understood that because the injuries were minor, they were discharged from the hospital late at night after bandaging. Liang Kanghou, the third section chief of the Eighth Air Group, visited Zhang Youquan, the director of the Datong Police Sub-bureau, to discuss the aftermath. Director Zhang agreed to send police officers to guard the accident site all night to prohibit the movement of any parts removed from the plane to investigate the cause of the accident. It is also learned that among the three bodies of the personnel on board that have been recovered, one is Qu Bingjun, 30 years old. The other surnames are unknown. (Attached pictures: The top picture shows the moment when the plane crashed and caught fire, taken by Jiekang. The bottom picture shows the situation when firefighters arrived to put out the fire, taken by this newspaper.)

### Gold Rush Kingpin Zhan Liansheng Escorted to Court for Brief Interrogation and Detained; Lin and Yang Continue to Work Under Surveillance

[Report from This Newspaper] Lin Fengbao, former Director of the Business Department of the Central Bank, and Yang Anren, former Deputy Director, colluded with Zhan Liansheng, Chairman of the Gold Trade Association, to manipulate prices by secretly selling gold for profits, causing the recent gold rush. After being investigated and reported by the Economic Supervisory Group to the highest authorities, the Songhu Garrison Headquarters, acting on behalf of Chairman Chiang's telegram numbered 60426, detained Lin Fengbao, Yang Anren, and Zhan Liansheng for investigation. It was believed that the defendants were suspected of violating Article 2, Section 6, and Article 3, Section 6 of the Regulations for the Punishment of Corruption. Except for Lin and Yang, who were released on bail the night before last, Zhan Liansheng was escorted to the Local Court at 5:10 p.m. yesterday as an accomplice in corruption. At 5:30 p.m., Judge Zai Zhuo of the Local Court opened the court for interrogation. According to Zhan's statement, he is 60 years old, from Suzhou, residing at No. 25, Lane 668, Beijing Road, serving as the manager of Tongfengyu Gold Shop and the chairman of the Gold Trade Association of this city. After the judge finished the interrogation, he was ordered to be detained.

According to Zhan Liansheng to reporters: There are many companies undertaking the Central Bank's sale of gold, how can I manipulate it alone? In a few days, the truth will come out. The local court has decided to form a collegial panel for the trial, and the court president has appointed Chief Judge Wu Xiangzu as the presiding judge.

Furthermore, Lin Fengbao and Yang Anren, after being released on bail the night before last, originally planned to go to Beijing by night train, but did not go due to other reasons. Yesterday, they still went to the Central Bank to work, and their movements were still under the surveillance of the Garrison Headquarters.

The crimes of Lin Fengbao, Yang Anren, and Zhan Liansheng are the same case. Therefore, although Lin and Yang were temporarily allowed to be released on bail to handle the handover, their case files have been transferred to the Local Court at the same time as Zhan Liansheng. It is reported that the evidence of the crime announced by the Garrison Headquarters is part of the evidence that the three criminals could not destroy. Those that may have been destroyed are still transferred to the court. During the investigation of the gold rush, the Economic Supervisory Group could only conduct a general investigation due to certain objective reasons. If further development is sought based on this outline, there are still many clues to be found. After the case is transferred to the court, this work will be done by the court.

### Retrial of Tang Shoumin, Ruddy Complexion and Calm Demeanor, Claiming to Have Been Forced to Serve in Puppet Positions, Providing Intelligence and Witnesses

[Report from This Newspaper] Tang Shoumin, a giant in Shanghai's financial circles during the enemy and puppet period, was accused of serving as the chairman of the "Business Association" and other puppet positions and suspected of being a traitor. The High Court sentenced him to life imprisonment on May 30 last year. Tang refused to accept the verdict and appealed to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court overturned the verdict and sent it back for retrial on September 21 last year. The case reopened for investigation at the High Court yesterday afternoon. Tang was wearing a deep blue silk cotton robe, with a ruddy complexion and calm demeanor. He argued: He was the general manager of the Bank of Communications before the war. When the War of Resistance against Japan broke out in 1937, he followed the government to Hankou and was later ordered to go to Hong Kong to reorganize the business of the Bank of Communications. After the fall of Hong Kong, he planned to escape back to Chongqing from Kowloon, but was unfortunately arrested by the enemy military police and escorted to Shanghai. Wang Jingwei wanted me to be the Minister of Industry and Commerce, but I refused. Because I originally worked at the Bank of Communications, in order to preserve the property of the bank, I took the position of Chairman of the Bank of Communications. After the victory, all the cash of the Bank of Communications was handed over, and not a single gold bar was moved. There is a certificate from the Bank of Communications to prove this. The Puppet Commercial Control Committee was convened by Zhou Fohai and Mei Shiping at a tea party for representatives from all walks of life in Shanghai, and the organization of the "Commercial Control Committee" was announced on the spot, and I was elected as the chairman. It was impossible to refuse under the circumstances at the time. During his tenure in the puppet position, the puppet government entrusted him to purchase more than 127,000 pieces of yarn, some of which were distributed to Shanghai citizens, one zhang and five chi per person, regardless of gender or age. The rest were stored in the treasury and handed over after the victory. In addition, he provided economic intelligence to the Central Government, which was forwarded by Yuan Liang. Zhang Ziqi, the current Deputy Mayor of Tianjin, and Dai Juesheng, an official of the Military Statistics Bureau, can all prove this. Regarding his service as a counselor of the Puppet Central Reserve Bank and a member of the Puppet National Economic Committee, he argued that they were all empty titles and he had never been there. Lawyers Lu Shidao and Jiang Rong stood up to defend him. The court ordered that further investigation was needed and adjourned the trial.

The following matters were resolved: (1) Most of the reversionary houses seized by the office are lane houses, mostly used by various agencies, social groups, schools, or civil servants. If they are all appraised and auctioned, there will be many disputes over the relocation of the original residents. In order to facilitate the realization, it is proposed that the original residents be given priority to purchase at market value first. If the original residents are able to purchase, they will be publicly auctioned. The proposal was approved in principle and submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and implementation. (2) Li Ze, a traitor, has no shares in the Guangdong Bank, only a nominal director. The 60,000 shares listed on the bank's shareholder list, totaling 6 million yuan in puppet currency, are hypothetical. How should the aforementioned shares be handled? It was resolved that they should still be seized. (3) How should the reversionary shares of Zhang Lupi and Ye Yaoxian and others in the Puppet Commercial Bank be handled? It was resolved to send personnel to review all the accounts before discussing them. (4) Chen Jueyuan applied for the return of the house forcedly pawned by Miao Bin, a traitor, and Wu Yifang, the president of Jinling College, provided a letter of certification. How should this be handled? It was resolved that Chen Jueyuan should still submit a clear deed and return the house after verifying the phase payment.

### Reader Consultation, Medical and Health

(1) Cyst Behind Ear

Zhou Ruyuan asked: When I was fifteen years old, I found a small tumor behind my ear. Now it has grown from the size of a soybean to the size of half a longan. A surgeon diagnosed it as a scrofulous tumor and operated on it in May, removing rotten meat and a tuft of rooted hair. After removal, it was flat, but it swelled up again as before after a few days. Later, I inserted a medicine thread every day and covered it with ointment. After more than two months, it still didn't close. I don't know what kind of disease it is and how to treat it?

[Dr. Zhang Zhongming replied] This kind of cyst will not grow back if it is completely removed during surgery. The wound should be disinfected to close.

(2) Generalized Edema

Wang Zhengzhong asked: My father is in his seventies and contracted a disease last year. When it occurs, his whole body swells and his skin turns yellow. The doctor called it yellow edema. Please tell me (1) Is this disease dangerous? (2) What medicine can cure it?

[Dr. Zhang Zhongming replied] Your father seems to be suffering from nephritis. A urine test must be done first, and then a treatment plan can be determined.

Scholarship Quota

(2) The scholarship quota is tentatively set at around 30, with the exact number depending on the number of applicants who meet excellent conditions and changes in the association's financial situation. If necessary, selection can be done in batches, sending people abroad in sequence. (3) The scholarship amount is tentatively set at US$4,000 per person, for the following purposes: (1) round-trip travel expenses from China to San Francisco: US$1,000; (2) living expenses in the United States: US$200 per month, totaling US$2,400; (3) travel expenses, health insurance, and contingency expenses in the United States: US$600.

Scope of Study

(4) The scope of study is limited to the following disciplines: (1) social sciences (including law and commerce); (2) natural sciences; (3) agricultural science; (4) engineering; (5) education and psychology (including home economics and physical education). (5) Scholarships should be awarded based on the following principles: (1) the applicant with the best qualifications within the designated academic fields should be selected; (2) priority should be given to applicants whose field of study is directly and significantly related to China's material or social construction; (3) priority should be given to applicants whose field of study has few opportunities for advanced study in domestic public or private institutions; (4) priority should be given to applicants whose field of study lacks advanced study equipment in China but has superior conditions in the United States. (6) The allocation of scholarship places among academic institutions should be based on the following principles: (1) institutions with a larger number of professors or senior researchers should have more opportunities to receive scholarship places; (2) institutions whose personnel have received many scholarships for advanced study from any institution in the past six years should have fewer opportunities to receive scholarship places under this measure; (3) due to the association's financial resources, special consideration should be given to the needs of private universities, independent colleges, and research institutions in the allocation of scholarship places.

Application Conditions

(7) Applicants must meet all of the following conditions: (1) full professors of public or private universities or independent colleges whose qualifications have been reviewed and approved by the Ministry of Education, or full professors who have not yet been reviewed, or senior researchers of research institutions who meet the qualifications of professors according to the standards of the Ministry of Education (associate professors of universities and independent colleges, and full or associate professors of vocational schools are not eligible for this measure); (2) having outstanding teaching or research achievements within the association's designated academic fields; (3) not having traveled to any foreign country for any reason in the past six years (excluding Hong Kong and Macau); (4) having a practical plan for advanced study that can make good use of the one year in the United States (one copy each in Chinese and English); (5) having sufficient English language skills to ensure the smooth implementation of the study plan in the United States; (6) having a certificate from an academic institution that the applicant will be rehired or initially hired after completing the study period and returning to China; (7) having passed a physical examination by a physician recognized by the association (the initial physical examination is conducted by the physician of the applicant's service institution; if there is no such physician, it is conducted by the physician of the local public health institution. The association may designate a physician for re-examination if necessary.); (8) being recommended by the supervisor of the applicant's service institution. Among applicants who meet all the above conditions, the winners will be selected based on the degree of excellence in items 2 and 4.

(8) Personnel who can apply for scholarships from other parts of the association or cooperating institutions (such as the American Bureau for Medical Aid to China, the Chinese Industrial Cooperatives, the Chinese Mass Education Movement, and the association's Child Welfare Committee) or members of the association's University Professor and Researcher Scholarship Committee are not eligible to apply. (9) If an applicant has family members who need their support and is willing to continue serving at the original institution after completing the study period and returning to China, and the original institution is also willing to rehire them, the supervisor of the service institution must state in writing in the recommendation letter: if the applicant is selected, their original position should have salary and allowances, which will be paid to their family as usual during their study abroad.

### Changchun Northern Youth Basketball Team Triumphs in Tianjin: Defeats China Textile Team 1 in First Game

[Our Newspaper Tianjin Shipping News] After the Changchun Northern Youth Basketball Team arrived in Tianjin, it began to meet with the Tianjin team on the 9th. At 3:30 p.m., it played against China Textile Team 1 at the Yaohua Gymnasium, with Li Youzhen and Yao Enhan as referees. The audience was quite enthusiastic. 松北 refugees received more than 900,000 yuan in relief funds on the first day. If the plan for the Beijing team to come to Tianjin can be realized, the harvest will be even more considerable. Therefore, the Northern Youth team can be said to have made a worthwhile trip.

China Textile Takes the Lead

After the silver whistle sounded, each team showed their skills. The Northern Youth athletes were mostly tall and strong, but because they were unfamiliar with the place and the lineup was a little disorganized, they were taken advantage of by China Team 1. China Textile team has national players Li Shaotang and Li Yaohui, Pang Yanlin, etc., and their morale is very high. They took the lead in the fierce battle, scoring and leading. The Northern Youth was not willing to show weakness, and Ma Qingpu also repeatedly scored, but because the morale was in chaos, only two of the ten free throw opportunities were scored, resulting in a failure in the first half with a score of 16-22.

Northern Youth Takes the Lead

After changing sides, the Northern Youth changed its strategy, which was quite effective. China Textile's offense and defense were balanced, and they always led by one goal. Although the Northern Youth once created a tie with 33 points, the defense was sometimes taken advantage of, and they fell behind again. The China Textile team was eager to win, and often committed fouls. Li Shaotang was even sent off the field. At this point, there were no generals in Sichuan, and the overall situation was gone. In the last six minutes, the Northern Youth went straight in, and the scores of Tian Fuhai and Xu Yongji increased sharply. Although China Textile had Pang and Li and others trying to turn the tide, time was up, and the second half ended with a regretful truce at 21-32. The overall result was 48-43, and the Northern Youth took the lead by five points. The second game against Tianjin Electric will still be held at Yaohua on the evening of the 10th.

### Minister of Economic Affairs Wang to Shanghai to Handle Current Price Issues: In addition to Yarn and Cloth and Coal Determined by Special Management Agencies, the Price Review Committee Will Be Expanded

[Our Newspaper Reports] Minister of Economic Affairs Wang Yunwu arrived in Shanghai last night by the Beijing-Shanghai train and arrived yesterday morning. According to Wang, he will stay in Shanghai for a considerable period. The main task is to deal with the current price issues based on the government's new economic plan. During his stay in Shanghai, he will consult with relevant parties separately in order to establish a standard price system for various major daily necessities. It has now been decided that the prices of various public and transportation utilities will not be increased. As for the amount of their losses, a subsidy system will be adopted. The principles of its implementation are currently under discussion.

Yesterday afternoon at 4:00 p.m., the 28th regular meeting of the Textile Control Committee was held in the City Hall conference room. Those present included Minister of Economic Affairs Wang Yunwu, Director of the Textile Control Committee Wu, Deputy Director Li, Committee Members Shu Yunchang, Yang Xiren, Wang Yangxian, Wu Weijing, Rong Hongyuan, Shao Yixin, Gu Xinghai, and Liu Wenteng, Wang Zijian, and others. The meeting adjourned at around 6:00 p.m.

At yesterday's meeting, Minister Wang first announced the government's intention to stabilize prices in the new economic plan. Wang continued: the review of the prices of various major commodities such as rice, yarn and cloth will be determined by the Textile Control Committee, and coal will be determined by the Fuel Control Committee. In addition, Shanghai will expand the organization of a price review committee. Major daily necessities, such as rice, flour, cooking oil, sugar, and salt, will be reviewed by the committee. All relevant parties will participate in this meeting. The various prices will be reviewed in accordance with the principles set by the new economic plan. The reviewed prices will be submitted to the Price Committee and the National Economic Commission for approval before implementation. Then the agenda was discussed, one was the issue of foreign cotton, and the other was the discussion of the purchase price in March. The foreign cotton issue has been partially resolved after discussion. Based on the statistics of the cotton inventory and operating spindles of various factories, it was believed that 368,000 bales of foreign cotton were needed this season. The foreign cotton quota for this season is US$10 million, which can only purchase 230,000 bales. If calculated at the current exchange rate, it is still not possible to purchase this amount. The deficit of 138,000 bales will be subsidized by the cotton shipped by UNRRA. UNRRA has already arrived with 30,000 bales, which will be used to offset it first. The remaining 100,000 bales are also about to arrive. Regarding the discussion of the purchase price in March, it was decided that the price negotiation sub-committee of the cotton spinning association in the six districts will conduct a preliminary review. After the price is negotiated, it will be submitted to the Textile Control Committee for approval at a special meeting next Monday, and then Minister Wang will take it to Nanjing for approval at the Price Committee meeting next Tuesday.

In the oil market, stores still had strong demand for raw oil. Barrelled raw oil rebounded by 10,000 yuan, and distilled raw oil also increased by 3,000 to 4,000 yuan. However, soybean oil showed little dynamism due to arrivals in Qingdao, Hankou, and Tianjin. Rapeseed oil and clear oil remained unaffected by gains or losses.

Soybeans trended weaker, with cylinder beans falling by a small 1,000 yuan, and red beans also dropping by 1,000 yuan. Sesame remained strong. Peanut kernels experienced weak demand from outside ports, with normal sales locally, leading to a gradual decline of 3,000 to 5,000 yuan. Corn saw minimal demand from northern ports, leading to desperate price cutting. Red sorghum continued to decline, falling by another 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. Broad beans remained in a state of fluctuation, while soybeans faced sluggish sales, showing a weakening trend.

### Rumors of Changes in the US Dollar Exchange Rate

[Reported by this newspaper] Yesterday, the market was rife with rumors that the Central Bank would change the US dollar exchange rate to 8,000 yuan, with some saying it would be 10,000 yuan. As soon as the rumors started, the prices of Chinese stocks began to fall. Other general commodity prices also trended downward. The general belief in the market was that the recent personnel changes at the Central Bank were to coordinate with the government's new economic plan, and that policy improvements were certain. Another rumor was that a large amount of legal tender would be withdrawn and no longer issued, so people were optimistic about the legal tender. This reporter immediately inquired with a responsible person at the Central Bank's Foreign Exchange Examination Department about the change in the exchange rate. They said that they had not heard of such a thing, and that everything would have to wait until Director-General Zhang returned to the bank before there would be any clues.

According to a certain observer, the exchange rate between China and the United States was revised not long ago. Given the current state of China's currency, it would be ideal to first seek long-term stability at a certain level. Repeated revisions, whether lengthening or shortening, are not appropriate. Therefore, they believe the government will not arbitrarily change the exchange rate.

### State-Run Enterprises to Be Returned to Private Management; Meeting to Be Held Tomorrow for Discussion

[Reported by this newspaper] The planning committee for the return of state-run enterprises to private management has previously held meetings. However, due to the reorganization of the central government, the meetings were delayed. It is now learned that the Vice Premier of the Executive Yuan, Weng Wenhao, has scheduled another meeting in this city on the 16th to further discuss the plan for returning enterprises to private management, so as to decide on implementation strategies.

### Sellers Dominate Chinese Stock Market; Secondary Popular Stocks and Miscellaneous Stocks Fall to Daily Limits

Chinese stocks continued their downward trend yesterday, but due to loose monetary conditions, there was considerable fluctuation in the middle. Large investors were automatically reducing their holdings in both long and short positions, and transaction volume decreased. Many secondary popular stocks and miscellaneous stocks fell to their daily limits.

Morning Opening

Stable. Di Yong spun cotton opened, with numbers 198, 185, 83, 68, 199, 129, and 226 all rising and once recovering to 3,200 yuan. Numbers 180, 155, 76, 235, 32, 179, 47, 224, 2, and 156 increased supply, and Di Yong spun cotton was forced down to 3,000 yuan. Numbers 97, 179, and 235 took the opportunity to buy in at low prices, rising to 3,080 yuan. Numbers 2, 171, 156, 197, 85, 14, 207, 152, 154, 16, and 205 sold off in unison, and Tongyi, Meyer, Datong, Yonggong, Cement, and Rongfeng all fell to their daily limits. The 3,000-yuan level was broken, and Di Yong spun cotton was forced down to 2,850 yuan. Numbers 180, 231, 14, 177, and 12, etc., made up the losses, and the market closed at 2,900 yuan outside of the midday closing. As a result, compared to the previous closing, Yong spun cotton and French shares each fell by half, while Xinyi, Meyer, Xinguang, Xinhua, Qinxing, and Jingfu each fell by 10% to 15%. Huafeng fell by slightly less than half. In after-hours trading, Yong spun cotton, Huafeng, and Xinguang each fell by half, while Xinyi and Meyer fell by 10%. Cold stocks Rongfeng, Yonggong, Xinya, Zhongfang, Cement, Tongyi, Datong, and Business were all forced to their limits. However, some stocks rebounded slightly after hitting their limits. Matches, Jinglun, Wuhe, and Lilian underwear were all close to their limits.

In the afternoon, numbers 180, 211, 186, and 4, as well as retail investors, all sold, while numbers 99, 32, and 218 were still taking in. Di Yong spun cotton retreated to 2,800 yuan. Numbers 141, 91, 152, and 231 bought in, recovering to slightly less than 2,900 yuan. At this time, Business, Meyer, Xinya, Tongyi, Guohuo, Yonggong, Rongfeng, and Zhongsi all fell to their limits, struggling considerably. Numbers 13, 87, 80, 180, and 152 continued to sell, retreating to 2,820 yuan. Numbers 76, 102, 226, and 180, 235, etc., repeatedly bought in. After 3 o'clock, due to an unimportant announcement in the market, rumors suddenly spread that special certificates had been cancelled, sparking a buying frenzy. Many blindly followed, driving Di Yong spun cotton up to around 2,950 yuan. Ultimately, this unfounded buying could not last. Numbers 71, 197, 117, 22, and 235 all came to supply, and the market closed again below 2,850 yuan. As a result, compared to the previous closing, Yong spun cotton, Meyer, Xinguang, and Jingfu each fell by slightly more than half, Xinhua and French shares each fell by slightly less than one and a half, Xinyi and Qinxing each fell by 10%, and Huafeng fell slightly. In after-hours trading, Yong spun cotton, Xinyi, Xinguang, and Meyer each fell by around 10%, and Huafeng fell by slightly more than half. Cold stocks, except for Jinglun, Wuhe, and Lilian falling by 10%, all fell to their limits. However, some rebounded slightly after hitting their limits. Outside the market, except for Dasheng seeing a decline, the remaining stocks continued to rise.

### Remittances from Overseas Chinese Through Postal Remittance Bureau Increase in Legal Tender Amount

According to Secretary Zhang of the Overseas Chinese Remittance Group of the Postal Remittance Bureau, the agencies handling remittances from Overseas Chinese in China include the Bank of China, the Postal Savings Bureau, the Overseas Chinese Bank, and the Guangdong Bank. The bureau's remittance business focuses on the United States and the South Seas Islands (including Singapore, Java, and over twenty other places). The remittance situation was good last autumn, but the high black market exchange rate in Hong Kong had a great impact on our remittance business. Remittances in January of this year amounted to 1.1 billion yuan in legal tender (of which 200 million yuan was from the United States, and the rest was from the South Seas Islands, with the most remittances coming from Kuala Lumpur, Ipoh, Penang, and three other cities). Since the recent announcement of emergency economic measures and the adjustment of foreign exchange rates, remittances from Overseas Chinese through the bureau to the motherland have reached a total of 1.4 billion yuan in legal tender as of last week.

### Rayon Prices Decline

Rayon continued to decline due to a complete lack of actual sales. Yesterday, the market fell by another 200,000 yuan. Number 120, Gaoshan Youguang, opened weakly, calling for 450,000 yuan, but no one inquired. The market closed at 400,000 yuan without any transactions. In the afternoon, the price remained between 350,000 and 400,000 yuan. Factory agents also saw no transactions yesterday, with asking prices slightly lower than the previous day. Some were willing to sell D-grade user silk for 7.2 million yuan, but there were no buyers. Silk fabrics generally did not change their asking prices. Although raw materials had fallen, factory prices were insufficient to cover costs, so they all held firm, and transactions were extremely rare.

### Cotton Textile Association of Six Districts to Review Purchase Prices

[Reported by this newspaper] The price negotiation subcommittee of the Cotton Textile Association of Six Districts is scheduled to hold a meeting at 10 a.m. today at the conference room of the Textile Construction Company on Jiangxi Road. Members of the association, including Wu Weijing, Tong Runfu, Liu Jingji, Chen Jintang, and Jiang Dixian, will all attend. In addition to reviewing the purchase price for March, the factory price for free trade of private factories will also be reviewed, and the maximum price will be stipulated. At the same time, the committee will discuss whether to supplement the purchase price for February.

Regarding the 40 million US dollars in foreign exchange required for the foreign cotton quota, negotiations will be conducted for prompt approval after President Zhang of the Central Bank returns to Shanghai from Beijing today.

### Fine Cloth Asking Prices Increase

Yesterday, the cotton cloth market saw limited supply of fine cloth from the Textile Construction Company, while dyeing factories continued to demand it, leading to depletion of spot chips. Market sentiment was positive, and asking prices increased. 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth prices rose to 160,000 yuan, an increase of 1,500 yuan from the previous day. Blue Chicken was 146,000 yuan, up 2,000 yuan. Zhenzhong was 135,000 yuan, up 5,000 yuan. Other brands also increased by 1,000 to 2,000 yuan. For raw-colored cloth and drill, demand from native merchants was quite strong due to the upcoming milder weather, leading to more brisk prices. Customers from Tianjin made large purchases. Four Gentlemen Golden Seal drill initially opened at 149,500 yuan, gradually rising to 152,000 yuan, an increase of 4,000 yuan. 405 Sheep fine twill was 137,500 yuan, up 7,500 yuan. Other goods were also firm.

### Continued Allocation of Cooking Oil for the Third Week: 250,000 Yuan per Shih

[Reported by this newspaper] The Shanghai Cooking Oil Joint Allocation Office continued the allocation of cooking oil for the third week starting yesterday, totaling 3,000 dan (担, a unit of weight) of soybean oil and 600 zu (祖, a unit of measurement) of rapeseed oil. The allocated area is south of the Suzhou River (including Nanshi and Huxi, with "Zhong", "Xi", and "Nan" on the allocation certificates). The payment dates are the 14th and 15th, from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. each day. The allocation quantity is one barrel (360 shih jin, 市斤, a unit of weight) per household. Households can choose either soybean oil or rapeseed oil, and the price remains 250,000 yuan per shih.

### Large Batch of Flour Arrives at Port

[Reported by this newspaper] The "Torifiqi" (transliteration), manager of the overseas department of Jardine Matheson, brought in over 264,000 bags of flour from Vancouver, as well as 140 large pine logs and dry wood pulp. The ship is currently unloading at buoys No. 1 and No. 2. These goods were purchased by the Central Trust Bureau. In addition, the "Smola Victory" of the Great American Company also arrived yesterday, carrying 1,600 tons of goods, as well as 1,700 bales of cotton and miscellaneous goods, totaling about 7,000 tons.

### Hankou Tung Oil Floods In; 400 Tons Arrived at the Wharf Yesterday

[Reported by this newspaper] Tung oil from Hankou has been continuously arriving for the past two weeks, with a total of approximately 2,800 tons having arrived. Yesterday (the 14th), 400 tons arrived and were being unloaded at the wharf. The purchase price for merchants in Shanghai yesterday was 390,000 yuan per dan for standard oil, and 420,000 yuan per dan for retail. The export price for standard oil was 430,000 yuan, and 440,000 yuan with the barrel. The price of "Fu Xi Hong" (a brand of tung oil) was 370,000 yuan per barrel. It is estimated that the large quantity of tung oil arriving from various sources is due to the attraction of high prices. Yesterday, the price of standard Hankou tung oil was 370,000 yuan per shih.

### Woolen Fabric Spring Sales Launch

Yesterday, large and small Western-style tailors and retail shops in this district, as well as customers from Hunan, North China, Hankou, Anqing, Xuzhou, Nanjing, Hangzhou, etc., all eagerly purchased woolen fabrics. The spring sales were launched, and buyers' appetite was strong. Yuan Changxing and other shops were crowded. In addition to light-colored goods selling well, palice, wandaline, feather yarn, and Xia cloth were also sold in large quantities. Other items such as lining cloths, mercerized feather yarn, French lining, sleeve linings, foreign cloth, gray soft lining, rainproof cloth, white canvas, and hemp glue cloth also saw brisk transactions.

### Northeastern Soybeans Arrive in Shanghai; 60 British Pounds per Ton

According to sources in the import and export industry, Northeastern soybeans have always been one of China's important export commodities. The United Kingdom and other European countries have strong demand. It is learned that import and export firms here have already shipped goods to the port, with a selling price of 60 British pounds per ton, delivered on board in Shanghai. Based on current market prices, this seems quite profitable.

### This Year's Export Oil Quantities: Economic Department Allocation Finalized; Soybean Oil to Soviet Union Most, Tung Oil to United States Most

The quantity of oil exports for this year has been finalized by the Ministry of Economic Affairs according to the needs of various countries. The total export volume is 141,400 metric tons, of which (1) soybean oil accounts for 90,000 metric tons, with the Soviet Union having the largest allocation of 30,000 metric tons, followed by Japan with 14,000 metric tons, the United Nations with 7,500 metric tons, and other countries with a total of 38,500 metric tons. (2) Tung oil accounts for 39,400 metric tons, with the United States having the largest allocation of 10,000 metric tons, followed by the United Nations with 7,000 metric tons, France with 3,000 metric tons, and other countries with a total of 19,400 metric tons. (3) Peanut oil accounts for 1,000 metric tons, with only Canada needing it. (4) Rapeseed oil accounts for 11,000 metric tons, equally allocated among Canada and ten other countries.

### Export Promotion Committee Subcommittee Meetings to Be Established Soon

[Reported by this newspaper] According to Mr. Shen Xirui, Director of the Secretariat of the Export Promotion Committee, the future work direction of the Export Promotion Committee must wait until President Zhang returns to Shanghai before any decisions can be made. Of the 17 subcommittee meetings of the committee, three have already been established, and another three or four are planned to be established soon. The urgent export of straw hat braids aims to provide employment opportunities for straw hat braid producers in Wenzhou. The current election of 34 representatives by foreign merchants is unrelated to the Export Promotion Committee, and the method of future liaison with our committee still needs to be discussed.

### Qihong Tea Market Slightly Weak

Yesterday, although sellers' asking prices for red-edged tea specifically for domestic sales once increased, the market's strength ultimately remained unable to rise due to sluggish sales and continued to hover. Foreign firms continued to suppress the price of Qidou black tea, with transactions continuing to occur, mainly because those urgently seeking funds continued to sell. Although prices did not fall continuously, the situation generally softened. According to buyers, if sellers are willing to make further concessions, there will be more willingness to absorb the tea. As for various green teas, old and inferior goods that have been stored for many years remain difficult to sell. However, there is a constant stream of inquiries about the colors and varieties of 1945 and 1946. Unfortunately, the results of the discussion and negotiation between buyers and sellers lack smoothness, and the process is difficult to turn into a splendid situation, with the situation remaining firm as before.

### Tianjin Merchants Demand Yarn; Yarn Market Continues to Thrive

Yesterday, the yarn market continued to thrive, because Tianjin merchants still had a demand, and peers took advantage of the situation to buy, causing the prices of various counts of yarn to rise by another 100,000 yuan. 40-count single yarn was still in demand by weaving factories, and 42-count double-strand thread rose by 250,000 yuan. Although the prices of other counts followed suit and rose by 100,000 yuan, there were only asking prices, and buyers were still extremely scarce, making the foundation unstable.

### China Textile Construction Company Sells Yarn

[Reported by this newspaper] Yesterday, the China Textile Construction Company sold yarn on behalf of the Textile Control Commission as usual, selling a total of 2,312 pieces. Domestic manufacturers accounted for 1,958 pieces, and yarn numbers accounted for 354 pieces. A total of 1,102 households applied, of which 757 were domestic manufacturers and 345 were yarn numbers.

### Reclassification of Import Tariffs Definitely Being Studied by Special Subcommittee

[Reported by this newspaper] Yesterday, this reporter visited a responsible person at the quota allocation office of the Import and Export Control Committee and asked many questions, which they answered. They are recorded as follows: (1) Due to repeated requests from various parties to reclassify certain import tariffs, they have indeed been submitted to a special subcommittee to study the method of reclassification to meet the needs of reality. However, it is still awaiting submission to the authorities for approval before it can be published. (2) The qualification verification of importers of gasoline, diesel, etc., is based on 35% of each merchant's turnover in the three years before the war, 35% of the turnover in the one year after the war (1946), and 30% of each merchant's operating capacity, oil storage capacity, etc. Other imported goods each have their own standards, and they are not all the same. The allocation matters for oil merchants will be decided at another meeting today, and it will be completed. (3) The foreign cotton quota will not change. However, the allocation method may be considered for modification. (4) According to the situation before the war, the annual import volume of the goods listed in Appendix 2 accounted for 70% of the total import value of our country, and the current situation is similar. (5) The monthly allocation quota for newsprint is roughly 1,000 tons for newspapers in this city, 600 tons for newspapers in other cities, 550 tons for local party newspapers, and 1,500 tons for the book industry.

Spring and Autumn

### On "Devil" and "Tao"

— Ge Zhe Wu

Also Discussing "The Coffin Split Open," "Journey to the West," and "Pan Jinlian," etc.

"The Tao rises one foot, the devil rises ten," is the theoretical rule of Chinese orthodox thought. Therefore, what is called "Tao," we certainly know is "self-denial and restoration of propriety," but it is the result of "asceticism"! This result is naturally the opposite of "Tao" to the true nature of "humanity"! Because Tao also means rules and regulations, the manifestation and norm of human power, not the destination of free desire. It can become a correct theory in politics, but it is a subject worth resisting in artistic expression! The two major centers of artistic expression are sex and food! The sage also said, "Eating and sex are human nature." It can be seen that the highest expression of art is nothing more than the problem of love and bread!

Since love is one aspect of human nature, artistic expression often cannot escape this category. There have been many works throughout history, both ancient and modern, both Chinese and foreign, that take the entanglement and struggle between the desired "Tao" and "human nature" as their theme!

For example, I recently watched "The Coffin Split Open," which I had seen in my childhood. Orthodox theorists call it yellow culture, but after careful investigation, the theme of the play is nothing more than another expression of the theme of "Tao" and "Devil"! For example, Zhuang Zhou designed to test his wife, which is the foothold of "Tao" at work. And when Zhuang Zhou told her about "fanning the grave," his wife scolded him for being shameless, and said that she would never do such a thing in the future, which is another foothold of "Tao"! That is the norm of artificial society, not the desire of human nature itself! So later, Zhuang Zhou transformed into a young master to mourn. If it wasn't for the temptation of a handsome young man, if it were a pockmarked man or a blind man, she might not have been moved by his beauty! And the young master wanted to eat "human brains," a desire that was unreasonable. The woman initially did not seem to bear to do it, but the magic of the young master's cries aroused an all-consuming action. This is possible under the explanation of "sexual perversion psychology," which is the manifestation of "Devil" power overwhelming "Tao" practice! The writer of this play certainly intended to write about "the exploration of a woman's lust," but he did not fail to harbor the thought of resisting the one-sided chastity of "widowhood." It is a pity that he wrote it a little too viciously!

In the past, Mr. Ouyang Yuqian wrote "Pan Jinlian" to overturn the old case. He believed that Pan's love for Ximen Qing was the result of the perversion of not being able to love Wu Song. Today, Zui Lijun's long monologue at the end of "Wu Song" is the main line of the drama "Pan Jinlian" of that year. At that time, Mr. Hong Shen had judged it with the theory of abnormal psychology, and Ying praised Mr. Ouyang's "bold" work. In fact, in so-called demonic works of literature, the coloring of this kind of human nature is everywhere! "Salome" wanted to kiss the saint but could not, and as a result, she wanted the saint's "head." This is also the struggle between the devil and the tao, and it is also the satisfaction of sexual perversion psychology!

Similarly, in "Journey to the West," every monster wants to eat Tang Monk's flesh! This is also the struggle between the saint and the demon. The only difference is that each time Tang Monk encounters difficulties, he remains loyal, guards himself, and his Tao heart does not move, and finally he is saved! This kind of "emptiness" and "lust" is the theme of the Chinese "Legend of the White Snake"! In Japan, there is a play called "The Robber," which tells the story of a thief being deceived by a woman and finally arrested, and it also has the same meaning of "devil" overcoming "sincerity"!

As for another play called "Emptiness" and "Lust," the content is about a "high monk" who, after twenty years of Taoist cultivation, meets his mistress of twenty years on a journey. He tried his best to restrain himself, but he was finally made drunk by the woman, and his twenty years of Taoist practice were all abandoned! This is also a product of writing about the power of the devil overcoming the practice of Tao!

In short, the struggle between the devil and the tao often becomes a major theme in literature. As for whether the victory is written about the tao or the victory is written about the devil, there are different views. However, I believe that there is no sin in writing about direct love literature, but if it is rendered too fiery and promiscuous on the stage, it should not be allowed by "Tao," which is also the downward path of "humanity." Flowing into the river of depression and numbness is not what the future of mankind needs. Roughly speaking, the "yellow" of "yellow" culture refers to this meaning; however, as far as literature and art are concerned, it has its own "moral view," so there is no need to measure it with ordinary vulgar theories!

### Two Sides of Perfection

— Hu Shanyuan

Mencius said, "Fish is what I desire; bear's paw is also what I desire. If I cannot have both, I will forgo the fish." Achieving both is indeed a difficult thing.

To write well and to be popular with readers is perhaps the same as trying to have both fish and bear's paw. Because anyone can understand: a good article may not be popular, and a popular article may not be good; although a good article can be popular, and a popular article can be good, these are ultimately rare exceptions. First, is there any absolute, objective standard of good writing? No. So, good writing itself has no reliable basis. Second, in today's world where "writing is valued by the person," there is even less of a standard for good writing. Often, what famous writers produce, even if it's just incoherent accounts, is treated as a masterpiece, while the carefully crafted works of the unknown rarely get published, lacking even the most basic luck. Therefore, what is called good writing may be bad writing! Whether an article is popular has nothing to do with its quality. The quality of writing and its popularity are two entirely separate matters, just as fish is fish and bear's paw is bear's paw.

If you understand this point, that writing cannot be perfect in both aspects, you can save yourself a lot of trouble. Anyone can set a goal and work towards it to achieve their wish. For example, if you only want to write well and don't care about popularity, then you will write according to your conscience and ability, creating what you believe is the best article, in both content and form, and it will be appreciated by the few who truly have the eye and know its worth. If you only want to be popular, then, to be honest, you don't need to worry about the quality of the article at all, and you don't need to take the difficult and unrewarding path of insisting on good writing. Just find a way to attract the reader's attention and win their favor, and you can succeed. In this way, everyone gets what they want: those who want good writing get good writing, and those who want popularity get popularity. Perhaps this is a true kind of two-sided perfection.

Only when things are divided into two can we talk about two-sided perfection. Combining things into one, trying to have it all, makes two-sided perfection impossible. This is what we should clearly understand.

Unfortunately, there are many who don't understand this principle and still desperately try to have both, ending up "like a hunchback falling, landing on neither end" and creating a lot of trouble. For example: thinking their own writing is good, they initially believe it will definitely be popular. When the result is not so, they try hard to find the reason. The result of their research will inevitably lead to two paths: one, to change direction, no longer being true to the writing itself, but only seeking popularity. Because they are not used to being popular, popularity remains unattainable, and their writing deteriorates; two, they inevitably blame heaven and earth, thinking that writing is ill-fated and has no way out. As for articles that were originally popular, if they suddenly try to improve and write something truly good, the result will also be a loss of popularity, and like a maidservant imitating a mistress, they end up being neither one thing nor the other, worthless, and feeling inevitably frustrated.

Unfortunately, there are still many who don't understand this principle and are desperately flattering others: seeing someone else's good writing, they say it will definitely become popular and sought after. The author, hearing this, is initially flattered and overjoyed. After a while, unless they have realized that they cannot have both, they will either change their principles and drift with the world, or they will be full of complaints and sadness, becoming a disappointed and sorrowful person. Or, seeing someone's article is popular, they say it is definitely a masterpiece, which is why it has such success, not realizing that they have drawn a line in the dark, pushing that author out of the literary heaven, making it impossible for them to ever return. To be honest, I am not willing to flatter people in this way, to deceive people. I want to say: your writing is good, but it may not be popular; or: your popularity is a fact, but your writing may not be good. In short, you cannot have both.

I say this not to be extreme, deliberately speaking against the grain, or striking a high note. There are many things in this world that cannot be perfect in both aspects, not just writing, let alone fish and bear's paw!

The Bible says, "It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God." This is the same principle. Otherwise, with one hand holding a wish-granting object and the other holding an abacus, those with cunning could greatly profit, gaining both fame and wealth, while those who are law-abiding and truly skilled would all be infuriated to death!…

Enough rambling, let's get back to writing. You should first recognize the principle that you cannot have both, and then decide which path you will take when you cannot have both! Once you have decided, go forward bravely and diligently, without regretting it. I wish you success!

### Reading "Remembering Sun Fulao"

— Xuan Jianren

Reading Mr. Chunqiu Lumang's article "Remembering Sun Fulao" on March 1st is exactly when I am missing Sun Fulao. I often miss this kind old man. Fulao's spirit is still like that of a young man in his twenties, without any "old-fashionedness," unlike the current young writers who claim to be "old writers" to sell their age.

Since Sun Fulao went to Chengdu Qilu University to teach, I haven't seen him for more than half a year. Every time I went to the Sino-Foreign Publishing House on Meizhuan School Street, Shangqingsi, I went with a belly full of happiness, and always came back with disappointment. At that time, I lived in Jiangbei, and it was quite troublesome to go to the city, but every time I asked the gentleman at the publishing house, he always seemed to be joking with me:

"He just went to Chengdu yesterday!"

Or:

"He hasn't come yet!"

When I pressed him, he would say, "Come and see in a few days!" In the end, I was never able to meet him.

Last summer, I saw a news item in the Xinmin Evening News (Chongqing edition), knowing that Fulao had come to Chongqing from Chengdu, and I went to visit him in the city again the next day. That day, I went especially early. After shaking hands, Fulao said with a smile:

"How did you know I was coming?"

I told him that I had seen the news in the newspaper, and also told him that I had come more than five times, but never met him. That noon, we drank old wine and ate noodles in a restaurant on Meizhuan School Street. Later, I also told him that I would be returning east and that I was afraid it would be difficult to find a job, and that the cost of living in Shanghai was too high, and I was afraid I couldn't bear it. Fulao immediately picked up a pen, without the slightest reluctance, and wrote a letter of introduction for me to visit an authoritative literary journal editor in Shanghai. Fulao said:

"He will definitely find a way for you."

After returning east, due to economic pressure, I stayed in Shanghai for two days and returned to my hometown. To this day, Fulao's letter of introduction is still in my suitcase.

"I also hope that Fulao will do more research on Lu Xun, and introduce him to the youth of the new era with correct insights." I believe that Fulao is the one who has the most thorough understanding of Lu Xun.

Fulao likes to smoke, drink, and taste tea. He says:

"Without cigarettes, alcohol, and tea, you can't write an article; with cigarettes, alcohol, and tea, you may not be able to write an article."

I know that Fulao loves to eat "stir-fried eel paste" the most. Almost every time we eat, we have this dish.

When Fulao was editing the supplement of the Central Daily News in Hualongqiao, he went almost every day to the shop called "Qingyu Restaurant" on Hualongqiao Street to eat noodles, drink wine, and eat dishes. The sign of that shop was also written by Fulao. He said:

"This boss is a very good typical character and can be written into a novel."

I still can't write it to this day. At that time, I only felt that the boss's flattering energy was unbearable.

Sometimes I asked Fulao about his experience as the magistrate of Hengshan County. He smiled and said, "Not interesting."

"I still hope that Fulao will come out of the mountains and work for literature and art, and for the youth." Fulao said that he could return east in the spring! I hope that Fulao can return east in the spring, and still appear as a cultural warrior, giving up the life of teaching. Although I am too selfish. (February Hefei)

### The Secret of Love

— RBurns Translated by Tianqin

I never told my love,

Love that never told can be;

For the gentle wind does move

Silently, invisibly.

I told my love, I told my love,

I told her all my heart

Trembling, cold, in ghastly fears.

Ah! She did depart!

Soon after she was gone from me,

A traveller came along,

Silently, invisibly:

He took her with a song.

### One Inch of River, One Inch of Blood 198

— Ye Jingfeng

"Roar...!" The fake "Commander Jin" indicated that she had figured things out, "So you two are here... really here...! Sorry, we can talk...!" After saying "sorry," she immediately turned around and yelled loudly at one of the two dung beetles behind her: "Send someone to tell the captain that this building is our own people, and all subordinates should resist in three routes to maintain contact with Chejiaomin Lane... Hurry up!"

One of these dung beetles was an unusually clever fellow. He had seen with his own eyes that the scout just now had plunged like a dog eating shit and fallen so hard that he had struggled to get up, making himself look bad in front of so many people and losing a lot of the prestige of the "Great Japanese Imperial Army"; so, as soon as he received the order, he immediately raised his hand in a salute, indicating "Order received," and then gently shook his dung beetle body to test the extent to which the floor was shaking; seeing that it was too slippery, he then raised his arms like someone walking a tightrope in a circus, lifted his feet, and first took a step forward in a heron-walking style. Only after this foot was firmly planted on the floor did he follow with the other foot, and his body followed suit, making a big turn in front of his direct superior, before walking out step by step. In this way, he believed that he had preserved his face by not falling down. But he did not realize that such movements, from the perspective of others, inevitably made them suspect that "this guy probably has a problem, and not a small one."

"So you two are here," the fake Kawashima Yoshiko said softly to Pingzi and Tsurumi again, "If I had known it was such a scene, I shouldn't have been so rash... Fortunately, my task is on the one hand to search for "unstable elements," and on the other hand to implement "protection" of our own people..."

"Very kind of you!" Tsurumi coldly interjected, resuming his standard Tokyo accent, and even gave a bow. "Being protected while protecting people, ha, that's very interesting."

"I hope that you only protect your own people!" The fake's face was covered with a dark sneer.

"Okay, okay!" Pingzi was still smiling, seemingly trying to smooth things over and bring the two sides together. "Let's not mention "protection," we are all here on orders, and we must take the overall situation into account!"

"The source of the orders is different, right!" Mizi's face was even darker, "But I must ask you a question... This building, I hear, is very complicated. Are you two responsible for guaranteeing that there are no lurking enemy agents? If you are responsible, I can go back immediately and report according to your wishes. If you cannot be responsible, it is best to let me carry out the inspection!"

These two sentences were no different from a double slap in the face, one on each cheek of Tsurumi and Pingzi, hitting them right on the ear. Pingzi has a gentle temperament, so perhaps he would not get angry. But Tsurumi is naturally a bit irritable, and I am very worried that he will not be able to hold back and will explode.

"Miss Inoue is right," Tsurumi seemed to be able to hold back his anger, "We will not talk about being responsible for the time being. The reason is very simple, because I do not have to be responsible to Miss Inoue, nor can I be responsible to your superior Miss Kawashima Yoshiko, and even less do I have to be responsible to your department chief, Director Doihara..."

### Dream

— Qingguo

"Dream," and "happiness," who can explain them?

In the dark night, you can sleep peacefully and dream peacefully.

In dreams, there is another world. Many people, many generations, grow there, enjoy themselves there, and die there.

But if you light a lamp to look at the people lying down and dreaming, you can see them smiling, crying, speaking, and singing... but you should understand that the people dreaming will not know.

People dreaming may be happy.

But I hope that one day the people dreaming can truly wake up, and in the bright light, realize how they are lying on a bed in a small room, and realize that in the cold corners, there are murmurs echoing, which they themselves do not understand, coming from their dreams.

### Tian Shou's Assorted Morsels

— Hei Yun

Mr. Tian Shou's fiftieth birthday should be a major event in the literary, drama, and film circles, because Mr. Tian himself is a history of innovation in Chinese drama, starting from the "Southern Society" until he engaged in various local operas and Peking opera reform movements, which has indeed marked a glorious historical moment in the Chinese drama circles for decades!

Because the birthday star has extensive social connections, people from all aspects are celebrating his birthday, which is worthy of being a grand gathering of the literary, drama, and film circles in the 36th year.

Many people who are usually not easy to meet also met here today; many friends who have not seen each other for more than ten years also shook hands and talked happily here today.

The auditorium of the Ningbo Fellow Association is not large, so it is particularly crowded. Especially at the entrance, it is really shoulder to shoulder, and there is no room to move.

Everyone's chest is adorned with a red silk ribbon that says "Tian Shou," because everyone is beaming with joy, so everyone has the style of drinking wedding wine.

Let me give you a description of several figures:

"Birthday Star" Tian Han, wearing a French beret and a long gown, sat properly in the first three rows, sometimes being pulled onto the stage, and sometimes wanting to run off the stage. Once, as he was about to come down, he was grabbed by Hong Shen and pulled back. Everyone burst into laughter. Someone whispered offstage:

"The birthday star is still shy!"

Hong Shen hosted the birthday celebration program on stage, talking and laughing, and giving a simple introduction to each program.

The figures who gave birthday speeches were various and varied, and each person who came on stage was very interesting. For example, Ye Shengtao read a birthday poem in his local dialect, saying again and again that he could not speak Mandarin.

Mei Lanfang was gentle and well-behaved like a good woman, quietly speaking in front of the microphone; while Guo Moruo was like "spring thunder" flashing with lightning, and every sentence was met with applause from the audience. Mr. Pan Gongzhan's speech was also a good speech. Zhou Xinfang's speech, at its climax, was full of the style of the Qilin School.

Under the stage, there were as many film and drama people, famous directors, university professors, and newspaper reporters as carps crossing the river. Let me try to write about a few figures: Shu Xiu'ai, who was preparing to go on stage to participate in the "Seven Women in the Storm" recitation program, was wearing a milky yellow scarf and chatting with friends on the aisle; Bai Yang was dressed in a gray coat, dressed in spring attire; Zhang Ruifang and Cao Yu, who had just returned from the United States, squeezed back and forth; Jin Suqin and Jin Suwen sat in the very back row, remembering that Jin Suqin had once performed the improved Peking opera "The Peach Blossom Fan," etc., but now she looked much more haggard. Jin Yan had something growing on his eyes and was with Wu Yonggang and others, Zheng Junli and Huang Chen were hiding in the corners; Jin Shan and Zhao Dan, who were the young actors of that year, were now in different situations. Jin Shan seemed much fatter, while Zhao Dan still had the graceful style of the handsome university professor in "Distant Love."

Ying Yunwei was standing in the corner talking and laughing with people, this old man seemed to have lost his teeth, Tang Huaiqiu was holding a coat, preparing to recite "Suzhou Night Talk." When this play was performed in the South City that year, it brought away so many people's tears.

There were many programs on stage, the drama won full applause, and the laughter was endless. After the local operas, there were many wonderful performances.

Cheng Yanqiu and Yuan Xuefen were waiting to go on stage to give their congratulations. In the evening, at the Huibin Building, all the guests and Tian Shou Xing were preparing to drink themselves into a drunken stupor.

### Old Tune—Replayed

— Xueyi

One winter evening, my sister and I were sitting in front of the fireplace reading a love letter sent by my boyfriend. At this time, my father was buried in reading the newspaper, but in the end, he couldn't help it and scolded loudly, "May God save us from these unbearable sounds." When my mother heard this, she silently put down the woolen pants she was knitting and motioned for us to go out with her. When we returned to the room, our old father was constantly cursing those young lads. We couldn't help but tell him, "Dad, you haven't heard the worst yet, let us read it to you!" So my sister continued to read. It was a letter full of passion and seemed to make people feel gentle and rippling. But before she finished reading, my father shouted angrily, "No, no, I have never heard such a cheesy thing, I forbid you to reply to this letter." We ignored him, let him scold for a while, but we were secretly laughing, because when we showed him the letter, we realized that this letter was the love letter that our father himself sent to our mother on January 1, 1915. (Translated from the February 1947 Reader's Digest "Love's Old Sweet Song")

### Taiwanese Bamboo Branch Poems

— Chi Fu

Taiwanese folk literature should have its value in literature. In his early years, Mr. Liang Qichao, and Mr. Li Shuzhang, a contemporary of Taiwan, collected many of them. Taiwanese bamboo branch poems are popular lyrics among Taiwanese men and women. Translating their meanings, they are as sad as the complaints of "Gu Feng" and "Xiao Bian," which are enough to show the sorrow of the loyalists of the past half-century. Now, I have selected and organized the collections of Mr. Liang as follows:

(1) The man's family lives in Sanchongpu, and the woman's family lives in Baishihu; the roads face each other only a few steps away, will the man try to turn around and see if the woman is there?

(2) The chive flowers bloom with a branch, when the flower is yellow, the leaves are fat; I wish the man would pick the flowers and leaves together, and I will never leave his heart until death.

(3) Talking about love under the acacia tree, loving the man and hating the man, but the man does not know, the acacia seeds are formed on the treetop, is it when the man is traveling and thinking of the woman?

(4) Holding a firewood knife into the firewood mountain, the heart of the firewood is not broken, but the firewood is climbed, the man is easily unfeeling, when will the firewood branches return to the tree?

(5) The man beats the big drum and the woman beats the gong, bowing to the Mazu goddess in the west of the sky; this life is enough to suffer from lovesickness, beg for no torment in the next life.

(6) Beating betel nuts in the green shade, dipping them in betel leaves to persuade the man; I wish the man would find it astringent in his mouth, and taste the bitterness and sweetness carefully.

(7) The taro grass flower blooms straight like a brush, the parasol trees are neatly tailed, and the sun shines to the west, the man is like a sunflower in the dew, and the woman is like a leaf that stands out in the wind.

(8) Teaching the man to come early, but the man is late, teaching the man to take big steps, but the man is slow, I thought to wait for the man for ten years, but my heart is sad before five years are over.

(9) The banana leaves are long and hard to cover the sun, the sugarcane flowers are good but cannot withstand the frost; the fat bananas are eaten by someone when they are old, I want to send them to the man, but I am worried about the long road.

(10) The man gave the woman a poinsettia, and the woman gave the man an orchid, the red blood tears will eventually run out, and the butterfly wings hang low so that the man can dry them.

### Lan Ma and Shangguan Yunzhu in "Paradise Dream"

### The Use of a Scholar

— Lei Ke

When I was studying in middle school, a teacher once told us that every object has different aspects, and a person's perception of the form of an object differs from others depending on their position. For example, if I stand at the back door of a house, I only see garbage all over the ground; another person stands at the front door of that house, and his impression is of a deeply locked gate; a third person goes inside, and his description is of carved beams and painted rafters. Another person enters in the middle of the night and feels that it is gloomy. In fact, the so-called garbage all over the ground, the so-called deeply locked gate, and even the carved beams and painted rafters, and the gloom, are all just aspects of the same object. Combined, they are the whole; separated, they are single aspects. Every aspect is correct, but every aspect cannot represent the whole.

For more than ten years, I have never forgotten this sentence. It gives me a broad perspective on life, so that I am not biased towards my own opinions, and I am willing to try to understand even the absurd theories of anyone, and I dare not despise them. Even the so-called "bright side" and "dark side" have a different meaning to me.

Little did I know that such a view has become a laughable irony in recent years. I know a reporter who works as a correspondent for two major domestic newspapers in a certain place. The positions of these two major newspapers are completely different, but he writes news reports that are acceptable to both sides without any problems. He can see both the light and the darkness of any object. The light and the darkness appear separately in two places, allowing two groups of readers to get two diametrically opposed impressions, and thus hold two different views. These two views are created under the ingenious pen of the same reporter.

People say that "a scholar is useless," but after seeing this situation, one can probably know that a scholar has other uses.

### Record of a Besieged City

— Qin Shouou

"Your affairs are easy to handle, but what about the nation's tea? Isn't tea also a resource?" Old Zhu said with a sneer, "The nation's foreign exchange comes from selling tea. But compared to your undershirts, towels, stockings, shirts, newsprint, and drawing paper, tea is worth less than a penny! Isn't it?"

Xu Shaoming couldn't help but blush at his words.

"Oh, brother!" he pleaded.

"Don't worry, I can't do anything to you!" Old Zhu put down his legs and sat upright. "In these turbulent times, it's truly the world of you businessmen and corrupt officials! Troubled waters make for good fishing. Isn't that how the old saying goes? We party newspaper reporters and those involved in theatrical movements are worthless fools. What can we do to you?"

The other party seemed somewhat uneasy.

"You absolutely don't need to worry," he said, his words full of sarcasm, but his face still smiling insincerely. "Do you think I would report you? Officials protect each other. Old Zhu wouldn't be so foolish as to write articles in the newspaper to scold you or produce plays to mock you! I've seen through it all now. No matter how well an article is written, it's useless. No matter how moving a play is performed, it's useless. In Chinese society, the hearts of some people have turned into unfeeling fossils. They still read the newspaper and watch plays. They will praise good articles and applaud good plays. But after putting down the newspaper and leaving the theater, they have no impression whatsoever! They are still them!..."

Xu Shaoming just shook his head, trying to interrupt several times but failing. At this moment, another person had entered the room; Xu Shaoming looked at her with a wry smile; Old Zhu, engrossed in his speech, didn't notice.

The person who entered was a tall, slender, and exceptionally beautiful young woman. Her demeanor and clothing powerfully indicated that she was a highly educated woman with ample knowledge. But when her gaze met Old Zhu's face, her whole body seemed to be shocked, and all her nerves tightened; although her refined upbringing allowed her to try her best to control herself, and she quickly regained her composure, her gaze could no longer be moved from this slender figure.
