There are now middle schools, primary schools, and kindergartens, with more than a thousand students, making it the most complete school in eastern Zhejiang. Behind it is a farm with lush trees. A few dozen steps away is the Chiang Clan Ancestral Hall, with a horizontal plaque written by the late Premier Sun Yat-sen, "Extensive Compassion and Love," which is the oldest building in Xikou. The Chairman's old and new residences are nearby. The old house is a seven-bay building facing south, and the new residence is next to the passage behind the old house. The open space is planted with pine and cypress trees, and the courtyard is full of green shade. The old house was bombed by enemy planes, and the bullet marks are still visible. The western end of Xikou Town is Zhongshan Park, which was ravaged by the enemy in the past and was almost a wasteland. Fortunately, after some renovation, it has regained its former appearance. The tomb of Chiang's mother is located on the northwest hillside of the park, adorned with several茅草roofed houses, which are particularly charming. Xue Dou Temple and Miaogao Terrace in the northwest of the town have excellent scenery. The Chairman built a villa here.

[Central News Agency, NANJING, 2nd] The Food Department has resolved to implement the method of raising food for the 36th year. Starting from the 36th year, the borrowing of food in all provinces and cities will be stopped. The principal and interest of grain borrowed in previous years will be determined by the central government, taking into account the local grain prices at maturity, and will be converted into legal tender and allocated for repayment, and will no longer be used to offset land tax, in order to facilitate repayment. However, in the 36th year, land tax in all provinces and cities will still be collected in kind on a temporary basis. In areas with poor grain production and inconvenient transportation, legal tender will be collected in lieu. The areas where legal tender is collected in lieu and the standards for collection in lieu will be determined by the Food Department according to the circumstances. The portion of the actual grain collected as land tax that belongs to the provinces, cities, and counties will be purchased by the central government at the standard of conversion in the neighboring currency-collecting areas. The public grain attached to the provincial and county taxes will still be used by the local governments and will not be purchased. The grain agencies in counties and cities collecting currency will be abolished, and their affairs will be handled by the county and city governments. The grain agencies in counties collecting in kind and the provincial-level grain agencies will be retained, and their expenses will be borne entirely by the central government. The Food Department will also actively promote the "Ever-Normal Granary" system. In the Yangtze River basin, the initial plan for building granaries and storing grain will be completed this year.

Editorial: The Launch of the Normal School Education Movement

In order to promote normal school education, the Ministry of Education has issued a circular to the entire country to hold a "Normal School Education Movement Week." Normal schools at all levels in Shanghai City have launched various publicity activities from March 29th to April 3rd, during the week of Youth Day and Children's Day. Other places have also expressed similar intentions. As this normal school education movement is being vigorously launched, news reports that Chairman Chiang plans to host a banquet for the staff of normal schools in the capital. All normal school graduates who have served in the education sector for more than 20 years are on the invitation list, in order to emphasize the importance of teachers. The Chairman manages a myriad of affairs every day, yet he attaches such importance to normal school education. This is truly an honor for the staff of normal school education and a bright prospect for the future of normal school education!

Normal school education is the foundation for the country to cultivate talents and the basis of education. Normal school education should be the education of education. Education is not widespread in our country, and normal school education has not yet been highly developed. Because normal school education has not been highly developed, it is difficult for education in our country to become widespread. The two are mutually causal. During the eight years of the War of Resistance Against Japan, culture and education were destroyed, and the normal school education that was in its early stages of development suffered even more brutal blows. The staff of normal school education worked as diligently and suffered as much as the soldiers who wielded weapons to defend the country. Frontline soldiers followed one another to the battlefield, risking their lives to defend the country. They are truly the unsung heroes of the country. The staff of normal school education in the rear and in the occupied areas worked hard to educate young students, tirelessly maintaining the national spirit. They are also unsung heroes of the country. After the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the whole country was in turmoil. Who cared about normal school education? Who cared about the staff of normal school education? What was expressed in reality was the discrimination and coldness of society towards normal school education personnel, the destitution of the lives of normal school education personnel, and the frustration of their prospects. However, they endured hardship and remained dedicated to their educational posts, living a life of simplicity and tranquility, and not contending with reality for short-term gains. Each of them had a hungry face, going in and out of slums and poor villages all day long, holding on to the "nationally designated textbooks," earnestly teaching people and teaching themselves, facing reality without complaining about it. They are unsung heroes, the backbone of the country, and they have maintained the righteousness of the country and the nation!

Since normal school education is so important and the staff of normal school education work so hard, the promotion of the normal school education movement should be beneficial to the future of normal school education and to the staff of normal school education. However, looking at the introduction of the content and form of normal school education in various places, and the fact that the staff of normal school education work so hard, with such meager compensation, and such a lack of security for life, old age, illness, and death, the content of the publicity does not mention any of this. In such a grand movement, if we do not appeal to the government and publicize to society in a just and upright manner, who will recognize these vast numbers of unsung heroes? Who will sympathize with these great unsung heroes? Therefore, in addition to superficial articles, we also hope that the launch of this week-long normal school education movement will truly benefit the staff of normal school education, so that they can receive substantial comfort.

Chairman Chiang has a full understanding of normal school education and great expectations for the staff of normal school education. The book "China's Destiny" pointed out: "The governance and chaos of the country, the survival and destruction of the nation, depend on the hands of these many hardworking and enduring unsung heroes who educate primary and secondary school students. It is necessary for these young students to be protected and to consciously realize their responsibility to grasp the lifeblood of the country, to sow the seeds of national survival, national independence, and perseverance in the next generation of citizens, so that the country and the nation will have a continuous supply of materials for national application in ten or twenty years. All aspects of politics and society must deeply recognize the importance of the mission of primary and secondary school education, and give it special respect and care, encouragement and rewards, so that primary and secondary school education can develop in a balanced way with university education in terms of funding and talents. If primary and secondary school education can become more sound, then psychological construction can be successful." At the same time, the Chairman encouraged modern youth to regard taking on the role of primary and secondary school teachers as the supreme treasure for today's nation-building work. In short, since normal school education is so important and the responsibilities of the staff of normal school education are so great, from now on, the social atmosphere and the government's policies should transform discrimination into respect, coldness into care, and support the development of normal school education in many ways, raising the status and treatment of the staff of normal school education! This is always the rational path to promoting normal school education.

Regarding the development of normal school education and the improvement of the status and treatment of normal school education personnel, the chapter on Basic National Policies in the Constitution of the Republic of China stipulates this as a fundamental policy for nation-building. It is hoped that the education authorities will revise or formulate education regulations based on these legislative principles. The state must guarantee education, especially normal school education. Not only must the treatment be improved, so that it can achieve equal pay for equal work with university education, but also the state must reward normal school education personnel in terms of legal systems, stipulating retirement and compensation systems after twenty years of service. If so, the primary and secondary school education line can become more sound, and the nation's education line will have a future for development. At the same time, we hope that today's normal school education personnel and normal school graduates must recognize the importance of their own responsibilities and the expectations of the head of state for us. From now on, we should be extra persevering and particularly strive, and never be pessimistic because of the dimness of the environment, nor be discouraged by the burden of life. We must be consistent, be fully loyal to the country, be greatly filial to the nation, and leave righteousness to society! The current hardship and the current simplicity are precisely the road to success in the future. As the mainstay of the country, the future will naturally have unlimited prospects!

Four Foreign Ministers Shift Focus to Discuss German Political Issues; Informal Meeting Yields No Results; Compensation Issue Stalled but Still Seems to Have Room for Maneuvering

[Our Dispatch] London, 2nd (Radio): The four foreign ministers held an informal meeting yesterday, but it yielded no progress. They will resume formal meetings today. It is understood that Marshall believes the Soviet Union will eventually seek an agreement on the issue of a provisional German government, as the Soviet Union urgently needs reparations from the British and American occupation zones and will sooner or later compromise. Marshall has no intention of changing his "tough" policy. He believes that having no agreement is better than a "paper agreement" like Potsdam. Even if he cannot break the deadlock at the Moscow conference, he will extend the meeting.

[United Press, MOSCOW, 2nd] At a time when the chances of success at the four-power conference are extremely bleak, the four foreign ministers are meeting again today as scheduled to review the form and scope of a future provisional German government. In this way, the four foreign ministers will temporarily shelve the compensation issue, which has reached a deadlock, and proceed to resolve other issues that most observers believe also contain the possibility of reaching an agreement. After a three-hour and twenty-minute closed-door meeting on the compensation issue yesterday ended in complete failure, the four foreign ministers abandoned their hopeless attempts at secret negotiations and resumed open meetings. After yesterday's meeting failed, all parties involved expressed pessimism, and there were even some rumors that the meeting might end in complete failure in the near future. However, this view is not taken seriously by most people. They acknowledge that yesterday's failure is enough to make the entire future of the conference an uncertain fact, but they also urge people to pay attention to the fact that agreements at such conferences are never easy to achieve in one fell swoop and must wait until the last possible moment. Some people speculate that Marshall, who is extremely eager to reach an agreement, may request a private meeting with Molotov's superior, Stalin. However, there is actually no indication that Marshall is considering taking this step in order to arrange a date for a meeting.

[United Press, MOSCOW, 2nd] According to reliable sources late tonight, US representatives at the Moscow Foreign Ministers Conference gathered today and Secretary of State Marshall stated that the obstacles hindering progress on the German peace treaty are expected to be eliminated. The British and French representatives at the Foreign Ministers Conference also held a meeting today. It is said that they discussed whether it would be appropriate to continue the current round table conference in Moscow. At that time, British Foreign Secretary Bevin and French Foreign Minister Bidault both expressed pessimism about the outcome of the Foreign Ministers Conference.

[United Press, MOSCOW, 1st] Well-informed sources also said that Foreign Secretary Bevin had consulted Marshall before the meeting on the views of small countries participating in the future German peace conference. Secretary Marshall replied that all countries that declared war on Germany should participate, but the number of members of the drafting committee should be limited to facilitate the work. Secretary Marshall advocated limiting the number to eighteen countries, namely those that recently presented their views to the London Deputy Foreign Ministers Conference.

[Agence France-Presse, LONDON, 2nd] The Daily Telegraph reported a dispatch from its Moscow correspondent stating that the four foreign ministers discussed a compromise plan in a closed-door meeting, proposing to allow the Soviet Union to extract reparations from Germany's existing production under certain conditions, but only if the Soviet Union complies with the four-power treaty proposed by former US Secretary of State Byrnes and reiterated by Marshall to handle German disarmament. Furthermore, the Soviet Union can only obtain these reparations when Germany is able to pay for its imports and reimburse the import trade expenses prepaid by the UK and the US. In addition to complying with the four-power treaty to prevent Germany from launching aggression again, the Soviet Union must also acknowledge that the property seized from Austria by the Germans during the occupation cannot be regarded as German property.

Whether the Yalta Secret Agreement on Reparations is Binding; Eden Asks Questions in the House of Commons

[Reuters, LONDON, 1st] Former Foreign Secretary Eden indirectly raised the issue in the House of Commons this afternoon of whether the secret agreement on reparations from the Yalta Conference will remain in effect, as Molotov claims, or has been abolished by the Potsdam Agreement, as the UK and the US claim. Eden denied that he had told the House of Commons that no secret agreement was reached at Yalta. He referred to the formal statement made by former Deputy Foreign Secretary Hall on April 11, 1945, when Hall said that the method of reparations had not been decided at that time. However, according to the recently published contents of the secret agreement, it was clearly stipulated that Germany's reparations in kind should be extracted in the following three ways: (1) the removal of Germany's national wealth; (2) the extraction of Germany's annual industrial products within a prescribed period; and (3) the use of German labor. Therefore, if the British government believed that the agreement was binding on it at that time, it should acknowledge the principle of using German labor and industrial products as reparations. The conclusion drawn from Eden's statement is that in April 1945, or before the issue of the Potsdam Agreement abolishing the Yalta secret agreement arose, the British government did not believe that the secret agreement had binding effect, but was only for discussion at the Moscow Reparations Conference.

Marshall to Propose German Federal Plan

[United Press, MOSCOW, 1st] According to Washington sources, senior US government officials revealed that Marshall will propose his plan for a federal Germany when the four powers discuss the issue of a provisional German government. The content will be that, within certain limits, Germany will draft its own constitution in accordance with the previous example of Japan. This plan is entirely based on the principle of peace and does not allow it to possess any armed forces or a federal constitution. The governors of each state are allowed to handle police work, and its foreign ministry can only deal with economic issues and has no power to sign defense or non-economic treaties.

UK Proposes Amending Anglo-Soviet Alliance Treaty

[Agence France-Presse, LONDON, 1st] It has been learned that Sir Peter, the British ambassador to the Soviet Union, has submitted the UK's proposal for amending the Anglo-Soviet Alliance Treaty to Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov.

UK Discovers Secret Organization Aiding German POWs to Escape

[Agence France-Presse, LONDON, 1st] It was recently discovered that there is a secret fascist organization in the UK that is secretly assisting German prisoners of war to escape to South America. This news has caused quite a stir in London, and five officials from the Ministry of Defense have been dismissed. This was also discussed in the House of Commons yesterday. Prime Minister Attlee also said that British detectives have already discovered the method by which German prisoners of war are escaping from the UK.

Extension of UK Conscription Act; Internal Disagreements within the Labour Party Worth Noting

[Agence France-Presse, LONDON, 2nd] The House of Commons yesterday voted down the motion against the Conscription Act by 386 votes to 85. A heated debate preceded the vote, proving that the internal divisions within the Labour Party are very significant. Of the 340 Labour MPs, only 195 supported the government, which was unexpected. Last week, observers estimated that there would be 20 votes against and 40 abstentions on the Labour benches, but the reality was different. The passage of the government's proposal today is not considered a permanent split within the Labour Party. Foreign interpretations of this vote are likely to see it as a reflection of the decline of the British people, or at least a return to apathy. Although the Conscription Bill is not perfect, it is sound in principle and flexible. If this measure had been passed in 1933, the war in 1939 might not have happened. In short, voting against this bill is extremely irresponsible.

[United Press, LONDON, 2nd] Labour rebels in Parliament said today that when Foreign Secretary Bevin returns from Moscow, they will demand that Bevin clarify British foreign policy. One of the leaders of the rebels, Zilliacus, criticized yesterday's parliamentary vote on the Conscription Bill, saying that it clearly shows that a large number of people within the Labour Party oppose the government's defense and foreign policy. When the Conscription Bill was voted on yesterday, 73 Labour MPs voted against it, and another 100 declared their abstention in defiance of party policy. Zilliacus also said that the chairman of the Labour Party's Foreign Affairs Committee, Coke, and Bevin's personal secretary in Parliament, Wells, both oppose the government. They firmly believe that British workers are unwilling to manufacture the armaments and coal needed for a war against the Soviet Union. Zilliacus continued that the Labour rebels will demand clarification of British foreign policy when Bevin returns home, and will promote a change in foreign policy at the Labour Party's annual conference in May. At the same time, according to a senior government official close to Prime Minister Attlee, some of the 73 Labour MPs who voted against the government will be expelled from the party, while only those who oppose it on "humanitarian" grounds will not be subject to this punishment.

Secret Documents Stolen from UK War Office

[Agence France-Presse, LONDON, 1st] The luggage of Major Dickinson, a staff officer in the Scottish military district, was suddenly stolen, containing secret documents from the War Office.

After China and France agree, the UK will submit the Palestine issue to the UN for handling and request the prompt convening of the UN General Assembly and the organization of a Palestine investigation committee. The US has already agreed to this, but the UK has decided to consult with the other three of the five permanent members before proceeding with this matter.

Truman Issues Statement; US Aid to Greece Plan Unchanged; New King of Greece Calls for National Unity

[United Press, WASHINGTON, 2nd] President Truman issued his first official statement mourning the late King George II of Greece and stating that the US relief plan for Greece will not change due to the king's sudden death. The statement read in part: "I am comforted that before George II's sudden death, I had assured the late King and Greece that the US would continue to be concerned about this heroic ally." At the same time, some leaders in Congress do not believe that George's death will affect the proposed aid to Greece bill, but believe that this may have an impact on Greece itself.

[Reuters, ATHENS, 1st] Paul I, the new King of Greece, was formally sworn in as the successor to the throne at the palace a few hours after his brother George's sudden death from heart disease. George's death was very sudden. He had been studying a project with the Minister of Education, Babatimos, in the palace until 1:35 PM. He felt slightly unwell when he wanted to have dinner and returned to his bedroom to go to bed. At that time, he felt dizzy. By the time his adjutant, General Melas, arrived, George was already in a dying state. The doctors arrived but were unable to help, and he died at 2:30 PM. After taking the throne, Paul broadcast to the nation, saying that "we are now facing a struggle for the survival, independence, and freedom of the nation. Without national unity, we cannot achieve successful results." King George's body will be moved to Athens Cathedral on Thursday, and a state funeral will be held on Sunday.

Flags at Half-Mast in Fifty-Five Countries

UK Compulsory Education for Children Extended by One Year from Yesterday; School Leaving Age Raised to Fifteen

[British Information Services, LONDON, 2nd] From today, all children in the UK will receive one more year of free compulsory education. According to the Education Act passed in 1944, the age at which children leave school should be raised from fourteen to fifteen. The main problem in the UK today is production, so talent is extremely important in all areas, and more complete education can provide the factories with the various talents they need, such as managers, technicians, and skilled men and women. This decision to raise the school leaving age has come into effect from today.

The German trade union in Hamburg also ordered workers to strike for a day today to protest the lack of food and fuel. Brunswick, which is not within the Ruhr area, also saw demonstrations for the first time.

[United Press, ESSEN, 2nd] Four thousand coal miners in Dutting City, in the British occupation zone of Germany, went on strike today to protest the food shortage. At the same time, trade union leaders in the city discussed whether to call for a general strike of workers in 170 coal mines in the Ruhr Valley. The British military authorities have not yet announced their official position. According to people close to the British military headquarters, the British military authorities have considered disciplinary action and full work arrangements.

[Agence France-Presse, BRUNSWICK, 2nd] About 10,000 German youths held a demonstration here yesterday. Observers said that if a general strike of coal miners in the Ruhr area were to occur, it would become one of the biggest tragedies in Europe, not only having a drastic impact on Germany but also having repercussions for neighboring countries.

[Agence France-Presse, ESSEN, 2nd] A British representative has gone to Bochum to negotiate with trade union representatives to stop the general strike of 300,000 miners in the Ruhr area.

An Annual Grand Event: Chengdu Flower Fair
March 17th Airmail News - Our Correspondent in Chengdu, Zhou Xueduan
Around the time of the Qingming Festival, with the beautiful spring scenery, the annual Chengdu Flower Fair has recently opened. Mentioning the Flower Fair, it is renowned far and wide, and anyone who has ever visited Chengdu will undoubtedly cherish wonderful memories. It is recalled that in the 32nd year [of the Republic, i.e., 1943], the Sichuan Provincial Government held a National (the Great Rear Area at the time) Products Exhibition at the Flower Fair, inviting first-class journalists from across the country to organize and visit (led by Mr. Xiao Tongzi, President of the Central News Agency). It was a major event in Chinese journalism during the war, and it was unanimously praised afterward.
The significant meaning of the Chengdu Flower Fair is not only for sightseeing but also possesses dual great qualities. First, tracing the history of the Flower Fair, it is almost over two thousand years old, consistently representing the economic form of China's rural industry and commerce. Second, the Flower Fair takes place around the second and third months of the lunar calendar each year, which is precisely the season when "the whole year's plan is made in spring." The true significance of holding the Flower Fair has evolved from the "Silk Market" and "Flower Market" of ancient times, where trade facilitated the exchange of goods, to the "Industrial Promotion Fair" of the late Qing Dynasty, and then to the various "Industrial and Commercial Exhibitions" and "Product Competitions" of the Republic of China. The intention has always been to encourage through competition, using exhibitions for observation, promoting industry and commerce, and encouraging people to work, which has been the most concrete policy and effective method for supporting industry and commerce throughout Chinese history.

Flower Fair Anecdotes: Metamorphosis of the Silk Market and Flower Market - Nearly Two to Three Thousand Years
The Chengdu Flower Fair can be said to be the longest-running gathering in Chinese history. Tracing back to the predecessor of the Flower Fair, it evolved from the "Silk Market" and "Flower Market" of Chengdu. Regarding the history of the "Silk Market," according to "Maoting Kehua" (茅亭客話) it states: "Shu has a Silk Market, from the first to the third month of each year. Elders pass down that the ancient Silk Industry Clan was the master of Shu. The people had no fixed residence, following the location of the silk industry to establish markets and settlements. This is a remnant of that custom, or it is said that the silk industry is about to flourish, hence the name, and thus the tools for sericulture, as well as flowers, trees, fruits, herbs, and miscellaneous items are traded." Also, "Chengdu Gujin Ji" (成都古今記) records: "On the first and second days of the third month, the people of Shu pray for blessings and trade at Longqiao, called the Silk Market." Furthermore, "Wuguo Gushi" (五國故事) states: "In Shu, the third month of each year is the Silk Market. At that time, goods are gathered for easy exchange, filling the Min area. Wang Jian once wanted to levy heavy taxes." From historical facts, it can be inferred that the Silk Market in Chengdu has a history of over three thousand years.
The direct predecessor of the Flower Fair is the "Flower Market." The history of the Flower Market originates from the early Tang Dynasty. At that time, Chengdu, along with Chang'an and Yangzhou, stood as the three major cities in the country, with prosperous trade throughout the world. Every year in February, the "Flower Market" was held at the current location of the Flower Fair, as a place for ladies and gentlemen to enjoy themselves and for merchants to trade. "Chengdu Zhanjin Ji" (成都占今記) mentions "Chengdu's Flower Market in February," and Tang Xiao's poem states, "Late in the month, I already hear the Flower Market assembling," indicating that it already had a certain form at that time. During the reign of Emperor Taizong of the Northern Song Dynasty, Zhang Yong, as the governor of Chengdu, designated February as the date for the annual Flower Market. Xue Tian's poem about Chengdu affairs in the Song Dynasty includes the line, "Flower Market in the spring breeze, behind embroidered curtains." Yuan Jia's "Suihua Jili Pu" (歲華紀麗譜) records that during the reign of Emperor Huizong of the Song Dynasty, Zhao Fu, the governor of Chengdu, opened the West Tower pavilions and enlarged the Flower Market for the scholars and commoners to enjoy and observe every year during the Cold Food Festival. Teahouses and shops flourished exceptionally, and the garden was closed every year in December, ceasing only after a month. Since then, the annual Flower Market has been held until the late Qing Dynasty, with a history of about two thousand years.
The Silk Market and Flower Market were held at similar times, and the locations were not far apart. By the thirty-third year of Guangxu [1907], Zhou Xiaohuai, who was in charge of industrial affairs in Sichuan, merged the Silk Market and Flower Market, expanding it into the current Flower Fair. It was named the Sichuan Industrial Promotion Fair, calling on the Industrial Promotion Bureaus to collect special products and send them to the fairgrounds, both for exhibition and sale at a price, to promote trade within the province. Since then, the scale has been greatly enhanced, becoming a regular event held annually.
From the ancient market, during the Qin and Han dynasties, the people of Shu began to exchange medicinal materials and silkworm silk with the Qiang and Rong peoples. Later, the Flower Market merged and evolved into the current Flower Fair. The intention is to promote local products and boost trade. Therefore, the Chengdu Flower Fair can be said to be the largest-scale and longest-running "National Goods Market" in the country.

Grand Scene of the Fair: Everything for Eating and Entertainment - 250,000 Visitors Daily
This year's Flower Fair is named the "Chengdu Industrial Promotion Fair," also known as the "National Goods Exhibition." The location is still at the Qingyang Palace and Erxian'an outside Chengdu's western city (this is a tradition inherited for over two thousand years). Qingyang Palace is one of China's historically significant temples, built before the Tang Dynasty. According to legend, Lao Tzu rode a bull westward out of the Hangu Pass, met Yin Xi, the gatekeeper, and stayed to write the world-renowned philosophical work, the "Tao Te Ching" (道德經), consisting of five thousand words. Before leaving, he told Yin Xi, "After a thousand days of practicing the Tao, you can await me at the Qingyang Market in Chengdu." Later generations built the Qingyang Palace based on this. Erxian'an was built in the Qing Dynasty, both being famous ancient temples in Chengdu. The fairground is about three li (approximately one mile) in length and width, divided into six major sections: exhibition area, agricultural tools, flowers and fruits, local specialties, food, and entertainment. Among them, the most meaningful are the exhibition area and the local specialties display area.
The exhibition area is located in the center of the fairground, with a grand scale and rich exhibits. The main purpose of this conference is to develop Sichuan's light industry, promote indigenous handicrafts, enlighten people's understanding of national defense industrialization and agricultural scientification, and advocate the "Love and Use National Goods" movement. The exhibits are mostly high-quality products from Sichuan's light industry and handicrafts, as well as models of heavy industry and hydraulic power. Most notably, the world-renowned Dujiangyan irrigation system has a complete model on display at the fairground, including Tan Dui, Fulingguan, Shijiankou, Xiangbizi, Anlan Bridge, Yuzui, Shu Cha, and Yudieguan, all with accurate and lifelike features. The exhibition area has three major exhibition halls. The first two halls display handicrafts from across Sichuan, and the third hall displays electrical machinery, mechanical products, and models. A total of 260 units are participating in the craft exhibition, including factories large and small, and various handicrafts from all over Sichuan. In addition, local specialties from across the country are also being collected. The exhibits include ten major categories such as agronomy, handicrafts, new medicines, clothing, cosmetics, ceramics, hardware industry, scientific instruments, and educational stationery, totaling 2,600 items. All specialties from all over the country and products from famous factories are included, large and small, truly a dazzling array of beautiful items, worthy of being called a national goods exhibition.
Another section for local specialties is located in the southwest of the fairground, including native products brought in from affiliated provinces and counties for sale. Famous examples include leather goods from Shaanxi and Gansu, red woolen cloth, Tibetan incense, and musk from Tibet, as well as Taobamboo sticks from Dianjiang, porcelain from Pengxian, bamboo products from Jiang'an, linen from Longchang, Shu brocade from Chengdu, and silk from Jiading and Shunqing. Products from distant places such as Guangdong seafood, Fujian lacquerware, Hunan embroidery, Hangzhou silk, and Suzhou weaving workshops are also on display.

Industrial Promotion Exhibition: Over 2,000 Items on Display - Including National Goods and Specialties
In addition to the exhibition, another significance of the Flower Fair is to provide people with entertainment and enjoyment. Most of the fairground is dedicated to entertainment venues, restaurants, snack stalls, and teahouses. Sichuan cuisine is famous throughout the country, and Chengdu is the headquarters of Sichuan cuisine. There are temporary business locations for major Chengdu restaurants throughout the fairground, such as the famous Gu Gu restaurant. Chengdu snacks are unparalleled, and snack stalls are scattered everywhere at the fair, offering a complete range of sweet and savory options, with over a hundred varieties. There are always no empty seats. Famous examples include Wu's Wonton, Lai's Sweet Dumplings, Zhong's Dumplings, Tuozi Noodles, Zhao's Cold Noodles, Shuangliu Noodles, Ren Shi Sesame Pastries, and the Three Great Cannons (sugar glutinous rice cakes). There are reportedly over fifty teahouses at the fair, always filled with guests. According to surveys, daily spending on food exceeds 30 million yuan, a truly astonishing consumption figure.
The entertainment section includes Peking opera, Sichuan opera, spoken drama, martial arts troupes, magic shows, as well as Sichuan's unique bamboo clapper (Daoqing) and Yangqin, encompassing all kinds of performances and strange wonders. At the end of the Flower Fair, there is also a national martial arts competition, bringing together heroes from the north and south to compete on stage for gold medals. There is also a horse racing event, with famous horses from Sichuan and Xikang gathering, running in a red blur. This extends the lifespan of the Flower Fair to April and May.
For the more refined tastes, there are exhibitions of cherished items such as chinaware, gold ornaments, curios, and calligraphy, gathering the jewelry and jade from Chengdu and unique wood carvings. The continuation of the wood and iron market still involves collections of farm tools. The flower market, as the traditional core of the Flower Fair, is colorful this year, occupying just over 20 mu (about 3.3 acres), displaying no more than a thousand peonies, spring orchids, peach blossoms, plum blossoms, and begonia plants.
This year's fair lasts from the second lunar month to April. The exhibition opened on March 16th of the solar calendar. The number of spectators and tourists this year is less than in previous years, but according to statistics, the number of visitors on the first day exceeded 250,000. Currently, airmail flights have resumed, and it is believed that more visitors from outside the province will arrive in the future. If tourists come not only for enjoyment but also for sightseeing, this grand event that has lasted for two to three thousand years, from the intention of promoting commercial trade by predecessors to the current emphasis on seeking progress and innovation from exhibitions, can boost industrial and commercial prosperity. In today's national environment where foreign goods flood the country and industry and commerce are on the verge of collapse, the Chengdu Flower Fair has qualities worth emulating by major cities across the country.
### Record of Dyke Construction on the Dongjiang River in Guangdong Province: 10,000 Workers Mobilized Daily
March 28th, Hong Kong Airmail News - Xiao An
The three rivers, east, west, and north, of Guangdong Province, are prone to floods every summer, causing great suffering. The water conservancy authorities of Guangdong Province have been planning to manage them, but there have been no satisfactory results. Currently, on the Dongjiang River, thanks to the years of advocacy by General Qiu Zhaoqin, the dyke construction project has been implemented in the Huizhou section, a key area of the Dongjiang River. In the future, the Huizhou area will no longer be completely affected by Dongjiang River floods. It is learned that General Qiu's initiative to build a dyke in Huizhou began during the Anti-Japanese War, immediately after the enemy retreated from Huizhou for the third time. At that time, the area was extremely devastated, and floods wreaked havoc again. General Qiu felt compassion and requested the Chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Government, Li Hanhun, to construct Yingchang Zhengfeng and repair the Mawei to secure the livelihood of the people. He received permission from the provincial government and Yingchang, and a survey team was sent to conduct measurements. The construction plan began to be implemented in January of the 34th year of the Republic [1945], but the enemy suddenly attacked Huizhou again, and Huizhou City fell for the fourth time. Work was interrupted just a few days after it started. After the victory, General Qiu continued tirelessly to carry out the project. Although the construction plan remained unchanged, the construction funds were re-estimated and re-planned. Construction officially began in the upper ten days of December of the 35th year of the Republic [1946], with the goal of completing it all in 120 days.
A panoramic view of the construction site shows that women are the most active.
Yesterday, the reporter traveled from Hong Kong to the construction site for an on-site inspection and carefully observed the construction project. The project is divided into two aspects: one is the Ma'an Dam, which runs from Tanwu to Ma'an for a total length of eight kilometers, requiring about 500,000 cubic meters of earthwork. It is now 70% complete. Because it is scheduled to be completed before April 15th, night shifts have been added. The project is contracted to merchants, and the construction office supervises the work very closely, so the project is progressing well. The other is Pengying School, also known as the Old Dam, which runs from Tanwu, connecting to the Ma'an Dam, to Sanshan, for a total length of 22 kilometers, requiring 300,000 cubic meters of earthwork. Also, from Heshan Water Gate to Heshanmen, the total length is over 800 meters, requiring 40,000 cubic meters of earthwork, and the project is about to be completed. This is a type of project using civilian labor, where the Baojia chiefs notify each household to send workers. The entire line of this dam is long, but the earthwork is less because it involves raising and thickening the original dyke along the Dongjiang River. The total length of the two dams is almost 30 kilometers. On the first day, the reporter inspected the important projects and sluice gates of the Ma'an Dam, which were over 70% complete, and much of the work was done in continuous spring rain. On the second day, the reporter inspected the Old Dam, passing through Shuikou, Qingbian, and Wannian. Women are the most enthusiastic in their work, and they are very strong in digging and carrying mud, especially in their dedication to hard work without idle talk. It is expected that they deeply understand the harm caused by floods, so they can exert themselves so much. When the dam is completed in the future, the women of Huizhou County will have made a great contribution. In addition to the earthwork project, there is the sluice gate project. There are five sluice gates on the Ma'an Dam, of which four have been completed. Only the largest, the Dahu Stream Sluice Gate, is under construction. The foundation has been completed, and it is expected that all gates can be completed by the end of April. There is one sluice gate on the Old Dam, located in Qingbian, and another at Heshanmen, both of which can be completed in mid-April. Among these seven sluice gates, the Heshanmen gate is a vertical gate, and the other six are rolling gates.

Farmland Benefited - Will Reach 200,000 Mu
According to Li Zefu, the director of the construction office appointed by the Construction Committee, 10,000 to 15,000 people participate in the work every day. After the completion of the project, the farmland benefited will reach 200,000 mu, which can increase grain production by 600,000 dan per year, which is of great importance to the people's food supply. According to Qiu Zhaoqin, the chairman of the board, the 200,000 mu of farmland benefited includes more than 30,000 mu of wasteland. He is currently specially engaging experts to study land reclamation methods and stipulating that each mu's value can be purchased by various schools and charitable organizations to fill the fund. This will not only allow the people within the dam to live in peace but also increase production and lay the foundation for education and technology. When the reporter accompanied Chairman Qiu to inspect the two dams, he often saw Qiu patiently guiding the villagers to work hard on the earthwork, instructing the workers not to be careless or negligent, and explaining the overall plan of building the dam to the villagers who did not understand it. Therefore, he constantly traveled between the city and the countryside, working extremely hard. At the same time, he also personally contacted the government to ensure close coordination to facilitate the project. Qiu's residence is outside the dam area, in the area subject to flooding, but he has never sought personal gain. This shows his selfless dedication to seeking the welfare of the people.

Publishing Industry Weekly: "Essentials of Classical Studies"
By Shen Wenzhuo
Written by Zhu Ziqing, Published by Wenguang Bookstore
Our country's classical books are as vast as the ocean, and engaging in their study often leads to a sense of helplessness. In the past, the approach was to read them one by one, resulting in scholars taking many detours and ultimately failing to grasp the essentials, leading to abandonment. Only those with extraordinary wisdom could achieve success. The reason for this lies in the absence of a comprehensive guide that allows for a systematic and progressive approach. Modern scholars have been able to recognize this, leading to the emergence of books on general introductions to sinology and histories of Chinese literature like bamboo shoots after rain. However, upon examining their content, these authors often possess only a superficial understanding, lacking the ability to synthesize knowledge broadly and fluently. Compiled through piecemeal efforts, these books are often disregarded by those with a solid foundation. For beginners, they remain overwhelmed and at a loss. To have a book that is organized, well-paced, and able to explain complex ideas simply, sparking an interest in Chinese classics for beginners, while still providing valuable references for those with a foundation, Zhu Ziqing's "Essentials of Classical Studies" is the book to consider.
The strengths of this book can be summarized as follows: 1. The language is clear, concise, and fluent. 2. The insights are precise and succinct. 3. It selects the most important classics from the four categories (Classics, History, Philosophy, and Literature), dedicating a chapter to each for discussion. 4. It avoids discussing areas of academic debate from the past or present, only citing the most accurate conclusions. 5. It distinguishes between authentic and forged texts. 6. It traces the origins and discusses the influence of each classic. These strengths are enough to ensure its lasting value.
The author titled the book "Essentials of Classical Studies," but it is by no means a mere casual discussion. It contains valuable content that is organized and systematic. A deep understanding of Chinese classics is required to achieve such a level of depth.
The term "Classics" in the past specifically referred to the Five Classics, Six Arts, Seven Classics, Nine Classics, and even the Thirteen Classics. The term "Classics" is used in contrast to "Philosophy," "History," and "Literature." Lu Deming's "Classical Interpretations of Texts" (經典釋文) includes the "Laozi" (老子) and "Zhuangzi" (莊子) within the Classics, perhaps because the Tang Dynasty revered Daoism, referring to the "Laozi" as the "Tao Te Ching" (道德經) and the "Zhuangzi" as the "True Classic of Southern China" (南華眞經). Now, this book includes History, the Han Dynasty, Ci-fu, Poetry, and Prose in the Classics, which seems unprecedented. The author states, "The term 'Classics' in this book is used in a broad sense." However, I think the Buddhist scriptures, divided into sutras, vinaya, and sastras, strictly define the Buddha's words as sutras and the explanations and elaborations of the Buddha's words by bodhisattvas as sastras. Compared to our practice of including books like the Erya, the Three Commentaries, and the Book of Rites as explanations of the Classics, it already seems much broader. Now, for the author to refer to all kinds of classical books in our country as "Classics" seems to have the same general problem as terms like "Sinology" or "Chinese Studies"! - Although, in fact, there is no appropriate term to name it!
Below, I will raise a few questions to discuss with the author, perhaps for his reference or guidance.
The issue of selection and omission of the classics. As mentioned above, the book selects the most important classics and dedicates a chapter to each for discussion. Therefore, the standard for selection and omission should be noted. The first chapter is on "Shuowen Jiezi" (說文解字), the author states; "To understand the older books, especially the Classics and philosophical works, one must understand philology; therefore, character dictionaries such as 'Shuowen Jiezi' are also part of the Classics. According to traditional views, 'philology' is placed first." This is very correct. Furthermore, although this chapter focuses on "Shuowen," it still traces back to oracle bone inscriptions and bronze inscriptions, and down to clerical script, cursive script, regular script, and running script, explaining the origins of characters clearly, which is especially valuable. However, since characters must have form, sound, and meaning, then phonology is an important part that must be explained, from the Han people's homophone annotations and the four tones and fanqie of the Wei and Jin dynasties to the ancient rhyme divisions studied by Qing scholars. The book lacks information on this aspect. Furthermore, the author elucidates the Six Scripts, but does not mention the Erya, which focuses on derivative meanings and loan characters. The Erya is an indispensable book for understanding the Classics, especially the Mao Commentary on the Book of Odes. Therefore, this is an undeniable oversight in the book. Also, the seventh chapter is on the Four Books, and the Great Learning and the Doctrine of the Mean are specifically separated and placed alongside the Analects and Mencius, which is a Song Dynasty perspective. Believing that the theories of the Great Learning and the Doctrine of the Mean are valuable, then why are the Confucian Conduct in the Book of Rites not valuable? Therefore, I think the author is too conventional here. Most surprisingly, the Classic of Filial Piety is forgotten. The Classic of Filial Piety is a very important book in the eyes of Confucianists, as the saying goes, "Confucius studied in the Spring and Autumn Annals and practiced in the Classic of Filial Piety." Our country's ethics emphasize filial piety first and foremost, and excluding it is not appropriate. Therefore, according to my opinion, the Classic of Filial Piety and the Analects should be placed in one chapter; return the Great Learning and the Doctrine of the Mean to the Book of Rites, and expand the length of the chapter on the Three Commentaries (dividing a section to discuss the Great Learning, the Doctrine of the Mean, and Confucian Conduct). I wonder what the author and revisers think of this? This is the first point.
The issue of not including commentaries on the Classics. From the Book of Changes and the Book of Documents to the Four Books, the author has completely erased all these commentaries, regardless of their quality. Although the author believes that the commentaries are forced interpretations and not credible, we should use our own eyes to interpret the original text of the Classics and not be bound by them. The argument is very correct, and the forced interpretations in the commentaries are also a fact. However, I do not believe that the efforts and wisdom of the predecessors are completely without merit. Their insights are not inferior to ours. Furthermore, the purpose of this book is that "the value of classical training lies not in practicality but in culture," and "the purpose of reading the Classics is to teach people to understand the Classics." Then, is it not necessary for us to examine and critique the achievements of those who have read the Classics throughout history and received classical training? For example, regarding the Book of Changes, we may discard the incomplete theories of the Six Schools. However, the celestial stems and earthly branches of Zheng Xuan and the waxing and waning theories of Yu Fan in the late Han Dynasty have been organized quite well by Qing scholars, and there is no reason to abandon them! Also, Wang Bi's interpretation of the Book of Changes using Lao-Zhuang thought is the center of metaphysics and is very insightful. Are there no values in the more accessible Cheng's Commentary and Zhu's Collected Annotations? For example, although Kong Anguo's commentary on the Book of Documents has been proven to be a forgery like the Ancient Text Book of Documents, Qing scholars used different texts cited in the Records of the Grand Historian to know that Sima Qian had asked Kong Anguo about it. This shows that it is a genuine ancient text of Kong Anguo, so Kong's commentary has not been completely lost. These should not only not be ignored, but also should be particularly cherished. Furthermore, Zheng Xuan's commentary on the Three Rites is truly grand, profound, and comprehensive. He uses the Han Dynasty system to speculate on the systems of the Three Dynasties. Although it cannot make us completely believe, at least we must respect that he is more than a thousand years earlier than us and should know more than us. What he said must have a basis and is not a fabrication. Later, the annotations of the Tang people contain the crystallization of the Wei, Jin, and Six Dynasties, but the author places it in the chapter on "Literature" and appreciates it as a literary style, which is really laughable. This is the second point.
The issue of detail. The author uses twenty pages to criticize the merits and demerits of the Histories of Sima Qian and Ban Gu, and to record the deeds of Sima Qian and Ban Gu. However, he uses only seven pages to explain the Three Rites and fifteen pages to discuss the philosophers. I think this is an imbalance in detail. Since the Four Books have a dedicated chapter, the philosophers should not be discussed so generally together; at least each school, such as Confucianism, Mohism, Legalism, and Daoism, should have a dedicated chapter to be proportionate. Furthermore, given the complexity of the Three Rites, even hundreds of pages would not be enough to explain it clearly. However, the content such as sacrifices to heaven and earth, ancestral halls, the four seasons, capping, weddings, drinking rituals, diplomatic missions, funerals, sacrifices, and the eight laws of the Grand Steward must also be briefly described. The author does not mention a word, only vaguely saying things like: "The Book of Etiquette and Ceremonies is a mixture of religious rituals and customs; the Book of Zhou Rituals is a set of ideal political systems." It is impossible for people to know what the Three Rites actually are. Compared to the chapters on "Histories," "Poetry," and "Prose," which are described in such detail, it is almost suspected that they were not written by the same person. Also, the chapter on "Ci-fu" only discusses the Chu Ci, briefly describing the fu after the Han Dynasty. Other examples include the chapter on "Prose," which directly discusses the new literary style, while the chapter on "Poetry" only covers up to the Song Dynasty. Also, two to three hundred words are used to discuss the Selections of Refined Literature, while more than a thousand words are used to describe the legendary novels, and more than five hundred words are used to discuss the eight-legged essay. These are all problems of imbalance in detail that must be pointed out to the author! This is the third point.
The above may be criticized by the author as nitpicking. However, in order to achieve a complete and flawless work, these minor points should not be ignored. Although I admit that these "minor flaws" will not overshadow its "major merits"!

"On the Substance"
By Shu Yan
Author: Bai Xu, Publisher: Zaisheng Publishing House
This is a small booklet published by Zaisheng Publishing House in July last year. In today's barren cultural landscape, such a purely academic work is a rare and welcome sound that deserves our excitement.
The book is divided into four major outlines, each with four sub-items. Fortunately, the outlines and sub-items are not lengthy. They are listed below for the reader's benefit.

1.  On Substance: Substance does not arise or diminish, is not constant or discontinuous, is not one or different, does not come or go. Terms such as Reason, Dao, Nature, Heaven, and Suchness all have different names but refer to the same thing as Substance.
2.  Substance: Is neither mind, nor matter; neither shared, nor unique. Its nature transcends comprehension.
3.  Substance: Has being and non-being. Through being, its nature is empty; through non-being, its nature is empty.
4.  All things are the being of Substance, which is also the function of Substance. Substance and function are two but not two.

The following are the four sub-items:
1. On Metaphysics
2. On Mind and Nature
3. On Metaphysical Logic and Experience, and the Fundamentals of Learning
4. On Being and Non-being

In the first outline, the author briefly states that the traditional spirit of Chinese culture lies in seeing Substance. In recent times, Mr. Feng Youlan and Mr. Jin Yuelin have also written on the subject, leading to scholars gradually paying attention to metaphysical issues.
Under the second outline, the author points out the distinction between the metaphysical and metaphysics. Metaphysics is not necessarily metaphysical. If I have not misunderstood the author, I can say that metaphysics can only describe the traces of Substance but cannot explain the origin and changes of Substance. As for the word "only" in idealism and materialism, it loses the vibrant and harmonious nature of Substance. Therefore, the author points out that one cannot obtain true philosophical training from works commonly referred to as idealist or materialist.
Next, the author discusses the issue of particulars, universals, and priority, emphasizing that universals are more fundamental than particulars. The author believes that empiricism leads to skepticism. However, rationalism is not without fault. The fault of rationalism seems to lie in not knowing how to use transcendence to criticize reason itself. Transcendence is the boundary of reason and the beginning of authentication.
Under the third outline, the author points out that from the internal aspect of Substance, everything that exists is possessed by Substance, and everything that does not exist is not possessed by Substance. From the transcendental aspect of Substance, nothing can be attached to Substance.
This is the author's attempt to speak about the unspeakable Substance, which is what the author calls indication.
Based on the above discussion, it is natural to move on to the fourth outline.
Everything that exists is possessed by Substance, so all things are the being of Substance. Nothing can be attached to Substance, so it does not have a specific name. Conversely, nothing is the location of Substance. We can speak of Substance in terms of function, and we can speak of function in terms of Substance. Therefore, the author points out that Substance and function are two but not two.
In the four sub-items, the author first points out that when analyzing experience, we cannot help but rely on universals, which are the only criteria we have for recognizing things. However, on the other hand, the self-nature of a particular thing is not a universal, or countless universals, that can fully explain it.
Only Substance can be used to explain the satisfaction of the requirements of self-nature. Substance does not affirm any empirical fact. Every current fact is the final entity.
Under this view, the old problem that has been debated endlessly in China in the past, the so-called "mind is principle" or "nature is principle," can also be resolved. Thinking from the transcendental aspect, a thing has the nature of a thing, which is the principle of a thing. If one thinks from the internal aspect, "mind is principle," speaking of principle in terms of mind, one can immediately realize it, which is not without a kind of intimate enlightenment.
In the third sub-item, the author points out that philosophers do not necessarily need to be deeply versed in logic, but logic does not conflict with philosophy. Although logic cannot deal with all knowledge, one cannot truly understand philosophy without deeply understanding what logic is. Logic is a bridge between the metaphysical and the experiential.
The above is a rough introduction to the content of On Substance.
First, we note that in the first outline, the author points out that "does not arise or diminish, is not constant or discontinuous, is not one or different, does not come or go." These eight "not's" violate the law of excluded middle and do not conform to the category of logic. These purely metaphysical propositions must be handled separately from purely logical propositions.
There seem to be two types of propositions that are not subject to logical categories: one is pure metaphysical propositions, which are beyond experience, and the other is propositions eliminated by logic.
We especially regret that the author of this book failed to make a detailed analysis of the propositions that logic cannot deal with (metaphysical propositions beyond experience) and the propositions that logic eliminates. That is, the author's statement that a trans-experiential proposition is established by analyzing experience has not fulfilled its true responsibility.
Although the author proposes the distinction between inconceivable and unthinkable in the second outline, he has not been able to find the necessary basis for these eight "not's" outside the scope of experience. He does not seem to be able to guarantee that these eight "not's" will not be eliminated by logic.
The author proposes that there is nothing in the world, and fools trouble themselves, but there are clearly things after troubling. If the author respects the facts, then there is nothing in the world is one thing, and whether fools trouble themselves is another. If A represents having something happen, -A represents originally nothing happening, A2 represents having something happen after troubling - Aa represents not having something happen, with a fool troubling himself, we do not seem to say that Aa or -Aa = A.
The author may say that if there is something, then there cannot be nothing. Since there is something happening after troubling, then there is of course nothing in the world. This seems to have overlooked that what is logically possible and what is actually possible are not necessarily the same.

On American Children's Books
By Hu Shuyi
Last year, the author conducted a survey of children's books in the United States. In addition to collecting children's books and studying them at the Columbia University Children's Library, the author also consulted with Professor Batzner, an expert in American children's books. Based on the materials gathered from various sources, the author believes that American children's books have the following characteristics in terms of writing:
1. Interest
Interest is the most important condition for children's books. In addition to selecting topics that are of great interest to children, the content of the books should also have a lively structure. The layout style and paper colors should also be aesthetically pleasing to win the children's favor. Interest has both temporary and permanent aspects. Of course, topics with permanent appeal are most suitable for writing and editing. To solve the problem of interest, many publishers have spent a lot of time and money inviting psychologists and elementary school teachers to discuss the editorial policy, topics, and other issues of children's books.

2. Creativity
American education aims to develop individuality and foster creativity. Naturally, the creation of children's books cannot be separated from the element of "creativity." Various stories aim to stimulate children's minds and awaken their thoughts. Questions like "What's happen!..." demonstrate children's curiosity, and also show that they are thinking with their little brains. This will cultivate children's habits of free creation anytime and anywhere.

3. Illustrations
Children are most interested in picture books, so illustrations occupy a very important position in children's books. In the field of American children's books, no expense is spared to pursue the perfection

### Participation in the National Government Committee: List of Democratic League and Youth Parties Determined; Democratic Socialist Party Names Xu Chuanlin and Three Others

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Democratic Socialist Party held a Central Standing Committee meeting yesterday afternoon, where the list of participants in the National Government Committee was decided. Afterwards, Sun Baoyi, the party's spokesperson, issued a written statement saying: "The steps to participate in the government will be decided by the chairman (i.e., Zhang Junli). The list for participating in the National Government Committee has been finalized. The chairman will go to Nanjing in three days to sign the twelve-point common platform." This reporter then separately interviewed Hu Haimen and Xu Chuanlin. According to Mr. Hu, the meeting yesterday resolved four key points: (1) First, participate in the National Government Committee; (2) The candidates to participate in the government are nominated as Xu Chuanlin, Wu Xianzi, Hu Haimen, and Zhan Yiqiao (the order is determined by the number of votes received). However, Xu Chuanlin immediately expressed his refusal, and it was immediately decided to submit the names of Wu, Hu, and Zhan to the government first. (3) Regarding the Executive Yuan, whether participation is limited to the Political Affairs Committee, or whether other ministries will also participate, the votes were evenly split during the vote. Therefore, it was decided that Chairman Zhang Junli would make a decision later, and the list would be drafted by Zhang and then submitted to the Central Standing Committee for approval. (4) Zhang Junli was nominated to represent the Democratic Socialist Party to sign the twelve-point common governance platform in Nanjing today (the 3rd). Furthermore, Mr. Xu Chuanlin told the reporter that his attitude towards declining the position of Government Committee member was roughly: "I believe that the Government Committee is a position with relatively little actual responsibility, so I am not interested." He is willing to continue serving as the vice president of the Constitutional Implementation Promotion Association and work hard for the implementation of constitutionalism. In addition, of the four Government Committee members nominated by the Democratic Socialist Party this time, except for Wu Xianzi, who was originally a member of the Democratic Constitutional Party, the other three were all former members of the National Socialist Party.

[Our Newspaper's Report] The Youth Party held a discussion meeting at Zuo Shunsheng's residence yesterday morning, and then held a Central Standing Committee meeting at the party headquarters on Haig Road in the afternoon, where the list of participants in the Government Committee was decided. This list will be announced by the National Government in the next few days together with the list from the Democratic Socialist Party.

[Another Report] Jiang Yuntian of the Democratic Socialist Party took the 11 pm train to Nanjing last night. Zhang Junli is also planning to go to Nanjing in the next day or two. Zuo Shunsheng, Li Pu, and Yu Jiaju of the Youth Party are scheduled to go to Nanjing with Lei Zhen at about 1 pm this afternoon.

Government Reorganization to be Realized Within Days; Zhang Qun to Assume Position of Executive Yuan President

[Our Newspaper's Nanjing, 2nd Dispatch] Interior Minister Zhang Lisheng told reporters that the government reorganization is expected to be finalized within a few days. Regarding the number of Government Committee members, he believes that the government will definitely not dispute over one or two positions. Regarding the candidate for President of the Executive Yuan, there is no problem with Zhang Qun. However, the reorganized Executive Yuan, like forming a cabinet, should be particularly cautious. Before Zhang takes office, he should be tested in many ways. However, Minister Zhang stated that the realization period must not be far off.

[Our Newspaper's Nanjing, 2nd Dispatch] The newly appointed Deputy Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan, Pu Xuefeng, visited the Yuan on the 2nd to observe matters, handled the handover with the former Deputy Secretary-General Zhu Zhongdao, and held separate talks with colleagues in the Yuan. Zhu left Nanjing for Shanghai in the afternoon. Pu told reporters that his current work is to review files to understand the overall situation. The date of Secretary-General Gan Naiguang's arrival at the Yuan has not yet been determined.

### Hu Shi Eloquently Discusses Political Parties: Anglo-American Organization is More Relaxed; Soviet Style Does Not Tolerate the Existence of Dissident Parties

[Our Newspaper's Beiping, 2nd Dispatch] A Nanjing telegram from a Beiping newspaper stated: The government intends to appoint Hu Shi as a member of the National Government Committee in the capacity of a social elite, but Hu has declined. Today, the reporter made a special visit to Mr. Hu. Hu did not confirm or deny this, only stating: "Running a school is also doing things for the country. Frequent changes in school personnel are not good. The National Government Committee will be a decision-making body for the country in the future. Government Committee members must be stationed in Nanjing permanently. If they hold concurrent positions, it will inevitably delay public affairs." Mr. Hu then discussed the issue of government reorganization and implementation of constitutionalism, believing that this is an unprecedented move. Mr. Hu said: "At present, political parties in the world can be divided into two types. One type is the Anglo-American political parties in Western and Northern Europe, whose organization is extremely relaxed. The number of party members is uncertain, and because anonymous voting is used, those who vote for their party are allowed to do so freely, and the party does not impose discipline or interfere. They obtain power through votes, and they also obediently step down when they lose votes. This type can be tentatively called Party A. Since the October Revolution in the Soviet Union, a different type of political party has emerged in Eastern Europe. They seize power through bloodshed, and once they have obtained power, they must do everything possible to defend it. They do not tolerate the existence of dissident parties, and they themselves are unwilling to be an opposition party. They must have one-party rule before they are satisfied. The political party founded by Mr. Sun Yat-sen at the beginning of the revolution originally belonged to Party A. However, after thirteen years, due to Soviet influence and assistance, the Kuomintang was reorganized into Party B. However, Mr. Sun was still deeply influenced by Anglo-American political concepts, so his entire legacy never regarded one-party rule as the ultimate goal, but only as a transitional form, which is political tutelage. The final ideal is still constitutionalism. Today, the Kuomintang is reorganizing and the government is implementing constitutionalism, influenced by internal and external situations, but also relying on Mr. Sun's legacy. Looking at the past and present, it is still unprecedented for the Kuomintang to move from Party B to Party A. Secondly, the Kuomintang is a ruling party. Now it is opening up power to parties or individuals outside the party, inviting people from parties outside the party to participate in the government and govern together. This is also unprecedented for a ruling party."

### Leighton Stuart Has No Hostility; US Ambassador Unlikely to Change; Report of Hornbeck Succeeding is Inaccurate

[Central News Agency, Washington, 1st Dispatch] It was recently reported that former US Ambassador to the Netherlands Hornbeck, who resigned last month, may succeed Leighton Stuart as Ambassador to China. However, according to sources from responsible parties here, this statement is extremely unfounded. The above rumor arose due to recent changes in US envoys to Europe and Hornbeck's visit to President Truman yesterday. It is understood that Hornbeck's (former Director of the Far East Division of the State Department and known as an expert on Chinese issues) visit to the President was purely a courtesy call, lasting only a few minutes. Since Hornbeck had not yet met with the President, he took the opportunity of returning to the country to pay a visit to the White House. It is understood that the State Department has no intention of making any changes to the Ambassador to China. There is no indication that Ambassador Leighton Stuart will resign, or that Washington intends to appoint a new Ambassador to China. According to sources from responsible parties, any changes to the US Ambassador to China will be determined by Secretary of State Marshall. However, as it stands, there is very little possibility of changes to the US Ambassador to China in the near future.

[Central News Agency, Changchun, 2nd Dispatch] The Changchun District Court today opened a three-judge collegiate panel for the case of Hao Yongde and others, the main culprits in the Wanbaoshan Incident, for the crime of robbery. After the presiding judge, Luo Feng, presented the record of the talks between the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Negotiation Office and the Japanese regarding the Wanbaoshan Incident in the 20th year of the Republic of China (1931), the main culprit Hao Yongde remained silent and no longer quibbled. The defendants Cao Yantu, Bian Bairen, Li Zhaohe, Liu Longhua, and Lin Zhentai all pleaded guilty without hesitation. Finally, the witnesses appearing in court separately described the events at the time and confronted Hao in court. They all believed that Hao was instigated by the Japanese behind the scenes, colluded with Koreans, and oppressed the people, causing the people to be dissatisfied and rise up in resistance, leading to the tragedy. The presiding judge then announced that the court would reconvene at a later date.
