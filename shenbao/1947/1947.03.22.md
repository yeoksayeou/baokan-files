[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 21st] The Third Plenum of the Central Executive Committee held its eighth and ninth sessions from 9:00 AM to 3:00 PM on the 22nd to discuss proposals and re-elect one-third of the Central Standing Committee members. Commissioners Chen Cheng and Chen Lifu will respectively serve as chairmen. Originally scheduled to close on the 22nd, the session will now be extended for several days.

[Our Newspaper, Nanjing, 21st] The Third Plenum of the Central Executive Committee convened its sixth meeting on the morning of the 21st. While continuing to review party affairs, in addition to expressing opinions and suggestions on general party affairs, personnel systems, and cadre training, Central Committee members Cui Zhenhua, Huang Yuren, and Jiao Yitang successively spoke, all agreeing that the Central Standing Committee should bear more responsibility in the future and possess decisive authority to share the heavy burden of daily affairs for the Director-General. In the afternoon, when discussing the method for re-electing Standing Committee members as proposed by the presidium, the committee members engaged in heated discussions, with more than twenty members speaking. They expressed various opinions on the one-third re-election method for the 36 Standing Committee members and whether they could be re-elected consecutively. As a result, it was decided to adopt a lottery method, and the twelve Standing Committee members to be re-elected would be selected through secret ballot. By this point, it was already 7:00 PM, and the eighth meeting, originally scheduled to convene at 8:00 PM on the 21st, was postponed to 9:00 AM on the 22nd.

Cheng believed that the Ministry of Finance had failed to adequately regulate the Central Bank and the Central Trust Bureau regarding the gold and currency crisis and requested Minister of Finance Yu Hongjun to attend the meeting to explain. Huang Yuren fully advocated for disciplinary action against corrupt officials, stating that personnel appointments within the party should be based on talent and ability and that military personnel without political capabilities should not be appointed as provincial governors to avoid harming local areas. The meeting adjourned at 12:00 noon.

Director-General Chiang Attends Seventh Session to Report

[Central News Agency, Nanjing, 21st] The Third Plenum of the Central Executive Committee held its seventh session at the National Assembly Hall at 3:25 PM on the 21st, with 258 members present. Commissioner Chen Guofu chaired the session. First, Director-General Chiang made a comprehensive report on party affairs, politics, economy, diplomacy, finance, and military affairs. After a ten-minute break at 4:40 PM, the discussion of matters began. The following two proposals were passed:

(1) Proposal to Postpone the Seventh National Congress.

The Sixth National Congress was convened in Chongqing on May 5, 1945. According to the General Regulations (held once every two years), the time for convening the next Congress has arrived. However, the elections in various local party branches have not yet been fully completed, and in accordance with the constitutional implementation preparation sequence, various elections will be held this year. Therefore, after deliberation by the presidium, it is proposed to postpone the Congress for one year in accordance with Article 27, Paragraph 2 of the General Regulations (when the Central Executive Committee encounters unavoidable circumstances, it may postpone the convocation of the regular session of the National Congress, but not for more than one year).

(2) Method for Re-electing Central Standing Committee Members. The Second Plenary Session decided that one-third of the 36 Central Standing Committee members would be re-elected at each plenary session. This session will implement this. The Presidium has prepared a method for re-election and submitted it for public decision and implementation: 1. A lottery method will be used to determine the order of the list of one-third of the Standing Committee members to be re-elected at each plenary session. 2. Those on the list to be re-elected at this session will be selected by this plenary session through secret ballot.

[United Press, Nanjing, 21st] Chairman Chiang, in his address at the Third Plenum on the 21st, reviewed diplomatic, economic, military, and political work item by item for seventy minutes, also pointing out the party's shortcomings and strengths. Chairman Chiang first discussed foreign policy, stating that the diplomatic policy towards the Soviet Union was completely correct and that friendly relations should be maintained with all countries. He further stated that the approval of Outer Mongolia's independence was a major achievement in the government's diplomatic efforts, that the Chinese people have always valued justice and trusted the right to self-government, therefore recognizing Outer Mongolia's independence as an achievement. In the economic realm, the crisis of last year had been overcome, the government had received enemy and puppet assets, obtaining large amounts of goods and gold, so the economy was no longer in danger of collapse, and he had confidence in American financial aid. The government, once it obtained the American loan, would use it to carry out national reconstruction work and would definitely not use it for fighting the Communist army. Militarily, the Chinese Communists had been continuously preparing for a war with the government for the past eight years, but recent events had proven that the Communist army could be defeated. Politically, the Kuomintang sincerely welcomed other parties to participate in the reorganization of the government. "We invite other parties to participate not as guests but on an equal basis to jointly promote the realization of the wish to return power to the people." The Kuomintang itself hopes that party members will make loyal and frank criticisms, not malicious attacks like those made by the enemy party.

### Northern Shaanxi Communist Army Attempts to Flee to Shanxi, Food in Suide and Qingjian Looted, No Trace of Communist Army in Suburbs of Yan'an

[Our Newspaper, Taiyuan, 21st] Amidst the nationwide celebrations of the recapture of Yan'an, the people of Shanxi are paying close attention to the increasingly serious situation in Shanxi. Several thousand family members of the Chinese Communists have recently and in the past crossed from northern Shaanxi to the east and moved to northwestern and southeastern Shanxi. There have been no reports of defeated troops fleeing into Shanxi, but it is only a matter of time. It is expected that Datong will be the first to be threatened. The Shanxi authorities are preparing to meet this serious situation.

[Associated Press, Nanjing, 21st] It is learned that all strategic points north, southeast, and southwest of Yan'an have been occupied by the National Army. The Communist Army is currently fleeing in different directions towards Suide and Qingjian. It is rumored that the Communist Army is currently crossing the Yellow River at Wubao, fleeing towards Lishi, Zhongyang, Shilou, Xingxian, Linxian, and Fangshan (all in western Shanxi). The headquarters of the Communist Army is located in a certain area in northern Shanxi.

[Our Newspaper, Xi'an, 21st] The Communist Army in the Shilou, Xixian, and Yonghe areas of southwestern Shanxi has been moving frequently in recent days, seemingly attempting to cross the Yellow River to reinforce the remaining Communists in northern Shaanxi.

[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 21st] After the National Army occupied Yan'an, it cleared out scattered Communist troops near the county seat. After two days and nights of searching, there was no trace of the Communist Army within 20 li around the Purple City.

[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 21st] In the Suide area, the Communist Army set up a transfer station every 30 li, with 200 civilian laborers assigned to each station to transport military supplies day and night. The food in Suide and Qingjian counties has been completely searched and looted. In Yonghe, the Communist Army has conscripted men aged 16 to 30 into militia teams, those aged 31 to 40 into stretcher teams, and those aged 45 to 50 into transportation teams.

[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 21st] While clearing the remains of Communist troops outside Yan'an, the bodies of Luo Yanping, brigade commander of the Communist Army's Second Education Brigade, and his chief of staff have been discovered. There are many other bodies of senior military officers, but due to the lack of symbols and belongings, it is difficult to confirm their names and positions. They are currently being identified by defecting Communist troops.

It is also learned that Luo was killed by the National Army in the Jinpenwan area north on the night of March 17.

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 21st] A small-sized newspaper here published a telegram from its special correspondent in northern Shaanxi, dispatched from Yan'an on the afternoon of the 20th, stating: (1) The National Army that recovered Yan'an began to advance in a fan shape in three directions—northwest, north, and southwest—from the morning of the 20th. The remaining Communist troops in Erzhai (formerly the mountain stronghold where Zhang Xianzhong gathered) in northern Yan'an fled to Anding. At 6:00 AM, they entered Liushui Gorge, the location of the Zhang Xianzhong Ancestral Hall. Qingjian can be captured in a matter of days. The Communist Army may resist stubbornly in Jiuli Mountain, north of Qingjian, relying on its dangerous terrain. The National Army advancing south from Yulin is also advancing towards Mizhi. The two armies may meet in Suide. (2) Since the afternoon of the 18th, the main force of the Communist Army has been crossing the Yellow River at Wubao, east of Suide, in hundreds of wooden boats, fleeing towards northwestern Shanxi. Under the suppression of aircraft, the situation is very embarrassing. (3) The Lyuliang Mountains area in northwestern Shanxi has become an important base for the Communist Army after its withdrawal from northern Shaanxi, but it will once again fall into the triangular position of the northern section of the Tongpu Railway and the National Army in northern Yanbei. (4) The reporter visited Liushui Gorge, the former residence of Zhang Xianzhong northeast of Yan'an, on the morning of the 20th. The area was built as an ancient Fushi during the Wanli reign of the Ming Dynasty. Because the Communist Party regarded Zhang as a peasant revolution hero, they built an ancestral hall for him with a large construction project. The horizontal plaque, "Zhang Xianzhong Ancestral Hall," was personally written by Mao Zedong. Most of the buildings were destroyed by artillery fire. Zhang's former residence was converted into a "Struggle Hall" by the Communist Party. He saw the corpses of two naked female Communist cadres hanging from the beams, a rather tragic scene. (5) Eight or nine out of ten buildings in Yan'an were destroyed. He personally saw an old woman with white hair cooking rice porridge to feed the National Army and saw National soldiers wrapping wounds for Communist soldiers, taking the milk from their bodies, diluting it, and pouring it into the mouths of Communist soldiers. (6) Among the more than 10,000 defecting Communist troops, there are approximately 1,000 female cadres and students, all wearing gray military uniforms. The military authorities have decided to pay each defecting Communist soldier one month's salary according to their rank. Those who hand over a rifle will receive a bonus of 100,000 yuan, and those who hand over a machine gun will receive 300,000 yuan.

[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 21st] After the National Army entered Yan'an, the Xian (yang)-Yu (lin) Highway, the main transportation route in northern Shaanxi, is expected to be opened to Yan'an. However, the Luochuan-Yan'an section has not been in operation for a long time, and the roadbed along the line has been completely destroyed by the Communist Army. The Shaanxi Provincial Highway Bureau has organized an emergency engineering team since the 21st, carrying tools, to rush north from Yaoxian to repair it and plans to set up stations for traffic.

### Post-War Measures for Northern Shaanxi Planned, Zhu Shaozhou Says He Will Personally Visit Counties to Console

[Central News Agency, Xi'an, 21st] After the National Army recovered Yan'an, a Central News Agency reporter specially visited Zhu Shaozhou, chairman of the Shaanxi Provincial Government, to inquire about his views. Zhu answered each question as follows:

Question: After the liberation of Yan'an, what are the provincial government's post-war plans for the counties in northern Shaanxi?

Answer: This government has formulated key points for emergency measures based on the various decrees of the pacification zone promulgated by the central government. There are concise regulations on the civil affairs, finance, education, construction, land administration, and food for the recovered counties. I have also telegraphed the commissioners, instructing them to take six important measures in the recovered areas within this year: (1) Exempting land taxes; (2) Suspending the conscription of soldiers; (3) Prohibiting various arbitrary levies; (4) Prohibiting the use of all illegal banknotes; (5) Encouraging the people to love and help each other and strictly prohibiting all acts of revenge; (6) The land currently under cultivation should continue to be cultivated as before. If there are disputes, they will be resolved according to law later, and spring plowing must be supervised and initiated to avoid missing the farming season. As for medical and relief matters in the recovered areas, the Health Department has been instructed to organize medical rescue teams to handle medical affairs. In terms of relief, in addition to allocating funds from this government to handle emergency relief, I have also telegraphed the central government requesting a large amount of money to be allocated for relief and compensation to ensure that the people can live and work in peace as soon as possible.

Question: Has the provincial government dispatched local administrative personnel to the recovered areas?

Answer: Cadres have been selected and dispatched separately.

Question: Will the provincial government send a special envoy to console the recovered counties?

Answer: I and Chiang, the Director of the Department of Civil Affairs, will personally visit the recovered areas in the shortest possible time to console the people.

Question: What are the chairman's impressions of the recapture of Yan'an this time?

Answer: Yan'an has been occupied by the Chinese Communists for thirteen years. Not only is it the manufacturing center for all plans that harm the country and the people, but it is also the base for planning opium cultivation and drug production. This time, the National Army's recapture is a great blessing for the people of Shaanxi. However, there is one point that the Chinese Communists should deeply reflect on, that is, the country should seek progress in peaceful construction. The dream of seizing power by force should be awakened as soon as possible to avoid causing unnecessary suffering to the people.

### Where is Mao Zedong? Possibility of Flying to Harbin

### Hu Shi Will Not Take Office

[Our Newspaper, Beiping, 21st] Chairman Chiang sent a letter to Hu Shi a decade ago, but its contents remain a mystery. It is thought that the letter was forwarded by Mayor He. When the letter arrived, Hu had already gone to Beijing. Chairman Chiang asked at the banquet of the China Education Foundation whether Hu had received the letter. Now Hu has returned to Beiping, and He Siyuan, the person who forwarded the letter, has also gone to Nanjing. Hu told reporters that he has no intention of taking office at present because it will take at least four years to make the university successful, and he has only been at the school for eight months. He answered questions about international intervention in China, saying that foreigners do not understand China and often do not scratch the itch. Answering the question of how China can achieve peace, he said, "It takes two good to make one good." A Western proverb also says that it takes two sides to make peace. (Please refer to page five)

[U.S. Information Service, Washington, 20th] President Truman today submitted a request to the Senate for approval of the Sino-American Treaty of Friendship, Commerce, and Navigation, and submitted this request to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. The President's statement was accompanied by a report from Acting Secretary of State Acheson regarding the treaty. The Acting Secretary of State stated: "The attached treaty aims to provide a broad legal framework for Sino-American relations. I believe that this treaty is an appropriate foundation for developing cultural, commercial, and trade relations that are mutually beneficial to both countries." Acheson also stated: "I hope this treaty will meet all the needs arising from current international relations issues and customs, especially changes in economic and commercial practices." He stated that the treaty contains more extensive and modern provisions than previous commercial treaties, and he categorized the treaty's articles as follows: (1) rights of individuals and companies, (2) exchange of goods, (3) navigation, (4) general affairs.

Since Japan's surrender, in addition to assisting China in recovering the occupied areas, the total amount of U.S. aid to China has exceeded $1.5 billion. Acheson continued: The situation in China is not that the Chinese government is about to face overthrow, while the plight of Greece is indeed in imminent danger. He strongly stated that the Chinese people voluntarily requested the creation of a new government that accommodates representatives from the Communist-controlled areas. He recounted that during his tenure as President's Special Envoy to China, Marshall had advocated that the Chinese government find ways to expand its representation.

Although the goals were the same, the opinions differed. At that time, it was decided to appoint representatives to form a review subcommittee to review these proposals so that they could reach a common point of view and create a concrete and permanent plan as the target for government reorganization. However, this action is separate from the submission of lists of names by the various parties and should not be confused. The review subcommittee met at Wu Dingchang's residence at 5:00 p.m. on the 21st. Attendees included Mo Dehui, Chen Bulei, Shao Lizi, Zhang Lisheng, Zuo Shunsheng, Li Huang, Li Daming, and Jiang Yuntian. Mo chaired the meeting, which adjourned at 9:00 p.m. Each party carefully studied the three proposals.

It is reported that Zhang Junmai will come to Nanjing on the 22nd and will also participate in the discussion. The meeting may continue for several days. It is learned that the Democratic Socialist Party's proposal is the two items that Jiang Yuntian submitted to the chairman some time ago. The points listed in the content are nothing more than (1) resolving the Kuomintang-Communist problem through political means, (2) thoroughly implementing democracy in politics, (3) eliminating excessive taxes in finance, (4) revitalizing diplomacy and strengthening friendly relations with various countries, and (5) designating specific uses for foreign loans. The Youth Party's views are also to improve diplomatic relations, protect the people's freedom and rights, and alleviate the people's suffering.

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 21st] At today's meeting of representatives from the Kuomintang, Democratic Socialist Party, Youth Party, and social figures, the steps for reorganizing the government were discussed and decided, first reorganizing the National Government Committee and then the Executive Yuan, and it is expected to be completed before the end of the month.

### Shanghai Coal Merchants Urge the Government to Quickly Improve the Control of Coal Sources

Petition Representatives Receive Reporters in Nanjing

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 21st] Xie Hengting and the other seven representatives of the Shanghai Coal Merchants Association petition group received reporters from various newspapers in Nanjing this afternoon, appealing to the government to improve the control of coal sources so that the 1,196 coal shops and more than 200,000 employees in Shanghai would not be cut off from their livelihood.

In addition, the executors often had the fact of issuing inflated allocations, and did not take into account those who used coal as fuel on a daily basis, which led to the creation of a black market. The coal merchants came to Nanjing this time, hoping that the government could improve the unreasonable state of allocation, and at the same time reallocate the excess coal allocated to various factories to the coal merchants, or allocate 25,000 tons per month to save the livelihood of the coal merchants. It is reported that after they petitioned the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, and others, Minister Wang Yunwu has agreed to consider it.

### Director of Land Administration Zheng Zhenyu Discusses: Plan for Reorganizing the Yellow River Flood Area; Methods for Topographic Surveying and Land Rights Reorganization are Drafted

[This Newspaper, Nanjing, 21st] After the closure of the Huayuankou breach, the urgent task at hand is the reorganization of the flooded area. A reporter from this newspaper recently visited Zheng Zhenyu, Director of the Land Administration, to inquire about the plan and implementation period of this work. He said: The total area of the flooded area is 270 million mu, half of which needs government assistance for reorganization. The work plan has been drafted with the relevant agencies and authorities, and it consists of two major items: (1) topographic surveying, (2) land rights reorganization. The former is easier to carry out, but it will not be possible until the second half of this year; the latter is more difficult to handle, but the current method decided is roughly as follows: (1) The original landowners' contracts should be used as the basis for dividing the land, but it is not necessary to follow the designated location in the original contract; (2) The land in the Yellow River flooded area is mostly covered with deep-rooted weeds and cannot be cultivated in a short period of time. It has been decided to use UNRRA machinery to cultivate the land, and then hand it over to the farmers for cultivation after it is mature; (3) After surveying and distribution, there will be surplus land, and the land with no owner may account for one-third. The government can use it as a public farm and as the center of agriculture, water conservancy, education, sanitation, security, and politics in the nearby rural areas. Establish a reclamation area management office, and set up this kind of public farm widely in various regions, which will also become a town. According to Zheng, the implementation period of this plan depends on the technical assistance of UNRRA. However, UNRRA will end its work in August of this year, while the branch offices in the flooded area will continue to work for a considerable period of time until the relief work is completed.

### Lu Salt is Being Exported to Japan

MacArthur Allocates Ships to Depart from Tanggu

[This Newspaper, Beiping, 21st] Salt industry news: Lu salt is being exported to Japan. The transportation tools are ships allocated by MacArthur, departing from Tanggu. It is reported that the price is lower than the market price, which is 210 yuan per catty. According to people in the salt industry, salt tax accounted for 70% of the national tax revenue last year. The salt production in the north is very abundant, and it is almost impossible for salt merchants to hoard it, so the salt price itself has not fluctuated. Each adjustment of the salt price is due to the salary increase of public officials, because the salaries of public school teachers and staff across the country are paid from the salt tax.

### The Necessity of Quickly Planning for the Aftermath of the Yellow River Flood Area

The closing project of the Yellow River's Huayuankou breach was successfully completed on the 15th of this month; this major event relating to the safety of the four provinces of Jiangsu, Shandong, Anhui, and Henan was successfully completed. The news came, and the four provinces were pleased. The Third Plenary Session of the Central Committee, which is being held in the capital, sent a telegram to commend the employees of the closing project, which is enough to show the importance of the Yellow River closing project to the national economy and the people's livelihood!

The Yellow River is China's main waterway. Its history is as long as the Chinese nation. Since Yu guided the river successfully, the river has not been harmful. There were times of prosperity during the Han and Tang Dynasties. During the Five Dynasties, the Yellow River had a trend from north to east, and during the Song Dynasty, it had a trend from east to south. By the time of the Jin and Yuan Dynasties, its trend became increasingly southward and could not be controlled. Every time the Yellow River breached, it would overflow thousands of miles, and life and property would suffer the same catastrophe, and the national vitality would suffer great damage. Therefore, the Yellow River has the reputation of being "China's sorrow." Therefore, in the past, when the Yellow River breached, all the power of the world would be exhausted to block it. Therefore, in addition to having a dedicated river management agency, river affairs and water conservancy also became an important administration for the officials of all dynasties who governed the people. When China's war of resistance against Japan broke out, the Yellow River breached at Huayuankou in June 1938. For nine years, it has deviated from its original course, and the land and people have been immersed in disaster. Houses and fields have been destroyed, and the disaster is unimaginable. According to statistics after the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the losses in the Yellow River flood area, only in the three provinces of Henan, Jiangsu, and Anhui, exceeded 13 million mu of cultivated land, and nearly one million people died. Those who did not die, the old and the weak were transferred to the ditches, and the strong were scattered in all directions, which is still incalculable. After the National Government returned, the Water Conservancy Commission and the UN Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) did their best to rescue the disaster and set up a blocking and restoration bureau, mobilizing a large number of manpower and technical experts, working hard day and night in the vast sandy wilderness, braving the biting wind, fighting the flood and competing with nature. The project lasted for a month, and finally celebrated its completion, since then the river flows eastward and returns to its original course. According to the Jinan telegram on the 20th, the headwaters of the Yellow River's old course have flowed through Shandong Province, and the Shandong people all have a feeling of reunion after a long separation. The refugees in the disaster areas of Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu can also return to their homeland and be able to return to farming. Therefore, it is said that the Yellow River's closing project is not only a blessing for the people, but also a blessing for the country. At the same time, we also believe that the government has done a major event that will enrich the country, benefit the people, and promote benefits and eliminate harm after its return.

The most dangerous periods of the Yellow River are the peach flood, the summer flood, the autumn flood, and the ice flood. Before the summer flood last year, the closing project was about to be completed, but the Chinese Communist Party suddenly raised the issue, requiring the closing project to be suspended for five months, sitting and watching the failure of the project and the recurrence of the tragic situation. At the end of last year, the government and the Chinese Communist Party negotiated the closing project issue, but the dispute was not settled, and the Yellow River's ice flood had already arrived. The dispute continued until February this year, when Xue Dubi, the director of the Water Conservancy Commission, reached an agreement with the Chinese Communist Party that the dike restoration work in the downstream CCP area should begin immediately, and the water conservancy had subsidized 4 billion yuan for the downstream dike restoration project; the closing project continued as usual and was completed in mid-March. According to the fact that the ice flood period is in the second month of spring and the peach flood period is in April, the people in the 34 counties of the flood area and the agricultural water conservancy technical experts all believe that March this year is the last critical moment for the compatriots. Closing the breach means life, and not closing the breach means death. The Closing and Restoration Bureau has gone through hardships and planned to start closing the breach on March 6, but due to the collapse of part of Huayuankou, a dangerous situation of foundation sinking occurred, and it was postponed to the evening of the 8th to start closing the breach. Because the water was turbulent and the waves were surging, millions of people threw stones to block the breach in the nick of time, and the closing project was completed on the 15th; the water flowed into the diversion canal and followed the old course. The people are still celebrating this major project of promoting benefits and eliminating harm, but China has once again raised objections, thinking that this matter has not been discussed jointly; regarding this point, Xue Dubi has also replied to Mr. Eggerton, the representative of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) in China. This small aftermath is a regret. The responsibility of the government and the officials in charge is to create benefits for the country and the people for thousands of years. If they abandon benefits and seek harm, and sit and watch the arrival of the peach flood, disregarding the life and death of the people, it is reckless. But from this, we can know that if the country wants to progress and construction to succeed, it must be unified and stable; otherwise, the Yellow River will be allowed to flow east if it breaches in the east, and flow west if it breaches in the west.

Now that the Yellow River's closing project has been completed, and the Third Plenary Session of the Central Committee has also sent a telegram to commend it, we will be able to celebrate the tranquility of the river. We believe that this achievement cannot be diminished. We hope that the government will reward the employees at all levels of the closing and restoration project in practical measures, especially foreign experts and our country's water conservancy technicians, and should give generous awards to encourage them. Gu Tinglin said: "There is no difficult achievement in the world, it depends on the person." It must be known that the completion of the Yellow River's closing project has exhausted the brains of technical experts and the blood and sweat of millions of people, so rewarding merits can also encourage the development of the people's construction psychology, which is related to the future of national construction. What is even more important is that the people in the Yellow River flood area have endured hardships for nine years and are still displaced in the sandy wilderness. How to make them return to their homeland, how to make them resume cultivation, and how to exempt them from military service and taxes all need the government to make a quick decision and quickly plan for the aftermath. Do not let this large flood area remain barren, and do not let the vast number of people remain helpless forever. If we imagine that today, in the central part of our country, there is a desert and a picture of refugees, wouldn't it be an endless harm? Today, after we celebrate the completion of the Yellow River's closing project, we believe that the aftermath of the Yellow River flood area is imminent and we must plan good strategies! We must quickly plan for the aftermath! In this way, the government's administration can be considered to have a beginning and an end! The vast number of people are all looking forward to it, hoping that the government will take on this responsibility and build up this happy land in the Central Plains!

### Acting Secretary of State Acheson Clarifies: U.S. Aid Policy to Greece and Turkey; Does Not Believe This Move Will Cause War; If the Freedom of Greece and Turkey Collapses, the Whole World Will Suffer

[United Press Washington 20th Dispatch] Acting Secretary of State Acheson provided supplementary opinions on President Truman's proposed aid to Greece and Turkey to the House Foreign Affairs Committee today. The wording was very cautious and deliberate. It is said that aiding Greece and Turkey to fight against communism will not cause war, but the U.S. government believes that the situations in Greece and China cannot be compared. If the House Foreign Affairs Committee cannot make a decision quickly, countries resisting communism may experience a series of reactions unfavorable to the United States. Acheson then revealed the following ten opinions to reporters: (1) Of the $400 million requested by Greece and Turkey, $300 million will be loaned to Greece, and the rest will be loaned to Turkey; (2) Additional funds are needed to maintain the status quo in southern Korea, the amount has not yet been determined, and the rumor of $500 million is absolutely inaccurate; (3) The government does not acknowledge that the situations in China and Greece are comparable. The Chinese Communist Party controls a large area of China, with its own government and army; (4) The United States does not intend to re-organize elections in Greece; (5) Aiding Greece and Turkey should not be regarded as an extension of the Monroe Doctrine to the whole world. The United States aids Greece and Turkey at the request of the governments of those countries, and is not interference; (6) It should not be assumed that the United States will implement the same policy in other countries; (7) From an economic or morale point of view, if Greece and Turkey collapse, the Eastern countries will be greatly affected. It is not an exaggeration to say that the countries from the Dardanelles to the Chinese territorial waters are closely watching the outcome of Greece and Turkey; (8) The people of Europe are struggling to repair the scars of war and strive to maintain freedom and independence, and are also closely watching the situation in Greece and Turkey; (9) The United States does not intend to send troops to fight the Greek guerrillas; (10) The United States aids Greece and Turkey because it does not dare to risk waiting for the United Nations to take action. Greece and Turkey currently have enough funds to import major items for only 14 days.

Acheson's speech was carefully worded and he tried his best to avoid directly involving the Soviet Union, but when he solemnly replied whether the government's plan would cause war, the meaning was very clear. He said: "I don't think it will cause war." When asked whether Turkey could rely on the United Nations to guarantee its national integrity, Acheson replied: "If you were a Turk, you would know that the United Nations has no army, and you would have to hesitate again and again about relying on it."

[United Press Washington 20th Dispatch] Acting Secretary of State Acheson presented multiple alarming confidential documents to the House Foreign Affairs Committee today when he predicted that President Truman's aid plan for Greece and Turkey would not cause a war with the Soviet Union, and distributed them to the committee members for reference. The document was in the form of a large loose-leaf notebook, explaining the background of the U.S. policy in the Mediterranean. Chairman Eaton of the committee advocated the publication of this confidential document, and four Republican members seconded it. Eaton told reporters: "The only way to deal with this document is to publish all the facts." Acheson will still attend the committee tomorrow to answer questions.

[Reuters Washington 20th Dispatch] The U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee is scheduled to begin hearing opinions on the aid to Greece and Turkey bill next Monday afternoon.

### U.S. to Expand Foreign Aid: Labor Secretary Reveals

[Associated Press San Francisco 20th Dispatch] Labor Secretary Schwellenbach stated in a speech at the Commonwealth Club today that the United States' aid to curb the development of communism may be extended to countries other than Greece and Turkey. Schwellenbach also said that President Truman firmly believes that if Greece and Turkey are not aided, the freedom of other countries will also tend to collapse, and communism will eventually dominate the world. Although Schwellenbach's words did not directly refer to the Soviet Union, the implied meaning is obvious. Schwellenbach continued: "Greece and Turkey may not be the only countries that actually need U.S. aid." But he did not specify which other countries they were. Before giving this speech, Schwellenbach had requested at a press conference that an amendment to the constitution be passed to outlaw the Communist Party in the United States.

### U.S. Seeks to Break U.S.-Soviet Stalemate in Korea; Plans to Establish Provisional Independent Government in South Korea; Policy Toward Korea to Undergo Thorough Change

[United Press Washington 21st Dispatch] According to well-informed sources, the military government in southern Korea is likely to be abolished and replaced by a provisional independent government in Korea. The current military governor, Hull, will be replaced by a civilian high commissioner. This is a thorough change in the U.S. policy toward Korea. When it will be implemented is not yet known, but according to various indications, it will probably be within a few months. Before Secretary of State Marshall departed for Moscow, it is said that he instructed the State Department to continue to explore the Korean situation and the U.S. policy toward Korea, with the aim of breaking the stalemate between the U.S. and the Soviet Union in Korea. The changes currently indicated, if implemented, would show that the State Department has quickly implemented Marshall's instructions and decided on a new policy. Although officials have not expressed anything about this omen so far, it can be asserted that the U.S. occupation army will remain stationed in Korea for the sake of maintaining security. Whether Lieutenant General Hodge, who is now in the United States, will return as the commander of the U.S. forces in Korea is still a question. If the adjustment is implemented, the position of military governor currently held by Major General Lerch will be abolished. Regarding the scope of changes in southern Korea, there are various reasons to believe that the United States will grant the provisional independent government actual sovereignty, and will only be supervised by a high commissioner. It is also expected here that the State Department will ask Congress to discuss the Korean issue immediately after passing President Truman's proposal to aid Greece and Turkey. The request will also include an appropriation of $200 million to deal with the military and economic situation in Korea. Once this new plan is implemented, it will be a complete victory for Syngman Rhee.

### American Observers Examine: Soviet Reaction to New U.S. Policy

[United Press Moscow 20th Dispatch] There is now a tendency among some Americans in Moscow to believe that President Truman's plan to aid Greece and Turkey, combined with the U.S.'s firm attitude at the Four Foreign Ministers Conference, has caught the Soviet Union off guard and made it retreat in the face of difficulties. Some even say that this firm attitude of the U.S. has been effective, and the Soviet attitude has softened. However, as far as the United Press's Moscow correspondent knows, things are not really like this. First, the Soviet Union is not easily intimidated; second, the Soviet Union probably has a very proactive line that it is following, and the Soviet Union will never participate in any conference with a passive plan; third, the Soviet Union sees clearly the signs of the real danger at hand.

### U.S. Returns Keflavik Airport

[Reuters Washington 21st Dispatch] The U.S. Army Air Forces has returned control of the Keflavik Airport to the Icelandic government, but U.S. military and civilian aircraft can still land there.

### Four Foreign Ministers' Conference Reviews: Austrian Problem Report; Bevin Will Propose Organizing German Federal Government

[Our Report] London 21st Broadcast: The four foreign ministers held their eleventh meeting today to hear the report submitted by the deputies' meeting on the Austrian issue.

[Our Report] London 21st Broadcast: According to well-informed sources, Bevin will propose that the future German government adopt the federal system of the United States and Canada. It is said that Bevin will make this suggestion after today's report from the deputies on the drafting of the Austrian peace treaty. The contents include a bicameral system and individual state governance, like the United States, but the executive power of the elected president is unique. It is expected that the United States and France will agree to this plan. The Soviet Union, which has always advocated the organization of a strong central government, is expected to oppose this suggestion.

[Agence France-Presse Tehran 20th Dispatch] A news agency quoted a dispatch from its Moscow correspondent saying that the four foreign ministers have agreed to allow Iran to participate in the German peace conference.

[Agence France-Presse Rome 21st Dispatch] The Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced today that Italy will participate in the negotiations for the German peace treaty, but it is not known whether it will only submit a memorandum or actually send representatives to attend the meeting.

### A Battle of Wits Between British and French Representatives

[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 20th] At today's tenth meeting of the four foreign ministers, French representative Bidault stated that increasing the quantity of German coal exported to France was a prerequisite for France to accept German economic unification reparations and improved industrial standards. British Foreign Secretary Bevin categorically rejected this, insisting that Germany must have sufficient coal for its own industrial needs so that Germany can eventually become self-sufficient and not require supplies from Britain and the United States. This has caused the foreign ministers' meeting to once again reach an impasse. US Secretary of State Marshall requested an immediate discussion of a temporary German organization, but Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov opposed it.

### Franco-Soviet Differences Not Entirely Resolved

[Agence France-Presse, Moscow, 21st] French Foreign Minister Bidault told reporters at the French Embassy here this morning: My recent conversation with Marshal Stalin was broad in scope and harmonious in spirit. Unfortunately, the time was too short to clarify all the points of disagreement, especially the two sides' attitudes towards a federal Germany, which are diametrically opposed. There are rumors that I will hold another meeting with Stalin, but I have no such plans at the moment. Regarding France's request to obtain German coal, Britain and France discussed this when negotiating the conclusion of the alliance, and there was hope of reaching an agreement soon, but so far the opinions of both sides are still not close. Foreign Secretary Bevin's attitude remains the same as it was last November. I have explained France's attitude to the French National Assembly. In short, I have no intention of yielding.

### Yugoslavia Receives No U.S. Relief Funds

[Central News Agency, Washington, 20th] The U.S. State Department announced to Yugoslavia today that the proposed $350 million in foreign relief funds will not be allocated to Yugoslavia, as these funds will only be allocated to the countries most in need.

### British Troops Must Remain to Safeguard the Security of the Middle East and Far East - Alexander States to the House of Commons

[Reuters, London, 20th] Defense Minister Alexander defended the government's defense plan in the House of Commons today, stating that the reduction of British troops at home and abroad will not be significant, and the conscription plan is necessary. The United Nations is still in its early stages, and major powers should not disarm. In the future, Britain does not intend to publish troop numbers, as the government believes that it is a mistake to implement pre-war public methods before an internationally agreed-upon policy of free exchange of information. The Middle East remains an important part of the British Commonwealth's security, and our country's legitimate needs in the region must be guaranteed. We do not intend to fully withdraw troops stationed in India before the end of June 1948. The Palestine issue has now been submitted to the United Nations for discussion, and British troops will continue to be stationed to maintain security until a resolution is reached. Alexander continued, stating that British troops will continue to be stationed in Hong Kong, Malaya, and other places, with the number based on the standard that their strength is sufficient to ensure the security and reconstruction of the area. The number of British troops currently stationed in Japan is limited, and the British troops in Indonesia have all withdrawn, he said.

### House of Lords Passes Motion Condemning the Government

Economic Policies Deemed Inappropriate

[United Press, London, 20th] The British House of Lords today passed a motion condemning the Labor government by a vote of 119 to 30, stating that it has not taken appropriate measures to deal with Britain's economic crisis. The voting in the House of Lords is different in nature from the voting in the House of Commons, so this condemnation will not lead to the overthrow of the Attlee cabinet, but only reflects the opinions of dissatisfied opposition nobles in the House of Lords expressing their anti-Labor views. This is the tenth condemnation by the House of Lords in this session of parliament, and the most serious one.

### French Cabinet Facing Major Crisis - Ramadier Has Notified the President to Seek a Successor - External Representatives Dispatched to Welcome Bidault Back Home

[Our Report] London, 21st Broadcast: French President Auriol is making a final effort with the leaders of various parties to save the current political crisis and prevent the government from collapsing, but unless there is an unexpected miracle, its collapse is almost inevitable. After meeting with the leaders of various parties, Prime Minister Ramadier delivered a speech at the Socialist Party Congress, saying that compromise is not yet hopeless.

[Reuters, Paris, 20th] France is once again facing a new cabinet crisis. It is heard that Prime Minister Ramadier has stated that if the Communist Party does not trust the government's Vietnam policy, he will resign. Communist leader Duclos has announced that the party will refuse to support the Vietnam military expenditure bill. With Parliament in this "showdown" situation, the bill has been postponed for further discussion until the 22nd. Ramadier has submitted a final notification to President Auriol, and according to the constitution, the president should seek a successor for prime minister. It is heard that Auriol is eager to find some basis for a reconciliation between the four parties to avoid the government breaking down due to anti-communist tendencies, which may lead to more serious consequences, even causing a general strike, which is also possible.

[United Press, Paris, 20th] French President Auriol consulted with the leaders of various political parties on the 20th to seek a compromise solution to the political crisis. Among the political party leaders who met with President Auriol was former Prime Minister Blum. There are rumors that if the Ramadier cabinet collapses, Blum may be invited again to form a purely Socialist Party government. The Communist Party's parliamentary group convened a meeting today.

[United Press, Paris, 21st] The French Foreign Ministry announced that it has dispatched representatives to Moscow to await in case of an emergency, so that Bidault, who is participating in the Four Foreign Ministers Conference, can be quickly brought back to France.

### The Socialist Party Attempts to Avert the Crisis - Decides to Change Vietnam Policy

[Agence France-Presse, Paris, 21st] The Central Committee of the French Socialist Party held a meeting yesterday and passed a resolution advocating that military measures in Vietnam should be limited to those necessary for maintaining security, and that negotiations should be conducted with representatives of the Viet Minh authorities at an opportune time. Both sides could implement a mutual ceasefire, and appoint officials who are committed to republicanism and democracy, etc. It is noted that the Communist Party's refusal to vote on the Vietnam military expenditure bill has led to the possibility of a cabinet crisis, so the Socialist Party passed this moderate resolution, aiming to prevent the current four-party coalition cabinet from breaking down.

### Viet Minh Representative in France Suddenly Arrested and Imprisoned

[Reuters, Paris, 20th] An army spokesman said that Tong Ba My, deputy head of the Viet Minh delegation in Paris, has been arrested and sent to the military prison in Paris by the military authorities, and has been interrogated by a military judge for several hours.

### U.S.-Soviet Confrontation - Japan's Position is Extremely Important

[United Press, New York, 20th] State Department officials today unanimously believe that although MacArthur has proposed an early completion of the peace treaty with Japan and the withdrawal of U.S. troops, the U.S. defense line has encircled the world from China, and the Pacific section is particularly important and there is no intention to weaken it. Acting Secretary of State Acheson has stated that due to technical reasons, the peace treaty with Japan had to be postponed, but in fact there are other reasons. The Soviet attitude now forces the United States to not only not relax, but even tighten its defense line. This line of defense, which the Soviet Union calls "encirclement," was an inaccurate term at the time, but is now becoming a reality. The U.S. and the Soviet Union face each other in Korea, Japan, the North Pacific, and Alaska. The recently signed U.S.-Canada joint defense agreement has completed this ring, from Greenland, the Kuril Islands to the U.K., and from Germany to the Mediterranean and Italy. Congressional action in the coming days is expected to link Greece, Turkey, and Iran. The U.S. has long encountered Soviet influence in Iran, and to some extent, has made it yield. Afghanistan, a buffer state between India and the Soviet Union, is not a true outpost, but the U.S. has considerable influence there, replacing Britain's original position to resist the Soviet Union. This line of defense is both political and military in nature, and is now mostly political in nature. Although the U.S. should remain in Japan for a long time to ensure its democratization, the Japanese islands are in the same position militarily in relation to the Asian continent as Britain is to the European continent. As long as Asia and Europe have the potential to trigger a world war, Japan, like Britain, will never lose its importance to U.S. national defense.

### U.S.-Philippine Military Agreement Formally Signed Yesterday

[United Press, Manila, 21st] The U.S.-Philippine military mutual assistance agreement was signed at 8:45 a.m. on the 21st at the Malacañang Palace in Manila, with Roxas and McNutt representing the two countries. It stipulates that the United States will send a military mission of 58 officers to guide the Philippine army and navy, and provide military equipment, including 83 ships. The agreement is revised every five years.

### Two Secretaries of the Pope Pass Away

[Agence France-Presse, Vatican City, 21st] Monsignor O'Connell, the Pope's private secretary, passed away suddenly this morning at the age of 79, only a few days after the death of his colleague Prince Colonna.

U.S. National Brookhaven Laboratory. This laboratory is jointly operated by nine famous universities in the east, funded by the government, and specializes in the peaceful uses of atomic energy. (Special dispatch from the New York Times)

### U.S. Advocates Early Consultation on Draft Peace Treaty with Japan

[United Press, Washington, 20th] According to government sources today, the State Department plans to consult with other countries on the drafting of a peace treaty with Japan in the near future. Government officials denied that this decision was due to MacArthur's recent statement, but pointed out that when Wenceslaus, chairman of the Allied Council for Japan, recently returned to the United States, the authorities informed him of this decision. Presumably Acheson has relayed this decision to MacArthur, so MacArthur issued the statement. The question now is which countries can participate in the drafting of the peace treaty, and which countries have the right to review it. Although U.S. officials hope that the eleven countries of the Far Eastern Commission should all participate in the drafting of the peace treaty with Japan, the Soviet Union will definitely oppose it. It is generally believed that the peace treaty with Japan will likely follow the precedent of the European peace treaties, with only four or five major countries undertaking the drafting of the peace treaty, and the remaining countries of the Far Eastern Commission reviewing it. Officials here also believe that after formal discussions begin, the completion of the peace treaty with Japan will take nine to twelve months.

### Security Council Meets to Discuss Corfu Channel Mine Incident - Two Blocs Confront Each Other, France Remains Neutral

[Our Report] San Francisco, 21st Broadcast: When the United Nations Security Council resumed discussion of the Corfu Channel mine incident today, Albanian representative Kapo reiterated that the Albanian government does not acknowledge prior knowledge of the existence of the mines. It is reported that the opinions of the representatives of various countries on this issue are divided. The representatives of the United States and four other countries are prepared to support Britain's accusations that the Albanian government deliberately planted illegal mines, destroying two British destroyers and killing 44 sailors. France and Syria remain neutral, or will abstain. The Soviet Union and Poland support Albania, arguing that Britain's accusations cannot provide evidence. Britain expects the Soviet Union to veto any prosecution by the Security Council, so it has suggested that the case be transferred to the International Court of Justice for handling.

### Various Spanish Parties Plan Restoration - Guerrillas in Mining Areas Are Quite Active

[United Press, Lisbon, 20th] It was learned here today that the Spanish Royalist Party, Conservative Party, and Catholic Party recently held several important meetings in Estoril. Former King Don Juan also participated in the meetings. The meetings decided to discuss the restoration with the exiled Republican government. The suggestions and resolutions of the meetings will not be made public, but will be sent separately to the Royalist Party and the Catholic Party in Spain, emphasizing the need for a consensus when rebuilding the empire and establishing a government recognized by foreign countries. Don Juan decided to restore the empire after a referendum, and to cooperate with a freely elected parliament to rule Spain in accordance with the provisions of the liberal constitution.

[Reuters, Madrid, 20th] Conflicts with guerrillas occur frequently in the Teruel region, 300 miles east of Madrid. Nine guerrillas were killed and 40 were captured. The authorities also announced that during the festival celebrations in Valencia this week, the guerrillas planned to disrupt the festivities with bombs, but fortunately the authorities uncovered the conspiracy in advance, preventing a major disaster. Guerrillas are also active on the Valencia highway.

(5) The Shanghai Consumer Cooperative requested that the oil, sugar, and salt items in the city's distribution be handled by the cooperative. This should be limited to members of the cooperative who are public and parochial school personnel, and a clear list should be prepared to avoid duplication.

In order to maintain close contact with the agencies requesting subsidies, the Review Committee hopes that agencies with unclear addresses or those who have not reported their addresses will promptly report them to facilitate distribution.

### Public Assets of Former Two Concessions Illegally Sold by Puppet Government - Municipal Council Meeting Passes Resolution to Reclaim Them All with Public Announcement

[Our Report] The illegal sale of public assets of the former two concessions in this city by the puppet Shanghai Special Municipal Government. The Municipal Council meeting has now resolved that a public announcement will be made to reclaim them from today, and they will be included as municipal public assets. The title deeds left outside will also be declared invalid by public announcement. Regarding the public assets illegally sold by the puppet municipal government, the Land Bureau has completed the investigation based on relevant archives. Most of those belonging to the former Public Concession were purchased by Japanese enemies. Except for a part of the 13 plots of land at No. 18 Zezu, Map 5 in Huangpu District, all are now taken over and used by the Health, Education, and Public Works Bureaus. The bureau has sent a letter to the former Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui District Enemy and Puppet Property Handling Bureau, asking them not to treat them as enemy property for disposal. Those belonging to the former French Concession were all purchased and resold by Yongfeng and Xinhe companies. According to the regulations on clearing land rights in recovered areas promulgated by the Executive Yuan, the above-mentioned public assets are all invalid.

### Stipulating Three Principles - Stall Locations - 353 Locations

[Our Report] In order to take into account the livelihood of the common people, the Municipal Council passed a motion at its second general meeting, "Please the Municipal Government to promptly designate stall locations," which was sent to the Municipal Government for handling. After receiving the order, the Police Bureau convened a meeting with the Public Utilities Bureau and representatives of the Municipal Council to discuss and determine three principles: (1) The area occupied by each stall should be limited to 4 Chinese feet in length and 3 Chinese feet in width. (2) Stalls are not allowed during the day in the Huangpu and Laozha districts. Stalls are allowed on non-traffic roads and in various alleys, provided that they do not hinder traffic and fire prevention. (However, the establishment of stalls in alleys must obtain the consent of the residents, and the Police Bureau must investigate and confirm that it does not hinder traffic and fire prevention). (3) The 353 stall locations in the city originally surveyed by the Police Bureau are still appropriate and do not need to be changed. This was passed at the 70th Municipal Council meeting yesterday and sent to the Municipal Council. The location of outdoor vegetable stalls must be designated.

### Barber Stalls Not Allowed in Huangpu and Laozha Districts

The location of outdoor vegetable stalls must be designated.

[Our Report] The Municipal Council meeting decided yesterday that barber stalls are not allowed in the Huangpu and Laozha districts of this city. Barber stalls are also not allowed along the roads in other districts, but a part of the open space in the stall concentration areas is allowed to be designated specifically for barber stalls. In addition, the vacant spaces in the fixed vegetable markets should be used as much as possible to absorb vegetable vendors to move in. Outdoor vegetable stalls should be moved to nearby open spaces. If there is indeed no open space there, the Police and Health Bureaus may designate stalls to be set up on wide roads more than 300 yards away from the vegetable market, provided that they do not hinder traffic.

### Shangsong Line Ferry Increases Prices - Residents of Pudong Request Correction

[Our Report] Residents of Jinjiaqiao Town, Pudong, Zhou Mo, etc., recently submitted a petition to the Municipal Council, stating that the Shangsong Line ferry has increased prices in disguise, and requesting a prompt correction. Their reasons are roughly as follows: The ticket price for the Shangsong Line ferry from Shanghai to Qingning Temple was originally 500 yuan for second class, 1,000 yuan for first class, and 1,500 yuan for special class. However, starting from February 26th, a fuel surcharge of 10% was suddenly added to the ticket price. This move is obviously inconsistent with the emergency economic measures announced by the government on February 17th. The workers residing in Pudong are deeply affected, so they request that the Municipal Government be ordered to correct this.

### The District Procuratorate Decides Not to Prosecute the China National Aviation Corporation Crash in Western Hubei - Investigations by All Parties Determine That It Was Beyond Human Rescue

[Our Report] After China National Aviation Corporation's C-46 No. 145 passenger plane on the Shanghai-Chongqing route crashed in Tianmen County, Western Hubei on January 28th of this year, rumors spread that the cause of the crash was that the screws of a certain important part of the plane were removed, or that 200 bars of gold were smuggled in the wings, causing the plane to lose balance and crash. The District Court of this city believed that since the plane took off in this city, if the above-mentioned criminal acts occurred, they should be under the jurisdiction of the court in this city, and assigned Prosecutor Liu Yongzhi of the District Procuratorate to be responsible for the investigation. Prosecutor Liu believed that Wu Shi (American), director of the Aviation Group of China National Aviation Corporation, and Deputy Directors Chen Hongsi and Wang Zhu were responsible for the command and supervision of aviation matters. They were responsible for the overall inspection of aircraft parts and personnel before each flight, as well as the verification of intelligence on obstacles encountered en route. If the aircraft crashed and a dereliction of duty was found, the aviation director should be held criminally liable, so the prosecutor interrogated Wu Shi, Chen Hongsi, and Wang Zhu. According to Wu Shi, the plane was thoroughly re-inspected before takeoff, and it was not found that "the screws of important parts were removed." There were no gold bars in the wings except for the fuel tank. He especially emphasized that even if the plane carried 70 kilograms of gold, it would not cause the plane to lose balance, and even if the plane lost balance, it would not crash. According to the investigation report from the company's Hankou office, the aircraft parts were normal and the weather was good when the aircraft took off from Shanghai to Hankou and from Hankou. According to an expert investigation report, the cause of the crash was a fire in the left engine, which burned off the left wing, and the pilot did not have time to land, resulting in the crash. This kind of accident was beyond human rescue and could not be foreseen. It was inevitable and almost certain. Therefore, the responsible positions of Wu Shi and the other two were not negligent. In addition to separate administrative procedures for the supervisory failures, it is difficult to impose criminal liability for negligent homicide. Therefore, in accordance with Article 231, paragraph 10 of the Criminal Procedure Law, a decision not to prosecute was made.

### China National Aviation Corporation to Conduct Second Test Flight on U.S.-China Air Route

[Our Newspaper News] The case of Shen Weiting, a major tobacco merchant in Shanghai, accused of being a traitor, was concluded yesterday at the High Court, with sentencing scheduled for the morning of the 27th. According to the indictment from the High Procuratorate, the defendant had been engaged in the tobacco industry in Shanghai for more than 30 years. Since 1934, he had served as the chairman of the Shanghai Cigarette Factory Trade Association. During the Japanese occupation of Shanghai, the association was reorganized into the "Shanghai Special City Cigarette Industry Association" by order of the puppet regime, and the defendant continued to serve as "Chairman of the Board of Directors." Later, he was appointed as "Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Central China Tobacco Allocation Cooperative" by the puppet regime. During his tenure in the puppet position, he was used by the enemy to harm the people, and the list of his crimes is endless. After the victory, he was reported by Xu Liusheng, arrested, and brought to justice. Shen claimed during yesterday's interrogation: "In order to maintain the overall tobacco industry in the city, I had no choice but to take on the puppet position." He also hired a lawyer to defend him.

### Zhou Gengsheng Died in Prison, High Court Summons Witnesses, Source of Strange Note Still Unknown

[Our Newspaper News] Zhou Gengsheng, a suspected traitor, also known as Zhou Gengsheng or Zhou Kui, 35 years old, from Rufou, Jiangsu, died in the High Court detention center. A "strange note" was found in his pocket, demanding 35 gold bars. The High Court paid close attention to this matter. Yesterday afternoon, the co-defendants Kan Chunyang and Ren Tianfu, who were in custody, were interrogated, and witnesses Zhu Jinbang and Zhang Shuchun, representatives of the Railway Association, Zhou Hongye, Zhou's father, and Lin Yizhi, who was in the same cell, were summoned to testify in court.

Based on the consolidated statements of the witnesses, the background of the case was the competition for the contract for all loading and unloading work at the Rihui Port Station on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway, because this contracting work had a very high income, so they spared no effort to compete. Before the war, Wolffolin was the contractor. When the war broke out, Japanese planes bombed Rihui Port Station severely, and Wolffolin was afraid and fled. Subsequently, Zhou Gengsheng, Kan Chunyang, Ren Tianfu, and others contracted the work, engaging in military transportation at the time, and were praised by the Railway Transportation Command. After the victory, Wolffolin still intended to contract the work and launched a denunciation.

Launched a denunciation

, before August of last year, there was a roster at the Transportation Department of the two Railway Bureaus. Among them, it was pointed out that Zhou Gengsheng and others were suspected of being traitors. Although the plaintiffs in this case were Quan Changsheng and Quan Senlin, the instigator was Wolffolin. As for Zhou's father, Zhou Hongye, he did not seem to know much about the "strange note." He arrived at court yesterday and stated: "After my son Zhou Gengsheng died, in grief and anger, I burned all the notes he wrote during his lifetime." Although Judge Qiu sternly admonished him, he avoided making

direct answers

. Lin Yizhi, who was in the same cell, said: Zhou was from northern Jiangsu, and I am from Hangzhou. Because our languages are different and he was sick, although we were in the same room, we never talked. After questioning up to this point, the source of the "strange note" is still unknown. In order to understand the situation of this case, the reporter visited the person in charge of the High Court detention center, who provided the following information. Zhou Gengsheng had suffered from heart disease for a long time. The detention center had asked a doctor from the prison hospital to treat him. Because of his heart disease, he could not be moved to the ward and died in his cell at around 4:00 AM on the 19th. At that time, the prisoners on each floor were

noisy

, and the order was disrupted. Later, 16 representatives were selected to present Chen, the warden, with demands for improved treatment. All of Zhou Gengsheng's letters and notes left after his death were presented to Warden Chen by the prisoners, so the source of this "note" cannot be speculated. In order to maintain prison discipline, the mail was suspended for one day the day before yesterday, and mail delivery has resumed as usual since yesterday. The issue of whether bail should be granted when the patient is seriously ill is not within the authority of this detention center, so the various speculations about this detention center are supported by facts, and we do not wish to make any further statements.

### Preliminary Hearing of the Fuxing Island Case of Stealing and Selling Materials, Four Defendants Vehemently Deny, Court Discussion Adjourned for Retrial, Niu Chunling Summoned for Confrontation

[Our Newspaper News] The District Court held the first trial yesterday morning regarding the portion of the Fuxing Island case involving the alleged theft and sale of enemy military materials. The defendants are Li Yunpeng, Wang Songqian, Jin Zhensheng, and Wang Kui, who were prosecuted by the prosecutor. In addition to the four defendants, witnesses Wang Qianli, Han Shengrong, Wang Enqing, and Hu Genhua were also summoned to testify in court. According to the first defendant, Li Yunpeng, Chief of the Affairs Section of the Fishery Management Office of the Executive Yuan, Wang Songqian, Jin Zhensheng, and Wang Kui were not introduced by him. At that time, Platoon Leader Niu Chunling of the Navy was responsible for security and other work on the island. As for whether Niu stole and sold materials on the island, he had no way of knowing. Although there were many materials left by the Japanese army on the island, as he was not in charge, he could not know the details, let alone obtain them. After Niu Chunling was detained, he did not go to visit him (according to the prosecutor's indictment, Li has admitted to visiting him), and he did not send gold bars or anything like that. The two bathtubs were discovered by worker Wang Kui when he was repairing water pipes, and they contained only dirt and no gold. The other three defendants also denied any collusion to steal and sell materials. During the court's inquiry, witness Wang Qianli stated that he was a specialist committee member and director of the technical office of the Agricultural Committee of the Executive Yuan, and also one of the defendants in the suspected case. The prosecutor believed that he had committed perjury, but due to the amnesty, he was declared not to be prosecuted. According to Wang, the four defendants in this case were all introduced by him. Li Yunpeng and he were 15-year-old friends, so it was clear that this case was not denounced by him. The prosecutor thought that he could not serve as the director of the Fishery Management Office, and therefore attempted to disrupt things, which was a misunderstanding. Because the position of director of the technical office was almost the same as that of director of the Fishery Management Office, or perhaps the prosecutor misunderstood the words of Xu Fuqi, the director of the Fishery Management Office, which contained a tendency to engage in infighting. He also guaranteed that Li Yunpeng was honest and had no corrupt behavior. Another witness, Han Shengrong, stated that he was a painter and knew Xu Guangcai. He bought lead sheets from Ma Jiliang through Xu's introduction, and he did not know that the lead sheets were stolen goods from Fuxing Island. He also did not know Niu Chunling at all. The court ordered that Niu Chunling be summoned from the Naval Military Law Office to confront the defendants, and adjourned the hearing for retrial. In addition to the original bail, the defendants Li Yunpeng and others each paid a written guarantee of 50 million yuan.

Liang and others allegedly coerced former Customs Commissioner Bailicha and deliberately shielded him, and there were also allegations of collusion. The case was transferred by Jianghai Customs to the District Procuratorate for investigation. The investigation has now been concluded, and it is believed that there is no evidence of a crime by the 13 defendants, including Liang Huajie and others. The prosecutor has decided not to prosecute in accordance with Article 231, Paragraph 10 of the Criminal Procedure Law.

### "Four Famous Mountains" Bandit Gang Trial Concluded, Liu Hangxia Claims He was Forced by Livelihood, Liu Huaide Does Not Admit to Being an Accomplice

[Our Newspaper News] The "Four Famous Mountains" bandit gang Liu Hangxia, Liu Huaide, and Zhang Zhiqing, after being prosecuted by the District Procuratorate, underwent their first trial yesterday morning. According to Liu Hangxia's confession, he used to be a clerk in the Aviation Committee. After losing his job, he resorted to theft for a living and committed six crimes successively. Liu Huaide confessed that he and Liu Hangxia were once colleagues and had worked in the Political Department of the 14th Army.

He met Liu Hangxia in Yichang, and they came to Shanghai together to seek employment, living together in the Huizhong Hotel.

After the interrogation by Judge Zhu Yuhuang, he adjourned the trial and scheduled the sentencing for the morning of the 28th. The portion of the case involving the defendant Zhang Zhiqing has been rescheduled for a separate trial because the criminal is mute and cannot be interrogated normally.

[Our Newspaper News] Jin Di, 17 years old, also known as A Xiang, the adopted daughter of tea merchant Zhu Changqing at No. 30 Zhongshi New Village, Yuyuan Road, was originally from Ningbo. She was abducted to Shanghai at the age of 11 during the War of Resistance and was intended to be sold to a brothel as a prostitute. Because Zhu had no children, he bought her as an adopted daughter. Unexpectedly, the girl's temperament changed drastically since last year, and she became disobedient. On the 11th day of the first lunar month, she accidentally broke two glass cups and was scolded by Zhu several times, and then ran away.

### Reader Consultation Medical and Health

(1) Chest Pain

Wang Ming asks: I had an X-ray examination three or four months ago, and the doctor said that my lungs were good, but there was an old scar in the upper part of my left lung, and I should pay attention to rest. I have two questions: Please advise (1) I have never had lung disease, so why is there a scar on my lung? Is there a significant difference between early active pulmonary tuberculosis and an old scar when taking an X-ray? (2) Is the occasional chest pain related to this scar? (3) Due to work reasons, I cannot rest, what effective drugs should I take, is fish liver oil pills beneficial?

[Answered by Dr. Gu Yuqi, Doctor of Medicine] Based on your letter, it is best to take an X-ray photo, because fluoroscopy is still difficult to accurately diagnose. If the X-ray photo determines that there is no active tuberculosis, then the occasional chest pain is intercostal neuralgia. Multiple vitamin pills can be taken regularly.

(2) Multiple Diseases After Childbirth

He Qiren asks: My relative is 17 years old, female, married, and in good health. Unexpectedly, she had a difficult labor in June of this year, and the fetus was suffocated in her belly. Later, the child was taken out by surgery, so she could escape the danger, but her uterus was thus ulcerated, and she could not control urination, which was incessantly dripping, and there was also a vaginal flatus phenomenon, which was extremely painful. I don't know what disease it is, please answer.

[Answered by Dr. Gu Yuqi, Doctor of Medicine] Your relative's disease must be thoroughly examined before a treatment plan can be determined, and surgery may be required.

### Ministry of Education's Higher Education Department and Others Are Currently Discussing Streamlining Procedures for Applying for Publicly Funded Education and Changing the Application Time to Earlier

[Our Nanjing, 21st Dispatch] The Ministry of Education, considering that the laws and regulations for students in national schools applying for publicly funded education are overly complex, with more than ten types, including repetitions, temporary measures, and those that have expired, urgently needs to be reorganized and simplified. It has been decided that the Counselor's Office, the General Affairs Department, the Higher Education Department, and the Secondary Education Department will discuss the measures, with He Shijun, director of the General Affairs Department, as the convener. It is reported that the principles of the revision are to simplify the laws and regulations, streamline the procedures for applying for publicly funded education, and bring forward the application time, so that applications can be made after passing the entrance examination and being admitted. Currently, applications for publicly funded education must be made after enrollment, and often it takes one or two months to receive the funding, greatly affecting students' motivation to study.

### Chairman Chiang Approves a Five-Fold Increase in Professors' Academic Research Funding

[Our Nanjing, 20th Dispatch] The academic research subsidies for teachers at national colleges and universities have been previously approved, with 50,000 yuan for professors, 40,000 yuan for associate professors, 30,000 yuan for lecturers, and 20,000 yuan for teaching assistants. However, due to recent price increases and currency devaluation, these amounts are insufficient. To improve the quality of university education and stabilize academic research life, the Ministry of Education specially submitted a proposal to Chairman Chiang on the 6th of this month, requesting an additional amount. The standard is a uniform increase of five times the original amount, i.e., 250,000 yuan for professors, 200,000 yuan for associate professors, 150,000 yuan for lecturers, and 100,000 yuan for teaching assistants. The proposal has been approved by the Chairman, and a notification will be issued to all schools for application once the Executive Yuan designates the source of funds.

### Tsinghua After Restoration (Middle)

— Mei Yiqi

The College of Agriculture was established last autumn, and it was difficult to find suitable buildings on campus. Fortunately, the Ministry of Education allocated the buildings of the Enemy Puppet-established Civil Engineering College (east of the Summer Palace) for repairs, which can be used temporarily.

The student dormitories, Xin, Ping, Shan, and Ming Halls, have a total of 568 rooms. Originally designed for two people per room, it is indeed more suitable for two people. However, due to the increase in students, they have been changed to accommodate three people, totaling more than 1,780 people. The rooms originally prepared for workers have also been occupied, and the crowded situation can be imagined by alumni who have lived in these dormitories. Jing Hall, the girls' dormitory, has a total of 68 rooms, originally for two people per room, and has also been changed to accommodate three people, totaling 200 people. For those who cannot be accommodated in the above dormitories, more than 50 boys are temporarily living downstairs in a hospital building, and 40 girls are living in Guyue Hall. As for the dormitory facilities, except for the iron beds, which were fortunately retained after several negotiations, all other furniture had to be newly made. Two hundred students from the preparatory class are temporarily living in the College of Agriculture. The problem of student dormitories will become more serious this autumn. If, as in last autumn, about 1,000 new students are admitted again, and only over 200 students graduate this summer, how will the increased 600 or 700 people be accommodated? In today's high cost of labor and materials, building additional dormitories will be impossible. Therefore, the only solution is to estimate the capacity of the existing rooms to accommodate the increased number of people and set a quota for admission.

The original School Affairs Office (Gongzi Hall) front section and Yichun Courtyard of the faculty and staff dormitories have been extensively renovated and are still used as dormitories for single faculty and staff. In addition, behind the gymnasium, the enemy built 36 bungalows, which are located close to the meteorological observatory and are commonly known as the Thirty-Six Quarters. Most of the rooms are still retained and used as dormitories for single faculty and staff. As for faculty and staff residences, the original three areas, North Courtyard, West Courtyard, and New and Old South Courtyards, can accommodate more than 140 families after repair and renovation. In addition, 40 small houses (Mingsheng Yincun) have been built south of the Xiaohua River, but they are still insufficient for distribution. This is because the number of departments and students in the school has increased in recent years, and the number of faculty and staff must also be increased accordingly. Moreover, the school is located in the suburbs, and if teachers are hired and have families, housing must be provided. If they commute to and from the city, it will not only affect teaching but also incur additional expenses, which they will be unable to afford with their meager income. This housing problem is a unique difficulty for the school.

The outdoor scenery of Tsinghua Garden seems to be the same at a glance, but the roads in each area still need to be repaired, and the ash and coal slag left by the enemy are still being cleared. Fortunately, all the trees in the school were not cut down by the enemy, but due to years of disrepair, some have died, and some have grown too densely and need to be checked and pruned. This will be carried out as soon as the weather warms up. It is hoped that by the time the flowers bloom in early spring, the gardens will be clean and tidy, and the streams and ponds will be clear, restoring the old appearance of the beautiful scenery of Tsinghua. When our alumni return to campus at that time, their first impression will be that the scenery is no different. However, the internal wounds are deep and huge, and it will not be easy to recover without several years of manpower and financial resources.

### Three Chinese Children Perform Music in the United States and Win Praise from the New York Press

The three are currently in the United States awaiting a reply from their sponsor (the China National Children's Welfare Association) on whether they can continue their tour. The reason for their suspension is that their income is not enough to cover their expenses.

He denied reports in the local newspapers that the three children were on the verge of bankruptcy, and said that they still have enough funds to return to Shanghai.

### Fine Cloth Prices All Decline

Yesterday's cotton cloth market, because the amount of 12-pound red dragon head fine cloth supplied by Fangjian Company the day before was not much, the industry absorbed and pushed it up, and there were eats at 3,000 to 4,000 yuan above the listed price. Therefore, 12-pound dragon head fine cloth once quietly reached more than 157,000 yuan. By the time of closing, the actual needs of both local and customer gangs were not smooth, and the dyeing factories were waiting to see. As a result, it was finally down by a small 2,500 yuan from the previous day, to 155,000 yuan.

### Tea Merchants Express Five Opinions Regarding This Year's Tea Loans

[Reported by this newspaper] This reporter interviewed a tea industry tycoon yesterday to ask for his opinion on this year's government-organized tea loans. He expressed five points: (1) It is proposed that the government determine in advance the maximum amount of foreign exchange that can be obtained after this year's tea export. He said: Last year's tea export resulted in only US$5 million in foreign exchange. The key is related to the slow organization of loans. Therefore, if you want to obtain more foreign exchange this year, tea loans must be organized on a large scale, and the procedures must be expedited. On the tea merchant side, it is estimated that if this year's tea can be exported according to plan, US$15 million to US$20 million in foreign exchange can be obtained. (2) It is hoped that tea loans can be issued at the lowest possible interest rate. He said: In Taiwan, the loan is only 6% per annum. (3) In order to prevent shoddy workmanship, it is hoped that the quality of tea should be raised to the highest possible standard. (4) Because labor is too expensive now, in order to reduce costs, it is hoped that within the possible range, the goal of tea mechanization can be gradually achieved. (5) In order to cooperate with various agricultural loans, it is hoped that tea farmers' production cooperatives can be widely promoted. In the future, the tea industry can lay a modern foundation through cooperatives. However, this requires long-term education and religious promotion. He finally said: Last year, the traffic China Farmers Bank and other banks organized tea loans, and the business was overly concentrated in Shanghai. Starting this year, it seems that the strength of branches in various regions should be strengthened so as to closely contact with tea merchants and obtain the greatest effect.

### Tea Market Conditions are Leisurely

The domestic tea sales, which have been narrow for a long time, have still not improved. However, those who hold goods still do not show signs of panic, so although the situation is quiet, there is absolutely no sign of falling. As for the foreign tea market, inheriting the soft wind of the past few days, coupled with the general urgent need for funds, sellers continue to sell, and buyers take the opportunity to bully again, so the trend has not improved. In terms of price, it is still weak. Moreover, the transaction volume is not as active as in the past. The current sellers are again small about the future of the selling price, so they only choose those who need it and add a little bit.

### Rediscount Refinancing: The National Bank Decides to Expand the Scope to Support Production Enterprises and Exporters

In order to support small and medium-sized production enterprises and exporters, the Central Bank launched commercial banks and firms last year to organize industrial and commercial loan syndicates to apply for refinancing and rediscount from the bank. As of now, a total of more than 9.9 billion yuan has been lent for this loan, and the Central Bank has handled refinancing and rediscount at 75% of the original loan amount. It is reported that: in order to cooperate with the emergency economic measures plan, the bank has decided to strengthen the implementation of the rediscount and refinancing methods, and the scope will be expanded. The loan targets are not limited to small and medium-sized factories, and large-scale manufacturers can also obtain the right to rediscount and refinance. Wherever there are factory cities in the country and areas where export materials are concentrated, rediscount and refinancing will be handled to serve as the last lender for various commercial banks and firms, and fulfill the responsibility of the bank of banks.

### Japanese Pharmaceutical Merchants Are Reviving: The Future of the Pharmaceutical Industry is Worrying: The Authorities Should Quickly Seek Ways to Save it

[Reported by this newspaper] According to news from the new pharmaceutical industry in this city: The Japanese pharmaceutical industry has been organized from the ashes of the war and is preparing to compete in our country's market. To this end, the reporter interviewed Mr. Gu Kemin, chairman of the Pharmaceutical Industry Association, to inquire about the actual situation. According to him: the rumors are true, and the future of our country's pharmaceutical industry will become more difficult from now on. Before the war, Japanese-made drugs were already rampant in the market, and our people were deeply affected. During the occupation, Japanese merchants, with their military support, were in a monopoly state. When victory came, the competitive situation was swept away, but due to political unrest and economic policy disconnection, the foundation of pharmaceutical factories was precarious. Fortunately, the loan was realized, and the end of the year was survived. Recently, the government adopted a protective policy to prohibit the import of Western medicines, which was expected to recover. However, pharmaceutical raw materials are also included in the prohibited cases, and there is no foreign exchange quota, and there is no way to purchase materials, so the weak pharmaceutical industry is again in a difficult situation, and the national economy and people's livelihood are extremely worrying. It is hoped that the transportation management authorities will do their best to support and prevent this national defense industry from continuing to fall. Japanese-made drugs were originally strong enemies for many years. According to the new pharmaceutical industry, the largest Japanese pharmaceutical factory, such as Yiyiye Co., Ltd., has widely issued commercial letters, requesting our country's pharmaceutical merchants to resume contact. It is expected that our dying music factory will be more affected by its competition. It is hoped that the Import Management Committee will pay attention to this situation, quickly improve the material purchase methods, and fundamentally save this endangered national defense industry.

### Bituminous Coal Market is Soft

Coal merchants have been busy with petitions and distribution of goods recently, and their economy and personnel are restrained, so the market transaction is extremely leisurely. Although the amount of bituminous coal distributed this time is small, the market has gradually become soft and flooded, and the market price continues to be weak. Bai coal, Tongdeli, Xiazi, etc. are also the same. Only Jiaozuo block has recently returned to the 1.4 million mark due to less supply.

### White Sugar is Tight Again

Yesterday, the sugar market price became tight again, and the acceptance was stronger. Green sugar was soft, and Taiwanese red rose by another 5,000 to 6,000 yuan.

### Tung Oil and Sausage Casings are High: The Export Future is Bleak

[Reported by this newspaper] The cost of Tung oil exceeds the foreign price, so although there are arrivals in various places, the cost does not match, and it is difficult to export. The New York price of sausage casings is equivalent to 6,567,000 yuan per barrel in national currency, and the Shanghai market price needs 7 million yuan, which is only enough to cover the cost. The export future is quite bleak.

### More Diesel Allocation

It is reported that the market price of diesel has recently become sluggish. It is heard that after the exchange rate adjustment, the three foreign companies, Texaco, Mobil, and Asia, continued to sell in large quantities. At the same time, because the oil distribution of Sinopec has been ordered to end, and a new institution has not yet been established, according to the past regulations of the Oil Distribution Association, the amount of oil imported by the three companies must be reported to the association in advance, and designated limited sellers, and distributors are banned from selling.

### Northeast Soybean Exports Controlled by the China Trust Bureau

Regarding the export of soybeans from Northeast China, the Northeast Administrative and Economic Commission, in view of the fact that futures trading by merchants has caused prices to soar, increasing one to two times in a few days, is deeply concerned that rising soybean prices will stimulate the prices of other food grains. It has specially stipulated that the China Trust Bureau should sell the soybeans in a unified manner and restrict their prices before exporting them overseas to earn foreign exchange. The profit distribution is one-tenth for the China Trust Bureau's profit, and nine-tenths are returned to the National Treasury by the Economic Commission. Soybeans are also specifically designated as special products. General merchants who need to export must have the soybeans inspected by the Export Soybean Inspection Office of the Economic Commission and deemed to meet the standards before they are allowed to be exported. As for goods transported from within the customs, the Northeast authorities generally do not impose restrictions.

### Bond Market Shadows

[Our Report] Recently, it has been heard that wash sales by some securities firms have spread from stocks to public bonds. According to an official from a relevant authority: The discovery of wash sales in the bond market is indeed inappropriate. The wild fluctuations in the bond market are purely the result of artificial manipulation. He pointed out: Public bond trading in this city has a rather deceptive and conspiratorial nature. The reason is that the national bonds remaining in Shanghai could not be used to collect interest in the rear during the war, so the coupons up to the twelfth period have not yet been collected. Currently, bond market trading refuses to accept national bonds that have already collected interest in Chongqing, effectively reducing the circulating chips of the unified price; it also promotes the idea that Unified Bond C will soon pass a certain threshold, in order to achieve its goal of raising prices and deceiving retail investors. Even more strangely, even red lottery tickets that have already won are being bought and sold at high prices in the market.

### British-Owned Bus Company Declares Liquidation

### Macao Gold: Allowed In, Not Allowed Out?

According to authoritative sources in the financial community, the authorities here are issuing import permits for gold indiscriminately, so that foreign gold arriving in Hong Kong is all transported to Macao.  When reporters inquired with the Director of the Hanmen Economic Bureau, he said: Macao has allowed the import of gold since November of last year, but exports are prohibited, and transshipment also requires a special application for a permit, and half of the gold must be left in Macao as a condition.  Currently, transshipment permits have been issued for the transport of approximately 600,000 taels of gold from Hong Kong to Mumbai, India; however, permits allowing transshipment to Chinese territory have never been issued.

### Industrial Oils and Waxes Sell Slowly

[Our Report] The inventory of Philippine coconut oil is exhausted, and imports have disappeared. However, due to weak soap sales in soap factories, actual sales are sluggish as a result. The market price remains stagnant at 430,000 yuan per dan, about the same as last year's 380,000 yuan per dan.  The arrival of butter from Bengbu is also scarce, with a price of 400,000 yuan per dan. The daily output of local butter is about 200 dan, but it has recently become scarce, and the market price is similar to that of Bengbu. Asphalt is in very short supply, because the prices in the production areas are already higher than in Shanghai, and adding transportation costs would make it even higher than the current price in Shanghai, so arrivals are scarce and actual sales are also slow, with no significant price fluctuations.

### Post-Liberation Yan'an: A Recollection of the Malan Battle

— March 10th, Yichuan, Northern Shaanxi News, Our Correspondent in Shaanxi, Li Qing

Hu Zongnan's elite First Division, with the overwhelming force of a thunderbolt, entered Yan'an city, which He Long's troops attempted to defend, on the morning of the 19th. Without stopping, they immediately divided their forces into two routes to continue advancing, in order to cut off the fleeing Communist army's retreat and eliminate their remaining forces.

Yan'an was the Communists' old nest and the command center of the Communist army. Their attempt to invade was not a one-day event. The reporter's recollection of the Malan battle here has its own significance of learning from the past to understand the future, and it is not intended to be seen as something of the past.

Offensive Shattered

Last year, the Yan'an Communist army once occupied Malan Town, located in the southwestern corner of Yijun County, Shaanxi Province. At that time, the New China News Agency and the Communist Party spokesperson stationed in Nanjing repeatedly issued "war reports" with exaggerated claims. Since the beginning of this year, the Communist army, from this so-called "Malan City," the location of the "Guanzhong District Commissioner's Office," broke through the fortified lines and successively dispatched troops to invade southward, reaching the northern bank of the Jing River. On one hand, they tried their best to widen the gap and form a pocket-shaped area, including parts or large parts of Xunyi, Chunhua, Tongchuan, Yao County, and Sanyuan counties. The climax was the capture of Tongrun, only ten kilometers southeast of Fuhua county seat, in the early part of last month, but the county seat remained in the hands of the Nationalist army. Later, according to Communist army documents obtained, the purpose of the so-called "Chunhua Offensive" that day was to attack Sanyuan to the east. If successful, they would further threaten the northern side of Chang'an. However, this attempt was shattered: Not only did Tongrun, Liulin Town, and Malan Town be successively recovered by the Nationalist army, the threat to Chang'an was eliminated, and the pocket-shaped position north of the Jing River was resolved, but the surviving Communist army had to retreat more than a hundred kilometers north to the Ju River basin in the northern border of Yijun County, between Huangling (中部) and Fuxian.

Pocket-Shaped Position

To understand the importance of Malan, please first describe the boundary line between the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region and the Nationalist army. The area controlled by Yan'an that belongs to Gansu Province at the end of last month was Huanxian, Qingyang, and Heshui counties (Note: Qingyang and Heshui counties were recovered by the Nationalist army at the beginning of this month), and the Nationalist army's defense line was roughly parallel to the east-west highway between Zhenyuan, Ningxian, and Zhengning counties; further east, it turned south into Ji County in Shaanxi. The boundary line of northern Shaanxi started from the vicinity south of the Fen River in the eastern part of the two counties of Yanchang and Yichuan, and from this starting point, it extended westward across the Luo River to reach the county of E; further west, it also turned south into a corner of the two counties of Huangling and Yijun. The aforementioned "pocket-shaped position" refers to the gap between Zhengning County in Gansu and Yijun County in northern Shaanxi as the "pocket mouth," and it developed southward into a pocket shape, with Malan Town located in the center of the "pocket mouth." The town has a population of less than three or four thousand and has no economic value. Yan'an's glorification of it as a "city" emphasizes its military significance.

Battle Commander Removed

The Communist army operating in this area had many units and considerable strength. Those that were discovered successively included the First Regiment of the First Garrison Brigade, the Second Garrison Brigade, the Second Regiment of the Third Garrison Brigade, and the Seventh Garrison Brigade, etc. In addition, it was heard that there was also a artillery force, all under the command of the famous Hu Liangjian (Hu had several brothers who also served as senior military officers in the Communist army). He once resisted in the east, west, and south directions, but the Nationalist army's attack was north of Malan, in order to seal the pocket mouth and turn the Communist army in the pocket shape into "objects in a bag." As a result, Hu was dismissed and transferred to another position due to the issue of responsibility for the defeat. His successor was Yang Zhengmin, the son of Yang Hucheng. From this personnel change, it should be known that Yan'an's view of the future importance of this area will only increase, not decrease.

After the Flames of War

Malan has undergone two wars, and the degree of cruelty cannot be imagined by those who have not personally visited the place. When the Communist army retreated, the people's food, clothing, as well as horses, cattle, sheep, chickens, dogs, pigs, and other livestock were all forced to be transported north. Demolishing houses and destroying homes was commonplace. Even small things such as pigsties, dog kennels, mangers, and even pots, bowls, spoons, and ladles disappeared! What did the people do to deserve such a disaster!

Yangjiadian and Liulin Town, dozens of kilometers southeast of Malan, were also once looted by the Communist army. After the retreat, a folk song circulated among the people. It is recorded below without changing a single word:

Folk Song

"The Eighth Route Army, like fish eggs, occupied every village in the border area. Yangjiadian, Liulinzi, overturning boxes, emptying cabinets, beddings, thread tassels, basins, chamber pots, large and small bundles, carrying everything. Hairpins, bracelets, earrings, quilts, doors, and windows. Baby clothes, diapers, tattered shirts, and torn pants. Chili noodles, magical medicine, leaving nothing behind, big or small. Burning houses, grass mounds, snatching things, tying up beasts. Kicking young wives, beating to death the babies in their arms. Cutting ears, cutting noses, pulling away the livestock and donkeys. Beating my eldest son, making him carry a bag of flour. Binding the people into a string, following the broken dolls in a chain. The Eighth Route Army soldiers surrounding them, driving hundreds of children to climb the mountains."

Alas! Even Avici hell cannot be more cruel than this. The Malan battle was resolved first, and Heshui and Qingyang in Gansu Province were recovered later. The southern boundary of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region has now been completely changed. Today's gap seems to have shifted north to Heshui in Gansu and Ji County in northern Shaanxi. Future changes should be one of our points of attention. Naval Elder statesman Sa Zhenbing

### Visiting Sa Zhenbing at Zhuyuan: A Chat with the Naval Elder Statesman

— Fuzhou, 13th Dispatch, Our Special Correspondent Chen Zhengyu

"Bodhisattva Sa" is a polite nickname given to Naval Elder Statesman Admiral Sa Zhenbing by the people of Fuzhou, and Admiral Sa is indeed worthy of it. Mr. Sa is kind, amiable, and approachable. He has dedicated his life to doing good deeds. Even young children in Fujian know about Mr. Sa. In terms of career, Mr. Sa has an inseparable relationship with a part of Chinese naval history. The admiral is 89 years old, a long-lived person and also a generation of heroes.

Heading Straight to the Admiral's Residence on Cangqian Mountain

It was a clear morning, and the reporter drove straight to Nantai, stepping onto Cangqian Mountain. This place is Fuzhou's "Shangri-La," with rows of Western-style houses and beautiful scenery. In the past, Westerners and consulates all gathered here, a residential area for foreigners, and the environment was quite Westernized. Cangqian Mountain has a racecourse, which is larger than the Shanghai racecourse. It was a place for foreigners to race and relax, and Chinese people were not allowed to enter. Cangqian Mountain was like Fuzhou's Public Concession. After the Anti-Japanese War, most of the Westerners returned to their countries, and Fuzhou's "residents" successively settled here.

Near the racecourse, there is a Western-style house, like an apartment in a Shanghai alley, with "Zhuyuan" (Bamboo Garden) written outside. It is said that Sa Zhenbing, the "General of Solemn Majesty," resides here. After being notified by the attendant, the reporter met with the admiral in his bedroom upstairs. The admiral greeted us with a smile. The reporter was concerned about his old life and first asked about his recent health. He said that he was old and the functions of his five senses were declining. Especially last year, he suffered from arteriosclerosis, often had asthma, and rarely went out. His daily life was taken care of by his family and attendants. The central government provided living expenses, and he rarely inquired about various changes in the outside world.

Forty Years in the Navy, Commanding the Fleet

When the reporter asked the general about his thoughts on the past, he said that he had been in the military for more than 40 years, and the vicissitudes of life were unavoidable. Mr. Sa was among the first students sent by the Qing government to study in the UK, specializing in the navy. After returning to China, he successively served as a navy guerilla-general, participated in the Sino-French War in Jiashen, was awarded the title of Grand General, assisted the Beiyang Navy, and was appreciated by the naval admiral Ye Zugui. Later, he was recommended by Ye as the Guangdong Navy Commander, commanding the Northern and Southern Navies. At the end of the Guangxu era, he was sent abroad to inspect the naval systems of various countries and gained a lot of experience. Later, he was promoted to Minister of the Navy. When the Wuchang Uprising broke out, Mr. Sa was assigned to jointly command the army and navy with Yin Chang, the then Minister of the Army, to suppress the rebellion southward. Sa was deeply influenced by revolutionary doctrines and inspired by the spirit of the Father of the Nation, so he led his troops to telegraph his support for the revolution, making a great contribution to the Xinhai Revolution. At the beginning of the Republic of China, he successively served as Chief of the Navy Department and Director General, and was honored as General of Solemn Majesty. In the thirteenth year of the Republic of China, the political situation in Fujian changed, and Mr. Sa, due to popular support, concurrently served as the provincial governor. During his tenure, he put the people first, was loyal and diligent in political affairs, and was highly supported by local people and praised by the central authorities. Today, at the age of ninety, although he has long retired from military life, he is still hired as a senior advisor to the Naval Headquarters.

Good Harbors in the North and South, Naval Defense is Important

When the reporter asked the admiral for his opinions on building a new Chinese navy, he believed that China has a long coastline, and without a navy, it is not enough to be among the strong countries. Moreover, there are good harbors in both the north and south, providing a geographical basis for establishing a navy. Qingdao in the north is an ideal harbor. Keelung in Taiwan is a southern naval base. In Fujian, in addition to Mawei and Xiamen being able to become fortresses, Sanduo Bay in Fuding is a connecting point between the coasts of Fujian and Zhejiang. The harbor is flanked by the Hengzhi Mountain in Nanguan, and its inner harbor is deep and surrounded by towering mountains on both sides. It is extremely strategically advantageous and can be used as a military port. Moreover, the water is deep enough to accommodate giant ships, making it a good naval base. Unfortunately, it has not been noticed by the Chinese people.

The most important thing in building an army is talent, and the cultivation of naval talent is time-consuming and costly; it is extremely difficult, but for the sake of national defense, the government should do its best. Building a navy is not something that can be done in a day or two, and it requires a long-term vision. The UK places great emphasis on cultivating a kind of maritime spirit when training its navy, which is worthy of emulation. Currently, the training of our new navy is supported by the United States, and we are deeply grateful. However, we should especially have the spirit of seeking self-development, so that the new Chinese navy will become stronger and strengthen the power of national defense day by day.

What Does the General Hope For? Only Early Peace

Since last year, due to poor health, Mr. Sa has rarely interacted with the outside world. Every day, his relatives read the newspaper to him so that he can get a glimpse of current affairs. He asked the reporter about the development of the domestic situation. The reporter told him that the domestic war is currently concentrated in a corner of southern Shandong, and the war is fierce. The people in the north are in deep water and fire. The Communist Party is launching a rebellion, which is greatly harmful to the country. He believes that national strength is the most important thing. After a long war of resistance, how can we start a domestic war again? Only early peace can bring about national revival, otherwise the country will not exist. How can the existence of parties be allowed? From his words, the general's deep hope for peace can be seen.

Expressing Aspirations with Simplicity, Entertaining Oneself with Poetry

The general has held important military and political positions for decades, with clean sleeves and a desolate old age. His life has always been very frugal, like an ordinary citizen. He has always been compassionate, helping orphans and the poor. The general's only hobbies are writing poetry and calligraphy. During the Anti-Japanese War, the central government specially sent him to Nanyang to comfort the overseas Chinese, which was widely welcomed by people in the overseas Chinese community. After that, the overseas Chinese donated to support the war of resistance, and the general's actions were helpful. After completing the Nanyang mission, he went to Chongqing to report back to the central government, which was greatly appreciated by the central authorities. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek repeatedly summoned him and offered his condolences. Afterwards, the general's footprints were seen in Sichuan, Shaanxi, and Gansu. Although he was in his seventies, he was energetic and able to ride a horse freely. His nearly three years in Gansu left a deep impression on the people of the Northwest. After the victory, the general returned alone. Last autumn, he suffered from arteriosclerosis, and his body became weaker day by day. He is recuperating in Zhuyuan. This generation of heroes has since retired to his hometown, until now.

### Voices of Shanghai Traditional Chinese Medicine School Students

Editor:

We are students of the Shanghai Traditional Chinese Medicine School. Our school has recently been ordered by the Ministry of Education to close again. This time, I am afraid that it is not like the previous time, and the closure will definitely become a reality. The closure of the school is of course closely related to us students. Some of us have come from thousands of miles away, and some of us have borrowed money to come here, full of hope, but a bucket of cold water is poured on us, how can we not be depressed!

The Ministry of Education's reason for ordering the closure is that our school's funding, faculty, equipment, and curriculum do not meet the standards. It is true that they do not meet the standards, and this cannot be denied. Even we students feel dissatisfied, but where can we find a qualified traditional Chinese medicine school? If there is no place to find one, we have no choice but to choose a school that we think is relatively good and enroll in it. How wonderful it would be if the education authorities could run a qualified traditional Chinese medicine school! I believe that students from traditional Chinese medicine schools across the country would definitely come running. At that time, the non-standard traditional Chinese medicine schools would naturally close down without being banned. If the education authorities cannot run a qualified traditional Chinese medicine school, then the existing relatively good traditional Chinese medicine schools should not be banned. Not only should they not be banned, but they should also be given guidance to improve and meet the standards as soon as possible. Because the power of individuals is ultimately limited. Even if national universities are run with public funds, they still cannot be satisfactory in every way, let alone private ones, let alone our principal who makes a living from patients' medical records.

Some people say, "The Ministry of Education's resolute measures are implicitly telling you not to study traditional Chinese medicine." If traditional Chinese medicine can really be eliminated, then we will not study traditional Chinese medicine. But traditional Chinese medicine is not yet at the point of being eliminated. Any discipline in the world, when it has reached the point of being eliminated, will naturally disappear without a trace without the need for external force. The fact that traditional Chinese medicine has been repeatedly destroyed but still exists is clear evidence that it has not yet reached the time of elimination. Even if we take a step back, traditional Chinese medicine can be eliminated. Is it to be replaced by Western medicine? May I ask what is the equipment, performance, and medical ethics of most Western medicine? Can they shoulder this important task? Even if we take another step back, if every Western medicine is good, may I ask how many Western medicine doctors are there in the country? Are there enough to treat the people of the country? If not enough, how will we solve it? Even if we take another step back, if the number of Western medicine doctors is enough, may I ask if the Western medicine drugs used by Western medicine can be self-sufficient and self-supplied? No matter how you say it, traditional Chinese medicine is absolutely necessary to exist at present, and our school absolutely has value to exist. A school that has value to exist is forcibly closed down, how can we be convinced, how can this be what people attending the conference hope for? Gentlemen of the education authorities, I hope you will allow us to continue studying at our original school.

Spring and Autumn

### On Handling Subject Matter

— A Long

Up until now, mankind has still been unable to live apart from the real world. Therefore, they have to deal with events and interact with people. In these ordinary things, people are often able to find some common feelings. After the writer collects these feelings, it is the so-called theme of literature. Therefore, as a worker of art and literature, the most fundamental condition is to experience actual life. Otherwise, works produced in a closed-door manner are impractical and cannot reflect reality, and their works will be destroyed.

Therefore, when collecting subject matter, one should experience it in the position of the person. For example, Cao Yu's "Sunrise," most people think this is a successful script. The author uses ordinary writing to depict the thoughts, opinions, and actions of people living in the abyss vividly. We see Chen Bailu in the play, knowing that she knows that living this way, like a monk striking the clock day after day, will not have a good ending, and the result is still to walk towards death? However, she is greedy for this material enjoyment, and she lacks the courage to leave this place and follow Fang Dasheng to the free world. Jin Ba, a social bully, has such a great potential power. The author can write these things so realistically because he has experienced them in reality before writing the script.

There are many, many such examples. In order to describe the thoughts and actions of girls, Balzac secretly peeped under the bed in his lover's room for a night. As a result, his lover found out about this matter, and when he asked her to marry him, he was sternly rejected by his lover for this reason. George Sand wanted to describe the life of a hotel waiter, so he worked as a waiter for three months. Their purpose is very simple, in a word, it is to express the people being described deeply and realistically.

As for "Youth Grass," which takes the conscription of 100,000 educated youth as the subject matter, it is really too unreal. Don't say that the author has not actually experienced it, simply put, the author has not even had a practical thought about it. Such works undoubtedly lose their value.

Literature belongs to the masses, it contains great educational significance, it can make people distinguish between right and wrong, and it can leave people with extremely deep impressions. Therefore, when collecting subject matter, it should not be hasty, and one should ask oneself, what kind of impact will this work have after it is produced?

Observation, comparison, and research are the indispensable means when collecting subject matter.

However, literary works have their own exaggeration. Within the limits of elasticity, it can help characters and events to make the expression clearer and more profound!

### The Sweet Fever

— Wish

(It magically moves people's hearts, leading to ecstasy and disappointment.)

Male-Centered

The drake and the two ducks swam toward them – the drake, naturally, in the middle, handsome and pleasing, and a little farther off, the third duck continued her rejected and unconsoled courtship. Whenever she got too close, the drake charged at her, beak wide open, driving her back. Then she would pretend not to know where she was going, wandering aimlessly, dazed, gradually inching closer to the drake who rejected her. But this trick was wasted; he had already seen through it, and finally, he attacked this poor heartbroken duck with such decisiveness that she had no choice but to flee.

– George Moore (1851-1933)

I Married Milton

Later my husband came in and locked the door; and, the blinds were already closed, now it was just the two of us.

After I took off my clothes, I climbed into bed with the Bible in my hand. He kissed me gently and read a passage to me: Solomon praised the beauty of his mistress, comparing her belly to a heap of wheat and her breasts to two twin fawns. Then he closed the book, first placing a rose petal or two inside as a memento; he spoke sweetly to me like a lover, but in a foreign language, in a rough voice – I believe it was Syriac, or Aramaic. Later, I had to climb out of bed again, kneel beside him, and thank God for his endless grace: that he made one of us a man and the other a woman, and then he said a lot more. After saying "Amen," he hugged me back into the covers, holding me tight, trembling with intense passion. I didn't say anything, just lay stiffly, he lifted my head and said, "Ah, humble stubbornness! I praise you!" He offered a cup of wine to my lips. I took a sip, but although I had originally decided to please him, I couldn't be infected by his passion. After that, he flattered me like this: telling me the beautiful story of how he went to Italy to find a bride...

Besides "Oh," "Ah," "Humph"... how could I answer him, as he spoke, carefully and tenderly stroking the curls in my hair.

– R. Graves: "Milton's Wife"

Love Letter Dear Miss Kitty:

This is a love letter, I assume you can put it aside, and if you still feel like it's a love letter, then read it.

Of course, I could have kept the main points of this letter secret and said them when we meet next time, but there's always a chance I'll get run over by a car. So, that's my motivation for writing.

After you left that day, I stared blankly at the heather in a daze... so my thoughts coalesced like this – Miss Kitty is someone I love, admire, someone who can make me happy and someone I can trust. We are neighbors, and I feel great comfort and deep pride in this. If I had actually said to Miss Kitty: "How deep... how great...", she would have been dumbfounded with embarrassment.

Well, goodbye. See you at the theater.

– A. Vogt: "Letter to K (Kennerly)"

Equilibrium

"Some stallions get crazy as soon as they see a mare," Forrest said... "But this Hollywood horse – he was great! They pulled him into the stable, he didn't shrug, didn't jump, didn't kick, nothing. But he was very excited. He stood there watching her; you could see the sides of his chest going up and down, faster and faster, more and more violently, his eyes flashing – tense and fierce. He was having trouble breathing – you could even see the muscles under his gray horse blanket strong and firm. He was a real beauty!

"She knew he was there," Forrest said, "she knew, she just neighed a little, a soft whinny. Then she shivered all over, shaking from side to side all the way down to her hooves.

"He snorted loudly from his nostrils, then, as the grooms led him around her four times, he lifted his feet high. When he walked in front of her, he snorted again, shaking his head, shaking his mane. God, it was beautiful! He was showing her off: how good-looking he was. And it was true, look, as I watched him, he strutted there, shaking his head, breathing fire, eyes shining, showing how really impressive he was...

"He circled her body three times... he was trembling. And she was ready. It seemed that since he had assured her again like that, her doubts were gone. She was no longer afraid." -- Sweet, Longstreet. "Stallion Road" (Translated from Argosy-jan.1947)

### Autumn Woods Walking at Moonrise

— Xu Zhengbai

### Sail

— Mengnong

With wind, there would be no sail in the world, the situation being just like there would be no lighthouse without a sea ship.

Whether the wind comes favorably or unfavorably, the sail is not afraid of the wind. It will embrace everything and raise a song of joy, while it will endure all the tossing, contracting and expanding freely.

When wine-like spring wind blows, it becomes intoxicated in the spring wind. When tea-like summer wind blows on its body, it feels light all over. When smoke-like autumn wind comes, it naturally returns to tranquility. When ginger-like spicy winter wind blows on its body, it will also grit its teeth, endure hardship, endure the difficult times, await temporary rest, and prepare for eternal progress.

With this kind of heart, the sail becomes heroic and resolute. The invasion of storms and rain inevitably loses the opportunity to wreak havoc on the sail.

I love listening to a beautiful song sung by a great exiled poet Lermontov, piercing like an arrow into the depths of my heart, making a permanent echo:

On the misty sea with green waves, a lonely white sail is drifting, is it seeking something in a faraway country? Is it abandoned by its homeland for something?

The wild wind howls, the waves surge, the mast bends and creaks and groans. Ah! It is not pursuing happiness, nor is it suffering from the turbulence for happiness.

Underfoot, trampling on green waves brighter than the blue sky, overhead, golden sun flashing, but the fanatical sail yearns for a storm, as if only in a storm can it obtain a moment of peace!

Truly, let this sail that dares to move forward follow the new generation and stride forward!

### An Inch of Mountain and River, an Inch of Blood 203

— Ye Jingfeng

As he was busy taking notes, the voice in the drawer rang again:

-You said this side is your responsibility, what does that mean? - Tsurumi's voice.

-I'm afraid that female rogue will really turn hostile... and search - Pingzi spoke.

-Why are you afraid of her searching? - Tsuru.

-I have a friend here! - Ping.

-Ha... who? - Tsuru.

-Miss Liu - Ping.

-Miss Liu Shi - Ping.

-Haha, you're playing tricks again! - Tsuru. (Because Pingzi also has a Chinese name called "Liu Shi").

-I'm definitely not playing tricks, she's a pitiful child who is both loyal and filial, risking her life to help her father, working for the Koreans. - Ping.

-When did you meet? - Tsuru.

-Yesterday. - Ping.

-Who introduced you? - Tsuru.

-Teacher Aoki - Ping.

-Elder Aoki introduced you to a Korean revolutionary party?

-That's what Master Nishihara wants, and it's also the grand purpose of our Aoki line... willing to let Korea be independent. But Korea is a lazy elephant, and needs an elephant trainer to train her, supervise her; then they can become friends. - Ping.

-Speaking nonsense in broad daylight! If you want people to be independent, but you want to lead them by the nose and follow you, what kind of independence is this? - Tsuru.

-This is a major national matter, I'm sorry I don't understand it very well... Maybe if we don't lead them, others will lead them! - Ping.

We were just listening to this when there was a light knock on the door, and Jiqun walked in, dressed in a different outfit; trousers, shirt, with a cap in her hand, and the rest of the decoration was her "hundred-pocket bag" and holster. In the instant of pushing open the door and sweeping her eyes, she already knew what was going on in the room, so she stepped in lightly, smiled naturally at us, gave a sweeping military salute, in a charming and vigorous posture, and then walked to my side and sat down.

"Where's Little Tiger?" I whispered to her.

"In the hall... he hasn't forgotten those snacks." Yaoqun told me with a smile in a low voice.

"Where did you chase back from?"

"The mouth of Jiaomin Lane." Yaoqun said here, noticing the sound in the drawer, "But is it hearing the Tokyo broadcast?... Why does it sound a bit like Mr. Gu..." Yaoqun didn't understand Japanese, and thought the person broadcasting sounded like Tsurumi.

I quickly told her the situation here, while translating the listening words for her:

-There's no need for a surprise attack, when I came here, they had already released all the Chinese people locked up according to Tokyo's orders... there's even less need for demonstrations; I don't think it's meaningful. I think it's best to lie low for a while at this time, to coordinate the counter-attack, and sprinkle some useful blood on more meaningful work. - Ping

Hearing this, I suddenly felt uneasy, thinking that Tsurumi shouldn't have told Pingzi about our plan for a surprise attack. Unfortunately, when Yaoqun and I were talking, we didn't hear what Tsurumi and Pingzi were saying, and we didn't know how they suddenly went from the Korean issue to the surprise attack issue.

### Ode to the North Window

— Jin Yueting

Many people have praised windows beautifully. They use it to metaphorize the moving and bright eyes of a beauty, saying: the eyes are the windows of the soul. Now I want to say: the window is the eye of the house, and the curtain is its eyelash.

Think about it, a house without windows; pitch black and damp, with moldy air. Even a person full of vitality, will become dull and restrained once they live there, like a prisoner just entering prison.

The window makes the person in the house live together with the world, giving them many beautiful things to see, and many wonderful sounds to hear. It makes them live, and this life is as harmonious as a musical rhyme, and as clear.

I praise the window because I have a window, and this window faces north.

When we first moved into this small house, the neighbors and friends all sighed for our bad luck, saying: look at this north-facing window. The winter in the north can't compare to the warmth of Jiangnan, the wind and snow will come in from the window and we won't be able to bear it.

We have to bear it even if we can't bear it, because we were assigned to it. We started to comfort ourselves, saying that although the window faces north, it is still a window after all. Any window can make us live happily, south-facing is of course good, but what's wrong with north-facing.

So we cheered up and carefully wiped the window glass, not letting a speck of dust remain on it.

In this way we began to study; day and night, the desk faced the window,

What we read was engineering. Endless numbers, endless charts to browse. When drinking tea, the numbers floated up and down with the tea stalks; when we fell asleep, we shouted out numbers in a daze. Living in the most bustling city, we had actually become infected with a terrible loneliness.

However, this loneliness will not linger for long, because the window stands in front of our faces.

We looked far away through the window. We saw the first yellow leaf falling from the sky, followed by the dense autumn feeling of endless falling leaves. At dusk, crows with black feathers perched on the big tree in front of the window, chirping hard, as if begging people for thanks, because it was the only singing bird at that time. The electric light came on, the window was covered with light, a hazy and bright eye. With this bright eye, we would see a boy with bird's-nest hair running towards a girl with flowing hair and blue clothes, whispering some words of love at the foot of the wall, and then running away secretly and happily.

Winter came. The winter in the north is indeed much colder, if the winter in Jiangnan also has to be described as cold.

However, we dared not say it was cold, for fear of wronging the window. If the cold made us suffer, it was responsible; because it faced north.

The whole winter was spent in the wind and snow.

A thin layer of ice condensed on the window glass, like a veil on a young girl's face. We couldn't see the sky outside the window, and our lives were frozen again. Heavy loneliness, complicated numbers.

We waited anxiously, listening with our ears for the passing of winter. The monotonous night watch, the sharp whistle of the train, the cawing of the black-feathered crows, the cracking of the coal flowers in the stove, and the sound of snowflakes hitting the window.

The whole winter was spent in loneliness.

However, spring was bound to come after all. The girls on the road took off their veils, and the windows also took off their veils, as clear as after the first wiping.

We looked far away through the window again. The window faced spring, and our lives also turned to spring.

We will always be grateful for the window, even though it faces north.

(Tianjin, March 1947)

### Purple Swallow

— Jin Shan

If I were a purple swallow, building my mud nest under your eaves: In the early morning, secretly peeking at the smiling dimples on your blushing face, Spring locked in your drowsy spring sleep, Then without you waving your slender hand, With a light flutter of my wings, I would fly into your dreams,

I truly envy a purple swallow, She chatters all day at your window. When lovesickness sinks into the silence of dusk, Listening to the night rain sprinkle on the window lattice; A lonely lamp accompanies spring sorrow, She just silently guards your window (Revised old work in March 1947)

### W鹤 Lou and Cuiping Mountain

— Mustard Seed

The story of the uncle killing his sister-in-law is described twice in Water Margin, once for Wu Song and once for Shi Xiu, and the latter's story is in Jixian, Hebei, and there are still relics that can be examined today. There is a W鹤 Lou on the main street of Jixian City, the corner of the dangerous building, hidden in the shade of green poplars, and the elders pass it down, which is the makeup building of Yang Xiong's stepwife Pan Qiaoyun in the old days.

Pan Mountain outside Jicheng was once a famous area in the Jifu area. Cuiping Mountain in the lower Pan is where Yang Xiong Shi Xiu killed Pan. The Ganhuasi Temple next to the mountain has a magnificent architecture, and the poems on the walls are almost full. There is a five-character ancient poem, chanting the story of Qiaoyun, which is very readable. It is recorded here. The poem says: "The sun sets on Cuiping Mountain, driving past its right side. People say the daughter of Pan, was once a wife of Yang. The prefect and the officials go to the government, and the empty room is sad and lonely. The sky of love has broken, and the Buddha's law is not pure. Ananda's precepts are destroyed, and Guanyin's bones are decayed. To this day, the dressing building is hidden by the drooping willows. A guest listens to the end, straightening his clothes and shaking his head repeatedly. At first it was said that there were nine hundred, and the gentleman did not speak. The leisurely Teng and the weeds compete, who can put it right or wrong? Call the boy and cook dinner for me, and light a bucket of wine for me. Yihe's world is far away, and this matter must not be." It is not easy to sing vulgar things in an elegant way. It is a pity that I don't know who wrote it!

At the end of the Ming Dynasty, Hong Chengchou was ordered by Sizong to lead his army out of the pass and fought with the Manchurian soldiers in Songshan Xing Mountain. The army was defeated and surrendered to the enemy. His assistant general wished for the mountain and was called Zhipu, and made a picture of green pine and red apricot, implying past events. The superior was extremely elegant, and many famous scholars and dignitaries in the early Qing Dynasty were happy to interact with him. He wrote Pan Mountain Zhi, saying that the victory of the upper Pan is in the pine, the victory of the middle Pan is in the stone, and the victory of the lower Pan is in the water. It is not as good as the Cuiping Mountain written in Water Margin, with mounds and mounds, and another kind of desolate and lonely concept.

Free Talk

### Random Talk on Solitary Mooring

— Wang Cong

"Is love conditional?" Two young friends were arguing heatedly. Finally, I was asked to criticize their words. I stopped them from expressing their reasons to each other - in fact, I had already summed up enough, and it was not just once.

"I can't answer your question with a so-called criticism. I can only express my opinion on the issue you are arguing about; because love is a strange word, and countless interpretations and debates have been made about it throughout history," I began my speech in this way, and then I said simply:

"Like the universe and life, love is an existence, and it is also difficult for us to understand its essence. We can only give a collective interpretation of what it has presented in history --

"Therefore, I think what we are debating is not what is the essence of love? (That is a question as difficult as the origin of the universe and life.) But the process of love; this, at least in my experience, has been considered a fairly simple question.

"Borrowing the words you often use when arguing with each other, I say that love is a journey from conditional, rational departure to unconditional, emotional realm."

The two young friends thanked me and left without objection.

After reading Fang Jun's great work "Love, Divorce, and Husband and Wife" from Free Talk, I completely disagreed with the opinions in this article. Fang Jun's meaning is that after men and women get married, they should give up all their heterosexual friends, at least not allow them to associate with heterosexual friends alone.

Here, I would like to frankly express my views.

Everyone (regardless of gender), I think if we use a circumference to perfectly illustrate it, the maximum area or maximum achievement that can be obtained in their body or soul field is only 180 degrees, and if they want to complete 360 degrees, then they have to rely on another life.

In fact, it is difficult for everyone to complete their own maximum area or maximum achievement. Therefore, they will never enjoy true perfection, but it does not affect their one-sided subjective happiness.

Great people, such as Tolstoy, Goethe - ... In my opinion, they are able to feel the sadness of the sunset especially because they have completed 180 degrees of their souls. If you accuse them of abusing love, then it is too unfair. Because they cannot obtain the other half of the circumference. Magnificent buildings are often home to vulgar markets, and beautiful bodies often hide crude souls. (To be continued)

### Proposal of the 60 Central Committee Members - Requesting the Immediate Replacement of Chen Yi

— Flying Dragon Flying Dragon

Sixty Central Committee members requesting the dismissal of Chen Yi - if this news is true, then the wise government can quell the anger of the Taiwanese people.

We are not clear about the current situation in Taiwan; however, one thing can be seen: Chen Yi's style does not fully conform to the intentions of the highest authorities; for example, the highest authorities said that the Taiwan riots should be handled peacefully, but the Taiwanese military and police were dispatched, with a post every three steps and a police officer every five steps, completely in a military state. Also, with the government's consent, the Taiwan慰劳团 (comfort group) went to Taiwan to comfort the people, but it is said that they were monitored by the military and police personnel of the Chief Executive's Office for one night, and were forced to fly away from Taiwan the next day.

This shows that Chen Yi thought subjectively that force could suppress the riots as much as possible, but in fact, this is wrong.

The riots of the people are sometimes temporarily motivated by righteous indignation, and perhaps there are excesses; but a part of it is probably still that the Taiwan Provincial Government and the Taiwanese people have indeed had gaps and resentment for more than a year. If the government can understand the people's feelings and abandon the root causes of the problems, the situation will not be difficult to ease.

Therefore, the fact that the sixty Central Committee members of the Third Plenary Session asked the government to dismiss Chen Yi is an extremely wise move. As long as these people who have been in the hands of the enemy for five or sixty years can indeed change them and turn to the motherland again, this does indeed depend on the government's careful consideration of the current situation in Taiwan.

### The Relationship Between Men and Women in Shanghai

— Shi Juanying

In the eyes of the people in the flying world, the relationship between men and women in Shanghai is relatively forward. However, the people of Shanghai themselves know that this step is neither forward nor backward, and is quite embarrassing. The combination of men and women in the countryside must go through marriage. The people of Shanghai regard living together as common. With the relationship of living together, they can go in and out together just like married couples.

However, the people of Shanghai still have to take this living together seriously. After living together, both parties are mutually responsible, which is cohabitation in legal terms. At this time, if one party suddenly does not want to cohabit, there is the possibility of being accused of abandonment. On the one hand, it is a casual arrangement, which seems quite free, and on the other hand, if you regret it after living together, you cannot get rid of it equally freely. It is really a painful thing for the people of Shanghai to live in this society and cannot escape this contradiction. Naturally, the woman and the child will suffer in the end.

Recently, a certain son of a wealthy man, Yu, was accused of abandonment by a woman surnamed Chen. According to Chen, this young master Yu is a person without a formal wife, all of whom are living together. But when Yu talked about the son of the woman surnamed Chen, he said, "I don't know if the child is mine." Regardless of whether what the two said is true or false, it is indeed visible that the relationship between men and women in Shanghai is one step ahead of the countryside. The embarrassment is that although the two are not formally married, they cannot break up casually. A woman raises a son, and she has to recognize his father for him, in order to not only determine his identity, but also to have a financial support for him. Our society acquiesces in the convenience of women's free association with people, but does not give them the second step of protection. The only thing they have is to cry and beg that man. This is a pathetic protection without independence.

The second pitiful thing is the "crystallization of love." His identity is shaky and uncertain. Although I was surprised that when the abandonment case was opened, a sympathetic reporter on the scene made a special note in his pen. It was said that the child looked very similar to Yu, so that the man could not deny it. Isn't it a pitiful thing that a child has to look like his "father" (and perhaps have a blood test in the end) to be considered his son? However, what is even more pitiful is the education that the child receives. Not to mention dropping out of school due to poverty. The court asked him: "If you don't go with him (Yu), what do you want?"

"I want money"!

Reading these three words, you can hear his voice, and everything that this child has gained from such a parental relationship is also said in these three words.

Master Taixu

### A Nightly Chat - The So-Called "Silent Feeling"

— Huang Liang

In the winter of the thirty-fourth year [of the Republic, i.e., 1945], Dharma Master Taixu resided at the Chang'an Temple in the accompanying capital of Chongqing. My friend, Mr. Qin Yiyun, having dreamt of his sister (who lived in an occupied area) suffering greatly from illness, received news after the victory that his sister had passed away long ago. The suffering she experienced at the end of her life was exactly as he had seen in his dream. Therefore, one night, he urged me to visit the Dharma Master together to inquire about the profound meaning of the soul in Buddhism. The Dharma Master said, "In Buddhism, there are six supernatural powers that can connect with spiritual feelings. Recently, some people can cause the 'other mind' to, in a hypnotic-like state, understand all the forms and sounds in the spiritual realm. This is the fifth supernatural power. Previously, Mr. Wu Tingfang was able to use a state of altered consciousness to evoke feelings, which was a preliminary achievement in spiritual studies. There are also people in India who can do this. As for hypnosis, the term is not very appropriate. It should be changed to 'Silent Feeling' to be more accurate. He advocated this theory ten years ago," he said.

When the Dharma Master spoke, he quoted scriptures and explained in great detail. Unfortunately, my knowledge was limited, and I could not fully understand. Now that the Dharma Master has passed away, his disciples may collect his posthumous writings and compile them into a special book. Therefore, I am recording the general outline of what I heard for future reference.

### News Highlights

— Tie Yun

There are many rumors about so-and-so senior official coming to be the mayor of Shanghai. In fact, Shanghai needs a five- or ten-year construction plan. Whether so-and-so senior official comes or goes, this plan must be implemented unchanged.

The geishas accompanying bathers in Chengdu only earn 50,000 yuan per month. Living in this society is truly like being preyed upon by "kidney-faced, fanged" blood-sucking "demons," just hearing about it is enough to make one shudder.

The weather is suddenly cold and suddenly hot. Doctors say that smallpox, meningitis, and diphtheria are prevalent. Citizens must open their windows more often and eat more fruit. But it's a pity that there are many people living in pigeon coops, what can they do if they have no windows to open? As for fruit, it is a luxury that ordinary citizens dare not hope for. In these days of constant worry about running out of food and fuel, can they still often taste Florida honey pomelos and foreign lemons?

Heavens, let them die of illness! What does it matter about infectious diseases and "terminal illnesses"? White rice and green vegetables are what matter!

The Henan Provincial Assembly passed an important case, the content of which is: "Warning a certain newspaper reporter." If a reporter can be "warned," it shows the extent to which "reporters" have been "devalued" today.

A colonel officer being reduced to a street vendor seems to be a legitimate way for demobilized military officers to make a living, but unexpectedly, he was arrested and brought to court for it.

Although the "colonel" has been demoted to a "street vendor," he is innocent.

### United Nations General Assembly Newsreel - A Valuable Short Film

— Chi

Currently, playing simultaneously with Cathay and "Mysterious Lady" is also the "United Nations General Assembly Newsreel" held in London. This is a short film of supreme historical value. (British Prime Minister Attlee delivered the opening speech, welcoming representatives from various countries. He then expressed the determination of the United Nations to strive for peace. Today, in order to preserve humanity and maintain world peace, all factors that could lead to war must be completely eradicated.) But Attlee's speech was not just empty words, but was expressed with concrete objects. For example, the horror of war, the screen showed the true image of war. As for the atomic bombing of Nagasaki, the screen showed the real scene of the bombing of Nagasaki at that time. Dr. Wellington Koo, the chief representative of our country attending the United Nations General Assembly, also appeared frequently in this film. This is a more meaningful short film than "Is Hitler Alive?" We sincerely recommend it here.

### Prosperity and Unity - One of the Current Affairs Couplets

— Ya Mu

Mr. Tian Fang wrote current affairs couplets for a certain daily newspaper. His ingenuity and skillful hand were universally praised and widely recited for a time. Now, I am imitating his style and trying to create a new couplet. To avoid the ridicule of continuing something inferior after a masterpiece, I am afraid it will be very difficult! - Written by the author at sea, March 19th.

Must revitalize domestic goods, only then can we become strong, beware of empty talk, turning illusions into empty promises;

Without achieving peace, how can there be unity? Who can sincerely handle affairs, true worth is as rare as a unicorn or phoenix feather!

New Knowledge

### The Miracle of the Human Body

— Nan

Once you understand most of the reasons for the human body and its health, "you will wonder why people get sick." A doctor said, "If my patients had sufficient rest, proper food, and peace of mind, more than 90% of diseases could heal without treatment." Because the human body, like a ship, can repair those minor damages to daily health, as well as the body after acute illnesses.

Human organs often have reserves when needed. When a person suffers from tuberculosis, although a part of it is destroyed, he still has more lung tissue than he needs. He uses the reserve power to maintain his life.

There was a doctor who had only a small portion of healthy lungs left, but he still worked for forty years. Facts tell us that a person can live normally after losing two-fifths of his liver. Often when we see doctors performing surgery, cutting off or tying off thirty or forty blood vessels, we will definitely wonder what will happen to these blood vessels after they stop circulating? But we still have more than we need. Each person has about twenty-two feet of intestines, but if we take away three or four feet, we will not have any problems.

When the heart valves become inflamed or deformed, the situation is like half of a door opening. As they gradually deform, the heart slowly thickens, and the muscles gradually strengthen. A heart that is normally the size of a fist can increase to two, three, or even four times that size. A person must do this, otherwise, he will not be able to live.

After a doctor removed one kidney from a patient, the other one began to grow to twice its size and do twice the work. All the tissues were rebuilt. You must know that the construction of the kidney is more complex and different than ordinary buildings. This amazing ability is what is called "the miracle of the human body."

Another natural defense is rest. If you twist your muscles, before the doctor comes, the natural force puts on a splint, because the twisted place becomes so painful and difficult to move, so that we dare not move it. When a person is extremely emotionally agitated, or extremely frightened, he naturally says, "Rest!" So the person loses consciousness, he "faints!"

Divine power has given us great healing abilities to keep us healthy. He has a never-tiring intelligence. Those doctors are imitating it. When we are fighting against diseases, we often have a great intelligence and power working on our side.

### Record of a Besieged City

— Qin Shouou

June 29th of the Same Year

Some people in Hengyang are willing to fight hard battles, and the situation on the front line has surprisingly improved somewhat. The situation in Guilin has also unexpectedly eased.

On the main street, soldiers wearing khaki uniforms, carrying guns and shoulder poles with pots and stoves, passed by in an endless stream under the scorching sun. They had all traveled long distances from the rear. — Trains and cars were busy抢遝 transporting supplies, so of course they had no time to transport them. Generally, their spirits were very tired, and some had already suffered heatstroke, but they still had to hurry. The heavier things were carried on horseback. The horses were tired, but the things they carried were not light, and they had not been unloaded for rest for two or three days. The skin on the horses' backs was broken in many places due to prolonged friction. Several horses fell on the street and rolled around. Looking at the strips of bloody red flesh exposed on their backs, you could understand why they were in so much pain that they rolled around on the ground.

Cars, station wagons, and shiny chartered cars came and went non-stop, carrying big merchants, big bankers, and quartermasters in neat uniforms who never went to the front line. But they had no mind to pay attention to these groups of people and horses who were relying on their own legs to rush to the front line to fight desperately with the powerful enemy. Because the war situation had changed, business conditions naturally had to change. Some goods had fallen in price, while others had risen. Some bulky things that originally had to be abandoned in Guilin, now that there was enough time, everyone had to change their minds again. Therefore, they were really busy.

Little Shen hitched a ride on Xu Shaoming's seven trucks transporting electrical materials to Liuzhou and back. He returned today.

"Your wife might come tomorrow, so as an old friend, I'm giving you a heads-up—" he said to Fatty Xu in a teasing tone.

Xu Shaoming was at home inviting the assistant managers of the China Tea Company to dinner. Lan and Jin Aili had already finished dinner and were taking Fei Fei and Rong Er to enjoy the cool in the yard. Only the two of them were still toasting each other in the dining room.

Little Shen looked at Jin Aili as if he hadn't seen her. He had long forgotten this woman.

"Really?" Xu Shaoming received this ominous news and felt a chill down his spine.

Little Shen first waved a clean white handkerchief on a rattan chair a few times before sitting down.

"Who would lie to you!"

The assistant managers with blood-red noses also smiled knowingly at Lao Xu. (2) (1)
